Sister Peg authorial attribution case

This repo contains code used for Mark J. Hill and Mikko Tolonen's "A Computational Investigation into the Authorship of Sister Peg" in *Eighteenth-Century Studies*
(Volume 54, Number 4, Summer 2021).

Scripts (held in the "r" subdirectory) used to conduct the analysis conducted numerous (and I mean numerous) tests using various combinations of feature selection and measurement. **For technical details on methods which worked best for attribution see publication.**

Training and test material is not included with this repo for copyright reasons. The exact works and editions used are included in the appendix to the publication.
