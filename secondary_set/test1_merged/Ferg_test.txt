BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH, OR MEMOIR, OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL PATRICK FERGUSON 
ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR THE 


The folloxtiing Biographical Sketch, or Memoir of LieutenantColonel Ferguson, "was uritten by Dr Ferguson, for the purpose of being published in the Encyclopcedia Britannica ; but being considered by the Editor as too long for that xvork, and the Doctor declining to abridge it, it ivas not inserted, A few copies are nolo printed from the original sketch. 

Ferguson, Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick, was killed in the action at King's Mountain, South Carolina, 7th October 1 780. The esteem and affection of his brother officers dictated the following Epitaph, which was inserted in the New York Gazette of 14th of February I78I : 

If an ardent thirst for military fame, 
a social and benevolent heart, 
an uncommon genius, 
a mind glowing with patriotic fire, 
replete with useful knowledge, 
and capable 
of persevering under difficulties 
where glory was in view, 
claim our admiration; 

the fate of 
MAJOR PATRICK FERGUSON*, WHO POSSESSED THESE AND OTHER VIRTUES IN AN EMINENT DEGREE, AND WHO FELL WARRING AGAINST DISCOBD, IRRESISTIBLY CLAIMS OUR TEARS. 


* Major Ferguson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel soma time before liis death ;— a cii-cumstance which seems to have been unkaown to his brother officers at New Y«rk,

Superior military genius is but rare among the gifts of nature ; and of those who are endowed with it, many are stopt short in the early stages of a profession of which they are forward to incur the dangers. Such as survive those dangers, and attain to eminent stations in the service of their country, are secure of their fame. For those who fall prematurely it is but fair, as often as they can be distinguished, to affix to their memory the marks of honour they covet, and for which the votaries of profit will not surely contend with them. 

If the young man who is the subject of the present article had escaped the dangers to which he was so often exposed, it is probable that the annals of his country would have spoken more fully for him. 

He was second son of James Ferguson, Esq. of Pitfour, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary in Scotland, by Anne Murray, daughter of Alexander Lord Elibank ; and, with this descent, fortunately united in his own character, the calm judgment and exalted abilities of his father, with the vivacity and genius of his mother's family. 




Those who associate ferocity with the military character, will hardly believe in what degree a person so fond of the military life, was humane and compassionate to his enemies, as well as affectionate and generous in his friendships. But these dispositions, however in appearance little suited to war, are the appurtenances of great courage ; and bring along with them a passion for scenes of hardship and danger, in which magnanimity, in all its exertions, has the free'st scope. 

Whatever circumstances there may have been to be regretted, in the origin and progress of a war between Great Britain and her revolted colonies, there never was any service in which the officers of the British army appeared to more advantage. 
Diligent, obedient, indefatigable, and humane as well as brave, they generally prevailed in the fortune of arms, and moved through the streets, villages and farms of those who were in arms against them, as in the country of a friend ; a general character we are happy to prefix to the particulars which occur to be mentioned, relating to the per?ion who is the subject of this article. 

He was born in the year 1744 ; and, having early chosen the life of a soldier, was sent to finish his 





education at a military academy in London, where he acquired the elements of fortification, gunnery, and other arts subservient to his intended profession. Of these he afterwards pursued the study in real situations — in action as well as on paper ; 
and was sagacious, original, and inventive in the application of expedients to actual service. 

His first commission was purchased for him at the age of fourteen, in the Royal North British Dragoons ; and he gave, while yet a boy, many striking proofs of sensibility to the military character, and of his spirit in supporting it. Of these, which were indeed habitual to him, it may not be improper to mention two instances ; one in particular, in Germany, when, not having completed his l6th year, being on horseback a few miles in front of the army, with another young officer of the same regiment, (Sir John Mitchell,) they fell in with a party of the enemies' hussars, and, finding it necessary to retire, were pursued. Ferguson, in passing a ditch, dropped one of his pistols ; but thinking it improper for an officer to return to camp with the loss of any of his arms, he re-leaped the ditch in the face of the enemy, and recovered his pistol. They halted, imputing probably his confidence to some support which he saw at hand, allowed him to repass the ditch, join his companion, and regain their camp undisturbed. 

The other happened at Paris some years after, with an officer in the French service, who spoke reproachfully in his presence of the British nation. 
This insult he not only resented on the spot, but surprised his antagonist next morning with a visit before he was out of bed " This is well, young " man," said the other : " I have paid such visits, — 
" seldom received them j but it is fair to tell " you that I am reputed one of the best swords" men in France." — " That is not the question " now," said Ferguson : " You are in my debt, " let us find a fit place to settle our accounts." 
They accordingly went to the Boulevards together ; Ferguson considering how he might deprive this swordsman of the advantage of his superior skill, and the other regarding with security and contempt so young an antagonist. As soon as they had drawn, Ferguson rushed within his adversary's point, seized the hilt of his sword, and in the scuffle was so fortunate as to get possession of it. ** You are a brave fellow," said the other ; 
" and I shall certainly do you justice whenever " our affair is mentioned." 



He had scarcely finished his first campaign, when he was disabled by sickness ; and having been for some months confined under the care of the physicians and surgeons of the army*, was sent home when in a condition to be removed. His words, in a letter to his friend General Watson, some time after, are as follows : " I am now entire" ly recovered, and might serve the next campaign " with ease, had not the fears of my parents prompt" ed them to apply for an order for my joining the " light-troop ; by which means I am deprived, for " these many years to come, of the only chance of ** getting a little insight into my profession." 

Being much at home from the year I762 to the year I768, he entered warmly into the question which was then agitated relating to the extension of the militia laws to Scotland. He saw no difficulty in combining the character of a soldier with that of a citizen, so far as was necessary for the defence of a country in which citizens enjoy such invaluable privileges; and some of the ablest and most intelligent publications which appeared in the public prints of the time, were of his writing. 



* The late Dr Armstrong, author of the celebrated poem of the Ai-t of Preserving Health, Sec. was then physician to the British forces in Germany, and formed upon that occasion the warmest friendship and affection for young Comet rERGBsoN, which continued to his death. 



In 1768 a company was purchased for him in the 70th regiment of foot, then in the West Indies, and he soon after joined that part of it which was in Tobago, where he was of great service in quelHng very formidable insurrections of the negroes ; but after much distress in this situation from bad health, he went to North America, and returned to Great Britain in 1774s where he remained about two years. 

During this interval a dispute with the North American colonies was verging to a civil war ; and the boasted skill of the Americans in the use of the rifle, was held out as an object of terror to the British troops, whom it was said the American marksman could unofficer by lodging his ball from a distance, within the compass of the smallest mark. 

These rumours set Ferguson's invention to work on a new species of rifle, which he could load at the breech without the use of a rammer, and in such quick repetition as to fire seven times in a minute. The riflemen, in the meantime, might be stretched at full length on the ground, so as to have the cover of a parapet behind even a consolidated mole-hill, or the least inequality of the earth's surface. 




The first exhibition of this invention was made before Lord Townsend, then master-general of the ordnance.* It was afterwards practised by some private men of the Guards at Windsor, that the King might have an opportunity of seeing its effects. 
When his Majesty was pleased to give orders for that purpose, a few men who had learned the use of the rifle were brought to perform in his presence, but, being overawed, in their first attempts shot wide of the mark : *' They would not," said 


» The following account of this exhibition will be found in the Chronicle of the Annual Register for 1776, of date the 1st of June. 

" Some experiments were tried at Woolwich before Lord Viscount TowNSHKND, Lord Amherst, Generals Hervey and Desaguiliers, and a number of other officers, with a rifle giin, upon a new construction, by Captain Fergdson of the 70th regiment ; when that gentleman, under the disadvantages of a heavy rain and a high wind, performed the following fonr things, none of which had ever before been accomplished with any other small arms. 
1st, He fired dm-ing four or five minutes at a target, at 200 yards distance, at the rate of four shots each minute. 2dly, He fiied six shots in one minute. 
3dly, He fired four times per minute, advancing at the same time at the rate of four miles in the hour, ithly. He poured a bottle of water into the pan and barrel of the piece when loaded, so as to wet every grain of the powder, and in less than half a minute fired with her as well as ever, vrithout extracting the ball. He also hit the bull's eye at 100 yards, lying with his back on the ground ; and, notwithstanding the unequalness of the wind and wetness of the weather, he only missed the target three times during the whole course of the experiments. The captMQ has since taken out a patent for the said improvements. " the captain, " be so embarrassed in presence of " your Majesty's enemies." 

Ferguson then took a rifle himself j and of nine shots which he fired at the distance of a hundred yards, put five balls into the bull's-eye of the target, and four within as many inches of it. Three of these shots were fired as he lay on his back, the other six standing erect. Being asked how often he could load and fire in a minute, he said seven times ; but added pleasantly, that he would not undertake in that time to knock down above five of his Majesty's enemies. The recollection of which he was capable in the most arduous situations, gave him at all times the ease of an experienced courtier. 

He wished to be employed in the armaments which were then preparing for the continent of North America, and was accordingly indulged with instructions to the Commander-in-chief, to have a corps of volunteers draughted from the regiments on the American service, to have them armed in his own way, and put under his command. 

This commission was agreeable to him, chiefly because it gave him a species of separate command, and left him to conduct a corps which was formed upon a principle different from that of the rest of the army. He gave a signal specimen of its services at the battle of Brandywine, when, being advanced in the front of the column commanded by General Knyphausen, and supported by the rangers under Colonel Wemys, he scoured the ground so effectually that there was not a shot to annoy the column in its march. His merit on that occasion was acknowledged throughout the army, and fully stated in the reports of the day to the Commander-in-chief, by whose order the following letter was written to him by the Adjutant-general. 

" Head-quarters, IMi September Yjl'^7, " Sir, ** The Commander-in-chief has received from " Lieutenant-general Knyphausen the most hon" ourable report of your gallant and spirited be" haviour in the engagement of the 11th, on which " his Excellency has commanded me to express his " acknowledgements to you, and to acquaint you, ** Sir, that he shall with great satisfaction adopt any " plan that can be effected to put you in a situation " of remaining with the army under his command. 

" For the present, he has thought proper to in" corporate the rifle corps into the light companies 
of the respective regiments. I am very happy " to be even the channel of so honourable a tes" timony of your spmted conduct, and of that of " your late corps. And I am, Sir, with perfect " esteem and regard, 
" Your most obedient humble vServant, 
(Signed) " J. Paterson, Adjt. Gen^.*" 

^* Capt. Ferguson, 
" commanding " the Rifle Corps," 



His corps, though advanced immediately before, suffered considerably less than the rangers, from the advantage of being able, wherever they came under the enemy's fire, to use their arms as they lay on the ground. The rangers had seventeen men killed, and Ferguson's corps only two men wounded, of whom he himself was one. 


* It was well known in the anny that the Commander-in-chief, Sir William Howe, had taken umbrage at the rifle corps having been formed without his being consulted. It was therefore perhaps not to be expected that he would exert himself to support it. The use of which it had proved, to the great satisfaction of the army, seems to have prevented him from taking active steps to its prejudice, until Captain Ferguson was wounded at Brandywine; of which Sir William took advantage, and reduced the corps without consulting him. It seems extraordinai7, however, that Sir William should have carried his chagrin ■ao far as to take no notice, in his official letter to the Secretaiy of State, of the •onduct of Captain Ferguson, and of the behaviour of the riflecorps in the action of Brandywine, notwithstanding he had given him the public thanks stated above on the occasion. Upon that circumstance being discovered, when the Xondon Gazette, containing Sir William's official letter, arrived in America, Captain Fergusok sent a copy of these thanks to the Secretary of State. 


^VTiile he lay with a part of his riflemen on the skirts of a wood, in the front of General Knyphausen's division of the army, the following circumstances happened, which he relates in a letter to a friend : " We had not lain long,'* 
he says, " when a rebel officer, remarkable " by a hussar dress, passed towards our army, " within a hundred yards of my right flank, ** not perceiving us. He was followed by an** other dressed in dark green, or blue, mounted " on a bay horse, with a remarkably large cock<' ed hat. I ordered three good shots to steal '* near to them, and fire at them ; but the idea " disgusted me. I recalled the order. The hus" sar, in returning, made a circuit, but the other " passed again within a hundred yards of us, upon «' which I advanced from the wood towards him. On " my calling, he stopped ; but, after looking at me, " proceeded. I again drew his attention, and made «' signs to him to stop, levelHng my piece at him, " but he slowly continued his way. As I was with" in that distance at which, in the quickest firing, " I could have lodged half a dozen of balls in or " about him before he was out of my reach, I had <* only to determine j but it was not pleasant to fire" at the back of an inofFending individual, who " was acquitting himself very coolly of his duty j so " I let him alone. The day after I had been tel" ling this story to some wounded officers who lay " in the same room with me, when one of our sur" geons, who had been dressing the wounded rebel " officers, came in and told us they had been in" forming him, that General Washington was all " the morning with the light troops, and only at" tended by a French officer in a hussar dress, he ** himself dressed and mounted in every point as " above described. I am not sorry that I did not " know at the time who it was. 

" Farther this deponent sayeth not, as his bones " were broke a few minutes after." He received a ball in his right arm, which so shattered the joint of the elbow as to render it doubtful whether amputation would not be necessary. He was for some months disabled from service, and, although he preserved his arm, never recovered the use of that joint ; but, with a spirit peculiar to himself, so assiduously practised the use of the sword and of the pen with his left, that he scarcely seemed to have incurred any change but a difference in his hand-writing. What mortified him most was, that during his confinement the rifle corps, deprived of its leader, was broke up, as mentioned in the above letter from the Adjutant-general, the rifles lodged in the store of spare arms, and the men returned to their respective regiments. 

As Ferguson was now no more than a mere volunteer with the army, the regiment to which he belonged being stationed at Halifax in Nova Scotia, it was at the discretion t)f the Commander-in-chief whether he should be employed at all ; but every one concurred in favouring his pretensions, and in doing justice to his merit; and, what is uncommon, he shewed an ardour for distinction and eminence without exciting proportional envy. His brother officers ever mentioned him with esteem and kindness. One of them who kept a journal of the M^ar, observed of Ferguson, that, though careless of his own life to a fault, he was ever attentive to the means of preserving those under his command. Another who has had occasion to publish his eulogium to the world, among other expressions of esteem and regard, gives the following account of his character : 

" That in private life his humanity and bene" volence were conspicuous, his friendship steady " and sincere. To a distinguished capacity for *' planning the greatest designs, he added the ar" dour necessary to carry them into execution j his " talent for enterprize attracted the notice of the " whole army. Military tactics had been his early " and favourite study ; considered as a scholar, his " genius was solid, his comprehension clear, and " his erudition extensive. *" 

Ferguson was the friend of every man's merit, and had no enemy to his o\vn. His being employed, though out of his turn, did not give offence to officers of the same rank with himself. In the autumn of 1778, he had the command of a detachment that embarked at New York, on board of a little squadron, consisting of the Zebra, the Vigilant, the Nautilus, some galHes and small armed vessels, under the command of Captain Collins of the Zebra. The troops under Captain Ferguson amounted to three hundred ; and their instructions were to destroy a nest of rebel privateers which infested the trade of New York, from Little Egg harbour in the Jerseys. This small armament sailed from Sandyhook on the 30th of September, but, meeting with contrary winds, could not reach the port to which they were destined, though within half a day's sail, until the 5th October. During this interval the enemy, having had intelligence of their coming, put to sea with some of their larger vessels, 
* Mackenzie's Strictures. 

and removed others over the bar into shallow water. 
The latter, however, were burnt to the number often or twelve privateers, by Captain Collins, who got over the bar with his small craft, while the troops were employed in destroying their haunts and storehouses on shore. 

While Captain Collins lay in the harbour waiting for fresh orders, in consequence of the report he had made to his commander at New York, intelligence was brought by an officer who deserted from the enemy, that Polaski, an adventurer from Poland, and reported to be the same who had carried off the person of his Polish Majesty with many circumstances of audacity and cruelty, and now in the service of the American Congress, lay up the country with three companies of foot, three troops of horse, and a detachment of artillery ; and that about a mile in his front, there was a gully, or creek, with a narrow bridge upon it, which he had neglected to occupy. This last circumstance encouraged Captain Ferguson to hope that the enemy might be surprised, and, in any event, a retreat be secured by seizing the bridge. For this purpose he embarked with about two hundred and fifty of his detachment in boats, set off at eleven at night, and, after rowing about ten miles, landed at four in the morning within a mile of the pass which he was to 


seize. He left fifty men for its defence, and advancing rapidly, surprized Polaski before break of day, killed several officers, amongst whom were one lieutenant-colonel, one captain, one adjutant, and about fifty private men. * 

* This little enterprise is thus detailed in the London Gazette of 1st December 1778. 

" Extract of a Letter /ro/ra General Sir Henry Clinton, Knight of the Bath, to Lord George Germaine, dated October 25, 1778. 

" In my letter of the 8th inst. I mentioned that my move into Jersey was partly to favour an expedition sent to Egg harbour. I have now the honour to inclose copies of two reports made to me by Captain Ferguson of the 70th regiment, who commanded the troops employed upon that service, to wliich I beg leave to refer your Lordship for an account of its success, under direction of that Tei7 active and zealous officer. See Gazette for \st Report of lOtA October. 

" Report of Cajitain Ferguson of the 70th Regiment, to his Excellencif Sir Henry Clinton, dated Little Egg harbour, October 15, 1778. 

" Sir, 
" Since the letter which I had the honour of writing to you on the 10th instant, Captain Collins has received a letter from Admiral Gambier, signifying that the Admiral and you are both of opinion, that it is not safe for us to remain here, as the aimy is withdrawn from the Jerseys, and ordering our immediate return ; but as the wind still detained us, and we had infonnation by a captain and sLx men of Polaski's legion, who had deserted to us, that Mr Polaski had cantoned his corps, consisting of three companies of foot, three troops of horse, a. detachment of artillery, and one brass field-piece, within a mile of a bridge, which appeared to me easy to seize, and from thence to cover our retreat, I 
prevailed upon Captain Collins to enter into my design, and employ an idle day in an attempt that was to be made with safety, and with a probability of success. Accordingly , at eleven last night, 250 men were embarked, and, after rowing ten miles, landed at four this morning, within a mile of the defile, which 
c 

In the following spring, it was proposed to push the war from New York up the North River, and to dislodge the enemy from the posts of Stonypoint, and Ver Planks Neck, which they occupied upon that communication. When Sir Henry Clinton 


we happily secured, and, leaving 50 men for its defence, pushed forward upou the infantry of this legion, cantoned in three different houses, who are almost entirely cut to pieces. We numbered among their dead about 50, and several officers, among whom, we leani, are a lieutenant-colonel, a captain, and an adjutant. It being a night attack, little quarter could of course be given, so that there are only five prisoners. As a rebel Colonel Proctor was within two miles, with a corps of artilleiy, two brass twelve-pounders, one three-pounder, and the militia of the country, I thought it hazardous with 200 men, without artillery or support, to attempt any thing farther, particularly after Admiral Gambier's letter. 

" The rebels attempted to harass us in our retreat, but with great modesty, so that we returned at oui- leisure, and reimbarked in security. 

" The captain who has come over to us is a Frenchman, named Bromvilue. 
He and the deserters inform us, that Mr Polaski has, in public orders, lately directed no quarter to be given ; and it was therefore with particular satisfaction that the detachment marched against a man, capable of issuing an order, so unworthy of a gentleman, and a soldier. 

" It is but justice to inform you, Sir, that the officers and men, both British and Provincials, on this occasion, behaved in a manner to do themselves honour. 

" To the conduct and spuit of Captain Cox, Lieutenant Lyttleton, and Ensign Cotter, of the 50th regiment, and of Captain Peter Campbell of the 5d Jersey Volunteers, this little enterprise owes much of its success, as well as to the airangements of Captain Collins of the navy, and attention of Caplain Christian, who accompanied the embarkation. 

I have the honour to be, &c. 
(Signed) Pat. Ferguson, Capt. 70th Reg. 

P. S. The dispatch vessel not having got to sea last night, I am enabled to inform you, that our yesterday's loss consists of two men of the 5th, and one of 

moved upon this service, Captain Ferguson at the head of a detachment was advanced, as on former occasions, before the army, and became a busy actor in the operations that followed. 

Stonj-point being surprised by a party of the kings troops, Ver Planks Neck was deserted, as no longer tenable under its exposure to the guns of the other. Colonel Webster and Captain Ferguson being stationed at Ver Planks, Stonypoint was again surprised, and recovered by the enemy, its guns turned upon Ver Planks, and a heavy fire continued from thence, and from a galley which the enemy had brought to bear upon it. This attack, however, was firmly sustained by Colonel "Webster, until the galley being sunk by a shot from his battery, Stonypoint was again retaken upon a second march of Sir Henry Clinton to that quarter. It appearing that the facility with which this post had been so often taken and retaken, was 


tlie Provincials missing, and two of the 5th slightly wounded ; Ensign Camfbell «f the 2d Jersey Volunteers has received a stab through the thigh. 

" We had an opportunity of destroying part of the baggage and equipage of PoLASKi's legion, by burning their quarters ; but, as the houses belonged to some inoffensive Quakers, who, I am afraid, may have sufficiently suffered already in the confusion of a night's scramble, I know. Sir, you will think with us, that the injui7 to be thereby done to the enemy, would not have compensated for the sufferings of these innocent people. 

P. F. 


owing to a defect in the works, the charge of reforming or supplying that defect was intrusted to Ferguson, — an appointment unusual, as he did not belong to the corps of engineers, who nevertheless do not seem to have taken umbrage at it. 


That Ferguson, (who had by this time attained the rank of major,) might erect what works he thought proper, it was proposed that he should remain in the defence of the place. Flattered with this opportunity to execute what he had often been meditating, he proceeded to realize some of his favourite ideas ; and while he looked for an attack with all the anxiety of a person who waits the result of an interesting experiment, he had the mortification to receive an order to evacuate Stonypoint, and join the army at New York, now destined to carry the war into a different quarter of the continent. In a letter to a friend on that occasion, full of regret, he says, " Never did a fond mother " leave her favourite child with more reluctance " than I did that place." He had the consolation, however, of being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-colonel in America, and the prospect of being employed with distinction in the operations which were then projected. 


When the fleet and transports, with the army on board, were about to sail from Sandyhook, they had orders, in case of separation, to rendezvous at Tybee in the province of Georgia ; at this place a small division of the army was put on shore, under the command of Major-general Pattison of the Royal Artillery, with orders to penetrate into South Carolina, that the attention of the enemy might be directed to him, whilst the fleet again put to sea, and appearing suddenly before Charlestown, should land the army without opposition near that place. 

Of the first division, Ferguson, with a detachment of regulars, and Major Cochrane, brother to the Earl of Dundonald, with some companies of the British Legion, made a part. These two officers were employed to reconoitre the country, clear it of enemies, and collect boats and waggons for the use of the main body that followed. In this service, they both co-operated with cordiality and spirit ; and as in their fates,* at no great interval of time, they equally became objects of public and private regret, it is impossible for a person in doing justice to the one, not to consider the other with like affection and esteem. 


* Major Cochrane having been sent, by Sir Henry Clinton, to apprise Lord CoRNWALLis of his approach, by courage and perseverance reached York-town with the intelligence, when he soon after had his head carried oflf by a canon-ball, while standing by his Lordship's side. 


Fortunati ambo, si, quid mea carmina possunt; 
Nulla dies unquam mefnori vos eximit sevo. * 

Having on this march from Georgia to South Carolina taken different routes, they had each of them intelHgence of one Macpherson, who had assembled a body of rebels at his own plantation, nearly on that which the troops were to take on their march to Charlestown, and both at the same time formed a resolution to surprise this enemy. Ferguson arrived first, and finding that Macpherson had abandoned the place, took possession of it. Major Cochrane arriving soon after in the night, and supposing the enemy still to be there, instantly proceeded to force his way ; Ferguson, as usual at the head of his men, opposed this attack, and attempting to parry a bayonet with his sword, received a thrust in the only arm of which he had any use ; 
but while he raised his voice, to encourage his men, he was known to his friend Major Cochrane, who immediately put a stop to the conflict. Ferguson called for the man who had wounded him, and giving him a piece of money, commended his alacrity, 

saying, " We should have known our friends sooner " from their mode of attack." 

This wound for some time had an alarming appearance, and, under the effects of the climate, threatened him with the loss of his other arm. In this state of it, however, it was necessary for him to continue his march, and he rode between two orderly men who were appointed to attend him, while he himself, to have the command of his horse, was occasionally obliged to hold the reins of the bridle in his teeth. 

In a little time after he joined the army near Charlestown his wound took a more favourable turn, and he was soon in condition to take the field with his former activity. He was employed with Colonel Tarleton during the siege of Charlestown, in clearing the country of parties of the enemy, who attempted to straiten the quarters of the army; 
and, while on this service, falling in with one of their convoys, he took two hundred horses, forty waggons, all their baggage, spare arms, and accoutrements, with fifty prisoners, without the loss of a man.* 

* Letter dated Charlestown, 15th May 1780, Captain Fletcher's M. S. 
aecoimt of Colonel Fergtson. 


After the reduction of Charlestown, among the dispositions which were made to restore and preserve the province, it was proposed that the well affected should be armed in their own defence ; and Ferguson, who at this time held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in America, was appointed ma~ 
jor to the 71st regiment, on the British establishment, and entrusted with the charge of marshalling the militia over a great extent of the country ; a service for which he was particularly qualified, by his generous disposition and conciliating manners. 

In the proclamations he was intrusted to frame, the people of South Carolina were called upon by him to restore the civil government of their country, under the favourable conditions then offered by the King and Parliament of Great Britain. 

A numerous militia was accordingly soon enrolled, being allowed to name officers for themselves ; 
and, as those officers were to act as civil magisstrates also, a caveat was entered against the choice of any person who was likely to abuse his trust, by withholding from any peaceable citizen that protection to which he was entitled. 


Ferguson exercised his genius in devising a summary of the ordinary tactics, for the use of this militia; and had them divided in every district into two classes ; — one, of the young men, the single and unmarried, who should be ready to join the King's troops, to repel any enemy that might infest the province ; — another, of the aged and heads of families, who should be ready to unite in defending their own townships, habitations, and farms. In his progress among them he soon gained on their confidence, by the attention he paid to the interests of the well- affected, and by his humanity to the families of those who were in arms against him. ** We come not," he observed, " to make war on women and children," giving them money to relieve their distresses j but said, *' he hoped they would excuse him, if meeting *' with their husbands or brothers in the field, he ** should use them a little more roughly*" 

Soon after the conduct of the war in that quarter had devolved upon Lord CornwalLis, a detachment of regulars, joined with a body of militia, under the command of Colonel Ferguson, was destined to cover the interior country, and the left flank of Lord Cornwallis's army on its march towards North Carolina and Virginia. 

Having advanced towards Ninety- six, about two hundred miles from Charlestown, acting with vigour and success against different bodies of the rebels, who remained to dispute the possession of the country with him, he had inteUigence from Colonel Brown, who commanded the King's forces at Augusta in Georgia, that a body of rebels, under the command of a Colonel Clarke, who had been recently repulsed in an attempt upon the post of Augusta, was retreating by the back settlements of Carolina. To this intelligence Colonel Brown added, that he himself meant to hang on the rear of this enemy, and that if Ferguson would cut across his route, he might be intercepted, and his party dispersed. As this service was perfectly consistent with that in which he was employed, Ferguson gave way to his usual ardour, and pushed with his detachment, composed of a few regulars and militia, into Tryon county. 

In the meantime, numerous bodies of back settlers west of the Alleghany mountains, hitherto believed favourable to the British cause, were in arms, some of them with a view of seizing upon the presents intended for the Creek and Cherokee Indians, which they understood were but slightly guarded at Augusta, Others had assembled upon the alarm of enemies likely to visit them from South 


Carolina. These meeting with Colonel Clarke secured his retreat, and made it expedient for Brown to discontinue his pursuit and return to his station at Augusta, while Ferguson having no intelligence of that event, still continued the march undertaken at his request. The enemy which he now alone and unsupported was likely to encounter, is described as follows by an officer who served the campaign in South Carolina : " A swarm of back" wood's men, the wild and fierce inhabitants of '* Kentucky, and other settlements westward of the " mountains, under the Colonels Campbell and " Boon, with those of Helston, Powels Vally, " Barclay, Bottetourt, Augusta, and Fincastle, " under the Colonels Cleveland, Shelby, Sivier, *' Williams, Brand, and Lacy," had assembled suddenly and silently upon the report of a booty to be seized at Augusta. They were mounted on horseback, and by the rapidity of their motions well qualified to act by surprise.* 

When Ferguson had intelligence of Brown's retreat, and the appearance of a new enemy, he halted, with a view of returning to the parts of the country he had left. At the same time, he dispatched a messenger to Lord Cornwallis, to inform 
* Vide IUmsay's RcTolution of Ajnerica, chap. 19. 


his Lordship of what had passed,— of the enemies he had to deal with, — and of the route he had taken to avoid them ; earnestly expressing his wish, that he might be enabled to cover a country in which there were so many well affected inhabitants ; 
adding, that for this purpose he should halt at King's Mountain, hoping that he might be there supported by a detachment from his Lordship, and saved the necessity of any further retreat. 

This letter having been intercepted, gave notice to the enemy of the place where Ferguson was to be found J and though a duplicate sent on the following day was received by Lord Cornwallis, it came too late to prevent the disaster which followed. 

The enemy having selected a body of chosen men, mounted on fleet horses, performed their march sooner than otherways could have been accomplished. They were in number so superior to Ferguson's detachment, and so well acquainted with all the approaches to his position, that they made arrangements to surround him and to cut off his retreat. 

On this sudden emergence Ferguson's detachment was immediately in arms, and rushing with the bayonet on the first body of the enemy that presented themselves, forced them to retire ; but while they gained this advantage in front, they were attacked on the flanks by a fresh enemy. To these also the regulars presented their bayonets, and repulsed the enemy in three several attacks. 
" As often as one of the American parties was " driven back," says Ramsay, the American historian, " another returned to their station. Re" sistance on the part of Colonel Ferguson was in " vain ; but his unconquerable spirit refused to " surrender. After having repulsed a succession " of adversaries pouring in their fire from new di*' rections, this distiguished officer received a mor" tal wound." 

He had two horses killed under him, while he remained untouched himself j but he afterwards received a number of wounds, of which it is said any one was mortal, and, dropping from his horse, expired, while his foot yet bung in the stirrup. 

The spirit which thus refused to be subdued, being now no more, the officer on whom the command devolved, though brave and equal to the trust, was compelled to accept of quarter for himself and the few men that remained under his command, 


The first reports of Ferguson's death, though vague and uncertain, were received by his friends in the army as a matter to be hourly expected : 
" If not now,'* they said, *' it must be soon, in the " continual danger to which he exposes himself.'* 

He had estimated the part which became him to act, as the leader of such parties as were hitherto put under his command : in such services, he conceived, that he was not only to project what should be done, but to lead in the execution of it. His courage was considerate and calm. He says, in a letter to a friend, " I thank God more " for this than for all his other blessings, that in " every call of danger, or honour, I have felt " myself collected, and equal to the occasion." 
Anxious to reconcile his parents to the risks to which he was so frequently exposed, he makes the following observation : •* The length of our lives " is not at our own command, however much the " manner of them may be. If our Creator enable " us to act the part of men of honour, and to con" duct ourselves with spirit, probity, and humani" ty, the change to another world, whether now, " or fifty years hence, will not be for the worse." 

Of the millions who were born on the same day or year with Colonel Ferguson, the longest liver will die at no great interval of time, and none in a manner more worthy of the part which Providence had assigned him to act. 

The body lay stripped on the ground, while the men lately under his command, now prisoners of war, desired leave to bury his remains with what they termed the honours of a soldier's grave ; but this request, addressed to the recent feelings of a ferocity which resented the opposition even of the most generous enemy, was refused. This token of respect and affection, however, was paid to the deceased, by the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, who, having experienced his humanity, gave the body a decent interment in their own buryingground. 

Having noted the respect and affection expressed for Colonel Ferguson by his brother officers, in the epitaph prefixed to this memoir; the person who offers this imperfect sketch, hopes that he will be pardoned the ambition of erecting this monument also to his memory. 

THE END. 


Of many Poetical Effusions that appeared in the Public Prints on the death of Lieut.-Colonel Ferguson, the following have been accidentally discovered since the foregoing Memoir was printed. 


Here Soldiers sighing o'er a Hero's grave, 
Tell how he fought and died. — Here Genius bends, 
Mourning the Patriot worth she could not save. 
While social Virtue weeps the best of Friends. 



Here bleeding Pity, viewing what is done. 
In silent woe laments her darling Son ; 
For ne'er a milder Warrior thus was laid — 
His generous breast no evil e'er repaid ; 
His heart no selfish passion ever felt. 
For THERE the chastest love of glory dwelt. 
His martial ardour tend'rest feelings crown'd, And, but too daring, not a fault was found. 
Let Honour pay the debt his actions claim ; 
Let Candour give to future time his Fame. 
Let grateful Britain, to her children just, With never-fading laurel shade his dust ; 
His gallant deeds her youthful Soldiers tell. 
Teach them, like Him, in glory to excel: 
For this he fought — For this, alas, he fell!

c H A P. or presages of evils which were yet to afflict _A-,-_ the republic of Rome. At this time indeed the
State of Italy seemed to have received the feeds of much trouble, and to contain ample materials of civil combustion. Ever fiince passing the Agrarian law, the Roman citizens, for whom no provision had been made at their return from military ser- vice, or who thought themselves partially dealt with in the colonies, the leaders of tumult and faction in the city, were now taught to confider land property as their joint inheritance. They were, in imagination, distributing their lots, and feleding their ihares.
In the mean time, the inhabitants of the Muni- cipia, or free towns, and their diftrids, who, not being Roman citizens, took part with the State as fubjeds, had reason to dread the rapacity of such needy and powerful sovereigns. They themselves likewise began to repine under the inequality of their own condition. They observed, that while they were scarcely allowed to retain the possessions of their fathers, Rome, aided by their arms, had gained that extensive dominion, and obtained that territory, about which the poor and the rich were now likely to quarrel among themselves. And "the Italian allies," they said, " must bleed in "this contest, no less than they have done in the "foreign or more diltant wars of the common- "wealth." They had been made, by the pro- sessions of Tiberius Gracchus, to entertain hopes that every diftindion in Italy would soon be re-
moved,
moved, that every freeman in the country would c i A ; be enrolled as a citizen of Rome, and be admitted x to all the poweis and pretensions implied in that designation. The consideration of this fubjccd therefore, could not long be delayed; and the Ro- man Senators, already struggling with the claims of their fellow-citizens, had an immediate florin to apprehend from the allies.
Transitions equivalent to revolution had been so frequent in this republic, and its progress from finall beginnings :to a great empire had been so rapid, that the changes to which men are expofedi and the exertions of which they are capable, ho where appear so conspicuous, nor are they any where so diftindly marked.
In the first ages of Rome, the difiincive impor- tance of a citizen appears not to have been fenfi- bly felt or understood. Conquered enemies were removed to Rome, and their captivity consisted in being forced to be Romans, a condition to which they submitted with great reluctance. 'In that period it is not to be doubted that every so- reigner fettling at Rome was welcome to take his place as a Roman citizen in the afilembly of the People; that many were admitted into the Se- nate ', and some even were placed on the throne . It is likely also, that the firit colonies confidered themselves as detached from the city, and as form- ing cantons apart; for we find them, like the
A 2 other x The Claudian family were aliens. 2 TaRquinius Plricus was of Greek extraeion and an alien from Tarquii':;
c H A P. other States of Italy, occasionally at war with the
_. Romans.
But when the sovereignty of Italy came to be eflablifhed at Rome, and was there actually exer- cifed by the collective body of the People, the in- habitants of the colonies, it is probable, laid claim to their votes at elections, and presented themselves to be inrolled in the Tribes. They felt their own consequence and their superiority over the Muni- cipia, or free towns in their neighbourhood, to whom, as a mark of distinction and an act of mu- nificence, some remains of independence had been left. Even in this state, the rolls of the People had been very negligently made up, or preserved. The Kings, the Consuls, the Censors, who were the officers, in different ages of the State, entruift ed with the musters, gave the privilege of citizens to such as presented themselves, or to such as they were pleated to receive on the rolls. One Consul invited all the free inhabitants of Latium to poll in the assemblies of the People; another rejected them, and in time of elections sorbad them the city. But notwithitanding this pro- hibition, aliens who had been brought to Rome even as captives, were suffered by degrees to mix with the citizens'. The inhabitants of the free towns, removing to Rome upon any creditable footing, found easy admission among the mem- bers of some tribe; but from the facility of this admission, the towns complained they were de- populated; and the Senate at last, sensible of the
abuse, x This happened particularly in the cafe of the Campanians;
abuse, endeavoured to shut the gates of their city c H A P. by repeated fcrutinies, and the prohibition of fur- reptitious enrolments: but in vain. The prac- tice still continued, and the growing privilege, dif- tindion, and eminence of a Roman citizen, made that title become the great object of ambition to individuals, and to entire cantons. It had already been extended to diftrids whose inhabitants were not distinguished by any singular merit towards the Roman State. In this refped all the allies were nearly equal; they had regularly composed at least one half in every Roman army, and had borne an equal ihare in all the dangers and trou- bles of the commonwealth; and, from having va- lued themselves of old on their separate titles and national diftindions, they began now to aspire to a ihare in the sovereignty of the empire, and wiih- ed to fink for ever their municipal designations under the general title of Romans.
Not only the great power that was enjoyed in the assembly of the People, and the serious privi- leges that were beflowed by the Porcian law, but even the title of citizen in Italy, of legionary fol- dier in the field, and the permission of wearing the Roman toga or gown, were now ardently coveted as marks of dignity and honour. The city was frequented by persons who hoped separately to be admitted in the Tribes, and by numbers who crowded from the neighbouring cantons, on every remarkable day of assembly, still flattering them- selves, that the expectations which Gracchus had

or public afferhbly, this concourse of aliens, and requiring all the country towns in-Italy to recall their denizens, who had left their own corpora- tions to acd the part of citizens at Rome.
On this occasion, Caius Gracchus, the brother of the late unfortunate Tribune, flood forth, and made one of the firif exhibitions, in which he displayed the extent of his talents, as well as made known the party he was likely to espouse in the commonwealth. Being about twenty years of age when the troubles occasioned by his elder brother had so much disturbed the republic, and ended so fatally for himself, this young man retired upon that cataRtrophd from the public view, and made it uncertain whether the sufferings of his family might not deter him, not only from embracing like dangerous counsels, but even from entering at all on the scene of political affairs. His retire- ment, however, he had employed in such fludies as were then come into repute, on account of their importance, as a preparation for the business of the courts of justice, of the Senate, or the po- pular assemblies; and the firit public appearance he made gave evident proof of the talents he had acquired for there several departments. His parts seemed to be quicker, and his spirit more ardent,
than
than those of his brother Tiberius; and the peo- c H A P.
x. pie conceived hopes of having their pretensions X revived, and more successfully conducted, than they had been under any former leader. The cause of the country towns, in which he now en- gaged, was specious, but as the part he took in it was likely to form a new and a numerous party, prepared for every fadious attempt, and as he professed to make way for the promiscuous ad- mission of strangers on the rolls of the People; a measure which tended so much to distract the republic, to diminish the consequence of those who were already citizens, the argument in fa- vour of the resolution to purge the city of aliens prevailed, and an ad to that purpose now mov- ed in the assembly of the People, accordingly passed .
It deserves to be recorded, that amidst the in- quiries set on foot in consequence of this edict, or about this time, Perperna, the father of a late Consul 2, was claimed by one of the Italian corpo- rations, and found not to have been a citizen of Rome. His son, whom we have already mention- ed, having vanquished and taken Ariftonicus, the pretended heir of Attalus, died in his command at Pergamus; he is accordingly said to have been a rare example of the caprice of fortune, in

The fires of sedition which had sometime prey- ed on the commonwealth, were likely to break out with increasing force upon the promotion of Fulvius Flaccus to the dignity of first magistrate. U. C. 62. This factious citizen had blown up the flame with M. Planitus Hipfus, M.Tiberius Gracchus, and having succeeded him in Fulvius rlaccus. the commission for executing the Agrarian law,
never failed to carry the torch wherever matter of inflammation or general combustion could be found. By his merit with the popular party he had attained his present eminence, and was de- termined to prcferve it by continuing his services. Legcs Ful- He accordingly began the functions of his office by
proposing a law to communicate the freedom of the city to the allies or free inhabitants of Italy; a measure which tended to weaken the power of the Senate, and to increase the numbers of the Peo- ple greatly beyond what could be convened in any one collective body. Having failed in this attempt, he substituted a proposal in appearance more mo- derate, but equally dangerous, That whoever claim- ed the right of citizen, in cafe of being cafi by the Censors, who were the proper judges, might ap- peal to the popular assembly I. This might have conferred the power of naturalization on the lead- ers of faction; and the danger of such a measure,
called x Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. i.
called upon the Senate to exert its authority and c H A P.
x. influence in having this motion also rejeted.
The Consul thus already entered on his popular career, uniting the power of supreme magifirate with that of a commissioner for the execution of the Agrarian law, and likely to break through all the forms which had hitherto retarded or flood in the way of this measure, was with difficulty per- fuaded to call a meeting of the Senate, and to take his place ill that body. The whole, as soon as they were met, joined in representations against there dangerous measures, and in a request that he would withdraw his motions. To there expoitulations he made no reply I; but an occasion soon after- wards offered, by which the Senate was enabled to divert him from these facious pursuits in the city. A deputation arrived from Marseilles, then in alliance with Rome, to request the support of the republic against the Salyii, a neighbouring nation, who had invaded their territories. The Senate gladly embracing this opportunity to find employ- ment abroad for the Confij, decreed a speedy aid to the city of Marseilles, and appointed M. Ful- vius Flaccus to that service. Although this inci- dent marred or interrupted for the present the po- litical designs of the Consul, yet he was induced, by the hopes of a triumph, to accept of the com- mand which offered, and, by his absence, to re- lieve the city for a while from the alarms which he had given.

In this interval some laws are said to have pas- fed refpeding the office and conduct of the Cen- fors. The particulars are not mentioned; but the object probably was, to render the magistrate more circumfpet in the admission of those who claimed to be numbered as citizens. Such at least was like- ly to be the policy of the State in the absence of demagogues, who, by proposing to admit the allies on the rolls of the People, had awakened dange- rous pretensions in every corner of Italy. It soon appeared how seriously these pretensions were adopted by the country towns; for the inhabi- tants already beftirred themselves, and were begin- ning to devise how they might extort by force what they were not likely to obtain with content of the original citizens of Rome. A suspicion ha- ving arisen of such treasonable concerts forming at Fregellke ', the Praetor Opimius had a special com- mission to inquire into the matter, and to proceed as he flould find the occasion required. Having fum- mcncd the chief magistrate of the place to appear before him, he received from this officer, upon a pro- mise of security to his own person, full information of the combinations that had been forming against the government of Rome. So infirucded, the Praztor assembled such a force as was necessary to support

him in afrerting the authority of the State ; and CHA P. thinking it necessary to give a firiking example in x . a matter of so infecious and so dangerous a nature, he ordered the place to be razed to the ground '.
By this ad of severity, the designs of the allies u. c. 6i9.
C. Cassius were for a while suspended, and might have been Longinus,
C. Sextius entirely suppressed, if the fations at Rome had not Calvinus. given them fresh encouragement and hopes of fuc- cess or impunity. This tranfadion was scarcely past, when Caius Gracchus appeared in the city to solicit the office of Tribune; and, by his pretence, revived the hopes of the allies. Having observed, that the Proconsul Aurelius Cotta, under whom he was acting as Proqueftor in Sardinia, instead of being recalled, was continued in his command, and furnished with reinforcements and supplies of every fort as for a service of long duration; and fufpeding, that this measure was pointed against himself, and proceeded from a design to keep him at a distance from the popular assemblies, he quitted his fiation in Sardinia, and returned to Rome without leave. Being called to account by the Censors for de- serting his duty; he defended himself with such ability and force, as greatly raised the expectations which had already been entertained by his party2.
The law, he said, required him only to carry arms ten years, he had adually carried them twelve years; although he might legally have quitted his

X. yet he had remained in it three years. However
willing the Censors might have been to remove this turbulent spirit from the commonwealth, they were too weak to attempt any censure in this slate of his cause, and in the present humour of the People. They endeavoured, in vain, to load him with a share in the plot of Fregella; he till exculpated himself: and, if he had pofiefled every virtue of a citizen, in proportion to his resolution, applica- tion, eloquence, and even severity of manners, he might have been a powerful support to the State. In a speech to the People, on his return from Sar- dinia, he concluded with the following remarkable words: " The purse which I carried full to the "province, I have brought empty back. Others "having cleared the wine casks which they carried
from Italy, bring them back from the provinces " replenished with silver and gold '."
In declaring himself a candidate for the office of Tribune, Caius Gracchus professed his intention to propose many popular ats. The Senators exert- ed all their influence to disappoint his views; but such were the expectations now entertained in Italy, that multitudes crowded to the elecion in greater numbers than could find place in the public square. His partizens handed and reached out their ballots at the windows and over the battlements; but Gracchus, though eleted, was, in consequence

Cornelia, the lifter of one Scipio Africanus, and the mother-in-law of the other, but still better known as the mother of the Gracchi, who, ever since the death of her son Tiberius, lived in re- tirement in Campania, upon hearing of the career which her son, Caius, was likely to run, alarmed at the renewal of a scene which had already occa- iioned her so much sorrow, expoftulated with him on the course he was taking; and, in an unaffect- ed and paflionate address, spoke that ardent zeal for the republic, by which the more refpedable citizens of Rome had been long distinguished.
This high-minded woman, on whom the entire care of her family had devolved by the death of her husband, whilst the children were yet in their infancy, or under age, took care, with unusual at- tention, to have them educated for the rank they were to hold in the State, and did not fail even to excite their ambition. When Tiberius, after the disgrace of Mancinus, appeared to withdraw from the road of preferments and honours, " How " long," she said, " fiall I be distinguished as the "mother-in-law of Scipio, not as the mother of
the Gracchi ?" This latter diflindion, however, ihe came to possess; and it has remained with her name, but from circumstances and events which this refpetable personage by no means appeared to desire. In one fragment of her letters to Caius,
which x Plttarch, Appian, Orofiz, Entrop. Obfcluens-
C I A P. which is fill preserved, " You will tell me," lhe
._' said, " that it is glorious to be rcvenged of our
" enemies. No one thinks so more than I do, if " we can be revenged without hurt to the repub- " lie; but if not, often may our enemies escape. " Long may they be safe, if the good of the com- " monwealth requires their safety." In another letter, which appears to be written after his inten- tion of suing for the Tribunate was declared, fle accosts him to the following purpose: " I take " the gods to witness, that, except the persons " who killed my son Tiberius, no one ever gave " me so much affliction as you now do in this mat- " ter. You, from whom I might have expected "' some consolation in my age, and who, surely, of " all my children, ought to be most careful not to " distress me ! I have not many years to live. Spare " the republic so long for my fake. Shall I never ' fee the madness of my family at an end ? When

gods forbid you flould persist ! if you do, I " fear the course you are taking leads to remorse L' and distraction, which will end only with your " life'."
These remonflrances do not appear to have had any effect. Caius, upon his accession to the Tri-
bunate, x Fragmenta Corn. Nepotis ab Andrea Scotto colle'a, edita cum fcripti' Corn. Nepotis.
bunate, proceeded to fulfil the expedations of his c i . p. party. The Agrarian law, though still in force,. x. had met with continued interruption and delay in the execution. It was even falling into neglet. Caius thought proper, as the first ad of his magi Lex Sem-
pronia agra- firacy, to move a renewal and confirmation of it, ria. with express injunctions, that there should be an annual distribution of land to the poorer citizens x. To this he subjoined, in the firit year of his office, a variety of regulations tending either to increase his own popularity, or to distinguish his admini- Lexfrumen-
taria. firation. Upon his motion, public granaries were erected, and a law was made, that the corn should be issued from thence monthly to the People, two parts in twelve under the prime or original cost 2.
This ad gave a check to industry, which is the befl guardian of manners in populous cities, or wherever multitudes of men are crowded together.
Caius likewise obtained a decree, by which the estates of Attalus, king of Pergamus, lately be- queathed to the Romans, should be let in the man- ner of other lands under the infpedion of the Cen- fors; but the rents, instead of being made part of. the public revenue, should be allotted for the main- tenance of the poorer citizens 3.

c H A P. office of magistracy by the People, was to be deem-
x' .cd for ever disqualificd to serve the republic in any
other station. This aft was intended to operate against Odavius, who, by the influence of Tibe- rius, had been degraded from the office of Tri- bune; and the ad took its title fiom the name of the person against whom it was framed '.
To these were joined, an at to regulate the conditions of the military service2, by which no one was obliged to enter before seventeen years of age, and by which Roman soldiers waere to receive cloathing as well as pay 3; poflibly the firit intro- dudtion of a uniform into the Roman legions: a circumstance which, in modern times, is thought so essential to the character of troops, or the appear- ance of an army.
By the celebrated law of Porcius, which allow- ed of an appeal to the People, every citizen had a remedy against any oppressive sentence or proceed- ing of the executive magistrate; but this did not appear to Gracchus a sufficient restraint on the offi- cers of State. He proposed to have it enacted, that no person, under pain of a capital punish- ment, ihould at all proceed against a citizen with- out a special commission or warrant from the Peo- ple to that effect. And he proposed to give this law a retrofped, in order to comprehend Popilius Laenas 4, who, being Consul in the year after the
troubles x Privilegium in Oclavium. 2 De militum commodis. 3 Plutarch. in C. Graccho.---Lex Sempronia dc libertate civium. 4. Cicer. in Cluentio; pro Rabino; pro domo fua,
troubles occasioned by Tiberius Gracchus, had, CHAP. under the authority of the Senate alone, proceed- ed to try and condemn such as were accefory to that sedition. Laenas perceived the storm that was gathering against him, and chose to avoid it by a voluntary exile. This at was indeed almost an entire abolition of government, and a bar to the most ordinary measures, required for the peace of the commonwealth. A popular fation could withhold every power, which, in their appre- henfion, might be employed against themselves; and in their most pernicious designs had no in- terruption to fear from the Ditator named by the Senate and Consuls, nor from the Consul armed with the authority of the Senate for the fuppref- lion of disorders; a resource to which the repu- blic had frequently owed its preservation. But as we find no change in the administration of justice upon this new regulation, it is probable that the absurdity of the law prevented its effect.
While Gracchus thus proposed to make all the powers of the State depend for their existence on the occasional will of the People, he meant also to render the assemblies of the People themselves more democratical, by Dtripping the higher classes of any prerogative, or influence they might derive from mere precedence, in leading the public decisions. The Centuries being hitherto called to vote in the order of their classes, those of the first or highest class, by voting first, set an example which influ-

were required, in every question, to draw lots for the prerogative, or firit place in the order of vot- ing, and to declare their fuifrage in the place they had drawn.
Under this active Tribune, much public bufi- ness, that used to pass through the Senate, was en- grossed by the popular aifembliest Even in the form of these assemblies, all appearance of refpe&t to the Senate was laid aside. The Rofira, or plat- form on which the presiding magifirate stood, was placed in the middle of an area, of which one part was the market-place, surrounded with stalls and booths for merchandize, and the courts ofjuftice; the other part, called the Comitium, was open to receive the People in their public assemblies; and on one fide of it, fronting the Rofira, or bench of the magistrates, flood the Curia, or Senate-houfe. The People, when any one was speaking, stood partly in the market-place, and partly in the Comitium. The speakers directed their voice to the Comi- tium, so as to be heard in the Senate. This dif- position, Gracchus reverted; and directing his voice to the Forum, or market-place, seemed to dif- place the Senate, and to deprive that body of their office as watchmen and guardians of the public or- der in matters that came before the popular assem- blies 2.

At the time that the Tribune Caius Gracchus cHAP. engaged the minds of his contemporaries, and fur- -. . nifhed hifory chiefly with these effects of his sac- tious and turbulent spirit, it is obfeived, that he himself executed works of general utility; bridges highways, and other public accommodations throughout Italy. That the State having car- ried its arms, for the first time, beyond the mari- time extremity'of the Alps, happily terminated the war with the Salyii, a nation of Gaul, whose territory in the sequel became the first province of Rome in.that country. And that, ill confquence of what passed .in this quarter, Caius Sextius, Consul of the preceding year, was. authorised to place a colony in the neighbourhood of.the hot springs, which, from .his name, were, called the Aque .Sextiae, and are. fill known by a. corruption of the fame appellation .
From Asia, at the fame time, it was reported, that Ariarathes, the king of Cappadocia, and ally ,of the Romans, was murdered, at the instigation of Mithridates, king of Pontus, whose ifter he had married; that the murdered Prince had left a son for whom Mithridates asseted to fecure.the king- dom ; but that the widowed queen having fallen into the hands of Nicomedes, king of Bythinia, this prince, in her right hlad taken possession of -Cappadocia, while Mithridates, in name of his ne- phew, was hastening to remove him from thence. On'this subjet a resolution was adopted in the aflembly of the People at Rome, that both Nico-
B 2 medes z At Aix, in Provence.
C H A P. medes and Mithridates should be required imme-
diately to evacuate Cappadocia, and to withdraw their troops. This resolution Caius Gracchus op- posed with all his eloquence and his credit, char- ging his antagonists aloud with corruption, and a clandestine correspondence with the agents, who, on different fides, were now employed at Rome in soliciting this affair. " None of us," he said, " fland " forth in this place for nothing. Even I, who de-
fire you to put money in your own coffers, and to " consult the interest of the State, mean to be paid,
not with silver or gold indeed, but with your a favour and a good name. They who oppose this " resolution likewise covet, not honours from you, " but money from Nicomedes; and they who sup- *' port it, expea to be paid by Mithridates, not by ' you. As for those who are silent, they, I be- " lieve, understand the market best of all. They "have heard the story of the poet, who being vain "that he had got a great fum of money for re- "hearsing a tragedy, was told by another, that "it was not wonderful he had got so much for "talking, when I, said the other, who it seems " knew more than he was wished to declare, have " got ten times as much for holding my tongue. " There is nothing that a king will buy at so " great a price, on occasion, as silence 1."
Such, at times, was the style in which this po- pular orator was pleased to address his audience. Individuals are won by flattery, the multitude by
buffoonry x A. Gellius, lib. ii, c. io,
buffoonry and satire. From the tendency of this c H A P. speech, it appears to have been the opinion of X- Gracchus, not that the Romans Ihould sequester the kingdom of Cappadocia for the heirs of Ariarathes, but that they should seize it for themselves. The question, however, which now arose relating to the fucceffiom to this kingdom, laid the foundation of a tedious and bloody war, of which the operations and events will occur in their place.

Domitius Ahenobarbus, Gracchus pro- ceeded to offer himself as a candidate to be re- elected into the office of Tribune. In this he fol- lowed the example of his brother Tiberius in a itep, which, being reckoned illegal as well as alarming, was that which hastened his ruin. An attempt had been since made by Papirius Carbo to have the legality of such re-elections acknowledg- ed; but this having failed, Caius Gracchus, with great address, inserted in one of his popular edics, a clause declaring it competent for the People to re-elect a Tribune, in cafe he should need a con- tinuation of his power in order to fulfil his publkc engagements. To avail himself of this clause, he now declared, that his views in behalf of the

and, in. general, the merchants who conduted. the whole trade.of the republic. Though they might be confidered.as neutral. in the disputes of the Senate and People, and therefore impartial where the other orders were biassed, .there was no class of:;men, from their ordinary: habits, more likely to pirpfitute the charader ofjudges for in- terest or actual hire.. This revolution in the courts ofjuftice accordingly may have contributed greatly to haften the approaching corruption of manners, and the disorders of the Itate.

ficers to govern the provinces; and, if it'had been C u A P. firidly observed, might have made some compen- ' fation for the former. The power of naming such officers.was committed to the Senate; and the ar- rangements were to be annually made before the election of Consuls. This continued to be law, but was, often over-ruled by the People .
In the fame year, the boldest and most dange- rous projec ever formed by any popular leader, that of extending the roll of Citizens to all the Italian allies, already attempted by Fulvius Flac- cus, was again renewved by Caius Gracchus; and by the utmost exertion of. the vigilance and au- thority of the Senate, with great difficulty pre- vented.
The rumour of this projea having brought mul- titudes to Rome, the Senate thought it necessary to give the Consuls in charge, that on the day this important question was to come on, they flould clear the city of all firangers, .and not susser any aliens to remain within four miles of the walls. While this business remained in fufpence, Gracchus flattered the poorer citizens with the profped of advantageous settlements, in certain new colonies, of fix thousand men each, which he proposed to plant in the diftrits of Campania and Tarentum, the best cultivated and most opulent parts of Italy, and in colonies, which he likewise proposed to fend abroad into some of the richest provinces.
B 4 Such 2 Florus, lib. iv. c. 13. Sallust. de Bell. Jiugurth. No, 6r,1 Cicero de Provinciis Confularibus.
H AP. Such settlements had been formerly made to oc-
- --cupy and secure some recent conquest abroad;
they were now calculated to serve as allurements to popular favour, and as a provision, made by the leaders of fadion, for their own friends and adherents at Rome.
The Senate, attacked by such popular arts, re- solved to retort on their adversaries; and for this purpose encouraged Marcus Livius, another of the Tribunes, and probably jealous of Gracchus, to take such measures as Ihould, if possible, supplant him in the favour of the People. Livius, according- ly, professing to act in concert with the Senate, pro- posed a number of ads: one to conciliate the minds of the allies, by giving them, while they served in the army, the fame exemption from corporal pu- ex Lvia nifhment, which the Roman citizens had enjoyed. Civium La- Another for the establishment of twelve diffe- tini Nomi- is. rent colonies, each of three thousand citizens. But
what, possibly, had the greatest effea, because it appeared to exceed in munificence all the edits of Gracchus, was an exemption of all those lands, which mhould be distributed in terms of the late Sempronian Law, from all quit-rents and public burdens, which had hitherto, in general, been laid on all porffefions that were held from the public '. It was proposed to name ten commissioners to dif- tribute lands thus unincumbered to the People; and three colonies are mentioned, Syllaceum, Ta- rentum, and Neptunia or Peltum, as having been
aaually j Plutarch. Paulus Minutius de Legibus Romanis.
actually sent abroad in this year, and probably on c H A P. these terms. -
About the fame time it was decreed, that the exRubria. city of Carthage ihould be rebuilt for the recep- tion of a colony of fix thousand Roman citizens. This decree bears the name, not of Sempronius or of Livius, but of Rubrius, another Tribune of the fame year.
The Senate readily agreed to the settlement of these colonies, as likely to divide the popular fa- vour, to carry off a number of the more facious citizens, and to furnish an opportunity likewise of removing from the city, for some time, the po- pular leaders themselves, under pretence of em- ploying them to conduct and to fettle the families destined to form those establishments. According- ly, Caius Gracchus, and Fulvius Flaccus, late Con- ful, and now deeply engaged in all these fadious measures, were destined to take charge of the new colonists, and to superintend their settlement '.
In the mean time, the Senate, in the elecion of oCL.63O Opimius to the ConfulIhip of the following year, pimius, Q.

Max- carried an objet of the highest importance to the imus. reputation and interest of their party, and by the authority of this magistrate, conceived hopes of being able to combat the designs of Gracchus more effectually than they had hitherto done. Opimi- us was accordingly retained in the administration of affairs in Italy, while his colleague, Fabius, was appointed to command in Gaul.

H A p. Caius Gracchus, having the presumption to of-
f er himself a third time candidate for the office of Tribune, was rejeced, and had the mortification to find, that the authority of the Senate began to prevail; and, as they had credit enough to. pro- cure his exclusion from any fliare in the magiitra- cy, so they might 'be able to fruttrate or reverse many of the ads he had obtained in the pursuit or execution of his projects
By the repulse of.Gracchus and his afrociates, the ariftocratical party came to have a majority, even in the college-of Tribunes, Questions oflegif- lation were now likely to be determined in the as- fembly of -the Centuries; and this circumstance alone, while the Senate was able. to retain it, was equivalent to an entire restitution of the arifto- cratical government. The Centuries, under the leading of an active Consul,. were likely to annul former resolutions with the fame decilion and ra- pidity with which they had been passed. Much violence was - expected, and the different parties, recolleting what had happened in the cafe of Ti- berius Gracchus, and careful not to be surprised by their antagonists; for the most part came to 'the place of assembly in bands, even under arms, and endeavoured to poiefs the advantage of the ground as in the presence of an enemy.
Minucius, one of the Tribunes, in consequence of a resolution of the Senate, pretending that he was moved by some unfavourable presages,: pro- ,oifed a repeal or amendment of some of the late
popitlar
popular aCds; .and particularly, .to change the def- c u A P.
X. tination:of.the cpolny intended for Carthage, to x. some .other place.. This motion, was firenuoufly opposed ,by Fulvius IFlaccus, and by Caius Grac- chus, who treatqd.the reportof presages from As- rica as a, mere fi.iqn, and the whole design as pro- ceeding, -froi'm the inveterate :hatred ,of the Nobles to the Peopie. , Before the affemblymet, in which this question. was to be decided,. the popular lead- ers.. attemp.ted to., ffeiztei .the Capitol, bu.t, found themnfelves prevented by: the Gonful, who had .al- ready, with an armed force, secured that station.:
In the morning after they had.received this dif- appointment, the. People being assembled, and the Consul being employed in offering up the cufto. mary sacrifices, Graschus, with his party, came to their place, in the ;Comitium. One of the.atten- dants of. the .Consul, who was removing the en- trails of a; viCtim, reproached Gracchus, as .he pafled, with sedition, and in the petulance of a retainer to power, bid him desist from his machi- nations against the government of the common- wealth. On this provocation, one of the party of Gracchus struck the offende.r .with.,-his dagger,; and killed himl on the spot. The cry of murder ran through the multitude, and the assembly began to break up. Gracchus endeavoured to speak, but could not.be heard for the tumult; and all thoughts of business were laid aside. The Consul imme- diately summoned the Senate to meet; and hav- ing reported a murder committed in the place of
affemnbly,
CHAP. assembly, and what appeared to him the firif
v--: adt of hostility in a war, which the popular sac-
tion had prepared against the State, he received the charge that was usual on perilous occasions, to provide, in the manner which his own pru- dence ihould direc, for the safety of the com- monwealth. Thus authorised, he commanded the Senators and the Knights to arm, and made pro- per dispositions to secure the principal streets. Being master of the Capitol and Forum, he ad- journed the assembly of the People to the usual' place on the following day, and cited the persons accused of the murder that was recently commit- ted, to answer for the crime which was laid to their charge.
In consequence of this adjournment, and the Gonful's instructions, numbers in arms repaired to the Comitium at the hour of aflembly, and were ready to execute such orders as they might receive for the public safety. Gracchus and Fulvius re- fused to obey the citation they had received, and the Capitol being secured against them, they took post, with a numerous party in arms, on the Aventine Hill, which was opposite to the Capitol, and from which, though more distant, they equal- ly looked down on the Circus, the Forum and the place of assembly.
Being again cited to appear at the Tribunal of the Roman People, they sent a young man, one of the sons of Fulvius, to capitulate with the Consul, and to fettle the terms on which they should de- scend from their strong-hold. To this meflage
they
they were told, in return, that they must answer c H A P.
x. at the bar of the aflembly, as criminals, not pre- tend to negociate with the republic, as equals; that no party, however numerous, was entitled to parley with the People of Rome: and to this an- fwer the meflenger was forbidden, at his peril, to bring any reply. The party, however, frill hoped to gain time, or to divide their enemies; and they ventured to employ young Fulvius again to repeat their message. He was seized by the Consul's or- der. Gracchus and Fulvius, with their adherents, were declared public enemies; and a reward was offered to the person who should kill or secure them. They were infiantly attacked, and, after a little refitance, forced from their ground. Grac- chus fled by the wooden bridge to the opposite ide of the Tiber, and was there slain, .either by his own hand, or by that of a faithful servant, who had undertaken the talk of thus saving him in his last extremity from falling into the power of his ene- mies. Fulvius was dragged to execution from a bath where he attempted to conceal himself. The heads of both were carried to the Consul, and ex. changed for the promised reward.
In this fray the party of the Senate, being re- gularly armed and prepared for slaughter, cut off the adherents of Caius Gracchus and Fulvius in greater numbers than they had done those of Ti- berius; they killed about three thousand two hundred and fifty in the streets, and confined great numbers, who were afterwards firangled in the prisons. The bodies of the slain, as the law
ordained,
c H A P. ordained, in the cafes of treason, being denied the
X. forms of a funeral, were cast into the giver, and
their estates confiscated .
The house of Fulvius was rafed, and the ground on which it flood was-laid open for public uses; from these beginnings, it appeared that the Ro- mans, who, in the pursuit of their, foreign con- quests, had so liberally shed the blood of other nations, might become equally lavish of their own-

T HE popular party had,. in the late tumults, cH A P.
carried their violence to such extremes, as _vI disgusted and alarmed every person who had any desire of domestic peace; and in their ill-advifed recourse to arms, but too well juflified the mea- fures which had been taken againit them. By this exertion of vigour, the Senate, and ordinary ma-, giftrates, recovered their former authority; affairs returned to their usual channel, and the most per- feet order seemed to arise from the late confusions.
ueftions of legislation were allowed to take their rife in the Senate, and were not carried to the Peo- ple, without the fandion of the Senate's authority. The legislative power was excrcifcd in the assem- bly of the Centuries, and the prohibitory or de- fenfive function of the Tribunes, or representatives of the People, without ltopping the proceedings of
government,
c HA P. government, or substituting a democratical ufur-
xi. pation, was such as to check the abuses of execu-
tive power in the hands of the aristocracy. Even the judicative power, veiled in the Equestrian or- der, promised to have a salutary effect, by holding a balance between the different ranks and distinct- ions of men in the republic.
Meanwhile the ariflocratical party, notwith- standing the ascendant they had recently gained, did not attempt to rescind any of the regular in- ftitutions of Gracchus; they were contented with inflicting punishments on those who had been ac- ceffory to the late sedition, and with re-eftabliih- ing such of the nobles as had suffered by the vio. lence of the popular faction. Popilius Laenas, driven into exile by one of the edits of Gracchus, or by the persecution to which it exposed him, was now recalled upon the motion of Calpurnius Pifo one of the Tribunes . u. c. 633. As the state of parties was in some measure re-
UbuiS, versed, Papirius Carbo, who wished to be of the ard C. Pa. winning fide, thought proper to withdraw from bo. that he had espoused; and, by the credit of those
now in possession of the government, was promoted to the station of Consul, and yielded the first fruits of his conversion by defending the cause of his predecessor Opimius, who, at the expiration of his Consulate, was brought to trial for having put Roman citizens to death without the forms of law. Carbo, though himself conneted with those who
suffered x Cicero in Bruto.
suffered in that inflance, now pleaded the juflice c H . p.
xi. and necessity of the late military executions ; and, a upon this plea, obtained the acquittal of his client.
This merit on the part of Carbo, however, did not so far cancel his former offences as to prevent his being himself tried and condemned in the fol- lowing year, as an accomplice in the sedition of Gracchus. He was supposed to have been accessary to the murder of Scipio; and his cause not being warmly espoused by any party, he fell a sacrifice to the imputation of this heinous crime. It is said, that upon hearing his sentence pronounced, he killed himself1.
Odavius, one of the Tribunes of the present Lex o-a-
via SI1- year, moved an amendment of the law obtained mentaria. by Gracchus, refpeding the distribution of corn from the public granaries, probably to ease the treasury in part of that burden; but the particu- lars are unknown.
About this time appeared in the assemblies of the People the celebrated Caius Marius. Born of ob- fcure parents in the town of Arpinum, on the Liris 2, and formed amidst the occupations of a peasant 3, and the hardlhips of a legionary soldier, of rustic manners, but ofa resolute spirit, and eager ambition. Without any other apparent title than that of being a denifon of Rome, he now laid claim to the honours

c H A P. bs the state. He is remarkable for having suffered ,. _ * more repulses in his first attempts to be eleted in-
to office, and for having succeeded more frequent- ly afterwards, than any other Roman citizen during the existence of the commonwealth.
Marius, after being disappointed in his first can- vas for the office of Tribune. succeeded in the fol- lowing year. The ads which were pafled under his Tribunate, and which bear his name, do not Lex Maria carry any violent expressions of party spirit, nor gis. give intimation of that insatiate ambition with
which he afterwards distressed his country; the first related to the conduct of elections, and pro- vided some remedy for an evil which was com- plained of in the manner of soliciting votes. The space between the rails, by which the citizens pafled to give in their ballots, was so broad as to admit, not only those who came to vote, but the candidates also, with their adherents and friends, who came to importune and to overawe the People in the very a& of giving their suffrage. Marius proposed to put an end to this practice, and to provide for the entire uninfluenced freedom of election, by narrowing the entrance, so that on- ly the voters could pass. A party of the Nobles, with Aurelius Cotta the Consul at their head, not knowing with what a resolute spirit they were a .out to contend, being averse to this reformation, prevailed on the Senate to withhold its aflent, without lihich any regu!lnr quefion on this sub- .et couldl not be put to the People. But Marius,
in the character of Tribune, threatened the Con- c H A P. ful with immediate imprisonment, if he did not v'_ move the Senate to recall its vote. The matter being reconsidered, Lucius Metellus, who was first on the Rolls, having given his voice for affirming the flrft decree, was ordered byl Marius into cufio- dy; and there being no Tribune to intercede fbr him, must have gone to prison, if the dispute had not terminated by the majority agreeing to have the matter carried to the People, as Marius propo- fed, with the fandcion of the Senate's authority.
In another of the ads of Marius the republic was frill more indebted to his wisdom and cou- .rage, in withflanding an attempt of one of his .colleagues to flatter the indigent citizens at the ex- pence of the public treasury, by lowering the terms on which corn, in pursuance of an order rc- -cently obtained by Ocdavius, was distributed from the granaries. This was an ordinary expedient of 'Tribunitian faction. Marius opposed it as of dan- gerous consequence. And his conduct in this mat- ter marked him out as one not to be awed by cla- mour, and a person, who, into whatever party he ihould be admitted, was destined to govern. The times indeed were likely to give more importance to his character as a soldier than as a citizen; and in that he was fill farther raised above the cen- sure of those who were inclined to revile or un- dervalue what were called his upstart preten- Sions '.
C 7 From r Pintar':h, in Mario.
c H A P. Fromi the time that the Romans first paired into
x .. the Transalpine Gaul, as auxiliaries to the repub-
lic of Marseilles, they had maintained in that neigh- bourhood a certain military establishment; and, by planting colonies at convenient stations, ihewed their intention of retaining possessions on that fide of the Alps. Betultus, or Betultich, a prince of the country, who was supposed to have a force at command of two hundred thousand men, attempt- ed to expel these intruders, but was defeated, first by the Proconsul Fabius, afterwards by Domitius Ahenobarbus, who found in their conflicts with this enemy the occasion of their refpetive tri- umphs. This prince himself became a captive to Domitius, and was carried to Rome, where he was led in procession, diflinguiflied by his paint- ed arms and his chariot of silver, the equipage in which it was said he usually led his army to battle I. . c. 633. It appears that the Romans had availed them-
selves of their pofieffions in Africa, to be supplied with elephants from thence, and these they em- ployed in the first wars they made in Gaul; for the vitory of Domitius is attributed to the effec that was produced by these animals .
Quintus Marcius succeeded Domitius in the command of the troops which were employed in Gaul, and continued to gain ground on the na-
tives, I Vc!ccius Pater. Animianus Marcel!. l . fine. Pxf dian.us in Verri r.im Secun;.a: Val. Max. lib. v. c. p,
tives, who took arms from different cantons fuc- c H A P. ceffively againit him. He planted a colony at Xl. Narbo, to strengthen the frontier of the newly- acquired province on one fide; and, as the Ro- mans had hitherto always passed by sea into that country, he endeavoured to open a palfage by the Alps, in order to have a communication by land with Italy on the other. In the course of there operations the Steni, an Alpine nation that ob- flruaed his march, was entirely cut off.
About this time the Roman generals obtained their triumphs on different quarters, in the Bali- ares and in Dalmatia, as well as in Gaul; and the republic did not meet for some years with an ene- my able to resist her power, except on the fide of Thrace and the Ifter or Danube, where a Pro- consul of the name of Cato was defeated; and where a refitance was for some years kept up by the natives.
But of the foreign affairs which now occupied the attention of the Romans, the molt memorable was that which arose from the contest of pretenders to the crown of Numidia, which, by the death of Micipfa, the son and successor of Massinissa, came to be disposed of about this time. The late king had two sons, Adherbal and Hiempfal. He had likewise adopted Jugurtha, the natural son of his brother Manaflabal, whom he had employed at the head of his armies, thinking it safer to gain him by good offices, than to provoke him by a total exclusion from favour. This monarch had formed a pro-
C3 jed,
c II .A P. jCe, fr. quent in barbarous times, but always ru-
, minous, to divide his territories; and he hoped
that, while he provided for his own sons, he ifhould lecure to them, from motives of grati- tude, the protection and good offices of Jugurtha, whom he admitted to an equal share with them in the partition of his kingdom. The confequen- ces of this mistaken arrangement soon appeared in the diftracions that followed, and which arose from the ambition of Jugurtha, who, not content with his part of the kingdom, aspired to make himself master of the whole. For this purpose he formed a secret design against the lives of both the brothers, of whom the younger, Hiempfal, fell into a snare, which was laid for him, and was killed. Ad- herbal, being more cautious, obliged his crafty ene- my to declare himself openly, took the field againit him with all the forces he could raise, but was de- feated, and obliged to take refuge in the Roman province, and from thence thought proper to pass into Italy, in order to lay his complaints before the Senate and People of Rome.
Maflinifa, the grandfather of this injured prince, had given etfectual aid to the Romans in their wars with Carthage; and, upon the final reduc- tion of that republic, was rewarded with a con- iiderable part of its spoils. From this time for- ward the Romans expeced, and the kings of Nu- midia actually paid to them, a deference in the manner of a vassal or tributary prince to his so- vereign lord. Upon the faith of this connection
with-
with Rome, Adherbal now carried his complaints c HAP . to that city; and Jugurtha, knowing how ready . the Romans were, in the characer of arbitrators, to confider themselves as the sovereign among nations, thought proper to fend a deputation oi his own part, to counteract the representations of his rival.
This crafty Numidian had served under Scipio at the siege of Numantia, where he had an oppor- tunity of observing the manners and discipline of the Romans, and accommodated hinrfelf to both. He was equally diftinguiihed by his implicit sub- mission to command, as by his impetuous courage, and by the ability of his conduat in every emergence. He had even then probably directed his views to the succession which was likely to fall into weak or incapable hands, and saw of what consequence the Romans might prove in deciding his fortunes. He had studied their character, and had already marked out the line he was to follow in conduc- ting his affairs with them. They appeared to be a number of sovereigns aflembled together, able in council and formidable in the field; but, in comparison to the Africans in general, open, un- designing and simple. With the pride of monarchs they began, he imagined, to feel the indigence of courtiers, and were to be moved by considerations of interest rather than force. His commissioners were now accordingly furnished with ample pre- sents, and with the means of gratifying the prin- cipal persons at Rome in a manner that was suited
C 4 to
c H A P. to their respective ranks and to their influence in
XI. the itate.
In the choice of this plan Jugurtha, like most politicians that iefine too much, had formed a system with great ingenuity, and spoke of it with a specious wit; but had not taken into his ac- count the whole circumitances of the cafe in which he engaged. Rome, he used to fay, was a city to be fold. But he forgot that, though many Ro- mans could be bought, no treasure was sufficient to buy the republic; that to buy a few, made it necefiary for him to buy many more; that as he raised expectations, the number of expetants in- creased without limit; that the more he gave, the more he was still expected to give; that in a state which was broke into factions, if he gained one par- ty by his gifts, that alone would be sufficient to rouse up another against him. And accordingly, after lavishing his money to influence the councils of Rome, he was obliged to have recourse to arms at last, and to contend with the forces of the re- public, after he had exhausted his own treasure in attempting to corrupt her virtue.
Although this adventurer had his abettors at Rome, such was the injuitice of his cause, or the sus- picion of treachery in those who espoused it, that they durst not openly avow their intentions. They endeavoured to suspend the resolutions which were in agitation against him, and had the matter re- ferred to ten commissioners who should go into Africa, and in pretence of the parties fettle the

XI. indeed he was supposed to have praftifed his art '---. on the Roman commissioners with better success than he had experienced with the Senate and People. He prevailed upon these commissioners to agree to a partition of the kingdom, and to fa- vour him in the lot which ihould be assigned to himself: knowing that force must ultimately de- cide every controversy which might arise on the subjec, he made choice, not of the richeit, but of the most warlike division; and indeed had al- ready determined that, as soon as the Romans were gone from Africa, he ihould make an end of the contest by the death of Adherbal; trusting that, by continuing to use the specific which it was said he had already applied, he might pre- vail on the Romans to overlook what they would not, on a previous request, have permitted.
He accordingly, soon after the departure of the Roman commissioners, marched into the territo- ries of Adherbal, ihut him up in the town of Cirta; and, while the Romans sent him repeated meflages to desist, still continued the blockade, until the mercenaries of Adherbal, tired of the hardships they were made to endure, advised, and, by their appearing ready to desert, forced him to commit himself to the mercy of Jugurtha, by whom he was immediately slain.
By these events, in about seven years from the death of Micipfa, Jugurtha attained the object which lie had so long defred ; but the arts which
procured
c H A P. procured him a crown, likewise rendered his slate
I. _ insecure. He was disappointed in his expectation
to pacify the Romans. The money he dealt went into the pockets only of a few, but his crimes rou- fed the indignation of the whole People. Prac- tifed statesmen or politicians are seldom directed in their conduct by mere feelings of injustice re- speding wrongs of a private nature. They have, or affect to have, reasons of state to set the confi- deration of individuals aside. The greater part of the Roman Senate accordingly, whether ating on maxims of policy, or, according to the scandal of the times, won by the presents of Jugurtha, received the complaints which were lodged against him with indifference; but the aflembly of the People, moved by the cries of perfidy and murder which were raised by the Tribunes, received the representations of his conduct with indignation and rage. Theef passions were inflamed by op- position to the Nobles, who were supposed to fa- vour the murderer. Neither the moit deliberate Statesman nor the most determined partizan of Jugurtha durst appear in his cause, nor propose to decline a war with that prince, although it was likely to be attended with considerable difficulties; and was to be undertaken at a time when a cloud hung over Italy itself on the fide of Gaul, a quar- ter from which the Italians always expected, and often experienced, the most terrible storms. u' . 6.7. About the time that Adherbal laid his com-
plaints againa Jugurtha before the Senate of Rome,
a
a new enemy had appeared. The north of En- c HAP. rope, or of Asia, had cast off a swarm of its peo- X pie, which, spreading to the south and to the weft, was first descried by the Romans on the frontier of Illyricum, and presently drew their attention to that fide. The horde thus in motion was said to consist of three hundred thousand fighting men, accompanied by their families of women and child- ren, and covering the plains with their cattle. The Consul Papirius Carbo was ordered to take post in Illyricum, to observe the motions of this tremendous host. Alarmed by their teeming to point towards the diftria of Aquileia, he put him- self, with too little precaution, in their way; and, unable to withstand their numbers, was overwhelm- ed as by a tempest.
This migrating nation the Romans have called by the name of Cimbri, without determining from whence they came. It is said that their cavalry amounted to no more than fifteen thousand; that it was their practice to despise horses, as well as the other spoils of an enemy, which they ge- nerally destroycd: and from this circumstance it may be argued, that they were not of Scythian extraction, nor sprung from those mighty plains in the northern parts of Alia, where military force has from time immemorial consisted of ca- valry, and where the animal they mounted was valued above every other fpecics of acquisition or property; and that they mult have been bred rather amongst mountains and woods, where the horse is not of equal service. On their hel-
mets,
CH AP. mets, which were crested with plumes, they car.
X _t ried the gaping jaws of wild beasts. On their
bodies they wore breast-plates of iron, had ihields painted of a conspicuous colour; and carried two miflile javelins or darts, and a heavy sword. They collected their fighting men, for the most part, into a solid column, equally extending eve- ry way: in one of their battles, it was report- ed, that the fides of this square extended thir- ty fladia, or between three and four miles. The men of the foremolt ranks were fattened toge- ther with chains locked to their girdles, which made them impenetrable to every attack, and gave them the force of a torrent, in fwveeping ob- firucions before them. Such were the accounts, whether well or ill founded, with which the Ro- mans were alarmed on the approach of this tre- mendous enemy.
Although, by the defeat of Carbo, Italy lay open to their devastations, yet they turned away to the north and to the westward, and keeping the Alps on their left; made their appearance again in the neighbourhood of Narbonne, or province of Transalpine Gaul, and from thence palled over the Pyrenees, alarming the Roman settlements in Spain, and keeping Rome itself in fufpence, by the uncertainty of the track they might afterwards choose to pursue. U. C. 642. Such was the slate of affairs, when the popular Pub. Cor- nelius, Sci- cry and generous indignation of the Roman Peo- pio aftica. L. ulpur- pie forced the State into a war with Jugurtha. nius, Pifo, eeftia. The
The necessary levies and supplies for this ser- CH AP. vice were ordered. The Consul Pifo was delti-- ned to command, and Jugurtha could no longer doubt that the force of the Roman republic was to be employed against himself; yet in hopes to avert the storm, and relying on the arts he had formerly praaifed, which were said to consist in the distribution of presents and money, he sent his own son, with two proper assistants, in quality of ambassadors to Rome. As soon as their arrival was announced to the Senate, a resolution of this body pased, that unless they brought an offer from Jugurtlha to surrender his person and his kingdom at discretion, they ihould be required in ten days to be gone from Italy.
This resolution being made known to the son of Jugurtha, he presently withdrew, and was soon followed by a Roman army, which had been al- ready prepared to embark for Africa. The war was conduced at first with great vivacity and success: but Jugurtha, by offering great public concessions or private gratifications, prevailed on the Consul to negociate. It was agreed, that, upon receiving a proper hostage on the part of the Romans, the king himself fllould repair to their camp, in order to conclude the treaty. In the ar- ticles which were made public, the king agreed to surrender himself at discretion, and to pay a large contribution in horses, corn, elephants, and money; but in secret articles, which were drawn up at the fame time, the Consul engaged that the person of
the
CHAP. the king should be safe, and that the kingdom of _. _Numidia should be secured to him.
During these tranfadions the time of the ex- piration of Pifo's command drew near, and he himself was called into Italy to preside at the ap- proaching eletions. His report of the treaty with Jugurtha was received with suspicion, and the cry of corruption resumed by the popular party.
Where is this captive ?" said the Tribune Mem- mius; " if he have surrendered himself, he will
obey your commands; fend for him; queflion " him in refpeat to what is pail. If he refuse to ^' come, we shall know what to think of a treaty ' which brings impunity to Jurgurtha, princely <' fortunes to a few private persons, mortification
and infamy to the Roman republic." Upon this motion the Prator Cassius Longinus, a person of approved merit and unihaken integrity, was haRtened into Africa, with positive inftrudions to bring the king of Numidia to Rome. By the safe conduct which Caflus brought on the part of the republic, and by his own assurances of pro- tection, Jugurtha was prevailed on to commit him- self to the faith of the Romans. He accordingly laid aside his kingly fiate, dismissed his attendants, and set out for Italy, determined to appear as a suppliant at Rome. Upon his arrival, being call- ed into the public assembly, Memmius proposed to interrogate him on the subject of his supposed izcrct transaction with certain members of the Se- nate ; but here Bebius, another of the Tribunes,
interposed
interposed his negative; and, notwithitanding that c H A P. the People exclaimed, and even menaced, this XL Tribune persisted. And before this obftru&ion to the further examination of Jugurtha could be re- moved, an incident took place, which occasioned his sudden departure from Italy.
Maffiva, the son of Guluffa, being the grandson and natural representative of Massinissa, and the only person beside Jugurtha who remained of the royal line of Numidia, had been persuaded by AI- binus, the Consul eleted for the ensuing year, to fRate his own pretensions before the Roman Senate, and to lay claim to the crown. Jugurtha, though at Rome, and in the power of those who were likely to resent any insult that was offered to their govern- ment, gave a specimen of the bold and sanguinary counsels to which he was inclined, employing against his competitor the ordinary arts of an African court, had him aflaffinated. The crime was traced to its author, but the safe conduct he had received could not be violated; and he was only commanded, without delay to depart from Italy. On this oc- cafion he left Rome with that memorable faying; " Here is a city to be fold, if any buyer can be " found."
The Consul Albinus soon followed Jugurtha, to u. c. 643.

from whose apparent conduct no judgment could be formed of his real designs. This artful war- rior often advanced with a seeming intention to hazard a battle, when he was molt resolved to decline it; or he himself precipitantly fled, when his design was to rally and take advantage of any disorder his enemy might incur in a too eager pursuit. His offers of submission, or his threats, were equally fallacious; and he used, perhaps in common with other African princes, means to mislead his antagonist, which Europeans, antient as well as modern, have in general condemned. He made solemn capitulations and treaties with a view to break them, and confidered breach of faith no more than a feint or an ambufl, as a Itra- tagem licensed in war. The Europeans have al- ways termed it perfidy to violate the faith of a trea- ty, the Africans held it flupidity to be caught in the inare.
By the artifices of Jugurtha accordingly, or by the remissness ofthofe who were opposed to him, the war was protracted for another year, and the Con- ful, as the time of election drew near, was recalled, as usual, to preside in the choice of his successor. At his arrival the city was in great agitation. The cry of corruption, which had been raised against many of the Nobles, on account of their supposed correspondence with Jugurtha, gave an advantage to the popular party, and they deter-

mined to improve it, by raising prosecutions to CHA P. the ruin of persons, either odious to the People, or obnoxious to the Equestrian order, who then had the power of judicature in their hands . Three inquisitors were accordingly named by special commifion to take cognizance of all complaints of corruption that should be brought before them; and this commission was instantly employed to harass the Nobility, and to revenge the blood which had been fled in the late popular tumults. Lucius Calpurnius Pifo, Beftia, C. Cato, Spurius Albinus, and L. Opimius, all of consular dignity, fell a sacrifice on this occasion to the popular re- fentment. The Tribune Mamilius, upon whose motion this tribunal had been erected, with his associates, apprehending that, upon the expiration of their trust, the heat of the prosecutions might abate, moved the People that they might be con- tinued in their office; and, upon finding them- selves opposed by the influence of the Senate and the ordinary magistrates, they suspended, by vir- tue of their tribunitian prerogative, the election of Consuls, and for a whole year kept the republic in a fiate of absolute anarchy.
In this interval Aulus Albinus, who had been left by his brother, the late Consul, in the com- mand of the army in Africa, determined to im- prove the occasion by some memorable action. He left his quarters in the winter, and marched far into the country, hoping that by force or fur-

XI. __e., treasures and military stores. Jugurtha encouraged
him in this design, affected fear, retired with pre- cipitation wherever the Romans presented them- selves; and, to increase the presumption of their general, sent frequent meifages to implore his pity.
He at the fame time endeavoured to open a correspondence with Thracians and other irregu- lars, by whom the Roman army was attended. Some of these he corrupted; and, when he had drawn his enemy into a difficult fituatioi, and pre- pared his plan for execution, he suddenly advan- ced in the night; and the avenues to the Roman fiation being occupied, as he expeCted, by the Thracians and Ligurians whom he had corrupted, and by whom he was suffered to pass, he surprised the legions in their camp, and drove them from thence in great confusion to a neighbouring height, where they enjoyed during the night, some respite from the attacks of the enemy; but without any resource for fubtiftence, or hopes of recovering their baggage.
In the morning Jugurtha desired to confer with the Praetor; and representing how much the Ro- mans, deprived of their provision and equipage, were then in his power, made a merit of offering them quarter, on condition that they would con- elude a treaty of peace, and in ten days evacuate h!is kingdom.
These terms were accordingly accepted: but the capitulation, when known at Rome, gave oc-
cafion
cafion to much indignation and clamour. It was c H A P.
XI. voted by the Senate not to be binding, and the ' .Consul Albinus,,in order to repair the loss of the Public, and to restore the credit of his own fa- mily, made hasty levies, with which he proposed to renew the war in Numidia. But not having the consent of the Tribunes to this measure, he was obliged to leave his forces behind him in Italy, and joined the army in person without being able to bring any reinforcement. He found it in no condition to face the enemy, and was content- ed to remain inative until a successor fiould be named in the province.
Resentment of the disgraces incurred in Numi- u. c. 644. dia, and fear of iinvafion from the Cimbri, who, Meteills having traversed Spain and Gaul, were still .on' 'jdunicus. their march, appear to have calmed for a littlesilanus. time the animosity of domestic factions at Rome. The consular eletions were suffered to praceed.; and the choice of the People falling on Quintus Cecilius Metellus and M. Junius Silanus, the first was appointed to the command of the army in Numidia, the second to observe the motions of the Cimbri on the frontiers of Gaul, and to turn them aside, if possible, from the territory of Rome. About this time those wandering nations had sent a formal merfage to the Romans, desiring to have it underfood on what lands they might fettle ', or rather, over what lands they might pass in mi- gration with their families and herds. No return

by force, overcame in battle the Consul Silanus, *and, probably without intending, to. retain any conquest, passed on their way wherever the asped of the country tempted their choice, .
Metellus proceeded to Africa with a confider- :able reinforcement; and, having spent some time ·in restoring the discipline of the army, which had been greatly neglected, and in training. his new levies to the duties and hardships of the service, he direced .his march to the.enemy's country, and in his way had frequent meflages from the king of Numidia, with profeflions of submission and of a pacific disposition: So much, that when the Roman army entered on the territory of this prince, they found the country every where pre- pared to receive them in a friendly manner; the people in tranquillity, the gates of every city left open, and the markets ready to supply them with necelfaries.
These appearances, with the known charader of Jugurtha, creating distrust, only excited the vigilance of Metellus. They even provoked him to retort on the Numidian his own infiduous arts. He accordingly tampered with Bomilcar and the other messengers of Jugurtha to betray their maf- ter, and promised them great rewards if they would deliver this offender into the hands of the Romans '-ither living or dead.
Jugurtha, not confidering that his known cha-
raeter
Pacer for fallehood must have destroyed the cre- c H A iP dit of all his own professions, even if he should at. X any time think proper to make them sincere, and trusting to the effet of his submissive metfages in rendering the enemy secure, made a disposition to profit by any errors they should commit, and hop- ed to circumvent and destroy them on their march. For this purpose he waited for them on the de- scents of a high mountain, over which they were to pais in their way to the Muthul, a river which helped to form the situation of which. he was to- avail himself. He accordingly lay concealed by its banks until 'the enemy actually fell in to the snare he had laid for them. And although the effect was not answerable to his hopes, he main- tained, during the greater part of a day, with the advantage of ground and of numbers, a con- test with troops who possesed, against his irregu- lars, a great superiority of order, discipline, and courage ; but not .having found the Romans, as he expected, in any degree off their guard, he was in the event of that day's action, obliged to de- part with a few horse to a remote or interior part of his kingdom.
This victory obtained over Jugurtha, appeared to be an end of the war. His army was dispersed, and he was left with a few horsemen, who at- tended his person, to find a place of retreat, or to chute a new station at which to re-assemble his forces, if he meant to continue the wiar.
The Numidians were inured to action. The frequent wars of that continent, the wild and un-
D 3 fettled
c I . P. fettled fiate of their own country, made the use of
, horses and of arms familiar to them: but so void
was the nation of military policy, and its- people so unaccufftomed to any permanent order, that it was scarcely possible for the king to fight two bat- tles with the fame army. If vicorious, they with- drew with their plunder; if defeated, they fuppo- fed all military obligations at an end: and in either cafe, after an ation, every one fled where he ex- pected to be soonest in safety, or most at liberty to avail himself of the spoil he had gained.
Metellus, after the late engagement, finding no- enemy in the field, was for some time uncertain to what part of the kingdom Jugurtha had directed his flight. But having intelligence that he was in a new situation assembling an army, and likely to form one frill more numerous than any he had- yet brought into the field, tired of pursuing an enemy on whom defeats had so little effect, he turned away to the richer and more cultivated- parts of the kingdom.. Here the plunder of the country might better repay his labour, and the king, if he ventured to defend his own territory, might more sensibly feel his defeats. Jugurtha perceiving this intention of the Roman general, drew the forces he had assembled towards the fame quarter, and soon appeared in his rear.
While Metellus was endeavouring to force the city of Zama, Jugurtha assaulted his carfip, and, though repulsed from thence, took a post, by which he made the situation of the Romans, between
the
the town on one fide, and the Numidian army on c H A P
Xi. the other, so uneasy, as to oblige them to raise the x siege.
This the Numidian prince thought a proper op- portunity to gain some credit to his pacific pro- feffiohs. He made an offer accordingly to fur- render at discretion, and actually delivered up great part of his arms and military stores; but this purpose, if ever sincere, he soon retra&ed, and again had recourse to arms.

'I'he pos,;Macu9 troops he had posted in Vacca being cut off by the Scaurus. inhabitants, he made hasty marches in the night, surprised the place, and, without having allowed- the authors of that outrage more than two days to enjoy the fruits of their perfidy, amply revenged the wrong they had done to the Roman garrison.
But the success of Metellus did not haften the ruin of Jugurtha so much as his own mifcondud, in the jealous and sanguinary measures which he now took to suppress plots and conspiracies either real or supposed to be formed against his life, by persons the molf in his confidence.
Bomilcar, still carrying in his mind the offers which had been made to him by Metellus, and willing to have some merit with the Romans, into whose hands he and all the fubjedts of Jugurtha were likely soon to fall, formed a design against
D 4 his
c H A P. his master, and drew Nabdalfa, a principal officer
in the Numidian armies, to take part in the plot. They were discovered in time to prevent the ex- ecution of their design, but they made Jugurtha from thenceforward confider the camp of his own army as a place of danger to himself, render- ed him distrustful, timorous, and unquiet; fre- quently changing his company and his quarters, his guards and his bed. Under there apprehlen- lions, by which his mind was considerably difor- dered and weakened, he. endeavoured, by con- tinual and rapid motions, to make it uncertain where he should be found; and he experienced at last, that private assassination and breach of faith, although they appear to abridge the toils of ambition, are not expedient even in war; that they render human life itself, for the advantages of which war is undertaken, no longer eligible or worthy of being preserved. Weary of his anxious itate, he ventured once more to face Metellus in the field, and being again defeated, fled to Thala, where he had left his children and the most va- luable part of his treafurc. This city too, finding Metellus had followed him, he was obliged to abandon, and, with his children and his remain- ing effects, fled from Numidia, firit to the coun- try of the Getuli, barbarous nations, that lived among the mountains of Atlas, south of Numidia, and whom he endeavoured to arm in his cause. From thence he fled to Bocchus king of Mauri- tania, whose daughter he had married; and hav-
ing
ing persuaded this prince to confider his quarrel c H AP.
XI. with the Romans as the common cause of all mo- X. narchies, who were likely in succession to become the prey of this arrogant and-infatiable Power, he prevailed on the king of Mauritania to assemble an army, and to attempt the relief of Numidia.
Jugurtha, in conjunction with his new ally, di- rected his march to Cirta, and the Roman general perceiving his intention, took post to cover that place. But while he was endeavouring, by threats or persuasions, to detach.the king of Mauritania from Jugurtha, .he received information from Rome, that he himself was superseded in the com- mand of the army; and from thenceforward, un- der pretence of meflages and. negotiations that were paffing.between the parties, protracted the war, and possibly inclined to leave it with all its difficulties entire, to his successor. His dismission was the more. galling to himself, that it was ob- tained. in favour of Caius Marius, who, having served under him in this war, had with. great dif- ficulty,..and not without some expression of.ecorn on the part of his general, obtained leave to de- part for Rome, where he meant to fiand for the Consulship. He accordingly appeared in the ca- pacity of candidate for this honour, and by vaunt- ing, inflead of concealing, the obscurity of his birth; by inveighing against the whole order of Nobility, their dress, their city manners, their Greek learning, their family images, the stress they laid on the virtue of their ancestors to com-

Metellus, and by promising a speedy ifiue to the war, if it Ihould be entrusted to himself; a pro- mise, to which the force and ability he had fiewn in all the stations he had hitherto filled, procured. him much credit; he so far won upon the People, that, in opposition to the interest of the Nobles, and to the influence of all the leading men of the Senate, he prevailed in the election His promotion was in a particular manner offensive to Metellus, whose reputation he had attacked, and to whom,. by an express order of the People, in contempt of a different arrangement made by the Senate, he was now to succeed. U. c. 646. Upon the nomination of Marius, the party who' L. Cafflus Longinus, had opposed his preferment, did not attempt to with- C. Marius. hold the reinforcements which he asked for the ser-
vice in which he was to command. They even hoped to increase his difficulties, by suffering him to augment the military establishment of his pro- vince. The wealthier or more refpetable class of the People alone were yet admitted into the legions; and being averse to such distant services, were likely to conceive a dislike to the persons by whom they were dragged from home. Ma- rius, therefore, in making his levies, his opponents supposed, might lose some part of the popular fa- vour which he now enjoyed, and become less for- midable to his rivals in the State. But this crafty and daring adventurer, by flighting the laws which
excluded
excluded the nec'essitous citizens from serving in CH A P. the legions, found in this class of the People, a T. X numerous and willing recruit. They crowded to his standard, and filled up his army without delay, and even without offence to those of a better con- dition, who were pleased with the relief they ob- tained from this part of their public burdens.
This circumflance is quoted as a remarkable and dangerous innovation in the Roman.State, and is frequently mentioned among the Rteps which hastened its ruin. The example, no doubt, with its consequences, may inftru6t nations to diftin- guiih the military operations required at a di- fiance, from the more important objec of prefer- vation and home-defence; so that in declining the distant service, the more refpedable orders of the People may not think it necessary to abandon themselves to depredation at home. In the first ages of Rome, the citizens in political convention, were styled the Army of their Country, and such in every age is the army in wlhofe hands the freedom of nations is secure. From the date of there le- vies at Rome, the sword began to pass from the hands of those who were interested in the prefer- vation of the republic, into the hands of others who were willing to make it a prey. The cir- cumfiances of the times were such, indeed, as to give warning of the change. The service of a legionary soldier abroad, was become too severe for those of the People who could live at their cafe, and it now opened to.the necessitous a prin-
cipal
CHAP. cipal road to profit, as well as honour. Marius,
- to facilitate his levies, was willing to gratify both ;
and thus gave beginning to the formation of armies who were ready to fight for or against the laws Qs their country, and who, in the sequel, fubfti- tuted battles in the itreets of Rome, for the blood- lss contefis which, in the early ages of Rome. had arisen from the divisions of party.
The new Coniul, unrivalled in the favour of the People, obtained whatever he required; and, be- ing completely provided for the service to which he was destined, embarked for Africa, and with a great reinforcement, in a few days arrived at Uttica. Upon his arrival, the operations of the war were resumed, and carried into the wealthieR provinces of Numidia, where he encouraged his army with the hopes of spoil. The new levies though composed of persons hitherto untrained and even excluded from the military service, were formed by the example of the legions already in the field, and who were now well apprised of their own superiority to the African armies. Boc- chus and Jugurtha, upon the approach of this enemy, thought proper to separate, and took dif- ferent routes into places of safety in the more difficult and inaccessible parts of the country.
This reparation was made at the suggestion of Jugurtha, who alleged that, upon their appearing to despair, and to discontinue all offensive opera- tions, the Roman general would become more fe- cure, and more open to surprise. But Marius,
without
without abating his vigilance, prefled where the c HAP. enemy gave way, over-ran the country; and took 2. possession of the towns they had left. To rival the glory which Metellus had gained in the re- dudtion of Thala, he ventured on a like enterprise, in the face of similar difficulties, by attacking Thapfa, a place surrounded with defarts, and in the midst of a land destitute of water, and of every resource for an army. Having succeeded in this design, he ventured, in his return to attack ano- ther fortress, in which, the place being-fuppofed impregnable, the royal treasures were lodged. This strong hold was placed on a rock, which was every where, except at one path that was for- tified with ramparts and towers, faced with steep and inaccessible cliffs. The garrison permitted the first approaches of the Romans with perfect security, and even derision. After some fruitless attacks, Marius, under some imputation of folly in having made the attempt, was about to desist from the enterprise, when a Ligurian, who had been used to pick snails on the cliffs over which this fortress was situate, found himself, in search of his prey, and by the growing facility of the as- cent, led to a height from which he began to have hopes of reaching the summit. He accordingly surmounted all the difficulties in his way; and the garrison being then intent on the opposite fide of the fortress to which the attack was directed, he returned unobserved. This intelligence he carried to Marius, ard undertook to be the guide
of
C H AP. of a detachment of chosen men, with an unufiual
XI. X I. number of trumpets and initruments of alarm,
who were ordered to follow his direcions. Ma- rius himself, to divert the attention of the befie- ged, and, on receiving a signal agreed upon from within, to be ready to make a vigorous and deci- five affdult, advanced to the walls. The Ligurian proceeded, though with much difficulty, to fulfil the expectations he had given. The soldiers who followed him were obliged to untie their sandals and their helmets, to fling their Ihields and their swords, and, at difficult parts of the rock, could not be persuaded to advance until their guide had repeatedly paced and repafied in their fight, or had found fRumps and points of the itone at which they could fasten ropes to aid their ascent. The summit was to be gained at last by climbing a tree which, being rooted in a cleft of the rock, grew up to the edge of the precipice. By the trunk of this tree the whole party passed, and, being as high as its branches could carry them, landed at last on the summit. They inflantly founded their trumpets and gave a sudden alarm. The besieged, who had been drawn to an opposite part of the walls to reiift the enemy who there me- naced an attack, were astonished with this found in their rear, and soon after, greatly terrified with the confuted flight from behind them of women, chil- dren, and men unarmed, and being at the fame time vigorously pressed at their gates, were no longer able to resist, suffered the Romans to force
their
their way at this entrance, and in the end to be- c HA P. come masters of the fort. xL.
While Marius was engaged in the siege of this place, he was joined by the Questor Sylla, who had been left in Italy to bring up the cavalry, which were not ready to embark at the departure ,f the Consul. This young man was a Patrician, but of a family which had not, for some genera- tions, borne any of the higher offices of State. He himself partook in the learning which then spread into Italy, from a communication with the Greeks, and had passed the early part of his life in town-diffipation or in literary studies, of which the last, though coming into fashion at this time at Rome, was confidered as a species of corruption almost equal to the firfl. He was yet a novice in war, but having an enterprising genius, soon became an object of respect to the soldiers, and of jealousy to his general, with whom he now laid the foundation of a quarrel fiill more fatal to the commonwealth than that which had subsisted be- tween the present and preceding commander in this service.
The king of Numidia, flung by the sense of what he had already loft, and expecting no ad- vantage from any further delays, determined, in conjuncion with his ally, to make a vigorous es- fort, and to oblige Marius, who was then moving towards his winter quarters, yet to hazard a battle for the preservation of what, he had acquired in phe preceding campaign.. The king of Maurita-
nia,
C H A P. nia, upon the late events of the war, had been in-
XI '- -l. dined to return to his neutrality, or to enter on
a separate treaty with the Romans; but being proimifed a third part of the kingdom of Numidia, in cafe the enemy were expelled from thence, or if the war should be otherwise brought to a hap- py cbnclufion, he once more advanced with his army, and joined Jugurtha. ' The prosperous state of the Romans, undifturb- ed for some time by any opposition from an enemy in the field, inspired them with some degree of negligence or security, by which they were ex- posed to surprise. Near the close of a careless march, and about an hour before the setting of the fun, they found themselves entering among scattered parties, who, without any fettled order, increased in their numbers, occupied the fields through which the Romans were to pass, and seem- ed to intend, by aflailing them on every fide, to begin the night with a scene of confusion, of which they might afterwards more effecually avail them- selves in the dark. In an action begun under there disadvantages, Jugurtha flattered himself, that the Roman army might be entirely defeated, or, in a country with which they were not ac- quainted, and in circumstances for which they were not at all prepared, being unable to effect a retreat, be obliged to surrender at discretion.
The king, with his usual intrepidity and con. duc, profited by every circumstance which pre- sented itself in his favour. He brought the troops,
of
of which his army was composed, whether Getu- c IHA P. lians or Numidians, horse or foot, to harass the --' enemy in their different ways of fighting, and wherever they could most easily make their attacks. Where a party was repulscd, he took care to re- place it; and sometimes affecEed to remit his ar- dour, or to flee with every appearance of panic, in order to tempt the Romans to break from their ranks. Marius, notwithstanding, with great dex- terity and presence of mind, maintained the form of his march; and, before night, got possession of some heights on which he could reft with safety. He himself, with the infantry, chose that which had the fleepeft ascent, and ordered Sylla, with the cavalry, to take his post on a fmnaller and more ac- ceffible eminence below. That his position might not be known to the enemy, he prohibited the lighting of fires, and the usual founding of trum- pets at the different watches of the night. The Numidians had halted on the plain where night overtook them, and were observed, at break of day, reposing in great security, and without any seem- ing apprehension of danger from an enemy, who was supposed to be flying, and who, on the prece- ding day, had, with some difficulty, escaped from their hands. In this situation, Marius resolved to attack them, and gave orders, which were passed through the ranks, that, at a general found of the trumpets, every man should itand to his arms, and with a great ihout, and beating on his shield, make an impetuous afflult on the enemy. The design,
VOL. 1I. E accordingly,
c H A P. accordingly, succeeded. The Numidians, who on ..__- former occasions had often affected to flee, were
driven into an acdual route. Great numbers fell in the flight, and many ensigns and trophies were taken.
After this victory, Marius, with his usual pre- cautions, and though it might be supposed that the enemy were dispersed, without remitting his vigilance, directed his march to the towns on the coast, where he intended to fix his quar- ters for the winter. Jugurtha, well apprised of his route, proposed again to surprise him be- fore he should reach the end of his journey; and, for this purpose, avoided giving him any premature or unnecefiary cause of alarm. He deferred his attack until the Roman army was arrived in the neighbourhood of Cirta, supposed to be the end, of their labours, and near to which it was proba- ble they would think themselves secure from any further attempts of their enemy. In the execu- tion of this design, he, with the greatest ability, condudced his troops to the place of action, and there too made every effort of conduct and rcfolu- tion. But the match being unequal, he was ob- liged to give up the contest; and, with his sword and his armour all bathed in blood, and almost a- lone, is said to have left a field, in which, for the firif time, he had taken no precautions for re-af- fembling an army, and on which his Numidians were accordingly routed, in appearance, to rally no more.
Upon
Upon there repeated defeats, Bocchus despaired c H A P. *of the fortunes of Jugurtha, and sent a deputation -l to Marius, requesting a conference with himself, c. Atti7s
Serannus, or with some of his officers. He obtained an in- ji,'tus terview with Sylla and Manlius; but, upon their v7Ti's arrival, had taken no fixed resolution, and was fiill kept in fufpence, by the persuasion of those of his court who favoured the interest of Jugurtha. Ma- xius, being continued in his command, resumed the operations of the war, and was about to attack the only place which yet remained in the hands of the enemy. When the king of Mauritania, alarm- ed by this circumstance, took his resolution to sue for peace, he sent a deputation of five chosen per- sons, first to the quarters of Marius, and, with this general's permission, ordered them to proceed from thence to Rome. These deputies, being admitted into the Senate, made offers of friendship in the name of their malter; but were informed, in re- turn, that he must give proofs of his friendly dif- .position to the Romans, before they could rely on his professions, or -lilten to any terms of peace. When this answer was reported to Bocchus, he was not at a loss to underhtand that the Romans .wilied him to deliver up the king of Numidia in- .to their hands; and seems to have conceived the design of purchasing peace, even on there terms. .Sylla being already personally known to him, he -made choice of this officer, as the person with whom lhe would treat, and desired he might be sent to his quarters. The Roman QSelflor accordingly set
E out
C H P. out with a small party. On the way he was met
--v by Volux, the son of the king of Mauritania, with
a thousand horse: him he confidered as of doubt- ful intention, whether destined to a't as a friend or an enemy; but coming with professions of friend- ihip from the king his father, and with orders to escort the Roman Qupaftor, they proceeded toge- ther. On the second day after this jundion, Vo- lux came in haste to the quarters of Sylla, and in- formed him, that the advanced party had discover- ed Jugurtha pdóed on their route, with numbers through which they might not be able to force their way, and earnefftly pressed the Roman officer to endeavour his own escape in the night.
Sylla could no longer disguise his suspicions, and, sensible that he had imprudently, without hof- tage or other security, ventured too far on the faith of an African prince, proudly refused to alter his march; desired that the Mauritanian prince, if he thought proper, fmould depart; but informing him, at the fame time, that the Roman people would know how to avenge so public an insult, and would not fail to puniflh the perfidy of the king his father. Volux, in return, made firong protestations of in- nocence; and as the Roman Questor could not be prevailed on to save himself by flight, this prince insisted to remain, and to share in his danger. They accordingly kept on their way, pasTed in the view of Jugurtha with his party, who, though dif- posed to offer violence to the Romans, had yet some n'cm'furtes to prefferve with the king of Mauritania,
whos
whose son was in company; and thus while, con- c H A P. trary to his usual character, he remained undeci- _.., ded, the prey escaped him, or got out of his reach.
Jugurtha sent persons of confidence immediate- ly to counteract the negotiations of Sylla at the court of Bocchus; and each of these parties soli- cited the king of Mauritania to betray the other. The Numidians endeavoured to persuade him, that, with such an hostage as Sylla in his hands, he might still expec some honourable terms from the Ro- mans; and Sylla, on the other part, represented, that, as the king of Mauritania had offended the Romans, by abetting the crimes of Jugurtha, he must now expiate his guilt by delivering him over to justice. It was the inclination of this prince to favour his Numidian ally; but it was his interest, as well as his intention, to gain the Romans. While he was frill in fufpence, he gave equal encourage- ment to both parties; and, without being finally determined what he should do, appointed the Ro- man Questor and the king of Numidia to meet him without any escort, or number of men in arms on ei- ther fide, reserving, for himself, to the last moment the power of determining against the one or the other. BY the time, however, that the parties were met, he had taken his resolution, had placed a bo- dy of his own troops in ambush, and, before any conference took place, gave a signal, which his men underitood to be for seizing Jugurtha. The Nu- mid.ians, who attended their king, were slain; he himself was put in chains, and delivered up to 'ie
E 3 Roman
H A P. Roman Quaitor. Sylla, with the exultation of a
. successful hunter, received this lion in his toils;
and, though he lived to perform much greater actions, still appears to have valued himfilf most on the event of this tranfadion. He boasted £o much of his prize, that he became, from that mo- ment, an object ofjealoufy to Marius, and was con- fidered as a person advancing too fait in the fame career of renown '. It was understood among the Romans, that the commander in chief, upon any service, in any division or province of the empire, enjoyed the triumph for victories gained, even in his own absence, by his lieutenants, or by those who served under his command; and Marius probably thought that Sylla took more to himself than was due upon this occasion. The desire of being the person who put the finishing hand to any matter of great public concern, however accomplished, was not peculiar to these officers. It was an effet of the Roman policy in making the rewards of dif- tinction depend so much on events, without regard to the means which were employed to produce them. A circumflance, from which the citizens of this republic were as desirous of having the re- putation of successful adventures affixed to their names, as courtiers in modern Europe are desirous of titles, or covet badges of honour and marks of their sovereign's favour.
The war being thus at an end, Marius appoint- ed a thankigiving; and, while he was offering the
customary Plutarch. in MIaria et in Syl'a.
customary sacrifices, the news arrived from Rome c HI A '. that the People had dispensed with the law in his x'. favour, and again had eleaed him Consul for the following year. This choice was determined by the great alarm which the Romans had taken on the approach of the barbarous nations, who, like a meteor, had, for some years, traversed the regions of Europe, and, with uncertain direction, were said to deflroy wherever they moved. The Romans had repeatedly stood in their way, and had provoked a resentment, which these barbarians were supposed, in haste, to wreck upon Italy. They were at firit heard of under the name only of Cimbri; but were now known to consist of many nations, un- der the appellations of Ambrones, Teutones, Tec- tofagi, and others; and had gained acceflions of force by the junaion of the Tigurini, and other Gaulish nations, who, either by choice or compul- sion, were made a part in this mighty host, whose movements the Romans conlidered as now chiefly directed againit themselves.
Betides the armies commanded by the Consuls u. c. 64s.
P Rutilius Carbo and Silanus, which had fallen victims to this Rufus, Cn. barbarous enemy, other considerable bodies, under Malius. Scaurus and Cassius, had perished by their hands; and other misfortunes, from the fame quarter, were coming apace. At the time thatMarius had finished the war with Jugurtha, Quintus Servius Caepio, ha- ving the'former year commanded in Gaul, where he destroyed or pillaged the city of Tolofa, and made a great booty, consisting, according to Juftin,
E 4 of
c H A P. of one hundred thousand pounds weight of gold,
X-I. and one million five hundred thousand pounds
weight of silver, was now, in his turn, to meet with this torrent of wandering nations; the Consul Mal- lius or Manilius had orders to join him; and all the troops they could assemble were but too few to withstand such an enemy. These generals united their forces on the Rhone, but without a proper disposition to ad in concert; they were according- ly defeated in battle; eighty thousand Romans, amongIt whom were the two sons of the Consul Manilius, were killed in the acion; forty thousand attendants of the army were maafacred in cold blood. Both camps were taken.
After this victory, the lords of the Cimbri, being assembled in council, called before them Aurelius Scaurus, formerly a Roman Consul, lately second in command over one of their vanquished ar- mies, and now a prisoner. They questioned him with refpet to the forces in Italy, and the route to be taken across the Alps: To these questions he made answer, That itwould be in vain for them to invade that country: that the Romans, on their own territory, were invincible. And, in return to these words, it is said, that a Barbarian firuck the prisoner with his dagger to the heart. It is fur- ther said of this barbarous council, that they came to a resolution to spare no prisoners, to destroy the ipoils of the slain, to cast all the treasures of gold and lilver into the nearest river, to deltroy all hor- fes with their saddles and furniture, and to save no
booty
booty whatever. It must be confessed, that in this, c HAP. their resolutions were guided by a policy well x . accommodated to the manner of life they had chosen. Wealthy poifeffions frequently disqualify even fettled nations for the toils of war, but to hordes in continual migration, the accommodations of luxury and sloth, would be certain impediments and the means of ruin .
These accounts of impending enemies, and of the disasters which besel the Roman armies which ventured to encounter them, were received at Rome with amazement and terror. The citizens changed their dress, and aifumed the military habit. Ru- tilius, the Consul, who had remained in the admi- niftration of affairs in Italy, had inftrudtions from the Senate .to array every person that was fit to bear arms. No one who had attained the military age was exempted. It is mentioned, that the ion of the Consul himself was turned into the ranks of a legion. There was little time to train such levies; and the usual way was thought insufficient. The fencing-mailers, employed to train gladiators for the public shews, were brought forth, and diftri- buted to inftruft the citizens in the use of their weapons 2. But the expedient, on which the People chiefly relied for deliverance from the dangers which threatened them, was the repeated nomina- tion of Marius to command againit this terrible enemy.
This officer, upon hearing of his re-eleCion, set out for Italy, and, with his legions and their cap-
tives, 1 Orofius, lib. v. c. I6. Eutrop. lib, v. z Valer. Max; lib. ii. c. 3.
c H A P. tives, made his entrance at Rome in triumph; a spec-
x. tacle, of which Jugurtha, in chains, with his unfor-
tunate children, were the principal figures. When the procession was over, the captive king was led to a dungeon, under orders for his immediate execu- tion. As he was about to be stripped of his orna- ments and robes, the executioner, in haste to pluck the pendants from his ears, tore away the flesh, and thrust him naked into a circular aperture into which he descended with a smile, faying, " What a cold " bath is here?" He pined about fix days under ground, and expired. A king and an able comman- der would, in such a situation, have been an object ofrefped and of pity, if we did not recollect, that he was the murderer of Adherbal and Hiempfal, the innocent children of his benefador ; and if we did not receive some consolation from being told, that his own children, who were likewise innocent, were exempted from the lot of their father, and honourably entertained in Italy.
Marius, in this triumph, is said to have brought into the treasury three thousand and seven pounds, or thirty thousand and seventy ounces of gold, and fifty-feven thousand seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver; and in money, two hundred and eigh- ty-feven thousand denarii 1. He entered the Se- nate, contrary to cufiom, in his triumphal robes, probably to insult the Nobles, who used to despise him as a person of obscure extration, born in a country town, and of a mean family: but finding
that . About L. ;o,coo,
that this was confidered as an at of petulance, and c H A P. generally condemned, he withdrew and changed v his dress.
The kingdom of Numidia was dismembered; part was put into the possession of Bocchus as a re- ward for his late services; and part reserved for the surviving heirs of Massinissa.

Consuls; no one could be eleted in absence, nor re-elected c. Aiarius into this office, till after an interval of ten years. Flaius Both clauses were dispensed .with in favour of Fimbria" Marius, under pretence of continuing him at the head of the army; but as he might flill have re- mained in his flation, and have rendered the fame services to the State in the quality of Pro- consul, his re-election may be ascribed to his own ambition, and to his jealousy of other rising men in the State. Being reputed head of the popular party, his personal elevation was an object of zeal to the Tribunes of the People, and was intended to mortify those wno affected the diftindions of antient family. Contrary to the usual form, and without casting lots, for the assignation of his Pro- vince, he was preferred to his colleague in the ap- pointment to command in Gaul. Having his choice of all the armies at that time in Italy, he took the new levies, lately aflembled and disciplined by Ru- tilius, in preference to the veterans, who had ser- ved in Africa under Metellus andhimfelf. It is pro- bable that he wvas determined in this choice, more by his desire to gratify the veterans, who wiflied

;X'. their labours, than by the consideration of any sup-
posed superiority in the discipline to which the new levies had been trained x
Upon the arrival of Marius in his province, it appeared, that the alarm taken for the safety of Italy was somewhat premature. The Barbarians in their battles only meant to maintain the reputa- tion of their valour, or to keep open the track of their migrations. They had found the lands, from about the higher parts of the Danube and the Rhine, through Gaul and across the Pyrenees into Spain, and to the ocean, convenient for their pur- pose, and sufficiently extensive. They had not yet meditated any war with the Romans, or other na- tion in particular; but did not decline any contest where they met with refinance. At present they continued their migrations to the westward, with- out attempting to cross the Alps, or teeming to have knowledge of nations who inhabited the pe- ninfula of Italy within those mountains.
We have nothing recorded in history concern- ing the movements of these wandering hordes, du- ring the two subsequent years, except what is re- lated of their adventure with Fulvius, a Roman Praetor, probably in Spain, who, in return for hof- tilities committed in his province, having made a feint to draw the attention of their warriors else- where, surprised and sacked their camp. Under the apprehension, however, of their return towards
Gaul z Frontius de Stragemzt, lib, iv, c. ?,
Gaul and Italy, Marius continued to be eleted CHAP. Consul, and was repeatedly named to the command X . of the army that was destined to oppose them. His party at Rome had, at this time, besides the exi- gency which justified their choice of such a leader, many other advantages against their antagonists, and maintained the usual contest of envy in the lower people against the pride of nobility with great animosity and zeal.

CHA1. THE Senate had, for some time after the sup- --1--v- _3 pression of the troubles which were raised
by Fulvius and the younger Gracchus, retained its authority, and restrained the Tribunes of the Peo- ple within ordinary bounds; but by the miicar- riages of the war in Numidia, and the suspicions which arose against them, on the subjeC of their tranfadtions with Jugurtha. they again loft their ad- vantage. It is difficult to ascertain the real grounds of these suspicions. Saluft seems to admit them in their utmost extent, and represents the whole order of nobility as mercenary traders, difpoied to fell what the Republic entrusted to their honour. That the presents of Jugurtha were Sometimes ac- cepted, and had their effe&, is not to be doubt- ed; but that the aristocracy of Rome, during its temporary ascendant, was so much corrupted, as the relation of this historian implies, is cfarcely to be credited. Such a measure of corruption must have rendered the State a prey to every rival that x'as in condition to mislead its ccuncils, and is not
consistent
consistent with that superiority which the Romans c H A P.
XII. then generally possessed in their negotiations, as. XI well as in their wars. The charge itself favours too much of that envy with which the lower class of the People at all times interpret the conduct of their superiors, and which at the time when Saluft wrote his history, was greatly countenanced by the partizans of Caesar, in order to vilify and traduce the Senate. We cannot, however, oppose mere conjecure to the positive tetfimony of Saluft, cor- roborated by some suspicious circumstances in the tranfations of the times. Among these we may recollea the patronage which Jugurtha met with at Rome, contrary to the general sense of the Peo- ple, and the uncommon presumption of guilt im- plied in the degradation of so many members as were about the fame time, by the authority of the Censors, Q Caecilius Metellus- and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus ', expelled from the Se- nate.
Whatever may have been the real occasion of the cry then subsisting against the Nobles, we have seen that the popular party, availing themselves of it, and giving it all manner of countenance, found means to recover great part of the power they had formerly loft. The Tribunes, having obtained the eftabliflment of a special commission for the trial of those who had received any bribes from Jugurtha, the people mistook their own ad

c H A P. in conflituting a court of inquiry, as sufficient to
Xl. cr evince the reality of the crime. The prosecutions
which continued to be carried on for two years, upon this supposition, served more than the sub- jea of any former dispute to exasperate and to alienate the minds of men from each other, and from the public. Questions were more of a pri- vate than of a public nature, and occupied the wvornl of the human passions, envy, malice, and re- venge. One party learned to cherish falsehood, subornation, and perjury; the other lived in con- tinual and degrading fear of having such engines employed against themselves.
The People, in their zeal to attack the Nobility under any pretence, made no diftindion between errors and crimes; and, contrary to the noble fpi- rit of their ancestors, treated misfortune, incapaci- ty, and treachery, with equal rigour. One Tri- bune had extended the use of the secret ballot in giving judgment on certain offences or mifdemea- nors'; another, upon this occasion, took away all diflintions, or introduced the fame cover of fecre- cy in the trial of capital crimes : insomuch, that a judge draughted from among the parties then at variance, could, without being accountable, in- dulge his malice or partial favour, so as to affect the life as well as the honour of a fellow citizen 3 to whom he bore any spite.
Laws were made to promote'the interest, as well as to gratify the animosity, of the lower people.

By the Agrarian law of Gracchus, no -one could c HA F, poflef. above a certain measure in land; but in or- .- der to render the surplus of property to be furren- dered immediately useful to the People, it was per- mitted, by an amendment of the law made during the low {tate of the ariftocratical party, that per- sons holding more than the legal measure, might retain their possession, but subjed to a rent to be collected for the benefit of the poorer citizens; and thus it was provided, that without difconti- nuing the practice of fadion, or removing into what was confidered as a species of exile in the country, the favourites of the party should be ac- commodated, and reap the fruits of sedition and -idleness, while they continued to pursue the fame course of life in the city1.
It was proposed, by the Consul Servilius Caepio, u. c. 647.
Lex Scrvi- that the Senate, whose members were personally lia deJudi so much exposed to prosecutions, should have cis' their share likewise in composing the courts of justice, a privilege of which, by the edid of Gracchus, they had been deprived2. In wha-t- ever degree this proposal was adopted, it was again expressly rejeced upon the motion of Servilius Glaucia. And Caepio soon after experienced, in his own person, the animosity of the popular sac- tion: Being tried for micfarriage in his battle with the Cimbri, he was condemned by the judges, and afterwards, by a separate act obtained by Caf- fius, one of the Tribunes, declared, in consequence

Betides the transactions already mentioned, the following particulars, overlooked in the hurry of recording military operations and events, may serve fill further to characterize the times. M. Junius Silanus was tried for misconduct against the enemy; M. Emilius Scaurus, first on the roll of the Senate, was brought to trial for contempt of religion ; but both acquitted. The ardour for these prosecutions and popular regulations, con- tinued without abatement, until the second Con- fulate of Marius, when M. Marcius Philippus, one of the Tribunes, moved to revive the law of Tiberius Gracchus refpeaing the division of estates in land, which, from this circumstance, Ihould ap- pear had never been executed; and, in his speech to support this motion, affirmed, that there were not then two thousand families in Rome possessed of any property in land whatever2. This motion, however, was withdrawn,
Among the crimes which the populace were now so eager to punilh, fortunately that of pecu- lation or extortion in the provinces was one. To facilitate complaints on this subjed, not only per- sons having an immediate interest in the cafe, but all to whom any money or effects injuriously taken might have otherwise come by inheritance, were intitled to prosecute for this offence; and any alien, who convicted a Roman citizen of this crime, so

Domitius one of.the.Tribunes, attacked the ari- flocratical conflitution even of the priesthood, and endeavoured to transfer the right of election to va- cant places from the order itself to the People; but superstition, which often continues to influence the bulk of mankind after reason has failed, here flood in his way. The custom was against him; and in such matters, religion and custom are the fame. The People, therefore, it was confessed by the mo- ver of this reform, could not without profanation Lex Doni-
tia de Sa- pretend to elecr a priet ; but a certain part of the cerdotiis. People might judge of the candidates, and inftrud the college itself in the choice to be made 2. The fame artifice, or verbal evasion, had been already admitted in the form of electing the Pontifex Max- imus, presented to the order, not by the People at large, but by seventeen of the Tribes who were drawn by lot 3.
During this period, a charge of depravity, worse than that which was brought against those who were employed in the State, might with equal jus- tice be directed against those who were loudest in railing the cry of corruption; for liberty, on the part of the populace, was conceived to im- ply a freedom from every restraint, and to jus- tify license and contempt of the laws. The gra- tuitous aids which were given to the People, en-

CHAP. abled them to fuibfift in idleness and sloth; the
w .ealth that was palilng to Rome in the hands of traders, contracdors, and farmers of the revenue, was spent .i profusion. That which was acquir- ed by officers in one fiation of §ommand in the provinces, was lavished in public shews, in the baiting of wild beasts and fights of gladiators, to gain the People in the canvass for further prefer- ments : And from all these circumliances we may conclude, that if there be reason to regret or de- tell the abuses incident to monarchy, and the lux- ury of courts, there is surely no less in the brutal taste and dissolute manners incident to a populace, acknowledged in democracy the sovereign or fu- prcmc disposer of preferments and honours.
The severities which were praftifed in certain cafes, the sumptuary laws which were provided to relrain dissipation, were hut feeble aids to lop up the source of so much disorder. It is men- tioned, as an instance of severity which the times required, that some vestals were qucilioned for a breach of that sacred obligation to chafRity, under which they were held up as a pattern of manners to the ex at Rome ; that three of them were condemncd, and, together with so many Roman knights, the supposed partners in their guilt, fuf'ered extreme punifliment; but no two things are more consistent than fuperfliion and vice.

prayers were to be offered up in this temple, that c I A P.

The term luxury is somewhat ambiguous; it is put for sensuality or excess in what relates to the tifes or gratifications of animal nature; and for the effet of vanity, in what relates to the decorations of rank and fortune. The luxury of the Romans, in the present age, was probably of the former kind, and sumptuary laws were provided, not to restrain vanity, but to govern the appetites for mere debauch. About the time that Jugurtha was at Rome, the sumptuary law of Fannius re- ceived an addition, by which Roman citizens were not only restricted in their ordinary expence, but the legal quantities and species of food were dif- tintly prescribed. The whole expence of the. table was reftrited to thirty asses 1 a-day, and the meat to be served up, to three or four pounds, dried or salted. There was no reftridion in the use of herbs or vegetables of any fort'. Ac- cording to A. Gellius, the law permitted, on cer- tain days, an expence of an hundred asses; on wedding-days, two hundred. It is remarkable, tha;sthis law continued to have its effet on the

. The Epicures of his time were obliged to make
up, in the cookery of their vegetable diet, what was defective in that species of food.
About the time of the commencement of the Numidian war, the People, according to the Cen- sus, amounted to four hundred and three thousand four hundred and thirty-fix citizens, fit to carry arms. At this time it was that the Censors, Quin- tus Caecilius Mettellus, and Cn. Domitius Aheno- barbus, as already mentioned, expelled thirty-two members from the Senate.
While the Romans were intent on the war which subsisted in Africa, they were not exempted from like trouble in other parts of their empire. In Spain particularly, hostilities, at intervals, were Rill renewed. There, in trying to quell a revolt of the natives, a Roman Praetor was killed; in another encounter, the forces employed against the natives, were cut off; and a frelh army was transported from Italy, to secure the Roman pof- sessions.
Hostilities were likewise continued on the fron- tier of Macedonia, by the Scordifci, Triballi, and other Thracian nations; and the Proconsul Ru- sus, by his victories in this quarter, obtained a triumph.
During this period, in the Confulflip of Attili- us Serranus, and Q. Servilius Cxepio, the year as- ter the first Consulship of Marius, were born two
illustrious r Ewilf,. ad Familiar. lib. xii. ad Gallurn.
illustrious citizens, M. Tulliits Cicero, and Cneiusc i A p. Pompeius Strabo, afterwards diftiriguiflCed by the i , appellation of Pompey the Great. And with the mention of these names we are now to open the scene in which persons, on whom the fate of the Roman empire was to depend, made their several entries into life, or into public business, and in which they began to pass through an infancy or a youth of danger, to an old age of extreme trouble, which closed with the subversion of that conftitu- tion of government under which they were born.
Marius having, without any memorable event, u. . 65c pafled the year of his second Consulship on the Caius Ma-
~~~- . ^rius 3tio. L, frontier of Narbonne Gaul, was, by the People, still Aurelius under the fame apprehension of the Cimbric inva- sion, re-eleced, and defined to remain in his fia- tion. This year likewise the Barbarians turned aside from the Roman province, and left the re- public at leisure to contend with enemies of less consideration, who appeared in a different quarter. Athenio, a slave in Sicily, having murdered his maf- ter, and broken open the prisons or walled inclofures in which slaves were commonly confined at work, assembled a number together, and being himself clothed in a purple robe, with a crown and sceptre, affected a species of royalty; while he invited all the laves of the island to aflume their freedom under his protection. He acquired strength fiuficient to cope with Servilius Cafca, the Roman Praetor, and actually forced him in his camp. He likewise defeated the succeeding Praetor, Licinius Lucul-
F4 lus;
c H A P. lus ; and was, in the third year of his infurrec-
y '. tion, with great difficulty, reduced by the Consul
Aquilius, This revolt was at its height in this- year of the third Consulship of Marius, and the rebels being surrounded in their itrong holds, and obliged to surrender for want of provisions, it was quelled in the second year after this Consulship 2 The whole is mentioned now, that it may not re- cur hereafter to interrupt the series of matters more important.
About the fame time the Romans had been ob- liged to equip a naval armament under Marcus An- tonius, known by the appellation of the Orator, a- gainft the Cilician pirates, who had lately infested the seas. All that we know of this service is, in general, that it was performed with ability and fuc- cess 3.
From Macedonia, Calpurnius Pifo reported, that the vicory he had gained over the Thracians had enabled him to penetrate to the mountains of Rho- dope and Caucasus.
Such was the state of the empire when Caius Ma- rius arrived from his province in Gaul, to. preside at a new election of Consuls. He was himself again, by the voice of the People,. called upon to resume his trust but he affedted, with an appearance of modesty, to decline the honour. His partizans were apprised of the part he was to ad, and were ac- cordingly prepared, by their importunities, to force
him x Florus, lib. iii. c. 2 Ibid. lib. i?. C. I*. .^ Ibid, li:. iii. c 6. Cicero :le Orator. lii'. r.
him into an office which he certainly did not mean c HA P. to decline. Among these, Apuleius Saturninus, at -L this time himself candidate for the office of Tribune, charged Marius with treachery to his country in proposing to desert the republic in times of so much danger; and with his reproaches seemed to pre- vail so far as to render this favourite of the Peo- ple passive to the will of his fellow-citizens, who wvifled to re-inflate ' him in his former command.
In this fourth Consulate, the courage and milil- u. c. Sr.
Caius Ala- tary skill of Marius came to be actually exerted in riuLsto L. his province. The barbarous nations, after their catlu,. return from Spain, began to appear in separate bo- dies, each forming a numerous and formidable ar- my. In one division the Cimbri and Tectofages had passed through the whole length of Gaul to the Rhine; from thence proceeded by the Danube to Noricum or Austria, and by the passes of Carin- thea, or by the valley of Trent, might have an easy access to Italy. The Consul Lutatius Catulus was stationed on the Athefis, near the descent of the Alps, to observe the motions of this body.
In another diviiion, the Ambrones and the Teu- tones, between the Garonne and the Rhone, hung on the frontier of the Roman province, and gave out, that they meant, by another route of the mountains, to join their allies who were expeccd on the Po.
Upon the approach of this formidable enemy in the division to which he nwas opposed, MP1a- i'ius took post on the Rhone at thj con.iuernct

xI. in the most eftfetual manner. The Barbarians, re-
proaching him with cowardice for having taken there precautions, sent, agreeably to their own no- tions of war, a formal challenge to meet them in battle; and having had for answer, That the Ro- mans did not consult their enemies to know when it was proper to fight, they were confirmed in their usual contempt, ventured to leave the Roman ar- my behind, and proceeded in separate divisions to look out for a passage into Italy. Marius follow- ed; with rapid marches, overtook them in their progress, and even dispersed over the country, with- out precaution or order; some of them near to the Roman colony of Sextius ', and far removed from each other. Having found them under such dif- advantage, and in such condition as exposed them to slaughter, with scarcely any means of resistance, he put the greater part to the sword. Thus, one part of the hordes, who had for years been so formidable to the Romans, were now entirely cut off. Ninety thousand prisoners, with Teutobochus, one of their kings, were taken, and two hundred thousand were said to be slain in the field z, accounts which, with some others relating to this war, we may suspect to be exaggerated.

it was known that a second swarm of the fame hive, c H A P.
XII. not less formidable than the firfi, frill hung on the approaches to Italy, it was not to be doubted that the command and office of Consul would still be continued to Marius. The populace, incited by some of the factious Tribunes, joined, with the other usual marks of their attachment to this fa.. vourite leader, that of disrespect and insolence to those who were supposed to be his opponents and rivals. Of these, Metellus Numidicus, whom he had supplanted in the command of the army against Jugurtha, was the chief This refpedable citizen, being now in the office of Censor, one Equi- tius, an impostor of obfcute or slavish extration, offered himself to be enrolled as a citizen, under the popular designation and name of Caius Grac- chus, the son of Tiberius. The Censor, doubting his title, called upon Sempronia, the sifter of Grac- chus, to testify what she knew of this pretended relation; and, upon her giving evidence against him, rejected his claim. But the populace, ill-dif- posed to Metellus, on account of his supposed difa- greement with Marius, took this opportunity to in- fult the Censor in the discharge of his office; attack- ed his house, and obliged him to take refuge in the Capitol. Even there the Tribune Saturninus would have laid violent hands on his person, if he had not been protected by a body of the Roman Knights, who had assemblcd in arms to defend him. This tumult was fuippreffcd. but not with- out blood fld.
\Vliit.
C A P. While the popular faction was indulging in these
xIIr. marks of dislike to Mctellus, they proceeded to u. c. 653. beflow the honours which they intended for Ma- Caius MIa- tius to,M. rius, and chose him for a fifth time Consul, in con-
. junction with M. Aquilius. His late splendid fuc-
cesses against one division of the wandering Bar- barians juitified this choice, and pointed him out as the fittest person to combat the other, which was still expected from the banks of the Danube, to attempt the invasion of Italy. Catulus, the late colleague of Marius, commanding the troops that were Rfationed on the Athefis, to cover the access to Italy from what is now called the Tyrol and the valley of Trent, was defined to at in sub- ordination to the Consul, who had given orders to haften the passage of his victorious army from the other extremity of the Alps and the Rhone.
Catulus had taken post near Verona, thrown a bridge over the Athefis, and, in order to command the paifage of that river, had fortified flations on both its banks. While he was in this posture, and before the juncion of Marius, the enemy arrived in his neighbourhood. The amazing works which they performed might serve to confirm the report of their numbers. They obfiruc'ed with mounds of timber and earth the channel of the Athefis, so as to force it to change its course; and by this means, instead of themselves palling the river, they threw it behind them in their march. They continued to float such quantities of wood towards the bridge which Catulus had constructed, that the itream
being
being obitrudced, the bridge itself, unable to sustain c H A P. such a pressure, with all the timber which was ac- . cumulated before it, was entirely carried off. The troops of Rome, on feeing such proofs of the num- bers and firength of their enemy, were seized with a panic. Many deserted their colours, some fled even to the city itself, without halting. The Pro- consul, to hide his disgrace, thought proper to or- der a retreat; and by this order, seeming to autho- rife what he could not prevent, endcavoured to save in part the credit of his army.
The level country on the Po was in this man- ner laid open to the incursions of the Barbarians. The inhabitants of Italy were greatly alarmed: and the Roman People pased an ad of attainder against all those who had abandoned their colours. Marius, who had been at Rome while he exped- ed the arrival of his army from Gaul, suspended the triumph which had been decreed to himself by the Senate, now went to receive the legions on their approach, and hastened to rally and to rein- force the army of Catulus.
Upon their juncion, those who had lately fled from the plains of Verona recovered their courage, and the generals determined, without loss of time, to hazard a battle. It is said that the Barbarians of this division were lill igno- rant of the disaster which had befallen their con- federates on the other fide of the Alps, and had fen- the Roman army a defiance or a challenge to fight; but that, being informed of their loss, when
they
C H A P. they were about to engage, they made their attack -^ ' _ with less than their usual ferocity or confidence.
Catulus received them in front. Marius made a movement to assail them in flank; but as the field was darkened by the clouds of dust which every where rose from the plain, he miffed his way, or could not fall in with the enemy till after they had been repulsed by Catulus, and were already put to flight. The rout, as usual, was extremely bloody; an hundred and fifty thousand were said to be slain; sixty thousand submitted to be taken. The remainder of this mighty host, even the women and children, perished by their own hands; and in this manner a race of barbarous nations who had migrated through Europe, perhaps for ages before they encountered with the Romans, now appear to have been entirely cut off'.
On receiving the news of this victory at Rome, the city resounded with joy, and the People, in every sacrifice they offered up, addressed themselves to Marius as to a god. He had been constantly at- tended in this war by Sylla, who, though already an object of his jcaloufy, still chose to neglec the preferments of the city, and to serve in the camp. I:- tie i.'crcry, now to be celebrated, Marius was no more than parmer with Catulus, and impatient as he will soon appear of any competition for power, did juitice to his colleague in this particular, admit-
ting i Plutarch. in P5Tario et Syl!a. Orofis, lib. v. c. i6. 16 l us? lib i i. . , Velleius. Eutrop. AprFin in Celt'ca.
ting him equally to partake in the triumph which c H A P.
XII. ensued. In this procession there were not any car- - riages loaded with gold, silver, or precious spoils of any fort; but, instead of them, the ihattered armour and broken swords of a ferocious enemy; the furer marks of an honour justly won, and of a more important service performed. These were transported in waggon-loads, and piled up in the Capitol.

CHAP. TT'PON the extindion of the wandering na- XIII. L---. ,ll tions which had now for some time molefr-
ed the empire, there was no foreign enemy to en- danger the peace of Italy. The wars in Thrace and in Spain had no efect beyond the provinces in which they subsisted. The insurrection of the slaves in Sicily, by the good condut of Aquilius the Consul, to whom that service had been commit- ted, was near being quelled.
Marius, being now returned to the city, might have quitted the paths of ambition with uncom- . mon diftinCion and honour. An ordinary Con- iUlate, after his having bcen so often called upon,
in
in times of extreme danger, as the person most c HA P. likely to save his country, could make no addition XIL to his glory. His being set aside in times of fecu- rity and leisure, on the contrary, mufi have been the most honourable and flattering comment that could have been made on his former elections.
But there is reason to believe, that immoderate thirst of power, and extreme animolity to his ri- vals, not genuine elevation of mind, were the charaderiftics of Marius. His ambition had hi- therto pafled for an aversion to ariftocratical ufur- pations. But his affeced and furious contempt of family diftindions, too often the offspring of fenfi- bility to the want of such honours, by claihing with the eflablifhed subordination of ranks in his country, became a source of disaffection to the State itfclf. He formed views upon the Consulate yet a sixth time; and instead of the moderation, or the satiety of honours with which he formerly pre- tended to be aduated, when he hoped to be pref- fed into office, he now openly employed all his in- fluence, even his money, to procure a re-election; and in the event prevailed, together with Valerius Flaccus. He had warmly espoused the interest of this candidate against Metellus, from animosity to the competitor, whose great authority, placed in opposition to himself, he dreaded, more than 'c: from any regard or predilection for Flaccus. Antd: :. now being chosen, in order the more to ftrengthenli :, :. himself in the exercise of his power, he enterel into concert with the Tribune Apuleils Saturninus,
VOL,. I. G and,
C H A P. and, it is probable, agreed to support this fadious
_-.- demagogue in his pretensions to remain in office
for another year; a precedent which had taken place only in the moit fadious times of the repub- lic, and which was in itself more dangerous than any other re-election whatever. The person of the Tribune being sacred, his will was absolute, there was no check to his power belides the fear of being called to account at the expiration of his term; and if this fear were removed by the per- petuity of office, it was a power yet more formi- dable than that of the Dictator, and to be reitrain- ed only by the divisions which might arise among those who were joined together in the exercise of it.
The fadtion now formed by Marius and the Tribune Saturninus, with their adherents, was farther strengthened by the accession of the Pr.ae- tor Glaucia. This person, while in office, and as he fat in judgment, had received an affront from Saturninus, in having his chair of state broken down, for presuming to occupy any part in the attention of the People, while an assembly called by the Tribune was met. He nevertheless chose to overlook this insult, in order to be admitted a partner in the consideration and power which was likely to devolve on there popular leaders.
Upon the approach of the tribunitian elections, the Senate and Nobles exerted themselves to pre- vent the re-elecion of Saturninus; and nine of the new candidates were, without any question,
declared
declared to be duly elected in preference to him. c 11 A P. The tenth place too, was actually filled by the . - election of Nonius Sufenas, whom the ariflocracy 'had supported with all its influence. But the party of Apuleius, enraged at their difappoinrt- ment, had recourse to violence, forced Nonius, though already veiled with the sacred character of Tribune, to take refuge in a work-shop, from whence he was dragged by some of the late fo-l- diery attached-to Marius, and slain. The assem- bly broke up with the cry of murder, and every fober person, though reputed of the popular party, retired from the fiene under the itrongeft im- pressions of afflicion and terror.
Marius had reason to apprehend some violent resolution from the Senate, and was in no hafle to aflemble that body. Mean time his associate Glaucia, in the night, at the head of a party ar- med with daggers, took pofleffion of the Capitol and place of assembly, and, at an early hour in the morning, pretending to observe all the forms of eletion, announced Apuleius again Tribune, in the place that was vacated by the murder of No- nius. This furious demagogue was accordingly reinitated in the sacred charater, which, though recently violated by himself, was still revered by the bulk of the People. He was continually at- tended by a new set of imen who infefled the Itreets, freemen of desperate fortune, whom Ma- rius, contrary to the eftablifled forms of the con- .fitution, had admitted into the legions, there
G v were
c T A P. were grown fierce and insolent, as partners in the
. victories of their general, and w.ere now made to expect that, in cafe the popular party should pre- vail, they themselves were to have comfortable settlements, and estates in land.
Under the dread of so many assassins, who con- fidered the Nobles as enemies to their cause, Ma- rius with his faction was become master of the' commonwealth. The better fort of the People was deterred from frequenting the public assem- blies, and no one had courage to propose, that any inquiry fllould be made into the death of the Tri- bune Nonius, in whose person the sacred law ha4 been again set at nought'. TrLcxAga- Apuleius hastened to gratify his party by mo-
ving popular aas. One to seize, in name of the Public, those lands beyond the Po which had lately been overrun and desolated by the barbarous na- tions, and to distribute them in lots to the poorer citizens -.
Another, by which it was enacted, that in the province of Africa a hundred jugera a man ihould be distributed to the veterans 3 : that new fettle- ments should be made in Greece, Macedonia, and Sicily : and that the money taken from the tem- ple at Tolofa 4 should be employed in the purchafc

of lands for a like purpose: that wherever these c H A P colonies ihould be planted, Marius fllould have a ..XI.. power to inscribe, at each of the settlements, the names of any three aliens into the lilt of citizens 1. Le, Fru. That the price, hitherto paid at the public gra-nta naries, should be discontinued, and that corn ihould be ditlributed gratis to the People.
Upon the intention to obtain the last of those laws being known, Q: Servilius Caepio, one of the Quaftors, represented, that if such a law should pass, there would.be an end to industry, good or- der and government in the city; and that the trea- fury of Rome would not be sufficient to defray the expence. He exhorted the Senate to employ every measure to defeat this ruinous project. And this body accordingly. made a resolution, that whoever attempted to obtain the law in question should be deemed an enemy to his country. But Apulieus was not to be refirained by the terrors of this re- solution. He proceeded to propose the law in the usual form, and had planted the rails and bal- loting urns for the People to give their votes, when Caepio, with a body of his attendants, had the courage to attack the Tribune, broke down the steps, and overset the balloting urns; an ac- tion for which he was afterwards impeached upon an accusation of treason, but by which, for the present, he disappointed the designs of the fadtioni.
Apuleius, to extend the power of the popular
G 3 assemblies, i Aut. de Vir is Illuftrbus in Saturn;no. i Aut. Rhetoricoramn ad Hrenniam;
c H AP. aflemblies, and to remove every obitrudion fronm
,l his own designs, brought forward a number of
new regulations. One to confirm a former fta- tute, by which the ats of the Tribes were decla- red to have the force of laws. Another, declaring it to be treason for any person to interrupt a Tri- bune in putting a queflion to the People. A third, obliging the Senate to confirm every aft of the Tribes within five days after such ad had pafled, and requiring every Senator, under pain of a fine, and of being struck off the rolls, to take an oath to abide by these regulations. While there motions were under debate, some one of the party who opposed them, in order to flop the ca- reer of this fatious Tribune, observed that it thundered; a circumstance which, upon the ordi- nary maxims of the Roman Augurs, was sufficient to suspend any business in which the People were engaged, and to break up their aflembly. " If " you be not silent," said Apuleius to. the person who observed that it thundered, " you will also " find that it hails." The assembly accordingly, without being deterred by this interposition of the auspices, passed ads to the several purposes now mentioned. The power of the Senate was thus entirely suppressed, their part of the legislature being reduced to a mere form, and even this form they were not at liberty to withhold. Marius called them together, and proposed that they should confider what resolution they were to take with refped to a change of so much importance,
and
and particularly with refpea to the oath which-c.H A P. was to be exacecl from the Senators, binding or _ obliging themselves to abide by the regulations now made. The old warrior is said, on this oc- cafion, to have pradifed an artifice by which he imposed on many of those who were present, and which afterwards furnithed him with a pretence for removing his enemy MIetellus from the coun- cils of Rtate. He declared himself with great warmth againrft taking the oath, and by his ex- ample led other Senators to express their dislike. Metellus, in particular, allured the aflembly, that it was his own resolution never to come under any such engagement.
While the Senators relied on the concurrence of Marius in refuting the oath, the time appointed for adminiftring it nearly approached; and this Consul, after the third day was far spent, assem- bled the Senate, set forth the dangerous state of the commonwealth; at the fame time expressed his own fears of the disturbances that might arise if the Senate refused to gratify the People in this matter, and while multitudes were assembled in the streets to know the iltue of their councils, he required that the oath should be adminiifred. He himself took it, to the afonifihment of the Senate, and to the joy of the populace, who, being assem- bled by Apuleius, founded applause through the streets.. Metellus alone, of all w\iho were present, refused to comply, and withflood all the intrea- ties of his friends, who represented the danger
G 4 with
H A P. with which he was threatened. " If it were al- -xmI. ", ways safe to do right," he said, " who would
"ever do wrong ? But good mlen are difinguijhed,
by choofing to do right even when it is leaJt for "theirfifety to do so."
On the following day the Tribune Saturninus entered the Senate, and, not being stopped by the negative of any of his own colleagues, the only power that could restrain him, dragged Metellus from his place, and proffered an ad of attainder and banifiment against him, for having refused the oath which was enjoined by the People. Many of the molt refpedable citizens offered their aid to defend this illustrious Senator by force, but he himself declined being the subjed of any civil commotion, and went into exile.
While the ad, which afterwards palsed for his banishment was preparing, he was heard to fay, " If the times should mend, I fliall recover my " station; if not, it is good to be absent from " hence." He fixed his abode at Smyrna, con- duded his retirement with great dignity during his exile, and probably felt as he ought, that any censure inflicted by men of a vile or profligate characer, whatever title they assumed, whether of Nobles or People, or of the State itself, was an honour.
In there tranfations elapsed the second year, in which Apuleius filled the office of Tribune; and, being favoured by a supineness of the opposite par- ty contraded in a seeming despair of the republic,
he
he prevailed yet a third time in being vested with c A P. this formidable power. To court the favour of , ' the People, he asseted to credit what was alleged concerning the birth of Equitius; and, under the name of Caius Gracchus, son of Tiberius, had this impostor associated with himself in the office of Tribune. The name of Gracchus, in this situation, awakened the memory of former hopes and of for- mer resentments. The Popular party had destined Glaucia for the Consulate, and appear to have left Marius out of their councils. This will perhaps account for the condut with which he concluded his administration in the present year.
At the elecion which followed, the intercit of the Nobles was exerted for Marcus Antonius and C. Memmius. The first was declared Consul, and the second was likely to prevail over Glaucia; when, in the midst of the crowds that were assem- bled to vote, a sudden tumult arose Memmius was beret and murdered; and the greater part of the People, alarmed at so strange an outrage, were seized with a panic, and fled.
In the night, it being known, that Glaucia, Sa- turninus, and the Qu.estor Saufeius, were together in secret conference, all the citizens who yet re- tained any regard for the commonwealth aflem- bled, in dread of what so desperate a faction might attempt. All the voices were united against Sa- turninus, the supposed author of so many difor- ders and murders. It was proposed, without de- lay, to seize his person, either living or dead: but
being
C H A r. being put upon his guard, by the appearance of a XIII. - ist Rorll so likely to break on his head, he thought
proper, with the other leaders of his party and their retainers in arms, to i'eize the Capitol, there to secure themselves, and to overawe the aflembly of the People. It was no longer to be doubted that the republic was in a fRate of war. Marius, who had fomented there troubles from aversion to the Nobles, would have remained undetermi- ned what part he mhould adt. But the Senate be- ing met, gave the usual charge to himself and his colleague to avert the danger with which the re- public was threatened; and both these officers, however much they were disposed to favour the sedition, being in this manner armed with the sword of the commonwealth, were obliged to employ it in support of the public authority. The Senators, the Knights, and all the citizens of rank repaired in arms to their standard. Antonius, Consul ele6t- ed for the following year, in order to prevent the entry of disorderly persons from the country to join the faction, was Rationed in the fiiburbs with an armed force I. The Capitol was inveited in form, and appears to have held out some days; at the end of which, in order to oblige the rebels to surrender, the pipes that supplied them with wva- ter were cut off2. This had the intended effect.

They submitted on such terms as were proposed to c H A p. them; and Marius being inclined to favour, had _X. them only confined to the hall of the Senate till farther orders. In the mean time a great party of citizens, who were in arms for the defence of their families, impatient of delay, and thinking it dangerous to spare such daring offenders, beset them instantly in their place of confinement, and put the whole to the sword '.
It was reported, though afterwards queflioned upon a solemn occasion -, that Caius Rabirius, a Senator of diftindion, having cut off the head of Apuleius, according to the manners of the times, carried it as a trophy, and had it presented for some days at all the entertainments which were given on this occasion, or at which he himself was a guest.
This was the fourth tribunitian sedition raised to a dangerous height, and quelled by the vigour and resolution of the Senate. Marius, who had been obliged to act as the infirument of Govern- ment on this occasion, saw his projects baffled, andi his credit greatly impaired. Plutarch relates, that he soon after withdrew from the city for some time, on pretence of a desire to visit the province of Asia, where his active spirit became bury in forming the project of new wars, for the conldut of which ihe

tion of affairs in peace.
Upon the suppression of this dangerous sedition, the commonwealth was restored to a slate which, compared to the late mixture of civil contention and military execution, may have deserved the name of public order. One office of Consul was U. . 652,. trill vacant; and the election proceeding without M. Anro- nius, A. disturbance, Pofthumius Albinus was joined to An- offihumius Albinus, tonius. Moit of the other eletions had also been
favourable to the Nobles; and the majority even of the Tribunes of the People recovered from the late disorders were inclined to refped the Senate and the Aristocracy, as principal supports of the commonwealth.
The firtt effed of this happy disposition was a motion to recal Metellus from banishment. In this measure two of the Tribunes, Q Pompeius Rufus and L. Porcius Cato concurred. But Ma- rius having opposed it with all his influence, and Publius Furius, another of the Tribunes, having interposed his negative, it could not at that time be carried into execution. Soon after, however, the fame motion being renewed by the Tribune Callidius, and Furius having repeated his negative, Metellus, fen of the exile, in presence of the Peo- ple, threw himself upon the ground, and, embra- cing the Tribune's knees, beseeched him not to withstand the recal of his father. The young man, from this action, afterwards acquired the Sir- namne of Pints; and the Tribune, inibolently spurn- ing this suppliant, as he lav on the ground, served
his
his cause by that act of indignity perhaps more es- c H A P. feelually than he could have done by lending a fa- XrI. vourable ear to his request. The People, ever go- verned by their present passions, were moved with tenderness and with indignation. They proceed- ed, without regard to the negative of Furius, un- der emotions of sympathy for the son, to recal the exiled father. The messenger of the republic sent to announce this ad of the People to Metellus, found him at Tralles in Lydia, among the spec- tators at a public show. When the letters were delivered to him, he continued to the end of the entertainment without breaking tne feals; by this mark of indifference, treating the favour of a dif- orderly populace with as much contempt as he had shown to their censure.
The Senate, in consequence of the distaste which all reasonable men had taken to the violence of the opposite party, having got the ascendant at Rome, were gratified, not only with the test of superiority they had gained in the recal of Metellus, but in the downfal also of some of the Tribunes who had been adcive in the late disorders. Publius Fu- rius, now become an object of general detefta- tion, fell a sacrifice to the law of Apuleius, which declared it treason to interrupt a Tribune in put- ting a question to th3 People. Being accused by Canuleius, one of his colleagues, of violating this law, he was by the populace, who arc ever car- ried by the torrent, and prompt for execution, prevented from making his defence; and, though
,
C HA P. a Tribune in office, was put to death. Decianus,
XIII. ,_ _ another of these officers, in supporting the charge
against Furius, happened to speak with regret of the death of Saturninus, a crime for which he in- curred a prosecution, and was banished . So strong was the tide of popularity now opposite to its late direction, and so fatal as precedents even to their own cause frequently are the rules by which violent men think to obtain discretionary power to themselves. The murder of Nonius was a pre- cedent to justify the execution of Apuleius, and both were followed by that of Furius. The law which had for its object the support of Apuleius in any measure of disorder or license, was now employed to support his enemies against himfell and his faction.
Amidst these triumphs of the ariftocratical par- ty, Sextus Titius, one of the Tribunes, still had the courage to move a revival of the Agrarian law of GCracchus. The proposal was acceptable in the aflembly of the People 2: And the edic was ac- cordingly pal'ed. But it was observed, that while the People were met on this business, two ravens were fighting in the air above the place of assem- bly, and the College of Augurs, on pretence of this unfavourable omen, annulled the decree 3. Titius, the author of it, was soon after condemned for having in his house the statue of Saturninus 4.

The Consul Acquilius returned from Sicily; CA P.
XIII. and having had an ovation or procession on foot _ for the reduCtion of the Sicilian slaves, was on the following year brought to trial for extortion in his province. He called no exculpatory evidence, nor deigned to court the favour of his judges. But when about to receive sentence, M. Antonius, who had pleaded his cause, tore open the vest of his client, and displayed to the court and the au- dience the scars which he bore in his breaff, and which were the marks of wounds received in the service of his country. Upon this spectacle, a sudden emotion of pity or respect decided against the former conviction of the court, and unfixed the resolution which, a few moments before, they had taken to condemn the accused.
Among the events which distinguished the Con- fulate of M. Antonius and A. Poftumius Albinus, may be reckoned the birth of Cains Julius Caesar, for whose ambition the feeds of tribunitian difor- der now sown were preparing a plentiful harvest. This birth, it is said, was ushered in with many presages and tokens of future greatness. If, in- deed, we were to believe, that Nature in this man- ner gives intimation of impending events, we mfould not be surprised that her molt ominous signs were employed to mark the birth of a per- fonage who was destined to change the whole face of the political world, and to lay Rome herself, with all the nations she had conquered, prostrate under the dominion of caprice and force, a Rfate
of
c H A r. of degradation which, by its natural effects, served XlI[.
to turn back into the lowest ebb of ignorance and meanness the tide of mental attainment which had flowed for some ages in an opposite direction. U. c. 6. Antonius and Albinus were fiicceeicd in office

it fell to the lot of Didius. Upon his arrival in the Province, Dolabella, the Proprator, set out on his return to Rome, and, for his victories in Spain, obtained a triumph. Metellus remained in the adminifiration of affairs in Italy. ?.cx Cze;- The legislation of the present year is diflin- I-a Didia.
guifhed by an ad in which both Consuls concur- red, and which is therefore marked in the title with their joint names. The Roman People had frequently experienced the defect of their forms in the manner of enacting laws. Fatious Tri- bunes had it in their power to carry motions by surprise, to include in the fame law a variety of regulations, and, by obliging the People to pass or reject the whole in one vote, frequently obtained, under the favour of tome popular clause, acs of a very dangerous tendency. To prevent this abuse, it was now enacted, upon the joint motion of the Consuls Cacilius and Didius, that every proposed law should be made public three market days be- fore it could receive the assent of the People: that all its different clauses should be separately voted: and that it should be lawful for the Peo-
ple
pie to feleE a part, if they were not inclined to C H A P. adopt the whole I. v.
This law had a salutary tendency; and, though far from sufficient to prevent a return of the late evils, it served for a time to obflrud the course of tribunitian violence: but while the source was open, any mere temporary obftrution could only tend to increase the force with which it occasion- ally burst over every impediment of law or good order that was placed in its way. And the inlcf- ficacy of measures taken upon the fuppreflion of the late dangerous sedition to eradicate the evil, ihevws the extreme difficulty with which men are led, in moit cafes, to make any great or just re- formation.
It is fomelwhat singular, that about this time, in the midfl of so much animosity of the People to the Senate and Nobles, this superior and probably more opulent class of the citizens were the patrons of au- iterity, and contended for sumptuary laws, while the popular Tribunes contended for license and the abo- lition of former restraints. " What is your liberty," said the Tribune Duronius to the People, (while he moved for a repeal of the sumptuary law of Fannius), " if you may not enjoy what is your "own; if you must; be directed by rule and " measure; if you muLf be flinted in your plea- "fures ?-Let us. ihake off, I pray you, tllfe "musty remains of antiquity, and make free to

Cn. Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Licinius Craftus being raised to the Consulate, the lat- ter was appointed to relieve Didius in Spain, and the other to succeed Metellus in Italy. There is, during some years, a considerable deficiency in the materials from which our accounts are collet- ed; little more is recorded than the succession of C6nfuls, with the number of years that elapsed, and a few particulars, that ill supply the interval, of what passed in the city, or in the series of im- portant affairs abroad.

In the present year are dated two remarkable
acls of the Senate; one to prohibit recourse to magic, another to abolifli the practice of human Ihcrifices -: the first proceeding, perhaps, from credulity in the authors of the law; the other implying some remains of a gross and inhuman superstition, which was still entertained by the People, though rejected by the Government s.

In the following Consulate the kingdom of Cy- c H AP. rend was bequeathed to the Romans by Ptolomy .--L Appion, the late king. But, as this People pro- sessed themselves to be the general patrons of li- berty, where this blessing was not forfeited by some ad of ingratitude or perfidy in their allies, they did not avail themselves of this legacy, leav- ing the fubjets of Cyrene to retain for some time the independence of their nation with a species of popular government; and in this condition they were allowed to at the part of a separate State, until, under a general arrangement refpeding all the dependencies of the Roman empire, the terri- tories of Cyrene, among the rell, were reduced to the form of a province.
The following Consuls gave its name and' its u.c. 6s.

Times of faction were extremely favourable to this intrusion of firangers. Different leaders con- nived at the enrolment of those who were likely to favour their refpedive parties. And the f'e --

C H A P. tious Tribunes, however little they may have fa-
'---' voured the general claim of the allies to be admit-
ted as Romans, fondly espoused their cause, as mat- ter of opposition to the Senate, and as likely to open a more spacious field for their own operations; as they expected to raise the storm of popular animosity and tumult with the more ease, in pro- portion as the numbers of the People increased. By the as of Licinius and Mucius, nevertheless, a scrutiny was set on foot, and all who, without a juit title, ventured to exercise any privilege of Ro- man citizens, were remitted to their several bo- roughs '.
In this Consulate is likewise dated the trial of Servilius Cxepio, for his supposed mifcondut about ten years before in his command of the army against the Cimbri. He had exasperated the po- pular faction, by opposing the at of Saturninus for the gratuitous distribution of corn, and his ene- mies were now encouraged to raise this prosecution against him. The People gave sentence of con- demnation, and violently drove from the place of assembly two of the Tribunes who ventured to in- terpofe their negative in his favour. Authors, ac- cording to Valerius Maximus, have differed in their accounts of the sequel; some affirming that Capio, being put to death in prison, his body was dragged through the streets as that of a traitor, and cafl into the river ; others, that he was, by the fa-

C. Norbanus, who was said to be author of the riot which occasioned the condemnation of Cte- pio, and the supposed cruel execution of that citi- zen, was on the following year brought to trial himself for mal-administration and sedition in of- fice; but, by his own popularity, and the address of the orator Antonius, who pleaded his cause, was acquitted '.
The war in Spain fill continued ; and the Ro- mans, having gained considerable victories, sent ten commissioners, to endeavour, in concert with Craf- sus and Didius, to make such arrangements as might tend to the future peace of those provinces: but in vain; hostilities were again renewed in the following year.

Whether his neglec of political honours, during this period, proceeded from idle- ness, or from want of ambition, is uncertain. His character will justify either conftrudion, being equally susceptible of dissipation, and of the dif- dain of ordinary dilfincions. The People, how- ever, refused to gratify him in his desire of passing on to the office xf Pri-tor without being Edile; as they were resolved to be gratified with the magni-
H 3 ficent 3 Val ,Max. lib. iv. c. l. e Ciccro :k Or:,tor. lib. ii.
c H A P. ficent shows of wild beasts, which his supposed cor-
x. refpondence with the king of Mauritania enabled
him to furnilh. But to remove this objecion to his preferment, he gave out, that as Praetor he fliould exhibit the fame shows which were expet- ed from him as Edile: and having, in the follow- ing year, perfifled in his suit, he was accordingly elcted, and fulfilled the expectations of the Peo- ple; insomuch, that he is said to have let loose in the Circus one hundred maned or male lions, and to have exhibited the method of baiting or fights ing them by Mauritanian huntfnmen'. Such was the price which candidates for preferment at Rome were obliged to pay for the suffrage of the People.
In this variable scene, where so many particular men excelled in genius and magnanimity, while meaftures of State were affected by the caprice of a disorderly multitude, P. lutilius, late Quaefor in Asia, exhibited a fpecacle more than sufficient to counterbalance the lions of Sylla; and, if it were permitted in any cafe whatever to treat our coun- try with disdain, furnifed an instance to be ap- plauded of the just contempt with which the undeserved resentments of corrupt and malicious men may be flighted. Having reformed many abuses of the equefirian tax-gatherers in the pro- vince which he governed, he was himself brought before the tribun:l of an equestrian jury, to be tried for the crime he had refrained in others.
In
In this situation he declined the aid of any friend, c H A P. told the judges he would make no defence; but v XI.- stated the particulars by which he had offended his prosecutors, left the court to decide, and, being condemned, retired to Smyrna, where he ever as- ter lived in great tranquillity, and could not be prevailed on, even by Sylla in the height of his power, to return to Rome '. Great as the State and Republic of Rome was become, unmerited disgrace was certainly a just object of contempt or indifference, to the worthy person on whom it was inflicted.
The Proconsuls, Didius and CrafTus, were per- mitted to triumph for victories obtained in Spain, but had not been able to establish the peace of that country. The conduct of the war which broke out afresh in one of the provinces was committed to Valerius Flaccus, and that of the other to Per- perna, one of the Consuls. Flaccus, near the town of Bclgida, obtained a great victory, in which were ilain about twenty thousand of the enemy; but he could not prevail on the canton to submit. Such of the People as were inclined to capitulate, having met to deliberate on terms, were beset by their fellow-citizens, and the house in which they were alTembled being set on fire, they perished in the flames.

The Prntor Sylla, at the expiration of his of- fice, was frnt into Asia with a commifflon to re- llore Ariarathes to the kingdom of Cappadocia, which had been seized by Mithridates, and to re- store Pylamenes to that of Paphlagonia, from which he had been expelled by Nicomedes king of By- thinia. The Prator having successfully executed both there commifions, continued his journey to the Euphrates, where he had a conference, and concluded a treaty with an ambafTador from Aria- rathes king of the Parthians '.
From an ediE of the Censors, Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus and C. Licinius Cralfus, condemning the schools of Latin rhetoric -, it appears that the Romans, during this period, still received with re- luctance the refinements which were gradually ta- king place in the literary as well as in the other arts. ó" Whereas information," said the Censors in their edid, '" has been lodged before us that "schools are kept by certain persons, under the " title of Latin rhetoricians, to which the youth ( of this city rctort, and at which they pals entire

L uciusMar- Julius Cefar, according to Pliny, there were in ciusPhilip- the Roman treasury sixteen hundred and twenty- liusci" eight thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine lar pondo a of gold^, or between sixty and seventy or eighty millions Sterling. In the fame year a present sent from the king of Mauritania had near- ly produced a civil war in the commonwealth, or at least inflamed the paffons from which that calamity soon after arose. Bocchus, in order to remind the Romans of the merit he had acquired by delivering Jugurtha into their hands, had cau- ied this scene to be represented in a groupe of images of gold, containing his own figure, that of Jugurtha, and that of Sylla, to whom the unhappy prince was delivered up. Marius, under whose auspices this transaction had pastcd, being provok- ed at having no place in the groupe by which it was represented, attempted to pull down the images after they had been ereced in the place of their

C H A P. destination in the Capitol. Sylla was equally so-
-licitous to have them remain; and the contest was
likely to end in violence, if matters of greater mo- ment had not arisen to occupy the ardent and ve- hement spirit of these rivals.
The expectations of all parties at Rome, and throughout Italy, were now raised by the projects of Livius Drufus, an active Tribune, who, in or- der to distinguish himself, brought forward many lubjects of the greatest concern to the public. He acted at first in concert with the leading men of the Senate, and was supported by them in order to obtain some amendment in the law as it then flood respecting the courts ofjuftice. The Equeitrian or- der had acquired exclusive possession of the judica- Lex de Ju. ture. The Senators wified to recover at least a
d l share in that prerogative; and Drufus, in order to
gratify them, moved for an ac of which the ten- dency was, to restore the Senators to their place in forming the courts ofjuftice; and to prevent opposition from the Equestrian order, he proposed, at once, to enrol three hundred knights into the Senate; and that the Senators, who appear at this time to have amounted to no more than three hundred, might not withstand this increase of their numbers, he left to each the nomination of one of the new members; proposing, that from the fix hundred so constituted, the lifts of judges hould be taken . Many of the knights were recon-

oiled to this arrangement, by the hopes of be- H AP. coming Senators; but the order, in general, seem XII. to have confidered it as a snare laid to deprive them of their consequence in the government of their country; and individuals refused to accept of a place in the Senate, at the hazard of so great and so sudden a change in the constitution of the State, and in the condition of an order from which they derived their consequence .
This Tribune likewise proposed an ad to de- LexNum. base the silver coin, by mixing an eighth of alloy. But the part of his proje&t which gave the great- eft alarm, was that which related to the indigent citizens of Rome, and to the inhabitants of Italy in general.
With a view to gratify the poorer citizens he Lex de Co.
Ioniis. proposed, that all the new settlements, projected by the law of Caius Gracchus, should now be car- ried into execution. The Consul, Marcus Per- perna, having ventured to oppose this proposal, was, by order of the Tribune, taken into custody; and so roughly treated in the execution of this order, that, while he firuggled to disengage him- self, the blood was made to spring from his no- irils. " It is no more than the pickle of the tur- :' tle-fifh I," said the Tribune, a species of deli- cacy, in which, it seems, among other luxuries of

c H A P. the table, this Consul was supposed frequently to lk- . indulge himself. tex de Ci- For the allies of Italy, Livius Drufus proposed vicate So. ciisdanda. to obtain the favourite objec on which they had
been so long intent, their admission on the rolls of Roman citizens. In all his other proposals, he had the concurrence of some party in the com- monwealth, and by.perfuaflon, or force, had ob- tained his purpose; but in this he struck at the personal consideration of every citizen, and was opposed by the general voice of the People.
This Tribune used to boast, that he would ex- hauft every fund from which any order of men could be gratified, and leave to those who came as- ter him, nothing to give but the air and the earth r, The citizens in general, however, were become tired of his favours, and the people of Italy were ill-difpofed to requite the merit of a project, which, though in their favour, he had not been able to execute.
Soon after the motion which Drufus made for this great and alarming innovation, he was fud- denly taken ill in the public alTembly, and Pa- pirius Carbo, another of the Tribunes, made a ihort speech on the occasion, which, among a people prone to fuperftiton, and ready to exe- cute whatever they conceived to be awarded by the g ds, probably hallened the fate of his fal- ling colleague: " 0 Marcus Drufus!" he said, " the father I call, not this degenerate son; thou "who ufedft to fay, The commonwealth is sacred,
"whoever 1 i ruis, lib. iii. c. I'7.
" whoever violates it is sure to be punished. The c H A P. "temerity of the son may loon evince the wisdom - : ' of the father." A great fliout arose in the as- fembly, and Drufus', being attended to his own house by a numerous multitude, received in the crowd a secret wound of which he died 2. All his laws were Loon after repealed, as having passed under unfavourable auspices. But the inhabitants of Italy were not to be appeased under their late disappointment, and discontents were breaking out in every part of the country, which threatened to end in some great convulsion.
In this slate of public alarm, some pro.fecu- tions were raised by the Tribunes, calculated merely to gratify their own private resentments, and tending at the fame time to excite extreme animofities. Q. Varius Hybrida obtained a decree of the People, directing, that inquiry should be made by whole fault the allies had been made to exped the freedom of the city. In consequence of an inquest set on foot for this purpose, L. Cal- phurnius Beftia, late Consul, and M. Aurelius Orator, and other eminent men, were condemned 3. Mummius Achaicus was banished to Delos. Emi- lius Scaurus, who had long maintained his dignity as Princeps, or firfi on the roll of the Senate, was cited on this occalion before the People as a per- Ibn involved in the fame guilt. Quintus Varius,

C H A P. the Tribune, who accused him, being a native of XIIL MI- -Spain, Scaurus was acquitted upon the following
flort defence: " Q Varius, from the banks of "the Sucro, in Spain, fays, That M. Emilius " Scaurus, firit in the roll of the Senate, has en- " couraged your fubjeds to revolt; Varius main-
tains the charge; Scaurus denies it; there is no "other evidence in this matter: choose whom you "will believe '."
The year following, Varius himself was tried, and condemned in terms of his own atd; and while these prosecutions suspended all other civil affairs, and even interrupted the measures required for the safety of the public, the inhabitants of Italy were forming dangerous combinations, and were ready to break out in adual rebellion. They were exasperated with having their suit not only refused, but in having the abettors of it at Rome confidered as criminals. They deputed commis- tioners to meet at a convenient place, to concert their measures, and were speedily advancing to the effea of some violent resolutions.
The Romans took their first suspicion of a dan- gerous design in agitation among their allies, from observing that they were exchanging hoflages among themlflves. The Proconsul Servilius, who commanded in the Picenum, having intelligence of such proceedings from Afculum, repaired thither, in order, by his pretence, to prevent any commotion;
but 7 Cicsro pro i1.. Scauro iilio. Aut. de Yirim Il;fi. ribts, c. ',. Qiinti!il in, lib. , c I . 1 . ; V iz', I . lib. iii, c. 7.
but his coming, in reality, hastened the revolt. C A P. His remonitrances and his threats made the inha----- bitants sensible that their dcfigns were known, and that the execution of them could no longer be in safety delayed. They accordingly took arms, and put to the sword the Proconsul Servilius himself, with his lieutenant, and all the Roman citizens who happened to be in the place. The alarm im- mediately spread throughout all the towns that were concerned in the plot; and, as upon a signal agreed, the Marfi, Peligni, Veftini, Marcini, Pi- centes, Ferentanae, Hirpini, Pompeiani, Venufini, Apuli, Lucani, and Samnites, took arms, and in this menacing posture, sent a joint deputation to Rome, to demand a participation in the privi- lege of citizens; of which they had, by their ser- vices, contributed so largely to increase the va- lue.
In answer to this demand they were told by the Senate, That they must discontinue their assem- blies, and renounce their pretensions; otherwise, that they muit not presume to fend any other mef- Iage to Rome.
War being thus declared, both parties prepared U. C. 66. for the contest. The allies pitched upon Corfinium cx.:ir, P. for the capital of what they denominated theLupu !s I!alian Republic: they inllpituted a Senate of five hundred members; eledted two Consuls, with other civil and military officers of Rate, to replace the political government at Rome, from which they now withldrew their allegiance. lhey mui-
c H A P. tered in separate bodies and under different lead- x .I. ers, one hundred thousand men in arms . The
Romans now found themselves in an instant brought back to the condition in which they had been about three hundred years before; reduced. to a few miles of territory round their walls, and beset with enemies more united, and more nume- rous than ever had assailed them at once on the fame ground. But their city was likewise enlar- ged, their numbers increased, and every individual excellently formed to occupy his place in the State, either as a warrior or a citizen. All of them assumed, upon this cccafion, the fagum or military dress ; and being joined by fitch of the Latins as remained in their allegiance, and by such of their colonies, from different parts of Italy, as continued to be faithful, together with some mer- cenaries from Gaul and Numidia, they assembled a force equal to that of their revolted fubjeds.
The Consuls were placed at the head of the two principal armies; Lucius Julius CLefar, in the country of the Samnites , and Rutilius, in that of the Marii 3. They had under their command the most celebrated and experienced officers of the republic; but little more is preserved to furnish an account of the war besides the names of the Romian commanders, and those of tlhe pcrfons op- posed to them. Ruilius was attended by Pom- pcius Strabo, the father of him who afterwards

bore the title of Pompey the Great; Caspio, Per- c H A P. perna, Meffala, and Caius Marius, of whom the i. last had already so often been Consul. Lucius Caesar had, in the army which he commanded, Lentulus, Didius, CraiTus, and Marcellus. They were opposed by T. Afranius, P. Ventidius, Mar- cus Egnatius, Q Pompedius, C. Papius, M. Lam- ponius, C, Judacilius, Hircus, Affinius, and Vetius Cato, at the head of the allies. The forces were similar in discipline and in arms. The Romans were likely to be inferior in numbers and in re- sources, but had the advantage in reputation, au- thority, and in the fame of their leaders, employ- ed in the highest flations, and inured to command. But so well had the allies taken their measures, and with so much animosity did they enter into a quar- rel which they had been meditating for some years, that the Romans appeared at first unequal to the contest, and were surprised and overcome in fun- dry encounters.
The detail of these operations is imperfecly re- corded; and does not furnish the materials of a relation either interesting or inftrucive. We must therefore content ourselves with little more than a lift of ations and events, together with the gene- ral result.
One of the Consuls, Lucius Cefar, in the firit operation of the war, was defeated by Vetius Cato near Efernia, and had two thousand men killed in the field. The town of Efernia was imme- diately inveRted, and some Roman officers of di-
indlion were obliged to make their efeape in the V7eI. XI. I disguise
c H A P. disguise of slaves. Two Roman cohorts were cut -L-- off at Venafrum, and that colony fell .into the
hands of the enemy. The other Consul, Rutilius, was likewise defeated by the Marfi, and fell in the field, with eight thousand men of his army. His colleague was called to the city to prefidc at the election of a successor; but being neceffirily de- tained with the army, the office continued vacant for the remainder of the campaign, while the ar, my acted under the dircdion of the late Consuls, Marius and Caepio.
The corpse of Rutilius, and of other persons of rank, being brought to the city in order to have the honours of a public funeral, seemed to spread such a gloom, as to suggest a resolution in the Se- nate, which is probably wife on all such occa- lions, that for the future the dead ihould be bu- ried where they fell.
In the mean time, Lucius Cafar obtained a vic- tory in the country of the Samnites; and the Se- nate, in order to compose the minds of the People, which in this war were agitated to an uncommon degree, as if this viEtory had suppressed the revolt, resolved, that the fagum, or military dress, fiould be laid aside . xi. c. 664. The usual time of the Consular elections being Stabo", come, Cn. Pompeius Strabo and Porcius Cato were cLP'to. named. The first gained a complete victory over
the Marfi; and, notwithstanding an obstinate de-

fence, reducedd the: city of- Afeulum, where the CHAP. first hollilities took place, and where the Romlans x had fiffered the *greatest outrage. The principal inhabitants of the place were put to death, the remainder were' fold for slaves. The other C6n- fill, Cato, was killed in an attack upon the en- trenchmlents of 'the Marfi, and although Marius and Sylla, in different quarters, had turned the fortune of the war against the allies, yet the event still continued to be. extremely doubtful.
The Umbrians, Etruscans, and inhabitants of other diftrids of Italy, who had hitherto hesitated in the choice of their party, took courage from the perseverance and success of their neighbours, and openly joined the revolt. 'Ihe more distant parts of the empire were soon likely to receive the contagion: they were already, by the obftrudion they met with in carrying supplies of provisions or revenue, fevered from the capital, and they were likely to withdraw on the first opportunity, the al- legiance which they were supposed to owe as con- quered provinces.
Mithridates, the 'king of Pontus, did not ne- gldt the occasion that was offered to him, in this diftradion of affairs in Italy ; he put all his forces inllmotion, expelled Nicomedes froln Bythiniaa and' Ariobarzones from Cappadocia, and thus himself became master of the' greater part of the LefTer Asia.
In this extremity it appeared necessary at Rome to- compose the liforders of Italy, and no longer
2 to
CHAP. to withifand the request of the allies; but the . ' .Senate had the address to make the intended con-
cessions seem to be an aft of munificence and ge- nerofity, not of weakness or fear.
The Latins, who had continued in their alle- giance, were, in consideration of their fidelity, ad- mitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens. The Umbri and Tuscans, who either had not yet declared, or who had appeared the leaf acive in the quarrel, were next comprehended; and foie other inhabitants of Italy, observing, that they were likely to obtain by fivour what they endea- voured at so great a risk to extort by force, grew remits in the war, or withdrew from the league, that they might appear to' be forward in, the ge- neral return to peace.
The Marfi, Samnites, and Lucanians, who had been the principal authors of the revolt, or who had acted with most animolity in the conduc of it, continued for some time to be excluded from the privilege to, which they aspired, and which the Romans would not be forced to bellow. But the civil war, which soon after broke out among the citizens themlelves, terminated either in the extirpation of those obstinate aliens, and in the settlement of Roman colonies in their stead, or gave them an opportunity, under favour of the party they espoused, of gaining admittance to the freedom of Rome: so that, in a few years, all the inhabitants of Italy, from the Rubicon to the
Straits
Straits of Messina, were inscribed on the rolls of CHA UP. the People, and a constitution of state, which had x' . been already overcharged by the numbers who partook of- the sovereignty, was now altogether overwvhelmed; or if this change alone w-ere not sufficient to destroy it, was not likely long to re- main without some notable or fatal reverse. As- femblies of the People, already sufficiently tumul- tuary, being now confidered as the collective bo- dy of all the Italians, were become altogether im- pr-tdicable, or for the most part could be no more than parIti tumult-s whish, for particular purpo- ies, assumed thi title, in the streets of Rome, or the contiguous fields; insomuch that when we read of the authority of the Senate being set aside by an order of the People, we may venture to con- ceive all government iifpended at 'the'fuit of the party or fadtion who had the populace of the town at their call, rather .than any regular tranfadion of slate.
Licinius Crassus and .1. uliut, Caeifr were cho- fen Censors, in order to make up the new rolls of the People. This, it is likely, was found to be a difficult and tedious work. It became necessary to scrutinize the rolls. of every fcparate borough, in order to know who were entitled to be added to the lift of Roman citizens; and this difficulty was further increased in confequcnce of a law de- vised about this time by Papirius Carbo, in which it was 'enacted, that not only the natives and an- cient denizens of Italy, but all who fliould, for the future, obtain the fieedom of any Italian borough,
I 3 if
c H A P. if they had a residence in Italy, and lodged their , x'I claim to the Praetor sixty days, should, by that
ad, become citizens of Rome 1; so that the pre- rogative of the Roman People continued to be in the gift of every separate corporation, as well as in that of the State itself.
The number of the aliens admitted on the rolls, at this mutter, is not recorded; but it was pro- bably equal to that of the ancient citizens, and might have instantly formed a very powerful and dangerous faction in the State, if effectual measures had not been taken to diminish or guard againfit the effed of their influence. For this purpose, the new citizens were not mixed promiscuously with the mass of the People, but confined to eight particular Tribes 2; and of consequence, could in- fluence only eight votes in thirty-five 3; and the ancient citizens were still possessed of -a great ma- jority. But this artifice did not long escape the attention of those who were aggrieved by it, and became, in the sequel, subjed of farther dispute.
M.eantime, while the Romans were meditating, or adtually making, this important change in the state of their commonwealth, they found leisure for mat- ters of less moment, in which they endeavoured to
provide I Cicero pro Arclia Poeta. z Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii c. 20. 3 Hillorians mention this particular, as if eight new Tribes were added to the tormer thirty five; but the continual allusion of Roman vwriters, to the numnber thirty-five, will not allow us to fuppofc any augmentation.

provide for the peace of the city, and the admini- H A P. itration ofjuftice. x--
Plautius, one of the Tribunes, obtained a new Lex Plotia law for the feledtion of judges, by which it was enacted, That each Tribe ihould.annually set apart fifteen citizens, without any diftindion of rank; and that, from the whole so named, the judges in all trials that occurred within the year Ihould be taken . This law appeared to be equitable, as it gave, with great propriety, to all the different claf- fes of men in the commonwealth, an equal right to be named of the juries ; and to every party concern- ed, an equal .chance of-being tried by his peers.
The fame Tribune likewise obtained a law for Lex Ploti the preservation of the public peace, by which it d V'. was declared capital to be seen in any place of public retort, with a weapon, or inltrument of death; to occupy any place- of strength in the city; to offer violence to the house of any person, to disturb any private company ; to interrupt any meeting of the Senate, assembly of- thei People, or court of justice. To these clauses Catulus sub- joined another, in which he. comprehended per- sons surrounding the Senate with :an armed force, or offering violence to any 'magiitrate 2

C H A . HE social war, though far from being success-
- ful on the part of the Romans, concluded
with a triumphal procefilon; and the Senate, though actually obliged to yield the point for which they contended, thought proper, under pre- tence of advantages gained on some particular oc- cafions, to eret a trophy. They singled out Pom- peius Strabo for the pageant in this ceremony; either because he had reduced Afculum, where thc rebellion first broke out, or because a victory obtained by him had most immediately preceded the peace. But the mofi remarkable circumltance
in this procession was, its being, in shew, a tri- CHAP. umph of the old citizens over the new, but in rea- XV . lity a triumph of the latter. Ventidius Baffus, be- ing a prisoner in the war, and led as such in the present triumph, was now, though in the form of a captive, in saC introduced to share in the prerogatives of a Roman; he was, in the sequel, promoted to all the honours of the State; and, in the quality of a victorious general, came to lead a procession of the fame kind with that in which he himself had made his first entry at Rome as a captive '.
Sylla, by his conduct and his successes wherever he had borne a separate command in this war, gave proof of that superior genius by which he now began to be diftinguifled. By his magna- nimity on all occasions, by his great courage in danger, by his imperious exactions from the ene- my, and by his lavish profusion to his own troops, he obtained, in a very high degree, the confidence and attachment of soldiers ; and yet in this, it is probable, that he acted merely from temper, and not from design, or with any view to the confe- quence. With so careless and lb bold a hand did this man already hold the reins of military difci- pline, that Albinus, an officer of high rank, and next in command to himself, being killed by the fol- diers in a mutiny, he treated this outrage as a trifle, faying, when the matter was reported to him, That

cH A P. the troops would atone for it when they met with
xVI. the enemy v. With great merits recently display- L. Cor.6 ed, he repaired to the city, laid claim to the Con- s-ll.-, fulate, and cwas accordingly chosen, in conjuncdion Pomp. Ru- fu, Co.. with Qlintus Pompeius Rufus.
It was thought necessary Rill to keep, a proper force under arms in Italy, until the public tran- quillity fiould be fully established. The army, which had acted under Cneius Pompeius Strabo, Consul of the: preceding year,,was destined. for this service; and Quintus Rufus was. appointed to the command of it.
The war with Mithridates, king of Pontus, how- ever, was the principal objec of attention; and this province, together with the army then lying in Campania, fell to the lot of Sylla.
The monarchy of Pontus had sprung from the ruins of the Macedonian eltabliflments in Asia; and, upon their entire suppression, was become one.of the most considerable kingdoms of the East.
:Mithridates .had inherited from his ancestors a great extent of territory, reaching in length, ac- cording to the representation of his ambassador quo- ted by Appian, twenty thousand fiadia, above two thouland miles. He himself had joined to it the kingdom of Colchis, and other provinces on the coatts of the Euxine sea. His military eftablifll- ment amounted to three hundred thousand foot, and forty thousand horse, betides auxiliaries from Thrace, and from that part of Scythia which lies

on the Meotis and the Tanais, countries over CHAP.
xlv. which he had acquired an ascendant approaching . to Sovereignty. He had pretensions likewise on the kingdoms of Bithynia and Cappadocia, which he had hitherto relinquished from deference to the Ronmans; or of which he had postponed the effect until he ihould be prepared to cope with this for- midable power. All his pretensions, indeed, like those of other monarchies or states of any deno- mination, were likely to extend with his force, and to receive no .limitation but from the defet of his power. And such were his resources, and his personal character, that if he had encountered on the fide of Europe with an enemy less able than the'Romans were to withstand his progress, it is probable that in his hands the empire of Pon- tus might have vied.with that of the greatest con- querors recorded in history.
About the time that the social war broke out in Italy, Caiflus Longinus, Manius Acquilius, and C. Oppius were, in different charaters, Rationed in the province of Asia, and had taken under their proteCtion every power in the country that was likely to oppose the king of Pontus in his progress to empire.
Nicomedes, who had been recently restored to the crown of Bithynia, made hostile incursions under the encouragement of his Roman allies, even into the kingdom of Pontus itself. And the king, having made fi-uitlefs complaints on this uibject to the Roman governors in Asia; and thinking
that
c AP.-that the diftraded state of Italy furnished him ,I. %with a favourable opportunity to flight their re-
fentnment, he sent his son Ariarathes into Cappa- docia with a force to expel Ariobarzanes, though an ally of the Romans, and to possess that king- dom. He took the field himself, and sent power- iul armies, under his generals, against Nicomedes, and his Italian confederates, who, on their part, had assembled all the force of their province and of their allies, to the amount of an hundred and twenty thousand men, in different bodies, to defend their own frontier, or to annoy their enemy.
Mithridates fell separately upon the different par- ties which were thus forming against him; and hav- ing defeated Nicomedes, and afterwards Manius, obliged the Roman officers, with their ally, to re- tire; Cafflus to Apamea, Manius towards Rhodes. and Nicomedes, to Pergamus.' His fleet, likewise, confifing of three hundred gallies, opened the pas- sage ofthe Hellespont, took all the ihips which the-Romans had stationed in thoe. straits; and' he himself soon after in person traversed Phrygia and the:'Leffer Asia, to the sea of Cilicia and Greece. In all the cities of the Lesser Asia, where the people, as usual upon a change of maifers, now openly declared their detestation of the Roman dominion, he was received with open gates. He got pofleffion of the person of Oppius, by means of the inhabitants of Laodicea, where this general had taken refuge with a body of mercenaries. These were allowed to disband; but Oppius him-
self
self was conducted as a prisoner to the head-quar- c H A P. ters of Mithridates, and, in mockery of his itate i as a Roman governor, was made to pass through the cities in his way, with his fasces or ensigns of magistracy carried before, him.
Manius Acquilius likewise fell into the hands of the enemy, was treated with similar scorn; and with a barbarity which nothing but the most cri- minal abuse of the power he lately possessed could have deserved or provoked. Being carried round the cities of Asia mounted on an ass, he was ob- liged at every place to declare, that his own ava- rice had been the cause of the wI.-r; and he was at last put to death by the pouring Js melted gold into his throat.
While Mithridates thus dverwhelmed his ene- mies, and was endeavouring to complete his con- quest of Asia by the reduction of Rhodes, he or- dered his general Archelaus to penetrate by the way of Thrace and Macedonia into Greece.
Such was the alarming state of the war, when the Romans, having scarcely appeased the troubles in Italy, appointed L. Cornelius Sylla, with fix legions that lay in Campania, to embark for Greece, in order, if possible, to ftem a torrent which no ordinary bars were likely to withstand.
But before Sylla or his colleague could depart for their provinces, disorders arose in the city, which, however secure from the approach of so- reign enemies, brought armies to battle in the
ftrePts,
c H A P. streets, and covered the pavements of Rome with ,x__ the slain.
Publius Sulpicius, Tribune of the People, with a singular boldneis and profligacy, ventured to tamper with the dangerous humours which were but ill suppressed in the event of the late troubles; and, unrestrained by the fad experience of civil wars and domestic tumults, lighted the torch anew, and kindled the former animosity of the popular and Senatorian parties. The severe measures hitherto taken by the Senate and Magistrates against the au- thors of sedition had, in some instances, been effec- tual to snatch the republic out of the hands 'of law- less men, and to suspend for a while the ruin which threatened the commonwealth; but the examples to given, instead of deterring others from a repetition of the fame crimes, appear only to have admonished the fatious leaders to take more effectual precau- tions, and to make the necessary provision of armed force before they embarked in designs against the State. They accordingly improved and refined by degrees on the measures which they successively took againrt the Senate; and when the Tribune Sulpi. cius began to act, the arrangements he made were equal to a system of formal war. This Tribune, according to Plutarch, had three thousand gladia- tors in his pay, and in despite of the law of Plau- tius, had ever at his beck a numerous compaiy of retainers, armed with daggers and other offensive' weapons; these he called his Anti-fenate; and kept in readiness to be employed in attempts,
which
vwhich he was at no pains to disguise, againif the c I A P. authority of the Senate iteclf. He moved the. l . People to recal from exile all those who had with- drawn from the city on occasion of the former dif- orders, and to admit the new citizens, and enfran- chifed slaves, to be. enrolled promiifcuoufly in all the Tribes without regard to the late wife limita- tion of the Senate's decree, by which they were reiRrided to a few. By the change which he now proposed, the citizens of least consideration might come to have a majority, or irresistible sway in the public deliberations. The Tribunes would be- come mailers in every question, and fill up the rolls of the People in the manncr that most suited their interfit.
This presumptuous inan himfclf undertook to procure the freedom of the city for every person who applied to him, and boldly received premiums in the fireets for. this prollitution of the privileges and powers of his own constituents.
The more refpedable citizens, and even the magiflrates, in vain withstood these abuses. They were overpowered by force, and frequently driven from the place of. assembly. In this extremity they had recourfc to superstition, and by multiply- ing holidays, endeavoured to flop or to diiconcer:; their antagonists. But Sull:iciu>, with his party, laid violent hands on the Confuis, in order to force them to recal these appointments. Young Pom- pey, the son of the present Consul, and fon-in-law to.Sylla, was killed in the fray. Sylla himself,
though
c HA P. though withdrawn from the tumult, feeling that xv. , he was in the power of this desperate faction, and
being impatient to get into a situation in which he could more effecually counteract their fury, chose for the present to comply with their demands I.
In the midst of there violences, the city being under an actual usurpation or tyranny, Sylla re- paired to the army in Campania, with a resolution to pursue the object of his deitination in Asia, and to leave the Tribunitian Ntorms at Rome to spend their force. But soon after his departure, it ap- peared, that Marius was no firanger to the coun- cils of Sulpicius; and that he hoped, by means of this Tribune, to gratify an ambition which out- lived the vigour of his faculties and the strength of his body. His firit object was to mortify his rival Sylla, in revoking, by a decree of the People, the appointment of the Senate, and to supersede him in the command of the army againit Mithri- dates. A decree to this purpose was accordingly with ease obtained by Sulpicius, in one of those partial conventions, which took upon them to re- present the People of Italy in the streets of Rome; and Marius, now appointed general of the army in Campania, that was destined for the Asiatic war, sent the proper officers to notify his appointment to Sylla, and to receive from him, in behalf of hi. successor, the charge of the army, and the delivery of the flores. Sylla had the address to make the troops apprehend that this change was equally
prejudicial t Plutarch. in Marit), p. :5t. edit. L din. 4to
prejudicial to them as to himself; that Marius CHAP. had his favourite legions whom he would natu- l.V. rally employ; and that the fame ad of violence, by which he had supplanted the general, would bring other officers and other men, to reap the fruits of this lucrative service in Asia. This per- fuiafion, as well as the attachment which the army already bore to their general, produced its effec ',
The officers who were charged to make knowii the appointment of Marius, on declaring their commission, found that violence could take place in the camp as well as in the city. Their orders were received with scorn. A tumult arose among the soldiers; and citizens vested with a public character, formally commissioned to communicate an order of the Roman People, and in the exercise of their duty, were slain in the camp.
In return to this outrage some relations and friends of Sylla were murdered at Rome, and such retaliations were not soon likely to end on either fide 2. Fadtion is generally blind, and does not fee the use that may be made of its own violent precedents against itself. Although Sylla is said to have hesitated, yet he was not a person likely to Ihrink from the contest, in which his private enemies, and those of the State, had engaged him. Stung with rage, and probably thinking that force would be justified in snatching the republic out of such violent hands, he proposed to the army that
VOL. II. K they 1 Appian. de Eell. Civil. lib. i. e l'h.Lar!h. isr Mariio ,F.di:, Lund. p. ,16.,
CHAP. they should march to Rome. The proposal wa3
_IV. received with joy; and the army, without any of
the scruples, or any degree of that hesitation which in adopting this measure is ascribed to their com- mander, followed where he thought proper to lead them.
On this new and dangerous appearance of things, not only Marius and Sulpicius, with the persons most obnoxious on account of the insults offered to Sylla and to other refpedable citizens, were seized with coniternation; but even the Senate and the Nobles, feeing questions of state likely to be decided by military force, were justly alarmed.
A faction, it is true, had affmned the authority of the Roman People, to violate the laws, and to overawe the State; but armies, it was thought, are dangerous tools in the quarrels of party; and no good intention on the part of their leaders, no magnanimity or moderation in the execution of their plans, can compensate the ruinous tendency of a precedent which brings force to be employed as an ordinary resource in political contests. Even the present state of the republic did not appear so desperate as to justify such a measure.
The Senate accordingly sent a deputation to Sylla with entreaties, and with commands, that he would not advance to the city. This deputation was received by him within a few miles of the gates. He heard the remonstrance that was made to him with patience, and seemed to be moved: gave orders, in the hearing of the deputies, that
the
the army should halt; sent the proper officers to c TI A P. mark out a camp, and suffered the commiflioners to return to their employers, full of the persuasion that he was to comply with their request. But in this he only meant to deceive his antagoniits; and having lulled them into a state of security, he sent a detachment close on the heels of the deputies of the Senate, with orders to seize the nearest gate, while he himself, with the whole army, speedily followed to support them.
The gate was accordingly seized. The People, in tumult, endeavoured to recover it; Marius fe- cured the Capitol, summoned every person, whe- ther freeman or slave, to repair to his fiandard and multitudes assembled, as in a military station, to form on the parade. Sylla, in the mean time, at the head of his army, ruffed through the gate, of which his vanguard, though pressed by multi- tudes by whom they were attacked, were fill in polTeflion. He was greatly annoyed from the bat- tlements and windows as he pafled, and might have been repulsed by the more numerous army of Roman citizens in the fireets, if he had not coin- manded the city to be set on fire, in order to pro- fit by the confufiori into which the People were likely to be thrown in avoiding or in extinguifl-- ing the flames. By this expedient he drove MiL- rius from all the fiations he had occupied, and obliged his adherents to disperse.
While the army was distributed in diflerent quarters of a city, deformed with recent marls of
K 2 bloodfrecd
CHAP. bloodlhed and fire, their general assembled the .xv. 0 Senate, and called on them to confider the present
state of affairs. Among the measures he suggested on this occasion, was a law by which Marius, with his son, and twelve of his faction, who had secret- ed themselves, were declared enemies of their country. This sentence was accompanied with a public injundion to seize or to kill them wherever they could be found. The reasons upon which this aft of attainder was granted, were, that they had violated the laws, and seduced the flares to desert from their masters, and to take arms against the republic r.
While the officers of justice were employed in execution of this decree, and many others were busy in search of their private enemies, thus laid at their mercy, the Tribune Sulpicius, having lted to the marimcs on the coast near Laurentum, waS dragged from thence and slain. His head, fevered from the body, as that of a traitor, who had furs pailed every leader of fation in the outrages done lo the laws and the government of his country, was exposed on one of the rostra; an example as- terwards frequently imitated, and which, though it could not enhance the evil of the times, became an additional expression of the animosity and ran- cour of parties against each other t.

Marius, upon his expulsion from Rome, retired c HA v. to his own villa at Salonium; and being unpro- vided for a longer flight, sent his son to the farm of one Mutius, a friend in the neighbourhood, to procure what might be necessary for a voyage by Lea. The young man was discovered at this place, and narrowly escaped in a waggon loaded with straw, which, the better to deceive his pursuers, he had ordered to take the road to Rome. The fa- ther fled to Ostia, and there embarked on board a vessel which was provided for him by Numerius, who had been one of his partizans in the pre- ceding disorders. Having put to tea, he was for- ced by stress of weather to Circeii, there landed in want of every neceldary, and made himself known to some herdfmnen, of whom he implored relief. Being informed of the parties that were abroad in pursuit of him, he concealed himself for the night in a neighbouring wood. Afterwards, continuing his flight by the coast, ,and on his way to the town of Mirturnae, he was alarmed at the fight of some horsemen who seemed to be in search; made for the ihore, and, with much difficulty, got on board of a boat which was passing. The persons with whom he thus took refuge resifted the threats and importunities of the pursuers to have him deliver- ed up to them, or thrown into the sea; but hav- ing rowed him to a supposed place of safety at the mouth of the L ,is, they put him on fliore, and left him to his fate. Here he firil took refuge in a cottage, afterwards under a hollow bank of the
K 3 river,
c 1- A p. river, and, last of all, on hearing the tread of the XiV . I . horfcmen, who fiill pursued him, he plunged him-
self to the chin in a marsh; but, though conceal- ed by the reeds and the depth of the water, he was discovered and dragged from thence all cover- ed with mud. He was carried to Minturnar, and doomed by the magiitrates of the place to susser, in execution of the sentence which had been de- nounced against himfPlf and his partizans at Rome. He swas, however, by some connivance, allowed to cfcape from hence, again put to sea, and, at the illand JEnaria, joined obme afrociates of his flight. Being afterwards obliged to land in Sicily for a supply of water, and being known, he narrowly e'caped with the loss of some of the crew that na- vigated his veiTel. From thence he arrived on the coait of Africa; but, being forbid the province by the Pretor Sextilius, continued to shift his abode among the islands or places of retirement on the coast '.
This adventurer was in his seventieth year when, by means of popular tumults, he made this attempt to overturn the Roman republic, and when he firove to obtain the command of an army in the buliet and mnor arduous service which the Roman empire had then to offer.

description. A Gaulish or German soldier, who c HA P. was employed at Minturne to put him to death, XI it is said, overawed by his afpecd, recoiled from the talk ; and the people of the place, as if moved by this miracle of the terrified soldier, concurred in aiding his escape'. The presence of such an exile on the ground where Carthage had flood, was supposed to increase the majesty and the me, lancholy of the scene. " Go," he said to the Lidor who brought him the orders of the Praetor to de- part, " tell him that you have seen Marius fitting ' on the ruins of Carthage 2."
The Senate, thus reflored to its authority, and, by the suppression of the late sedition, masters of the city, took the proper measures to prevent, for the future, such violations of order from being in- troduced under pretence of popular government. They resolved that no question of legislation flould be agitated in the alfembly of the Tribes 3 ; and Sylla, before he left the city, thought proper to dispatch the election of consuls for the following year, but did not employ the power, which he now poflefled, to make the choice fall on persons who were both of the senatorian party. Together with Octavius, who had the authority of the Se- nate at heart, he suffered Cinna, though of the opposite fation, to be vested with the powers of Consul, and only exadced a promiie from him not to disturb the public tranquillity; nor, in his ab-

honour'.
Having in this manner retlored the city to an appearance of peace, Sylla let out with his army for its deitination in Greece. Qiintus Rufus, the other Consul of the preceding year, at the fame time repaired to his province in the country of the Marfi, where, as has been mentioned, he was to succeed Cn. Strabo in the command of some legi- ons; but being less agreeable to these troops than his predecessor had been, the soldiers mutinied upon his arrival, and put him to death. Cn. Strabo, though iufpec-ed of having connived with them in this horrid tranfadion, was permitted to profit by it in keeping his station. So quick was the succession of crimes which distressed the republic, that one disorder escaped with impunity, under the more atrocious effects of another which followed. U. c 66. 6 When Sylla was about to depart from the city, L. Corn. Cinna. Cn. Virgilius, one of the Tribunes, moved an impeach- Coa: menrt against him for the illegal steps he had late-
ly taken. But the itate of the war with Mithri- dates was urgent, and Sylla took the benefit of the law of Memmius, by which persons named to com- mand had a privilege when going on service to decline antivering any charge which should be brought againit them, to impede their departure.
The king of Pontus, notwithstanding he had been disappo;inted in his attempt upon Rlodes, wias become mailer of the Lcfier Asia, had fixed
his
his residence at Pergamus, and employed his of- CHAP.
XIV. ficers, with numerous fleets and armies, to conti- . nue his operations in different quarters, making rapid acquisitions at once on the fide of the Scy- thian and Thracian Bosphorus in Macedonia and in Greece. His general, Archelaus, had reduced moll of the Greek islands, and was haflening to make himself master of the continent also. De- los had revolted, and had thrown off the yoke of Athens, at the time that it fell into the hands of this general. Thle king proposed to make use of it as a decoy to bring the Athenians themselves under his power. For this purpose, pretending veneration for the god to whom this island was sacred, he expressed a desire to restore it, with the treasure he had seized there, to its former condi- tion; and sent Ariftion, a native of Athens, but now an officer in his own service, with an escort of two thousand men, to deliver this treasure into the hands of the Athenians. Ariffion being, un- der this pretence, received into the Pyreaus, took pofleffion of the place, and continued to hold it, wvith the city of Athens itself, for Mithridates, who, by means of the reinforcements sent into At- tica, soon after enabled him to overrun Beotia, Achaia, and Laconia.
To these alarming encroachments on the Ro- man territory, and to the personal injuries done to fich of their generals as had fallen into his hands, Mithridates had joined a barbarous outrage, which otufcd, in the highest degree, the resentment of
the
C H A P. the Roman People. He had sent orders to all his
XIV. IV_ commanders in every town and lation in Asia, on
a day fixed, to begin a massacre of the Roman ci- tizens that were any where fettled in that country, and to publish a reward for the saves of any Ro- man who should succeed in destroying their ma- ller. This order was executed with marks of in- fult, in which the vile instruments of cruelty, for the most part, are apt to exceed their inftrudions. It is particularly mentioned, that at Ephesus, Per- gamus, and other cities of Aria, entire families, without diftindion of sex or age, infants with their parents, taking refuge in the temples, and embra- cing the altars, were dragged from thence and murdered. But the number of persons who perifil- ed in this maiTacre, if ever known, is no where mentioned '.
The resentment which was natural on this oc- cafion, together with the real danger that threat- ened the empire, fully justified the contempt with which Sylla treated the impeachment of Virgilius, and the celerity with which he left the city of Rome. Having transported to Dyrachium an army of fix legions, he took the route of Theifaly and JEtolia; and having raised in these countries con. tributions for the pay and fibfiRlence of his army he received the submission of the Beotians, who had lately been obliged to declare for Mithridates, and advanced to Athens, where Ariftion in the city, and Archelaus in the Pyrxeus, were prepared
to x Aptiar. de Eell. Mithrl'. p. 585, 586.
to make a vigorous resistance. Mithridates, who c H A P. was mailer of the sea, colleced together all the X-V. troops which he had diitributed in the islands, and ordered a great reinforcement from Asia to form an army on the fide of Beotia for the relief of Athens.
Sylla, to prevent the enemy, hastened the siege of this place. He firit made an attempt to force his way into the Pyreus by scaling the walls; but being repulsed, had recourse to the ordinary means of attack. He ereEed towers, and railing them to the height of the battlements, got upon the fame level with the besieged, and plied his mirfiles from thence. He fliook the walls with battering engines, or undermined them with galleries, and made places of arms for his men near to where he expected to open a breach. But the defence of the place was vigorous .and obstinate, and so well conducted, that he was obliged, after many fruit- less efforts, to turn the siege into a blockade, or to await the effecds of famine, by which the city began already to be pressed, and by which it was in a little time brought to the lair extremity. Those who were confined in the place, had con- fumed all the herbage, and killed all the animals that were to be found within the circuit of the walls; they were reduced to feed on the imple- ments of leather, or other materials that could be turned into fuflenance, and came at last to prey upon the carcases of the dead. The garrison was greatly diminified in numbers and of those who
remained,
CHAP remained, the greater part was dispirited and
.- weak: but Ariftion, on account of the treache-
rous mranner in which he had seized the place, ex- pecting 'for himself no 'quarter from the Roman general, fill withstood the desire of his troops to capitulate; when Sylla, knowing the weak Rate to which the besieged were reduced, made a vi- gorous effort, flormed and forced the walls with great slaughter. Ariftion, who had retired into the Acropolis, was soon afterwards taken and slain.
Archelaus, likewise greatly difireffed in ti.e Py- raeus, found means to escape by water, and leaving the post he abandoned to be occupied by Sylla. who razed its fortifications to the ground he haften- ed to join the army that was forming by order of his maRter on the fide of Thessaly.
The army of Mithridates advanced into Beotia. Every part of it was sumptuously provided with all that was necessary for subsistence or parade. There was a numerous cavalry richly caparisoned; an infantry of every description, variously armed, some to use misfile weapons, others to engage in clotl fight; a large train of armed chariots, which, be- ing winged with scythes, threatened to sweep the plains. The whole army amounted to about an hundred .and twenty thousand men. But their master, with all his ability, it appears, in the man- ner of barbarous nations, relied on the numbers of his hrft, to th neglec of its order, or.the proper conduc of its strength. Sylla was to oppose this
multitude,
multitude, with no more than thirty thousand c HA P.
XIV, men. mV,
On this inferior enemy, Archelaus continually pressed with all his forces, and endeavoured to bring on a general acion, which Sylla cautiously avoided; waiting for an opportunity that might deprive the enemy of the advantage he had in the superiority of his numbers. The armies being both in Beotia, Archelaus inadvertently took post near Cheronea, on the ascent of a steep hill that was formed into natural terraces by ledges of rocks, and which terminated at last in a peak or narrow summit. On the face of this hill he had crowded his infantry, his cavalry, and his chariots, and truited that, although the ground was unfavour- able to the operations of such an army, it was fill inaccessible, and they could not be attacked.
While the Asiatic general, therefore, believed himself secure in this position, the Roman conti- nued to observe him from the post he had fortified at a little distance; and was told by some natives of the country, that the hill which Archelaus had occupied might be ascended in his rear, and that a body of men might be conduced safely and un- observed to the summit. Upon this information Sylla formed his plan to engage the enemy, sent a powerful detachment with proper guides to seize on the heights above their encampment, while he himself advanced with his main body in front of their station, and by this means diverted their at- tention fiom what was pafling on the opposite
qua rter,
C I A P. quarter, while he hiimfelf was prepared to profit by Xlv. ,- L, any confusion which might ,be occasioned by an
alarm from thence.
The unexpected appearance of an enemy on the rear, produced the alarm that was intended, in the Asiatic camp. The impetuous descent they were ordered to make from the hill, drove all in confusion before them. The rear fell down on the front. A great uproar and tumult arose in every part. In this critical moment, Sylla, with the main body, began his attack in fiont, and soon broke into the midst of enemies, who were altogether un- prepared to receive him: or who being crowded in a narrow space, and mixed with little diftindion of separate bodies, of officers or men; and, under the disadvantage of their ground, could neither refifl nor retire. In the centre, numbers were trod un- der foot by those who pressed upon them from every fide, and perithed by violence or suffocation; or, while they endeavoured to open a way to es- cape, employed their swords against one another. Of an hundred and twenty thousand men, scarce- ly ten thousand could be assembled at Chalcis in Eubea, the place to which Archelaus directed his flight. Of the Romans, at the end of the action, only fifteen men w ere miiltng, and of theie, two returned on the dollow ing day r.
Archelau3, even after this rout of his army, be- ng till Inafter at .ea, drew supplics from A.ia and irom thle neighbouring ifilnds; and, being secure in lis retre.a in lUG -, iadlc' :reqolclent Cicenllts on the

neighbouring coasts. While Sylla cndeavoured to c H A P. cover the lands of Beotia and Attica from these Xl. incursions, Mithridates made great eflbrts to re- place his army in that country; and in a little time had transported thither eighty thousand frefli troops under Dorilaus, to whom Archelaus joined himself with those he had saved from the late dif- after. The new army of Mithridates, coniifting chiefly of cavalry, was greatly favoured by the na- ture of the ground in Beotia, which was flat and abounding in forage. Sylla, though inclined to keep the heights on which he was least exposed to the enemy's cavalry, was, in order to cover the country from which he drew his subsistence, ob- liged to descend to the plains in the neighbour- hood of Orchomenos. There he took post among the marfies, and endeavoured to fortify himself with ditches against the enemy's horse. While his works were yet unfinifled, being attacked by the Asiatic cavalry, not only the labourers, but the troops that were placed under arms to cover the workmen, were seized with a panic, and fled. Sylla, having for tome time in vain endeavoured to rally them, laid hold of an ensign, and rufled in de- fpair on the enemy. " To me," he said, " it is glo- l rious to fall in this place: but for you, if you are asked where you deferred your leader, you may "fay at Orchomlenos." Numbers who heard this reproach, returned to the charge with their gene- ral; and wherevcr they presented themfcives, ifop- ped the career of the enemy, and pitt them to

CHAP. flight. The Roman army at length recovered it- - . self in every part of the fiel.l; and Sylla, remount-
ing his horse, took the full advantage of the change of his fortune, pursued the enemy to their camp, and forced them to abandon it with great flaugh- ter.
After the loss of this second army, Mithridates appears to have despaired of his affairs in Greece: he suffered Sylla to enter into quiet possession of his winter quarters in Thefaly, and authorised Archelaus to treat of peace.
Both parties were equally inclined to a confe- rence; the king of Pontus urged by his lofies, and the Roman Proconsul by the state of affairs in Italy. There, though commanding in Greece by authori- ty from the Roman Senate, Sylla had been degra- ded, and declared a public enemy, by a formal fen- tence or resolution of the People at Rome. An officer had been sent from Italy to supersede him; and a Roman army, independent of his orders, wais actually employed in the province. Mithri- dates too, while he had futlained such losses in Greece, was pressed by the other army in Asia, under the command of Fimbria, who, with inten- tions cquallv hostile to Sylla as to Mithridates, ad- vanced with a rapid pace, reduced several towns on the coafl, and had lately made himself malter of Pergamus, where the king himself had narrow- ly escaped falling into his hands. In these cir- cumfances, a treaty was equally seasonable to both.
Sylla
Svlla had been absent from Rome about two CHAP. years, during which time, having no supplies from thence, he had supported the war by the contribu- tions which he had raised in Greece, _Etolia, and Thessaly, and with the money he had coined from the plate and treasure of the Grecian temples'. The republic, in the mean time, had been in the possession of his personal enemies, and the autho- rity of the Senate was, in a great measure, sup- pressed. For soon after his departure from Rome, his antagonist Cinna, notwithstanding the engage- ments he had come under, revived the projet of keeping the more refpedable citizens in fubjedion, under pretence of regulations enacted by the col- lective body of the People.
The designation of a party now in power was the fame with that which had distinguished the followers of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus; but the object was changed, and that which was term- ed the popular faction was itself differently com- posed. Formerly this facion consisted of the po- pulace of Rome and of the poorer citizens, oppo- fed to the noble and the rich. The objects for which they at that time contended, were the di- itribution of corn, new settlements, or the division of lands. At present the parties consisted of the inhabitants of the country towns lately admitted, or still claiming to be admitted,.on the rolls of the People of one fide, and of the Senate and ancient citizens on the other. The objec to which the former aspired, was a full and equal participation
VOL. II. L in rlutai Ch. in Slla et Luculli,
C H AP. in all the powers that belonged to the Roman
xIv .People. They were far from being satisfied with
the manner of their enrolment into a few particu- lar Tribes, and laid claim to be admitted without diftincion among the ancient citizens, and like them to have consideration and power proportioned to their numbers. In this they were supported by Cinna, who made a motion in their favour in the assembly of the People, and at the fame time propo- fed to recal Marius and the other exiles of that par- ty from their banishment. The Consul Ocdavius, with the majority of the Senate and ancient citi- zens, opposed their designs; but Cinna was likely to have a powerful support in the friends of the exiles, and in the new citizens, who flocked from every town in the country. On the day appoint- ed for the ditcuffion of this question, his parti- zans, in great numbers, took pofleflion of the place of assembly, and were observed to be armed with daggers or flort swords. Odavius was attended at his own house by a numerous company of the ancient citizens, who were armed in the fame man- ner, and waited to take such measures as the ne- ceffity of the cafe might require. Being told that the Tribunes who had forbidden the queflion were violently attacked, and likely to be driven from the place. These adherents of the Senate came forth in- to the streets, and drove their antagonists, with some bloodised, through the gates of the city.

to
to his standard. But finding it impossible within c I :, p. a city, that was occupied by his opponents, to withfiand their force, he withdrew to the country towns, and solicited supplies irom thence. .He pafled through Tibur and Praeefte to Nola, and openly implored the inhabitants to aid him agairnit their common enemies. On this occasion he was attended by Sertorius, and by iomnc other Senators who had embarked in the fame ruinous factiono Their solicitations at any other tin-: might per- haps have been fruitless; but now, to the misfor- tune of the republic, a number of armies were frill kept on foot in Italy, to finlih the remains of the social war. Cn. Strabo commanded one army in Umbria, Metellus another on the confines of Lucania and Samnium, and Appius Claudius a third in Campania. These armies consisted chiefly of indigent citizens, become soldiers of fortune, very much at the ditpofal of the leaders, in whose name they had been levied, to whom, as usual, they had sworn the military oath, and on whom they depended for the settlements and rewards which they -were taught to expect at the end of their services. Such men were inclined to take part in the cause of any faction that was likely, by the expulsion and forfeiture of any one class of the citizens, to make way for preferments and fortunes to those who were employed to expel them.
Cinna distrusted Pompey and Metellus ; but hop- ing for. a better reception from Appius Claudius, he repaired to the camp of this general, and had the
L 2 address
c H A P. address to gain the troops who were under his con- _?" mand.
5aTius Mean time the Senate, without entering into any and Meru- la- particular discussion of the guilt which Cinna had
incurred in the late tumult at Rome, found that, by having deserted his fiation, he had acually divest- ed himself of his office as Consul, and they ob- tained the election of L. Cornelius Merula, to sup- ply the vacancy which his desertion had occasioned.
Marius, being informed that one of the armies in Italy, with a Roman Conlful at its head, was pre- pared to filpport him, made hate from his exile in Africa: he landed in Tuscany, was joined by num- bers, and on his approach to Rotie had an offer of being velted with the ensigns of Proconsul. But in- tending to move commiseration or pity, he declined every privilege of a Roman citizen, until the fen- tence of attainder or banishment, which had been pronounced againit him, should be formally rever- ied. He accordingly presented himfelfto the People as he pafled, in the manner pradtifed by suppliants, with a mean habit, and in the ghastly figure, to which he was reduced by the distress of his exile; but with a countenance, fays his historian, which, being naturally stern, now rather moved terror than pity . He implored the protection of the country-towns, in whose cause he pretended to have fiflercd, and whose interests were now embarked on the lamne bottom with his own. He had many ,artizans among those who had conmpofed the le-
gion1 P'rn:t;ih.';;_ ~xio.
gions which formerly served under his own orders c H A P. Had reputation and authority, and soon assembled -J.,v a considerable force, with which, in concert with Cinna, Sertorius and Carbo, he advanced towards Rome.
These adventurers invested the city in three fe- parate divisions. Cinna and Carbo lay before it: On the Appian way, Sertorius took post on the ri- ver above, and Marius below it. The last, to pre- vent supplies from the sea, made himself master of the port of Ostia: Sertorius had sent a detach- ment to Arimiumn, to prevent any relief from the fide of Gaul.
In this extremity the Senate applied to Metel- lus, requesting that he would make any possible accommodation with such of the Italian allies as were still under arms, and haften to the relief of the city. The delays which he made in the exe- cution of there orders enabled Cinna and Marius to prevent him in gaining the allies, who at this time had it in their option to accept the privileges they claimed from either party; and, having chosen to join themselves with the popular fation, they threw their weight into that scale.
Metellus, however, advanced into Latiumn; and, being joined by the Consul Oatavius, took polt on the Alban Hill. From thence they found that the troops, being inclined to favour their enemies, de- fertcd apace. The commander himself being left with a few attendants, despaired of the cause, and
', 3 ithdrew
CHAP. wvithdrew into Africa. Oaavius found means to
. enter the city, and resumed his station
The army lately commanded by l'ompeius Stra- bo was now deprived of its general; he having been killed by lightning in his camp. And the Senate was not incliniL to repose any confidence in the men he h':i commanded. He himself had s ome time hesitated between the parties; and the troops, at his death, were till supposed undecided in t'heir choice. With so uncertain a profped of support, the Senate thinking it more safe to capi- tulate with Cinna and Marius, than to remain ex- posed to the horrors of a storm; offered to rein- ifate Cinna in the office of Consul, and to restore Marius, with the other exiles, to their condition of Roman citizens; only stipulating that they would spare the blood of their opponents, or pro- ceed in their complaints against them according to the laws of the commonwealth.
WVhile this treaty was in dependence, Marius, affecting the modesty of a person whom the law, according to his late sentence of banishment, had disqualified to take any part in the state, ob- served a fullen and obfiinate silence. Even when the terms were fettled, and the gates were laid open to himself and his followers, he refused to enter until the attainder under which he lay should be taken off, and until he were replaced in his condition as a citizen of Rome. The Peo- ple were accordingly aflembled to repeal their for- mer decree. But Marius, in the charader of a
pradi fed
pradtifed soldier, proposing to take his enemies by c H A P. surprise, did not wait for the completion of the XIV. ceremony he himself had exated. While the bal- lots were collecting, he entered the city with a band of armed men, whom he instantly employed in taking vengeance on those who had concurred in the late measures against him. Although the gates, by his orders, were secured, many of the Senators found means to withdraw. The house of Sylla was demolished, such as were reputed his friends were slain, his wife and his children narrowly escaped. Among the signals by which Marius di- reaed the execution of particular persons, it was understood that if he did not return a salute which was offered him, this was to be confidered as a warrant for immediate death. In compliance with these inftrudions, some citizens of note were laid dead at his feet. And as the meanest retainers of his party had their resentments as well as himself, and took this opportunity to indulge their passions, the city resembled a place that was taken by storm, and every quarter resounded with the cries of rage or of terror; a horrid scene, which continued without intermission during five days and five nights. The Consul Odavius was murdered in his robes of office, and in pretence of his litors; two Senators of the name of Coefar, Caius and Lu- cius; two of the name of Crafius, the father and the son, attempting to escape, but likely to be taken, fell by their own hands; Attilius Serranus, Publi- us Lentulus, C. Numitorius, and M. Babius, be-
L 4 ing
c H A P. ing murdered by persons who bore them a parti- I- -v- , cular hatred, the bodies were fastened on a hook,
and dragged by a rope through the fireets; Marcus Antonius, one of the first Roman Senators, who had betaken himself entirely or chiefly to the prac- tice of a Pleader at the bar and in the Senate, from which he is known by the name of the Orator, being discovered in a place of concealment, was killed by aflaffins sent for the purpose. The heads of the others were exposed on the rostra; that of Antonius was placed on the table of Marius, to whom the fight, from peculiar motives of envy or resentment, was singularly gratifying. Catulus, once the colleague of Marius himself in the Con- fulate, and partner in his last and most deci- live victory over the Cimbri, without question one of the most refpeaable Senators of the age, being included in the warrant for general exe- cution, had numbers to solicit for his life; but Marius, exasperated the more by this appearance of popular regard in his favour, made a short an- fwer, He must die. And this vicim, choofing to avoid by a voluntary death the insults likely to be offered to his person, having shut himself up il a close chamber, with a braier of burning char- .coal, perifled by futffocation. Merula, the Flamen Dialis, or Priest of Jupiter, whose name, without his own knowledge, had been inscribed Consul upon the degradation of Cinna, now likewise, will- ing to maintain to the last the dignity of his tRation, openzd his own arteries at the shrine of his god, sprinkling the idelc with his blood. As he
felt
felt the approach of death, he tore from his head c H A P.
XIY. the apex or crest of the order, which he bore, and, xv with which, by the maxims of his religion, he could not part while in life, but with which on his head it would have been impious, and omi- nous of evil, to have died. In observing this ceremony, he called upon those who were present to witness the exaanefs with which he performed his duty.
The horrors of this masTacre are to be imputed chiefly, if not entirely, to the fury of Marius, acing from the original asperity of his own mind, stung with animosity to every diftintion of birth, education, or manners, which marked the superior order of citizens, and now wrought up by recent lifappointments of ambition, and by his sufferings in exile, into a detestation and rancour, which no- thing short of such a scene could alsuage. In most other places, indeed, instruments would have been wanting for the execution of such a work: But at Rome were found in sufficient numbers, fu- gitive slaves, eager to avenge their own susser- ings, in the blood of their masters; parties in private quarrels; thieves, expecting plunder, in the murder of the wealthy; a populace, such as every where is capable of the wildest difor- der, when assembled in occasional tumults; but here peculiarly nursed in scenes of license, with pretensions to political importance, and even to so- vereignty, detesting the superior orders of the fate, by whom they felt themselves restrained; indigent, but looking for relief, not to their own incluftry or
lhonfit
C H A P. honest arts, but to gratuities, obtained by corruption
. or public profusion. In their very entertainments or sports, whether fights of gladiators, or baiting of wild beasts, trained to a ruthless insensibility and indifference to blood: Such men, having the example and authority of a leader, whom they had long confidered as the champion of their cause, and having the several objects of their fury at mercy, burit out into a scene of wild devastation, attend- ed with murders, rapes, and every species of out- rage, which could arise from the suspension of Go- vernment in a State, where the disorderly were found in such numbers, and the most powerful re- ftraints were neceflary.
Cinna himself, though equally bent with his as- fociate on measures to recover his power, and to restore his party, but having fewer resent- ments to gratify, was shocked with these enormi- ties, and interposed his authority to restrain them. The mandates of office being insufficient for this purpose, he had recourse to military force, and, driving all who were found in the perpetration of such crimes into places inclosed, or into the recess of squares or narrow streets, had them in great num- bers, without inquiry or diftindion, put to the sword.
Some degree of respite or calm being obtained by these means, it was proposed to resume the ap- peareance of regular Government, as far as the times could allow. The Consulate of Cinna was accordingly restored; and Marius, though without any form of eleion, airociated in the office. In such

a season of terror, there could not be any risk to c H A P. the party in recurring to the ordinary suffrage of the ^_ People; but an elecion was deemed unnecessary, and the ensigns of office were assumed without it.
Marius, though now preceded in form by the Lidors, could not return to the habits of a legal magistrate. The objects of his resentment were fill sacrificed to his fury, without any trial, and under his own infpedion. But, in the midst of cries which were occasioned by these executions, the name of Sylla, and the fame of his victories in Greece, gave continual presage of a retribution, no way likely to fall short of the provocation which was now given in the subversion of public order at Rome. And although the principal author ot these wrongs was not destined to abide the future consequences in his own pexfon, the immediate effect to him was sufficiently awful. Even the obdu- rate foul of Marius, unable to endure such a load of guilt and remorse, passed from the agitation of fury to that of terror and nocturnal fears, which gave evident signs or indications of a disordered mind. Some one, he imagined, continually found- ed in his ears the words of a poet, Horrid is the dying lion's den; and these words being applied to himself, seemed to announce his approaching dissolution. He took to the use of wine in excess, contracted a pleurisy, and died on the seventh day of his illness, in the seventeenth day of his last or seventh consulate, and in the seventieth year of his age; leaving the tools he had employed in

Z.t the forfeit of his crimes.
Livy, it appears' from the remaining epito- me of this part of his work, had made it a question, whether this celebrated personage had been most useful to his country as a soldier, or pernicious as a citizen. It has happened unfortunately for his fame, that he closed the scene of life with exam- ples of the latter kind. In what degree he retain- ed his genius or abilities cannot be known. HIis insatiable thirit of power, like. avarice in the cafe of the superannuated miser, seemed to grow with age. His hatred of the Nobles, contracted in the obscurity of his early life, remained with him as- ter he himself had laid the amplest foundations of Nobility in his own family. And he died in an at- tempt to extinguish all juit or regular government, in the blood of those who were most eminently qualified or disposed to sustain it.
Upon the death of Marius, the government re- mained in the hands of Cinna. While many of the Senators, and other citizens, obnoxious to the pre- vailing party, had taken refuge with Sylla: this general himself was declared a public enemy; his effecs were seized; his children, with their mo- ther, having narrowly escaped the pursuit of his enemies, were fled to the father in Greece. In these circumstances he made not any change in his conduct of the war, nor made any concessions to

the enenty against whom he was employed. Hec H A P.
xlv. talked familiarly every day of his intention to sup-. v. press the disorders at Rome, and to avenge the blood of his friends, but not till he had forced Mi- thridates to make reparation for the wrongs he had done to the Romans and to their allies in Asia.
Alarmed by the report of such threats, Cinna took measures to strengthen his own party; affu- med, upon the death of Marius, Valerius Flaccus as his colleague in the office of Consul; and, ha- ving afligned him the command in Asia, with two additional legions, trussed, that with this force he might obtain poflefflon of the Province, and fur- nifh to Sylla sufficient occupation beyond the li- mits of Italy.
But Flaccus, upon his arrival in Theflaly, was desertcd by part of the army he was destined to employ; and passing through Macedonia in his route to Alia with the remainder, a dispute arose between himself and his lieutenant Fimbria, which ended in the murder of the Consul, and in the succession of Fimbria to the command. So little deference or refpecd did soldiers of fortune pay, in the disorder of those unhappy times, even to the heads of a party they profefled to serve.
Fimbria, with the troops he had seduced to his itandard, after he had aTiaffinated their general, made a rapid progress in Alia, and hastened, as ,has been observcd, the resolution to which Mithri- dates was come, of applying for peace. To this llately but crafty prince, urged by the rieceffity of !his own affairs, the conjtunu!lt e appeared to be
favourable,
CHAP. favourable, when so much diffradion took place .-^. in the councils of Rome. He had experienced
the abilities of Sylla; he knew his eager desire to be gone for Italy, and to be revenged of his ene- mies ; and he expected to gain him by proffering assistance in the war he was about to wage witli the opposite party at Rome.
Upon a message from Archelaus, Sylla readily agreed to an interview in the island of Delos; and here being told, in the name of Mithridates, that he should have money, troops, and flhipping to make a descent upon Italy, provided he would en- ter into a confederacy with the king of Pontus, or join him in a war with the Romans, by whom he himself was now proscribed, Sylla, in his turn, pro- posed to Archelaus to desert Mithridates, to deliver up the fleet and army which was under his com- mand, and to rely for protedtion and reward on the faith of the Romans. They will speedily feat you, he said, on the throne of Pontus. Archelaus having rejected this proposal with horror, " And you," lhys Sylla, " the slave, or (if you prefer that title) "the friend of a barbarous tyrant, will not betray " your trust, and yet, to me, have the prefump-
tion to propose an ac of perfidy. The fields " of Chaeronea and Orchomenos should have made "you better acquainted with the character of a ; Roman."
Upon this reply Archelaus saw the necessity of purchasing the treaty he was 'inftrudted to obtain, srA1 .ccordingly made the following conceflions:
That
That the fleet of Pontus, consisting of seventy C H A P.
XIV. Galleys, ihould be delivered up to the Romans. --
That the garrisons should be withdrawn from all places which had been seized in the course of this war.
That the Roman province in Asia, together with Paphlagonia, Bithynia, and Cappadocia should be evacuated, and the frontier of Pontus, for the fu- ture, be the boundary of Mithridates's territory.
That the Romans should receive two thousand talents ', to reimburse their expence in the war.
That prisoners ihould be restored, and all de- ferters delivered up.
While these articles were sent to Mithridates for his ratification, Sylla in no degree relaxed the measures he had taken to secure and to facilitate the passage of his army into Asia. He sent Lucul- lus 2 round every fiation on the coast to procure an assemblage of shipping; and he himself, after ha- ving made some incursions into Thrace, to gratify his army with the spoil of nations who had often plundered the Roman province, continued his route to the Hellespont, but on his way he was met by the messengers of Mithridates, who in- formed him that their master agreed to all the articles proposed, except to that which related to the cession of Paphlagonia; and at the fame time made a merit of the preference he had given to Sylla in this treaty; as he might have obtain- ed more favourable terms from Fimbria. " That
is a traitor," said Sylla, " whom I small speedily
" punish x About 386,oco 1. 2 Vide Plutarch. in Lucullo.
c H A P. "' punish for his crimes. As for your master, I
xl y" ihall know, upon my descent in Asia, whether
"he choofes to have peace or war."
Being arrived at the Hellespont, he wasjoined by Lucullus with a number of veflels, which enabled him to pass the frait. Here he was met by another mefrage from Mithridates, desiring a personal inter- view; which was acdordingly held in the pretence of both armies, and at which the king of Pontus, after some expostulations, agreed to all the condi- tions already mentioned. In this he probably ated from policy, as well as from the necessity he felt in the present state of his affairs. He flill hoped, that in consequence of this treaty, he might turn the arms of Sylla against the Romans, and trufled that the peace he obtained for himself in Asia was to be the beginning of a war in Italy, more likely to distress his enemies than any efforts he himself could make against them. With this reasonable profped he retired into his own king- dom of Pontus; and there, firengthening himself by alliances and the acquisition of territory on the northern coasts of the Euxine, he prepared to take advantage of future emergencies, and to profit by the fate of confusion into which the affairs of the Romans were likely to fall.
Sylla having brought the Mithridatic war to an issue so honourable for himself, and having every where gratified his army with the spoils of their enemies, being poieifed of a considerable fum of money and a numerous fleet, and being secure of
the
the attachment of the legions, who had experiell- CH A '. ced his liberality, and refted their hopes in fu- - _V. ture on the success of his enterprize, prepared to take vengeance on his enemies, and those of the republic in Italy. He proceeded, however, with great deliberation and caution; and, as if the State at Rome were in perfec tranquillity, flaid to re- duce the army of Fimbria, to resettle the Roman province, and to effec the restoration of the aiiies, Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes, to their refpedive kingdoms of Cappadocia and Bithynia.
Fimbria being required by Sylla to resign a command which he had illegally usurpcd, retort- ed the charge of usurpation, and treated Sylla himself as an outlaw: but upon the approach of this general, being deserted by his army, he fled to Pergamus, and there had an end put to his life by the hands of a slave, of whom he exacted this service. To punish the province of Asia for its defedion to MitIlridates, Sylla obliged the inha- bitants to pay down a fum equal to five years or- dinary tax. He sent Curio to replace on their thrones the kings of Cappadocia and Bithynia, who had persevered in their alliance with Rome, and sent an account of these particulars to the Se- nate, without taking any notice of the edict by which he himself had been stripped of his com- mand, and declared an enemy'. Before he set fail, however, for Italy, he thought proper to transmit a memorial, setting forth his services and

concluding with menaces of justice against his own enemies and those of the republic, but affu- ring the citizens in general of protection and fecu- rity. This paper, being read in the Senate,. ap- peared to alarm many of the members, even those who had least to fear from the threats it contain- ed: wished for expedients to reconcile the par- ties, and to avert the evils which the republic must susser from their repeated contentions. A soothing answer was accordingly sent to the me- morial of Sylla, and earnest entreaties were made to Cinna, that he would suspend his levies until a reply could be obtained from his antagonist. u. c. 669. But Cinna, in contempt of these pacific intentions, L. Come- ius Cina took measures to sustain the war; divided the 4toi. n. fasces with Cn. Papirius Carbo, whom, without Papirius Carbo. any form of election, he assumed for his colleague
in the Consulate; and, in the partition of provin- ces, retained for himself the administration in Ita- ly, while he assigned to Carbo the command in the neighbouring Gaul. These titular magistrates, with all the adherents of their faction, betook themselves in haste to the forming of troops, and securing the fidelity of the towns within the feve- ral divisions which they had received in charge.
Carbo exacted hostages for their good behaviour from all the towns in his diftridt; but as he had not any regular authority from the Senate for this measure, he found himself unable to give it effect. To Caftricius, the chief magistrate of Placentia, a
person
perfoil of great age, who refused to comply with c H A P. his orders, " Have not I your life in my power ?" xtv. he said. " And have not I," said the other, " al- " ready had life enough ' ?'
Cinna, however, having muttered a considerable force, and intending to fiake head against Sylla in Theflaly, through which he was expected to pass in his way to Italy, was about to transport his army thither; when the troops being.averfe to embark, he himself, endeavouring to force them, was killed in a mutiny. A general disorder and anarchy pervaded the party. The election of a successor to Cinna was twice interrupted by sup- posed unfavourable presages, and Carbo remained sole Consul.
At this time an answer was received from Sylla to the proposals made by the Senate towards a recon- ciliation of parties. In this, he declared, " That ' he never could return into friendihip with per- " sons guilty of so many and such enormous " crimes. If the Roman people, however, were "pleated to grant an indemnity, he would not in- " terpofe, but should venture to affirm, that such " of the citizens as chore, in the present disorders, " to take refuge in his camp, would find them- " elves safer than in that of his enemy's." He had embarked his army at Ephesus, and in three days reached the Pyraeus, the port of Athens. Here he was taken ill of the gout, and was advi fed to use the hot baths at Adipfus; at which he

force of mind, as if divefled of all public or pri- vate distress, amused himself, in his usual way, with persons of humour, and ordinary company. His fleet, in the mean time, consisting of twelve hundred ships, coasted round the Peloponnefus, and took on board the army which had marched by Thefaly to Dyrachium. Being apprehensive that some part of the legions, upon landing in Ita- ly, and with so near a profpe&t of returning to their homes, might desert, or, trusting to their consequence in a civil war, might become difor- derly and diltrefs the inhabitants, he exaded a special oath, by which every man bound himself, upon his arrival in Italy, to abide by his colours, and to observe the ftricreft order in his march through the country. The troops, wishing to re- move all the remains of a diitruft which had fug- gefled this precaution, not.only took the oath, but made voluntary offer of a contribution towards the support of the war; and Sylla, without ac- cepting thte aid which was proffered to him, set fail with the additional confidence which this proof of attachment in the army inspired.
He had, according to Appian, five Roman le- gions, with fix thousand Italian horse, and con- fiderable levies from Macedonia and Greece, amounting in all to about sixty thousand men. With this force he landed in Italy, in the face of many different armies, each of them equal or fu- nerior in number to his own.

Norban's, as acing for the republic, commanded 'a great army in Apulia; Scipio, another on the confines of Campania. Sertorius, young Marius, with Carbo, in the quality of Proconsul, and others (as Plutarch quotes from the memoirs of Sylla) to the number of fifteen commanders, had each of them armies, amounting in all to four hundred and fifty cohorts '; but of these different bodies none attempted to dispute the landing of Sylla, nor, for some days, to interrupt his march. He according. ly continued to advance as in a friendly country, and in the midit of profound peace. The inhabi- tants of Italy, confidering the Iuperior class of the people at Rome, in whose cause now Sylla ap- peared, as averse to the claim they had made of being promifcu(ufly enrolled in the Tribes, were likely to oppose him, and to favour the fadion which had for some time prevailed in the State. To allay their fears, or to prevent their taking an active part against himself, Sylla summoned the leading men of the country towns as he pas- fed, and gave them afiurances that he would con- firm the grants which had been made to them, if they did not forfeit these and every other title.to

V. x verted the government.
On his march he was joined by Metellus Pius, who, as has been observed, after a fruitless attempt, in conjunction with the Consul OWtavius, to co- ver Rome from the attack of the elder Marius and Cinna, had withdrawn to Africa; and being for- ced irom thence by Fabius, returned into Italy. This officer being in Liguria, where he frill retain- ed the ensigns of Proconsul, had some forces on foot, and was sustaining the hopes of his party, when so great a change was made in their favour as was produced by the arrival, of an army from Greece.
Sylla was likewise, about the fame time, joined by Cneius Pompeius, son to the late Consul Pom- peius Strabo, who, though too young for any for- mal commission, had assembled a considerable bo- dy of men, and already made himself of importance in the present firuggle. Being now only aboutnine- teen years of age, he was remarked for engaging manners, and a manly aspea, which procured him a general favour and an uncommon degree of re- sped I'. This diftinaion being unsought for, was possibly felt by him as a birth-right, or gave him an early impreflion of that superiority to his fellow-citizens which he continued to bear through the whole of his life. He had served in those legions with which Cinna intended to have carried the war against Sylla into Afa or Greece; but, being av7rfe to the party, had withdrawn

when that army was about to embark, and dif- CH A P. appearing suddenly, was supposed to have been Xiv. murdered by the order of Cinna, a suspicion, which, among other circumstances, incited his fol- diers to the mutiny in which their general was killed. Sylla appears himself to have been won by the promising aspea of the young Pompey, and re- ceived him with distinguishing marks of regard.
Numbers of the Senate and Nobles, who had hitherto remained exposed at Rome to the insults of their enemies, now repaired to the camp of Sylla. The Consul Norbanus, being joined by young Marius, lay at Canufium. Sylla, while he was preparing to attack them, sent an officer with overtures of peace; these they rejeded with marks of contempt. This circumstance had an effect which Sylla perhaps foresaw or intended. It routed the indignation of his army, and, in the action which followed, had some effect in obtaining .a vitory, in which fix thousand ' of the enemy were killed, with the loss of only seventy men to ]limfelf.
Norbanus, after this defeat, retreated to Capua; and, being covered by the walls.of that place, waited the arrival of Scipio, who intended to join him with the army under his command. Sylla marched to Tianum to prevent theirjunaion; and, .on the approach of Scipio, proposed to negotiate. The leaders, with a few attendants, met between the two armies, and were nearly agreed upon
M 4 terms j Plutarch. in Syll. edit. London, p. S3.
c H A P. terms of peace; but Scipio delayed his final con-
4r sent until he should consult with Norbanus at Ca-
pua. Sertorius was accordingly dispatched to in- form Norbanus of what had passed, and hostilities were to be suspended until his return; but this meifenger, probably averse to the treaty, broke the truce, by seizing a pofl at Sueffa which had been occupied by Sylla; and the negotiation had no other effec than that of giving the troops of both armies, as well as their leaders, an opportunity of conferring together; a circumstance which, in civil wars, is always dangerous to one or other of the parties. In this cafe the popularity of Sylla prevailed; and the soldiers of his army, boafling of the wealth which they had acquired under their general, infected his enemies, and seduced them to desert their leader. Scipio was left almost alone in his camp; but Sylla, receiving the troops who deserted to him, made no attempt to seize their commander, suffered him to escape, and, with the accession of strength he had acquired by the juncdion of this army, continued his march to- wards Rome. Norbanus at the fame time evacuated Capua, and, by forced marches in a different route, arrived at the city before him.
About this time, Sertorius, who, before the war broke out, had, in the difirilution of provinces, been appointed Propretor of Spain, despairing of affairs in It;ly, in which probably he was not sus- ficicitiy consulted, repaired to his province, and determined to try what the Ikill of a Roman
leader
leader could effeat at the head of the warlike na- c H A P. tives of that country. XIV-
The chiefs of the Marian party, who remained in Italy, made efforts to collect all the forces they could at Rome. Carbo, upon hearing that the army of Scipio had been seduced to desert their leader, said, " We have to do with a lion and a t fox, of which the fox is probably the more dan- "gerous enemy of the two."
Norbanus, soon after his arrival at Rome, pro- cured an edia of the People, by which Metellus, and the others who had joined their forces with Sylla, were declared enemies to their country. A- bout the fame time a fire broke out in the Capitol, and the buildings were burnt to the ground. Va- rious suspicions were entertained of the cause; but as no party had any interest in this event, it was probably accidental, and served only to agitate the minds of the People, prone to superstition, and apt to find in every calamity alarming presages, as well as present distress.
The remainder of the season was spent by both parties in collecting their forces from every quar- ter of Italy; and the term of the Consuls il office being nearly expired, Carbo procured his own U. C.671.
C. Mariuw nomination to succeed them, and inscribed the Cn. Pap. name of a young Marius, scarcely twenty years of Carbo. age, as his colleague. This person is by some said to have been the nephew, by others the adopted ion, of the late celebrated C. Marius, whose name
had
H A P. had so long been terrible to the enemies, and at .xl X length not less so to the friends, of Rome.
At this time the Senate contented to have the plate and ornaments of the temples coined for the pay of the supposed Consular armies. The majo- rity of its members, however, notwithstanding this at of obsequiousness, were believed to favour the opposite party, and not fit to be trusted in cafe the city were attacked. In canfequence of this fufpi- cion, the whole being affembied together by orders of the Prators, Damafippus and Brutus, numbers were taken aside and put to death; of those defti- ned to die, Quintus Mucius Scaxvola, Pontifex Max- imus, flying to the temple in which he was accuf- tomed to discharge his sacred office, was killed in the porch.
The military operations of the following spring began with an obstinate fight between two confi- derable armies, one commanded by Metellus, the other by Carinas. The latter being defeated with great loss, Carbo hastened to the scene of aCtion, in order to cover the remains of the vanquished party.
In the mean time Sylla, being encamped at Se- tia, and having intelligence that the young Ma- rius was advancing against him, put his army in motion to meet him, forced him back to Sacripor- tum, near to Praenefte, where an action soon after ensued, in which Marius was defeated.
The routed army having fled in disorder to Prae- nefte, the first who arrived were received into the place but as it was apprehended that the enemy
aufo
also might enter in the tumult, the gates were CH A P. fllut, and many, being excluded, were slaughtered X'V. under the-ramparts. Marius himself escaped, by means of a rope which was let down from the battlements, and by which he was enabled to scale the walls.
In consequence of this vitory Sylla invested Praenefte; and as great numbers were thus fud- denly cooped up in a town, which was not prepa- red to fubfiil them, he had an immediate profpe& of feeing them reduced to the necessity of furren- dering at discretion. Committing the charge of a blockade for this purpose to Lucretius Offella, he himself, with part of the army, proceeded to Rome. Metellus, in a second action, had defeated the army of Carbo, and Pompey, another of the fame party near Sena; and thus the forces of Sylla be- ing victorious in every part of Italy, the city was prepared to receive their leader as soon as he mhould appear at the gates. Upon his approach the par- tizans of the opposite faction withdrew, and left him mailer of the capital.
Sylla having posted his army in the field of Mars, he himself entered the city, and calling an assem- bly of the People, delivered an harrangue, in which he imputed the disorder of the times to the injuf- tice and cruelty of. a few faaious men, who had overturned the government, and sacrificed the best blood of the republic to their ambition and to their personal resentments. He exhorted the well-dif- posed to be of good courage, and assured them th?t they Ihould soon have their freedom restored.
In
c HA P In the mean time, he gratified his own army with ,.2..' the spoils of the opposite party, declaring the effects
of all those to be forfeited who had been accef- fary to the crimes lately committed against the State. After this first specimen of his policy in the city, leaving a sufficient force to execute his orders, he hastened to Clufium, where Carbo, be- ing joined by a considerable reinforcement from Spain, was preparing to recover the metropolis, or to relieve his colleague Marius, who was reduced to great distress in Prxnefle.
The events which followed the arrival and ope- rations of Sylla in Tuscany were various, but for the most part unfavourable to Carbo, whose force, by desertion and the sword, was declining apace. The issue of the war seemed to depend on the fate of Prenefte, and the whole force of the party was therefore directed to the relief of that place. The Lucanians and Samnites, who had espoused the cause of the late Caius Marius, and who, by his favour, had obtained the promiscuous enrolment to which they aspired, apprehending immediate ruin to themselves, in the fuppreilon of a party by whom alone they had been favoured, determined to make one great effort for the relief of Prxenefte.
They were joined in Latium by a large detach- ment sent by Carbo, under Carinas and Marcius, and made an attempt to force the lines of the be- fiegers at Prxnelle, and to open the blockade of that place. But having failed in this design, they *-rned, with desperation, on the city of Rome itself,
which
which was but slightly guarded by a small detach- c H A P.
xiv. ment which had been left for that purpose. Syl- xv la being informed of their intention, with haity marches returned to the city, and found the ene- my already in possession of the suburbs, and pre- paring to force the gates.
It was about four in the afternoon when he ar- rived, after a long march. Some of his officers proposed, that the troops, being fatigued, should have a little time to repose themselves; and that, for this purpose, they should remain under cover of the walls until the following day. Sylla, how- ever, proposing, rather by his unexpected pretence, and by coming to ation at an unufual.hour, to fur- prise the enemy, gave orders for an immediate at- tack. The event for tome time was: doubtful; the wing that was led by himself was. repulsed, or did not make the impression expeced; but the other wing under Crasiss had a better fortune, put the enemy to flight, and drove them to Antermne.
The action, though thus various in the different parts of it, became, in the event, completely deci- live. Eighty thousand of the Marian party were killed in their flight, and eight thousand taken. Carbo, in despair of the cause, fled into Sicily. The troops who were blocked up in Praenefte, ha- ving no longer any hopes of relief, surrendered themselves, and the whole party was dispersed or cut off. The young Marius attempted to escape by the galleries of a mine, of which there were ma-
nly
C H A P. ny under the place I; and being prevented, killed
xlv. < - himself. His head was carried to Sylla, and by
his order exposed in the market-place. (' That
boy," he said, " ihould have learnt to row be- fore he attempted to steer !" The leader of the victorious party having now removed all impediments from his way, proceeded to retaliate on the authors of the late disorders with a force equal to the violence with which it had been provoked. About fix or eight thousand of those who were supposed to have been the bus fieft instruments of the late usurpations and mur- ders, being taken prisoners in the war, or surprised in the city, were, by his direction, ihut up in the circus, and inflantly put to death.
While this horrid scene was acting, he had ai; fembled the Senate, at a little distance, in the tem- ple of Bellona; and as many of the members then present had either favoured, or at least tamely sub- mitted to the late usurpation, he made them a speech on the state of the republic, in which he reproached them as accessary to the late difor- ders, and admonished them, for the future, to re- sped the legal government and constitution of their country. In the mkidft of these admonitions, the cries of those who were slaughtered in the cir- cus reaching their ears, the assembly was greatly alarmed, and many of the members flarted from their feats. Sylla, with a countenance fiern, but undisturbed, checked them as for an inflance of
levity. i Vid. Strabo, lib. v. p. 239.
levity. " Be composed," he said, " and aftend CH A P. "to the business for which your are called. WVhat XI . " you hear are no more than the cries of a few
wretches, who are suffering the punishment due to their crimes." From this interruption he reiumed his subjed, and continued speaking till the massacre of there unhappy viaims was com- pleted.
In a harangue which lie afterwards delivered to the People, he spoke of his own services to the republic, and of the miifdemeanour of others, in terms that itruck all who heard him with terror. ( The republic," he said (if his opinion were fol- lowed), " should be purged ; but whether it were " so or no, the injuries done to himself and his "friends ihould be punished." He accordingly ordered military execution against every person who had been acceflary to the late mafacres and usurpations; and while the sword was yet reek- ing in his hands, passed great part of his time, as usual, in mirth and dissipation with men of hu- mourous and singular charadcers. He deigned not even to inquire into the abuses that were commit- ted in the execution of his general plan. Many of the disorders which took place in the formcr maf- sacre were accordingly renewed. The persons who were employed in it, frequently indulged their own private resentment and their avarice in the choice of vitims. Among these, Cataline, then a young man, had joined the vitorious party; and plunged, with a singular impetuosity, into the midfl
of
C H AP. of a storm which now overwhelmed a part of the xlv- city. He is said, among other persons to whom
he bore an aversion, or whose effetes he intended to seize, to have murdered his own brother, with strange circumstances of cruelty and horror.
While these dreadful murders, though mixed with examples of a just execution, were perpe- trated, a young man, C. Metellus, had the courage to address himself to Sylla in the Senate, and de- fired he would make known the extent of his de- sign, and how far these executions were to be car- ried ? " We intercede not," he said, " for the con- "demned; we only entreat that you would re-
lieve out of this dreadful slate of uncertainty "all those whom in reality you mean to spare."
Sylla, without being offended at this freedom, published a lift of those he had doomed to deftruc- tion, offering a reward of two talents for the head of each, and denouncing revere penalties against every person who flould harbour or conceal them. Hence arose the pracice of publifihing lifts of the persons to be mafTcred, which under the odious name of ,Proscription, was afterwards imitated with such fatal effects in the subsequent convulsions of the State.
The present proscription, although it promised some security to all who were not comprehended in the fatal lift, opened a scene, in some refpets, more dreadful than' that which had been formerly aaed in this massacre. By the promised reward, the hands of servants were hired against their ma-
tfers
fters, and even those of children againaf their parents. c H A p. The mercenary of every denomination were en- ._y. couraged, by a great premium, to commit what be- tore only the executioners of public juflice thought themselves entitled to perform; and there followed a scene, in which human nature had full scope to exert all the evil of which it is susceptible, treach- ery, ingratitude, distrust, malice, and revenge; and would have retained no claim to our esteem or commiseration, if its character had not been re- deemed by contrary instances of fidelity, genero- lity, and courage, displayed by those who, to pre- serve their friends and benefadors, or even to pre- serve mere objects of pity, who took r-efiige under their protecion, rilked all the dangers with which the proscribed themselves were threatened.
In consequence of these measures, about five thousand persons ofconfidcration were put to death, among whom were reckoned forty Senators, and sixteen hundred of the Equestrian order.
From there beginnings the Romans had reafofi to apprehend a tyranny, more languinary perhaps than any that ever alllicded mankind. " If in the '' field you flay all wlho are fuund in arms against "you," said Catulus ', " and in the city you flay "even' the unarmed ; over whoin do you propore "to reign ?"
These reproaches Wvere by. Sylla received a3 jcfts; and the freedom and ease of his manners, is well. as the profeflions he made of regard to

c 1 x r. the commonwealth, were imputed to infcnfibility,
xv. , or to a barbarous dillimulation, which rendered
his character more odious, and the profpedt of his future intentions more terrifying.
In comparing the present with the late ufurpa- tion and massacre, men recolleted, that Marius, from his infancy, had been of a revere and inexor- able temper; that his resentments were sanguinary, and even his frowns were deadly; but that his cruel- ties were the effct of real paflions, and had the apo- logy of not being perpetrated in cold blood; that every person on whom he looked with indifference was safe; and that even when he usurped the go- vernment of the State, as soon as his personal re- fentments were gratified, the sword in his hand be- came an innocent pageant, and the mere ensign or badge of his power. But that Sylla direded a massacre in the midst of composure and ease: that as a private man he had been affable and pleasant, even noted for humanity and candour I; that the change of his temper having commenced with his exaltation, there w.ere no hopes that the issues of blood could be flopped while he was suffered to retain his power. His daring spirit, his address, his cunning, and his ascendant over the minds of men, rendered the profpcd of a deliverance, if not def- perate, extremely remote. The republic seemed to be extinguilhed for ever; and if the rage for blood seemed to abate, after the first heats of exe- cution were over, it appeared to be flayed only for
w ant : !'ik Il. in Sy'!.,
ivant of victims, not from any principle of modera- c H A P.
'IV. tion, or fentlinent of clemency.
Such was the aspcd of alfairs, and the grounds of terror conceived even by tliofe who were inno- cent of the late difordersr; but to those who lhad ieafon to fear the rcentmeent of the victor, the prospect was altogether dcfperate. Norbanus, hav- ing fled to Rhodes, received at that place an ac- count of the profcriptioijs, and, to avoid being de- livered up, killed himself. Carilo, being in Sicily, endeavoured to make his escape from thence, but was apprehended by Pompey, and killed. Thus all the ordinary offices of State were vacated by the .desertion or death of those who had filled or usurp- ed them.
Sylla had hitherto aatcd as master, without any other title than that of the fivord; and it was now thought necessary to supply the defect. He re- tired from the city, that the Senate might assemble With the more appearance of freedom. To name an Interrex was the usual expedient for reltoring the constitution; and for proceeding to elediolns in a legal form after the usual time had elapsed, or when by any accident the ordinary succession to office had been interrupted. Valerius Flaccus was named. To him Sylla gave intimation, that, to re- fettle the commonwealth, a Didtator, for an indefi- nite term, should be appointed, and made offer of his own services for this purpose. These intima- tions were received as commands. And F laccus, having afiembl)ed the People, moved for an ad to
N - veit
c H A P. vest Sylla with the title of Dictator, giving him a
_--N. discretionary power over the persons, fortunes, and
lives of all the citizens.
No example of this kind had taken place for one hundred and twenty years preceding. this date. In the former part of that period, the jealousy of the aristocracy, and in the latter part of it, the nega- tive of the Tribunes, had always prevented a mea- sure from which the parties severally apprehended some danger to themselves. It was now revived in the person of Sylla with unusual solemnity, and ratified by an acd of the People, in which they yielded up at once all their own claims to the so- vereignty, and submitted to monarchy for an in- definite time. Sylla having named Valerius Flac- cus for his lieutenant or commander of the horse, returned to the city, presenting a fight that was then unusual, a tingle person, preceded by four- and-twenty Litors, ari:ed with the axe and the rods; and the Ditator being likewise attended by a numerous military guard, it was not doubted that these ensigns of magittracy were to be employed, not for parade, but for serious execution, and were speedily to be Rained with the blood of many ci- tizens, whom the sword had spared. Unwilling to be troubled with ordinary affairs, and that the city, in all matters in which it was not necef- fary for himfeltf to interpose, might still enjoy the benefit of its ufiual forms, he directed the Peo- ple to aflemble, and to fill up the cuflomary lifts of office.
Luc:reti uq
Lucretius Offella, the officer who had command- c .I A P. ed in the reduction of Pranefte, presuming on his 2V. favour with the Didtator, and on his consequence with the army, offered himself for the Conlulate. Being commanded by Sylla.to defif, he still con- tinued his canvas, and w hile he solicited votes in the fireet, was, -by .order of the Dictator, put to death. A tumult immediately arose.; the Cen- turion, who executed this order against Offella, was seized, and, attended by a great concourse of people, was carried before the Dictator. Sylla heard the complaint with composure, told the mul- titude who crowded around him, that Offella had been slain by his orders, and that the Centurion must therefore be ,released. He then dismisscd them, with this homely but menacing apologue. "A countryman at his plough, feeling himself " troubled with vermtin, once and again made a
halt to pick-them otf his jacket; but being mo- lefted a third time, he threw the jacket, with all "its contents, into the fire. Beware," he said, " of " the fire; provoke me not a third time'." Such was the tone of a government, which, from this example, was likely to be fatal to many who had concurred in efabliflling of it, as well as to those of the opposite party.
Sylla, soon after his elevation to the state of U. c.672. Didator, proceeded to make his arrangements and Decula, to new-model the commonwealth. The army ' o.

It appears that Li:.y re-koncd fly.f-evcn legiion, EpItorn. lib. Ixx.xi:.
c IH p. appeared to have the first or preferable claim to
iV^. his attention. He accordingly proposed to reward
them by a gift of all the lands which had been forfeited by the adherents of the opposite party. Spoletum, Interamna, Prznefie, Fluentia, Nola, Sulmo, Volaterra, together with the countries of Samnium and Lucania, were depopulated to make way for the legions who had served under himself in the reduction of his enemies. In these new in- habitants of Italy, whose prosperity depended on his fafcty, he had a guard to his person, and a sure support to his power. By changing their condi- tion from that of soldiers to land-holders and pea. sants, he dispelled, at the fame time, that dange- rous cloud of military power, which he himself or his antagonilts had railed over the common- wealth, and provided for the permanency of any reformations he was to introduce into the civil efta- blifiment. The troops, from soldiers of fortune, became proprietors of land, and interested in the preservation of peace. In this manner, whatever may have been his intention in this arbitrary aft of power, so cruel to the innocent sufferers, if there were any such, the measure had an immediate tendency to terminate the public confusion. Its future consequences, in pointing out to new ar- mies, and to their ambitious leaders, a way to sup- plant their fellow-citizens in their property, and to pradtife usurpations more permanent than that of .yia, were probably not then foreseen.
The next act of the Dictator appears more en-
tirely
tirely calculated for the security of his own per- c H A P. son. A body of ten thousand slaves, lately the x. property of persons involved in the ruin of the van- quilhed party, having their freedom and the right of citizens conferred.on them, were enrolled pro- miicuoufly in all the Tribes; and as the enfran- chifed slave took the name of the person from whom he received his freedom, there new ci- tizens became an accession to the family of the Cornelii, and in every tumult were likely to be the sure partizans of Sylla, and the abetters of his power. They had received a freedom which was conneded with the permanency of his go- vernment, and foresaw, that, if the leaders of the opposite party, in whose houses they had served. should be restored, they themfeives m.uit return in- to servitude; and they accordingly became an ad- ditional security to the government which their patron was about to eftablifll.
So far the Diclator seemed to intend the fecuri- ty of his own pcrfon, and the stability of his go- vernment; but in all his fabfequent institutions, there appears an intention to restore the conftitu- tion in its legislative and judicative departments, to provide a proper supply of officers for conducting the accumulated affairs of the commonwealth, to flop the source of former disorders, and to guard a- gainll the growing depravity of the times, by cx- 'tending and securing the execution of the laws. He began with filling up the rolls of the Senate, which had been greatly reduced by the war, and
7- 4 h'
C HA' t. by the faniguinary policy of the parties who had
i__ prevailed in their turns. He augmented the num-
ber of this body to five hundred; taking the new members from the Equestrian order, but leaving the choice of them to the People. -ex deJu. The legislative power of the Senate, and the lC'II. judicative power of its members, were restored.
The law that was provided for the last of these purposes confisled of different clauses. By the first clause it was enated, that none but Senators, or those who were entitled to give their opinion in the Senate , should be put upon any jury or lift ps the judges 2. By the second it was provided, that, of the judges so placed on the roll, the par- ties ihould not be allowed to challenge or reject above three.
By a third clauss it was allowed, that judgment. in trials at law, flould be given either by secret ballot, or openly, at the option of the defendant; and, by a separate regulation, that the nomination of officers to command in the provinces, with the title of Proconsul, ihould be committed to the Senate.
During the late tribunitian usurpation, the whole legislative and executive power had, under pretence of vefling those prerogatives in the als fembly of the Tribes, been seized by the Tri- bunes. Bat Sylla rceiorcd the ancient form of as-

Tribunes to their defensive privilege of interpo- . iing by a negative against any ad of oppreflion; and he deprived them of their pretended right to propose laws, or to harangue the people. He more- over subjoined, that none but Senators could be eleted into the office of Tribune; and, to the end that no person of a fadtious ambition might choose this station, he procured it to be enated, that no one who had borne the office of Tribune could afterwards be promoted into any other rank of the magilftacy.
With refped to the offices of State, this new founder of the commonwealth revived the obfo- lete law which prohibited the re-election of any person into theConfulate, till after an interval of ten years ; and enacted, that none could be eled- ed Consul till after he had been Questor, jEdile} and Praetor. He augmented the number of Prae- tors from fix to eight ; that of Qlxeftors to twen- ty; and, to guard against the disorders which had recently afflicted the republic, declared it to be treason for any Roman officer, without the autho- rity of the Senate and People, to go beyond the limits of his own province, whether with or with- out an army, to make war, or to invade any foreign nation whatever.
He repealed the law of Domitius relating to the FleAion of priests, and restored to the college the entire choice of their own memncbers.
lHe made ievcral additions to the penri cc.e,
by
c HA P. by statutes against subornation, forgery, wilful fire, X'V. poisoning, rape, assault, extortion, and forcibly en-
tering the house of a citizen; with a statute, de- daring it criminal to be found, in places of public resort, with a deadly weapon of any kind. To all these he added a sumptuary law, of which the te- nor is not precisely known; but it appears to have regulated the expence at ordinary meals and at f, ', -4 is, and to have likewise fettled the price of provisions.
These laws were promulgated at certain inter- vals, and intermixed with the measures which -were taken to restore the peace of the empire. In order to fimfhi the remains of the civil war, Pompey had been sent into Sicily and Africa, -and C. Annius Lufcus into Spain. In this pro- -vince, Sertorius had taken arms for the 'Marian faction; but being attacked by the forces of Syl- la, and ill supported at first by the natives of Spain, he fled into Africa. From thence, hearing that the Lufitanians were disposed to take arms against the reigning party at Rome, he repassed the sea, put himself at their head, and in this situation was able, for some years, to find occupation for the arms of the republic, and for its moit experienced comnanders.
Soon after the departure of Svlla from Aria, .MIrcna, whom he had left to commnand in that provilncc, isounct a pretcnce to renew the w ar with Mithridates; and, having ventured to patl the
Halys,,
Halys, was defeated by that prince, and afterwards c H A P. arraigned as having infringed the late treaty of xV., peace. This accusation was favourably received at Rome; the conduct of Murena censured, and first A. Gabinius, and afterwards Minucius Ther- mus, were lent to supersede him in the province.
Mean time Sylla, with all his disdain of personal diftindion exhibited a triumph on account of his vi('ories in Alia and Greece. Processions were continued for two days. On the first, he deposited in the treasury fifteen thousand pondo of gold x, and an hundred and fifteen thousand pondo of fil- ver 2; on the second day, thirteen thousand pondo of gold 3, and seven thousand pondo of silver 4. There was nothing that had any reference to his victory in the civil war, except a numerous train of Senators, and other citizens of rank, who, having retorted to his camp for protection, had been re- flored by him to their estates and their dignities, and now followed his chariot, calling him Father, and the Deliverer of his Country.
Upon the return of the elections, Sylla was U. c. 673.

Cmecil. Pye- Metellus. The latter was defiined, at the expir- tell. Pius. tion of his office, to command against Sertorius in Spain. Sylla himielf still retained the Didtatorial power, and was employed in promulgating some of the acts of which the chief have been mentioned.

CHAP. Pompey having, in the preceding year, by the
. death of Carbo, and the dispersion of his party,
finiihed the remains of the civil war in Sicily, was now ordered by the Senate to transport his army into Africa. There Domitius, a leader of the oppo- iite fairion, had ereaced his standard, affembled'fome remains of the vanquished party, and received all the fugitives who crowded for refuge to his camp. Pompey accordingly being to depart from Sicily, leaving the command of that island to Memmius, and embarked his army, consisting of fix legions, in two divisions; of which one landed at Utica, the other in the bay of Carthage. Having soon after come to an engagement with Domitius, who had been joined by Jarbas, an African prince, he obtain- ed a complete victlory over their united forces, and pursuing his advantage, penetrated, without any refiitance, into the kingdom of Numidia, which, though dependant on the Romans, had not yet been reduced to the form of a province.
The war being ended in this quarter, Sylla thkougght proper to supersede Pompey in the pro- vince, and ordered him to disband his army, re- serving only one legion, with which he was to wait for his fuccefor. The troops were greatly incensed at this order; and, thinking themselves equally entitled to settlements with the legions who were lately provided for in Italy, refuted to lay down their arms. They earnestly entreated their gene- ral to embark for Rome, where they promised to make him maflcr of the government. This young
lmap,
man, with a moderation which he continued to CHAP support in the height of his ambition, withstood ' the temptation, and declared to the army, that, if they persisted in their purpose, he must certainly die by his own hands; that he would not do vio- lence to the government of his country, nor be the objet or pretence of a civil war. From this con- dudt we have reason to conclude that, if in reality he had encouraged the mutiny, it was only that he might thus have the honour of reclaiming the soldiers, and of rejeding their offer. The ambi- tion of this singular person, as will appear from many passages of his life, led him to aim at con- iideration more than power.
While Pompey was endeavouring to bring the troops to their duty, a report was carried to Rome, that he had actually revolted, and was preparing, with his army, to make a descent upon Italy. " It appears to be my fate," said Sylla, " in my "old age, to fight with boys ;" and he was about to recal the veterans to his standard, when the truth was made known, and the part which Pom- pey had acted was properly :.represented. The merit of this young man on that occasion was the greater, that he himself was unwilling to disband the army before they ihould return to Italy to at- tend a triumph, which he hoped to obtain ; and that the resolution he took to comply with his or- ders, proceeded from refped to the Senate, and deference to the authority of the State.
Sylla,
C H A P. Sylla, won by the behaviour of Pompey on this xiv. occalion, was inclined to difpenfc with his former
commands, and accordingly moved in the affnm- bly of the People, that the legions serving in As- rica might return with their arms-into Italy.
This motion was opposed by C. Herennius, Tri- bune of the People, who ventured to employ the prerogative of his office, however impaired, againil the power of the Didator. But Sylla persisted; obtained a law to authorise Pompey to enter with his army into Italy; and when he drew near the city, went forth with a numerous body of the Se- nate to receive him. On this occasion, it is said, that, by calling him the Great Pompey, Sylla fix- ed a designation upon him, which, in the Roman way of distinguishing persons by casual additions, whether of contempt or refpe&, continued to fur- nifh him with a title for life. The times were wretched when armies stated themselves in the commonwealth as the partizans of a leader, and when the leader, by not making war on his coun- try, was supposed to have laid up a store of merit.
Pompey, upon this occasion, laid claim to a tri- umph. Sylla at firit opposed it as being contra- ry to the rule and order of the commonwealth, which reserved this honour for persons who had attained to the rank either of Consul or Praetor; but he afterwards complied, being struck, it is said, with a mutinous faying of this aspiring young man, bidding him recolled, that there were more per-
ions
,ons disposed to wcrfhip the pifing than the setting c I A 1p. 11 XIV.
In the triumph which Pompey accordingly ob- tained, he incant to have entered the city on a car- riage drawn by elephants; but these animals could not pass abreait through the gates. His donation to the troops falling short of their expedation, and they having murmured, and even threatened to mu- tiny, he said, the fear of losing his triumph flould not affect him ; that he would irntantly diband the legions, rather than comply with their unrea- fonable demands. This check, given to the pre-- fumption of the army by an officer so young and so aspiring, gave a general fatisi&'Cion. P. Servi- lius, a Senator of advanced age, said, upon this eccafion, " That the young man hlad at lait defer- ' ved his triumph and his title." Pompey, by his vanity in demanding a triumph contrary to the eftablifled order of the common- wealth, had impaired the lustre of his former ac- tions ; by this last acd of magnanimity, in refirain- ing the insolence of the troops, he forfeited the as- fedtions of the army; and in both theie circum- flances together, gave a complete fpecimcn and image of his whole life. WVith too much rfpel for the republic to employ violent means for its ruin, he was poflefl'ed by a vanity and a jealousy of his own personal consideration, which, in de- tail, perpetually led him to undermine its founda- tions.
Uto):
C H A P. Upon the return of-the elections, Sylla was again _, v. destined for one of the Consuls; but he declined U. C. 674. . Servili- this piece of flattery, and dire&ed the choice to Cladius. fhll on P. Servilius and Appius Claudius. Soon
after these magistrates entered on the discharge of their trull; the Dictator appeared, as usual, in the Forum, attended by twenty-four Lictors; but, in- stead of proceeding to any exercise of his power, made a formal resignation of it, difmiifed his Lic- tors, and, having declared to the People, that, if any one had matter of charge against him, he was ready to answer it, continued to walk in the streets in the character of a private man, and afterwards retired to his villa near Cumae, where he exerci- fed himself in hunting ', and other country amuse- ments.
This resignation, it must be confefled, throws a new light on the character of Sylla, and removes him far from the herd of common usurpers, who lacrifice their fellow-creatures merely to their own lulf of dominion. The sacrifices he made, mlock- ing as they were to the feelings of humanity, now appear to have been offered at the filrine of public order, to provide for the future peace to his country. His ruling passion appears to have been disdain of what the vulgar admire, whe- ther diftintion or power. When tired of youth- ful purflits, he sued for preferment, but with to little animosity or jealousy of competition, that if he had not been hurried by extreme provoca-
tio(l i Appjian, Bell. C il b.i.
tion into the violent course he pursued; it is pro- c H A P. bable that he never would have been heard of, XIV. but upon the roll' of Consuls, or the record of his triumphs, and would have disdained any en- croachment-on the right of his fellow-citizens as much as he resented the encroachments which were made on his own.
In his first attack of the city with a military force, his whole ation ihowed, that he meant to rescue the Republic from the usurpation of Ma- rius, not to usurp the Government for-himfelf. At his return into Italy from the Mithridatic war, the itate 6f parties already engaged in hostilities, and the violence done to the Republic by those who pretended to govern it, will abundantly jufiify his having had recourse to arms.
During the Ihort period in which he retained his power of Dictator, without neglecting precautions for the security of his own person in the retire- ment he was meditating, he took the measures al- ready mentioned, to tear up the roots of future dif- 'order, and effect some reform in the State: but as the palt had flown, what are the evils to which an overgrown and corrupted Republic is exposed; so the corrections he attempted, although they served to prolong the itruggles of virtuous men for the preservation of their country, yet were not sus- ficient to prevent its ruin.
For some particulars of his description, which have not entered into the preceding narration, it may be observed, that he was among the few Ro-
VOL. II. 0 mans
C H A P. mIans of his time who made any considerable ad- XIV. '- .' vance in literary studies; and that he wrote me-
moirs of his own life, continued to within a few days of his death, often quoted by Plutarch. That he nevertheless appeared superior to the reputation of his. own most splendid performances, and from simplicity or disdain, mixed perhaps with fuperfli- tion, not from asseted modesty, attributed his fuc- cess to good fortune or to the favour of the gods; so much, that while he bestowed on Pompey the ti- tle of Great, he himself was content with that of the Fortunate '.
With refped to such a personage, circumstances of a trivial nature become fubjets of attention. His hair and eyes, it is said, were of a light co- lour, his complexion fair, and his countenance blotched. He was, by the most probable accounts, four years old at the time of the sedition of Ti- berius Gracchus, and seventeen at the death of Caius, the younger brother of Tiberius; so that he might have perceived at this date the effect of tribunitian disorders, and taken the impressions from which he aded againit them. He served the office of Quaefior under Marius in Africa at thir- ty-one; was Consul for the firit time at forty-nine or fifty 2; was Didator at fifty-fix; resigned when turned of fifty-eight; and died yet under sixty, in the year which followed that of his refigna- tion.
There remained in the city, at his death, a nu-
merous I Felix. 2 Vel. Pater. lib. ii. c. 17.
mnerous body of new citizens, who having been c A P. manumifed by his order, bore his name: in the XIV. country a frill more numerous body of veteran of- ficers and soldiers, who held estates by his gift: numbers throughout the empire, who owed their safety to his protection, and who ascribed the ex- iRtence of the commonwealth itself to the exer- tions of his great ability and courage: numbers who, although they were offended with the severe and bloody exercise of his power, yet admired the magnanimity of his resignation.
When he was no longer an object of flattery, his corpse was carried in procession through Italy at the public expence. The fasces, and every other ensign of honour, were restored to the dead. A- bove two thousand golden crowns were fabricated in haste, by order of the towns and provinces he had protected, or of the private persons he had preserved, to testify their veneration for his memo- ry. Roman matrons, whom it might be expeced his cruelties would have affected with horror, loft every other sentiment in that of admiration, crowd- ed to his funeral, and heaped the pile with per- fumes . His obsequies were performed in the Cam- pus Martius. The tomb was marked by his own directions with a charaderiftical inscription, to the following effet : " Here lies Sylla, who never "was outdone in good offices by his friend, nor in " ads of hostility by his enemy '."

P 'HE public was so much occupied with the %----. t contest of Sylla and his antagonists, that little
else is recorded of the period in which it took place. Writers have not given us any diftinet account of the condition of the city, or of the number of citi- zens. As the State was divided into two principal fations, the office of Censor was become too im- portant for either party to entrust it with their op- ponents, or even in neutral hands. The leaders of every facion, in their turn, made up the rolls of the People, and disposed, at their pleasure, of the equestrian and senatorian dignities.
At
At a survey of the city, which is mentioned by c H A P. Livy', preceding the admission of the Italians, the number of citizens was three hundred and ninety-four thousand three hundred and thirty-fix. At another fuivey, which followed soon after that event, they amounted, according to Eusebius, to four hundred and fixty-three thousand2; and it seems that the whole accession of citizens from the country made no more than fixty-eight thousand fix hundred and fixty-four. The great slaughter of Romans and Italians, in which it is said that three hundred thousand men were killed, preced- ing the last of these musters, and the difficulty of making complete and accurate lifts when the citi- zens were so much dispersed, will account for the feemilngly small increase of their numbers.
In this period were born, and began to enter on the scene of public affairs, those persons whose conduct was now to determine the fate of the Re- public. Pompey had already diftinguihed him- self, and stood high in the public esteem. He had been educated in the camp of his father, and, by accident, at a very early age, or before he had attained to any of the ordinary civil or political preferments, commanded an army. Cicero, being of the fame age, began to be diftinguifled at the bar. He pleaded, in the second consulate of Sylla, the cause of Roscius Amerinus, and having oc- cafion to censure the actions of Chryfogonus and

Caius Caesar, now connected with the family of Cinna, whose daughter he had married, and being nearly related to the elder Marius, who had mar- ried his aunt, narrowly escaped the sword of the pre- vailing party. Being commanded to separate from his wife, he retained her in defiance of this order, and for his contumacy was put in the lift of the proscribed. He was saved, however, by the in- terceffion of common friends, whose request in his favour Sylla granted, with that memorable faying, " Beware of him: there is many a Ma- " rius in the person of that young man." A cir- cumfiance which marked at once the penetration of Sylla, and the early appearances of an extraor- dinary charadcer in Cafar.
Marcus Porcius, afterwards named Cato of Uti- ca, was about three years younger than Caesar, and being early an orphan, was educated in the house of an uncle, Livius Drufus. While yet a child, listening to the conversation of the times, he learn- ed that the pretensions of the Italian allies, then in agitation, were dangerous to the Roman Rate. Pompedius Silo, who managed the claim for the Italians, amusing himself with the young Cato, pressed him with caresses to intercede with his uncle in their behalf; and, finding that he was not to be won by flattery, next tried in vain to intimidate by threatening to throw him from the window. " If this were a man," he said, " I
" believe
" believe we ihould obtain no such favour." In c H A P.
xv. -the height of Sylla's military executions, when _, ' his portico was crowded with persons who brought the heads of the proscribed to be exchanged for the reward which had been published, Cato being carried by his tutor to pay his court, asked, "if no · one hated this man enough to kill him ?" "yes, "but they fear him still more than they hate him." (' Then give me a sword," said the boy, " and I " will kill him." Such were the early indications of characters which afterwards became so confpi- cuous in the commonwealth.
With the unprececdnted degradation of the Tribune Odavius, and the subsequent murder of Tiberius Gracchus, began, among the parties at Rome, a scene of injuries and retaliations, with alternate periods of anarchy and violent ufurpa- tion, which mufft have speedily ended in the ruin of the commonwealth, if the sword had not passed at last into hands which employed it for the refto- ration of public order, as well as for the avenging of private wrongs.
It is indeed probable, that none of the parties in these horrid scenes had a deliberate intention to subvert the government, but all of them treated the forms of the commonwealth with too little re- fpeat; and, to obtain some revenge of the wrongs which they themselves apprehended or endured, did not scruple in their turn to violate the laws of their country. But to those who wished to pre- serve the commonwealth, the experience of fifty
0 4 years
c H A P. years was now sufficient to filow, that attempts to
XV. ·.. , restore the laws by illegal methods, and to termi-
nate aninofities by retorted injuries and provoca- tions were extremely vain. The excess of the evil had a tendency to exhaust its source, and parties began to nauteate the draught of which they had been made to drink so largely. There were, neverthelelf, some dregs in the bottom of the cup, and the supplies of faction which were brought by the riling generation, were of a mix- ture more dangeious than thole of the former age. The example of Sylla, who made himself lord of the commonwealth by means of a military force, and the security with which he held his utfrpa- tion during pleasure, had a more powerful effect in exciting the thirst of dominion, than the poli- tical uses which he made of his power, or his magnanimity in resigning it. had to restrain or to correct the efflcts of that dangerous precedent. Adventurers accordingly arose, who, without pro- vocation, and equally inditlerent to the interels of party as they were to those of the republic, pro- ceeded, with a ;cool and deliberate purpose, to gratify their own ambition and avarice, by sub- verting the government of their country. v. C. 675. While Sylla was yet alive, Emnilius Lepidus, a /'4 .1r. Le- pida, Q. man of profligate ambition, but of mean capacity, Lot. Catulus, Co;S. supported by the remains of the popular faction,
flood for the Consulate, and was chosen, together with Q. Lutatius Catulus, the son of him who, w.ith Marius, triumphed for their joint vidory
over
over the Cimbri, and who afterwards perilhed by CHAP.
XV. the orders of that usurper.
Pompey had openly joined the popular fation in support of Lepidus, and was told upon that oc- cafion by Sylla, that he was stirring the embers of a fire which would in the end consume the Re- public. After the death of Sylla, from a mark of disapprobation well known to the Romans, that of not being mentioned in his will, it appeared that Pompey had loft his esteem. In opposition to Le- pidus, however, and others, who wished to insult the memory of Sylla, this prudent young man was among the first in recommending and performing the honours that were paid to his remains.
Lepidus, upon his accession to the Consulate, moved for a recal of the proscribed exiles, a refti- tution of the forfeited lands, and a repeal of all the ordinances of the late Dictator. This motion was formally opposed by Catulus; and there en- sued between the two Consuls a debate which di. vided the city. But the party of the Senate pre- vailed to have the motion rejected.
In the allotment of provinces the Transalpine Gaul had fallen to Lepidus; and, upon his mo- tion being rejected in the assembly of the People, although it had been some time the practice for Consuls to remain at Rome during their continu- ance in office, he prepared to leave the city, in or- der to take ponfeffion of his province. This refo- lution, as it implied great impatience to be at the head of an army, gave some jealousy to the Se-
nate,
CH A P. nate, who dreaded the designs of a Consul defi-
XV.
' rous to join military power with his civil autho-
rity. They recolleced the progress of sedition which began with the Gracchi and Apuleius raif- ing popular tumults, and ended with Marius and Sylla leading Consular armies into the city, and fighting their battles in the streets. And in this point the decisive spirit of Sylla, although it may have snatched the commonwealth from the flames by which it began to be consumed, yet Ihowed the way to its ruin in the means which he em- ployed to preserve it . The Senators were will- ing that Lepidus Ihould depart from the city; but they had the precaution to exa& from him an oath, that he should not disturb the public peace. This oath, to avoid the appearance of any parti- cular distrust of the person for whom it was pro- jeaed, they likewise administered to his colleague 2.
Lepidus, notwithstanding his oath, being arriv- ed in his province, made preparations for war; and, thinking that his faith was pledged only while he was Consul, determined to remain in Gaul at the head of his forces until his term in office expired. The Senate, in order to remove him from the army he had raised, appointed him to preside at the election of his successor. But he negleced the summons which was sent to him for this purpose, and the year of the present Consuls
was i Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. i, a Ibid,
was by this means suffered to elapse, before any CHAP. election was made. x
The ordinary fucceflion being thus interrupted, the Senate named Appius Claudius, as Interrex, to hold the elections, and at the fame time depriv- ed Lepidus of his command in Gaul. Upon this information he hastened to Italy with the troops he had already assembled, and greatly alarmed the republic. The Senate gave to Appius Claudius, and to Catulus, in the quality of Proconsul, the usual charge to watch over the safety of the State. These officers accordingly, without delay, collec- ted a military force, while Lepidus advanced through Etruria, and published a manifesto, in which he invited all the friends of liberty to join him, and made a formal demand of being re-in- vested with the consular power. In opposition to this treasonable ad of Lepidus, the Senate repu- blifhed the law of Plautius, by which the Prators were required, in the ordinary course of justice, to take cognizance of all attemps to levy war against the republic, and joined to it an addition- al clause or resolution of their own, obliging those magistrates to receive accusations of treason on holy-days, as well as on ordinary days of business.
Mean time Lepidus advanced to the very gates of Rome, seized the Janiculum and one of the bridges. But in his farther attempt to force the city, was met by Catulus, repulsed and routed. All his party dispersed; he himself fled to Sardinia, and soon after died. His son, a young man, with part of
the
C HAP the army, retired to Alba, was there soon after
taken, and suffered for a treason in which he had been engaged by his father.
Marcus Brutus, the father of him who, in the continuation of these troubles, afterwards fell at Philippi, having joined with Lepidus in this rafil and profligate attempt against the republic, was obliged at Mantua to surrender himself to Pom- pey, and, by his order, was put to death. But the most considerable part of the army of Lepidus penetrated, under the conduct of Perperna, into Spain, and joined Sertorius, who was now become the refuge of one party in its diflrefs, as Sylla had formerly been of the other. In this province ac- cordingly, while peace began to be restored in Italy, a source of new troubles was opening for the State. The prevailing party in the city was willing to grant an indemnity, and to susser all prosecution, on account of the late offences, to drop; the extreme to which Sylla had carried the severity of his executions, disposing the minds of men to the opposite course of indulgence and mercy.
Before the arrival of Lepidus with his army in Italy, Mithridates had sent to obtain from the Se- nate a ratification of the treaty he had concluded with Sylla: but, upon a complaint from Ariobar- zanes, that the king of Pontus had not himself performed his part of that treaty by the complete restitution of Cappadocia, he was directed to give full satisfaction on this point before his negotia-
tion
tion at Rome could proceed. He accordingly HAP. complied; but by the time his ambassador had xv. brought the report, the Romans were so much oc- cupied by the war they had to maintain againit Lepidus and his adherents, that they had no lei- sure for concerns so remote. This intelligence en- couraged Mithridates to think of renewing the war. Sensible that he could not rely on a perma- nent peace with the Romans, he had already pro- vided an army, not so conliderable il refped to numbers as that which he had formerly employed against them, but more formidable by the order and discipline he had endeavoured to introduce on the model of their own legion. He flattered him- self, that the diftradion under which the republic now laboured at home, would render it unable to resist his forces in Asia, and give him an oppoatu.- nity to remove the only obstruCtion that remained to his own conquests. He avoided, however, du- ring the dependence of a negotiation, and without the pretext of a new provocation, to break out into open hostilities; but he encouraged his son- in-law Tigranes, king of Armenia, to make war on the Roman allies in his neighbourhood, and thereby laid the foundation of a quarrel which he might either adopt or decline at pleasure. This prince accordingly, being then building a city, under the name of Tigranocerta, for which he wanted inhabitants, made an incursion into the kingdom of Cappadocia, and is said to have cars
ried
c H A P. ried off from thence three hundred thousand of
XV' the people to replenish his new settlement.
Soon after this nfradion of the peace, Mithri- dates, in order to have the co-operation of some of the parties into which the Roman State was di- vided, entered into a treaty with Sertorius, and wished, in concert with this adventurer, to execute the project of a march, by the route which was afterwards frequented by the barbarous nations in their successful attempts to invade and dismember the Empire of Rome. From the ihores of the Euxine it appeared easy to pass over land to the Adriatic, and once more to repeat the operations of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, by making war on the Romans in their own country.
Sertorius, who had ereted the standard of the republic in Spain, gave refuge to the Roman ex- iles from every quarter, and was now at the head of a formidable power, composed of Italians as well as natives of that country. By his birth and abilities he had pretensions to the highest prefer- ments of the State, and had been early distinguish- ed as a soldier, qualified either to plan or to exe- cute. He was attached to Marius in the time of the Cimbric war, and became a party with this leader in his quarrel with Sylla. His animosity to the latter was increased by the mutual oppofi- tion of their interests in the pursuit of civil pre- ferments. At the beginning of the civil war, Ser- torius took an active part, but shewed more re- fpet to the constitution of his country, and more
mercy
mercy to those who were opposed to him, than H A P.
xv. either of his associates Marius or Cinna. When xv , his fation was in possession of the government, he was appointed to command in Spain, and, after the ruin of its affairs in Italy, withdrew into that Province. He was received as a Roman gover- nor; but, soon after, when his enemies had pre- vailed in Italy, was attacked on their part by Caius Annius, who came with a proper force to dislodge him. He had etablifhed posts on the Pyrenees for the security of his province; but the officer to whom they were entrusted being assassinated, and the stations deserted, the enemy had free ac- cess on that fide. Not in condition to maintain himself any longer in Spain, he embarked with what forces he could assemble at Carthagena, and continued for some years, with a small squadron of Cilician galleys, to subsist by the spoils of Africa and the contiguous coasts. In this fRate of his for- tunes, Sertorius formed a project to visit the For- tunate Islands, and if a settlement could be effect- ed there, to bid farewel for ever to the Roman world, with all its factions, its divisions, and its troubles. But while he was about to set fail in search of this famous retreat in the ocean, he re- ceived an invitation from the unfubdued natives of Lusitania to become their leader. At their head his abilities soon made him conspicuous. He affected to confider his new partizans as the Se- nate and People of Rome, treating the cfeablifh- ment of Sylla in Italy as a mere usurpation. He
himfeltf
c HAP. himself took the ensigns of a Roman officer of
v . State, selected three hundred of his followers, to
whom he gave the title of Senate, and, in all his tranfadions with foreign nations assumed the name and style of the Roman Republic. In treating with Mithridates, he refused to cede the province of Asia, or to purchase the alliance of that prince by any concessions injurious to the Roman Em- pire, of which he affected to confider himself and his Senate as the legal head.
While Sertorius was acting this farce, the report of his formidable power, the late acceflion he had gained by the jundion of some of the Marian for- ces under the command of Perperna, and his sup- posed preparations to make a descent upon Italy, gave an alarm at Rome. Metellus had been some time employed against him in Spain; but being scarcely able to keep the field, the opposition he gave tended only to augment the reputation of u. C. 67u. his enemy. The Consuls lately elected were judg- D. Junius Bintus,. ed unequal to this war, and the thoughts of all Mam. Emi- lianus livi- men were turned on Pompey, who, though yet in anus.
no public character, nor arrived at the legal age of State preferments, had the address on this, as on many other occasions, to make himself be pointed at as the only person who could effectually serve the republic. He was accordingly, with the title of Proconsul, joined to Metellus in the conduc of the war in Spain I. It no doubt facilitated the

career of this young man's pretenlions, that few c A. p. men of diflinguifhed abilities were now in the iay to iiftnin the fortunes of the republic. Such perlons, of whatever party, had, in their turns; been the firit vicims of the late violent naffa- cres; and the party of Sylla, w hich was now the tepublic, when confidered as a nursery of eminent men, had lonie diiadvantage, perhaps in the fu- periority of its leader, who was himself equal to all its affairs, and tatught others to confide and obey; iather than to nd for themselves. Pompey was not of an age to have fuiTered from this influence. He came into the party in its bulief tinme, and had been entrutled with separate commands. He had already obtained for himself a cohfiderable mea- sure of that artificial consideration which, though it cannot be ftipported without abilities, often ex- ceeds the degree of merit on which it is founded; and this consideration to the end of his life he continued to augment with muchl attention and many concerted intrigues. His genius, however, for war was real, and was now about to be exer- cifed and improved in the contetl wvith Sertorius, an excellent mailer, whose lesions were rough but inftrudive.
Pompey having made the levies destined for this service, took his' departure from Italy by a new toute, and was the firIf Roman gencral iwho made his way into Spain by the Alps through Gaul aind the Pyrcnnees'. Soon after his arrival, a legion that

c H A p. covered the foragers of his army was intercepted
ox_. and cut off by the enemy. Sertorius was engaged
in the iiege of Laura. Pompey advanced to re- lieve it. Sertorius, upon his approach, took post on an eminence. Pompey prepared to attack him, and the besieged had hopes of immediate relief. But Sertorius had made his disposition in such a manner, that Pompey cohld not advance without exposing his own rear to a party that was placed to attack him. " I will teach this pupil of Sylla," he said, " to look behind as well as before him ;" and Pompey, feeing his danger, chose to withdraw, leaving the town of Laura to fall into the enemy's hands, while he himself continued a fpe&ator of the iiege, and of the deftrudion of the place. As- ter this unsuccessful beginning of the war, he was obliged to retire into Gaul for the winter r. u. c. 677. The following year, Cn. Odavius and C. Scri- vius c. bonius Curio being Consuls, Pompey till retained S"ribonis his command; and, having repassed the Pyrennees,
directed his march to join Metellus. Sertorius lay on the Sucroz, and wished to engage one or other of these parties before their junCion; and Pompey, on his part, being desirous to reap the glory of a separate vidory, an adion ensued, in which the wing on which Pompey fought was defeated by Sertorius; but the other wing had the victory over Perperna. As Sertorious was about to renew the action on the following day,

he was preventec by the arrival of Metellus. " If c A P.
xV. " the old woman had not interposed," he said, - " I flould have whipt the boy, and sent him back
to his schools at Rome." This war continued about two years longer with various success, but without any memiorable event, until it ended by the death of Sertorius, who, at the instigation of his aifociate Perperna, was betrayed and assassinated by a few of his own attendants. Perperna, having removed Sertorius by this base aftion, put himself at the head of both their adherents, and endeavoured to keep them united, at least until he hould be able to purchase his peace at Rome. He was, however, deserted by numbers of those who had been attached to Sertori- us, and at last surprised by Pompey, and slain. He had made offers to disclose the secrets of the party, and to produce the correspondence which many of the principal citizens at Rome held with Sertorius, inviting him to return into Italy, and promising to join him with a considerable force. The let- ters which had passed in this correspondence were secured by Pompey, and, without being opened, were burned. So masterly an ac of prudence, in a person who was yet confidered as a young man, has been deservedly admired. It served to ex- tinguifh remains of the Marian faction, and recon- ciled men, otherwise difaffeded, to a situation in which they were now assured of impunity and even of concealment.
P 2 While
c H A P. While Pompey was thus gathering laurels in.
xv. ' the field, C. Julius Cafar, being about seven years
younger, that is, twenty-three years of age, was returned from Asia.; and, to make some trial of his parts, lodged a complaint against Dolabella, late Proconsul of Macedonia, for oppression and extor- tion in his province. Cotta and Hortenfius, ap- pearing for the defendant, procured his acquittal Cicero fays, that he himself was then returned from a journey he had made into Asia, and was present at this trial. The following year Caesar left. Rome, with intention to pass some time under a celebrated master of rhetoric at Rhodes. In his way he was taken by pirates, and remained their prisoner about forty days, until he found means to procure from Metellus a. fum of fifty talents ', which was paid for his ransom. He had frequent- ly warned the pirates, while yet. in their hands, that he should punish their insolence; and at part- ing, he told them to expect the performance of his promise. Upon being set on shore, he aflem- bled and armed some vessels on the coast, pursued his late captors, took and brought them into port. From thence he hastened to Junius Silanus, the Proconsul of Bythinia, and applied for an order to have them executed; but being refused by this officer, he made his way back with still greater dif- patch, and, before any inftrudions could arrive to the contrary, had his prisoners nailed to the cross. Such lawless banditti had long infested the seas of
Asia- ' Near to L. Ic,c::.
Asia and of Greece, and furnished at times no in- c H A P. considerable employment to the arms of the re- _ public. Servilius Vatia, who afterwards bore the title of Ifauricus, had lately been employed against them; and, after clearing the seas, endeavoured likewise to destroy or to secure their sea-ports and firong-holds on ihore. They, nevertheless, reco- vered from this blow they had received from Ifau- ricus, and continued to appear at intervals in new swarms, to the great interruption of commerce and of all the communications by sea, in the em- pire.
Under the reformations of Sylla, which, by dif- arming the tribunitian power, in a great me: sure shut up the source of former disorders, the repu- rlic was now restored to some degree of tranquil- lity, and resumed its attention to the ordinary as- fairs of peace. The bridge on the Tiber, which had been erected of wood, was taken down and rebuilt with stone; bearing the name of iEmilius, one of the Quaefors under whose inspection the fabric had been reared; and as a public concern of fiill greater importance, it is mentioned, that a treatise on agriculture, the producion of Mago a Carthaginian, and in the language of Carthage, was, by the express orders of the Senate, now tranf- lated into Latin. At the reduction of Carthage, the Romans were yet governed by huibandmen, and, amidst the literary spoils of that city, this book alone, consisting of twenty-eight rolls or vo- lumes, was supposed to merit so much of the pu-
P 3 blic
C H A. blic attention, as to be secured for the State. A
' x. number of persons, ikilled in the Punic language,
together with Silanus, who had principal charge of the business, were now employed in translating it '.
The calm, however, which the republic enjoy- ed under this period of regular government and pacific pursuits, was not altogether undiifurbed. In the Consulate of Cn, Odavius and C. Scribo- nius Curio, the Tribune Licinius made an attempt to recover the former powers of the office. He ventured, in pretence of both the Consuls, to ha- rangue the People, and exhorted them to reaffume their ancient rights. As a circumstance which serves to mark the petulant boldness of these men, it is mentioned that the Consul Odavius, on this occasion, being ill, was muffled up, and covered with a dressing which brought flies in great num- bers about him. The Consuls being placed toge- ther, Curio made a vehement speech, at the close of which, the Tribune called out to Odavius, ( You never can repay your colleague's service of " this day; if he had not been near you, while he " spoke, and beat the air so much with his gefti- " culations, the flies must by this time have eaten " you up ." The sequel is imperfedly known; but the dispute appears to have been carried to a great height, and to have ended in a tumult, in which the Tribune Licinius was killed.
Upon a review of Sylla's ads intended to re- store the authority of the Senate, it may be quef-
tioned, I Plin. lib. xviii. c. Z Cicero de Claris Cratoribu:.
tioned, whether that clause in the law relating to c H A P. the Tribunes, by which all persons having accept- , ed of this office were excluded from any furtherpre- ferment in the State; may not have had an ill effet, and required correction. It rendered the Tribu- nate an object only to the meanest of the Senators, who, upon their acceptance of it, ceasing to have any pretensions to the higher offices of State, were, .by this means, deprived of any interest in the go- vernment, and exasperated of course against the higher dignities of the commonwealth from which they were themselves excluded. Aurelius Cotta, u.c. 678.
L Oda- one of the Consuls that succeeded Cn. Octavius and ,,us, c. Au- Curio, moved perhaps by this consideration, propo-reliusCotta- fed to have that clause repealed, and was warmly supported by the Tribune Opimius, who, contrary to the prohibition lately enacted, ventured to ha- rangue the People; and for this offence, at the expiration of his office, was tried and condemn- ed I.
By the defects which the People began to appre- hend in their present institutions, or by the part which their demagogues began to take against the aristocracy, the Roman State, after a very short re- spite, began to relapse into its former troubles, and was again to exhibit the curious spectacle of a nation divided against itself, broken and diffrated in its councils at home, but viCtorious in all its operations abroad, and gaining continual accessions of empire, under the effect of convulsions which
P 4 shook .'Cicero, 3tio, in Verrem., Pxdianus, ibid,
C. HAPI. 0ook the' commonwealth itself to its base; and,
,V., what is still less to be paralleled in the history of
mankind, exhibiting the fpedacle of a nation, which continued from the earlicet ages to proceed in its aftairs abroad with a ficccfs that may be imputed in a great measure to its divisions at home.
War, in the detail of its operations, if not even in the formation of its plans, is more likely to fuc- ceed under single men than under numerous councils. The Roman constitution, though far from an arrangement proper to preserve domestic peace and tranquillity, was an excellent nursery of Ilatefmien and warriors. To individuals trained in this school, all foreign affairs were committed with little responsibility and less controul. The ruling passion, even of the least virtuous citizens, during some ages, was the ambition of being con- fiderable, and of riling to the highest dignities of the State at home. In the provinces they enjoy- ed the condition of monarchs; but they valued this condition only as it furnished them with the occalion of triumphs, and contributed to their im- portance at Rome. They were factious and tur- bulent in their competition for preferment and honours in the capital; but, in order the better to support that very contest at home, were faithful and inflexible in maintaining all the pretenlions of the State abroad. Thus Sylla, though deprived of his command by an ad of the opposite fation at Rome, and with many of his fiiends, who escape'd from the bloody hands of their perfecu-
tors,
tors, condemned and outlawed, still maintained c HA P.
xV. the part of a Roman officer of state, and pre- fcribed to Mithridates, in the terms which might have been expected from a Roman Magistrate in the molt undiftu'bed exercise of his trust. Ser- torius, in the fame manner, acting for the op- pofite faction, in some measure preserved a similar dignity of character, and on the proposals which were made to him by the fame Prince, refused to make concessions unworthy of the Roman republic. Contrary to the fate of other nations, where the State is weak, while the conduct of individuals is regular; here the State was in vigour, while the conduct of individuals was in the highest degree irregular and wild.
The reputation of the Romans, even in the in- tervals of war, procured them accessions of terri- tory without labour, and without expence. Thus, kingdoms were bequeathed to them by will; as that of Pergamus formerly by the testament of Attalus; that of Cyrene, at the bequest of Ptolomy Appion; and that of Bithynia, about this time, by the will of Nicomedes. To the fame effedc, princes and states, where they did not make any formal cession of their sovereignty, did somewhat equivalent, by submitting their rights co discussion at Rome, and by soliciting from the Romans, grants of which the world now seemed to acknowledge the vali- dity, by having recourse to them as the bais of tenures by which they were to hold their poflef- pns. To the fame effect alto, the sons of the last
Antiochus,
c H A P. Antiochus, king of Syria, having pafled two years
,at Rome, waiting decisions of the Senate, and so- liciting a grant of the kingdom of Egypt, on which they formed their opposite pretensions, thus stated themselves as fubjeas or dependents on the republic of Rome.
In Asia, by these means, the Roman empire ad- vanced on the ruin of those who had formerly op- posed its progress. The Macedonian line, in the monarchy of Syria, was now broken off, or extint. The monarchy itself was no more. For on the defeat of Antiochus at Sipylus, followed by the defection of provincial governors and tributary princes, who, no longer awed by the power of their former mafler, entered into a correspondence with the Romans, and were by them acknowledg- ed as sovereigns, the empire of Syria, once so en- tire, was split and dismembered. In this manner also the Itates of Armenia, long subjed to the Per- sians, and afterwards to the Macedonians, now be- came the feat of a new monarchy under Tigranes. And, to complete these revolutions of empire, the natives of the last diftridt to which the name of Syria was affixed, weary of the degeneracy and weakness of their own court, of the irregularity of the succession to the throne of their own kingdom; weary of the frequent competitions which involv- ed them in blood, invited Tigranes the king of Armenia to wield a sceptre which the descendants of Seleucus were no longer in condition to hold. This prince, accordingly, extended his kingdom to
both
both fides of the Euphrates, and held the remains H A P. of Assyria itself as one of its divisions . ,x
In these circumstances, the Romans were left undisturbed to re-eftablifl their province in the Lesser Asia: and under the auspices of Servilius, who, from his principal acquisition in those parts, had the name of Ifauricus, were extending their limits on the fide of Cilicia, and were hastening to the sovereignty of that coast, when their pro- grefs was suddenly checked by the re-appearance of an enemy, who had already given them much trouble in the eastern part of the empire.
Mithridates, king of Pontus, who appears to have revived in his own breast the animofities of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal against the Romans, had never ceased, since the date of his last mortifying treaty with Sylla, to devise the means of renewing the war. Having attempted in vain to engage Sylla in a league with himself against the Romans, he made a similar attempt on Sertorius, to which we have already referred. Affeding to confider this fugitive, with his little Senate, as head of the republic, he pressed for a cession of the Roman province in Alia in his own favour, and in return offered to aflift the followers of Sertorius with all his forces in the recovery of Italy. In this ne- gotiation, however, he found, as has been already remarked, that whoever assumed the character of a Roman officer of slate, supported it with a like inflexible dignity. Sertorius refused to difiember the empire, but accepted of the proffered aid from

XV' ficers of the Roman eflablifhment to assist in the
formation and discipline of his troops.
The king of Pontus, now bent on correcting the error which is common in extensive and barbarous monarchies, of relying entirely on numbers, with less attention to discipline or military skill, proposed to form a more regular army than that which he had assembled in the former war; and, however little successful in his attempts, he endeavoured to rival his enemy in every particular of their discipline, in the choice and use of their weapons, and in the form of their legion. With troops beginning to make these reformations, and amounting to one hundred and twenty thousand foot, and sixteen thousand horse, he made an open declaration of war, and, without resistance, took possession of Cap- padocia and Phrygia, beyond the bounds which the Romans had prescribed to his kingdom. As he was to ad both by sea and by land, he began with customary oblations to Neptune and to Mars. To the first he made an offering of a splendid car- riage, drawn by white horses, which he precipi- tated from a cliff, and funk in the sea; to .the o- ther he made a sacrifice, which, as described by the historian1, filled the imagination more than any of the rites usually practised by ancient na- tions. The king, with his army, ascended the highest mountain on their route, formed on its summit a great pile of wood, of which he himself
laid 1 Appian
laid the first materials, and ordered the fabric to c r A P. be raised in a pyramidical form to a great height. ',. The top was loaded with offerings of honey, milk, oil, wine, and perfumes. As soon as it was finifll- ed, the army around it began the solemnity with a feast, at the end of which the pile was set on fire, and in proportion as the heat increased, the hofR extended its circle, and came down from the mountain. The smoke and the flames continued to ascend for many days, and were seen, it is said, at the distance of a thousand fladia, or above an' hundred miles '.
After this solemnity was over, Mithridates en- deavoured to animate and to unite in a common zeal for his cause the different nations which, in forming his army, had been collected from the most distant parts of the empire. For this pur- pose he enumerated the successes by which he him- self had raised his kingdom. to its present pitch of greatness, and represented the numerous vices or defeds of the enemy with whom he was now to contend, reciting their divisions at home, their op- pression abroad, their avarice, and their infatiablc luff of dominion.
The Romans were some time undetermined in the choice of a person to be employed against this formidable enemy. Pompey, being still in Spain, saw with regret a service of this importance likely to fall to the ihare of another; and he had his partizans at Rome who would have ladly piut off

He had about this time, impatient of his absence from Rome, wrote a letter to the Senate, complaining, in petulant terms, of their neglec, and of the traits to which the troops un- der his command were reduced for want of pay and provisions, and threatening, if not speedily supplied, to fall back upon Italy. The Consul Lucullus, apprehending what might be the confe- quence of Pompey's arrival, with a military force, and wishing not to furnifl him with any pre- tence for leaving his province, had the army in Spain completely supplied, and, at the fame time, took proper measures to support his own preten- lions to the command in Asia. From his rank as Consul in office, he had a natural claim to this fta- tion; and from his knowledge of the country, and of the war ' with this very enemy, in which he had already borne some part under Sylla , he was
well x Vide Ciceronis in Lucullo, c. r et 2. 2 Plutarch. in Lucull. initio. Edit. Lond. 4to, vol. iii. p. 137 Cicero is often quoted to prove, that Lucullus, at this time, was a mere novice in war, and owed the knowledge by which he came to be diftinguilh- ed, to Speculation and study, not to experience. It is observed by Lord Bo- lingbroke, that Cicero, who, among his other pretensions to fame, aspired to that of a military commander, had an interest in having it believed, that great officers might be formed in this manner: But as he could not be ignorant that Luctlllus had acled under Sylla, it is probable, that he affeded to confidcr the part which was assigned to him by Sylla, as a mere civil employment. He is indeed mentioned as having charge of the coinage with which Sylla paid his army, and of the fleet with which he transported them into Asia : but it is not to be supposed, that there were the only operations confided by Sylla to a lieutenant of so much ability.

When the provinces came to be difiributed, the difficulties which presented themselves in Alia were thought to require the presence of both the Con- fuls. The kingdom of Bythinia, which had been lately bequeathed to the Romans, was in danger of being invaded before they could obtain a for- mal poifeffion of this inheritance; at the fame time that the enemy, by whom they were threat- ened, was not likely to limit his operations to the attack of that country. Of the Consuls, Cotta was appointed to seize on the kingdom of Bythi- nia, and Lucullus to lead the army againit Mithri- dates wherever else he should carry the war. Cot- ta set out immediately for his province. Lucullus, being detained in making the necessary levies, fol- lowed some time afterwards; but before his arri- val in Asia, Cotta had been obliged to evacuate Bythinia, and to take refuge in Chalcedonia. The king of Pontus, being superior both by sea and by land, had over-run the country in the neighbour- hood of this place; and, having broke the chain which shut up the mouth of the harbour, entered and burnt some Roman gallies, which were flation- ed there. Not thinking it advisable to attack the town of Chalcedonia, he turned his forces againil Cyzicus, a port on the Propontis, and blocked up the place both by ifa and by land; being well- provided with battering engines, and the other ne- ccfarics of a siege, he had lhocp of being soon
aible
CHAP. able to reduce it by ftorn. The inhabitants, nec sj , verthelefs, were prepared to refit, and were in ex-
pectation of being speedily relieved by the Romans.
Such was the state of affairs when Lucullus ar- rived in Asia; and having joined his new levies to the legions which had served under Fimbria, and to the other troops already in the province, he as- fembled an army of about thirty thousand men, with which he advanced to re-establish Cotta in his province, and to relieve the town of Cyzicus.
Mithridates being elated by his own fiucceffes, and by the fuperioritv of his numbers, did not sus- ficiently attend to the motions of Lucullus, suffered him to get possession of the heights in his rear, and to cut off his principal supplies of provisions and forage. Trusting, however, that his magazines would not be exhausted before he should have for- ced the town of Cyzicus to surrender, he continued the siege. But his engines not being well served, and the defence being obflinate, his army began to be distressed for want of provisions, and it became neceifary to lessen his consumption. For this pur- pose he secretly detached some part of his cavalry, which being intercepted by the Romans on their march, were cut off or dispersed; and the king, now feeing the remainder of his troops unable to' subsist any longer in their present situation, em- barked on board one of his gallies, ordered the army to force their way to Lampfacus, while lie himself endeavoured to escape with his fleet. In this retreat, being harraffed by Lucullus, the great-
er
er part of the late befigers of Cyzicus perified in C I A p. passing the Afopus and the GrannicLis. The king X himself, having put into Nicomedia, and fioin ,thence continuing his voyage thrqugh the Boipho- rus to the Eixine, was overtaken on that tea by a .storm, and loft the greatest part of his filipping. His own galley being funk, he himlcif narro,,-y escaped in a barge.
The whole force with which the king of Pon- tus had invaded Bythinia, being thus dispelled like a cloud, Lucullus employed some time in reducig .the towns into which any of the troops of Mi- thridates had been received; and having effectual- ly destroyed the remains of the vanquiihed army, took his route by Bythinia and Galatia towards Pontus. At the entrance into this kingdom was situate the town of Amyfus, a considerable fortress on the coast of the Euxine, into which had been thrown a sufficient force to retard the progress of an enemy. Mithridates, under favour of the de- lays;obtained by the defence of this place, as- enibled a new army at Cabira, near the frontier of Armenia. Here he mustered about forty thousand foot, and a considerable body of horse, and was soliciting the Scythians, Armenians, and all the nations of that continent to his aid.
Lucullus, in order to prevent, if possible, any further reinforcemcnts to the enemy, committed the flege of Amyfu, to M:.rena, and advanced with his army into the plains of Cabira. On this ground the Roman horse received repeated checks from those of the enemy, and we:e kept in continual
VOL, II. Q alarm
c H A P. alarm until their general, having time to observe
xv the country, avoided the plains on which the king
of Pontus, by means of his cavalry, was greatly superior. In pursuit of this plan, though very much straitened for provisions, Lucullus kept his polition on the heights, until the enemy could be attacked with advantage. the ikirmifhes which happened between the foraging parties, brought into acion considerable numbers from the refpec- tive armies; and the troops of Mithridates, having been routed in one of there partial encounters, the king took a resolution to decamp in the night, and remove to a gre~;ter distance from his enemy. As soon as it was dark, the equipage and the attend- ants of the leading men in the camp, to whom he had communicated this resolution, began to with- draw; and the army, greatly alarmed with that appearance, was seized with a panic, and could not be restrained from flight. Horse and foot, and bodies of every description crowded in dif- order into the outlets from the camp, and were trod under foot, or in great numbers perished by each other's hands. Mithridates himself, endea- vouring to flop and to undeceive them, was car- ried off as by the torrent, which could not be withifood.
The noise of this tumult being heard to a great distance, and the occasion being known in the Roman camp, Lucullus advanced with his army to profit by the confusion into which the ene- my were fallen, and by a vigorous attack, ha-
ving
ving put many to the sword, hastened their total c I A P. rout and difperfion.xv
The king himself was, by one of his servants, with difficulty mounted on horseback, and must have been taken, if the pursuing party had not been amused in seizing some plunder, which he had ordered on purpose to be left in their way. A mule, loaded with some part of the royal trea- sure, turned the attention of his pursuers, while he himself made his escape.
In his flight the king appeared to be most as- feded with the fate of his women. The greatest number of them were left at the palace of Phar- nacea, a place that must soon fall into the hands of the enemy. He therefore dispatched a faithful eunuch with orders to put them to death, leaving the choice of the manner to themselves. A few are particularly mentioned. Of two, who were his own fiters, Roxana and Statira, one died ut- tering execrations against her brother's cruelty, the other extolling, in that extremity of his own fortune, the generous care he took of their honour. Monime, a Greek of Miletus, celebrated for her beauty, whom the king had long wooed in vain with proffers of great riches, and whom he won at last only by the participation of his crown, and the earnest of the nuptial rites, had ever lamented her fortune, which, instead of a royal husband and a palace, had given her a prison, and a barbarous keeper. Being now told, that fle must die, but: that the manner of her death was left to her own

XV. _ and, using it as a bandage, endeavoured to firangle
herself. It broke in the attempt: *' Bauble," fhc said, " it is not fit even for this !" then firetching out her neck to the eunuch, bid him fulfil his ma- iler's purpose. Berenice of Chios, another Grae- cian beauty, had likewise been honoured with the nuptial crown, and, having been attended in her state of melancholy elevation by her mother, who, on this occasion, likewise resolved to partake of her daughter's fate; they chose to die by poison. The mother intreated that she might have the first draught; and died before her daughter. The re- mainder of the dose not being sufficient for the queen, she put herself likewise into the hands of the executioner, and was fWrangled. By these deaths, the barbarous jealousy of the king was gratified, and the future triumph of the Roman general de- prived of its principal ornaments.
Lucullus, after his victory, having no enemy in the field to oppose him, overran the country, and passed without interruption through most of the towns in the kingdom of Pontus. He found many palaces enriched with treasure, and adorned with barbarous magnificence; and, as might be ex- peded under such a violent and difiruilful govern- inent, every where places of confinement crowded with prisoners of trate, whom the jealousy of the king had secured, and whom his supercilious ne- glect had suffered to remain in custody, even as- ter his jcalo.fy wras allayed.

Mithridates, from his late defeat, fled into Ar- c H A P. menia, and claimed the protection of Tigranes, xv who, being married to his daughter, had already favoured him in his designs against the Romans.
This powerful prince, now become sovereign of Syria as well as Armenia, still continued his re- fidence in the last of these kingdoms at Tigrano- certa, a city he himself had built, flocked with in- habitants, and distinguished by his own name. On the arrival of Mithridates to sue for his protection, Tigranes declined to fee him, but ordered him a princely reception in one of the palaces.
Lucullus continued his pursuit of this flying ene- my only to the frontier of Armenia, and from thence, fending Publius Clodius, who was his bro- ther-in-law, to the court of Tigranes, with in- firudions to require that Mithridates ihould be delivered up as a lawful prey, he himself fell back into the kingdom of Pontus, and soon after redu- ced Amyfus, together with Sinopi, and other pla- ces of strength, which were held by the troops of the king.
The inhabitants of these places had been origi- nally colonies from Greece, and having been sub- dued by the Persians, were, on the arrival of Alex- ander the Great, from refpeta to their origin, re- fiored to their freedom. In imitation of this ex- ample, and agreeably to the profession which the Romans ever made of protedting the liberties of Greece, Lucullus once more declared those cities to be free.

cient leisure to attend to the general itate of the Ro- man affairs that were committed to his government, found the following particulars from which we may collec the measure of abuse to which the conquered provinces were exposed. The collectors of reve- nue, under pretext of levying the tax imposed by Sylla, had been guilty of the greatest oppreflions. The inhabitants, in order to pay this tax, borrow- ed money of the Roman officers and merchants at exorbitant interest ; and, when they no longer had any credit, their effects were distrained for pay- ment, or themselves threatened with imprisonment and tortures: private persons were reduced to the necessity of exposing their children to sale, and cor- porations of felling the pictures, images, and other ornaments of their temples, in order to satisfy these inhuman creditors. Willing to restrain, or to cor- rect these abuses, Lucullus ordained, that where the fumn exacted for usury was equal to the capi- tal, the.debt should be cancelled; and in other ca- fes, fixed the interest at a moderate rate. These adts of beneficence or justice to the provinces were, by the farmers of the revenue, represented as ats of oppression and cruelty to themselves, and were, among their connections, and the fiharers of their profits at Rome, stated against Lucullus-as fubjeds of complaint and reproach.

Q 4 ' thy
C H P. thy in great numbers for the entertainment of the
I._ public, and even for private amusement. The
handsomest, the most active, and the boldest of the slaves or captives were feleded for this purpose. They were sworn to decline no combat, and to {tlun no hardlhip, to which they were exposed by their mailers; they were of different denomina- tions, and accustomed to fight in different ways; but those from whom the whole received their de- fignation, employed the fxvord and buckler, or target; and they commonly fought naked, that the place and nature of the wounds they received might the more plainly appear.
Even in this proflituttion of valour, refinements of honour were introduced. There were certain gra- ces of attitude which the gladiator was not per- mitted to quit, even to avoid a wound. There was a manner wvhich 'he studied to preserve in his fall, in his bleeding posture, and even in his death. He was applauded, or hissed, according as he fuc- ceeded or failed in any of these particulars. When, after a tedious struggle, lhe was spent with labour and with the loss of blood, he still endeavoured to preserve the dignity of his character, dropt or re- fumed the sword at his master's pleasure, and look.- ed round to the fpedators- for marks of their satis- faction and applause '.
Perobns of every age, condition, and sex, attend- ed at these exhibitions; and when the pair who were engaged began to Itrain and to bleed, the

fpe&ators, being divided in their inclinations, en- c H A P. deavoured to excite, by their cries and acclama- .',.. tions, the party they favoured; and when the con- test was ended, called to the victor to .strike, or to spare, according as the vanquished was supposed to have forfeited or to have deserved his life . With fpedacles of this fort, which must create so much disgust and horror in the recital, the Ro- mans were more intoxicated than any populace in modern Europe now are with the baiting of bulls, or the running of horses, probably because they were more deeply affeded, and more intensely moved by the scene.
Spartacus, a Thracian captive, who, on account of his strength and activity, had been destined for this barbarous profeifion, with about seventy or eighty of his companions, having escaped from their place of confinement, armed themselves with such weapons as accident presented to them, and reti- ring to some fastness on the ascents of Vesuvius, from thence harafled the country with robberies and murders. " If we are to fight," laid the leader of this desperate band, " let us fight against our "oppressors, and in behalf of our own liberties,
not to make sport for this petulant and cruel "race of men." Multitudes of flares from every quarter flocked to his standard. The Prefec of Capua turned out the inhabitants of his diftric? against them, but was defeated.

CH AP. the insurrection, furnished the rebels with arms,
x.x . and raised their reputation and their courage.
Their leader, by his generosity in rejecting his own share of any booty he made by his conduct and his valour, acquired the authority of a legal commander; and, having named Crixus and Oe- nomaus, two other gladiators, for his Subordinate officers, he formed the multitudes that retorted to him into regular bodies, employed a certain num- ber to fabricate arms. and to procure the neceflary accommodations of a camp, till at length he col- leted an army of seventy thousand men, with which he commanded the country to a great ex- tent. He had already fucceflively defeated the Praetors Clodius, Varinus, and Coffinius, who had been sent againit him with considerable forces, so that it became neceifary to order proper levies, and to give to the Consuls the charge of repressing this formidable enemy.
Spartacus had too much prudence to think him- self fit to contend with the force of the Roman State, which he perceived must soon be assembled against him. He contented himself, therefore, with a more rational scheme of conducting his ar- my by the ridge of the Appenines, till he fholdd gain the Alps, from whence his followers, whether Gauls, Germans, or Thracians, might separate, each into the country of which he was a native, or from which he had been brought into the state of bondage, from which they now endeavoured to extricate themselves.
While
While he began his progress by the mountains, c 1 A P.
XVI. in order to execute this project, the Consuls, Gel-. ' v lius and Lentulus, had already taken the field a- U. C. 6,8"

But Lentulus afterwards pressing hard upon Spartacus, who led the main body of the rebels, brought on an adtion, in which the confu- lar army was defeated with considerable loss. Caf- fius too, the Praetor of Cisalpine Gaul, having ad- vanced upon him with an army of ten thousand men, was repulsed with great fliughter.
In consequence of these advantages, Spartacus might no doubt have effeced his retreat to the Alps; but his army being elated with vitory, * and confidering themselves as masters of Italy,
were unwilling to abandon their conquest. He himself formed a new projeEt of marching to Rome; and for this purpose destroyed all his fu- perfluous baggage and cattle, put his captives to death, and refused to receive any more of the ·slaves, who were still in multitudes resorting to his itandard. He probably expedted to elude or to pass the Roman armies without a battle, and to force the city of Rome itself by an unexpeced as- fault. In this he was disappointed by the Con- fuls, with whom he was obliged to fight in the Picenum ; and, though victorious in the adcion, he loft hopes of surprising the city. But still thinking himself in condition to keep his ground
in
C IHAP. in Italy, he only altered his route, and direced xV'. his march towards Lucania.
The Romans, greatly embarrassed, and thrown into some degree of consternation, by the unex- peaed continuance of an infurredion which had given them much trouble, and which exposed their armies to much danger, with little profped of honour; not being courted, as usual, for the command in this service, they imposed rather than conferred it on Marcus Crassus, then in the rank of Praetor, and conlidered as a person of consequence, more on account of his wealth than of his abili- ties; though in this service, after others had fail- ed, he laid the foundation of a more favourable judgment. They at the fame time sent orders to Pompey, who had finished the war in Spain, to halten into Italy with his army; and to the Pro- consul of Macedonia, to embark with what forces could be spared from his province.
Crassus assembled no less than fix legions, with which he joined the army which had been already so unsuccessful against the revolt. Of the troops who had miscarried, he is said to have executed, perhaps only decimated, four thousand, as an ex- ample to the new levies, and as a warning of the severities they were to exped for any failure in the remaining part of the service.
Upon his arrival in Lucania he cut off ten thou- sand of the rebels, who were flationed at a dif- tance from the main body of their army, and he endeavoured to shut up Spartacus in the penzinfiia
' .
of Brutium, or head of land which extends to the c H A P. Straits of Messina. The gladiators desired to pass XV1 into Sicily, where their fellow-fufferers, the slaves of that island, were not yet entirely subdued, and where great numbers at all times were prepared to revolt: but they were prevented by the want of shipping. Crassus at the fame time undertook a work of great labour, that of intrenching the land from sea to sea with a ditch fifteen feet wide, and as many deep, extending, according to Plu- tarch, three hundred stadia, or above thirty miles. Spartacus endeavouring to interrupt the execu- tion of this work, was frequently repulsed; and his followers beginning to despond, entertained thoughts of surrender. But in order to supply by despair what they loft in courage, he put them in mind that they fought not upon equal terms with their enemies; that they must either conquer or be treated as fugitive slaves; and, to enforce his admonitions, he ordered one of his captives to be nailed to the cross in light of both armies. " This," he said to his own people, " is "an example of what you are to susser if you
fall into the enemy's hands." Whilst Crassus was busy completing his line of countervallation, Spartacus prepared to force it; and, having provided faggots and other materials for this purpose, filled up theditch at a convenient place, and passed it in the night with the whole body of his followers. Diretiing his flight to
Apulia,
c HA P. Apulia, he was pursued, and greatly harassed in
Xv. X__.* his march.
Accounts being received at once in the camp of Crassus and in that of Spartacus, that fresh troops -were landed at Brundulium from Macedonia, and that Pompey was arrived in Italy, and on his march to join Crassus, both armies were equally disposed to hazard a battle; the gladiators, that they might not be attacked at once by so many ene- mies as were collecing against them; and the Ro- mans under Crassus, that Pompey might not arrive to fiatch out of their hands the glory of terminating the war. Under the influence of there different motives, both leaders drew forth their armies; and when they were ready to engage, Spartacus, with the valour rather of a gladiator than of a ge- neral, alighting from his horse, and faying aloud, in the hearing of his followers, " If I conquer to- " day, I Ihall be better mounted; if not, I shall " not have occasion for a horse," he plunged his fwrord into the body of the animal. With this carneft of a resolution to conquer or to die, he ad- vanced towards the enemy; directing the division in which he himself commanded to make their attack where he underifood the Roman general -c:s poled. He intended to decide the adtion by forcing the Romans in that quarter; but after much bloodshed, being mangled with wounds, and still almost alone in the midst of his enemies, he continued to ight til'lc: was .ill d; and the vic- tory of courft declared fJr his enemy. About a
thousand
thousand of the Romans were flail; of .the van- c HA P. quifled the greatest slaughter, as usual in ancient XVI battles, took place after the flight began. The dead were not numbered; about fix thousand were taken, and, in the manner of executing the fen- tence of death on slaves, they were nailed to the cross in rows, that almost lined the way from Ca- pua to Rome. Such as escaped from the field of battle, being about five thousand, fell into the hands of Pompey, and furnished a pretence to his flatterers for ascribing to him the honour of termi- nating the war.
The mean quality of the enemy however, in the present cafe, precluded even Crassus from the ho- nour of a triumph; he could have only an ovation or military. procession on foot. But instead of the myrtle wreath, usual on such occasions, he had credit enough with the Senate to obtain the laurel crown '.
Pompey too arrived at the fame time in the city with new and uncommon pretensions, requiring a dispensation from the law and eftabliflled forms of the commonwealth. The service he had conducted in Spain being of the nature of a civil war of Ro- man citizens against one another, or against sub- jects of the empire, with a Roman general at their head, did not give a regular claim to a triumph: The vidor himself was yet under the legal age, and had not paifed through any of the previous teps of Questor, iEdile and Praetor; yet on the
present z Ad. Gellius, lib. v.
C H A . present occasion he not only insisted on a triumph,
. but put in his claim likewise to an immediate no- mination to the office of Consul.
It now became extremely evident, that the es- tablified honours of the State, conferred in the usual way, were not adequate to the pretensions of this young man: that' he must have new and singular appointments, or those already known beltowed on him in some new and singular man- ner. His enemies observed, that he avoided every occasion of fair competition with his fellow citi- zens; that he took a rank of importance to himself, which he did not submit to have examined; and that he ever aspired to an eminence in which he might Rtand alone, or in the firfi place of public consideration and honour. His partizans, on the contrary, flated the extraordinary favours bestowed on him, as the foundation of still farther diftinc- tions'. In enumerating his services upon his re- turn from Spain, they reckoned up, according to Pliny, eight hundred and feventy-one towns, from the Pyrennees to the extremities of that country, which he had reduced; observed that he had fur- passed the glory of all the officers who had gone before him in that service; and, in consequence of there representations, though still in a private flation, he was admitted to a triumph, or partook \with Metellus in this honour.
Pompey had hitherto, in all the late disputes, raken part with the aristocracy ; but not without
suspicion id. Cicer. pio Lege MIaniliA,

XVL vernment of any fort. While he supported the. Senate, he affected a kind of diftinscion fupe- rior to those who composed it, and was not con- tent with equality, even among the first ranks of his country. He acquiesced, nevertheless, in the mere ihew of importance, and did not insist on- prerogatives which might have engaged him in contefis, and exposed his pretensions to too near an inspection. Upon his approach at the head of an army from Spain, the Senate was greatly alarm- ed; but he gave the most unfeigned assurances of his intention to disband his army as soon as they ihould have attended his triumph. The Senate accordingly gave way to this irregular pretention, and afterwards to the pretension, fill more dan- gerous, which, without any of the previous condi- tions which the law required, he made to the Con- u. c. 683. fulate. Crassus, who having been Praetor in the crat.' preceding year, now stood for the fame office, en- MrnLlP. tered into a concert with Pompey, by which not- withstanding their mutual jealousy of each other, they joined their interests, and were eleCcd to- gether.
Under the administration of there officers some important laws are said to have pafled, although most of the particulars have escaped the notice of those from whom our accounts are taken. It appears that Pompey now began to pay his court to the popular faion; and, though he professed to support the authority of the Senate, wished to have

c u A P. it in his power, on occasion, to take the sense of -~ l what was called the aflembly of the People against
them, or, in other words, to counterad them by means of the popular tumults which bore this name.
The Tribunes, Quindius and Palicanus, had for two years successively laboured to remove the bars which had, by the conititution of Sylla, been opposed to the abuses of the tribunitian power. They had been strenuously resifted by Lucullus and others, who held the office of Consul, during the dependence of the questions which had arisen on that fubjedt. By the favour of Pompey and CraIfus, however, the Tribunes obtained a relti- tution of the privileges which their predecessors, in former times of the republic, had to often abused; and, together with the security of their sacred and inviolable charadcer, and their negative in all pro- ceedings of the State, they were again permitted to propose laws, and to harangue the people; a dangerous measure, by which Pompey at once ren- dered fruitless that reformation which was the 'only apology for the blood so lavishly shed, not only by Sylla, but likewise by himself. Caius Ju- lius Caesar, at the fame time, having the rank of Legionary Tribune conferred upon him by the public choice, was extremely active in procu- ring those popular ads; a policy in which he was more confilent with himself than Pompey, and only pursued the course of that party with which he had been associated in his earliest years'.

Under this Consulate, and probably with the CHAP.
XVI. encouragement of Pompey, the law of Sylla, re- . speding the judicatures, was, upon the motion of the Prator, Aurelius Cotta, likewise repealed; and it was permitted to the Pr3etors to draught the judges in equal numbers from the Senate, the Lex Aure-- Knights, and a certain class of the People ', whose aria. description is not clearly ascertained. This was, perhaps, a just correcion of Sylla's partiality to the Nobles; and, if it had not been accompanied by the former ad, which restored to the Tribunes powers which they had so often abused, might have merited applause.
In the mean time, corruption spread with a haftl pace; among the lower ranks, in contempt of go- vernment; among the higher, in covetousness and prodigality, with an ardour for lucrative appoint- ments, and the opportunity of extortion in the provinces. As the offices of State at Rome began to be coveted with a view to the employments abroad, to which they conducted, Pompey, in or- der to display his own disinterestedness, with an oblique reproof to the Nobility who aspired to magistracy with such mercenary views, took a for- mal oath in entering on his Consulate, that he would not, at the expiration of his office, accept of any government in the provinces; by this ex- ample of generosity in himself, and by the censure it implied of others, he obtained great credit with the People, and furnished his emiflaries, who w-se

c T P. ever busy in founding his praise, with a pretence XvI.
t . for enhancing his merit. It may, however, from
his character and policy in other instances, be fu- fpeted, that he remained at Rome with intention to watch opportunities of raising his own confider- ation, and of obtaining, by the strength of his party, any extraordinary trust or commiflion of which the occasion should arise.
This adventurer, in the administration of his Consulate, had procured the revival of the Censors functions. These had been intermitted about sixteen years, during great part of which time the republic had been in a slate of civil war; and the prevail- ing parties, in their turns, mutually had recourse to adts of banifhmernt, confiscations, and military ex- ecutions against each other. In such times, even after the fw-eord was sheathcd, the power of Cen- for, in the first heat of party-refentment, could not be safely entrutted with any of the citizens; and the attempts hllich were now made to revive it, though in appearance successful, could not give it a permanent footing in the commonwealth. The public was arrived at a state in which men complain of evils, but cannot endure their reme- dies.
L. Gellius Poplicola and Cn. Cornelius Ientu- 1us, being entruiled, in the charaCter of Censors, with the making up of thc.rolls of the People, muflered four hundred and fifty thousand citizens.
''hey purged the Senate with great severity, hav- Il g eC-unged fixty-four from the number, and 7mong thei, C. Antonius, afterwards Consul, assign-
ing
ing as their reason, that he, having the command c H A P. on the coaits of Asia and Greece, had pillaged the X__, allies, and mortgaged and fquandcred his own. estate. But what most diftinguihed this Censor- ihip was an incident, for the fake of which, it is likely, the folcmnity of the Ccnfus had been now revived.
It was customary on such occasions for the Knights to pass in review, each leading his horcf before the Censors. They were quefRioned refped- ing their age, the number of their campaigns, and the petfons under whole command they had fcrved; and if they had been already on the military lift the ten years preicribed by law, they received an exemption for the future, and vere veited with the privileges which were annexed to this cir- cumftance. At this part of the ceremony the People where surprised to fee their Consul, Pompey tile Great, descending into the market-place, lead- ing his horse in quality of a simple Knight, but dressed in his consular robes, and preceded by the Lidors. Being quefioned by the Ccnfor, wrhethl. he had served the lated number of years, he in-. fwered that he had, and all of them in armie; commanded by himself. This farce was received with loud acclamations of the People; and the Censors having granted the customary exemption, rose from their feats, and, followed by a great multitude of the People, attended this equestrian Confil to his own Ihoelbc T.

c H A P. It is observed that Crafius and Fompey, although
xv . they entered on office in concert, yet differed in
the course of their administration on fubjeds which aie not particularly mentioned. As Craf- sus was in poiReflion of great wealth, he endea- voured, by his liberalities, to vie with the imposing state and popular arts of his colleague. In this view he gave a public entertainment at ten thou- sand tables, and distributed three months provision of corn to the more indigent citizens. To account for his being able to court the People in so sump- tuous a manner, it is said, that having inherited from his father a fortune of three hundred ta- lents, or near sixty thousand pounds; he increased it, by purchasing at a low price the estates of those who were proscribed in the late troubles, and by letting for hire the labour of a numerous family of slaves, initrucded in various arts and callings; and by these means was become so rich, that when, some time after this date, he was about to depart for Asia, and con'ecrated the tenth part of his estate to Herculus, he was found to possess seven thousand one hundred talents, or about one million three hundred and seventy thousand and three hundred pounds Sterling 2.
Pompey, at the expiration of his year in the Consulship, agreeably to the oath he had taken, re- mained at Rome in a private station; but, fill unchanged in his manner, maintained the reserve

and stateliness of a person raised above the con- c HA P. dition of a mere citizen, or even above that of the xvI. first Senators of consular rank. Other candidates for consideration and public honours endeavoured, by their talents and eloquence, to make themselves necessary to those who had affairs to solicit with the public, or even to make themselves feared by those who were obnoxious to the law. They laboured to diftinguifl themselves as able advo- cates or formidable accusers at the bar, and to strengthen their interest by procuring the support of those to whom their talents either were or might become of importance. Pompey, on the contrary, flating himself as an exception to com- mon rules, avoided the courts of justice and other places of ordinary resort, did not commit his ta- lents to the public judgment, nor present his per- son to the public view; took the refpea that was paid to him as a right; seldom went abroad, and never without a numerous train of attendants. He was formed for the fiate of a prince, and might have stolen into that high Rfation even at Rome, if men, born to equality, could have suffered an elevation which no measure of personal merit could at once have procured; or had been willing, when troubled with faction, to forego their own im- portance, in order to obtain peace and the comn- forts of a moderate government. The pretensions of Pompey, however, were extremely disagreeable to the Senate, and not otherwise acceptable, even

c HA P. to the People, than as they tended to mortify the
Xvi. pride of that order of men. U. C. 654. The Consulate of Crassus and Pompey was fuc- Q.Horten- fius, C ceeded by that of Q. Hortenfius and Q. Cacilius creticus Metellus. In the distribution of provinces, Crete,
with the command of an armament to be sent into that island, fell to the lot of Hortenfius; but this citizen, having acquired his consideration by his eloquence in pleading the causes of his friends, and being accustomed to the bar, perhaps in a degree that interfered with the ordinary military character of a Roman officer of State, declined to accept of this government; leaving it, together with the command of the army that was to be employed in the reduEtion of the iftand, to his colleague Metellus, who afterwards received the appellation of Creticus, from the diftination he acquired in this service.
The Cretans, and most of the other seafaring people on the confines of Asia and Europe, had in the late war taken an active part against the Ro- mans. They had, by the influence of Mithri- dates, and by their own disposition to rapine and piracy, been led to prey upon the traders, and upon the carriers of revenue who were frequent- ly pafling to Rome from the provinces. The de- lire of sharing in the profits that were made by this species of war, had filled the lea with pirates and freebooters, against whom the Senate had em- ployed a succession of officers, with extensive com- mands, on the coafss both of Asia and Europe.
Among
Among others, M. Antonius had been sent on this c A P. service, and was accused of abusing his power, by xv_. oppressing the Sicilians, and the people of other maritime provinces, who were innocent of the crimes he was charged to repress. In a defeent on the island of Crete he was defeated and killed 1' and left the Romans engaged with the people of that island in a war which was thought to require the presence of one of the Consuls. And the lot, as has been observed, having fallen on Hortenfius, was transferred to his colleague Metellus.
Such was the state of affairs, and such the defti- u. c. 65.
L. Ca:. nation of the Roman officers, when Lucullus re- Melteus, ceived from Tigranes a return to the demand which "'Iar. he made of having Mithridates delivered up as his prisoner. This prince, at the arrival of Clodius, who bore the meflage, had made a progress to the coasts of Phcenicia, and to the farther extremities of his empire. To verify the state and title which he assumed of King of Kings, he affected, when he mounted on horseback, to have four captive oIvereigns to walk by his stirrup, and obliged them, on other occasions, to perform every office of me- nial duty and servile attendance on his person. Lucullus, initead of the stile which was asseted by this prince, had accosted him in his letter only with the simple title of king. His meltenger, how- ever, was admitted to an audience, and made his demand that Mithridatcc, a vanquifled enmrny, whose territories were ,!r^dv i the OlPlefion of
the : P-i.'.r.r: ! , !] 0i? . . V -°.
c H A P. the Romans, should be delivered up to adorn the x n. vidcor's triumph. This, if refused, said the bearer of
the message, the Roman general would be entitled to extort by force, and would not fail, with a mighty army for that purpose, to pursue his fugi- tive wherever he was received and protected. The king of Armenia, unused even to a plain address, much less to inullt and threats, heard this demand with real indignation; and though, with an ap- pearance of temper, he made offer of the cuftoma- ry presents and honours to the person who deli- vered the metfage, he took his resolution against those from whom it came, and from having bare- ly permitted Mitbridates to take refuge in his kingdom, determined to espouse his cause. He gave for anfwver to Clodius, that he would not de- liver up the unfortunate king, and that, if the Ro- mans invaded his territories, he knew how to de- fend them. He soon afterwards admitted Mithri- dates into his presence, and determined to support him with the necesSary force against his enemies.
Upon receiving this answer from Tigranes, Lu- cullus resolvcd without delay to march into Ar- menia. He chore for this expedition two legions and a body of horse, on whom he prevailed, though with some difficulty, to enter on a new war at a time when they flattered themselves that their la- bours were ended, and that the rewards they ex- pected were within their reach. With hasty mar- ches he arrived on the Euphrates, and pafled that river before the enemy were aware of his approach.
Tigranes
Tigranes treated the first reports of his coming c H A P. with contempt, and ordered the person who pre- xI. fumed to bring such accounts to be puniihed. But being assured, beyond a possibility of doubt, that an enemy was actually on his territories, he sent Metrodorus, one of his generals, at the head of a considerable force, with orders to take alive the person of Lucullus, whom he was desirous to fee, but not to spare a man of the whole army besides.
With these orders, the Armenian general set out on the road by which the Romans were known to advance, and hastened to meet them. Both armies, on the march, had intelligence of each other. Lucullus, upon the approach of the enemy, halted, began to intrench, and, in order to gain time, detached Sextilius, with about three thousand men, to observe the Armenians, and, if possible, without risking an action, to amuse them till his works were completed. But such was the incapacity and presumption of the enemy, that Sextilius, being attacked by them, gained an en- tire vicory with but a part of the Roman army; Metrodorus himself being killed, his army was put to the rout with great slaughter.
After this vitory Lucullus, in order the more effectually to alarm and to diftrad the Armenians, separated his army into three divisions. With one he intercepted and dispersed a body of Arabs, who were marching to join the king ; with another he surprised Tigranes himself, in a disadvantageous iituation, and obliged him to fly with the loss of
his
c H A P. his attendants, equipage, and the baggage of his
_.XV army. At the head of the third division he him-
self advanced to Tigranocerta, and invested that place.
After these disasters Tigranes made an effort to assemble the force of his kingdom; and bringing into the field all the troops of his allies, as well as his own, muttered an army of one hundred and fifty thousand heavy-armed foot, fifty-five thou- sand horse, and twenty thousand archers and fling- ers. He was advised by Mithridates not to risk a battle, but to lay waste the country from which the Romans were supplied with provisions, and there- by oblige them to raise the siege of Triganocerta, and repass the Euphrates, with the disadvantage of having an enemy still in force to hang on their rear. This counsel of Mithridates, founded in the experience he had so dearly bought, was ill suited to the presumption of the king. He there- fore advanced towards the Romans, impatient to relieve his capital, and the principal feat of his magnificence, Lucullus, trusting to the specimens he had already seen of the Armenian armies, ven- tured to divide his force, and, without raising the liege, marched with one division to meet this nu- merous enemy. In the action that followed, the Armenian horse being in the van, were defeated, and driven back on the foot of their own army, threw them into confusion, and gave the Romans an easy victory, in which, with very inconsiderable lois to themselves, they made a great slaughter of
the
the enemy. The king himself, to avoid being c u P- known in his flight, unbound the royal diadem from his head, and left it to become a part in the spoils of the day.
Mariaus, who commanded in Tigranocerta, hearing of his master's defeat, and fearing a re- volt of the Greeks and other foreigners, who had been assembled by force in that settlement, ordered them to be searched and disarmed. This order they looked on as the prelude to a maflacre, and crowd- ing together, defended themselves with the clubs and other weapons they could seize. They fur- rounded a party that was sent to disperse them, and having by that means got a supply of arms, they took poiffeiton of a tower which command- ed one of the principal gates, and from thence in- vited the Romans to enter the place. Lucullus accordingly seized the opportunity, and became malter of the city. The spoil was great; Ti- granes having colleced here, as at the principal feat of his vanity, the wealth and magnificence of his court.
Mithridates, who had been present in the late action, met the king of Armenia in his flight; and, having endeavoured to re-eftablifih his equipage and his retinue by a participation of his own, ex- horted him not to despair, but' to assemble his ar- my anew, and to perlift in the war. They agreed, at the fame time, on an embafly to the king of Parthia, with offers of reconciliation on the part of Tigranes, who, at this time, was at war with
that
c H A P. that prince, and of fatisfadion on the fubjeds in
xv'. . '. contest between them, provided the Parthians
would join in the confederacy againit the Romans. They endeavoured to persuade the king of Par- thia, that he was by no means an unconcerned fpetator in the present conteit; that the quarrel which the Romans now had with the kings of Ar- menia and Pontus, was the fame with that which they formerly had with Philip and with Antio- chus; and which, if not prevented, they would ibon have with Arfaces, and was no other than his being possessed of a rich territory, which tempted their ambition and avarice. Those republicans, they said, originally had not any poffefiions of their own, and were grown rich and great only by the spoils of their neighbours. From their strong-hold in Italy, they had extended their empire on the Wrest to the coast of the ocean; and, if not inter- rupted by the powerful monarchies 'which lay in their way, were hastening to reach a similar boun- dary on the East. The king of Parthia, they added, might expec to be invaded by these insatiable conquerors, and must now determine whether he siould'engage in a war joined with such powerful allies, of whom one by his experience, the other by his resources, might enable him to keep the dan- ger at a distance from his own kingdom r, or wait until these powers being overthrown, and become an acceflion to the Roman force, he should have the contest to maintain in his own territory singly
and x Letter of Mithridatej in the Fragments of Salluut.
and unsupported from abroad. To these repre- CH A P. fentations Arfaces seemed to give a favourable ear, XVIJ agreed to the proposed confederacy, on condition that Mesopotamia, which he had formerly claim- ed, was now delivered up to him. At the fame time he endeavoured to amuse Lucullus with of- sers of alliance againit the king of Armenia.
In this conjuncture, it probably was, that Lu- cullus, in the apprehension of being superseded and deprived of the honour of terminating the war, made his report that the kingdom of Mithri- dates was now in his poffeftion, and that the king- dom of Tigranes was also in his power; and there- fore, that the Senate ihould, instead of a fucceifor, fend the usual commission to fettle the form of the province, and to make a proper establishment to preserve the territories which he had already sub- dued. But after these representations were dif- patched by Lucullus, it became apparent that the king of Parthia had deceived him with false pro- feflions, while he actually made great progress in a treaty with his enemies the kings of Armenia and Pontus, and meant to support them with all his force. In resentment of this ad of treachery, or to prevent the effeds of it, Lucullus proposed to carry the war into Parthia; and, for this purpose, ordered the legions that were flationed in Pontus to march without delay into Armenia.
These troops, however, already tired 'of the ser- vice, and fufpeting that they were intended for tome distant and hazardous enterprise, broke out
into
H A P. into open mutiny, and refused to obey their offi- ,XV_ cers. This example was soon afterwards follow-
ed by other parts of the army; and the gene- ral was obliged to confine his operations to the kingdom of Armenia. He endeavoured, by pas- ing the mountains near to the sources of the Eu- phrates and the Tigris, to penetrate as far as Artax- ata, the capital of the kingdom. By this march he forced Tigranes once more to hazard a battle, and obtained a victory; but his own army, not- withstanding their success, were so much difcou- raged with the change of climate, which they ex- perienced in ascending the mountains of Armenia, and with the early and revere approach of winter in those high lands, that they again mutinied, and obliged their general to change his plan of the war. He accordingly turned his march to the iouthward, fell down on Mesopotamia, and, after a short liege, made himself master of Nifibis, a rich city in that territory, where, with other cap- tives, he took Guras, brother to the king, who comr manded in the place.
Here, however, the mutinous spirit frill continu- ing to operate in the Roman army, it began to ap- pear, that the general, who had so often overcome the kings of Pontes and Armenia, was better qua- lified to contend with an enemy, than to win or to preserve the good-will of his own troops. A report being spread that he was soon to be recall- ed, he, from that moment, loit the small remains of his authority; the legions defeited their co-
lours,
loitrs, and treated, with scorn or indifference, all CHA . the attempts which he made to retain them.
This mutinybegan in that part of the army, which, having been transported into Asia, with the Consul Valerius Flaccus at their head, had mur- dered this general, to put themselves under the com- mand of Fimbria, and afterwards deserted their new leader to join with Sylla. Such crimes, under the late unhappy divisions of the republic, either re mained unpunished, or were stated as merits with the party in whose favour the crime was committed. These legions, however, were, by Sylla, who was not willing to employ such infiruments, or to in- trult his own fate, or that of the commonwealth, in such hands, left in Asia, under pretence of fecu- ring the province; and they accordingly made a considerable part in the armies successively com- manded by Murena and by Lucullus. The difpo- fition which they now exhibited, and that of the army in general, to disorder and mutiny, was great- ly excited by the factious spirit of Publius Clodius. the relation of Lucullus, who, having himself taken offence at the general, gave this earnest of his future conduct in the State, by endeavouring to stir up rebellion among the troops. " We, who " have already undergone so many hardships," lie said, " are fill kept on foot to escort the camcls " which carry the treasures of our general, and are " made to purfuc, without end, a couple of bar-
barous fugitives over barren defirts, and unculti. VOL. II. S " tvit .
H A P. " vated waftes, while the soldiers of Pompey, after -xv ' , " a few campaigns in Spain, or in Italy, are ent-
"joying the fruits of their labour in comfortable " settlements, procured by the favour of their
l' ader." Lucullus was so much aware of the decline of his authority, that he did not venture to hazard an affront by attempting to effect even a mere change of position. He hoped, that while he did not iflue any orders of moment, the resolution of his army not to obey him might remain a secret to the ene- my. This slate of his affairs, however, soon became known to Mithridates, and encouraged him to hope he might be able to recover his kingdom. That he might not susser the opportunity to escape him, he fell back into Pontus, with what troops he had then under his command, and, by his authority and in- fluence over his own fubjeas, soon augmented his force, penetrated among the scattered quarters of the Romans, who were left to occupy the coun- try, and separately surprised or destroyed confide- rable bodies of their troops. Among these, he attacked and defeated Fabius, the officer who was entrusted with the general command; and this king, though now turned of seventy, exposing his own perion in the action, received a wound which flopped him in the pursuit of his victory, and by that means prevented its full effec.
Lucullus, being informed of what had passed in Pontus, had influence enough with the army,
oi0
now anxious for their own safety, to put them in c H A P. motion towards that kingdom; but before his ar- XV' rival, Mithridates had ihut up Fabius in Cabira, and defeated Triarius with considerable slaughter. Here again the veteran monarch was wounded; and, to satisfy the troops that he was not dead, was raised up on a platform, where he remained in fight of the army while his wound was drefled. In this last defeat the Romans loft twenty-four le- gionary Tribunes, one hundred and fifty Centu- rions, and seven thousand men.
It was not doubted, however, that Lucullus, on his arrival, if the men had been disposed to ad under his command, would have been able soon to retrieve his affairs: but he was at this time super- feded; and it was known in the army, that Acilius Glabrio was set out from Rome on his way to fuc-' ceed him. The legions, therefore, under pretence that Lucullus was no longer their general, or that they themselves, by a decree of the People, had received their dismission, refused to obey him; and numbers, in fad, began to disband, taking the route of Cappadocia on their return to Italy.
This was the Rate of affairs when the commis- fioners, who, upon the report of Lullucus, had been sent by the Senate to fettle the kingdom of Pontus in the form of a province, acutally arrived. They found the Proconsul deflitute of power in his own camp, and Mithridates, whom they believed. to be vanquifhied, again in pofifficn of his king-

C H A r. dom, and joining to the experience of old age all

The Roman army in Asia, as a prelude to their present defection, had been taught to contrait the parsimony of Lucullus with the liberality and mu- nificence of Pompey, and from the comparison they made, were impatient to change their leader, a dif- position, which, it is not doubted, Pompey, by his intrigues, and with the aid of his agents, greatly encouraged. He could in reality ill brook the private station to which, by his late oath, in en- tering on the Consulate, he had bound himself. As he ever studied to support the public opinion of his own importance, he wiihed for occasions to derive tome advantage from that opinion; but no- :hing had occurred for twvo years that was worthy ds the high diflindion tp which he aspired. The command in Asia he coveted the more, that it seem- ed to be secured to Lucullus by the splendor of his successes, and by the unanimous judgment of the Senates and Nobles, who knew his faithful attach- ment to their order, and his fidelity to the arifto- cratical part of the conflitution. The difficulties in that fcrvice were over, and nothing but the glory of terminating the war remained. Pompey, either from envy to Lucullus, or from a design to openl a way to this glory for himself, contributed to the appointment of Glabrio, and to She nomina- ;ion of the TrPetors, who were sent with separate commands into the provinces of Asia and Bythi-

nia. If, upon the change he had thus produced, c H A P. the war flould become unsuccessful, or languish, I he had hopes to be called for by the general voice of the People, as the only person fit to bring it to a happy concluiion. Meanwhile a project was started, which was to place him near to this fcenc of action, and, if judged expedient, was likely to facilitate his farther removal, to the command of the army in Pontus.
The pirates frill continued to infest the seas, and were daily rising in their presumption, and in- creasing in' their flrength. They were receiving continual accession of numbers from those, who, by the unsettled state of Asia, were forced to join them for fubfitence. The impunity which they enjoyed during the diftra&ion of councils at Rome, and the profits they made by their depredations, encouraged many who frequented the seas to en- gage in the fame way of lite. They had been chaced, and numbers of them taken by M.' Anto- nius the orator, by Scrvilius Ifauricus, and, last of all, by C. Antonius, the father of him who, in the quality of Triumvir, is to become so conspicuous in the sequel of this history. But they had their retreats; and, upon the leafn remission of vigi- lance in the Roman officers, they again multiplied apace, put to sea in formidable tfquadrons, and embarked such numbers of men, as not only en- abled them to scour the seas, but likewise to make lefcents on the coasts, to enter harbours, destroy Ihipping, and pillage the maritime towns. They
S 3 cove-n
CHA.P. even ventured to appear off the mouth .of the XVs. ^-iL, Tiber, and to plunder the town of Ostia itself.
All the coafls of the empire were open to their depredations. Roman magifirates were made pri- foners in palling to and from their provinces; and citizens of every denomination, when taken by them, were forced to pay ransom, kept in captivity, pr put to death. The supply of provisions to Italy was intercepted, or rendered precarious and dif- ficult, and the price in proportion enhanced. Eve- ry report on these fubjeds was exaggerated by the intrigues of Pompey, who perceived, in this oc- cation of public distress, the object of a pew and extraordinary commission to himself.
Frequent complaints having been made, and frequent deliberations held on this subjed in the Senate, Gabinius, one of the Tribunes, at last pro- posed, that some officer of Consular rank should be veiled, during three years, with absolute powers, in order to put an effectual flop to there outrages, and to eradicate the cause of them, so as to secure for the future the inhabitants of the coast, as well as to protect the navigation of the seas. As Ga- binius was known to be in concert with Pompey, the design of the proposition was manifest; and it was received in the Senate with a general aversion.
For this," it was said, " has Pompey declined " the ordinary turn of Consular duty upon the "expiration of his office, that he might lie in ' wait for extraordinary and illegal appointments." Gabinius being threatened with violence if he
Ihould
should persist in his motion, thought proper to C-H AP. withdraw from the assembly. XV.
A report was immediately spread in the city, that the person of the Tribune Gabinius had been actually violated; multitudes assembled at the doors of.the Senate-houfe, and great disorders were likely to follow; it was judged prudent for the Se- nate to adjourn; and the members, dreading some insult from the populace, retired by sep.arate ways to their own houses. Gabinius, without farther regard to the .difent of the Senate, prepared to carry his motion to the People; but the other nine Tribunes were inclined to oppose him. Tre- bellius and Roscius, in particular, were engaged to put a flop by their negative, to any further pro- ceedings on that business. Pompey, in the mean time, with a dissimulation which conIfituted part of his character, affeded to Aiifapprove the motion of Gabinius, and to decline the commission with which it was proposed to invest him. He had recourse to this affectation, not merely as the fittest means on the present occasion to disarm the envy of the No- bles, and to confirm the People in their choice; but still more as a manner of proceeding which suited his own difpofitionl being no less desirous to appear forced and courted into high situations, than folici- tous to gain and to hold them. He thus provoked the citizens of his own rank, no less by the fhal- low arts which he pradtifed to impose on the pu- blic, than by the fate which he assumed. He could scarcely expecA to find a support in the or-
S 4 der
CH a p. der of Nobles, and lcaft of all among those who _,._.. were likely to become the personal rivals of his
fortune in the commonwealth: and yet it is men- tioned, that Julius Cefar, now about two-and- thirty years of age, and old enough to diftinguifli his natural antagonists in the career of ambition, took part with the creatures of Pompey on this occasion. He was disposed to court the popular sac- tion, and to oppose the aristocracy; either of which principles may explain his conduct in this instance. He had himself already incurred the displeasure of the Senate, but more as a libertine than as a disturber of the State, in which he had not hither- to taken any material part. In common with the youth of his time, he disliked the Senators, on ac- count of the remaining austerity of their manners, no less than the inferior people disliked them on ac- count of their ariftocratical claims to authority and power. But whatever we may suppose to have been his motives, Caxfar, even before he seemed to have formed any ambitious designs of his own, was ever ready to abet those of any desperate adventurer who counteracted the Senate, or set the orders of government at nought; and seemed to be actuated by a species of inflinc, which set him at variance with every form of a civil or political nature, if it checked the licence of faction, or bore hard on disorderly citizens of any fort'.
On the day in which the quelfion respeCting the motion of Gabinius was to be put to the People,
Pompey · 4::?,ra., A:- 'il'. x, c. 3
Pompey appeared in the Comitium; and, if we may c i A P. judge from the speech which is a'cribed to him, v employed a dissimulation and artifice somewhat too gross even for the audience to which it was ad- drelned. He took occasion to thank the People for the honours he had received; but complained, that, having already toiled so much in the public service, he still should be destined for new labours. " You " have forgotten," 'he said, " the dangers I en-
countered, and the fatigues I underwent, while yet almost a boy, in the war with Cinna, in the " wars in Sicily and in Africa, and what I susser-
e( cd in Spain, before I was honoured with any ,' magistracy, or was of age to have a place in the "Senate. But I mean not to accuse you of in- ' gratitude; on the contrary, I have been fully " repaid. Your nomination of me to conducl the ' war with Sertorius, when every one else declin- l' ed the danger, I confider as a favour; and the "extraordinary triumph you bestowed in confe- ' quence of it, as a very great honour. But I " must entreat you to confider, that continued "application and labour exhaust the powers of ' the mind as well as those of the body. Trust ' not to my line of life alone, nor imagine that I " am still a young man, merely because my number
of years is ihort of what others have attained. " Reckon my services and the dangers to which
I have been exposed; they will exceed the "number of my years, and satisfy you, that I ' cannot much longer endure the labours and
" careC
CHAP. "'cares which are now proposed for me. But if
XVI. L "( this be not granted me, I muit beg of you to
" confider what loads of envy such appointments "are likely to draw upon me from men, whose "displeasure, I know, you neither do, nor ought
to regard, although to me their envy might be "fatal: and I confers, that, of all the difficul- " ties and dangers of war, I fear nothing so much " as this. To live with envious persons; to be ' called to account for miscarriage, if one fails " in the public service; and to be envied, if one " succeeds; who would choose to be employ- ( ed on such conditions? For these, and many " other reasons, I pray you to leave me at reft; "leave me to the care of my family, and of my a' private affairs. As for the present service, I (' pray you to choose, among those who desire the "' employment, some person more proper; among " so many, you cannot surely be at a loss. I am " not the only person that loves you, or that has i experience in military affairs. There are many, " whose names, to avoid the imputation of flat- ' tery, I will not mention."
To this speech Gabinius replied; and, affecting to believe the sincerity of Pompey's declarations, observed, that it was agreeable to the character of this great man, neither to desire command, nor raflly to accept of what was pressed upon him.
They who are best able to surmount difficul- "ties," he said, " are likewise least inclined to ' engage in them. But it is your business, fellow-
" citizens,
citizens, to confider, not what is agreeable to CHAP. Pompey, but what is necessary to your own as- V fairs; not to accept of those who court you for offices, but of those who are fit to discharge the ( duties of them. I wifll we had many persons
of this description, besides the man I have propo- "fed to your choice. Did we not all with for
such persons likewise, when we searched among "the young and the old for some one to be oppo- " fed to Sertorius, and found none but himself? " But wifies cannot avail us; we must take men ' as they are; we cannot create them. If there " be but one man formed for our purpose, with "knowledge, experience, and good fortune, we
must lay hold of him, and seize him, if necessary, " even by force. Compulsion here is expedient "and honourable for both parties; for those who " employ it, because it is to find them a person " who can conduct their affairs; for him who " fffers it, because he is to have an opportunity ' of serving his country, an object for which no " good citizen will refuse to expose his person, or ' to sacrifice his life.
" Do you think that Pompey, while yet a boy, was fit to command armies, to protect your al- "lies, to reduce your enemies, to extend your "empire; but that now in the prime of life, ripe "in wisdom and experience, he can serve you no
longer ? You employed the boy, you susser the "man to be idle. When a private citizen of 'Equeffrian rank, he was fit for war and affairs of
" State;
C H A P." State; now he is a Senator, forsooth, he is fit for
xvr. L "_-.( nothing ! Before you had any trial of him, you
" made choice of him for the most important trust; " now that you have experience of his ability, of ' his conduct, and of his success, you hesitate. Is "the present occasion less pressing than the for- " mer? Is the antagonist of Sertorius not fit to *' contend with pirates ? But such absurdities can- < not be received by the Roman People. As for " you Pompey, submit to the will of your fellow,-
citizens. For this you was born, for this you ' was educated. I call upon you as the property " of your country; I call upon you as its safe-
guard and its defence. I call upon you to lay " down your life, if necessary. This I know, if " your country require it, you will not, you can- 4 not refuse.
" But it is ridiculous to accost you in this man- " ner; you who have proved your courage and " your love to your country in so many and fuclh " arduous trials. Be ruled by this great aflembly. " Despise the envy of a few, or study the more to "deserve the general favour. Let the envious " pine when they hear of your ad ions, it is whai " they deserve. Let us be delivered from the ' evils by which we are surrounded, while you ' proceed to end your life as you began it, with ' success and with glory."
When Gabinius had finiflhed his speech, Trc- bellius another of the Tribune%, attempted to re- ply; but such . clamour was immediately railed
by
by the multitude, that he could not be heard. CHAP. He then, by the authority of his office, sorbad the XV. - question; and Gabinius instantly proposed to have the sense of the Tribes, Whether Trebellius had hot forfeited the charalcer of Tribune ? Seventeen Tribes were of this opinion, and the eighteenth would have made the majority, when Trebellius thought proper to withdraw his negative. Ro- fcius, another of the Tribunes, intimated by signs (for he could not be heard) that a second fiould be joined with Pompey in this commission. But the clamour was renewed, and the meeting likely so end in riot and violence. Then all opposition to the motion was dropt. And, in this state of the business, Gabinius, trusting that, in the present hu- mour of the People, no man would dare to oppose the measure, or wilhing to increase the honour of Pompey's nomination, by the seeming concurrence of tome of the more refpeaable citizens, called( upon Catulus, who was then first on the roll of the Senate, to deliver his opinion, and led him up in- ,o the rostra for this purpofc.
This citizen, by the equability of his conduc, aind by his moderation, though in support of the aristocracy, had great authority even with the op- pofite party. He began his speech to the People with profeflions of public zeal, which obliged him to de- liver with plainness what he thought was conducive io their good, and which ;entitled him to a delibe- rate hearing, before they should pronounce on the ,r.its of what 1he wl about to (1lii'Cr. " If you
" lien,"
C H A P. liten," he said, "( something may fill be offered
XVI . to inform your judgment; if you break forth
again into disorders and tumults, your capacity "and good underfianding will avail you nothing.
I must begin with declaring my opinion, that powers so great, and for so long a time as are " now proposed for Pompey, ihould not be com- ' mitted to any tingle citizen whatever.
The precedent is contrary to law, and in it- " self, in the highest degree, dangerous to the *' State. Whence came the usurpations of Marius, " but from the habit of continual command; " from his being put at the head of every army, ' intrufed with every war, and no less than fix "times re-eleced Consul in the space of a few "'years ? What inflamed to such a degree the ar- " rogant spirit of Sylla, but the continual com-
mand of armies, and the exorbitant power or " Didator ? Such is human nature, that in age, as " well as in youth, we are debauched with power; *' and if inured for any time to ad as superiors,
e cannot submit afterwards to the equal and " moderate flation of citizens.
" I speak not with any particular reference to " Pompey; I speak what the law requires, and " lwhat I am sure is for your good. If high office "and public trufl be an honour, every one who "has pretensions should enjoy them in his turn; if ' they be a load or a burden, every one ought to " bear his part. These are the laws ofjuftice and
of republican government. By observing them,
" republics
republics have an advantage over most other CHAP;
XVI. , Rates. By employing many men in their turns, ,
they educate and train many citizens for every department, and have numbers amongst whom they may choose the fittest to serve on every par- ticular emergence. But if we susser one or a " few to engross every office or service of mo- " ment, the lift of those who are qualified for
any such trust will decrease in proportion. If we always recur to the fame person in every try- "ing occasion, we ihall soon have no other per-
f' son to employ. Why were we so much at a ' loss for experienced commanders, when Serto-
rius appeared to threaten Italy with an inva- ' sion ? Because command, for a considerable time "before that period, had been engroifed by a few, ( and those few alone had any experience. Al. "though, therefore, I have the highest opinion "of Pompey's abilities and qualification for this " service, I must prefer to his pretensions the
public utility and the express declaration of the " laws.
"You annually eled Consuls and Praetors: to " what purpose ? to serve the State, or to carry
for a few months the ensigns of power? If to serve the State, why name private persons with "unprecedented commissions, to perform what "your magistrates are either fit to perform, or are "not fit to have been eleced ?

"power of this officer has no bounds, but in re-
f spect to the place in which it is to be exer: " cifed, and to the time during which it is to last. " It is to be exercised within the limits of Italy; "where alone the vitals of the State can be ex- "posed to any great or pressing attack; it is li- ' mited to fix months, a sufficient period in which " to remove the cause of any fidden alarm. But ' this unlimited power, which is sow proposed for (' so lohg a time, and over the whole empire, must " end in calamities, such as this and other nations " have suffered from the ambition and usurpation " of arbitrary and presumptuous men.
" If you bellow unlimited power by sea and by "( land on a tingle man, in what manner is he to " exercise his power? Not by himself in person, "for he cannot be every where present; he must "have lieutenants or substitutes who ad under his " orders. He cannot even attend to what is pas- '; sing at once in Egypt and in Spain, in Africa, in " Syria, and in Greece. If so, then why may not "thofc who are to ad be officers named by you, "and not by any intermediate person; account-
able to you, and not to another; and in the "dangers they run, animated with the profpct of
honour to themselves, not to a person who is un- "neceflrily interposed between them and their
country? Gabinius proposes to invest this officer "with authority to name many lieutenants; I
" pi-.y
.-, pray .you to confider, whether these officers CHIAP, fiould depend upon.any intermediate person, or XVI " upon yourselves alone? and whether there be sus- " ficient cause to suspend all the legal powers, and " to supersede all the magistrates in the common- " wealth, and all the governors of provinces in "every part of your empire, in order to make war ,' on pirates ?"
So much of what Catulus is supposed to have delivered on this occasion is preserved among the fragments of Dion. Cassius '. It is mentioned by others, that the audience expreifed their good-will and refpedt for this Senator in a compliment which they paid to him, probably near the close of his i)peech, when urging some of his former argu- ments, he asked, " If this man to whom alone, by ' thus employing him in every service, you give "an opportunity of acquiring the skill and habits. "of a statesman or soldier, ihould fall, to whom
w ill you next have recourse ?" The People an- fwered, with a general acclamation, 7o yourfelfy. They revered, for a moment, the candour and abi- lity of this eminent citizen, but could not with- Ilanld the arts of Pompey, and the tide of popu- larity, which then ran so high in his favour.
T'his day being far spent in debate, another day was appointed in which to collec the votes, when a decree pafled to 'vest Pompey with the supreme command over all the fleets and armies of the re- public, in every sea without diftincion or limit,

C Hr A p. and on every coast within four hundred stadia, or , Xv . fifty miles of the ihore. This commission took place
in Italy, and extended throughout every province, during three years from the time of the ad being passed.
As Pompey owed these cxtraordinary powers to the Tribune Gabinius, he intended to have em- ployed him next in command to himself; but the law which excluded the Tribunes from fuc- ceeding to any public employment, in the first year after the expiration of their office, flood in the way of this choice; and Pompey did not persist in it.
Upon the publication of an edid investing an of- sicer of so much renown with such mighty powers for restoring the navigation of the seas, corn and every other article of importation at Rome con- fiderably fell in their price. The friends of Pom- pey already triumphed in the success of their measure, and he himself soon after, notwithftand- ing the meanness of the enemy opposed to him, gained much credit by the rapid, decisive and es- fectual measures he took to obtain the end of his appointment. Although it was the middle of winter, a season too rough, even in the Mediter- ranean, for such shipping as was then in use, he gave orders to arm and put to sea as many vefiels as could be collected or fitted out in every mara- time station. In a little time he had returns of two hundred and seventy gallies fit for service, one hundred and twenty thousand foot, and four thou- sand horse embodied within the limits to which his
commission
commission extended. That the pirates might be c H A P.' every where attacked at once, and find no refuge by ^,XVI changing their usual places of retreat, he divided the coasts of the empire into separate diftrids, appoint- ed lieutenants with full powers in each, afligned their flations, and allotted their quotas of ihipping and troops. He himself, with a squadron of lixty Ihips, proposed to inlped the whole, or to give his pretence where it ihould be required. He began with visiting the ports of Spain and Gaul, and the seas of Sardinia and Corsica; and in passing from thence, he himself went on flore, and travelled by land, while his squadron, coasting round the penin- fula of Italy, had orders to join him at Brundisium. In this j6urney, upon his approach to Rome, he en- joyed, in all refpeds, the Ilate of a great monarch, was received with acclamations by the People, and was courted by multitudes of every condition who went forth to receive him. All his complaints and representations were received as commands. The Consul Pifo, being supposed not to forward his le- vies with sufficient alacrity, would have been de- graded, if Pompey himself had not interposed to prevent a motion which the Tribune Gabinius in- tended to make for this purpose.
The fleet being arrived at Brundisium, Pompey hastened to reimbark, and from thence paifed by the Rfations of his several lieutenants in the sea-ports of Macedonia and Greece, to those of Pamphylia and Cilicia, which were the principal resort of the pirates. Such of theie banditti, as he captured in his
T z way,
'CH A P. way, were treated with mildness; and this ci'- ,i " ,cumfrance, together with the great preparations
which were reported from every quarter to be making against them, with the small hopes they had of being able to escape, induced them, in great numbers, to surrender themselves. In the bay of Cilicia he found a squadron of their ships as- fembled, and ready to cover the harbours at which they had been accuflomed to collect their naval itores, and to lodge their booty. They separated, however, upon his appearance, took refuge in dif- ferent creeks of that mountainous fiore, and as- terwards surrendered at discretion, delivering up ail the forts they had eredted, with all their flores of timber, cordage, and fails, of which they had made a considerable provision.
By these means the war was finished about the middle of summer, fix months after the nomina- tion of Pompcy to this command. In that time leventy-two gallies were funk, three hundred and iix were taken, and a hundred and twenty pirati- cal harbours or firong-holds on fior were de- flroyed. Ten thousand of the pirates were killed in action, and twenty thousand, who had furren- dered themselves, remained prisoners at the end of the war. These Pompey, having fufliciently de- prived of the means of returning to their former way of life, transplanted to different parts of the continent,where the late or present troubles, by thin- ning the inhabitants, had made room mfr their set- tlement. Upon this occasion he repeopled the city
of
of Soli in Cilicia, which had been lately laid waste, c H A P.
xv'. and forcibly emptied of its inhabitants by Ti- xv__ granes, to replenish his newly eftablifled capital of Tigranocerta in Armenia. After this re-establish- ment of Soli, the place, in honour of its restorer, came to be known by the name of Pompeiopolis l.
Whilst this successful commissioner was thus em- ployed in disposing of the pirates on the coast of Cilicia, he received a mesSage from Lappa in the island of Crete, then besieged by Metellus, inti- mating that the people of this place, although they held out against Metellus, were willing to furren- der to Pompey. This fort of preference implying estimation and popular regard, was one of the temptations which Pompey was supposed unable to retift; he accordingly, without consulting with Metellus, sent an officer to receive the surrender of Lappa.
Mctellus had commanded about two years in Crete, had almost reduced the island, and had a near profpece of that triumph, which he after- wards, with the title of Creticus, actually obtain- ed, on account of this conquefl. Pompey's com- mifilon, as commander in chief of all the sea and land forces of Rome within fifty miles of the coast, no doubt, extended to Lappa; but it was justly reckoned invidious to interfere in the province of a Proconsul, whose appointment preceded his own. And this ftep revived all the former impu- tations against him, that he confidered himself as every one's superior, strove to suppress every grow-
T 3 ing x Dion. Caflisr, lib, xxxvi. c. 2Q.
c H A P. ing fame, and threw his personal consideration as
,Y' , a bar in the way of every rising merit. Metellus,
flung with resentment, and trufling to the support of the Senate, ventured to contemn his orders; even after Od2avius, who had been sent by Pompey to take the inhabitants of Lappa under his protec- tion, had entered the town, and in his name com- manded Metellus to desist from the attack of a place already in pofneffion of the Romans. He nevertheless continued the siege, forced the town to surrender, and threatening to treat Octavius him- self as a rebel, obliged him to be gone from the island. The Senate, without otherwise deciding the controversy which was likely to arise on this sub- jecd, afterwards acknowledged Metellus as the con- queror of Crete, and decreed him a triumph in that capacity '.
The dispute, however, at this time, might have led to disagreeable consequences, if Pompey, while he was preparing to pass into Crete against Me- tellus, had not found another object of more im- portance to his plan of greatness . Lucullus had always appeared to him a rival in power and con- fideration more formidable than Metellus, and the war in Pontus and Armenia, likely to furniflh a more ample field of glory than the deftrudion of pirates.
Mithridates, though once nearly vanquiffied, was, by means of the diftracions which, commu-
nicatinc x Liv. Epit. Ftltarch in Polnpeio. Dion. Cat lib. xxxv. . Dion. Car lib. xxxvi. i. sS.
nicating from the popular factions at Rome, had c H A P. infected the army of Lucullus, enabled to renew X the war with frefli vigour. Knowing that the Ro- man general was no longer obeyed, he not only ob- tained possession, as has been mentioned, of his own kingdom, but, together with Tigranes, began to adt on the offensive, and made excursions even into Ci- licia. Acilius Glabrio, the Proconsul appointed to succeed in the command of the Roman army, hear- ing the bad state of affairs in Pontus, flopped short in Bithynia, and even refused to furnish Lucullus with the reinforcements he had brought from Ita- ly. In there circumstances the province of Asia, likely to become a principal source of revenue to the commonwealth, was in imminent danger of being wreIted from their hands; and the friends of Pompey seized this opportunity to propose a farther enlargement of his powrers. Manilius, one of the Tribunes, in concert with Gabinius, moved the People to extend his commission to the provinces of Phrygia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Pontus; and of'courfe to commit the war in Armenia and Pontus to his diredion. This motion was ftrenu- oufly opposed by Catulus, Hortenlius, and all the principal members of the Senate. It was support- ed by Marcus Tullius Cicero and by Caius Julius Cafar, who both intended, on this occasion, to court the popular party, by espousing the cause of a person so much in favour with the People.
Cicero was one of the firit of the Romans who refted his consideration entirely on civil accomplish-
T 4 ments,
HA P. ments, and who became great by the services he '-h U was qualified to render his friends in a civil capa-
city, without any pretensions to the merit of a fol- dier. The character of a pleader was become one of the moif powerful recommendations to public .notice, and one of the surest roads to consequence and civil preferment. Cicero, with a fine genius .and great application, was supposed to excel all who had gone before him in this line of pursuit. His talents were powerful instruments in his own hands; they rendered him necessary to others, and procured him the court(hip of every party in its turn. lie was underitood to favour the ariftocra- cy, and was inclined to support the Senate, as the great bulwark' of the State, against the licence of the populace, and the violence of fac'ious leaders. But being now Prator, with a near profpccR of the Consulate, he sacrificed much to his ambition in -the pursuit of preferments, which wlere new in his family, and whichl the antient nobility were difpo- ied to envy. His speech, upon the motion of Mani- lius, was the first he had -ever made in a political character: it is still extant, and does more honour to his talents as a pleader, than to his steadiness in support of the constitution and government of his country'. He turned aside, by artful evasions, the wife counsels of Hortenfius and Cattlus; and, un- der pretence of setting forth the merits of Pom- pey, and of' fating precedents in his favour, daz- ;led his audience, by enumerating the irregular
honours j Cicer. Orat. pro Lcgc iMailia .
honours which they themselves had already con- HAP. ferred on this objec of their favour.
With such able advocates, in a cause to which the People were already so well disposed, the ihte- reft of Pompey could not miscarry; and an addi- tion was accordingly made to his former commis- sion, by which he became in reality sovereign of .the fairest part of the empire. Upon the arrival of this news in Cilicia, where he then was, he as- feted surprise and displeasure. " Are my ene- " mies," he said, " never to give me any respite C from war and trouble ?" He had talents, un- doubtedly, sufficient to support him in the use of means less indirect; but a disposition to artifice, like every other ruling paflion, will stifle the plain- *.et fuggcftions of reason, and seems to have made him forget, on the present occasion, that his own attendants at least had common penetration. They turned away from the farce which he acted with flame and disgust '; and he himfclf made no delay in showing the avidity with which he received what he thus affected to dislike; laid aside all thoughts of other business; immediately dispatch- ed his orders to all the provinces that were now subjected to his power; and, without passing his mandates through the hands of Lucullus, summon- ed Mithridates, then with an army of between thirty and forty thousand men on the frontier of Pontus, to surrender himself at discretion. This prince, being then in treaty with Phraates, who
had , I Phltarch. in Pompeio,
aAPr. had lately succeeded his father Arfaces in the -XV' kingdom of Parthia, and being in expectation of
a powerful support from that quarter, refused to liften to this imperious mefnage: and being difap. pointed in his hopes of assistance from the Par- thians, and finding that Phraates had joined in a league with his enemies, he endeavoured to pacify the Roman general; and finding that his advances for this purpose had no effec, he prepared for a vigorous reiiftance.
Pompey set out for Pontus, and in his way had an interview with Lueullus, who was then in Ga-. latia. They accosted each other at first with la- boured expressions of refped and of compliment on their respective services, but ended with dif- putes and sharp altercations. Pompey accused Lucullus of precipitation, in flating the kingdom of Pontus as a PRoman province, while the king himself was alive and at liberty. Lucullus sus- pec6ed that the late mutiny had been fomented by the emissaries of Pompey, to make way for his own succession to the command. He persisted in maintaining the propriety of the report which he had made to the Senate, and in which he had re- presented the kingdom of Pontus as conquered, and in which he had desired that commissioners should be sent as usual to secure the poffefion; observed that no province could be kept, if the troops Rationed to preserve it refused to obey their general; that if fich disorders wcre made the en- gine of politics in the competition of candidates
for
for office, the republic had worse consequences cHAP. to fear than the loss of any diitant province; that xv' although the fugitive king had taken advantage of the factions at Rome and in the army, to put him- self again at the head of some forces, he had not recovered any considerable portion of his kingdom, nor at the arrival of the commissioners of the Se- nate, been able to disturb them in fettling the pro- vince; that there was then nothing left for a fuc- ceflor, but the invidious task of snatching at the glory which had been won by another.
From this conference Pompey entered on the command with many indications of animosity to Lucullus; he suspended the execution of his or- ders; changed the plan of his operations; remit- ted the puniflments, and recalled the rewards he had decreed to particular persons, and in a manner which seemed to justify the suspicion of his having encouraged the late disorders, suffered them to pass with impunity; and treated with the usual confidence even the legions which had refused to obey the orders of their general. His own au- thority, in the outset, seemed to be secured by the animosity of the army to their late commander, and by their desire to contrafi their own conduct, and the success of the war under their present leader, with that which had taken place under his predecefior. Finding hinmfelf, therefore, at the head of numecrous and well-affeced forces, both by sea and by land, he covered the coasts of the .1'gean and Euxine Scas with his galleys, and,
at
C HA F. at the head of a great army, advanced in fcarch of
XVI.
, the enemy.
Mithridates, upon the approach of Pompey, continued retiring before him towards the LefTer Armenia, laid waste the country through which the Roman army was to pass, endeavouring to distress them by the want of provisions and forage.
For several days fuccefively the armies encamp- ed in fight of each other. Mithridates took his posts in such a manner, that he could not be safely at- tacked; and as his objec was to pass the Euphrates without being forced to a battle, he generally le- camped in the night, and, by his superior knowledge of the country, passed through ways in which the Roman army could not hastily follow without ma- nifeft danger of surprise. Pompey, sensible that, upon this plan of operation, the- king of Pontus muff effec&l his retreat, took a resolution to pass him by a forced march, not in the night but in the heat.of the day, when the troops of Asia were molt inclined to repose. If he should succeed in this design, and get betwreen their army and the Euphrates, he hoped to force them to a battle, or oblige them to change their route. According- vl, on the day he had chosen for this attempt, he doubled his march, paired the enemy's camp at noon-day unobserved, and was actually potled on their route, when they began to decamp, as usual, on the following night. In the encounter which followed, having all the advantages of a surprise, :ind in the dark, against an army on its march, and
little
little accustomed to order, he gained a decisive c H-A p. vitory, in which he cut off or dispersed all the XVI. forces on which the king of Pontus had relied for the defence of his kingdom I.
Mithridates escaped with a few attendants; and, in this extremity, proposed to throw himself again into the arms of Tigranes; but was refused by this prince, who was himself then attacked by a rebellion of his own son. Upon this disappoint- ment he fled to the northward, passing by the sources of the Euphrates to the kingdom of Col- chis, and from thence, by the eastern coasts of the Euxine, to the Scythian Bosphorus, now the Straits of CosTa, in order to take refuge in the Cherfone- sus, or Crim Tartary, at Panticapea, the capital of a kingdom which he himself had acquired, and which he had bestowed on Machares, one of his sons. Upon his presenting himself at this place, he found that Machares had long iince abandoned his father's fortunes; and, upon hear- ing of the ill itate of his affairs on his sirs flight from Lucullus into Armenia, had sent, as an of fering or peace, a golden crown to that general, and lsed for the protedion of the Romans. The father, highly provoked with this act of pufilani- mity or treachery, aflembled a force among his Scythian allies, and, deaf to all offers of fubmiflion or entreaties of this undutiful son, dragged him from the throne, and either ordered him to be put to death, or made his situation io painful, that he thought proper to put an end to his own !it.
In.
C H A P. In this manner Mithridates entered anew on
I_., the possession of a kingdom, in which he had not
only a safe retreat, but likewise the means of exe- cuting new projects of war against his enemies. By the maxims of the Romans, which Pompey himself had urged in his late dispute with Lucul. lus, no kingdom was supposed to be conquered, till the king was either killed, taken, or forced to surrender; and the Roman general, by this flight of the king of Pontus, found himself un- der a necessity either of pursuing him into his present retreat, or of doing what he himself had blamed in his predecessor, by making his report of a conquest before it was fully accomplished. While he was deliberating on the measures to be taken in these circumitances, he was invited by the younger Tigranes, son to the king of Armenia, then in re- bellion against his father, to enter with his army in- to that kingdom, and to give judgment on the dif- ferences subsisting between the father and the son.
In consequence of this invitation, Pompey marched into Armenia, joined the rebel prince, and, under pretence of supporting the son, was about to firip the father of his kingdom, when this monarch, as usual, with a meanness propor- tioned to the presumption with which he had en- joyed his prosperity, now resolved to cait himself entirely upon the vidcor's mercy. For this pur- ri'e he desired to be admitted into Pompey's pre- iJnce, and, with a few attendants, presented him- fl- ftor this purpose. Being told, at the entrance
n t,'
of the camp, that no itranger could pass on horse- c H A P. back, he dismounted, and was conducted on foot - to the general's pretence. In entering the tent, he uncovered his head, and having the diadem in his hand, offered to lay it on the ground at Pompey's feet; but was told with great courte- fy, that he might resume it; that, by submitting himself to the generosity of the Romans, he had not loit a kingdom, but gained a faithful ally '. At the fame time, under pretence of reimbursing the expence of the war, a fum of fix thousand ta- lents, or about one million one hundred and twen- ty-eight thousand pounds fierling was exaded from him; and he himself, to this great fum which was paid to the State, added a gratuity to the ar- my of a talent ' to each of the Tribunes, ten mi- nae 3 to each of the Centurions, and half a mina 4 to each private man.
Pompey, in disposing of the two Armenias, which were now in his power, allotted Sophene, or the Lesser Armenia, on the right of the Euphrates, to Tigranes the son, reserving Syria and Phoenicia, to which Antiochus, the last representative of the Macedonian line, had been restored by Lucullus, together with Cilicia and Galatia, to the disposal of the Romans.
Tigranes the father with great fubmiflion ac- quiefced in this partition ; but the son, who pro-

c n Ap. bably expeced to have been put in poffeflion of
XVI the whole of his father's kingdom, was greatly dif-
contented, and, while Pompey was yet in Arme- nia, entered into a correspondence with the king of Parthia, and solicitcd his aflifance to overturn the settlement which was now made. On account of these practices, whether real or supposed, this un- dutiful son of Tigranes was taken into cuflody, carried into Italy, and made a part in the orna- ments of the victor's triumph '.
The Roman general, having in this manner dif- posed of the kingdom of Armenia, or retained it still farther at the disposal of the Romans, by the con- finement of the rebel prince, resumed the thoughts of pursuing Mithridates into his preient retreat. For this purpose he left Afranius in Armenia, with a force fuficient to secure his rear, and to prevent any disturbance on this fide of the Euphrates. He himself pased the Araxes, and wintered on the Cyrus, or the Cyrnus, on the confines of Albania and Iberia. In the following summer, having de- feated the natives of those countries in repeated encounters, he advanced to the mouth of the Pha- sis, where he was joined by his fleet, then plying in the Euxine Sea, under the command of Servi- lius. Here he appears to have deliberated, whe- ther he should attempt to purfuc Mithridates any farther; but upon confidering the difficulties of the voyage, and of the march along a coast and a coun- try entirely unknol n, unfurnilhcd with any fate

XVI. subsistence to his army'by land, he took his refo- lution to return, and to avail himself, in the best manner he was able, of the dominions which had been abandoned to him by the flight of their king'. With this resolution he directed his march, by the coast, back into the kingdom of Pontus; and, find- ing no refiflance, took all his measures as in a con- quered province. At one place he found a con- lideralle treasure,- which was disclosed to him by Stratonice, one of the concubines of the king, by whom she had a son named Xiphares. This wo; manl made the discovery on condition that; if her son were taken by the Romans, his life should be spared. But this unhappy son was exposed to other dangers besides those now apprehended by the mother. Mithridates, upon hearing of the price which was paid for the life of Xiphares, or- dered him to be slain. " That woman," he said, "fllould have likewise bargained with me in fa+ " vour of her son." At other places the Roman army found the vefliges of great magnificence, joined to monuments of superstition and of cruelty. They found some produtions of an art, in which the king was supposed to be master, relating to the compolition of poisons, and of their antidotes, and some records of dreams, together with the inter- pretations I, which had been given by his women.
From Pontus, Pompey, having made a proper disposition of the fleet in the Euxine, to defend the

. tes, whose forces were still formidable on the Bof-
phorus and the opposite shores, set out for the kingdom of Syria, which he now determined to seize in behalf of the Romans. Lucullus had al- ready, agreeably to the policy of his country, or under pretence.of fetting-the Syrians free, fepara- ted their kingdom from the other possessions of Ti- granes: but.tthe pretence upon which he ated in this matter being sufficient to prevent his seizing upon Syria as a Roman province, he was content, in the mean time, with restoring it to Antiochus, the last pretender of the Macedonian line, who had lived eighteen years in -the greatest obscurity in Cilicia. But Pompey now proposed to complete the tranfaclion, by seizing for. the Romans them- selves, what the other asseted' only to restore to the lawful owner r; and this; owner now pleaded in vain against the senten'ce of Pompey.that right of descent from the Macedonian line, which Lu- cullus had employed to ftipplant Tigranes 2.
On the march.into Syria, the Roman general, either in person or by his lieutenants, received the submission of all the principalities or diftricds in his way, and made the following arrange- ·*ments. The Lesser Armenia, once intended for the younger Tigranes, he gave to Dejotarus, king of Galatia 3, -who remained on the frontier of the empire a.faithful dependent, and wvhofe pof- sessions served as a barrier against hostile inva-
sions r Juftin. lib. xl. c. r. & 2. n Appia'n. in Mititridat. p. 244. 5. Eutropi'i', lil, vi.
lions from that quarter. Paphlagonia was given H A P. to Attalus and Pylaemenus, who were liberal xv., triubtaries to the Roman officers, and vigilant guards on the frontiers of the empire. Upon his arrival at Dainafcus, he had many applica- tions from the late fubjeas or dependents of the Syrian monarchy; among others, from Hyrcanus and Ariftobulus, two brothers contending for the sovereignty of Judea, who now repaired to his tri- bunal for judgment, and requested the interpofi- tion of his power in behalf of the party he should be pleated to favour.
Of these rivals, who were the sons of Alexan- der, late high-prieft of the Jews, Hyrcanus the el- der had succeeded to his mother Alexandra, whom the father had left his immediate successor in the kingdom; but was difpofTiefed by his younger brother Ariftobulus, who, being of a more active spirit, had formed a powerful fadcion against him among the people.
Hyrcanus took refitge among the Arabs, and prevailed upon Aretas, the chieftain of some power- ful tribe of that people, to assist 'him in recover- ing the sovereignty of his country. In conjunc- tion with this ally, Hyrcanus accordingly laid siege to Jerusalem, but was disappointed of his ob- jet by Scaurus, one of Pompey's lieutenants, who being then in Syria, interposed at the request of Xkriftobulus, fromn whom he received a prefcnt of three hundred ta!lets , and obliged the Arabs
I2T 3 tto i A';ou : . 5 . ****
:HAP. to defitl from their enterprize. Upon the arri-
-';. val of Gabinius, whom Pompey had sent before
him into Syria, Ariftobulus thought proper to make him likewise a present of fifty talents, and by these means remained in poifeffion of Jerusalem at the arrival of Pompey.
It is alleged that each of the contending parties made their presents also to the Proconsul him- self; Hyrcanus in particular, that of a beautiful piece of plate, admired for its workmanship and weight, being the model of a spreading vine, with its leaves and fruit in massy gold ; and such presents merit attention, as they furnilh some inltances of the manner in which great riches. now in so much request at Rome, were amafled by Roman officers in the course of their services. Be- fides what they obtained in this manner, it is likely that every conquest they effected, every revolution they brought about, and every protection they granted, was extremely profitable.
Pompey, on hearing the merits of the question between the two brothers, notwithstanding what his lieutenants had done for Ariftobulus, declared for Hyrcanus, and advanced towards the city of Jerusalem, to execute the decree he had passed. Upon his approach he was again met by Ariftobu- lus, who made fresh offers of fubmiflion, and of a public contribution in money; and Gabinius was detached, to take possession of the city, in terms of this submission. But upon a report that the
friencis I Joseph. Antiq. lib. xiv. c. z.
friends of Arifiobulus, though himself still in the H A P. hands of Pompey, refused to admit the Roman de- XV. tachment, this prince was put in arrest, and the whole army advanced to the walls.
The citizens being divided, those who espoused the cause of Hyrcanus prepared to open the gates of the city, while the others, who were attached to Ariftobulus, retired into the temple, and broke down the bridge by which this edifice was joined to the tfreets, and made every other preparation in that retreat to defend themselves to the last ex- tremity.
The Romans, upon the arrival of Pompey, bc- ing joined by the friends of Hyrcanus, took pof- session of all the principal stations within the walls, and prepared to attack the temple, into which their antagonifis had retired. This building had all the advantages of a citadel or fortess, built on a height, surrounded with natural precipices, or with a deep ditch overhung with lofty battlements and towers. To reduce it, Pompey sent for battering engines to Tyre, and cut down all the woods in the neighbourhood to furnish materials for the works he was about to erecd. All his attempts being, with great obstinacy, resifted by those who had taken refuge in the Temple. He observed, in the course of his operations, that the people within, although they at all times defended their own persons, when attacked, yet on the Sabbath- day they did no work, either in repairing any of
U 3 their
CH A p. their own .defences, in obfrucing or attempting
V to demolifli what the besiegers were ereting. He
accordingly took advantage of this circumstance, made no afiaults on that day, but continued his labour in filling up the ditch, and ereAed such works as were required to cover his approach. In this manner his towers, without interruption, were raised to the level of the battlements, and his en- gi;es playing from thence, made great havock an:!ilg the belieged. These devotees, however, animlated with zeal in defence of their Temple, even under the discharge of the enemy's misfiles, still continued at the altar to perform their usual ries; and took so little precaution against the dangers to which they were exposed, that num- bers perished in offering up the sacrifices, and mingled their blood with that of the vidtims.
In the third month after the siege began, one of the towers of the Temple was brought in ruin to the ground; and Fauflus, the son of Sylla, with two Centurions at the head of the divisions they commanded, entered the breach, and putting all whom they met to the sword, made way for more numerous parties to follow them, and covered the avenues and porches of the Temple with the slain. The priests, who were even then employed in the sacrifices, waited for the enemy with the utmost compoftire, and, without discontinuing their duties, were slain at the altars. Numbers of the people threw themselves from the precipices; and others, setting fire to the booths in which they had lodged !under the walls of the Temple, were consumed in
the
the flames. About twelve or thirteen thousand pe- c H A P.
XVI. rifhed on this occasion, without any proportional xo. loss to the besiegers, or to those who conduced the itorm.
Pompey, being master of the Temple, and struck with the obstinate valour with which it had been defended, had much curiolity to visit the interior recess, for the fake of which he was told that so much blood had been shed, and all his efforts with- stood with so much desperation. This place, into which no one was ever admitted, betides the high- priest, he supposed to contain the sacred emblems of that power who inspired his votaries with so ar- dent and so unconquerable a zeal. And he ven- tured, to the equal consternation and horror of his own party among the Jews, as of those who oppo- fed him, to enter with his usual attendance into the Holy of Holies. He found it adorned with lamps, candlesticks, cups, vessels of incense, with their supports, all of solid gold, containing a mars of the richest perfumes, and a sacred treasure of two thousand talents ,.
Having satisfied his curiosity, it is mentioned that he refpceed the religion of the place so much as to have left every part of this treasure untouch- ed, and to have given direCtions that the Temple itself should be purified, in order:to expiate the profanation of which he himself had been guil- ty. He reflored Hyrcanus to the priesthood or £overeignty of Judea, but charged him with a
U 4 considerable L Ab1put 1'.. 3S5,=:
cH A P. considerable tribute to the Romans, and at the * . , fame time stript the nation of all those possessions
or dependencies in Palestine and Celefyria, which had been acquired or held in fubjedion by their ancestors. Such were Gadara, Scythopolis, Hyp- pus, Pella, Samaria, Marissa, Azotus, Jamana, Are- thufa, Gaza, Joppa, and Dora, with what was then called Strato's Tower, and afterwards Cafarea. *Under pretence of restoring these several places to their liberties, they were released from their sub- jetion to the Jews, but in reality annexed to the Roman province of Syria '.
Pompey now recollecting that he had formerly carried his arms to the shores of the Atlantic, and to the boundaries of Numidia and of Spain; that he had recently penetrated to the coasts of the Euxine, and to the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea; in order that he might not leave any part of the known world unexplored by his arms, now formed a projet to finish this round of exploits, by visiting the shores of the Aliatic or Eastern Ocean: a circumstance which was to complete the glory of his approaching triumph, and raise him, as his flatterers were pleated to observe, to a rank a- bove every conqueror of the present or any prece- ding age '.
But while the Roman Proconsul was employed in the settlement of Syria, in the reduction of Jeru- falem, and meditating there farther conquefis, Mi-
thridates T Joseph. de Bell. Jud. lib. i. & vii. & Ant. lib. xiv. c. 6. Plut'arch. in Por1. p. 463,
thridates was busy in making preparations to re- c H A P. new the war. Having heard of the extremities to xv which the citizens of Rome had been frequently reduced by invasions from Gaul and Africa, and by the infurretions of their. own fubjeds and slaves, he concluded' that they were weakest at home, or might'be attacked with the greatest advantage in Italy.: He again, therefore, resumed the projet of marching an army of Scythians by the Danube and the Alps. He: visited all the princes in his neighbourhood, made alliances with many, which he confirmed by giving to some of them his daugh- ters in marriage, and persuaded them, by the hopes of a plentiful spoil, to join with him in the pro- jet of invading Europe. He even dispatched his agents into Gaul, to secure the co-operation of na- tions on that fide of the world, and trusted that, on his appearance in Italy, many of the difcon- tented inhabitants would become of his party, in the fame manner as they had declared for Hanni- bal; and that the slaves, so lately at open war with their masters, would likewise be a plentiful sup- ply of recruits to his army.
These projects, however, appeared to his own nation too hazardous and vast. They were suited to the state of a king who wished to perish with splendor; but not to that of fubjets and followers who had humbler hopes, and who chore to be go- verned by more reasonable profpeAs of fortune. The king himself, while he meditated such exten-. five designs, being confined by an ulcer in his face,
had
C H AP. had been for a considerable time concealed from
XVI -vi' public view, and had not admitted any petfon to
his pretence besides some favourite Eunuchs. The minds of his fubjecds, and of his own family in par- ticular, were much alienated from him by the late ats of barbarous severity against Machares and Xiphares, two of his own children, who, with some others, as we have mentioned, had incurred his re- fentment.
Pharnaces, another son, still attended the fa- ther; and, though disposed to betray him, was much in his confidence. The people of Phanagoria, a town on the shore of the Bosphorus, opposite to the fortress at which the king now resided, toge. ther with the inhabitants of the country, pretend- ing a variety of provocations, revolted and the army, during his confinement, losing the usual awe of his person- mutinied, and acknowledg- ed Pharnaces for king. They aflembled round the fcrtrefs in which Mithridates was lodged, and which he had garrisoned with a chosen body of men. When he appeared on the battlements, and desired to know their demands: " To exchange "' you," they said, " for Pharnaces ; an old king " for a young one." Even while he received this answer, and while many of his guards deserted him, he still hoped that, if he were at liberty, he might retrieve his affairs. He desired, therefore, by repeated messages, to know whether he might have leave to depart in safety? But none of the messen- gers he lent with this queflion being suffered to re-
turnr
turn, he apprehended that there was a design to CHAP. deliver him up into the hands of the Romans. XI. Under this apprehension he had recourse to his last resort, a dose of poison, which, it is said, he always carried for use in the scabbard of his fwvord. Being to apply this sovereign remedy for all his evils, he dismissed, with expressions of kindness and gratitude, such of his attendants as itill continued faithful to him; and being left with two of his daughters, who earnestly delired to die with their father, he allowed them to share in the draught, he had prepared and saw them ex- pire. But the portion which remained for himself not being likely to overcome the vigour of his con- ftitution, or, as was believed in those credulous times, being too powerfully counteracted by the es- fed of so many antidotes as he had taken against poison, he ordered a faithful slave who attended him, to perform with his sword what was in those times accounted the highest proof, as it was the last adt, of fidelity in a servant to his master.
Accounts of this event were brought to Pom- pey, while his army was encamped at the dif- tance of some days march from the. capital of Ju- dea, in his way to Arabia. The meflengers ap. peared carrying wreaths of laurel on the points of their spears; and the army, crowding around their general to learn the tidings, were informed of the death of Mithridates. This they received with acclamations, and immediately proceeded to nmake all the ordinary demonstrations of joy. Pom-
pey
c H A. pey himself, having now accomplished the prin-
XVI. cipal objeEt of the war, dropped his design on
Arabia, and direded the march of his army to- wards Pontus. Here he received the submission of Pharnaces, and, with many other gifts, was presented with the embalmed corpse of the king. The whole army crowded to fee it, examined the features and the scars, testifying, by these last es- feds of their curiosity, the refped which they en- tertained for this extraordinary man. He had, with ihort intervals, occupied the arms of the Ro- mans during forty years; and, though he could not bring the natives of Asia to match the legions of Rome, yet he frequently, by the superiority of his own genius, being firm in distress, rose from misfortune with new and unexpected re- sources. He was tall, and of a vigorous conftitu- tion, addicted to women, and, though superior to every other fort of fedution, to this his ardent and impetuous spirit made him a frequent and an easy prey. He appears to have loved and trusted many of that sex with a boundless passion. By some of them he was followed in the field; others he dif- tributed in his different palaces; had many chil- dren, and although, even towards his own sons, as well as towards every one else, on occasions which alarmed the jealousy of his crown, he was sanguinary and inexorable, yet in general he ap- pears to have entertained more parental affection than commonly attends the polygamy of Asiatic princes.
Pompey
Pompey proceeded to fettle the remainder of c A P. his conquests; and, belides the arrangements al- XV. ready mentioned, annexed the kingdom of Pontus to the province of Bithynia, gave the Bosphorus to Pharnaces, and put the province of Syria, extend- ing to the frontier of Egypt, under the govern- ment of Scaurus. He had now, from the time of his appointment to succeed Lucullus, for about three years, had the sole direction of the affairs of the Romans in Asia ; and had exchanged with the king of Parthia .provoking meflages, which, in a different conjuncure, might have led to im- mediate hostilities. But the circumitances were not yet ripe for such a measure, and Pompey had provided sufficient materials for a triumph, with- out attempting to eeak through those boundaries on which so many Roman generals were doomed to disappointment, and on which the progress of the empire itself was destined to stop.
Without entertaining any farther projects for the present, he set out with two legions on the route of Cilicia towards Europe, having Tigranes, ton to the king of Armenia, together with Arif- tobulus, late usurper of the Jewish throne, with his family, two sons and two daughters, as cap- tives to adorn his triumph .

Sb.A.u. began to run high against the ariftocratical party C!lbri. at Rome. The populace, led by some of the Tri-
bunes, were ever ready to insult the authority of the Senate; and the vices of particular men gave frequent advantages against the whole order of nobles. Corruption and dangerous fation pre- vailed at elecions, and the preferments of State were generally coveted, as fleps to the government .of provinces, where fortunes were amarfed by every species of abuse, oppression, and violence. Envy and indignation together concurred in rouiing the' L-. Corne- People againll these abuses. Cornelius, one of the EI- de ara- bitu. Tribunes, proposed a revere law against bribery,
by which persons convic'ted of this crime fllould be disqualified for any office whatever in the corn.
monwealth.
mncnwealth.. The Senate wished to soften the ri- H A P. gour of this law, by limiting the penalty to a pe- xI. cuniary fine; and the Consul, Calpurnius Pifo, moved for an edit to this purpose, in order to an- ticipate and to preclude the more violent law of Cornelius. But the Tribune prevailed, and ob- tained an ad imposing the feverer penalty. He likewise, by another decree of the People, attacked the discretionary jurifdidion of the Praetors ', obli- ged them to be more explicit in the edicts they published, and to observe them more exactly.
The crime of extortion in the provinces, how- ever, was the great disgrace of the Romans. To have found an effectual remedy for this evil, would have.done more honour'to the People than they had derived from all their conquefis. Severe laws were accordingly enacted, complaints were wil- lingly received, and prosecutions encouraged. Can- didates for popularity and public favour, generally began with endeavouring to bring some offender under this title to public justice; but the example of this State, after all, has left only this piece of inftrution to mankind; That just government over conquered provinces is fcarccly to be hoped for, and least of ail where republics are the conque- rors..
Manilius, one of the Tribunes of the People- in order to strengthen the inferior class of his confli- tuents, had obtained by surprise an acd A, by which the citizens of flaifhl extraction were to be pro-

c H A P. mifcuoufly inrolled in all the Tribes..' This ad,
,xv. having drawn upon him the,relfentment:of the Se-
nate, compelled him to seek for fecurity:under the protection of Gabinius aid Pompey. With this Lex Mani- view it was that he moved his famous ad, in which
Cicero concurred, to vest Pompey with the com- mand in Asia. This motion had procured him a powerful support, and on some occasions, raised the general voice of the People in his fayour. In- fomuch that soon after this tranfadtion,- being pro- fecuted for tome offence at the tribunal of Cicero, who was then Praxtor, and being refused the usual delays, the Praetor was obliged to explain this ftep in a speech to the People; in which he told them, that he adtually meant to favour Manilius, and that, his own term in office being about to expire, he could not serve him more effecually, than by hastening his trial, and by not leaving him in the power of a successor, who might not be equally disposed to acquit him. Such were the loose and popular notions of justice then prevailing, and the sacrifices made to party at Rome '.
At the eledtion of Consuls for the following year, there occurred an opportunity to apply the law against bribery. Of four candidates, Publius Autronius Petus, Publius Cornelius Sylla, L. Au- relius Cotta, and L. Manlius Torquatus, the ma- jority had declared for the former two; but there being convicted of bribery, were set aside, and their competitors declared duly elected.

In his rage for this disappointment, he was ripe for aly project of horror; and, being readily joined by Autronius and Pifo, the late disappointed candidates, formed a con- fpiracy to assassinate their rivals', to nlmalhcre the Senate, to seize the ensigns of power, and, with thc aid of their fadtion, to lay hold of the govern- ment :. Marcus Craflis and Caius Cefar, are men-. tioned by Suetonius as accefory to this plot. Craf- ifs was to have been named Dictator, and Cefari his general of the horse 3.

c i A P. ried on by the others to its full detection, ill the .. .. manner which remains to be told. The times in-
deed were pregnant with the feeds of extreme evil; many of those who, from their outset and profpeds, were deflined to run the political course, overwhelmed with the effets of prodigality and immnoderate expence in their suit to the People, incurred a ruin, which, if successful in their pre- tensions to office, was to be repaired by odious ex- pedients abroad, or, if disappointed, led them to projects of desperation and rage at home '.
The State appears to have apprehended an in- crease of tlhee evils from the number of foreigners, who, from every quarter, crowded to Rome as to the general resort of persons who wilfhed to indulge their own extravagance, or to prey upon, that of Texl' iapi. others. Under this apprehension, an edit was ob- de Pcrigr.L
i3. tained, upon the motion of C. Papius, Tribune of
the People, to oblige all firangers to leave the city : but it is lilkely, th-at the State was in greater danger from natives than foreigners. Cataline, having pre- vailed upon Ciodius, by the consideration of a fum of money, to drop the prosecution which had been commenced against him, was left to offer himself a candidate for the Consulate of the following year2.
The office of Censor had been revived in the perlons of Catulus and Craflus; but these officers found that its authority, so powerful in former times, was now greatly reduced. They scarcely ventured to give it a trial within the city; and, havin.' differed about the enrolment of citizens re-

tiding beyond the Po, and about fume other par- c 1 A P. ticulars, they resigned their power . Censors X'I.. were again named in the following year, but with no greater effect; some of the Tribunes, fearing to be themselves degraded from the Senate, put a negative on the usual funcdion of these officers in revising the rolls .
In the next Consulate, that of Lucius Julius Cr- u. c. 68,. far, and C. Marcius Figulus, Caius Cacfar, accu- c. '^lr. i- fed by Suetonius, as above, of hidden designs, but g'U. of whom we are from this time scarcely ever to lose fight, being now thirty-five years of age, entered on his career of popularity and ambition. It is remarked, that in his present Edilefihip, to- gether with Marcus Bibulus, not satisfied with the joint exhibition of public shews which were given to the People, at a common expence with his col- league, he gave separate entertainments on his own account. And destined, it Ihould seem, to be a thorn in the fide of those who were folicirous of public order, the gladiators he had aTenmblId on this occasion gave an alarm to the magiilracy, and he was ordered not to exceed a certain number. In his present office, or in that of 'Prctor, to which he was afterwards in course advanced, it is obfer- ved, that he took fiome iteps that were likely to revive the animosity of the late parties of Marius and Sylla; and, notwithitanding the a&t of indem- nity which had pafied, railed prosecutions, on a ch.arge of afatfination, againfl all those who had put any citizen to death in execution of Svlla's

c ii x r. proscription '. From this time Suetonius observes, .--,- . that Cicero, though it may be thought premature,
dated the beginning of his projet to subvert the republic, and to make himfelfmafter of.the State2.
What has most distinguished the present Con- fulate of Lucius Caesar, and Marcius Figulus, how- ever, is the competition of candidates for the fuc- ceflion to that office on the following year, and the consequences of the eletion which followed. The candidates were M. Tullius Cicero, C. Antonius, son of the late celebrated orator, L. Sergius Cata- lina, P. Sulpitius Galba, and L. Cassius Longinus, Quintus Cornificius, and Licinius Sacerdos.
Cicero was the first of his family who had ever resided, or enjoyed any honours, at Rome. He was a native of Arpinum, a country-town of Italy, and was confidered as an obscure person by those who were descended of antient families, but had great consideration on account of his eloquence and the consequences of it, to all such as had any interests at stake before the tribunals of juflice. Being solicited by Cataline to undertake his de. fence on a trial for malversation in Sicily, he did not at once rejet the request, nor always deny his aid to the factious Tribunes in support of their measures. He was undoubtedly, like other ambi- tious men at Rome, disposed to court every party, or to gain individuals 3; and had of late, in par-
ticular, I Su'ton, in Vit. C. J. Cefni is. ' . Ibid. c. ix. Suetonius ftlupofcs, that Cicero alluded to the confpiiacv o Auntroni::s and Sylla, in whlich Cra!it., as v.wll as C;rlcr, was :i!d to Tb eng . i i d.

ticular, considerably strengthened his interefl with c 1 A P. the People, by having ifupported the pretenlions of XvI. .their favourite Pompey, in having joined the po- pular Tribunes, in what they proposed in behalf of this aspiring citizen. He was, notwithftand- ing, probably by his aversion to appear for so bad a client as Cataline, saved from the reproach of having espoused his cause; and by his known in- clination in general to fuipport the authority of the Senate, he dilpofed the ariftocratical party to for- give the occasional part which he took with the Tribunes in particular questions, not immediately supposed to assec their ascendant in the State.
In the course of this competition fbr the Con- fulihip, Antonius and Cataline joined interefil to- gether, and spared no kind or degre.e of corrup- tion. Cicero complained of their practices in the Senate, and moved to revive the law of Calburni- us against bribery, with an additional penals-y of ten years banifhmentl. Cataline confidered this measure as levelled against himself; and incited by this provocation, as well as by the animosity of a rival, was then supposed to have formed a de- sign against Cicero's life, and to have expressed himself to this purpose, in terms that gave a gene- ral alarm to the electors, and determined gre: t numbers against himself. Hle had drawn to his in- terests many perfbns of infamous character and desperate fortune, many youths of good family, whom lie debauched or encouraged in their profli- gacy. His language, at their meetings, was all in-

c H A-'. dignation at the unequal and supposed unjufi di- XVII. .-^-_. ftribution of fortune and power. "Riches, au-
" thority and honour," he said, " are engrossed " by a few, while others of more merit are kept "in poverty and obscurity, or oppressed with "debts." He profelfed his intention, when in of- fice, to remove these grievances, to cancel the debts of his friends, to enrich them by plentiful divi- lions of land, and to place them in the flations of honour to which they were entitled.
Thcfe declarations, being made to numerous companies assembled together, could not be con- cealed. Curius, one of the fiacion, boafled to lFulvia, a woman of rank, with whom he had a criminal intrigue, that a revolution miuft soon take place, and specified the particular hopes and designs of their party. This woman men- tioned the fubjedq to her own confidents, but con. cealed the author of her information. Ln the mean time, Catalile was confidered as a person of the molt dangerous deligns, and was opposed in hi- election by all who had any regard to public or- der, or to the safety of the commonwealth. Ci- cero, at the fame time, being fiupported by the Se- nate, was elecccd, together with Caius Antoniuts The latter indeed flood candidate upon the fame interefl with Cataline, and wvas preferred to him only by a finall majority. r-. c. j y. By this event the designs of Cataline were sup-. C:ce. u posed to be fruflrated; but the Consuls were not :s.t'1h likely to enter on a quiet adminifIration. The Tri-
bunitia power', f-rom the time of its reflorationl
1V' .,
was gradually recovering its force, and extending c A:P. its operations. Every person that could give any , public disturbance, that could annoy the Senate, or mortify any of its leading members; every one that had views of ambition adverse to the laws, or who wished to take part in seenes of confusion and tumult; every person opprefled with debt, who withed to defraud his creditors; every.perfon who, by his profligacy or crimes, was at variance with the tribunals of justice, was comprehended under the general denomination of the popular party. The Roman People had once been divided into Pa- trician and.Plebeian, next into Noblemen and Com- moners; but now individuals took their fide with little regard to former diffincions againit or for the prcfervation of public order. In the assembly of the Centuries, as well as in that of the Tribes, the dif- orderly and the profligate began to prevail; and as it was impoflible that the colletive body of the People could meet in any fingie assembly, the co- mitia, for the most part, was but another name for such riotous tumults, as were made up of the per- sons who haunted the fireets of Rome. The minds of fober men were full of fear.and diftrufi, alarmed with formifes of plots, and various com- binations of desperate persons, who united their influence, not to carry elections or obtain pre- ferments, but to overturn the government, or to fiare in its spoils'.
One of the Tribunes of the prelcnt year, Scrvi- .ex Se.-. li.us Rullus, soon after his admillion into office, un- :i A.
X 4 .er I Cicero de Lcgr Ag.rara,
c H A P. der pretence of providing settlements for many of '~^. the citizens, promulgated the heads of an Agra-
rian Law, which lie carried to the Senate and the People. The subjed of former grants was now in a great mealfre cxhauftcd, and all Italy was inha- bited by the citizens of Rome. This Tribune proposed a new cxpecdient to provide for the indi- gent, not by conqueil, but by purchase. It was proposed, that all eilates, territories, or poiT-efions (o any forti which belonged to the republic, fhiould be solid that all acquisitions of territory recently made, and the spoils taken from any enemy, fiould be difpofec of in the fame manner, that the mo- ney arising from fitch sales fliould be employed in. purchasing arablc and cultivable lands, to be as- iigned in lots to the nccefiitous citizens; and that, to carry this law into execution, ten commifiioners ilhould be named in the fame manner in which the Pontiffs were named, not by the whole People, but by fcventeen of the Tribes felcrced by lot: that these commitlioners should be judges, without ap- peal, of what was or was not public property; of what was to be fold, of swhat was to be bought, and at what price; that they were to receive and to judge of the accounts of every Consul, or other officer, except Pompey, commanding in any pro- vince, whcre any capture had been made, or new territory acquired and in fliort, that they should, during five years, which was the intended term as their conmminion, be the sole masters of all pro-

XVII. vate. VI-.
On the day that the new Consuls entered oi their office, when they returned in proceflion from the Capitol, and gave the first meeting to the Se- nate, Rullus had the presumption to propose this law, and to move the Conscript Fathers, that they would be pleased to give it the sanction of their approbation and authority in being carried to the People. Upon this occasion, Cicero made his firlt speech in the charater of Consul. The former part of it is loft; the remainder may be reckoned among the highest specimens of his eloquence. In. this and the two speeches he delivered to the Peo- ple, on the fame subjea, he endeavoured to demon- firate, (if we may venture to imitate the profusion of his own expreflions) that, from the first clause of this law to the last, there was nothing thought of, nothing proposed, nothing done, but the erec- ing in ten perfbns, under the pretence of an Agra- rian Law, an abfoiute sovereignty over the trea- fury, the revenue, the provinces, the empire, the neighbouring kingdoms and 'states; and, in short, over all the world as fir as it was known to the Romans. He painted in flch lively colours the abuses which might be committed by Rullus, and by his associates, in judging what was private and what public property, in making tales, in making purchases, in planting the colonies; and to expo- fed the impudence of the cheat, by which it was propeofd to firprife the People into the granting
of
CH A P. of such powers, the abfuirdity and the ruinous ten- .---_ dency of the whole measure, that it was instantly
rejc(ted, and its author hissed from the aflembly, and treated as an object of ridicule and scorn.
The splendour of the Consul's eloquence, on this occasion, appeared with great difiincion, and the spirit of the times continued to furnish lim with opportunities to display it '. Roscius Ame- rinus, having been Tribune of the People a few years before, had, by the authority of his office, set apart some benches in the theatre for the Equef- trian order. This gave offence to the People, so that Roscius was commonly hissed when he appear- ed at any of the public assemblies. On some one of these occasions the Consul interposed; and, in a popular harangue, secured the attachment of the Knights to himself, and even reconciled the People to the diftindtion which had been made in favour of that body.
There happened under the fame Consulate a business of greater difficulty, being a motion to re- store the sons of the proscribed to the privilege of being chosen into the ofices of State, of which they h:Ad becn deprived by an ordinance of Sylla. Their fate was undoubtedly calamitous and severe. Many of them who had been too young to -have incurred the guilt of their party, were now come of age, and found themselves tlript of their birth-
right, i It is probable that Cicero did not write in order to speak, but w\rote as- ter he had spoken, for the use of his friends. Epift. ad Atticunm, lib ii. C. i,
right, and fligmatized with this mark of diflho- c A P. nour. It was proposed, in their behalf, to take ., away this cruel exclusion. But Cicero, appre- hending that this proposal tended to arm and to strengthen persons, who, from long use, had con- traated an habitual difaffedion to the eflablifined government at Rome, powerfully opposed the mo- tion, and succeeded in having it rejeced '.
Though the orations on the two filbjects last men- tioned have perished, great part of that which he spoke on the trial of C. Rabirius still remains. This man, of a great age, a refpedable Senator, after an interval of six-and-thirty years, was brought to trial as an accomplice in the death of Apuleius Saturninus, the factious Tribune, who, as has been related, having seized the Capitol, was, by the Con- fuls Marius and Valerius Flaccus, adcing under the authority of the Senate, and attended by all the most refpedable citizens in arms, forced from his firong-hold, and put to death as a public enemy.
Titus Atius Labienus, one of the Tribunes, was the declared prosecutor of C. Rabirius; but his- torians agree, that this Tribune aded at the infti- gation, and under the diredion, of C. Crefar. The intention of the popular party was, by making an example of this rei'ecdable person in so strong a cafe, where the authority of the Senate, and the commands of the most popular Consul, where even the prescription of so old a date fimnold have re- pelled every danger, cfTedunlly, for the future,' to
deter x Plin. lib. vii. c. 3.
C HA p. deter every person from ading in support of the
:vI. Senate, or fiom lending any force or opposition to
the designs of factious Tribunes, however turbu- lent or dangerous.
The Senate, and all the friends of established authority, were greatly alarmed, and united in de- fence of Rabirius. The popular party, as already described, the ambitious, the profligate, the bank- rupt, who were carneft to weaken the hands of government, and in haste to bring on scenes of confusion and trouble, took the opposite fide.
The prosecutor laid his charge for treason of the moll heinous nature, which must have led the convided, though a freeman, to die on the cross, the ordinary manner of executing the sentence of death on slaves. " The executioner stalks in the <' forum," said Cicero, " and the cross is erected " for a Roman citizen in the field of Mars." The accusation was first broughrt before the Praetor, who poffeired the ordinary jurifdidion in such cafes. And this magistrate empannelled two jud- ges, who w ere to determine in this mighty cause. These were Caius Julius and Lucius Caesar. At this court the defendant was condemned; and with appearances of animosity on the part of Caius Cafar, that greatly increased the public alarm. This rising citizen had always courted the popu- lace, and was strongly supported by them. That he Ihould aim at honours and power, it was said, is common; but that he wished to provide impu- nity for the lifturbers of the commonwealth, was
dreadful.
dreadful. The crime of Rabirius, even if he could c H A P. be convieted of it, had been committed the year . xl before Caesar was born. In the person of the ac- cufed every circumflance, even on the ftppofition of a true charge, pleaded for compaflion, and even for refpea : the fa(t, at the fame time, was denied, and a positive evidence was brought, that another had received a reward for killing Saturninus: but the policy of the facrion required this victim; and the sentence must have been executed, if the coni- demned had not fled, by appeal, to the judgment of the People, where indeed his caufc might be reckoned more desperate than it had been before a felet court. The parties attended this trial with great ardour. Hortenfius conducted the ap- peal and defence. Cicero pleaded in behalf of justice and government; painted the age, the in- firmities, the forlorn itate of the defendant, who had survived his relations and his friends. He pointed out the danger to government and to or- der from this precedent, in terms that must have melted every heart, not callous from ambition, ifac- tion, or profligacy of manners : but in vain. Even in the assembly of the Centuries, the m:jority was hastening to affirm the fentencc, when Q: Caeci!ius Metellus Celer, then Prnetor, and one of the Au- gurs, haflened to the Janiculum, and tore down the ensign which was planted there as a i!,;n of peace.

c }I A P. itrain. This form took its rife, as has been for-
m erly mentioned 1, in the firit ages of Rome, when the enemy inhabiting villages in the neighbour- hood were supposed at the gates, and the people convened in the field on one lide of the city might be assailed on the other. When the Centuries were formed, therefore, in the field of Mars, a guard was always posted on the Janiculum, and an ensign displayed. If any enemy appeared, the ensign was taken down, the aflembly dismissed, and the People took to their arms. This ceremo- ny, like many other cufloms both of superstition and law, remained after the occasion had ceased; and it was held illegal or impious in the People to proceed in any affair without the ensign in view. By this means the trial of Rabirius was put off, and the prosecutors, despairing of being able to work up the People again into an equal degree of violence, dropt the prosecution. The cause still remained undecided, and the power of the Senate, to defend its own authority, continued in a slate of flu^pence.
The Tribune Labienus laid aside thoughts of renewing this invidious prosecution, in order to pursue the object of some other more popular ads; one in particular, to repeal the almost only remain- ing ordinance of Sylla; that which conferred on the College of Priefls the power of filling up va- cancies in their own order. The right of election was again taken from the college, and, according
to 1 sCLd vol. i. c. 1.
tothe law of Domitius, given to seventeen of the C.H A '. Tribes, who were to be drawn by lot. This change X_ . was intended to open the way of Caius Caesar into that office; and he was accordingly promoted to it in the following year.
Others of the Tribunes likewise endeavoured to distinguish themselves by ads of turbulence and sedition. Metellus Nepos endeavoured to re- peal that clause of the ad against bribery and cor- ruption, which declared the party conviced to be disqualified for any of the offices of State. This Tribune, though sufficiently disposed to diibrderly courses, had many connections among the molt refpedtable citizens, and was persuaded, in this instance, to drop his design.
But of all the cabals into which the popular fation was distributed, none was more desperate, nor supposed more dangerous, than that of Cata- line, the late disappointed candidate for the Con- fulfhip. His rival Cicero had intimation, before the elections, of a design formed by this desperate party against his own person, and still continued to observe their motions. For this purpose he en- tered into a correspondence with a woman of the name of Fulvia, already mentioned, and who had given the first hints of a dangerous conspiracy ; by means of this woman, he procured the confi- dence of Curius, who gave him minute informa- tion of all the proceedings of the party.
In public, Ctal aine a protflcd limrfelf a candidate for the cetI'e of Confti!. il competition
with
c H . '. with Servius Sulpicius, P. Murana, and J. Silanus, XVIL. - -_ He boasted of support from Antonius; but Cicero,
to divert his colleague from this dangerous con- nesion, made him every concession. Having, in casting lots for the provinces of Gaul and Mace- donia, drawn the latter, which was thought to be: preferable, he yielded it up to Antonius; and by this, and every other means in his power, perfua- ded him to reft on the secure pofleflion of dignities and honours, lawfully obtained, in preference to expeAations formed on the projets of a few def- perate men.
In secret, Cataline encouraged his adherents by pretending to have many resources, and to be sup- ported by numbers who were ready to take arms at his command. In a formal meeting of his par- tv in Otober, a few days before the Consular elections, he opened the whole of his design; and in the speech which he made on that occasion, is said to have used expressions to the following pur- port: " The distressed can rely for relief on those
only who have a common cause with them-
! selves. Whoever is at ease in his own fortune, '' will not regard the suffering of others. If yotu ·' would know how I fiand affected to the parties ·( which now divide the republic, rich creditors, "and needy debtors, please to confider, what every ( one knows, that I have no safety but in the de-
f triuction of the one, and in the relief of the " otler: that my intercft is the fame with your own,
" and
' and that I have courage to attempt what may be c H A P. t' necessary for our common relief and-fecurity." L-
From the Itrain of this passage, the description *of a party'to whom it was with propriety addref- fed, may be easily collected. Cicero, who had frequently taxed Cataline with dangerous designs, .now determined' to lay the whole of his intelli- gence before the public; and for this purpose de- ferred the Consular elections, which were to have been held on the eighteenth of Otober, to a fu- ture day, and assembled the Senate. Cataline hav- ing, with the other members, attended, and hear- ing the charge, did not pretend to deny or to pal- liate his words. " There are," he said, "i in this " republic, two parties; one weak both in its
members and head; the other strong in its ' members, but wanting a head: while I have "the honour of being ftupported by this party, it " shall have a head." Upon these words, a gene- ral cry of indignation arote in the Senate; but no resolution was taken. Many, who were there present as members, were pleased to fee the Senate itself insulted; and Cataline, as if in condition to brave all his enemies, was, in all his expressions, .equally unguarded in the fireets and in the Se- nate. To Cato, who, in the public Forum, some days before this meeting, had threatened to have him impeached: " Do," he said; " but if you
light a flame in my fortunes, I will extinguifit ( it under the ruins of the commonwealth '."

c HA. A prosecution was actually raised against him xvn. in the name of Lucius Paulus, a young man of
diftinaion, for carrying arms against the public peace. On this occasion, however, he thought proper to soften his tone, and offered to submit to voluntary confinement, until his innocefnce filould be made to appear. " Np one," he said, "( who
knows my rank, my pretensions, and the interest I " have in the preservation of the commonwealth, " will believe, that its deftrution is to be apprehen- " ded from me, and that its safety is to come from " a native of Arpinum ." He offered to commit himself to the custody of Cicero, of Metellus, or of any other magistrate, till this injurious asper- sion were removed. To this offer the Consul re- plied, That he who did not think himself safe within the fame ramparts with Cataline, would not receive him into his house2.
By one effec of the unparalleled licence enjoy- ed by citizens of Rome, persons accused of the noft heinous crimes were at large, during the de- pendence of their trial, and might either proceed in the execution of their designs, or withdraw from justice. Such was the effet of the laws of Valerius and Porcius, which secured against violence, or the power of the magistrate, the person of every citizen, however accused, until he were finally condemned by the People. In support of this privilege, which was salutary, when the abuse of power in the ma-
giftrate X The town of which Cicero vwas native. , Ccro I n C.ta'.na.m, i. c. A,
giftrate was more to be dreaded than the licence c H A P. of crimes in the subjed, the Romans periifted even _ . after the depravity of manners was become too strong for the laws, and when exemption from every just restraint was fatally mistaken for liberty. The State had now been thrown, on many occa- sions, into the most violent convulsions, because there was not any regular method of reflling dif- orders, or of suppressing them on their firtl appear- ance.
Cataline, soon after the elections, at which, by the preference given to his competitors Murena and Silanus, he received a fresh disappointment in his hopes of the Consulship, sent Mallius, or Man- lius, an experienced soldier, who had served with himself under Sylla, to prepare for an insurrection in the diftrid of Etruria. This officer, in the end of October, under pretence of giving refuge to debtors from the opprefiion of their creditors, had actually afembled a considerable body of men '. Suspicions at the fame time arose againit Publius Sylla, who was making a large purchase of gla- diators at Capua, and infurredions were appre- hended on the fide of Campania and Apulia. In this slate of affairs, continual informations being brought of Cataline's designs, the Senate gave in charge to the Consuls to watch over the safety of the State; and these officers accordingly put chosen bodies of men under arms, and secured all the posts of consequence in the city. Metellus, the conqueror of Crete, who still remained without
Y2 the x Cicero in Catallnam, . c. 3.
c 1 A P. the walls in hopes of a triumph, was appointed to i __, command on the fide of Apulia. The Prxtor Me-
tellus Celer was sent into the Cisalpine Gaul, in order to secure the peace of that province'; and the Consul Antonius was destined to suppress the infurreftion of Mallius at Fasfulae .
Cataline mean while remained in the city, and had frequent consultations for the arrangement and the execution of his plot. At a meeting of the party, held in the beginning of November, in the house of M. Porcius Lecca3, a general massacre of the principal Senators was projected. The con- fpirators severally chose their flations, and under- took their several parts. Two in particular, who were familiar in Cicero's house, undertook in the morning, under pretence of a visit, to surprise and assassinate the Consul. But he being the fame night apprised of his danger by Fulvia, gave the proper orders, and the intended aflaffins, upon their appearance at his door, were refused admit- tance. He immediately after assembled the Senate in the temple of Jupiter. Cataline presented him- self with his usual presumption; and Cicero; as appears from an oration which he then delivered, instead of laying the. matter in form before the Senate, accofled Cataline in a vehement invective, *rging him to be gone from the city, where all his itceps were minutely observed, where his meaning .vas understood, and precautions taken against all
his Cicero in Cat. i. c. iz. 2 Now' Florcnce, - C: 'rrn uoro b S-la;, c. iO.
his designs. " I told you," said the Consul, " that c n A P. "your emiflary Mallius would be in arms by the xVI "first of November; that you intended a mafiacre "of the Senators about the fame time. I now re- "peat the memorable words you made use of ' when you were told, that many of the Senators "had withdrawn from the city. You ihould be " satisfied, you said, with the blood of those who "remained. Were you not surrounded, hemmed " in, and beset on every fide by the guards posted ' to watch you? Did your intention to furprifc "Prsnefte, on the night of the first of November, "escape me? Did you not find precautions taken " that implied a knowledge of your design ? There "is nothing, in flort, that you do, that you pre- "pare, that you meditate, which is not heard, " which is not seen, which is not felt by me in " every circumstance. What of last night? Were " you not at the house of Porcius Lecca? Deny "it! I have evidence. There are here present
persons who were of your company. But where "are we? What manner of government or re- "public is this ? The enemies and destroyers of "the commonwealth make a part in its highest "councils! We know them, and yet they are iss- "sered to live ! But, be gone. The time of en- "during you is pall. The world is convinced of "your guilt. Stay only till there is not a lingle " person that can pretend to doubt of it; till your " own partizans must be silent, and till the cla-
mour, which they would willingly raise againfl
Y , " every
c i AP. . " every necefihry at of government, be fuppref- XVII. " fed."
This being the general tendency of the Consul's speech, fraught with such alarming matter, and Urged with so much confidence, the audience was seized with terror, and numbers, who happened to be on the fame bench with Cataline, withdrew from his fide. He himself arose, and attempted to vindicate his character, but was silenced with a general cry of indignation; upon which he left the Senate; and, after concerting farther measures with those of his party, not thinking that a longer stay in the city could be of any use to his affairs, he withdrew in the night, leaving letters behind him to some of the Senators, in which he com- plained, that, by a combination of his enemies, he was driven into exile; and that, rather than be the occasion of any disturbance in the commonwealth, he was willing to retire. While these letters were handed about in the city, he took his way, preced- ed by the uflers and ensigns of a Roman Procon- ful, straight for the camp of Mallius, and entered into a Rate of open war. The features of this man's portrait are possibly exaggerated by the vehement pencils and lively colourings of Cicero and of Sallust. He is represented as able to endure hardships of any kind, and as fearless in any dan- ger; as, from his youth, fond of discord, afaflina- tions, and bloodshed; as fained with the blood of his own brother, whom he murdered to have his estate, and with the blood of his own child,
whom
whom he murdered, to remove the objection made c H A P. to him by a woman who refused to marry him with xv_. the profpeEt of being a step-mother. He is repre- sented as rapacious, prodigal, gloomy, impetuous, unquiet, dissembling, and perfidious; a description, of which the horrors are probably amplified: but for which it cannot be doubted there was much foundation, as he far exceeded in profligacy and desperation all those who, either in this or the for- mer age, were, by their ambition or their vices, hastening the ruin of the commonwealth.
Cicero always professed to have particular in- formation of the progress of Cataline. This, ac- cording to Sallust, he owed to Fulvia, by whose means he obtained a correspondence with Curius; but he himself, in none of his orations, gives any intimation of the manner in which he obtained his intelligence. It is probable that Curius desired to be concealed, that he might not be expoied to the rage of the conspirators as an informer and a traitor. On this account the Consul, although he was minutely apprised of particulars, was obliged to adopt the plan he had hitherto followed, to urge the conspirators themselves into open hostilities, and into a full declaration of their purpose. He had succeeded with refpea to Cataline; but his accomplices were yet very numerous in the city, and were taking their measures to co-operate with those who were in arms abroad.
In this state of affairs Fabius Sanga, a Roman citizen of distinCtion, came to the Consul, and in-
Y 4 formed
c H A P. formed him, that the ambafadors of the Allobro- ..- ~ ges, a people then inhabiting what is now called
the territory of Geneva, and part of Savoy, whose patron he was, had made him privy to a very mo- mentous affair; that, upon being disappointed in a suit, on which they had been employed to the Se- nate, they had been carried by P. Umbrenus to'Pub- ius Cornelius Lentulus the Pretor, who condoled with them on the fubje& of the wrong they had re- ceived, allured them of redress if they would merit the favour of those who were soon to' have the as- cendant at Rome-; and proposed, that they should immediately, upon their return to their own coun- try, prevail on their nation to be prepared with an army, to co-operate with their friends in Italy. Ci- cero immediately laid hold of this intelligence, as afiording means tobring the plot to light, in a proper manner, and with sufficient evidence, to convict the conspirators. Hie desired Sanga to encourage this correspondence; to advise the ambassadors to re- quire proper credentials to be shown to their coun- trymen; to procure a lift of the Roman citizens who, in cafe they fiould rife in rebellion against the Romans, were to become bound to protet them; and when they fiould be thus provided, and about to depart, lie infIrudted Sanga to bring him inti- mll:t-ion of tlheir motions, that they might be fecu- red, with their writings, and other evidence of the facts to be ascertained. Sanga, having inftruded the amblalfadors accordingly, gave notice of their
- ~ - .nmotion's
motions to the Consul. In the evening before they c H A P. were to depart, Cicero ordered the Praetors, L. , Flaccus and C. Pontinus, to march by different ways, and in small parties, after it was dark, to place a sus- ficient armed force to intercept the ambafiadors of the Allobroges. The parties were stationed on different fides of the river, at the bridge called Milvius, without knowing of each other, and with- out having any suspicion of the purpose for which they were posted, farther than arose from their having been told, that they were to seize any per- ibn who fliould attempt to pass in either direcion. About three o'clock in the morning the ambaffa- dors from the Roman fide entered on the bridge with a numerous retinue; and being challenged, and commanded to stop by the party that was pla- ced to intercept them, they endeavoured to force their way; and some blood was fled. But on the appearance of the Prators, with their ensigns of office, the travellers ceased to resist. Their dif- patches were secured. Volturcius, a Roman citi- zen, who was found in their company, was taken and searched. Letters were found upon him, in different hands, and under different feals, address- ed to Cataline. These, together with the pri- ibners, were immediately carried back to the city.
The Consul being apprised of the success which attended this part of his design, sent, before any alarm could be tt.ken by the party, meflages to Gabinius, Statilius, Cethegus, and Lentulus, dell- ring to fee them at his own house. The three for-
ellwr
c H A P. mer came with the messenger; but Lentulus was x..I., newly gone to bed, and, by his delay, gave some
cause to fufped that he was aware of his danger. He too, however, came before it was day; and the house of Cicero was presently crowded, not only with numbers of the Equestrian order that were in arms for the defence of his person, but likewise with many Senators whom he desired to be present. The ambassadors of the Allobroges, now prisoners, were likewise conducted thither, and the letters found in their possession, were produced unopen- ed. Cicero declared his intention to assemble the Senate without delay, in order to lay the whole matter before them. Many of the company were of opinion, that the letters should be first opened, in order to fee, whether they contained any matter of so much moment, as to require assembling the Senate, at a time when so, great an alarm was like- ly to be taken. Cicero, however, having no doubt of the contents of the letters, and of the import- ance of the matter, over-ruled those scruples, and the Senate was accordingly called. Mean time the Allobroges dropt some expreflions which im- plied, that some arms were concealed in the house of Cethegus. This occasioned a search being then made, and a considerable quantity of daggers and swords were accordingly found.
At the meeting of the Senate, Volturcius was first examined; he denied his knowledge of any treasonable designs, but appeared disconcerted; and, upon being reminded of the reward that had
been
been offered for the discovery of any plot against c A P. the State, and of the danger to which he himself x-_ would be exposed in prevaricating, he confefled, that the letters seized in his custody were sent by the Praetor Lentulus and others: that he had be- fides a verbal message to Cataline, informing him, that the plan was now ready for execution; that the station of every person was assigned; that some were appointed to set fire to the city in different places, and some to massacre their enemies in the midst of the confusion that was likely to be occa- sioned by the fire; and desiring that Cataline, in order to support his friends, and to profit by the diversion they were to make in his favour within the walls, should isue a proclamation to arm the slaves, and that he himself should march directly to Rome.
The deputies of the Allobroges being next in- troduced, acknowledged, that they had been char- ged by Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, and Cassius, with assurances of support to the council of their nation, confirmed by oath, accompanied with di reftions to march, without delay, a body of horse into Italy, where they ihould be joined by a nu- merous infantry, and receive proper infirusions in what manner they should farther proceed: that, to encourage them, Lentulus quoted a prophecy, found in the collecion of the Sibyls, by which he himself was pointed out as the third of the Cor- nelii' destined to arrive at the sovereignty of Rome:

The supposed conspirators were next called in their turns; and the letters, with the feals unbro- ken, were exhibited before them.

He preserved his counte- nance undisturbed, till his own letter was produ- ced, and then fell into great confusion, as the feal was immediately known to be his.
Lentulus next, with great confidence, denied the charge; affected not to know either Voltur- cius or the ambassadors; asked them upon what occasion they ever could pretend to have been ad- mitted into his house? He, however, supposing that nothing in the contents of the letter that was now produced could convict him, acknowledged the feal. It was the head of his grandfather. But the letter being opened, was found to be unligned, and in the following general terms " The bear- "er will inform you who I am. Fear nothing.

" This," he said, " is no unprecedented mea, " sure. My grandfather, Fulvius Flaccus, taken in " open rebellion as this man is, was slain by
order of the Consul Gabinius. His son was ta- "ken into custody and put to death in prison." In the mean time Lentulus was ordered to diveit himself of the office of Prastor, and, together with his accomplices, was committed to close imprison- ment. This Cornelius Lentulus was distinguished by the addition of Sura to his name. He had been Consul about eight years before, and was after- wards, for his debaucheries, struck off the rolls of the Senate.

treasonable
C H A r. treasonable design ; to the Prators, for the faithful xvm execution of the Consul's orders; and to Anto-
nius, his colleague, for having detached himself from men with whom he was known to have been formerly conneced. A public thanksgiving to the gods was likewise decreed in honour of the Con- ful, and in consideration of this deliverance of the city from fire, of the People from massacre, and of Italy from devaflation and war.
An assembly of the People being called, Cicero gave this account of the proceedings of the Se- nate, in a speech which is still extant ', and early on the following day assembled that body again, to deliberate on the farther resolutions to be taken with refped to the prisoners. An agent had been busy in the night to raise some disturbance in fa- vour of Lentulus; but the design of setting fire to the city gave so great an alarm, that not only such as were pofeffed of considerable property, but every inhabitant, whatever might be his effects, trembled for his own person, and for the safety of his house. The avenues to the Senate, the Capitol, the Forum, all the Temples in the neighbourhood, by break of day, were crowded with armed men. The Consul had summoned the Equestrian order in arms to support the government, and citizens of every rank came forth to have a part in what might be required for the safety of their families.
When the Senate was assembled, the members differed in their judgment. Junius Silanus, one of the Confuls-eleCt, being called up first in order, de-
clared r In Cat. 3.
dared himself for a sentence of death. Tiberius c H A P. Nero differed from him, and proposed perpetual xvn. imprisonment. The majority, however, joined Si- lanus, until Caius Cxefar spoke. This able advo- cate declared against the opinion of Silanus, not as too revere, but as contrary to law; and infified on the danger of a precedent which might set the life of every citizen at the mercy of a vote in the Senate. Death, he said, was the common deftina- tion of all men; what no one could avoid, and what the wife frequently coveted. It was not, therefore, to be used as a punishment; and he was disposed, in this cafe, not to mitigate, but to increase, the feve- rity of the sentence. He proposed, therefore, that the eflates of the prisoners fliould be confiscated; that their persons Ihould be committed for life to the keeping of the most secure and best affected corporations in Italy; and that it fliould be de- clared treason for any one hereafter to move the Senate or the People for any mitigation of their punishment.
Cafar might be confidered as appearing on the fide of the popular faction, and as laying the ground upon which the proceedings of the Senate, and the conduc of any particular member, might be afterwards arraigned before the People. The terrors of the Porcian and Sempronian laws, when likely to be urged by so powerful an advocate, alarmed the greater part of the Senate. Silanus himself retracted his opinion. In this fludation the Consul submitting the quefion to the judge-
ment
c H A P. ment of the Senate, for his own part declared his ·x VL willingness to execute any decree they should form.
He treated Caesar with great refpeat, and with some art laid hold of the severe terms in which this po- pular citizen had spoken of the conspiracy, as a pledge of his future condu6t, in cafe the proceedings of government, with respect to the matter now be- fore them, ihould hereafter be questioned or brought under review. " The Senate," he observed, " had "no cause to dread the imputation of cruelty. It "was mercy to prevent, in the most effectual man- "ner, a crime to be perpetrated in so much blood. ' If this crime were not prevented, they were to
fee that city, the resort of nations, and the light " and ornament of empire, perish at one blow.
They were to fee heaps of her citizens unbu- "ried, and lying in their blood: they were to fee ' the fury of Cethegus let loose in murder; to
fee Lentulus become a king, Cataline command- " ing an army, and every where to hear the cries " of mothers, to fee the flight of children, and the " rape of virgins.-If the father of a family," he continued, " should spare a slave who had shed "the blood of his children, who had murdered " his wife, and set fire to his dwelling, how flould " such a father be confidered-as cruel, or as void "of affecion ?
" He desired them not to regard what was given " out, of their not being in condition to attempt ·' any thing vigorous against there men. He him- " self, as first magistrate, had not neglected the
" neceflary
' necefiary precautions; and the general ardour c HAP. " with which all ranks of men concurred in the xv. ' defence of their families, their properties, and "the feat of empire, rendered every resolution
they could take secure of the utmost effect. The "forum is full, all the temples in its neighbour-
hood are full, all the fireets and avenues to this " place of assembly are full of citizens of every " denomination, armed for the defence of their " country. But he requested that the Senate " would issue their orders before the fun went "down, and seemed to apprehend dangerous con- " sequences, if these matters were left undeter- ' mined, and the city exposed to the accidents ' of the following night. For himself, he pro- " sessed to have taken his resolution. Although " he felt the occasion full of perolnal danger, he " would execute the orders of the conscript fa- "thers," he said ; but, if he fell in the attempt,
implored their protection for his wife and his "children I."
All this appears to have passed in debate before Cato spoke. This virtuous citizen, then about thirty-three years of age, had, in the former part of his life, taken a very different course from the youths of his own time, and, both by his temper and education, was averse to the libertine princi- ples which had crept into .the politics and the manners of the age. He spoke chiefly in answer to Caius Caxfar, who, he observed, seemed to mif-

c H A P. take the question. " We are not enquiring," he xL. said, " what is the proper punifliment of a crime
"already committed, but how we may defend the "republic from an imminent danger with which
it is threatened. It is proposed to fend the pri- f' loners to iafe keeping in the country. Why "' into the country ? Because perhaps the faction "of profligate citizens is more numerous in Rome, " and mty rescue them. Is Rome the only plaee ' to which profligate men may resort, or are pri- ' toners of State most secure where the force of -' government is least? This proposal is surely an " idle one, if the author of it professes to entertain " any fear of these men. But if, in this general ' alarm of all the city, he anrd such persons be not "afraid, so much the more cause have we to be ' on our guard. We are beset with enemies, " both within and without the walls. While Ca- ' taline with fire and fvord- is hastening to your ' gates, you hesitate, whether you will cut off or ' spare his associates, who are taken with the torch "in their hands and the dagger at your breast ! " You muff firike those who are now in your " power, if you mean to intimidate those who are * coming to support their designs. The remiss- ' nets or the vigour which you now flow, will * be felt in the camp of Cataline, and will be at- * tended with suitable effects. I am therefore of
opinion, that we order these men, agreeably to ' the nrapdice which our ancestors have followed
" in
" in all cafes of treason and of open war againlt c I A 1 "the commonwealth, to immediate death." . XV
Such is said to have been the speech of Cato, by which the Senate was determined in the very momentous resolution which was taken on the present occasion; and however little we may be inclined to confider fuich compositions in many parts of ancient history as records of fad, much credit is due to this representation, as it is given by a person who himself became a partizan of Cxe- far, and as the words which he ascribed to these speakers muff have come in the perusal of his work under the infpecion of many who were present to the delivery of them'. The execution of the prisoners was accordingly determined, and Cor- nclius Lentulus, in the beginning of the follow- ing night, was, by order of the Consul, committed to a vaulted dungeon under ground, and firangled. His accomplices had the fame fate; and the minds of men, though somewhat quieted of their fears, were nevertheless fiunned with the scene, and be- held with amazement a Patrician of the Cornelian family, of the first rank in the commonwealth, who himself had been Consul, suffering, without any formal trial, by the hands of the common es-. ecutioner ofjuftice .
Z 2 While i T'I'e mre credit is due to this account of Crefar's and of Cato's speech, tjiat the fpecch which is ascribed to Cicero by the fame hiftori:n, is a faithful extrad, or contains the piu;port of the oration which flill remains ::mo;lg his works.

c H1 A P. While there thirgs were in agitation at Rome, xVI. Cataline was endeavouring to augment his force
in the field. He found about two thousand men under Mallius. These he formed into two legions, and as his party increased he completed their num- bers. He refuted for tome time to enrol the fu- gitive slaves, of whom many took refuge in his camp; thinking it would discredit and weaken his cause to reft any part of it on this support. But the freemen that joined him being ill armed, he was obliged to keep in the neighbourhood of the mountains, and frequently to change his ground, to avoid an engagement with the Consul; and he endeavoured to gain time, in hopes that, the in- tended blow being struck at Rome, a general de- section of the opposite party would ensue. But when accounts came that his design had failed in the city, and that his principal aflbciates were no more, those who were inclined to his cause were discouraged, and numbers who had already joined him began to fall off, he determined to remove to a distance from his enemies; and for this purpose directed his march to a pass in the Apennines, by which he might escape into Gaul. This design the Praetor Metellus had foreseen, made a forced march to prevent the effet of it, and Cataline at last, finding himself beset on every quarter, deter- mined to hazard a battle. Of the armies that were in the field againit him, he chore to face that of Antonius; either because it lay on his route to Rome, and, if defeated or removed, might
open
open his way to the city, or because he hoped to c H A P. meet in the commander of it some remains of in- xv--. clination in his favour. In whatever degree these hopes were at first reasonably conceived, they ceased to have any foundation; as Antonius, be- ing taken ill, had left the army under the com- mand of Petreius. With this commander Cata- line engaged in battle, and, after many efforts of valour and of conduc, fell, with the greater part of his followers, and thus delivered the State from a desperate enemy, whose power was happily not equal to his designs, and who has owed much of his celebrity to the orator and the hiltorian, who have made him the subject of their eloquent com- position'. Sallust appears to have been so intent on raising and finishing particular parts of his work, that he negle&ed the general order of his narrative. I have, therefore, in most parts of the relation, preferred the authority of Cicero to his. This great man was undoubtedly best informed, and he refted so much of his reputation on this tranfaaion, that he loses no opportunity of return- ing to it, and in different parts of his writings, when collected, has furnished a pretty full narra- tion of circumfiances refpeding the origin and termination of this wild and profligate attempt to subvert the government of the republic.

conceived in so much guilt, or of characters so atro- cious as those under which the accomplices of Ca- taline are described by the eloquent orator and his- torian ', from whose writings the circumflances of the late conspiracy are collected. The scene, how- ever, in this republic was such as to have no pa. rallel, either in the pass or in' the subsequent his- tory of mankind. There was less government, and more to be governed, than has been exhibited in any other instance. The inhabitants of Italy, as citizens of Rome, were become mailers of the known world. They pretended to govern in a body, but it was impossible they ever could meet in a fair and adequate convention. They were re- presented, therefore, by partial meetings or occa- iional tumults in the capital and to take the sense of the People on many a subjed, was little better than to occaficn a riot. Individuals were veiled with powers ailioft discretionary in the pro-
vinces, . Cicero in Sa;!uR.
vinces, or continually aspired to such situations. c H A '. At home they were impatient of government, and .v''. in haste to govern. Ruined in their fortunes by private prodigality, or by the public expence in soliciting honouys; tempted to repair their ruins by opprefion and extortion where they were in- trusted with command, or by desperate attempts against the government of their country, if difap- pointed in their hopes of sharing its profits. Not only were many of the prevailing practices difor- derly, but the law itself was erroneous '; adopt- ed indeed at first by a virtuous people, because it secured the persons and the rights of individuals againit the possibility of injustice, but now anxi- oufly preserved by their posterity, because it. gave a licence to their crimes.
The provinces were to be retained by the forces of Italy; the Italians, them el ves by the ascendant of the capital; and in this capital all was confiu- lion and anarchy, except where the Senate, by its authority and the wildom of its councils, prevail- ed. It was no doubt expedient for the People to reltrain abuses of the ariftocratical power; but when they aifumed the government into their own hands, or when the sovereignty was exercised ini the name of the collective body, Labues were mul-

H A P. tiplied, and the confusion or anarchy which pre- xyv. vailed at Rome spread from one extremity of her
dominion to the ,other. The provinces were op- pressed, not upon a regular plan to aggrandize the State, but at the pleasure of individuals, to enrich a few of the most outrageous and profligate citi- zens. The People, under pretence of exerting their own powers, were perpetually violating the laws which had been made to restrain usurpations; and the public interetls and the order of the State were in perpetual struggle with the pretensions of demagogues, or of single and profligate men. In such a iituation there were many temptations to be wick- ed; and in such a situation likewise, minds that were turned to integrity and honour had a proportion- ate spring and scope to their exertions and pur- suits. The range of the human chara6ter was great and extensive, and men were not likely to trifle within narrow bounds; they were defined to be good or to be wicked in the highest mea- sure, and, by their struggles, to exhibit a scene in- teresting and inftrutive beyond any other in the history of mankind.
Among the causes that helped to carry the cha- raders of men in this age to such distant extremes, may be reckoned the philosophy of the Greeks, which was lately come into fashion, and which was much affected by the higher ranks of men in the State '. Literature, by the difficulty and ex-

pence of multiplying copies of books ', being con- c H A P.
XVIII. fined to persons having wealth and power, it was confidered as a diftindion of rank, and had its vogue not only as an useful, but as a fashionable accomplishment '. The lessons of the school were admitted as the elements of every liberal and at- ive profession, and they were quoted at the bar, in the field, in the Senate, and every where in the conduct of real affairs. Philosophy was confider- ed as: an ornament, as well as a real foundation of strength, ability and wisdom, in the practice of life. Men of the world, instead of being ashamed of their fedt, affeced to employ its language on every important occasion, and to be governed by its rules so much as to assume, in compliance with particular systems, diflindions of manners, and even of dress. They embraced their forms in philofo- phy, as the fedaries in modern times have embra- ced theirs in religion; and probably in the one cafe honoured their choice by the sincerity of their faith and the regularity of their pracice, much in the fame degree as they have done in the other.
In these latter times of the Roman republic the fed of Epicurus appears to have prevailed; and what. Fabricius, on hearing rehearsed the tenets of this philosophy, wished for the enemies of Rome, had now befallen her citizens . Men were
glutted i The grandees had their saves sometimes educated to serve as secretaries to themselves, or as preceptors to their children.

CHAP. glutted with national prosperity; they thought , XVi'that they were born to enjoy what their fathers
had won, and saw not the use. of those austere and arduous virtues by which the State had increased to its present greatness. The votaries of this feE ascribed the formation of the world to chance, and denied the existence of Providence. They re- solved the diftindions of right and wrong, of ho- nour and dishonour, into mere appellations of plea- sure and pain. Every man'spleafure was to him- self the supreme rule of estimation and of action. All good was private. The public was a mere imposture, that might be successfully employed, perhaps to defraud the ignorant of their private enjoyments, while it furnimied the conveniences of the wife . By persons so instructed, the care of families and of states, with whatever else broke in upon the enjoyments of pleasure and ease, were claifed among the follies of human life. And a led under these imputations might be confidered as patrons of licentiousness, both in morality and religion, and declared enemies to mankind. Yet the Epicureans, when urged in argument by their opponents, made some concessions in religion, and many more in morality.

chief. A concession after which they ought to have c H A P. said that virtue or the chief pleasure was also the xv'_ . chief good, yet they frill returned to the general ap- pellation of pleasure, at the hazard of misleading the vulgar and even themselves in their choice '; and while they contended that their difference with o- ther fedts consisted in a mere dispute about words, those they were pleased to employ, served to sup- press the specific sentiments of conscience and ele- vatoin of mind, and to change the reproaches of criminality, profligacy, or vileness, by which even bad men are restrained from iniquity, into mere imputations of mistake, or variations of taste.
Other seaes, particularly that of the Stoicks, maintained, almost in every particular, the re- verse of these tenets. lThey maintained the rea- lity of Providence, and of a common interest of goodness and of justice, for which Providence was exerted, and in which all rational creatures were deeply concerned. They maintained, that although it be evident that happiness or the chief good is pleasant; yet it were albfil-r conversely to fay, that every pleaiure is happincts or the chief good. In

To him tile rearing of a family, without which the human race mlmn speedily pc- rilh; the offices of State, without which society cannot cxilt; were not only !i.peifluons, but expressly precluded from the choice of a wife nan.

c H A P. the application of there terms we must attend to ,_-^ the exemption from suffering, as well as the mea-
sure of enjoyment; and as our understanding can- not reach every possible effect upon which to efti- mate the least measure of pain, and the greatest of pleasure, Providence has not left us to the effect of such a discussion: we are taught to choose, on the first infpetion of things, the part of the in- nocent, of the praise-worthy and just: Of this choice the pleasure is most delightful, and the sense of having failed in it, the most grievous pain; in so much, that although in the nature of things there are many grounds upon which we prefer or reject the objects that present themselves to us, yet the choice which we make, and our own ations, not the event of our efforts, decides our happi- ness or our misery; that right and wrong are the most important and the only grounds upon which we can at all times safely proceed in our choice, and that, in comparison to this difference, every thing else is of no account; that a just man will ever ad as if there was nothing good but what is right, and nothing evil but what is wrong; that the Epicureans mistook human nature when they supposed all its principles resolvable into appetites for pl.afure, or aversions to pain; that honour and diihonour, excellence and defec, were confidera- tions which not only led to much nobler ends, but which were of much greater power in command- ing the human will; the love of pleasure was gro- veling and vile, was the source of dissipation and
of
of sloth; tlhe love of excellence and honour was C HA P. aspiring and noble, and led to the greatest exer- .VIL tions and the highest attainments of our nature. They maintained that there is no private good separate from the public; that the fame quali- ties of the understanding and the heart, wisdom, benevolence, and courage, which are good for the individual, are so likewise for the public; that these blessings every man may poflefs, indepen- dent of fortune or the will of other men; and that whoever does possess them has nothing to hope, and nothing to fear, and can have but one fort of emotion, that of fatisfation and joy; that his as- fedtions, and the maxims of his ifation, as a crea- ture of God, and as a member of society, lead him to ad for the good of mankind; and that for himself he has nothing more to desire, than the happiness of ating this part. These, they said, were the tenets of reason leading to a perfection, which ought to be the aim of every person who means to preserve his integrity, or to consult his happiness, and towards which every one may ad- vance, although no one has atually reached it.
In these disputes the celebrated fable of Pro- dicus seemed to be realized; and as virtue and pleasure there contended for the ear of youth, in- tegrity and corruption now strove for acceptance with a pampered and restless people.
Among those on whom the public fortune fee-c; ed to depend, Cefar is said to have embraced the doctrines of Epicurus; Cato those of 7,cno. The

CHAP. firfi, from indifference to moral diftindtions, in ,xvn. compliance with fashion, or from the bias of an
original temper. The other, from the force of conviction, as wvell as from the predilection of a warm and ingenuous mind. When such charac- ters occur together, it is impofIible not to fee them in contrait. And Sallust in relating what pafied in the Senate, on the iubjed of the Cataline confpi- racy, seens to overlook every other characder, to dwell upon these alone. Cxfar, at the time when this historian flourished, had many claims to his notice ; but Cato could owe it to nothing but the force of truth. He was distinguished from his infancy by an ardent and afectionate disposition. This part of his chara.cer is mentioned on occaiion of his attachment to his brother Capio, and the vehement Iorrow wit'h which he was seized at his death. It is mentioned, on occasion of his visit to the Dictator Sylla, when he was with d ifficulty re- firained, by the discretion of his tutor, from some ac or expreflion of indignation against this real or apparent violator of public justice. He had from his infancy, according to Plutarch, a resolution, a A:eadincfs, and a composure of mind, not to be mo- -ed by fl ttryv, nor to be ihaken by threats. 'Without ftwninig or insinuation, lie was the ta- olri te, o'f lis companions, and had, by his una'- !:ced generosity and courage, the principal place hii their confidence. Though in appearance stern
and S2., ;::; -c.:<.L hinci!f to Cxa:ar, and wsas emlpk'yced b ;i iii i i tie civil
and inflexible, he was warm in his affections, and c Is A '. zealous in the cause of innocence and justice. x vL Such are the marks of an original temper, affixed by historians as the characers of his infancy and early youth. So fitted by nature, he imbibed with ease an opinion, that profligacy, cowardice, and malice, were the only evils to be feared; courage, integrity, and benevolence, the only good to be coveted; and that the proper care of a man on every occasion is, not what is to happen to him, but what he himself is to do. With this profef- sion he became a striking contrast to many of his contemporaries; and to Cwefar in particular, not only a contrast, but a resolute opponent; and al- though in these times he could not furnith a sus- ficient counterpoise, yet he afforded always much weight to be thrown into the opposite scale. They v'cre both of undaunted courage, and -of great pe- netration; the one to diftinguiifl what was bet ; the other to avail himself of the most effeq&ual means for the attainment of any end on which he was bent. It were to mistake entirely the scene in which they were engaged, to judge of their abili- ties from the event of their different pursuits. Those of Cato were by their nature in direct op- polition to the current of manners, and they were a series of struggles with almofi insurmountable difficulties: those of Caxfar went with the tre.am, and except when he was jostled in the competition with others who ran the fame co.urle with himself, he had only to ftize the advmataecs cf which the
~s XC~vices
c HA r. vices and weaknesses of the times gave him an easy xvIII. L.Lr poiffefion. Cato endeavoured to preserve the order
of civil government, howev or desperate, because this was the part it became him to ad, and in which he chose to live and to die. Cefar hastened its ruin ; because he was eager for power, and wiihed to dif- pose of all the wealth and honours of the State at his own discretion.
Caesar, as versatile in his genius, as Cato was steady and inflexible, could personate any charac- ter, and support any cause; in debate he could derive his arguments from any topic; from topics of pity, of which he was insensible; from topics ofjuftice and public good, for which he had no regard. His vigour in refilting personal insults or attacks appeared in his early youth, when he with- stood the imperious commands of Sylla to part with his wife, the daughter of Cinna, and when he revenged the violence done by the pirates to himself; but while his temper might be supposed the most animated and warm, he was not involved .in business by a predilection for any of the inte- refts on which the People was divided. So long as the appetites of youth were sufficient to occupy him, he saw every obje&c of State, or of faction, with indifference, and took no part in public as- fairs. But even irn this period, by his application and genius, in both of which he was eminent, he made a distinguished progress in letters and elo- quence. When he turned his mind to objets of ambition, the fame personal vigour which appear- ed in his youth, became still more conspicuous;
but,
but, unfortunately, this pafflon, the most energe- c HA P tic and powerful in the human mind, instead of Xv.'- urging to genuine greatness, and elevation of na- ture, was in him a mere principle of competition among the leaders of faction at Rome. He had attained to feven-and-thirty years of age before he took any considerable part as a member of the com- monwealth. He then courted the populace in pre- ference to the Senate or better fort of the Peo- ple, and made his first appearance in support of the profligate, against the forms and authority of government. With persons of desperate fortune and abandoned manners, he early bore the cha- racers of liberality and friendship , was received among them as a generous spirit, come to explode the morose severity of those who would reltrain the freedom of youth within the limits of fobrie- ty and public order. Though himself a person of the greatest abilities, and the most accomplish- ed talents, having an opportunity to live on terms of equality with the greatest men that have yet appeared in the world, he chore to Ilart up as the chief among those who, being abandoned to every vice, saw the remains of virtue in their country with distaste and aversion. In proportion as he emerged from the avocations of pleasure, or from the sloth which accompanies the languor of diffi- pation, his desire to counteraCt the eflablifhed go- vernment of his country, and to make himself maf- ter of the commonwealth, became more and more evident. To this paflion he sacrificed every fen-
VOL. II A a timent
H A P. timent of friendflip or animosity, of honour, inte- ,Vl- reft, resentment, or hatred. The philosophy which
taught men to look for enjoyment indiscriminately wherever it pleased them most, found a ready ac- ceptance in such a disposition. But while he pof- sibly availed himself of the speculations of Epicu- rus to justify his choice of an object, he was not inferior to the followers of Zeno, in vigorous es- forts and active exertions for the attainment of his ends. Being about seven years younger than Pom- pey, and three years older than Cato; the first he oc- cafionally employed as a prop to his own ambition, or at Icaft, in the early part of his career, did not teem to perceive him as a rival; the other, from a fixed animosity of opposite natures, and from hav- ing felt him as a continual opponent in all his de- signs, he sincerely hated.
Cato began his military service in the army which was employed against the gladiators, and concluded it as a legionary Tribune, under the Pretor Rubrius, in Macedonia, while Pompey re- mained in Syria. He was about three-and-thirty years of age when he made his speech in the Se- nate, relating to the accomplices of Cataline; and by the decilive and resolute spirit he had shown on this occasion, came to be confidered as a principal support of the government and authority of the Senate I. To this body, as usual, every flagrant dif- order repreiled, brought an accession of power; and the discovery of a design, so odious as that of Ca-
taline, { r~~:t~iii'.ar h. h.Ct'n. Cd:- Lenr.l;;. p. 238,
taline, covered under popular pretences, greatly c H A P. served to discredit the supposed popular cause. X_ One of the first uses the Senate proposed to make of their advantage, was to have Cato elected among the Tribunes of the subsequent year. His fervi- ces were likely to be wanted in opposition to the schemes of Metellus Nepos, who was then arrived from the army in Syria, with recommendations to public favour as a candidate for the office of Tri- bune ; and if he ihould prevail in the.election 'hy the influence of Pompey, it was not doubted, he came charged with some measure to gratify the ambition or vanity of this insatiable suitor for per- fonal consideration and honour. It had not yet ap- peared what part he was to take in the disputes which were likely to arise on the legality or ex- pedience of the late summary executions; but it is not to be doubted, that he wished to hold the balance of parties, and that he would come prepared for the part that was most likely to pro- mote his own importance. Metellus was sent on before him to be supported by his friends in the competition which was expedced, and with his inftrudions to take such measures as were likely to favour his prctenfions.
The leading men of the Senate were now, for some time, aware of the intrigues of Pompey, and bore, with impatience, the personal superiority which he affected even to the firfi and most re- ipecded men of their order. They took occasion, in the present crisis, to mortify him, by admitting
A a . T2 lclln,
C H A P Lucullus and Metellus Creticus to the triumphs to .XVu1. which, by their refpedive victories in Pontus and
in Crete, they were long entitled. Hitherto the claims of these officers had been over-ruled by the popular faction, either to annoy the Senatorian party, to which they were attached, or to flatter Pompey, who was supposed to be equally averse to the honours of both. They had waited in Italy about three years, and, in the manner of those who sue for a triumph, still retaining the farces or ensigns of their late command 1, had refrained from entering the city.
Lucullus, having obtained the honour that was due to him, seemed to be satisfied with the ac- knowledgment of his right; and, as if merely to show with what fort of enemy he had fought, he entered the city with a few of the Armenian horsemen cared in armour, a few of the armed chariots winged with scythes, and about sixty of the officers and courtiers of Mithridates, who were his captives. He ordered the spoils he had gain- ed, the arms and ensigns of war, the prows of the gallies he had taken, to be displayed in the great circus, and concluded the solemnity with giving a feast to the People. The Senate hoped for his iupport againit the ambition of Pompey, and the factious designs of the popular leaders; but he was disgusted, and from thence forward scarcely ever took a part in the affairs of State.
The triumph of Metellus Creticus did not take place till after the acceflion of P. Junius Silanus
and r Cicero in Lucullo.
and Lucius Murana, Consuls of the following year, c H A P. after whose election, Cicero, before he had vacated xvtL. the office, or laid down the fasces, had occasion to de- fend his intended successor Murmna, against a charge of corruption brought upon the statute of Calpurni- us, by Servius Sulpicius, one of his late competitors, supported by Cato and others. The oration of Cicero on this occasion is still extant, and is a cu- rious example of the topics which, under popular governments, are recurred to even in judicial plead- ings. Great part of it consists in a ridicule of law terms; because Sulpicius, one of the prosecutors, used to give counsel to his friends who consulted him in matters of law; and in a ridicule of the Stoic philosophy, because Cato, another prose- cutor, was supposed to have embraced the doc- trines of that fee. Cato made no other remark on this pleading, but that the republic was pro- vided with a merry Coniul. The argument how- ever appeared sufficiently strong on the fide of Mu- rena, and he was acquitted.
At the close of this trial, Cicero, about to abdigate his power, and being to make the usual affevera- tion, upon oath, That he had faithfully, and to the best of his abilities, dischargcd his trust; pro- posed to introduce this solemnity with a speech to the People, but was ordered by Metellus, already elected, and acting in the capacity of Tribune, to confine himself to the simple terms of his oath. He accordingly refrained from speaking; but in- stead of fwcaring limply, That he had been faith-
A a3 ful
c H A P. fill to his trust, he took an oath, That he had pre- XVIII.
,. served the republic'. It was on this occasion,
probably, that Cato, now another of the Tribunes, addressing himself to the People, and alluding to the suppression of the late conspiracy, called Ci- cero the father of his Country2; and from this time entered upon an opposition to his colleague Metellus, which was not likely to drop while they continued in office. u. c.: eg. Soon after the accession of the new magistrates, D. Juniui silanus, L. a storm began to gather, which, though still aimed
at the party of the Senate, burit at last in a per- fonal attack upon the late Consul, who had been the prompter or instrument of the Senate in the late summary proceedings against the accomplices of Cataline. Metellus Nepos seems to have come from kfia, and to have entered on the office of Tribune, with a particular design to bring about the recep- tion of Pompey with his army into Rome; and in this project he was joined by Caius Cxefar 3, now in the office of Prxtor, who chose to support the Tribune in this measure, as an ad of hostility to the Senate, if not as the means of obtaining a pre- cedent of which he might in his turn avail him- self.
In consequence of a plan concerted with C-efar, the Tribune Metellus moved in the Senate, as had .been usual in the times of its highest authority, for leave to propofc a decree in the assembly of the

People recalling Pompey from Asia at the head of c H A p. his forces, in order to restore the constitution of x.1. the commonwealth, which, in the terms he after- wards employed to the People, had been violated by the arbitrary administration of Cicero. This was the firit attempt of the party to inflame the minds of the People on the subject of the late exe- cutions; and Pompey was, in this manner, offered to the popular party as their leader to avenge the supposed wrongs they had received. Cato, when the matter was proposed in the Senate, endeavour- ed to persuade Metellus to withdraw his motion, reminding him of the dignity of his family, which had been always a principal ornament and support of the State. This treatment served only to raise the presumption of Metellus, and brought on a vio- lent altercation between the Tribunes. The Se- nate applauded Cato, but had not authority enough to prevent the motion which was proposed fromz being made to the People.
Metellus, apprehending an obstinate refirfance from his colleague, endeavoured to fill the place of assembly with his own partizans; and, on the evening before the meeting, in order to intimidate his opponents, paraded in the streets with a nume- rous attendance of men in arms. The friends and relations of the other Tribunes earnestly beseech- ed them not to expose themselves to the dangers with which they were threatened. But, on the following day, the other party being already as- fembled by Metellus, at the temple of Castor, and
A a 4 the
c H A . the place having been in the night occupied by x H. persons under his direction, armed with clubs,
swords, and other offensive weapons ', Cato went forth attended only by Minucius Thermus, another of the Tribunes, and a few friends. They were joined by numbers in the streets, who could not accompany them to their place, being prevented by the multitude of armed men who already crowd- ed the avenues and the steps of the temple. But they themselves, from respect to their office, being suffered to pass, dragged along with them through the crowd, as an aid, in cafe any violence were of- sered, Munatius, a citizen much attached to Cato. When they came to the bench of Tribunes, they found that Metellus, with the Practor Julius Cxe- far, had taken their places there; and that, in or- der to concert their operations in the conduct of this affair, they were closely feated together. Ca- to, to disappoint this intention, forced himself in betwixt them, and, when the ordinary officer be- gan to read the intended decree, interposed his negative, or forbade him to proceed. Metellus himself seized the writing, and began to read; but Cato snatched it out of his hands. Metellus en- deavoured to repeat the substance of it from his memory. Thermus clapt a hand to his mouth. A general silence remained in the assembly, till Me- tellus, having made a signal concerted with his party to clear the comitium of their enemies, a great tu. mult and confusion arose ; and the Tribunes who
opposed X Plutarch in Catone, edit. Londin. . 241, 8&c.
opposed Metellus were in imminent danger. The CH A P. Senators had met in mourning, to mark their sense . XVIII. of the evils which threatened the commonwealth; and now, under the apprehension of some signal calamity, gave a charge to the Consuls to watch over the safety of the State, and empowered them to take such measures as might be necessary to pre, serve or to restore the peace '.
In consequence of this charge, the Consul Mu- rana appeared with a body of men in arms, had the good fortune to rescue Cato and Minucius Thermus; and probably by this seasonable inter- position effaced any remains of misunderstanding which might have subsisted between Cato and himself, on account of the prosecution for bribery which followed the late elections '.
Metellus, after the tumult was composed, hav- ing again obtained silence, began to read the pro- posed decree; but the Senatorian party, headed by the Consuls, being then in the comitium, he found it impossible to proceed; and, together with the Praetor Caius Caesar, retired from the assembly. From this time, these officers made no attempt to resume their motion, but complain- ed that the government was usurped by a violent faction, under whom even the persons of the Tri- bunes were unsafe ; and Metellus, as if forced to break through the rules which obliged the Tri- bunes to conitant residence at Rome, abandoned
the x Plutarch. in Catone, edit. Londin. p. 141, &C, a Plutarch, ibid.
C H A P. the city, even left Italy, and fled to the camp of --_I, Pompey in Asia, from which he had but lately set
out on his journey to Rome '. He had already threatened his opponents in the city with the re- fentment and military power of his general, and now endeavoured to excite the army and their com- mander to follow the example which had been set to them by Sylla and his legions, when oppressed citizens, a description which he now assumed to himself, fled to them for protecion and revenge.
It may well be supposed, that Caesar, remember- ing his own escape from the ruin of the Marian faction, and confidering Pompey as the head of an opposite interest, and a principal obstacle to his own ambition, muff look upon him with some de- gree of personal dislike and animosity; but his con- dud on this occasion sufficiently showed how little he was the dupe of any passion or sentiment which had a tendency to check his pursuits. Meaning for the present only to weaken the Senate, and to partake in the favour which Pompey enjoyed with the People; he undertook the cause even of a ri- val, and would have joined the populace, in deli- vering the commonwealth into his hands, rather than remain under a government which he confi- dered as the principal bar to his own elevation. But if he really meant to overthrow the Senate by force, he mistook his instrument. Pompey, no doubt, aspired to be the first among citizens, and wished for the ostentation of military power at
Rome; z Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvii. c. 43.
Rome; but even this he desired to receive as the c H AP. fruit of consideration and personal refped; and he xv . ever hoped to make the People bestow it, and even force him to accept of it as their gift. For this purpose he encouraged so many agents and re- tainers to found.his own praise; and for this pur- pose he had recently sent Metellus Nepos from his camp in Asia to take upon him the functions of a popular Tribune at Rome; but having failed in the project of vanity, his mind mifgave him in the project of force. No one ever courted diftinaion with a more incessant emulation to his rivals; but he was entirely dependent on the public opinion for any fatisfaftion he enjoyed in the possession of power. Trusting perhaps to this part of his charac- ter, Caesar, though no way remiss as a rival, was not yet alarmed at the elevation of Pompey, and thought that he was safe in admitting him to govern with the sword at Rome. Pompey was, at this con- .uncture, with his army moving. towards Italy, and his approach was matter of great apprehension to the friends of the commonwealth, who feared that, in return to the affront of his not being invited, upon the motion of Metellus, to come with his army, he would employ it in person to enforce his commands. Upon his arrival at Brundisium, how- ever, as formerly upon his return from Africa, he dispelled those fears by an immediate dismission of the troops, with infirutions, merely that they should attend at his triumph. He himself came forward to Romc w.ith !1he single equipage of his Procon-
fular
c H A P. fular rank. Multitudes of every condition went .XVIL forth to receive him, and with shouts and accla-
mations recompenfed the moderation with which he acquiesced in the condition of a citizen.
Cafar, from whatever motive he acted in regard to Pompey, gave every other sign of difaffedion to the Senate, and employed the name of this ri- ling favourite of the People, to mortify such of the members in particular as were objects of personal animosity to himself. The repairs or rebuilding of the Capitol being finished about this time, the honour of dedicating the edifice, and of being named in the inscription it was to bear, was, by a resolution of the Senate, conferred on Catulus, under whose infpedion the work had been execu- ted. But Cxfar, affecting to obtain this honour for Pompey, alleged that Catulus had embezzled the money allotted for the service.; that much yet remained to be done; and moved, that the inscription of Catulus should be erased; that the completion of the work being left to Pompey, ihould carry an inscription with his name 1. Here he probably aced as much from antipathy to one, as from an intention to flatter the other. But the design being extremely odious to the whole body of the Nobles, who saw, with indignation, in that proposal, an attempt to affront a most refpedable citizen, in order to flatter the vanity of one per- ion, and to gratify the profligate refcntments of
another; z Sueton. in Jul. Cesare, c. 15.
another; under this aspea of the business, Cxefar c H A P. was obliged to withdraw his motion '.
It was probably during this year in which Ca- far was Proetor, and before the arrival of Pompey from Asia (although historians refer it to an earli- er date), that Cxefar promoted, as has been already mentioned, prosecutions upon a charge of affaffina- tion against some of the persons concerned in the execution of Sylla's proscriptions. The Praetors had in charge by lot to superintend the application of particular laws. The law respecting assassination appears to have been the lot of Caesar; and he was entitled, in virtue of his office, the jurifdicion of which was still very arbitrary, to extend, by his ediCt or plan of proceeding for the year, the de- scription of the crime under his cognizance to any special cafe.
While he seemed to have formed so many de- signs against the peace of the commonwealth, and in the capacity of Praetor supported them with the authority of a magistrate, the Senatorian party made a powerful exertion of their influence to have him suspended, and aCtually obtained a de- cree for this purpofc. He affected at firfi to flight their authority; but finding that a power was preparing to enforce it, perhaps at the hazard of his life, he laid aside for some time the robes and badges of magistracy, dismissed his Lidors, and ab- stained from the functions of Prxtor, until, having rejected an offer of the People to restore him by
force, X Din. Ca 1. li. x'vii. c. 44
cHA . force, he was, with proper marks of regard, for ,_-~ lthis inflance of moderation and duty, reinstated by
an aft of the Senate itself'.
The ariftocratical party, meanwhile, to confirm and perpetuate the evidence on which they had proceeded against the accomplices of Cataline, continued their prosecutions on this subjed, and obtained sentence of condemnation, in parti- cular, against a citizen of the name of Vergun- teius, and against Autronius, who, about two years before, having been eleded Consul, was set aside upon a charge of bribery; and who, from the dif- gust which he took to the Senate upon that occa- sion, had conneted himself with the more defpe- rate party. · Publius Sylla, as has been mentioned, was also tried; but upon the pleading and tefti- mony of Cicero, who poffelfed all the information obtained on this subjed, was honourably acquit- ted.
Caesar likewise was accused by Vedius as ac- ceffary to the conspiracy of Cataline; but it is not likely that he was concerned farther than by the general encouragement he gave to every party at variance with the Senate. Opposition to this body was reputed the cause of the People, and was pre- tended by every person who had any passions to gratify by crimes of State, or who wished to weak- en the government, to which they themselves were accountable. Among the supporters of this in- terest, Crassus also was accused, but probably on no better grounds than Cefar.

The whole of these proceedings, however, were c H A P. suspended by the approach of Pompey. This xv . leader had now drawn the attention of all men upon himself, was quoted in every harangue as the great support of the empire, and courted by mul- titudes, who, without inquiry, or knowledge of his person affeced to be classed with his admirers and friends. While the contagion spread, like a faflhion, among the People. He himself affeded indiffe- rence to this mighty tide of renown, though not without much dignity and state, which he tem- pered with affability and grace; employing the greatness he possessed to give the more value to his condescensions. His manner, though acceptable to the People and the army he commanded, was disagreeable to the Senate. Having previously sent Pifo, one of his lieutenants, before him to tand for the Consulate, he had the presumption to de- fire that the Senate would defer the elections un- til he himself could be present to canvass for his friend. The Senate, according to Dio, complied with his desire; but, according to Plu/rch, re- jeded the proposal with disdain. This author im- putes the resolution, which they took upon this occasion, to Cato, and subjoins, that Pompey as- terwards endeavoured to gain this opponent by a proposed marriage with one of his near relations; and that Cato declined the connection, faying, That he flould not be caught in a female Inare. Pifo, however, was eleced together with Valerius Meffala, and entered on his office before the folem- nity of Pompey's triumph.

To this pom- pous lift, it was subjoined by his friends, that, this being his third triumph, he had now made a round of the known world, or had triumphed over all the three parts of the earth, Africa, Europe, and Asia.
After rewarding the soldiers, of whom none re- ceived less than fifteen hundred delqarii2, he carried to the treasury twenty thousand talents 3.

rii, and the Commageni, together with trophies for c H, P. every battle he had fought, making in all a more xv-t. splendid exhibition than any that was to be found on the records of the State.
The triumphal processions of Pompey merit more attention than those of any other person, be- cause they exhibit his character as well as military success. Others took the benefit of an eftablifled practice to publish and to ratify the honours they had acquired; but Pompey, it is likely, would have invented the triumph, even if it had not been formerly thought of; and it is not to be doubted, that he over-ran some provinces in which the ene- my were subdued, or in which they were so weak, as not to be able to make any refiiance, merely to place them in the lift of his conqueits; and that he made some part of his progress in Asia merely to accumulate trophies and ornaments for this pompous scene.
The triumph, in its ordinary form, confited only of such exhibitions as had a reference to the service in which it was obtained; the captives and spoils of the enemy, with effigies or representations of the first, where the originals, by any accident, could not be displayed. But in the folemnities intlitu- ted for the honour of Pompey, were admitted what- ever could distinguish or signalize the occasion. Among there, according to the record transcribed by Pliny', there were many coitly ornaments of gold and of precious flones, not takexn from the

made of one entire. crystal; a model of the moon in gold, weighing thirty pondo; tables, utensils, ffatues, crowns adorned with precious stones, the representation also of an entire mountain in gold, with its herds of deer, and other animals, haunted with lions: and what serves as an evidence that these exhibitions were not limited to the spoils actually taken in war, there is mentioned an effigy of Pompey himself incruited with pearls. The whole conduEted with more arrangement and or- der, than were necfefary, perhaps, in the difpofi- tion made for any of the battles which the triumph was intended to celebrate.
Among the images, representations, and memo- riais which were carried before the victor on this occasion, there was held up to view a slate of the public finance, from which it appeared, that be- fore Pompey's time the revenue amounted to no more than fifty millions ; and that the addition which he alone brought to it amounted to eighty- five millions 2.
Soon after this pomp was over, an aflembly of the People was called in the Circus Flaminius, to re- ceive an address from the victorious commander: but, from an extreme caution not to offend any par- ty, the speech which he made, upon this occalion, was acceptable to none. " It gave no hopes," fays

Pompey was suffered to pof-. fess the highest place in the conlideration of the public, merely because he assumed it; and he pre- ferved'his dignity, by never committing his repu- tation without being prepared, or without having concerted a variety of arts by which it might be supported 2.
Bb 2 CHAP. i Cicer. ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. 14. 2 Sallust in Catalin. c. 54. in contrasting the characers of Cefar and Cd. to, does not propose to decide on the comparativ- merit of their objects: for this he aflumes to have been consideration or glory, and the fame in both; but in reality he seems to have mistaken the object of either. That of Ce- far was not consideration: for although he courted the public opinion, when subservient to his power; yet he flighted it also, when it tsood in his way to dominion. In the objet of Cato, consideration had no fliare. His life was distinguished by the general tenor of reason, integrity, humanity and justice, in the public cause, whatever the world might think of his condut. And his resolution often led him into measures, iunfccefsful from the want of co- operation in a corrupt or misguided age. The great diltinction of Pompey, if we insert his character into this comparison, was the prevailing attention to consideration or. glory, in preference to either virtue or power.

Caius Antonius, the late colleague of Cicero in the Consulate, soon after the defeat of Cataline, proceeded to the province of Macedonia, of which, by the arrangements of the year, he had been ap- pointed the governor. He entered his province with the ensigns of vicory, which had been ob- tained by the defeat of Cataline; but these he soon forfeited by his mifcondut in a war againfl
the
the Thracians, and by the disgrace which he other- c H A P, wife incurred in the mal-administration of his _ . province. Complaints were exhibited against him for extortion. On this occasion, it had been re- ported by himself, or by some of his family, that, having agreed to divide the profits of his govern- ment with Cicero, part only of his exacions was made on his own account. This allegation, Cice- ro, in a letter to Atticus, mentions with scorn ; and, being asked to undertake the defence of An- - tonius, questions whether he can decently do so under this imputation'. But as he soon after- wards'undertook the cause, and employed his inte- reft to have the Proconsul continued in his pro- vince, it is probable that this imputation either gained no credit, or was entirely removed .
The Allobroges, though deprived of the sup- port they were made to expect from the party of Cataline, nevertheless took arms, and invaded the Roman province of Gaul. After a variety of events, they were repulsed by Pontinius, who then commanded the legions in that quarter, and forced to retire into their own country 3.
About the fame time, ICaius Julius Cwfar, upon the expiration of his term in the office of Prator, obtained his firIt military command, being ap- pointed by lot to the government of Lusitania where, under different pretences, he found an op-

C H A P. portunity to quarrel with the natives, to fliew his
own capacity for war, and to lay some ground for his claim to a triumph 1. In pufling his way to the preferments which he now held in the State, hc had ruined his fortune by largesses, public ihews, and entertainments to the People, by his lavifil bounty in private to needy and profligate citizens, and in. supporting every desperate cause against the Senate and the government; and is reported to have said of himself, when he set out for his province, that he needed one hundred and fifty millions Roman money, or one million two hun- dred thousand pounds sterling, to be worth no- thing 2. When about to depart from the city, he was pressed by his creditors, and had recourse to Crassus, who became his surety for great films 3.
A person who, in any other state than that of Rome, could fippofe such a fortune reparable, must have thought of means alarming to the State itself; but Caesar had now quitted the paths of pleasure for those of ambition; and, in an empire which extended over lo many opulent provinces, needed only to have power, in order to become rich. Although the province which now fell to his lot was not the most wealthy, or was only a ftep to somewhat farther, more considerable, and more likely to supply him with the means of pur- suing his objects, he was nevertheless reported,

even there, to have supplied his own wants, and to c II P. have enriched his army'.

" Aly," said Cafar, with a charaderiflical confellion, " and 1 would rather "be tbefirlf man in this place, than the Jfcond at " Rome 2" Upon his arrival in Lusitania, he made the necefiary augmentation of the army, and soon over-ran all the diftrids that were dif- posed to resist his authority. With the fame ability with which he conducted his military ope- rations, he supported the dignity of a Roman governor, no less in the civil than in the de- partment of war. Historians, upon 1a idea which occurred to them, that the disorder in his own as: f:irs might have rendered him partial to insolvent debtors, and being at pains to acquit him of any such charge, observe. that he gave proofs of the contrary, among which they specify a rule which he followed, in ordering two thirds of the debtor's eflects to be sequestered for the use of his credi- tors 3.
While these things passed in the provinces, the People being indulged in their favourite gratifica- tions, suffered an increase of the political diftem- pers with which the public had been for some time insetcd. The expence and dissipation at- tending the public shews, in particular, were aug_ mented to a great degree. Lucius Domitius Ahe-

The office of Censor, as appears from the tran- facions which are mentioned relating to the farms of the revenue and the rolls of the Senate, was in adual exertion at this time, although the names of the persons by whom it was exercised are not recorded. These officers are said to have let the revenues of Asia at a rate, of which the farmers afterwards complained, alleging, that their own avidity in grasping at the profits to be made in this new province had milled them *3 The Censors like- wife put upon the rolls of the Senate all who had ever held any office of magistracy, and by this ad- dition increased the number of members beyond the former and ordinary rate 4.
About the fame time happened the memorable trial of Publius Clodius, for the scandal he had given by profaning the sacred rites in Cefar's house. This debauchee was supposed, for some time, to have fought for an opportunity of a cri- minal correspondence with Pompeia, Cefar's wife; but to have been prevented, if not by her own dif- cretion, at least by the attention and vigilance of
her Plin. Nat. Hilt. lib. viii.'c. 36. a Dio. CaT. lib. xxxvii. c. 47. 3 Cicer. ad Attictm, lib. i. ep. 17. 4 Dio. lib. Jxxvii. c. 46.
her family . In there circumstances, during the c HA P. preceding year, it fell to the lot of Pompeia, as XLX. being wife to one of the Prators in office, to cele- brate, at her house, the festival of a certain female deity ' worshipped by the Romans; and at whose rites women alone were admitted. Every male domestic, even the huiband, was obliged to absent himself from home while the rites were admi- niftered. Clodius took this opportunity to carry on his intrigue; put himself in a female dress, and, being young and of an effeminate asped, ex- pe6ted to pass for a woman 3. Pompeia was sup- posed to be apprised of the design, and to have flationed a female slave to receive and conduct her paramour through the apartments. But being met by another slave who was not in the secret, his voice betrayed him. A cry of amazement and horror was immediately communicated through all the apartments, and the occasion of it discovered to the matrons, who were met to celebrate the rites. Clodius escaped, but not without being known. The college of Pontiffs made a report, that the sacred rites had been profaned. The Se- nate resolved, that inquiry should be made into the grounds of the scandal; and that the People ihould be moved to authorise the Pretor in of- fice to felet, without drawing lots, proper judges for the trial of the accused.
Clodius, x Plutarch. in Cesare, edit. Lond. p. og9. a Called the Bona & Dea. 3 Cicero ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. rs, x3.
C HA P. Clodius, by the suspicion of an incestuous com-
merce with his own fiter, the wife of Lucullus; by his perfidy in reducing the troops of that ge- neral to mutiny, and by his profligacy on every occasion, had incurred a general detestation; and many of the Senators, as the likeliest way of re- moving him from the commonwealth, combined in urging the present prosecution against him.
He himself, foreseeing the itorm, had taken re- fuge in the popular party, and endeavoured to silence the voice of infamy, by professing extraordi- nary zeal for the People, and vehement opposition to the Senate. These parties accordingly became interested in the issue of his cause. The popular leaders endeavoured to preserve him as an useful instrument, and the Senate to remove him, as a vile and dangerous tool, from the hands of their enemies. Even Cafar, though personally insulted, and so far moved by the scandal which had been given in his own house as to part with his wife, fill affected to confider as groundless the charge which was laid against Clodius; and being asked, why he had parted with a woman who, upon this supposition, mufl appear to be innocent, said, that his wife mutl not only be innocent, but above imputation. Pompey, to avoid giving offence, declined to favour either party; but being called upon in the assembly of the People to declare his opinion, whether this trial should proceed according to the decree of the Senate; made a long speech, full of refped to the Nobles, and of
submission
submission to the Senate, whose authority, in all c H A P. questions of this fort, he said, flhould ever with x--- him have the greatest weight. He afterwards, in the Senate itself, being called upon by Meflala the Consul, delivered himself to the fame purpose; and when he had done, whispered Cicero, who fat by him, that he thought he had now sufficiently ex- plained himself; intimating probably, that he meant to comprehend, in this declaration, also his judg- ment with refped to all the ads of the Senate which had pafled relating to the accomplices of Cataline '.
The Consul Pifo was inftruded to carry to the People, for their assent, an ad for the better con- dut of the trial of Clodius, dispensing with the usual mode of draughting the judges by lot, and authorising the Prator to feled them, that he might name the more refpetable persons. On the day on which this motion was to be made, a nu- merous party of young Nobility appeared for the defendant. His hirelings and retainers crowded the Comitium. Even Pifo, who moved the que- stion, difluaded the People from passing the law, and allowed the friends of Clodius to put a ridi- culous trick on the assembly, by distributing to the People, as they came forward to vote, two ballots, which, instead of being, as usual, one negative and the other affirmative, were both negative. This trick being observed, Cato, with the authority of Tribune, suspended the ballot, and firongly re- monftrated agai.ft the proceeding of the Consul 2.
In i Cicero ad Atticum, lib. i. epift. 13, 14. i6. X Ibid.
CH A P. In this he was supported by Hortenfius and Favo- ' X. nius. The assembly broke up, and the affair again
returned to the Senate. The members were im- portuned by Clodius, who cast himself at their feet as they entered; they, nevertheless, confirmed their former resolution by a majority of four hun- dred to fifteen '.
Hortenfius, however, having proposed that, in- flead of the motion which the Consuls had been inftruaed to make for the feletion of the judges, the Tribune Fuiius ihould move the People to grant commission for the trial, leaving the judges, as usual, to be drawn by lot; an edid was accor- dingly framed and passed to this effet. Horten- iius, who conducted the trial, was confident that no jury could acquit the accused. And the court, in all their proceedings, seemed at first inclined to severity. They even applied for a guard to pro- tea their persons againit the partizans of the cri- minal; but the majority, nevertheless, it was alle- ged, suffered themselves to be corrupted, or took money in the course of the trial. Of fifty-fix judges that were inclosed, twenty-five gave their voice to condemn, and thirty-one to acquit. Ca- tulus, on this occasion, asked the majority to what purpose they had desired a guard? "Was it," he laid, with a sarcasm, which modern juries could ill endure, " to secure the money you expected to "receive for your votes '?"
Soon after this judgment the Senate resolved that inquiry ihould be made concerning those
judges I Cicer. ad Att. lib. i. cpift. I3, 14, x6. iDio. Call lib. xxxvii. c. 46. Cicero ad Att. lib. i. cp. x6.
judges who had been corrupted in the trial. And c H A P. by this resolution gave a general offence to the XIX. Equestrian order, who confidered it as an imputa- tion on their whole body '.
Pompey, in the course of this tranfadion, had been obliged to declare himself for the Senate; but his objea was to be on good terms with all parties, and to manage his interest, by having some of his creatures always chosen into the highest of- sices of State. He offered, as candidate for the Con- fulate of the following year, Afranius, one of his dependants, who is represented by Cicero as a per- son of mean character, and who, having no per- fonal dignity, nor any credit with the People, was to be supported in his canvass by money alone. Pompey himself, and the Consul Pifo, openly em- ployed bribery in obtaining votes in his favour :.
A variety of resolutions were obtained in the Senate to restrain these practices. Two of them were proposed by Cato and Domitius. The first was levelled against the Consul Pifo himself, and gave permiflion, on the suspicion of illicit practices re- specting elections, to visit the house even of a magi- ftrate. By the other it was declared, that all those who were found difiributing money to the People should be confidered as enemies to their country 3.
The Senate, at the fame time, encouraged Lur- co, one of the Tribunes, to propose a new clause to corroborate the laws against bribery. By this
clause z Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvi. c. 46. Cicero ad Att. lib. i. ep. 17. 2 Cicero ad Att. lib. i. en. 16 3 Ibid.
C H A P. clause promises of money made to the People, if
. not performed, did not infer guilt; but, if per- formed, fubjeded the guilty person from thence- forward to pay to each of the Tribes an annual tax of three thousand Roman money, or about twenty-four pounds sterling; and there being thirty-five Tribes, this tax amounted in all to about eight hundred and forty pounds of our money. That the Tribune might riot be interrupted in carrying this law, the Senate farther resolved, that the formalities or reftridions of the Lex LElia and Fufial mhould not be opposed to himz. It ap- pears, however, that the liberality or other influ- ence of Pompey prevailed against these precau- tions, as Afranius was eleced, together with Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer.
Soon after the election of there officers the far- mers of the revenue of Asia, supported by the whole Equestrian order, complained, as has been mentioned, of the terms of their contract, in which they alleged that they had greatly exceeded what the funds of that province could afford, and made application to the Senate for relief. Their plea was contelted for some months with great animosity on both rides 3.
Upon the accession of the new Consuls, several other matters, tending to innovation and public disturbance, were introduced. Metellus Nepos, late Tribune, being now in the office of Praetor,
procured i These were formalitice and reflriaions provided to check the precipi- tate passing of laws.
2 Cicer. ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. i6. 3 Cicero ad Att. lib, i. rp. 17, i8.
procured a law to aboliih the customs payable at c H A P. any of the ports of Italy. The Romans, as has. X' been observed, upon the acceffibn of wealth de- rived from Macedonia, had exempted themselves from all the antient assessments, and they now completed the exemption of all the Italians from every tax besides that of. quit-rents for public lands, and the twentieth penny on the value of slaves when fold or emancipated. They were be- come the sovereigns of a great empire, and as such, thought themselves entitled to receive, not obliged to pay, contributions 1.
The Tribune Herennius, at the fame time, made a motion for an ad to enable Publius Clo- dius to be adopted into a Plebeian family, which, though an ad of a more private nature than any of the former, tended still more to embroil the parties of the Senate and the People. This sac- tious and profligate person had entertained great resentments against many of the Senators on ac- count of the prosecution he had lately incurred, and against Cicero in particular, who, having been called as an evidence on his trial, gave a very un- favourable account of his charader. The fum- mary proceedings against the accomplices of Cata- line, in which Cicero presided as Consul, exposed him to the resentment of the popular facion; and Clodius now proposed to qualify himself to be eleCted Tribune of the People, in order to wreck his vengeance on that magistrate in particular, as
well z Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. ep. 16. Dio. Cafi. is. vii. c, St.
cHAP. well as on the other abettors of the Senatorian
,'. party. The motion, however, for the present was
rejeded, though not finally dropt, either by Clodius himself, or by the popular faction, whose cause he professed to espouse '.
Two other motions were made in which Pom- pey was deeply interested: one, to ratify and con- firm all his ads in the province of Asia: another, to procure settlements for the veterans who had terved under his command. The firit, as it im- plied a refletion on Lucullus, many of whose judgments Pompey had reverted, routed this dtatef- man from the care of his household and his table, to that of the republic I. He opposed this mo- tion with vigour, and insisted that the ads of Pom- pey should be Separately examined, and not con- firmed in a tingle vote. In this he was supported by Catulus, by Cato, by the Consul Metellus, and by the Senate in general. Afranius, though vest- ed with the Consulate, and acting almost as the a- gent of Pompey, had neither dignity nor force to support filch a measure; and Pompey, finding it rejected by the Senate, declined carrying it to the People 3.
The other proposal, relating to the allotment of settlements for the soldiers of Pompey, was, by L. Flavius, one of the Tribunes, moved in the afiem- bly of the People, under the title of an Agrarian Law. In this ad, to guard against the imputation of
partiality I Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvii. c. Sr. 2 Plutarch. in Lucullo, edit. Lond. p. z97, 3 Dio. lib. xxtvii, c. 49.
partiality to any particular class, certain means of c H A.P,
XLX; relief were projected for the indigent citizens in ge-. neral ; and, to enable the commonwealth to extend its bounty, it was proposed first of all to revoke the conveyance of certain lands, which, having be- longed to the public in the Consulate of P. Mu- cius and L. Calpurnius, were fold by the Senate; and that the price [hould be restored to the pur- chafers. It was proposed, likewise, to seize cer- tain lands which had been confiscated by Sylla, but not appropriated to any particular use; and to allot, during five years, the fruits of the recent conquests in Asia to purchase settlements, which ihould be distributed in terms of this aft .
The Consul Metellus Celer, supported by the Se- nate, strenuously opposed the passing of this law. But the Tribune persisted with great obstinacy, and, to remove the obftrution he met with, committed the Consul to prison. The whole Senate would have attended him thither, and numbers accord- ingly crowded to the place, when the Tribune, veiled with the sacred defences of his person, to bar their way, planted his stool or chair of office in the door of the prison; and, having feated him- self upon it, " This way," he said, " you cannot " pass; if you mean to enter, you mutt pierce "through the walls 3 ." He declared his refolu- tion to remain all night where he fat. The par- ties were colleding their strength, and matters were
VOL. II. C c likely i Dio. lib. 1. a Cicer. lad Att. lib. i. ep To. 3 Dio. lib. xxxvii. p. £7.
c H A P. likely to end in greater extremities than'fuited tlie .XX. indirct and cautious conduc of Pompey. This
politician, although he engaged all his friends to support the motion of Flavius, affected to have no part in the measure, and now probably in secret inftruled the Tribune to remove from the doors of the prison. This at leaft:might be fufpe&ed from the sudden resolution of the Tribune, to give way, faying that he did so at the request of the prisoner, who begged for his -liierty .
It is supposed that Pompey, on this occasion, fe- verely felt the checks which his ambition received from the Senate; that he regretted, for a moment, the dismission of his army, and wished himself in condition to enforce what his craft or his artifice had not been able to obtain. The error he had committed in refignring- the sword, if he :cbnceived it-as such, might have' still been corrected by reco- vering the possession of some considerable province, which would have given him the command of an army and of proper resources to support his power. He, nevertheless, appears to have preferred the scene of intrigue in the city and the capital of the empire; a choice in which he was probably con- firmed by Cifar, who profefled great attachment to him, and who was about this time returned from the government which he held as Proprietor in Lusitania.
This officer, according to Dio, had found some pretence for a' war with the nations on the fron-
tier D.Q, lib. xxxvii. p. 5-.
tier of the Roman province; had obliged them to c ,r A F. take refuge in some of the islands on the coast, and AX, afterwards subdued them in that retreat. His objec was to return to resign his coimmand with the reputa- tion of victory, to obtain a triumph, and to offer hiri- self as a candidate for the Consulship 6f the follow- ing year. For this purpose he quitted his province without waiting for a fuccefror, and, upon his ar- rival at Rome, halted, as usual, with the ensigns of his military rank at the gates of the city, applied for a triumph, and at the fame time made interest for votes at the approaching election . The Se- nate, and the friends of the republic in general, were already become extremely jealous of his de- signs, and of his credit with the People. From a li- bertine he was become an ardent politician, seemed to have no passion but emulation or animosity to the more refpecCable orders of the State; without com- initting himself, he had abetted every factious lead- er against them, and feemned to be indifferent to consideration or honours, except so far as they led to power. Cicero and Cato were at this time the principal, or most conspicuous, members of the Senate. The first was possessed of consular rank, great ingenuity, wit, and accomplished talents: the other, pofneffed of great abilities and an in- flexible resolution, embraced the cause of the re- public with the fame ardour that others display- ed in conducing their interests or pursuing their pleasures. He had penetration enough to perceive

c HA p. in Cefar, long before the Senate in general was a-
X.X . larmed, a disposition to vilify the aristocracy, and,
in conjunction with needy and profligate citizens, to make a prey of the republic. Under this ap- prehension, he opposed him with a degree of keen- ness which Cafar endeavoured to represent as a mere personal hatred or animosity to hinmfelf.
The Senators, in general, now aware of their danger from Caesar, were disposed to refiif his ap- plications, whether made for honours or for pub- lic trufl. They, on the present occasion, disputed his pretensions to a triumph; and, while he re- mrained without the city in expectation of this ho- nour, refused, according to the forms of the com- monwealth, to admit him on the lift of candidates for the office of Consul. But the day of election being fixed, Cafar, without helitation, preferred the consulate to the triumph, laid down the en- signs of his late military character, aflumed the gown, and entered the city as a candidate for the Confulfiip '.
The People were at this time divided into a variety of factions. Pompey and Craflus diflrufted each other, and both were jealous of Cafar. Their divisions strengthened the party of the Senate, and furnifled that body with the means of thwarting separately many of their ambitious deligns. This Caesar had long perceived, and had paid his court- both to Pompey and to Crafius, in order to hinder their joining the Senate againit him. The expe-
dience I Sueton. in Cefarre, c. iS. Dio. lih, xxxv.i. c. 54.
dience of this precaution now appeared more clear- c H A 1. ly than ever, and he is supposed to have separate- xx. ly represented to these rivals the advantage which their enemies derived from their misunderstand- ing, and the ease with which, if united, they might concert among themselves all the affairs of the re- public, gratify every friend, and disappoint every enemy. Upon this representation, Pompey and Crafi'us were reconciled, and agreed to at in con- cert with Cefar, and in particular to support him in his pretensions at the approaching elecions '.
This private combination, which remained some time a secret, was afterwards, by a kind of mock- ery, called the Triumvirate, alluding to the de- fignation by which certain collegiate offices were known, derived from the numbers which were joined in the commission l. In the mean time, there leaders of supposed opposite fations, in abat- ing their violence against one another, took a fa- vourable aspet of moderation and candour. They paid their court separately to persons whom they wviihed to gain, and flattered them with hopes of being able to heal the divisions of their country. This fort of court they paid in particular to Ci- cero; and by their flatteries, and real or pretend- ed admiration of his talents, seem to have got entire possession of his mind. Pompey affected to place the merits of Cicero greatly above his own.

a. ," .but this man has prcferved it ." At this time
it appeaied that Ciccro, though a fine genius, was but a weak man. The Senators, with whom he had hitherto acted, were alarmed: Atticus, it seems, had taxed him with leaving his party, to commit himself into the hands of their enemies. In his anifwer to this imputation, he seems to have flattered himself that he had made an acquisition of Pompcy, not surrendered himself into his power; at leait, that he had reclaimed or diverted him from the dangerous projects in which he had been lately engaged, and that he thought himself like- ly to succeed in the fame manner with Cafar: 'b' much, that he triumphed in the- superiority of his own conduct to that of Cato, whp, by his au- iterity and vehemence, he said, had alienated the minds of men otherwise well dispose4 to the re- public W, " While I," he laid, " by a little dif- " cretion, disarm, or even reclaim its enemies 3."
Few persons, where his vanity did not blind him, were poffeifed of more penetration than Ci- cero; but it will afterwards appear how egregi- oufly he was mistaken on this occasion; he chose not to fee what checked his vain glory, or pre- vented his enjoying the court which was paid to

His own importance, for the most part, intercep- '. ted every other objeCt from his view, and made him the dupe of every person who professed to admire him, and incapable of any serious regard for any one who did not pay him, on every oc- cafion, the expected tribute of praise; a defcrip- tion under which Cato, though his most sincere well-wisher and friend, appears at this time to have fallen.
Caesar, to the other arts which he employed to secure his election, added the use of money, which he obtained by joining his interest, in opposition to Bibulus, with that of Lucceius, another of the candidates possessed of great wealth. He himself having squandered his fortune, as has been ob- served, was still greatly in debt, and Lucceius willingly furnified the money that was given to the People in the name of both. This illegal proceeding, together with the menacing concerts of which he began to be fufpeded with Pompey and Crassus, greatly alarmed the friends of the republic. They determined to support Bibulus against Lucceius; and, in order to give Cafar a colleague who might occasionally oppose his dan- gerous intentions, they even went so far as to contribute fums of money, and to bid for votes as high as their opponents. In this crisis, it is said, that even Cato owned it was meritorious to bribe '.

c H A P. During the dependence of this contei, the Se- t-.-v. nate, by the death of Lutatius Catulus, was depri-
ved of an able member, and the People of a fel- low-citizen of great integrity, moderation, forti- tude, and ability; a model of what the RomanS in this age should have been, in order to have preserved the State. He partook with Cato in the aversion which Cefar bore to the most refpec- table members and best supports of the Senate, and would probably have taken part with him likewise in the continual efforts he made to maintain its au- thority. The arifocratical party, notwithstanding this loss, prevailed in carrying the election of Bi- bulus against Lucceius; and though they could not exclude Cefar from the office of Consul, they hoped, by means of his colleague, to oppose and to frustrate his designs I.
Ceiar, well aware of their purpose, opened his adminiftlration with a speech in praise of unanimity, and recommending good agreement between those who were joined in any public truit. While he meant to vilify the Senate, and to softer every dif- orderly party against them, he guarded his own behaviour, at least in the first period of his Con- fulihip, with every appearance of moderation and candour, paid his court not only to leaders of sac- tion, but to persons of every condition; and while he tookl care to espouse the popular fide in every question, was adcive likewise in devising regula- tions for the better government of the Empire: so

that the Senate, however inclined to counteract CHAP. his designs, as calculated to raise himfelfon the XIX. ruins of the commonwealth, could scarcely, with a good grace, oppose him in any particular mea- sure. He set out with a project for the relief of such indigent citizens as had numerous families, including the veterans and disbanded soldiers of Pompey; these he proposed to fettle on some of the public lands il Italy. He gave out that he ex- peaed the concurrence of Cicero in this measure, sent him a menfage by Balbus , with assurances that he meant to consult with Pompey and himself in all matters of'importance, and that he bad hopes of briiging Crojfits also into the fame mind: words, from which it is manifest that the coalition of these persons was not yet publicly known. " What
," a fine profpea I have before me," fays Cicero to Atticus; " a perfec union with Pompey, even " with Cafar if I please; peace with my enemies, 4' and tranquility in my old age." But his heart soon after mifgave him; the honours of his for- mer life recurred to his mind. With his eminent talents, he was destined to transmit a more honest fame to posterity, and to become the lamented vicim of his country's betrayers, not the deteftate associate of their crimes 2
This Consulate is distinguished by the passing of many laws, particularly this, which was devised for the settlement of citizens on certain parts of the pu-

an Agrarian Law. On this act Cafar was to reft his popularity, and his triumph over the Senate. He gave out that he was to make a provision for twenty thousand citizens, without any burden to the revenue. But he well knew that his antago- nilts would perceive the tendency of the measure, or not susser it to pass without opposition; and he affected great moderation in the general purpose, and in framing every part of his plan; affecting iblicitude to obtain the content of the Senate; but, in reality, to make their opposition appear the more unreasonable and the more odious to the People. He declared, that he did not mean to firip the revenue of any branch that was known to carry profit to the public, nor to make any par- tial distribution in favour of his friends; that he only meant to plant with inhabitants certain un- profitable waftes, and to provide for a number of citizens, who, being indigent and uneasy in their circumitances, filled the city itself with frequent disorders and tumults; and that he would not pro- ceed a Rsep without consulting the Senate, and every perfori of credit and authority in the State.
In a way to save there appearances, and with these professions, CaSfar formed the first draught of an adt which he brought to the Senate for their approbation, and in hopes to obtain their support in proposing it to the People. It was difficult to find topics on which to oppose a measure so plau- fible, and conduted with so much appearance of
moderation
moderation and candour. But the tendency of the c H A P. as itself was evidently not to promote the peace - of the commonwealth, but to constitute a merit in the person who procured it, and to confer high measures of power on those who were to be in- trusted with its execution.
In great and populous cities indigent citizens are ever likely to be numerous, and would be more so, if the idle and profligate were taught to hope for bounties and gratuitous provisions, to quiet their clamours and to suppress their difor- ders. If men were to have estates in the country because they are fatious and turbulent in the city, it is evident that public lands, and all the refour- ces of the molt prosperous (late, would not be sufficient to supply their wants. Commissioners appointed for the distribution of such public fa- vours would be raised above the ordinary ma. giltrates, and above the laws of their country. They might reward their own creatures, and keep the citizens in general in a state of depen- dence on their will. The authors of such pro- pofals, while they were urging the State and the people to ruin, would be confidered as their only patrons and friends. " It is not this law I dread," said Cato; "it is the reward expected for obtain- " ing it."
Odious as the talk of opposition on such diffi- cult ground might appear to the People, this Se- nator did not decline it. Being asked his opinion in his turn, he answered, lThat he saw no occasion
for
c H A p. for the change that was now proposed in the state - 'T of the public domains; and entered on an argument
with which he meant so to exhaust the whole time of the fitting, as to prevent the Senate from co- ming to a question. He was entitled, by his pri- vilege as a member in that assembly, to speak with- out interruption, and might, if he chose to conti- nue speaking, persist until all the members had left the house. Cafar fufpefting his design, and fin(;ng it impoflible otherwise to lilence him, or- dem;d him into custody. The whole Senate in- itantly rose in a tumult. " Whither go you be- " fore the meeting is adjourned ?" said Caesar to Petreius, who was moving from his tide. " I go," said the other, " into confinement with Cato. (' With him a prison is preferable to a place in (' the Senate with you." The greater part of'the members were actually moving away with Cato, and Caef:r felt himself at once stript of the dif- guise of moderation he had assumed, and dreaded the spirit which he saw rising in to numerous a body of men, who, on former occasions, had main- tained their authority with a vigour too fatal to those who opposed it. He had relied on their want of decision, and on their ignorance of their own strength. But his rashness broke the charm. He wished that the prisoner would procure some friend among the Tribunes to interpose; but Ca- to, fceing him embarrassed, and the Senate enga- ged in the cause, went off in the custody of the LiACor w ithout any signs of reluctance. Cafar
immediately
immediately recolleting himself, and never hur- cHA P. ried too far by any passion, dispatched a Tribune x . of his own party with secret directions to rescue the prisoner; and this being done, the Senators again returned to their places. " I meant," said Caesar, " to have submitted this law to your judg- " ment and correction; but if you throw it aside, "the People ihall take it up '."
Caesar, upon this occasion, increased his own popularity, and diminished that of his enemies in the Senate, who were supposed in this, as in some other instances, to withfland with keenness every measure that was devised for the comfort of the People. The imputations cast out against him by Cato and others, were supposed to proceed from malice or cynical prejudices. Hc found himself itrong enough to extend his bounty to the People, so as to comprehend the lands of Campania, which were hitherto confidered as unalienable, and the richest demesne of the public, together with a valuable diftrit near the confluence of the Vul- turnus and the Sabbatus, formerly consecrated to pious uses.' In these valuable tracts of land there was sufficient subjec for an ample provision for the soldiers of Pompey, and for the retainers of those who, together with CrafTus and Caesar him- self, were proposed to be commiflioners for carry- ing this law into execution.
At the firit assembly of the People, Cefar .pro- poscd his scheme to impropriate the lands of Cam-

XIX. mJ called on his colleague Bibulus to declare his mind
on the subjed. Bibulus spoke his dissent; and in vehement terms declared, that no such alienation of the public demesne liould be made in his Con- fulate. Caesar next called upon Pompey, though in a private station; and the audience, ignorant of the concert into which these leaders had enter- ed, were impatient to hear this oracle on the sub- jed of a measure which was likely to elevate a supposed rival so high in the favour of the People. To the surprise of all who were present, Pompey applauded the general design, and, in a speech of considerable length, difcufled all the clauses of the ad, and with great approbation of each. When he had done speaking, Cxefar, alluding to what had dropt from his colleague, and affecting to fear the interposition of force; " Will you support us," he said to Pompey, " in cafe we are attacked ?"- "If any one," said the other, " shall lift up a " sword against you, I shall lift up both sword " and fllield.'." Crassus being called upon, also spoke to the fame effect. The concurrence of all these leaders portended the unanimous consent of all parties; and a day being fixed for finally deciding the quellion, the assembly adjourned.
To oppose a measure so popular, and from which such numbers had great expectations, no means remained so likely to succeed as superstition. To
this I Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. Plutarch. in Pompeio. Din. Cal. lib. xX;xviii. c. 5.
this aid Bibulus accordingly had recourse, and, by c IH AP.
XIX. virtue of the authority with which he was veiled, _-· proclaimed a general fait, and a suspension for the present year of all the affairs of State. The design of this suspension, and the extravagant length of time to which it was extended, probably enabled his colleague to treat it with contempt, and to proceed in the design of putting his question, as if no such proclamation had been issued. The assembly was accordingly summoned in the temple of Concord. Ciefar, early in the morning, secured all the ave- nues and the steps of the portico, where he had Vatinius, ohe. of the Tribunes of the People, who was entirely devoted to his interest, and'even in his pay ', stationed with a party, arid prepared to take the odium of all violent measures on him- self. Bibulus, however, attended by numbers of the Senate, and three of the Tribunes, who were engaged, by their negative, to put a flop to every proceeding, came into the place of assembly, with all the forrs of office, and protested against the legality of any meeting to be held in a time of general fast; but the oppolite party being in posses- lion of the temple, forced him from the fleps, broke the ensigns of the Lidors, wounded the Tribunes who interposed in his defence, and effedually re- moved all farther obftrudion to their own designs.

This oath was probably a snare laid by Caesar for the most resolute of his opponents, like that which had been formerly laid by Marius, on a like occasion, for Metellus Numidicus, and by means of which that virtuous citizen was actually for some time removed from the commonwealth 1.
Metellus Celer, the late Consul, together with Cato and Favonius, unaware of the fiare which was laid for them, at first declared their resolution not to swear to the observance of any such ruin- ous law; but, on farther deliberation, they be- came sensible that in this they were serving the cause of their enemies. " You may have no need "of Rome," said Cicero, now awake from his dream, to Cato, "' and may go into exile with " pleasure; but Rome has need of you. Give " not such a victory to her enemies and your own°" Upon view of the matter, it was determined to comply 2.
Bibulus, on the day following that of his vio- lent expulsion from the assembly of the People, convened the Senate, represented the outrage he had received, and submitted the state of the re- public to their consideration. But even this as- fembly, though confiting of above fix hundred of the most powerful citizens of Rome, not destitute

" They appear," said Cicero upon this oc- cafion, " to think, that even if the republic should " perish, they will be able to preserve their fiih- "ponds."
The Consul Bibulus, even Catoi though far re- moved from any ambiguity of condut;, saw no pof- fibility of withitanding the torrent. The first re- tired to his own house, and from thenceforward during the remainder of his term in office, did.not personally appear in his public character, and even Cato absented himfelf-from the SenateI.
While Cefar engrossed the full exercise of the consular power, Bibulus was content with issuing his edicts or manifestos in writing, containing pro- tests, by which he endeavoured to flop all proceed- ings in public affairs on account of the religious fast, or continuation of holidays, which, according to the forms of the commonwealth, he had infti- tuted to restrain his colleague. In these writings, he published violent invecives against Cafar, in which, among other articles, he charged him with having had a part in the conspiracy of Cataline 2, The Tribune Vatinius, in return, issued a warrant to commit the Consul Bibulus to prison; and, in order to seize his person, attempted to break into

H A P. his house; but in this he was foiled, and the par- ,_'. ties continued, during the remainder of this Con-
fulate, in the fame situation with refpe6t to each other.
In dating the year, initead of the Consulate of Caxfar and Bibulus, it was called by some wag the Consulate of Julius and Cfar '. This able ad- venturer, though fufpeted of the deepcRf designs, went fill deeper in laying his measures for the ex- ecution of them than his keenest opponents sup- posed. He found means to tie up every hand that was likely to be lifted up againfl himself; as those of Pompey and Crafius, by their secret agreement, of which the articles were gradually disclosed in the effect.. le confirmed to Pompey all the ads of his administration in Asia, and, by putting him on the commission for dividing the lands of Cam- pania, and for fettling a colony at Capua, gave him an opportunity, which the other earnestly desired, of providing for many necessitous citizens of his party. He flattered Craftus sufficiently, by pla- cing him on the fame commiflion, and by admit- ting him to a supposed equal participation of that political consequence which the Triumvirs propo- fed to secure by their union. He gained the E- queftrian order, by granting a suit which they had long in dependence, for a diminution of the rents payable by the revenue farmers in Asia T. These he reduced a third and by this at, acquired with
that : Sueton. in C. Cxefare, c. lo. Dio. Caf lib. xxxvii. c. 6. 8. , Cicero ad Att. lib ii. ep. x, Appian. de Bell. Civil lib. ii. p. 43e.
that order of men the character of great liberality e H A P. and candour. He himself was the only person . x'x who, in appearance, was not to profit by these ar- rangements. He was occupied, as his retainers gave out, in serving the republic, and in promot- ing his friends; was the general patron of the distressed and the indigent, and had nothing to propose for himself.
With his content, and under his authority, Fu- fius, one of the Pretors, and Vatinius, one of the Tribunes, obtained two laws, both of them equi- table and salutary: the firit, relating to the use of the ballot in the Comitia, or assembly of the Peo- ple: the other, relating to the challenge of par- ties in the nomination of judges or juries. The introduction of the ballot in political questions had greatly weakened the influence of the aristocracy over the determinations of the People; and refo- lutions were frequently carried in this manner, which no party, nor any particular order of men, were willing to acknowledge as their measure. The Nobles imputed absurd determinations to the majority which was formed by the People, and there in their turn retorted the imputation. To leave no doubt in such matters for the future, Fu- fius proposed, that the separate orders of Patrician, Equestria'n, and Plebeian, ihould ballot apart'. This regulation had some tendency to reRfore the influence of the superior clafIes.

Cafar himself was busy in devising new regula- tions to reform the mode of elections, and to im- prove the forms of business in some of the pub- lic departments. By one of his ads the. priests were to be eleted agreeably to the former laws of Atius and Domitius, with this difference, that can- didates might be admitted even in absence. By another of his ads, regular journals were to be! kept in the Senate and in the assemblies of the People, and all their proceedings recorded for the infpetion of the public. By a third, persons con- vicded of treason were fubjeded to new penalties, and governors of provinces-to additional restraints, in the exercise of their power. Such officers were not allowed to receive any honorary gift from their provinces, until their services being confidered at Rome, were found to have entitled them to a tri- umph }. They were restrained from encroaching on the right of any State or principality beyond the limits of their province. They were obliged to leave copies of their books. and of their ads at two of the principal towns in their government 3, and, immediately upon their arrival at Rome, to give in a copy of the fame accounts to the trea-

fury. They were doomed to make reflitution of c HA P. all fubjets received in extortion, not only by them- XIX. selves, but by any of their attendants .
With these adts Caesar adorned his Consulate, and in tome measure difcountenanced the party which was disposed to traduce him. He is, ne- verthelefs, accused of having stolen from the trea- fury, to which he had access in the capacity of Consul, bars of gold weighing three thousand pondo, and of having concealed the theft by sub- tituting brass gilt, and of the fame form, in its stead 2.
Whatever foundation there may have been for this report, it soon appeared that Caesar had ob- jedts of a more serious nature, could copy, on oc- cafion, the example of Pompey, and, in his man- ner, cause what was personal to himself to be pro- posed by others, whom he might be free to support or difavowv according to the reception which his proposal fllould meet from the public. It cannot be doubted that he now conceived the design of ha- ving a military force, ifneceffary to support his pre. tensions in the city. Hitherto kingly power be- ing odious at Rome, whoever had aspired to it had always perilhed in the attempt, and the mere im- putation, however supported, was fatal.

c r A P. or unwilling to support their demagogues to this
XIX. .XI. extent; and the People in general became jealous
of their most refpedable citizens, when it appear- ed that merit itself approached to monarchical elevation. Marius, by the continued possession of the highest offices, and by the supreme command of armies, had acquired a species of sovereignty which he knew not how to resign. Cinna came into partnership with Marius, and wished to go- vern after his decease. Sylla, to avenge his own wrongs and those of his friends, to cut off a profli- gate faction, and restore the republic, took pof- session of the government. He led his army againfi usurpers, and had the power to become himself the most successful usurper, as he was put in possession of a sovereignty which he no doubt might have retained. So far in him, therefore, every ambi- tious adventurer found a model, and was inftruc- ted in the means which could insure to a tingle person the sovereignty of Rome. Cataline, with his accomplices Lentulus and Cethegus, by means of a profligate party among the populace or citi- zens of desperate fortune, had vainly attempted to overturn the State, or usurp its government 1. Ce- far was become head of the fame party; but an army like that of Sylla, a convenient station, and the resources of a great province, were neceflary to support the contest, and to carry it against his
rivals, x Speaking of the imaginary danger to a State of being overturned by the rabble; wre rr.ight as much fear, said a witty writer of the present age, that h city would be drowned by the overflowing of its own kennels.
rivals, as well as against the republic itself, to any c H A P.
XI. favourable iflle.
The republic had taken many precautions to prevent the introdulion of military power at Rome. Although the functions of State and of war were intrusted to the fame persons, yet the civil and military characters, except in the cafe of a Dictator, were never united at once in the fame person. The officer of State resigned his civil power before he became a soldier, and the soldier was obliged to lay aside his military ensigns and character before he could enter the city; and if he sued for a triumph in his military form, muff remain without the walls till that suit was dif- cuffed. The command of armies and of pro- vinces in the person of any officer was limited to a tingle year at a time, at the end of which, if the commission were not expressly prolonged, it was understood to expire, and to devolve on a fuccef- for named by the Senate.
That no leader of party might have an army at hand to overawe the republic, no military fta- tion was Iuppofed to exist within the limits of Italy. The purpose, however, of this precaution was in some measure frustrated by the situation of a province in which an army was kept with- in the Alps. Italy was understood to extend on. ly from the sea of Tarentum to the Arnus and the Rubicon: beyond these boundaries, on the northwef, all those extensive and rich tracts on both fides of the Apennines, and within the Alps,
D d 4 which
c i A P. which now make the dutchies of Ferrara, Bologna, x- ' Modeno, Milan, the States of Piedmont and Ve-
nice, with the dutchy of Carniola, and the whole of Lombardy, and part of Tuscany, were con- fidered, not as Italy, but as a province termed the Cisalpine Gaul, and, like the other Roman pro- vinces, was to be held by a military officer, sup- ported by an army.
This then was the most commodious flation at which a political adventurer might unite the great- eft advantages, that of having an army at his com- mand, and that of being so near the city of Rome, as not only to influence the public councils, but to be able also, by surprise, to occupy the feats of government whenever his designs were ripe for such an attempt.
Sylla had an army devoted to his pleasure; but, having the seas of Asia and Ionia to pass in his *way to Italy, could not, without giving an alarm from a great distance, and without putting his ene- mies on their guard, approach to the capital. He therefore, when he had this object in view, made no secret of his purpose.
Cxefar, from his native disposition, could not re- train his ambition short of the sovereignty, and without any signal incitement or singular circum- fiances, like those of Sylla, was prepared to obtain it. He arranged his measures like the plan of a cam- paign, which he had ability to digest, and the pa- tience to execute with-the greatest deliberation. He

The Cisalpine Gaul, or that part of Italy which extended from the Rubicon.to the Alps, was thus peculiarly suited to the purpose of Caesar. But the diftribution.of the provinces was fRill within the prerogative of the Senate; and the provincial governments were filled by their nomination, in pursuance of an express regulation afcxibed to Caius Gracchus, and known, from his name, by the title. of the Sempronian Law'. Caesar had ever been at variance with the greater part of the Senate. In the office of Prxtor he had been fu- spended by their authority. In his present office of Consul he had set them at open defiance. He had no profped of being able to obtain from them the choice he had made of a province; and- the proposal to put him in polteffion of the Cisalpine Gaul for a term of years, joined to the preceding parts of his conduc, would have given a general alarm, and opened at once the whole extent of his dlcign.

;CH A . It was necefTary, therefore, in order to obtain ,x. m this object, to set aside the authority of the Senate,
and to procure his nomination by some degree of surprise. The Tribune Vatinius accordingly, upon u rumour that the Helvetii, or the nations inha- biting the tracs or valleys from Mount Jura to the Alps, were likely to cause some commotion on the frontier of Gaul, moved the People to set aside the law of Sempronius, and, by virtue of their own transcendent authority, to name Cafar as Proconsul of the Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years, with an army of three legions. The senatorian party, as might have been expected, were greatly alarmed at this proposal. Theyvainly, however, hoped to evade it by substituting another appointment for Caesar in place of this province. It was proposed to make him fuperintendant of the public forests throughout the empire; a charge which, though not, in our acceptation of the word, a province, was however, like every other public department in that empire, known by this name. This substitute for the government of the Cisalpine Gaul was thought to be the better chosen, that it neither implied nor required the command of an army, and was to withhold the engine of military power from a person so likely to abuse it. This weak attempt, however, against so able an adversary, only tended to expose the meaning of those by whom it was made, and by shewing to the Senate their own weakness, hurried them into concessions which perhaps might have been other-

wife avoided. In order that Csefar might not owe c H A P. every thing to the People and nothing to them, Ix. they extended his command at once to both fides of the Alps. On the one fide of these mountains he had a station from which to overawe the city: on the other, he had a great extent of territory, and a theatre of war on which he might form an army and inure them to service. The Senate, feeing he had already, by a vote of the People, obtained the first with an army of three legions for five years; and imagining that it was no lon- ger of any use to oppose him; or hoping to oc- cupy his attention, or to wear out the five years of his command in wars that might arise beyond the Alps, they joined to his province on the Po that of the Transalpine Gaul also, with an addi- tional legion. In this manner, whether from there or any similar motives, it is affirmed by some of the historians ', that the Senate even outran the People in concessions to Cafar; and to this occa- sion is referred the memorable faying of Cato " Now you have taken to yourselves a king, and " have placed him with his guards in your Ci- " tadel ."
Caesar, at the fame time, on the motion of the Tribune Vatinius, was empowered to fettle a Ro- man colony on the Lake Larius at Novum Co- mum, with full authority to confer the privilege

C H A P. of Roman citizens on those he ihould fettle in this x x place. Having obtained the great object of his
Consulate, in his appointment for a term of years to the command of an army within the Alps, he no longer kept any measures with the Senate, nor allowed them any merit in the advantages he had gained. He was aware of their malice, he said, and had prevailed in every suit, not by their con- cession, but in direct opposition to their will, Though capable of great command of temper, and of the deepest dissimulation when in pursuit of his objec, he appears, on this and other occasions to have had a vanity which he idly indulged, in braving the world when his end was obtained 1. As he insulted the Senate when no longer depend- ing on their consent for any of his objects, so he no longer disguised his conned ion with Pompey and Craflus, or the means by which, in his late measures, the concurrence of there rivals had been obtained.

As such combinations and cabals generally have an invidious aspect to those who are excluded from them, the Triumvirate, for so it began to be cal- led in detetfation and irony 2, notwithifanding the popularity or influence enjoyed by those who had formed it, became an objcc2 of aversion and gene- ral abuse 3.

The edidts that were published by Bibulus in opposition to Csefar were extolled, and received with avidity. The places of the fireets at which they were pofled up were so crowded with mul- titudes assembled to read them, that the ways were obftruated. Caesar and Pompey endeavoured to lessen the effe& of there edicts in speeches to the People, but were ill heard. Pompey loft his tem- per and his spirit, and funk in his consideration as much as Caesar advanced in power. It became manifest, even to the People, that Caesar was the only gainer by this coalition, that he had procured it for his own conveniency 2; but Pompey him- self probably felt that he was too far advanced to recede.
The Senate, and all the most refpetable citi- zens of Rome, though unanimous in their detefta- tion of the design that was formed by Caesar, Pom- pey, and Crassus, to dispose of the republic at their pleasure, yet either were, or believed themselves,
unable i " To our misfortune thou art great." He was called upon to repeat these' words again and again innumerable times. " The time will come ' when thou flalt rue this State ;" likewise repeated with peals of applause, P-c. Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. epift. 19. Val. Max. lib. vi. c. 2.

XIX, united. Cefar, in order to hold by force what he
gained by artifice, and by some degree of surprise, filled the streets with his retainers in arms, and showed, that, in cafe of any attempt to recal what had been so weakly given up to him, he was in condition to reift, and to lay the city in blood. If he were driven from Rome, he had provided within the Alps an army of two or three complete legions, with which he could maintain his pro- vince, or even recover his poieffion of the city. Every one censured, complained and lamented; but there was little concert, and less vigour, even among the members of the Senate.
Cato, with his declared disapprobation of the late measures, was reduced to the iingle expedient of assisting Bibulus in drawing up the edits or ma. nifeflos against. the proceedings of Caesar, which, as has been mentioned, were at this time receiv- ed with so much avidity by the People.
Cicero now declined taking part in any affair of State; but being known for an advocate of the greatest ability, was courted in this capacity by many citizens, who had affairs in dependence be- fore the courts of justice; but apprehending an attack which was likely to be made upon himself, on account of the tranfa&ions of his Consulate, he avoided, as much as possible, giving offence to any of the parties which divided the commonwealth. The florm was to be direced against him by Pub- lius Clodius, under whose animosity to the govern-
ment
rment of the Nobles, and to Cicero in particular, CHAP. it was perceived for some time to be gathering'. XX.
This bustling profligate having, in the former year, in order that he might be qualified for Tri- bune of the People, got himself adopted into a Plebeian family, could not obtain the necefiary ratification of the deed of adoption in the assembly of the Curiae, until his cause was espoused by Ca:- far, who seems to have taken his part, in resent. ment of some insinuations thrown out against him. self by Cicero in pleading for M. Antonius, his late colleague in the Consulate. Antonius being, as has been mentioned, on account of his admini- ftration in Macedonia, accused of extortion, was defended by Cicero, who took that occasion to la- ment the state of the republiC, brought under sub- jedion as it was by a cabal which ruled by vio- lence, and in contempt of the laws. Caesar was greatly provoked at these expressions: " This per- ' son," he said, " takes the fame liberty to vilify ~' the reputation of others, that he takes to extol " his own;" and confidering this speech as a warn- ing of the part which Cicero was likely to take in his absence, he determined not to leave him at the head of the Senatorian party to operate against him. His defiru&ion might be effeaed merely by expediting the formality of Clodius's adoption in- to a Plebeian family, to qualify him for Tribune of the People '; and Cxaer, on the very day in

Clodius, in the mean time, gave out, that he had no design on the Tribunate, but was.foli. citing' an embassy to Tigtanes. king of Armenia. Cicero was so much blinded by this pretence, that he was merry in. his letter to Atticus on the ab- furdity of Clodius, in having himself degraded in- to a Plebeian, merely to. qualify him to appear at the court of Tigranes. He was merry likewise with his not being put on the commiflion of twenty for the execution of Cefar's Agrarian Law. " Strange !" he said, " that he who was once the
only male creature in Cefar's house, cannot now "find one place among twenty in the lift of his " friends I."
The more effectually to impose upon Cicero and his friends, Caesar affected to believe, that the in- tention of Clodius was against himself, and taken up with the animosity of a person who had al- ready attempted to dishonour his house a; and he pretended to dispute the validity of his adoption, and of consequence, his qualification to be elected a Tribune. Pompey joined also in the fame vile artifice. " Nay," fays Cicero, upon hearing of
"their I Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. epift. 7. 2 In the intrigue with Cefar's wife.
their pretended opposition to Clodius, "this is CH AP. ' vexation merely. Send but the proper officers to xx. "me, and I will make oath, that Pompey told me "himself he had aflifced as Augur in passing that " decree '.
With these tranfaaions the year of Cafar's Cori- fulate drew to a close. He ratified his treaty with Pompey, by giving him his daughter Julia in mar- riage. During the former part of the year, this lady had been promised to Setvilius Caepio, and had been of gteat use to her father, by securing the services of Caepio againht Bibulus. But now it was found more expedient to attach Pompey, and Servilius, on his disappointment, was pacified by tie promise of Pompey's daughter. Cafar himself married the daughter of Calpurnius Pifo, who, together with Gabinius, the creature of Pom- pey, was deflined to succeed in the Consulate, and who was, by this alliance, secured in the interest of Caesar. " Provinces, armies, and kingdoms," said Cato on this occasion, " are made the dowries " of women ', and the empire itself an appendage " of female prostitution."
In this situation of affairs, and among parties who dealt in impositions and artifices, as well as in open and daring measures, some particulars are re- corded, which, to gain our belief, require some ac- quaintance with the intrigues of popular facion. Yettius, a citizen of some note, who had been em-

C H A P. ployed by Cicero in the time of his Confulihip to'
XLX. ^S \_gain intelligence of the Cataline conspiracy, now
himself appeared as the author of a plot, of which the origin and the issue were matter of various conjecture. Knowing that Curio, a young man of high rank, and a declared enemy of Caesar, was on bad terms likewise with Pompey, Vettius told him in confidence, that he himself had determined to assassinate Pompey, and proposed to Curio to join with him in that design. The young man com- municated the matter to his father, and the father to Pompey, who laid it before the Senate. Vet- tius being examined in the Senate, at first denied any intercourse with Curio, but afterwards con- sessed, that he had been drawn into a conspiracy in which this young man, was concerned with Lu- cullus, Brutus, Bibulus, and rome others, who had formed a design on Pompey's life.
It was fufpeted, that Cafsar had employed Vet- tius to pretend this design against Pompey, and by opening himself to these persons to engage some of them in a concert with himself; and that it was intended, as foorl as he had laid some founda- tion for an imputation of guilt against any of them, that he should, attended by a party of slaves, armed with daggers, put himself in the way of being ta- ken; that he should at first deny the plot, but after- wards susser himself to be forced, by degrees, to confess, and to declare his accomplices; but that this plan was difconderted by the early intimation which Curio gave to his father, before all the cir-
cumftances
cumftances projected to give it an air of probabi- c A A P. lity were in readiness. xIX.
It cas scarcely credible, however, that Cefar lhould have committed his reputation to the ha- zard of detecion in so infamous a project. He laid hold of it indeed with some avidity, and en- deavoured to turn it against his opponents. After Vettius had been examined before the Senate, and was committed to prison for farther examination, Cafar presented him to the People, and brought him into the rofira, to declare what he knew of this pretended most bloody design. The prisoner repeated his confession, but varied in the account of his accomplices, particularly in leaving Brutus out of the lift; a circumfiance likewise, in the scandal of the times, imputed to the partiality of Caesar, and confidered as proof of his clandefline relation to this young man. Vettius was remanded to prison, and a process commenced against him on the flatute of intended assassination. A trial muff have probably disclosed the whole scene, and for this reason was said to have been prevented, by the sudden death of Vettius, who was fippofed to have been strangled, by order of Cafar, in prison'.
By the influence of Pompey and Caesar, Gabi- u. c. 6pg. nius and Pifo were eleted Consuls; and, by their nius pi'o connivance, Clodius became Tribune of the People. Cefonnus, The ascendant they had gained, however, was ex- 4P0,- tremely disagreeable to many of the other officers of State, and even to some of the Tribunes. L.

lus, joined in a prosecution against Caesar, late Con- ful, for proceedings in office contrary to law and religion. Cefar, for some time, affected to join issue with them on the questions proposed, and to submit his cause to judgment; but at last, appre- hending delay and trouble, without any advantage from such an inquiry, he pleaded his privilege as a person destined for public service; and ac- cordingly, without flaying to answer the charge which was laid against him, withdrew from the city, continued to make his levies, and to afiemble an army in the suburbs of Rome. In this posture of affairs, one of the Quaestors, who had served under Caesar in his Consulship, was conviced of some misdemeanor 1; and the opposite party, as if they had of a sudden broke the chains in which they were held, commenced suits againit all the tools that had been employed by him in his late violent measures. Gabinius had been charged with bribery by Caius Cato, then a young man. But the Praetor, whose lot it was to exercise the jurifdic'ion in such cafes, being under the influence of Pompey, evaded the q.uestion. Caius Cato com- plained to the People, and, in stating the cafe, ha- ving said that Pompey usurped a Dicdatorial power, so far incensed part of his audience, that he nar- rowly escaped with his life '.
Vatinius, the late mercenary Tribnne, was ac- cufed before the Praetor Memmius, who willing-
ly i Sueton. in Nerone, c. ii. et in Cxefare, c, 73. I Cicero ad Quint, Frat. lib. i. epit, 2.
ly received the accusation; but all proceedings in c HA P. the matter were suddenly flopped by the interpo- , sition of Clodius in his new situation; and the at- tention of the People and of the Senate soon as- terwards came to be more intensely occupied with the designs of this factious Tribune himself, than with any other business whatever.
The ruin of Cicero appears to have been the prin- cipal objec which Clodius proposed to himself in soliciting the office which he now held; and this, though affecting to be of the popular party, he pursued chiefly from motives of personal animofi- ty and resentment. Cicero had given evidence against him on his late trial, and afterwards in the Senate made him the objet of his wit and invecive 1. He is generally represented as effe- minate and profligate, void of discretion or pru- dence. On the present occasion, however, he seems to have managed with considerable fteadi- ness and address. He aated evidently in concert with Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus; but probably had not from them any particular direction in what manner he was to proceed.
Ever since the summary proceedings which were employed against the accomplices of Cataline, the danger of this precedent was a favourite topic with the popular faction. Clodius profefled that the whole object of his Tribunate was to provide a guard against such dangers for the future. He began with paying his court to the different par-
Ee 3 ties : Cicer. ad Att. lib. x,
c H A P. ties and different orders of men in the republic, by ax proposing such ads as were favourable to each; and
he itated his motion for better securing the People againit arbitrary executions, without any applica- tion to Cicero, as but one of many regulations in- tended by him for the benefit of the public, and which he joined with some acs of gratification to private persons. He gained the present Consuls by procuring them lucrative appointments, at the expiration of their year in office; to Pifo, Mace- donia including Achaia; to Gabinius, Syria with a considerable addition beyond the usual bounds of that province . He gained the indigent part of the People by an ad to remit all the debts which were due for corn at the public granaries; and by ordering, for the future, gratuitous diftri- butions to be made from thence2. He, at the fame time, procured another at extremely agree- able to many of the citizens, for restoring and in- creasing the number of incorporated Societies, which had been abolished about nine years before, on ac- count of the troubles to which they gave rife.
The operation of corporate bodies, in a city so much addided to fadion and tumult, had been the cause of frequent disorders. As persons, asseting to govern the State, endeavoured 'to gain the People by indulging their humour in idleness and diffipa- tion, with games, theatrical entertainments, com- bats of gladiators, and the baiting of wild beasts;
so 1 Plutarch. in Cicerone. 2 Padianus in Pifoniana. Dio. lib. xxxviii. Cicer. pro Domo fua,
so the head of every corporate body, though upon c i A r. a smaller tcale, had his feasts, his entertainments, M . and shews, forming to himself a party of retainers, on occasion, to be employed as his facion might require. The renewal, therefore, of such efta- blifhmcnts, a mreafure which carried to every am- bitious tradefnman in his flall the feeling and con- sequence of a Crassus, a Pompey, or a Cafar, as- feding to govern the world in their refpetive ways, was greedily adopted by the lower People. And Clodius took occasion, in the first ardour of fuchcorporate meetings, to foment and to dired their zeal to his own purpose . He even gained a considerable party in the Senate, by affecting to circumscribe the discretionary power of the Cen- fors in purging their rolls. Many of the mem- bers had reason to dread the Censorial anmmadver- lions, and were pleased with an ad which this Tribune obtained to provide, that, for the future, no one could be ffruck off the lift of the Senate without a formal trial, and the concurrence of both the Censors ".
Joined to so many arts pradtifed to reconcile dif- ferent parties to the mcafures he affecded to take for the security of the People, Clodius promulga- ted his law of provision againif arbitrary execu- tions, and gave it a retrofped, which was undoubt- edly meant to comprehend the uirlmary proceed- ings which had been held against Cethegus and

H A P. Lentulus, in the Consulate of Cicero. While the x - subjed was under consideration, he thought of two
circumitanccs which might operate againit his de- sign, and which he was therefore determined to pre- vent. One was, the practice of recurring to the celestial auspices, by which the proceedings of the People were sometimes suspended; and the other was, the opposition which he might expet from Marcus Cato, who was likely to confider the cause of the Senate and the republic as involved in that of the magistrate, who had preserved the State by executing their decrees. To secure himself against the firit, he procured an ediA to prohibit all per- sons from observing the heavens while the People were deliberating on any affair of State; and to obviate the second, he thought of a pretence for a temporary removal of Cato from Rome.
In the preceding Consulate, Cato, though arm- ed as he was solely with the reputation of inte- grity, unable to prevent the progress of a ruinous faction affecting popular measures, yet, by his unre- mitted opposition, he had forced them, on occasion, to show what Pompey in particular was extremely desirous to conceal, that they prevailed by corrup- tion and force, not by what they pretended, the free choice of their fellow-citizens. Clodius, foresee. ing if Cato remained at Rome, a like opposition, and possibly a disappointment in his design againa Cicero, devised a commission to employ him in so- reign service. Ptolomy, king of Cyprus, had put a personal affront on Clodius, by refusing to pay
'his
his ransom when taken by pirates on the coast of c H A P. Asia near to that island. But now, in the wretched x.vX Condition of nations, depending on the will of a single profligate citizen, he took an opportunity to be revenged on this prince, by procuring an aa to forfeit his kingdom and his treasure; and by making Cato the instrument of his revenge, he pro- posed to free himself at the fame time from the in- terruption which this citizen was likely to give to his projeCts in the city .
At an interview with Cato, Clodius had the im- pudence to pretend great admiration of his virtue; told him, that the commiflion to reduce Cyprus into the form of a province was solicited by ma- ny; but that he knew of none who, by his faith- fulness and integrity, was so well qualified for the trust as Cato, and that he meant to propose him to the People. " That," said Cato, " I know is a " mere artifice; not an honour, but an indignity ( intended to me." " Nay," said Clodius, " if " you do not go willingly, you shall go by force ;" and on that very day moved and obtained his no- mination from the People. Left the affair of Cy- prus ihould not detain him a sufficient time, he was farther charged in his commission to repair to Byzantium, to restore some exiles, and to quiet some troubles which had arisen in that place.
Cafar and Pompey likewise concurred in pro- curing this commission to Cato, in order to remove a powerful support from the Praetors Memmius
and ; Cicero pro Sextio.
c H A P. and Domitius, whose proposal to repeal all the adC --X.- of Caesar was yet in suspense.
The storm was now ready to burit upon the magiffrate who had presided in the suppression of Cataline's faction, and no man had any doubt of its dire&ion. Cato, before he left Rome, feeing Caesar in possession of the gates with an army, and ready, in the event of any tumult, under pretence of repressing disorders, to enter the city by force, and to seize on the government; or apprehending, that the cause in queflion, however just, was al- together desperate, earnestly exhorted Cicero, ra- ther to yield and to withdraw from the city, than to bring matters to extremities in the present slate of the republic T.
Cicero, however, was for omne time undecided. Having secured the support of L. Ninius Quadra- tus, one of the Tribunes, he proposed to obftrua the proceedings of his enemy, by opposing the negative of a colleague, to all his motions. After- wards, upon afurances from Clodius, that the pur- pose of the aa was altogether general, and had no special relation to himself; he was prevailed on not to divide the college of Tribunes, nor to en- gage his friends in the invidious task of giving the negative to a law, which was intended merely to guard the People for the future against arbitra- ry proceedings 2.
But Clodius, having thus made way for the de- claratory at, which he had drawn up in general
terms, I Plutarch. in Catone. T Dio. lib. xxxviii, c. I4.
terms, no longer made any secret of his design- a- c H A P. gainft the magistrate, who had dared to order the X execution of Lentulus and Cethegus, and boasted of the concurrence of Cafar and Pompey. In this neither of these professed friends of Cicero denied the imputation ; but excused themselves in private by pleading, that while their own acts of the preceding year were fill quefioned by the Praetor, it was necessary for them to keep terms with so violent a tribune as Clodius2; and Pom- pey, together with this apology for his prefeni conduct, gave Cicero the strongest assurances of future protection. " This Tribune," he said, ,' ihall kill me before he injure you." It is not credible that Pompey then meant to betray a per- son for whom he professed so much friendfiip; it was sufficiently base that, in the sequel, he did not perform his promise. On the contrary, when his aid came to be most wanted by his injured friend, he retired to the country, under pretence of business ; and being at his villa near Alba, where Lentulus, Lucullus, and many of the most refpedable Sena- tors repaired to him with the warmest intreaties in behalf of a person to whose eloquence and panegy- ric he owed so many of his honours, he coldly re- ferred them to the ordinary officers ofState for protection, faying, That as a private citizen he could not contend with a furiousTribune at the head of an armed People .>.

CH A P. In the mean time, the Consul Gabinius, though
xix.
under the absolute diretion of Pompey, promoted the attack againit Cicero, and checked every at- tempt that was made in his favour. When the Equefirian order, together with numbers of the muoiL iipedable citizens from every quarter of Italy, crowded in mourning to Rome, and present- ed a memorial to the Senate in his behalf; and when the members of the Senate itfeli proposed to take mourning, and to intercede with the Peo- .ple, Gabmius suddenly left the chair, broke up the meeting, went directly from thence to the assembly of the People, where he threw out injurious infi- nuations against the Senate, and mentioned the meetings which had been held by the Equestrian order, as bordering on sedition and riot; said, that the Knights ought to be cautious how they revi- ved the memory of that part which they them- selves had acted in the violent measures which were now coming under review, and which were so likely to meet with a just retribution from the People of Rome.
In this extremity Cicero attempted to fee Pom- pey in person at his country house; but while the suppliant was entering at one door, this treach- erous friend withdrew at another'. No longer doubting that he was betrayed by a person on whom he had so fully relied, he began to be agi- tated by a variety of counsels and projects. He was invited by Caesar to place himself in the fla-
tion Plutarch. in Cicerone.
tion of lieutenant in his province of Gaul; and, in c H AP that public charader abroad, to take refuge from XIX. the fiorm that was gathering against him in Italy. But this, from a person who had so much contri- buted to raise the storm, was supposed to proceed from a design to insult or betray him; or at best to reduce him to a fate of dependence on himself. Being attended by a numerous body of citizens, chiefly of the Equestrian order, who had taken arms in his cause, he Sometimes had thoughts of defending himself by force; at other times, he funk in despair, and, as appears from his letters, proposed to die by his own hands; an intention from which he was diverted only by the entreaties and anxious care of his friends.
Such was the state of affairs, when Clodius as- fembled the People to pass the act he had framed againfi arbitrary executions. He had summoned them to meet in the suburbs, that Cafar, who on account of his military command was then exclu- ded from the city, might be present. This artful politician being called upon among the first to de- liver his opinion, with an appearance of modera- tion, and unwillingness to bear hard on any per- son to whom the law might apply, referred the People to his former declarations ; said, that every one knew his mind on the subject of arbitrary ex- ecutions; that he certainly approved the ad which was now proposed, as far as it provided against such offences for the future; but could not concur
in
c H A P. in giving it a retrofpet to any tranfaaion already
X.L- passed.
While Caesar thus, in delivering his own opinion, asseted to go no farther than consistency and a regard to his former conduct seemed to require, he permitted or direced his party to go every length with Clodius, and meant either to ruin Ci- cero, or force him to accept of protection on the terms that should be prescribed to him.
When the general law had passed, there was yet no mention of Cicero; and his enemies might have still found it a difficult matter to carry the appli- cation to him; but he himself, in the anguish of his mind, anticipated the consequence, went forth in mourning to the treets, and implored mercy of every citizen with an aspet of despondency, which probably did not encourage any party to espouse his cause. He was frequently met in this condi- tion, and insulted by Clodius, who walked in the fireets, attended by an armed rabble; and deter- mined at last to abandon the city. Being escorted by a company of his friends, he passed through the gates in the middle of the night on the first of April, took the road of Lucania, and intended to have made his retreat into Sicily, where he flatter- ed himself the memory of his adininiftration in the quality of Quaestor, and the subsequent effects of his patronage at Rome, were likely to procure him a favourable reception '. But Clodius, im- mediately upon his departure, having carried a
special i Vid. Actionem in Verrcm.
special attainder, by which, in the language of c H A P. such ads, he was interdiced the use of fire and a , .. water; and by which every person within five hundred miles of Italy was forbid, under severe penalties, to harbour him; Virgilius, the Prator of Sicily, though his friend, declined to receive him. He turned from thence to Brundisium, pas- fed into Macedonia, and would have fixed his re- fidence at Athens; but apprehending that this place was within the distance prescribed to him by the aft of banishment, he went to" Thefalonica in his way to Cyzicum. Here he had letters, that gave him intimation of some change in his favour, entertained some profpea of being speedily recal- led, and accordingly determined to wait the issue of these hopes.
We have better means of knowing the frailties of Cicero, than perhaps is safe for the reputation of any one labouring under the ordinary defects of human nature. He was open and undisguised to his friends, and has left an extensive correfpon- dence behind him. Expressions of vanity in £ome passages of his life, and of pusillanimity in others, escape him with uncommon facility. Being at leafs of a querulous and impatient temper, he gave it full scope in his exile, perhaps not more from weakness, than from a design to excite his friends in redoubling their cflorts to have him restored. He knew the value of fortitude as a topic of praise, and might have aspired to it; but would it not, he may have queflioned, in the present infiance,

C H A P. encourage his party to sleep over his wrongs ? In i-w. any other view, his complaints resemble more the
wailings of an infant, or the firains of a tragedy composed to draw tears, than the language of a man supporting the cause of integrity in the midst of unmerited trouble.

From the whole of this correspondence of Ci- c H A P. cero in his exile, wve may collet to what degree Xx the unjust reproaches which he had suffered, the desertion of those on whom he relied for support, the dangers to which he left his family exposed, affected his mind. The consciousness of his in- tegrity, even his vanity forsook him; and his fine genius, no longer displayed in the Forum or in the Senate, or busied in the literary studies which afterwards amused him in a more calamitous time of the republic, now, by exaggerating the distress of his fortunes, preyed upon himself. It appeared from this, and many other scenes of his life, that although he loved virtuous ations, yet his virtue was accompanied with so unfatiable a thirst of the praise to which it entitled him, that his mind was unable to sustain itself without this foreign affirfance; and when the praise to which he aspired for his Consulate was changed into ob- loquy and scorn, he seems to have loft the sense of good or of evil in his own conduct or character; and at Theffalonica, where he fixed the fccne of his exile, funk or rose, even in his own esteem, as he seemed to be valued or neglected at Rome .

THE OCCASION AND PROGRESS OF THE FOLLOWING WORK.

THE Author was called to the profession of moral philosophy in the year 1764; and continued in it twenty years.
When he entered on the duties of this office, he did not set himself at once to compose a course of lectures, to be read to his pupils; and thus to anticipate the labours of his future life: But, conceiving that difcuflion, and even information, might come with more effeel from a person that was making his own highest efforts of disquisition and judgement,' than from one that might be languishing while he read, or repeated a lecture previously comnpofed; he determined, while he beflowed his utmost diligence in itudying the fubjedc, in chufing the order in which it was to be treated, and in preparing himself for every fuccefive Rep he was to make in his course, to have no more in writing than the heads, or flort notes, from which he was to speak; preparing himself however very diligently for every particular day's work.

By this means, except in so far as the particular views of 
his subjeI2 became familiar to him, his last year's labour was nearly as great as the first.

In proportion as his notes acquired a certain form, he had 
them printed for the use of his students; first under different titles; but, at last, under the title of lncfitutes of Moral Philosophy: He nevertheless experienced, that the course he was to follow, even when so fixed, was fubjeEt to some variations; and, as there appeared to be improvements, and served to enliven his own task with some accessions of novelty, he did not attempt to check or restrain them.

When his health obliged him to retire from the labours 
of teaching, he was glad to find that even the decline of life might be employed, though not in attempting the invention of entire new systems, at least in recalling labours that were pas, and in filling up general titles already inveftigated with some of his customary discussion and illustration.

In performing this work, however, he has indulged the 
fame, or perhaps greater freedoms than he was wont to take in renewing his course of disquisition and argument, from year to year. He conceived that what is intended for a book submitted to public inspection, might require the suppreflion of some things not improper in the firfi introduction 
of 

of youth to the study of a fubje&. He has therefore omitted some titles that were entered in his notes and in the Inftitutes. And he has treated the history of the species in a different manner; not without hopes that this his last method, in the order of progression may have gained some advantage over the former; and that the public will impute defets in the execution of his work to circumstances in which he has reason to hope for all the effeels of candour and even of indulgence.

It maybe asked, perhaps, why he should reflria: his argument, as he has done, to the topics of mere natural religion and reason. This, being the foundation of every superftrucure whether in morality or religion, and therefore, to be separately treated, he confidered as that part of the work which was allotted to him. Farther inflitutions mayimprove,
but cannot supersede what the Almighty has revealed in his works, and in the fuggefiions of reason to man.

tWhen sirs we from the teeming womb were brought,
Wtith inborn precepts, then, ourfouls werefraught.

confidered * Dixitque fcmcl naftcntibus ;aulor 
Q.cq"ilid scire licet,

confidered as the test of every subsequent institution that is offered as coming from him.

Many, no doubt, may be conscious, that in a continued 
pursuit of the fame fubjeac for so long a time, they themselves could have done better; butt in this, it is to be regretted only, that they have not done so: For in this field, there is room for many labourers; and the subje&t, though never new, is always interesting: It is so in the specimen of every particular life; in the hiflory of every particular age or nation, and even in the lucubrations of every faithful tranfcriber of what nature suggests.

Although, therefore, an author may have been preceded 
by men of diftinguifled ability in former, or in the present times; it implies no degree of arrogance to follow, even such reapers, in gleaning materials from this inexhaustible field of reflection, on which mankind have been employed from the beginning, and on which they will continue to be employed to the end of time. The most industrious may be glad if any one think his labours are useful; and no way furprized, if many should think that they might have been spared.

MORAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCE.

I N T R O D U C T I 0 N.
MOST fubjeds in nature may be confidered under two as- INTROD.

peds; under that of their adual state, and under that of /'Y
a specific excellence, or defect, of which they are susceptible.

Under the firif, they are fubjeds of mere description, or statemelt of fad. Under the second, they are objeds of estimation or contempt, ofpraife or censure.

In refped to what men have adtually done or exhibited, human nature is a subjet of history and physical science: Confidered in refped. to the different measures of good and evil, of which men are susceptible, the fame nature is a subjet of discipline and moral fciencc.

In treating of Man, as a subjed of history, we collecc fads,

and endeavour to conceive his nature as it adtually is, or has acnually been, apart from any notion of ideal pcrfcdtion, or defect.

Vor,. T. A I

INTROD. In treating of him as a subjea of moral science, we endeavour k-vo1w to understand what he ought to be; without being limited, in our 
conception, to the measure of attainment or failure, exhibited in the cafe of any particular person or society of men.

To have an object or purpose, and to employ means for the attainment of it, is the diftinaive condition of Mind or Intelligent Being. The first implies Will and Choice: The second implies Energy and Power. For man, therefore, to know his province,
and to be qualified for his station, requires equally that he Ihould be acquainted with the foundations of both.

Animals have power, confiting in muscular strength; and, in 
this refpec, Man is inferior to many of the brutes: But his dominion in nature is derived from a different fource;-from his superior skill, and the authority of a mind over-ruling and wife.

The power of the husbandman consists in the knowledge of 
foils and manures: That of the physician in his knowledge of the animal ceconomy, diet, and food. The power of the engineer consists in his knowledge of the laws of motion, to which the firucure of his works should be fitted: And it may be said of mankind in general, that an extenfionof knowledge is an acceflion of power.

Where fubjeds are within the reach of man, and may be difposed of at pleasure, knowledge of the laws of nature, or of the forms according to which nature herself proceeds, in refped to such fubjets, will enable the artifs, in every branch, to have the operation of nature repeated to his refpeeive effcA or purpose.

The 
The chemist, by his knowledge of a menstruum, can have the INTROD.

hardest substance of metal dissolved, or reduced into a fluid tfate; 'r as Archimedes, by his knowledge of the lever, we are told, could have ships suspended in the air, with all their lading and crews.

To man there is a subjea of fludy, and a material of art, of 
more immediate concern than the foil from which he raises his food, or the mechanical resistance which he may wish to overcome: His own mind is a province of more importance, and more entirely fubjeted to his government.

It is somewhere mentioned by Mr Addison, as a notion among 
the ftatuaries, that in every block of marble, there is an exquisite figure, if the sculptor be qualified only to remove the superfluous matter. This manner of exprefling the fitness of marble to be employed in statuary, may, perhaps with less indulgence of fancy, be applied to mind. Here there is a godlike form of underftanding and of will, that may be found by every person who is desirous to find it, and who is resolute to clear away the erroneous matter under which it is concealed and disfigured. Here also, we may presume that knowledge is power; and that, whoever is successful in the ltudy of his own nature, as he may lay the foundations of a happy. choice in the exercise of his will, so he may lay the foundations of power also, in applying the laws of his nature to the command of himself.

The subjed, even to those who give it no attention, is ever present and familiar; and, for this reason, perhaps, the less understood.

The mind is qualified by nature to recognise itself; but,
on account of the little use which is commonly made of this quaA 2 lification,

INTROD. lification, it is aptly enough compared to the eye, that perceives 
every objet besides itself. In moRs men, indeed, intelligence appears to be little more than a principle of life, or a species of organ employed in the perception of external things, but incapable of stating itself as a subjeA of reflecion or fludy. It is thus that the vulgar, by disuse, or by the habit of attending only to what is presented to'their senses, lose or impair the powers of refletion; and even men of science, excited by the desire of knowledge, become intimate with the laws of every nature but their own; and the more they pursue other objects of study, the more they are confirmed in the habit of neglecding themselves: Infomuch, that, in a period of many pretensions to science, it became the first office of moral wisdom pradtifed by Socrates, to recal the attention of mankind from the heavens to the earth, or from the consideration of things remote to the near and immediate concerns of human life.

The only condition on which we can receive information of this 
matter is, that we attend to the saCs of which we are conscious in ourselves; and whoever pretends to tell us of any thing new, or that is not of our own minds, has mistaken his subjec, or would mislead us from it.

Questions may be Rated, and a method proposed; but he alone 
who can recur to himself with proper refleCtion can make any advance in such studies. And although, in the following pages,
there may appear a continual effort to state the argument, as well as to arrange the matter in queflion; yet the Author is sensible that method is the principal aid he can give, and that, to fuccced in the study of mind, every reader must perform the work for hims elf.

A

A principal difficulty, indeed, in entering upon the fludy of INTROB.

our own nature, may arise from the familiarity of the subjeCt,
and from a presumption that we are already possessed of full information. The mind is conscious of itself, and the learner of moral wisdom is himself the witness to be cited in evidence of the truth.
le mufi be content to recollecd what every one knows; to value a fad rather for its consequence than its novelty; and even to value it the more for its being notorious and common. It is from the ordinary course of things that the laws of nature are colleted; and it is upon the fame ordinary course that the artist must rely for the conduct of his art, and the success of his operations.
In so much that, although things new and strange may amuse the imagination; yet the affectation of novelty is often misplaced in science of any kind, but no where so much as in the study of mind; concerning which, the fadts, if fairly flated, cannot be new to the mind itself.

In determining the course which man ought to run, we must 
observe the fleps he is qualified to make, and guess at the termination of his progress, fi-om the beginning of it, or from the diredCionin which he sets out.

As the fludy of human nature may refer to the aetual flatc,

or to the improveable capacity, of man, it is evident, that, the fubjeAs being conneCted, we cannot proceed in the second, but upon the foundations which are laid in the first. Our knowledge of what any nature ought to be, must be derived from our knowledge of its faculties and powers; and the attainment to be aimed at must be of the kind which these faculties and powers are fitted to produce. From the Horse we cannot expect the flight of the Eagle, nor from the Eagle the firm pace and ftrcngth of the Horse.

It 
INTROD. It is too common, in treating of human affairs, to indulge some 
we^^^- bias to panegyric or satire. The last may gratify our spleen;

as the first, by raising the pretensions of a nature in which we partake, may flatter our vanity. But, though either may proceed from an allowable disposition, the one from partiality to our kind, the other from indignation at vice; yet they are surely mifplaced, and ought to be avoided in disquisitions of science, where the objec is to ascertain sac and reality, and in our judgement neither to over-rate, nor depreciate the fubjeat; but to cultivate the good of which it is susceptible, and to restrain the evil to which it is exposed.

In this, with all the intimacy of every individual with himself,

he has much to learn, not only in the habit of which the vulgar are so little possessed, the habit of observing what passes in their own minds, but likewise in the habit of turning what they know of themselves to account.

There is also much to be learned from the system of things,

in the midst of which mankind are placed, and from the varieties of aspet under which the species has appeared in different ages and nations. So far, without being disqualified to recollea our own feelings and thoughts, we may indulge the habit of looking abroad for obje&s of observation; or, in doing so, may rather be incited to study the intimate principles of our own nature, which have appeared with so many signal effects in the history of mankind.

For this reason it is thought proper, in the choice of our method, to look abroad into the general order of things, and to contemplate the place as well as the description of man, while we endeavour 
deavour to fix the diflinaion of good and evil relative to his na- INTROD.
ture; a diflindsion which may be colleced from his situation relative to other beings, as well as from the description of what he is in himself.

The Author, in some of the itatements which follow, may be 
thought partial to the Stoic philosophy; but is not conscious of having warped the truth to suit with any system whatever. His notions were taken up, where certainly Truth might be learned,
however little it were formed into system by those from whom it was colleced.

The Stoics conceived human life under the image of a Game;

at which the entertainment and merit of the players consisted in playing attentively and well, whether the stake was great or finall .
This game the author has had occasion to fee played in camps,
on board of ships, and in presence of an enemy, with the fame or greater ease than is always to be found in the most secure fituations: And his thoughts were long employed to account for this appearance, before he adverted to the illufiration which is given by Epiaetus, in the above allusion to a game of chance or of idill.

If his inquiries led him to agree with the tenets that were held 
by a fed of philosophers about two thousand years ago, he is the more confirmed in his notion; notwithitanding the name of this fed has become, in the gentility of modern times, proverbial for tfupidity.

Cicero See Discourses of Epiiletus prefcrved by Arr;an, Book II. c. c.

INTROD. Cicero in his mere Speculations was an Academic, and prosessed indiscriminate Scepticism: But, when he came to inftrua his son in the duties of morality, he seized on the principles of the Stoic philosophy, as the most applicable to the conduct of human life. From this source also the better part of the Roman law was derived; and, to such decided difRindion of right and wrong, jurisprudence must ever recur; as, in framing its rules,
regard muff be had to justice alone, whether the matter be of great or small account.

Even in modern times, and at the distance of many ages, notwithstanding the vulgar contempt, this sect has been revered by those who were acquainted with its real spirit, Lord Shaftesbury,
Montesquieu, Mr Harris, Mr Hutchison, and many others.
And surely one of the first leflons that ought to be learned by youth, however others may be pass the time of learning it, is-Neither to admire nor to contemn what they do not know.

There is not perhaps in this colleiCon any leading thought, or 
principle of moment, that may not be found in the writings of others; and, if the author knew where, he might have been as well employed in pointing them out as in composing this book: But the latter is perhaps the easier taflk of the two; and, as the concurrence of many in the fame thoughts is not a presumption of their falrehood, it is no reason why they should be omitted here.
The object is not novelty, but benefit to the ftulent. The Author will not negledS citing those who have gone before him, as often as he is sensible of having borrowed his thoughts, or as often as he recollcts at the moment, that the ftudcnt can with advantage be referred to other inflrutors.

The 
The work consists of two parts. The firit relating to the Fad, INTROD.

or matter of description, and ifatement, in the history of man's vo progressive nature. The second to the Principles of Right, or the foundations of judgement and choice, whether in matters of personal quality, law, manners, or political eflabliihments.

The obje&, in these different parts refpeftively, is to ascertain the foundations of power and of choice in human nature.

In entering on the first part, it appeared not unlikely to furniih 
itriking and inftruaive views of the fubjedc, to contemplate man as a mere part in this system of living natures; and to indulge the mind in pursuing analogies which extend to him even from the lower orders of being, as well as to view him in his points of elevation and contrait.

For this reason are stated, as in the firlt chapter of the following part, The distinCtion of natures living and adive; and, among there, the diftinccion of animals aflociating and political; which lead, by a thread of analogy, to man, diftinguiflied as he is by intelligence and the powers of observation and choice; and more especially, by his destination to know himself, to perceive, in the frame of nature, intelligence superior to his own, and to become his own maifer in the attainment of qualities that constitute the perfedion of his being.

As the history of mind, with the laws of man's progreflive nature, are to him primary objedts of knowledge, and the foundations of that power which he is to exercise over himself, there are principal objcAs ofconfideration, and furnish the fubjeds of the second and third chapters. With rcfpet to these matters, howVoL. I. B ever,

I1 IROD. ever, the fads are presented not as discoveries, but as the data,

' / from which to infer the judgements and conclusions of the second 
part, relating to the foundations of choice, or what. man ought to wiih for himself, for his country, and for mankind.

The Author is sensible that a work of this fort, to be properly 
executed, ought to be calculated, not for any particular class of readers, but for mankind. And, although he cannot flatter himself with the thoughts of having attained this high point of perfecion, he is willing to hope, that, as his defecs of one fort may be forgiven by the learned; so his allusions to abstruse points of science, in treating the history of mind, or his quotations from antient languages, may, without any prejudice to the general firain of his argument, be palsed over by readers, to whom such allusions or quotations are not familiar: And he hopes that there may be enough betides entitled to the candour, or within the compefence, of every one who may be disposed to peruse his work.

Vegetables aftlmilate to their own refpe¢ive natures the substance with which they are nourished; and, whilst they seem to work for themselves alone, a6cually fit up materials for the support of a different order of beings.

The fundion of vegetating life terminates in the growth or decline of the individual, and in the propagation of the ipecies.
Every plant has a limited range, over which he can difiribute his foliage and roots; farther is incapable of changing his place;
and, even in this, does not appear to ad from will.

The first diftindion of animal nature appears in will, and in 
the exemption from the local bondage of plants. In this order of being, there are periods of growth and decline, an afTumption of nourishment, and a discharge of superfluous matter, analogous to what was observed among vegetables: There is an organization or combination of parts fitted to perform these functions,
analogous to the roots and foliage of plants; but the animal prepared for motion, or change of place, carries his roots in a.portable form, and wrapt up in himclf. I-Ic goes in fcarch of his food; and, whether from observation or inflintdivc dirceion,

The function of vegetating life terminates in the growth or decline of the individual, and in the propagation of the ipecies.
Every plant has a limited range, over which he can distribute his foliage and roots; farther is incapable of changing his place;
and, even in this, does not appear to ac from will.

The first diftindion of animal nature appears in will, and in 
the exemption from the local bondage of plants. In this order of being, there are periods of growth and decline, an assumption of nourishment, and a discharge of superfluous matter, analogous to what was observed among vegetables: There is an organization or combination of parts fitted to perform these functions,
analogous to the roots and foliage of plants; but the animal prepared for motion, or change of place, carries his roots in a'portable form, and wrapt up in himfclf. He goes in search of his food; and, whether from observation or inffinCtiv direction,
llccs what is fit for his purpose.

T'lI

PArT 1. 'l'lie bodies of animals are fitted by their firulure to the inI def.inite variety of scenes in which their food is to be found, and Si.c'(. 1.

to an indefinite variety of exertion which their lot requires them to make. Some live immersed in tlhe waters; others fly in the air, live on the fi.;fltce of the earth, burrow in the ground, or asfct an intermediate slate among the branches of trees or fummits of rocks.

Tn all the auimals tlere is a iltncfs for fomre species of action,

and a difjofition to engage in it; and, in many, there is a difpofition to employ the ac'ive powers, with which they are furnifllcd, for recreation and sport, as well as for the supply of their wants. They have their times of exertion and repose ; and entire kinds are diltinguifhed by the degrees in which they are unequally addiced to one, or to the other. If the fhell-fifi on the shore perform no visible adcion, but that of opening or closing his shell to receive the brine that accommodates, or to exclude the foul matter that annoys, him; there are other animals tllat in the opposite extreme, are adive, and for whom nature seems to administer the means of supply merely as a restorative of that strength, which they are so freely to waste in the seemingly fportive or violent exercises to which they are disposed.

Next to voluntary change of place, another and a higher diitincion of animals is, their sensibility, or capacity of enjoyment and suffering, joined to a purpose of acion, regulated by these considerations. We are apt to appropriate enjoyment to the inrervals of reft which the animal nature, in every instance, more or tcfs requires; and fuppofc pleasure a condition of'mere inactive flnfation: But it cannot be doubted that the higher fiecics of animals enjoy or have pleasure also in the a xive t cxcrtion of thei:r

the course of their species in the midst of hardflips and toils. y-Y
They are, without doubt, by nature inclined to employ the organs, with which they are furnifled, to the peculiar effeds which these organs serve to obtain. In following this disposition, they display and improve the beauty of their refpedive forms; and then suggest the highest conceptions of wisdom in the author of their frame, when they exhibit, in full exertion of force, the limbs and organs of which they are potreft.

Animals are furnished with infUintive principles of self preservation, in the pain by which they are apprised of what is hurtful, in the pleasure which allures them to what is salutary, in the caution with which they approach any appearances that are dangerous or strange; and, molft of all, in the horror that affects them at any thing that carries the aspee of death: Yet, in many of the nobler animals, every principle of this fort appears to be suspended, as often as the occasion of great aAive exertion is presented. On such occalions, to a certain extent, the ardour and intensity of the effort seems to increase the pleasure it gives; and,
as difficulty, danger, and hardship, require a proportional increase of ardour and force, they seem to increase the enjoyment also, and render an animal that is inured to the most difliculk talk, proportionably indifferent to what would exercise his powers, butin a lower degree. It is thus that the hound, which has been broke to the chafe of the wolf, or the boar, will fearcel '
deign to pursue the hare or the fox.

As the difficulties, which an animal encounters in the exertion 
of his powers, are likely to be greatest, where they are met in opposition by equal powers of the ltmc kind, aliimlls appear to dcjiil;

FART I. light in measuring their force and address one with another, and SCHA. i. seek for occasions of opposition and contest, not only in the comSECT. 1.

'-y- petition fubfiftingbetweenindividuals of a different,or hoftilekind,

but also between individuals of the fame species.

The disposition of an animal to contest and struggle is thus often 
free from hostility; and the very fondling of creatures in the best terms with each other is an image of war. They have their emulations on the points of dexterity and strength, to which they are ever ready to sacrifice their ease and their safety. The sports they seem to delight in the most, are a game in which life itself is at stake, and in which toil, dilaceration, and wounds, are the lot even of the gainer.

Nature, in these instances, appears to disregard the safety and 
peace of her works, and to adopt a deftrueive policy; but the destination of animal life to have an end, is not peculiarly marked in these examples. The parts that meet in the organization of each living frame are destined, after a certain period, to return into the elements from which they were collected, and the powers of life, that waxed for a while, come at last to wear out in their mere exertions; nor can we derive any peculiar ground of censure against the order of nature, from the approaches of death,
in this or any other particular form, where every part of the it ftem terminates in the fame effect.

The Author of nature has not, in any instance, provided for 
perpetuity in the life of any plant or animal. He has indeed furnified the animal with principles offelf-prefervation, tending to Ihifpcnd his doom, and to prolong his being for an indefinite period, but too feeble forever to resist the violence of that general treamn on svhicb he is borne to his eila.

This 
This itself is the order of things in which we must revere the PART I.

arm of power that removes the fleeting generations of plants and CSET. I.
animals, no less than the creative hand that provides a continual pv^
supply of new generations to perpetuate the race.

In mere animals, incapable of reflection, this destination is not 
any cause of distress. In such as do, or may reflec on their lot,
it is an admonition that the value of life is to be estimated from the good it contains, not from the length of its period.

The life of an oak, in some instances, extends beyond the 
record of human tranfaaions ; of other plants the duration is limited by the fun's declination from one to the other tropic.
The period of animal life is also considerably varied. In the elephant, we are told it amounts to two hundred years; in the fly,
that ihews so briflk an alacrity in the fun, it is supposed to begin and to end in the compass of a day: But the sentence of nature is equally pronounced upon all, That the longest liver must die.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
Znd all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Anwait alike th' inevitable hour;
The paths of glory lead but to the grave *.

If from this we are disposed to collec any inference adverse to 
the pursuits of glory, it may be asked, Whither do the paths of ignominy lead ? If to the grave also, then our choice of a life remains to be made on the grounds of its intrinsic value, without regard to an end, which is common to every species of life we can lead, whether illuflrious or obscure.

Of the Dyiin6tion of Animals AJbociating and Political 
PART I. AMONG the varieties of the animal kingdom, some are said to be associating or gregarious, others solitary.


We find the foundation of this diftincion, not in the absolute 
reparation of the individual, in any one species, from every other individual of the fame species, nor in the continual assembling of all the individuals together; but in the less or greater frequency of their concourse, and their ordinary or occasional connection one with another.

All nature indeed is connected; and the world itself consists of 
parts, which, like the flones of an arch, mutually support and are supported.

This order of things consists of movements, which, in a state 
of counteraAion and apparent disturbance, mutually regulate and balance one another. Elements that fink by their weight arc raised by evaporation; the hardefl bodies are fubjced to difs(ilution ; or, in the form of lduti fufpcndcd in water or air, partake in the volubility of tlcec fluids. Vapours raised fromn the fitrflcc of the fca arc wafted over land by the winds; and the 
clouts 
clouds which they form, under various changes of temperature, PART I.
are made to discharge part of their moisture, to nourish the race SE CT. 1L
of plants and animals.

The descending fluid, that would penetrate the pores of the 
earth to its centre, is intercepted by impenetrable strata of rock or of clay, from which it guflles on the declivity of hills, in the form of springs; and descends in rivulets and streams to the ocean, from which it is again raised, to burlt upon the earth in rain and storms..

Thus what appears a war of the elements is the peace of that 
world they compose: The winds are instruments of beneficence;
rain and snow are the gifts of bounty; what seems to be irregular is the perfection of order; the rugged crag and broken hill give a flieltered recess to many inhabitants, and, in all their afperity, fit up the residence of animals, and adorn the profpea to man.

As the movement of parts in nature conspires to the preservation 
and well-being of the whole; as the larger compartments are fitted to their place in the general arrangement; so, in every subdivision, there is a specific economy and relation, verifying, in every class or species of being, the prediletion of nature for combination and mutual subserviency in the members of which the class is composed.

In the vegetable, as well as animal kingdom, generations are 
fliccefiively derived one from another; and the individual in every generation or age, is softercd and protected by the presence of his species. The profpcrity of animals, in their difelrcnt ways 
C z 2(f 
'PART I. of life, results, more or less, from the co-operation of numbers together.


Among the animals in general, and suited to the condition of 
their sensitive nature, the species or kind is to the individual an objea of inftincive attachment. And the participation of fellowcreatures together, is required to complete the enjoyments which they are severally qualified to receive.

The mutual disposition of the sexes, the affections of parent 
and young, are common almost to every description of animals.
In some inflances, indeed, the connection of the sexes is merely oceafional, and that of parent and young of comparatively short duration; insomuch that, after a certain period of solicitude on the part of the parent, and dependence on the part of the young,
the adult, in one class of the animals, affects solitude, and appears to state his fellow creature, even his parent, or his offspring, rather as a competitor and a rival, than as an afflciate or a friend.

Such animals are said to be solitary.

It is however more common, in the animal kingdom, for individuals of a species to haunt the fame places together.

The group, as well as the species, has its separate name, whether of herd, flock, shoal, covey, swarm, company, or society;
which is appropriated to the different orders of beasts, birds, insets, or fishes, and never, but by a species of figure, transferred from one to another. Among there, the term society is appropriated to some collective body of men; and it is always by a fpecies of figure, that beasts are said to associate, or men to herd with one another.

AIlimals 
Animals of this description, though different in the manner PART I

and amount of their connections, as they agree in the general SECr. II.
circumstances of being commonly found in troops, or certain -vwe numbers together, they are said, in contradiftindion to animals of the former class to be associating or gregarious.

Of there, some are observed merely to herd or assemble, with 
little or no appearance of co-operation, or distribution of tafls,
to be performed for any common advantage. Such are many of the birds that flock, and of the pasturing quadrupeds that herd,
together, as the deer, the horse, the cow, the Iheep, the goat;
which, though they do no more than merely pasture together,
are not to be kept affunder without restraint or violence. Such are termed merely gregarious.

Others are observed to combine their labours for a common 
purpose; to distribute their tafls, and assign to different members of the community, the parts which they are required to perform; such, among the quadrupeds, is the beaver; and, among the infeAs, where examples of this fort are most frequent, the ant, the wasp, the bee, and many others.

These, in the translation of an elegant title beltowed upon them by Aristotle, may be termed the gregarious and political .

Under this last designation, we are 'urely authoriied by the 
fad to comprehend the species of man. Wherever there is a plurality of men, there is also a society; and, in society, there is a distribution of parts, and a co-operation of many, to tomen common purpose or end.

That 
PIAART I. That man is found in society cannot be questioned ; that heCHAP. I.
was so originally, or that he is by any amicable difpofitionr atLv-yW J tached to his kind, has become matter of doubt and of controversy..

In deciding this question, parties look forward to consequences;

and, having already made choice of their inference, admit or rejedC even fad itself, in proportion as they conceive it to be fa:ourable or adverse to the conclusion they would form.

According to the system of one of these parties, the human fpecies, though now every where joined in society, and often seemingly at peace, yet every where retains the marks of a condition originally different, if not the reverse; else, why, in the mofl pacific societies, does the citizen think it necessary to fence in, or to secure his dwelling? Against whom does he provide his locks and his bars ? From whom do the rich so carefully conceal their treasures ? Are men so much alarmed in the neighbourhood of aflociates and friends ? Or, do they not rather betray a consciousness of mutual distrust and hoftiiity, apprehending in every neighbour, a spy, or a robber, prepared to betray or to plunder ?

Why, in the most peaceful societies, is the magiflrate armed;

and the very badge of authority a sword of state, or an inftrunient of violence and an object of terror ? Whence is it that nations need so much arrangement, to prefcrve the peace at home,
or to repel invasions from abroad ? For whom are prisons er-eded,
or an apparatus of fetters, chains, and engines of torture providecl? Is the executioner of juflice a fit link in the chain of fiiends and confederates ? Whence, on every fiontier, are firong holds crcclcd, and military fations felccled with so much care?
Are thcfe prcparations made for the reception of fiicnds from 
abroad ?

abroad ? Or do they not rather betray a convition, that, beyond PART I.
the circle, in which men have procured some artificial means CHAP.I.
of tranquillity, they have nothing to expeA but hotfility and V
war.

In answer to these queries, we must admit, that the peace of 
society is, in many inflances, evidently forced, and made to continue by a variety of artificial means.

When we look back to the history of times past, the weak appear to have been driven in herds together, as a common prey to the strong, or to have been forced into leagues and confederacies for common defence. The league, while it continues, is far from being secure; and the parties, but little at ease in this condition, ever ready to quarrel or disband. The pressure of war from abroad, we are told, was required to fRill the dissention of parties, and unite the citizens of Rome together. Without this compressing cause, the bundle of rods., a childifl emblem of union, tied round the shaft of the axe, or instrument of force and of terror, would have had little effe.A in uniting the minds of such a people together.

But from such topics as thefc, we can infer no more, than that 
men, though by nature in society, have a choice of the good or the ill incident to their late : That individuals are sometimes disposed to abuse the advantages of neighbourhood, and to break the peace:
That examples of this fort, whether few or many, require the 
fRittution of government, and the application of penal law: And,

1iomn the whole, it follows, that, although mlan is destined to live with his ftllow-creatures, and mufl, upon this account be clalled ,vith the gregarious animals, yet partics may agrce, or bc at variance;

PART. I. riance; and the individual, having it in his choice to be a good  or an ill member of the society to which he belongs, must incur <JW'/' all the consequences of a choice well or ill made.

To be in society is the physical state of the species, not the moral diflinAion of any particular man. It is the state of those who quarrel, as well as of those who agree. Estrangement is not al.
ways a vice, nor aflociation a virtue. Persons may assemble for contest, as well as for concord. And there are few individuals who have not their enemies as well as their friends: But, in the choice of friendship and enmity, the talk of human wisdom begins, and is there only properly exercised, where the good of society is matter offree choice, not of neceflity, nor even of invariable inftin&.

In the congregation of mere animals, the motives to union on 
the one hand, or the occasions of strife, on the other, are comparatively few, inftinCive, and simple: The troops they compose are uniform in their manner; herds merely pasturing together; or swarms, in the manner of a family, united under a common parent or head, and co-operating in the performance of the fame work together.

In human nature, the afrociating principle is combined with a 
variety of considerations and circumfiances, which lead mankind to vary their forms indefinitely, whether in refpea to the numbers that compose their society, the direction under which a community is to aCf, or the object to which it is chiefly directed.

The name of society may be given to a mere family, a tribe, a 
fclcct company of friends, and to a nation or empire. Of there,
each is an affncmblage of men; and the greater fiill comprehends 
many 
many examples of the less. The principles that operate through- PART r.

man's afficiating nature, require to be enumerated, and confi- -v dered apart. In this enumeration, we may have the advantage,
not of fpedators merely observing the external appearances, from which to conjecure the cause; but, we may have the advantage also of parties concerned, intimately acquainted with the motives to action, from which these effects proceed.

S E C T I O N Il.

Of the 'Principles of Society in Human Nature.

PART. I. T'HE general combination of parts in the system of nature;
the mutual subserviency of different orders of being on this SiCT. I. globe; the natural attachment of individuals, in every species 
of living creature, to some others of their kind; and the frequency of gregarious and political afemblage in the description of different animals, must greatly facilitate the admilron of society as a part in the destination of man; or indeed, joined to the faCt that men are actually found in society, render argument on the subjet of his qualification for such a state entirely superfluous.

The purpose of what follows on this subjet, therefore, is rather 
to specify the charatRer of human society, than to evince its reality, as the slate or condition in which man is deftinedto at.

In a mixed scene of benevolence and malice, it is indeed of importance to determine how far man is, by his nature, limited to one or to the other; or how far he is equally susceptible of either; and deeply concerned in the one, as a good which he ought to chufe,[and in the other, as an evil which he ought to avoid.

Authors, adlnitting the reality of man's actual place in society,
have endeavoured to collec the appearances which mark his fit-.

ness or unfitness for this condition, in order to determine, each PART I.
in his own way, the much agitated question relating to the Rfate of CHAP. I.

nature. ,'Y'

These appearances highly merit our attention; they serve to characerife the species to which we belong, and the scenes in which we ourselves are deflined to aa; they may be collected from any of the tranfadions of men, whether in co-operation or opposition; the first, in the cafe of families, tribes, companies, nations, and empires; the second, in the rivalfhip or competition of parties, whether single men, or communities.

Families may be confidered as the elementary forms of society,

or establishments the most indispensably necessary to the existence and preservation of the kind. As families may exist apart, and without any necessary communication of one group with another,
so they Rill continue to be formed, in whatever numbers mankind may be leagued into larger communities: They are the nur{eries of men; the basis of empires, as well as of nations and tribes;
and the compartments of which the greatest fabrics of political establishment are composed: So that, however little we may need information on the subjea of family connections, it is ma-.
terial to have in our view the principles on which they are formed, as the conflituents of a social character, indelible in every age and in every Rfate of focicty, whether voluntary or forced.

In families, no doubt, the firfl occasion or motive to union is 
the mutual inclination of the sexes; a disposition which is known to suspend, or to exceed in force, every other affection or paflion of the human mind. Its eflects, in particular intfances, is an c.xclufive attachment of the parties, not like the corresponding ditfposition in the other animals, merely periodical and tclnlpori;ll'.

PART I. but a foundation of continual society, extending to all times and easons; the result of it, in the general history of mankind,
.

xY_ is such as to have rendered some institution of marriage universal 
or common. In this institution, the relation of husband and wife is accompanied with that of parent and child; and the increase of numbers is procured without consulting the mind, or the intention of the parties. This effea is, to the race, what the vital motion of the heart is to the individual; too necessary to the preservation of nature's works, to be entrusted to the precarious will or intention of those most nearly concerned.

That the birth of a man is more painful and hazardous; that 
the state of his infancy is more helpless, and of longer duration,
than is exemplified in the cafe of any other species, may be ranked with the -apparent comparative defects of his animal nature:
But this circumstance, we may venture to affirm, like many others of his seeming defects, is of a piece with that superior deftination, which remains to be fulfilled in the subsequent hiRfory of mankind.

His birth is marked with circumstances that make a deep impression in the parent's breast: It is at once a delivery from anxiety, danger, and pain: It is an acquisition, of which the value is indefinite, and fondly enhanced: It is the opening of a new blossom of hope in a breast still trembling with fear, and awake to every sentiment of tender concern, solicitude, and love.

The only eflort of the child, or all he can do for himself, is to 
ra-il the feeble cry of distress, in which he announces at once the gladl tidings of life, and his need of assistance; and his cry is more powerful to obtain this affiflance, than the most vigorous exertions of which the young of other animals, at their entry in2 to 
to life, are capable; it reaches the ear and the heart of those who PART I.
have means, understanding, and power, fitted to supply the re- SECAP. I.
lief which is wanted, and who continue through life to seek the advantage of their child, in preference to any interest of their own.

Were the infant capable of observing the state to which he is 
born, he would find himself confederate in a league, to which,
besides the pleaufre of serving him, he contributes nothing. His inability to make any return, however, but interests, the more, a tender affection, of which he is the object; and the solicitude he brings, serves but to rivet that affieion, by the continued repetition of its cares.

His first smile of complacency, and his first attempts to cling,

with an appearance of predilection, to the breast that supports him, are an ample reward for all the pains which his birth, or his preservation, has occasioned. No one has yet been so bold as to maintain, that, in this instance, the human heart is incapable of love, and formed alone for interested connections: That a mother, in presenting the breafi to her child, has a view only to some future returns of advantage to herself.

If, in this relation, the period of anxiety, on the part of the 
parent, and of dependence or weakness, on the part of the young,
be prolonged beyond the time that is ufial in the cafe of other animals, these teeming disadvantages are more than compensated in the pleasure which a parent enjoys from the continuation of his cares, and in the effect of a dependence, which is the germ of that social connection, which man is defsined to have with his kind, in a much higher form than is known in any other species of animals.

The 
PART I The infant's grounds ofconnecRion with his parents, in the earCHAP. I.
 lier period of life, is that of being placed in their hands, and in a v/~y\j relation with them, from which he cannot recede. He is born in 
society, and, while unconscious of benefit or wrong, is anxiously preserved in his Rtate. When he begins to perceive his condition, and is in any measure left to choose for himself; he is ever at the heel of his parent, and dreads being left behind as the moil fatal misfortune. At every interval of reparation, he longs to recover the company in which he was born, and feels, through life,
whatever may assec the honour or welfare of his family, as the most serious concern of his own.

Before the force of the first family 'affetion is spent, relations 
multiply, and inftinaive attachments grow into habit. Brothers and sifters come to co-operate in the fame cause together;
and a third generation Sometimes appears, before the second or the third are separated from the original Rfock: Collaterals grow up together, frill apprised of their relation; and, even when feparated, are taught to regard consanguinity as a bond of connection, which extends beyond the limits of acquaintance or perfonal intercourse of any fort.

It is thus that the supposed descendants of a race are multiplied 
into a tribe, in which many families are included, adopting some common point of honour, or some common cause, in which the kindred partake.

Under this denomination of a tribe or clan, numbers of men 
are leagued together, and often endeared by the experience of asfeaion, fidelity, and courage ; while they mutually support and are supported, or run the carecr of fortune together.

The 
The tenderness of parents had a specific name in the language PART 1.

ofthe Greeks *. In ours, it is termed natural affection, as being CHAP. I.
peculiarly inspired by nature, and precluding even the choice of __, its object.

Natural affection springs up in the foul, as the milk springs in 
the mother's breast to furnifl a nourishment to her child. Whether piety in the child be natural, in the fame sense, may be quetfioned. He clings indeed to the parent's breast, or shrinks from a stranger: But these are, perhaps, no more than the first efforts of self preservation, in which he abides by that which he has experienced to be friendly or safe, and declines, as doubtful,
what is strange or unknown: And habit may confirm the predilecion he has formed, while he continues to apprehend, in the person of his parent, the source of every comfort of which he has any experience, or which he is any way qualified to receive.

That the relation of consanguinity, beyond that of brother and 
sifter, at leafi, operates as a mere occasion of acquaintance, intimacy, and co-operation in the fame cause together, is frill less fiufceptible of doubt. Relations are attached, or are at variance,
according as their humours agree; but the spirit of clanfi:p,
which is so frequent in human nature, abundantly proves a difposition in man to avail himself of every pretence, upon which he can league with those among whom his lot and his acquaintance has fallen.

Company is the solace of human life; and, it will not be difputed that, in the abience of every interested design, companionii

PART 1. meet from a common dislike of solitude, or a common inclina:HAP. I. tion to the fame pursuits and occupations; nor willit be doubted SK.c r. III.

i^vv tthat, from mere acquaintance, persons tried in fidelity, affection,

and good underfianding, actually become friends, on the most permanent foundations of attachment and confidence.

The love of company is a principle common to man with all 
the gregarious animals. So far, it is merely instinctive, and gratified indiscriminately in the presence of a fellow-creature of the fame ipecies. Animals, endowed with this instinCt, will force their way through every impediment to jointhe herd they affect;
but, beyond the mere concourse of numbers, rarely appear to have any selection or choice.

With man, the fadt is different: He is ever disposed to felec 
his company, and to shun, as well as to embrace, an acquaintance.
The characters of men are unequal; and the choice of one frequently implies the rejection of another. But, to felea a companion, or a friend, is not to be unsociable: It is to assec society, but to know the ditfindtion of good and evil in this important connection.

As men have a greater extent and variety of concerns, whether 
mistaken or real, in which their pursuits may interfere; so they have more frequent occasions of strife than are incident to individuals of any other species of gregarious animals. What we term reason in man, or intelligence ib imperfect as his, is more liable than inftindt to err, and miflake its objects. Hence offences are taken and given, and the minds of men alienated from one another, upon imaginary, as well as upon real grounds of dislike.

Mere estrangement approaches to jealousy; and men do not desire to associate with persons entirely unknown. Hence the 
species 
species is never observed to aA in one, but in manifold troops PART I.
and companies; and, although without any physical bar to pre- SHAPr. II
vent their union, are frill observed, under the notion of inde- .v pendence and freedom, to affect reparation.

Hence the multiplicity of hordes in barbarous ages: But, in 
human nature, separation itself has an effect in firaitening the bands of society; for the members of each separate nation feel their connection the more, that the name of fellow-countryman flands in contradiftinAion to that of an alien.

In this divided slate of the world incompatible interests are 
formed, or, at least, apprehended; and the members of different societies are engaged on opposite fides; affecion to one fociety becomes animosity to another; and they are not always to be reckoned of the most sociable disposition who equally fawn upon all. Indifference, more than candour, is likely to produce the appearance of impartiality, when the cause of our friend, or our country, is at flake.

Even here, however, what seems to divide the species tends 
also to unite them in leagues more extensive than they would otherwife form. Hence the coalition of families, tribes, and extensive tracts of country, into nations, under political eftablifliments, that combine the strength and the resources of many for common protection and safety.

The love of company is gratified in the resorts of a few; and 
predilection ever implies acquaintance and esteem: But national cftablilhments far exceed these bounds ; and comprehend, in the fhlme state or community, pcrfons far removed from one another,
and mutually unknown.

fucceflve annexations of territory, is not reftrided within any fjiecial limits. Ambition often leads the growing slate to extend its dimensions far beyond any real advantage: And, in the result of war, communities, once proud of their separate eftablifliments,
and the lustre of their history, are made to discontinue their own institutions, and to receive the laws, by which they are governed, from abroad..

When provinces, remote from one another, without any national intercourse, participation of language, manners, or interest,,
are reduced to acknowledge a common head, or to join in their contributions to enrich a common mailer; the associating principle, in such examples, if we must call it by that name, is force,.
or rather the ambition of sovereigns, than the will of the people,
or even the interests of slate. Upon this principle, the inhabitants of cities and territories, unknown to one another, become fellow fubj.ecs, and owe their connetion to the force by which they were subdued, and by which they are kept in subj ction: But this force itfdf was the combination of numbers employed in conquest.

The conquered become an accession. to empire, in which.nations are absorbed, or changed into provinces that have no feeling of attachmente,

tachment, nor even community of interest. But, if empires thus PART I.

extend beyond the limits to which the social affeCtions of man have .
reached, there affections nevertheless continue to subsist in different sw divisions of the largest dominion. They subsist in the family, in the neighbourhood, in the felet company ofacquaintance, and in the attachment of friends. There even arises, in the largest empires, a national spirit, with which the fubjedt cordially serves his bovereign, and contends for the honour and safety of his country.

The mind of man has a fellow-feeling with what befals a fellow 
creature, which is so much conceived as an appurtenance of human nature, as, in common language, to be called humanity,
and confidered as a charaCteristic of the species. Under the effects of this disposition, even to be a stranger is a recommendation, and a ground of regard.

Much remains to be observed on this subjet, that cannot be 
classed with the appurtenances of mere animal nature. Where man rifes above this predicament, his destination to range with a system, and make a part in a comprehensive order of things,
becomes still more conspicuous. His understanding is a power of comprehension, qualifying him to perceive, and to estimate the bearings of a whole, through all its parts, to some common end,
or beneficial effet; and his moral judgements give sanCtion to the propriety of his own character or action, in the society of his fellow creatures. The great diftintion of right and wrong, of virtue and vice, on which men experience such extremes of complacence or indignation, of esteem or contempt, is formed on the dictates of a focialdifpofition, which receives, with favour and love,
what conflitutes the good of mankind, or rejects, with difapprobation and abhorrence, what is of a contrary nature.

S E C T IO N IV,
Of the Itzercourfe and Conzmunication of Aimals, and of the Language of Man.

ANIMALS, where individuals interfere, or associate with one PART T.
another, ever have some power of expression. Every dam has a CHAP. I.
call for her young; and in every flock or herd, there are signs SET. rV.
that bring numbers together, signs of enjoyment or suffering, of desire or aversion; and, even among rivals and enemies, there are signs of alarm, of defiance, or rage.

So far, individuals almost of every species, communicate one 
with another. The living frame, in every part that composes it,
and in every movement of which it is susceptible, bears the charader of life, and spontaneous effort, of which the mere.f animalsare mutually sensible.

The human figure, in a special degree, by every adioin;

annd every gesture, is significant of meaning and will: The power of interpretation corresponds to the power of exprefsion; and men are qualified to undcrftand what they are by nature disposed to exprcfs. Every one is diifpofed to communicate what he thinks, and to receive communication of what is thought by others,

'The 
PART. I. The means, of whatever kind, employed in the intercourse of Cl,1AP. I.
 persons, may be comprehended under the designation of lanY'w've guage. In this general use of the term, the sign of a meaning or 
will, though no way resembling the thing signified, is in some instances fixed by nature, employed spontaneously, and underflood or interpreted, by virtue of an original faculty, corresponding to the instinct which leads to the use of it, and equally prior to experience or inffruation of any fort. Of this kind are looks and gestures, changes of colour, and tones of the voice, which proceed from what is pafling in the mind of one person, and make it known to another, without any previous convention or agreement of the parties so to express themselves, or to be so understood.
The smile and the frown are untaught and unpremeditated expressions ofpleafure and displeasure. They are understood by the infant at the breast, and returned by him, before he has any knowledge of the organs, or features, on which they are traced.'
To the latest hour of human life, every pafion, and every asfecion, give outward signs of their existence, and often betray a Rate of the mind, which the party concerned would wifl to conceal.

Many actions of men, by a natural connection with their motives, discover a meaning, as an effect discovers its cause. Here,
indeed, the sign is affixed in the nature of things; but the interpretation is often to be learned from experience, and is the result of peculiar sagacity, not of mere instinct, as in the former inflances, in which tones of voice, or features of the countenance, are,
by appointment of nature, expreflive of Sentiment or thought.
Thus, when the husbandmen is seen to break up his lea, he is underftood to intend a crop of corn. When a general moves with his army, he is understood to have some design of attack or retreat. But 
2 the 
the interpretation, in either cafe, is not merely intintive, but PRTr I.
an effort of sagacity tutored by experience. 


Language may be divided into three principal parts, viz. mute 
signs, speech, and written characters. Of the firit we may observe the effecs in every pantomime, in which, without a single accent of found, the beginning, middle, and end of a fable, are completely made known. The Englifli Harlequin is condemned to dumb shew, but has no occasion for words, nor even for looks. He performs in silence, and even in a mafik. His geftures, his approaches, flights, and disguises, are sufficient to express the passions of fondness or fear, by which he is agitated, and to give warning of the evasions and tricks he is meditating.

Such natural signs, and inflinAive or conjeCtural interpretations,

may be confidered as the original flock which nature hasfurnifh-ed to man, and with which he may proceed in concerting more arbitrary signs of speech, or of written characters, thereby to extend the means of communication, and enable him to express himself more fully, on all the fubjedts of observation, or thought,

rn thus proceeding to enrarge the fund ofexpreflon, by adding 
the use of speech to the flock of inflindive or natural signs, the principle of life in man, by whatever name we may call it, of rnind,
or intelligence, has occasion to liew an extent or variety of powers, and to produce, in a form obvious to fenfc, a multiplicity of Ilores, whether of conception, sentiment, or will, greatly exceeding what any of the other animals appear to poffTe..

In the use of this wonderful expedient, man is enabled 
to name every subjeCt in nature, and to mark its relations;
or; by mere inflections of found, to express the modifications of thought, fen.timcnr, and will to a degree of fubtlcty 
01'

PART I. or nice discrimination, in numberless parts, which it becomes CTHP. P. difficult for the grammarian, or the metaphysician, to arrange ry-.'j under the titles to which they refpedively belong.

Such are the effects of language, when extended to the use of 
conventional signs, whether of speech or of written characters.
With refped to its origin and history, a variety of queflions may occur.

IJl, Whether speech be peculiar to man ? This queflion we 
may venture to answer in the affirmative: For, although other animals learn from him to articulate founds, and thereby shew that there is not any absolute inability of their organs for this purpose; yet, they have not the meaning affixed to the founds they articulate. And, if some animals, without being able to articulate, take the meaning of words, as the dog or the horse knows his name, and obeys the command of his mailer; yet we cannot, by any means, admit that they are fitted to partake with man,
in the formation or use of language.

Another question may be, Whether speech be natural to man?

The use of his voice, in the exprefion of sentiment or passion,

no doubt, is natural, as are also many other modes of expression by change of colour, looks, and geflures; but that he has artificially extended the catalogue of signs, no one can doubt, especially in distinguishing founds by articulation, and in multiplying words to express the indefinite variety of things, of thoughts, fentimcnts, and intentions. HIe might possibly have wrought in the fame manner, and, as the dumb are actually known to do, on the original flock of significant geflure or mute signs: But the voice ;:nd the organs of fpecch and ofhearing, have so many advanta- ges 
ges over other means ofexprefflon, that they were likely to prevail; PART I.
to become the favourite, and in some fort the natural engine of 
communication.

In the use of articulate founds, the variation of signs is effeced with the greatest facility, and with the greatest quickness of fuccefion; the medium of the air in which found is produced, is always present, and conveys it in every diretion; the organ of hearing is ever open to receive the impression, has great sensibility and discriminating power; at the fame time that the pronunciation of words may be accompanied with aclion, gesture, or visible sign of any fort: So that we may clearly perceive the ground of that preference which mankind have universally given to the practice of speech, without supposing it otherwise natural, than as it is obviously expedient and recommended by its use.

It may nevertheless be questioned by some, whether the use of the tongue, so universal to mankind, be not inftincive.

To utter found, in exprefiion of meaning, is no doubt inftinctive to man, as to most of the other animals that breathe the air of the atmosphere. But inftinC is uniform in its effects; and if speech were inftincive, we ihould have all mankind speak the fame language, as every bird of the fame species has the fame call,
and repeats his song.

The great diversification of language implies the fame latitude 
of invention and choice, in this, as in other arts pradifed by man. But how shall we conceive this invention to have been made, communicated, and adopted by all mankind? Whether,
like that of other ingenious arts, may it be traced to the cafual or special exertion of one or a few ingenious men ? This we 
VOL. I. F are 
PART I. are told by tradition, was the origin of letters or written chaCH'P. 1. racers. But the poets alone venture to tell us that speech was SEc'r. aV.
* -v'- taught in the fame manner, by some founder of rationality and 
civilization.

This is a work which every separate nation or tribe appears to 
have performed for itself. And what, in one form or other, is univerfal to mankind, cannot have been the invention of one or a few: We cannot suppose one nation, or race of men, to have learned from another that in which all the separate races of men difser from one another; nor can we suppose what is indefinitely varied, in the pratice of every separate horde, to have been'the copy of any single invention.

If we are asked, therefore, who was the inventor of articulate 
founds? and, without being led by any degree of conneEtion between the sign and the thing signified, taught mankind a name for every known subjed, a name for every quality, for every relation of things, for every thought or sentiment of the mind, a form for every proposition, whether interrogatory, affirmative, or negative, whether doubtful or certain, general or particular ? who taught the tongue to vary the inflecions of found, to keep pace with the variations of meaning ? We may venture to answer, that Mind,
or the principle of life in man, is competent to this effect; as fire,
wherever it be lodged in any corporeal mass, is competent to expansion, fusion, or evaporation. In natures stationary, like those of molt animal species, an original fRock of instinctive expression may be 1 ufficient for every purpose of life: But, in the progressive nature of man, it is necefrary that the flock of language flould wax with the growing occasions on which it is employed. And, although no fingle genius, however vast, is equal to the invention of a language,
luch as even the vulgar speak, we may yet conceive that a talent for

ing 

in such signals as occurred, or were nearest at hand, has enabled S
the parties mutually to understand, and be understood, so as to give to the vernacular dialec of every society, in the result of their efforts, its degree of enlargement, and use.

When this end is obtained, in the degree which is common in 
many different societies and ages, the Speculative mind is apt to look back with amazement from the height it has gained; as a traveller might do, who, rising insensibly on the slope of a hill,
ihould come to look from a precipice of an almofft unfathomable depth, to the summit of which he could scarcely believe himself to have ascended without supernatural aid.

Parts of speech, which, in speculation, cost the grammarian so 
much study, are in practice familiar to the vulgar: The rudest tribes, even the idiot, and the insane, are possessed of them: They are soonest learned in childhood; insomuch, that we must suppose human nature, in its lowest state, competent to the use of them; and, without the intervention of uncommon genius, mankind, in a succession of ages, qualified to accomplifll in detail this amazing fabric of language, which, when raised to its height,
appears so much above what could be ascribed to any fimultaneous effort of the most sublime and comprehensive abilities.

We are apt to treat the origin of language, as we treat that of 
society itself, by supposing a time when neither existed; but,
from the saCs now stated, we may venture to infer, that, since mankind were fairly entered on this scene of human life, there never was any such time; that both associating and speaking, in however rude a form, are coeval with the fpecics of man.

F There

 species ofexpreffion where any concourse of numbers took place;

<v-V and mankind, firom the first, had a flock at leafl of inftinlive expreflion, on which they wrought, endeavouring to supply its defecls by the addition of some farther sign, whether gesture or word.

If we would know, therefore, by what process mankind have 
advanced in accumulating the parts of speech, we have perhaps only to observe what they are now atually performing: For, in the most accomplished itate of any art, the highest attainment is no more than a continuation of the firfl attempts. Commerce,
in the earliest period of its existence, confifed in the exchange of a commodity that eould be spared for one that was wanted:
When most extended by the use of tallies, money, bank paper,
and bills of exchange, it is still the barter of what can be spared for what is required in return.

Language, in its rudest state, furniflhed some means of exprefsion, inftincive or casual: In-its most accomplished Rfate, the flock of exprefflon is greatly enlarged; but men do not acquiesce in the last Rate of their language any more than they do in the first: They change their words, to accommodate the circumfiances in which they have occasion to use them. They find new forms of expression for every new subjed, and, rather than not effecl any change, give way to the slightest movements of caprice or fancy.

Thus 
Thus, men at work on the present flock of their language, whc- PART I.

of expreflion; if it be wanted, the language is thereby improv- >
ed; if unneceflary, it is actually corrupted: but, on either supposition, it flews the capacity of man to effect, by degrees that gradual accumulation of signs, on which the progress of language consists. The beautiful analogy of expression, on which the rules of grammar are eftablifled, is agreeable to the genius of man.
Children are frequently misled by it, and mirfake the practice of their tongue, by following analogy where that pracice acually deviates from it. Thus, a little boy, being asked how he came by his play thing, said his father buyed it for hitm.

Living languages, if they do not improve, are disposed to decline, and are not secured from change, even by the written mvnuments, which preserve to succeeding ages the records or productions of those who preceded them.

The sacred text of religious inflruction; favourite and popular 
compositions of genius, like those of Homer in Greece, and Shakespear in England, have a tendency to arrest the fleeting nature of language, but do not, as was formerly experienced in some ofthele instances, and is now felt in the others, secure it from change.

The use of writing, which extends the communications of 
men to any distance of place or time, though not universal, like.
speech, has been frequent, and even common.

Words appear to have had as many original frocks, as there 
were separate hordes or Societies of men: But, the invention of writing was original perhaps only to a few ; or, in other 
terns,

PART I. terms, it appears that men have rather copied their written chaacers from the model of a few original inventions.


In all the nations of Europe, whether antient or modern, there 
is rome analogy in the form of letters; frill more in the order of the alphabet, in the found of vowels, and in the power of consonants: But, when we look abroad into the world at large *,
there is reason to believe, that, although writing has been more rarely invented than speech, yet here too the invention has been separately made, and often repeated.

In this, as in the language of speech, we find continued esseas of man's wonderful talent for the use and interpretation of signs. In one nation, the written character is the sign of a word;
insomuch that the linguist, in learning to write the words which he learned in his infancy to speak, finds that his labour is more than doubled.

In other instances, and indeed with mankind in general, the 
written charader is not the sign of a subjed, or of its name, but the mark of a simple found, or of some modification, such as we term vowels and consonants, in the conftrudion of an alphabet.
As these may be reduced to a few, they are easily learnt; and, as their combinations may be varied indefinitely, they are sufficient to spell any number of words that compose a language. The first mode of writing, by using a separate sign for every separate word, is the more obvious invention: The second, confifling in the formation of an alphabet, though setting out at a point more remote from its end, is in fad more easily learned, and more effedual to its purpose.

nation to live in society, and even to render this society in some -v refpets universal. The multiplicity of languages, indeed, tend to form a boundary between separate societies or hordes, and to retard the progress of unprofitable coalition or enlargement of empire. These boundaries, however, as we have observed, do not prevent the most extensive intercourse of nations. Discoveries of science, models of invention, or attainments of genius, whereever they may have originated, find their way to the world, and become a property of mankind. The fame individual is able to marter the separate dialects of many different nations, and retain the knowledge of what has ceased to be spoken for many ages past: So that difference of language is but a feeble bar to the inquifitive genius of i±an.

In this species, the communication extends from nation to nation, and from age to age, at any indefinite distance of place or time; and the society, or co-operations of men may be conceived as extended accordingly. The present age is perfeting what a former age began; or is now beginning what a future age is to perfec. So that, in estimating the social disposition, and cooperating powers of mankind, we can no longer abide by the mere line of analogy, in which we have so far pursued their description, and that of the other animals together. The subjeCt is, in the sequel, likely to furnish more topics of contrast of man to the animals, than of correspondence or similitude.

But there is a principle, in refpet to which man differs from 
the other animals, not only in measure or degree, but totally, and in kind. This principle we term his intelligence or mind, intimately conscious of itself, as it exits in thought, discernment, and will.

a With 
With refped to this principle, the observer may chute whether PART I.

he will collec the external appearances that result from it, or the SAT. V
operations themsel-ves, in which its mode of existence confiifs.

Fads, that relate to the first, constitute a history of the Species,

as it may be obferved;by any indifferent fpedator: Fads, that relate to the second, constitute a history of Mind, as it may be kniown to itself in the cafe of any individual. Both are essential to the knowledge of human nature, and to the Statement of its diftindion in the fyitem of life.

The animals, for ought we know, might be supposed to partake in the intelligence of man, if the external effed did not serve to evince his diftindtion. The human species itself might be supposed alike in every age and nation, if we were not admonished, in the variety of their external pursuits and attainments, of the inequalities of which they are susceptible, and of the progress in which they are.engaged.

To know human nature, therefore, we must avail ourselves not 
only of the consciousness or refleAion of a single mind, but, more at large also, of the varieties that are presented in the history of mankind.

Man is in part diftinguiflhed among the animals, as they are 
from one another, by the make of his body, as well as by the course of his life.

While the quadruped has the trunk of his body parallel with 
the ground, and bearing on four supports, man carries from afar the asped of a column creded on a narrow base. Whatever 
Vot.. . G 1,
PART I. be the posture to which he has 'recourse for repose, he is ever CHAP. I.
ready, for the purpose of motion, obServation, expression, or ac-v'0v tion of any fort, to raise himself on end; and is furnished with articulations and muscles to assume this posture, and to retain it with ease and safety.

He alone, of all the animals, exhibits the diftincdion of hand 
and foot: The first an instrument of art, a weapon of defence, and an organ of exprefflon; the other fitly lhaped for a base on which he may stand, or with which he may pracife the ftep that protrudes him along in his walk. Other animals are either four-footed or four-handed, according as they are deffined to tread upon the ground, or, subsisting in woods, to climb aloft on the branches of trees, from which they are to gather their food.

Next to the general aspet and carriage of the person, the form 
and capacity of the head and countenance give its most confpicuous diftindion to the human figure. A dome, comparatively larger and more capacious than the skull of any other animal, is raised over the features of the countenance, in which are collected many organs of perception or expression, that conneA immediately with the feelings and operations of mind.

Instead of the muzzle, or snout, projecing forward into a fpecies of forceps or pincers, which distinguish the brute, the corresponding parts, in the human figure, are retired among the seatures of the countenance; become an organ of speech; or, next to the eye itself, have the molt powerful effed in the silent exprefsion which often results from the general state of the features.

This difference of aspec is till clearly retained in all the varieties of the human race. These, however different from one another,

ther, in itatute, complexion, or features, are till, in their persons, PART I.
diftinguifnable from the. other animals, which, in the flow gra- CHAC. I.
dations of nature, seem to approach them the most. v 
To this peculiarity of aspeA and form, on the part of man, is 
joined a decided superiority of condition and power. Compared to the other animals, he is every where the Lord among his vasfals, and the master among his slaves; or, where any species remains untamed, and disposed to dispute his ascendant, the contest in fa& isunequal, or the balance, by some evident advantage of superior resource and contrivance, ever inclines to his fide.

In this man is not favoured by any original advantage of ftature, strength, weapon, or larger provision for the supply of his animal wants. On the contrary, in all these refpecs, he labours under great measures of apparent comparative defect.

The animals, in general, are either of a constitution fit to partake, without inconvenience, in the temperature of the medium or element in which they are placed; or, they are furnished with a covering of plumage or fur, to resist the sudden or the extreme viciflitudes of heat and cold. As they have their peculiar talks to perform, their food to provide, their prey to subdue, or enemies to encounter, they are furnished with fit infiruments for labour, with limbs for the chafe, or weapons for the battle.
They have their specific initinCs, to direc them in the choice of materials for food, and of retreats for flelter; and are provided for safety, whether by resistance or flight.

In this distribution of favours, it is remarkable that man alone,

of all the larger animals, is naked, unarmed, and unprovided againft the peculiar inconveniences of any situation or climate.

G 2 In 
PART I. In comparison with many other animals, he is too weak for reiitance, and too flow for flight; even on the earth, which he inSECT. V.
k-Oyv habits, he is perhaps no where pofeffied of a foil, which fpontaneoufly yields a sufficient produce of herbage or fruit for his maintenance; and he himself, in the first attempts to provide a supply, is liable to mirtake the species that is fit for his nourishment.

Such are the apparent comparative defecAs in the original lot 
and description of man: But nature has not left this superior part of her works without compensation. If ihe has given to the other animals plumage, furs, and weapons; if The has inspired them with inftindts conducive to their safety; if lhe has spread forth the board on which they are to feed, and, in the midst of plenty, taught every species to fele- what is proper for itself;
The has proportionally restrained their freedom, and stinted their talents for observation, invention, or progreflion, in the execution of their works.

To man, the faculties of observation or choice are given, as an 
ample equivalent for every other advantage; and every aAual supply is withheld from-him, not through a penury in the ceconomy of nature, or a defec of resource, but as a privation proper to the lot of a being, who is fitted to accommodate himself;
destined to be the artificer of his own fortune, to cultivate his own faculties; and, though of a class superior to any of the other animals, destined to receive the first lessons of intelligence itself,
in providing a supply for the comparative wants and defecs of his animal nature.

Every other animal, from the first outset of the species and the individual, is equal to his tafl; proceeds, in the florteft way, to 
the 
the attainment of his purpose; and neither mistakes the end, nor PART I.
the means by which it is to be obtained. SECT.V.

In what he performs, we often juifly admire the ingenuity of 
contrivance, and the completeness of the work: But, it is theingenuity of the species, not of the individual; or rather, it is the wisdom of God, not the deliberate effect of invention or choice,
which the created being is fitted to employ for himself. His task is prescribed, and his manner of performing it secured.

If we should compare individuals together, in order to measure their inequalities of capacity or genius; if we should compare what the beginning practitioner or novice performs, with that which is done by the aged or experienced, in order to remark the progress of Ikill and address; if we should compare the productions of one age or generation with those of a former, aster many years of experience are past; we should find, in every species of animal, a nature perfecly fixed and stationary, the fame in the last, as in the first efforts of its living exertions.

Observe the animals most remarkable for a happy choice of materials, and for the curious execution of their works: The bird,
how unvaried in the choice of the matter he employs in the ftructure, or in the situation he has chosen for, his airy or:-neft ! Inseas, most exquisitely artful in the execution, of their little works,
for the accommodation of their swarms, and the lodgement of their stores; how accomplished in their first and least experienced attempts; how uniform and unchanged in the lafl!

Nature appears to have given to the other animals a specific direetion to the means they are to employ, without any rational conception of the end for which they are to employ them. Of 
3 this,

PART I. this, the reverse may be affirmed of man. To him, it should CHAP. I.
SCHATP. f seem that the ends of nature are disclosed, in general principles wag\ of choice or rejecion, which dire& him to the preservation and 
advancement of his own nature; but that the choice of means is left, in a great measure, to his own observation and judgement. Having no other guide but his own experience, he is at firif unskilful and awkward; he even continues to mistake and to err, until he has received his correction from a sense of the wrong he has committed, or the evil he has incurred.

To the mere animal, the Author of nature appears to have 
said, " Such I have made you, and such you shall be, and no " more:" To man, " I have given you intelligence and freedom;
" I have not set bounds to what you may attain, in the proper " use of your faculties; and, as the good you attain ihall be your " own, so, for the talent you misplace, you must be account" able."

Such is the fum of that diftincion, which subsists betwixt 
man and the other animals; a diftindion which it is of great consequence to retain in our thoughts, at every ftep of the argument relating to him.

The human body, in its fairest and most accomplished form,

becomes ghastly and hideous, when the energy of life is withdrawn; and the living aspec itself would be odious, were the happy expressions of benevolence and candour changed into indications of brutality and malice. We may therefore be ready to admit, that even the rahoo is not an overcharged description of an ungoverned brute in the ihape of man.

A human creature, less furnished than any other animal with 
determinate inftints, without the guidance of reason to supply their place, without felecion in the object, or bounds in the gratification of his appetite, without candour or remorse in the conduct of his competitions or resentments, would be a monster too odious for nature to endure. So that writers who suppose man originally bereft of intelligence, and yet place him on a level with the brutes, have, in reality, given to this creature of their own imagination a rank, in the scale of being, higher than that to which he would be entitled *.

Intelligence, indeed, in its outset, consisting in mere capacity,

but without the attainments it is fitted to make, would ill £upply the defec of inftinA: And man, in the supposed nascent state of his faculties, without knowledge, which is the result of obfervation and study; without address or dexterity, which is the result of pracice and habit; without itrength of mind or of body,
which is the result of exercise, as well as original power; might appear on a level below that of the animal kingdom.

PART. I. But, though so much inferior, in his earliest efforts, yet when he CHAP. i.
SEC. 'V. has moved for a little in the traa to which he is destined, and has 
made trial of his faculties, he soon leaves every animal behind in the variety and extent of his operations, and in the measure of the supply or fitness of the accommodation which he procures for himself. He is indeed able to subsist, or to drag a precarious life, even in his rudest Itate: But he is so far from being ftationary, in this or any other condition, that, after many ages of progrefs, he must either continue to advance, or is exposed to decline: And, though relieved -of much inconvenience, even after he has attained to what at a distance appeared to be the summit of his fortune, he is in reality only come to a point, at which new objeEts are presented to entice his pursuits, and towards which he-is urged with the spurs of ambition, while those of necessity are no longer applied. Or, if the desire of any thing better than the present hfould at any time cease to operate in his mind, he becomes liffefs and negligent, loses the advantages he had gained,
whether of possession or skill, and declines in his fortune, till a sense of his own defets and his sufferings restore his induitry.

As the other animals are leTs able to vary their modes of living,

they are limited proportionally to the climates and situations in which they are qualified to subsist. The chamois, or mountain roe does not descend into the plain ; amphibious animals do not depart from the shore; nor the falcon and eagle cease to haunt the highest part of the cliff: Such as are indigenous to the torrid or the frigid zone, do not willingly firay into the temperate climates on either fide. Man alone appears to be indigenous in every situation and climate, enjoying an extent of range suited to his freedom of choice, and his ability to lodge and accommodate himsel f.

as the inconveniences he has occasion to remove; the advantages SECT. V.
he has occasion to gain, with the expedients he has occasion to _
praaife, are various, or never precisely the fame, in any two situations; he-muft ever vary his pursuits, and accommodate his manner of life to the exigency of his cafe. In maritime fituations, accordingly, he is a mariner and a fisherman; within land,
he is a hunter, a herdsman, or a labourer of the ground.

In all these professions, he has an immediate view to the supply 
or accommodation of animal life: But, among the arts which he praaifes, or the forms he assets, there are some of which a spectator, unacquainted with what passes in the mind of man, never could comprehend the purpose or the use. In the ftrudure of his dwelling, in the fafllion of his cloaths, in the service of his table, the necessary or useful alone does not content him; he asseas no less than the gratifications of fancy, in decoration and ornament. He works for the eye, the imagination, and the underftanding, no less than for the supply of his animal wants; and his stores are replenished with produdions executed in a combination of forms, or signs of expression; from which he alone, of all the animal kingdom, can receive any gratification or benefit.

Among the fabrics of great labour and cost, there are some on 
which he is willing to expend his utmost resources, but which are neither habitations in which he may dwell, nor fortresses in which he may consult his safety; but edifices dedicated to invifible beings, of which he alone, of all the animals, perceives the existence in any phenomena of nature, whether ordinary or uncommon.

own nature so various, and, upon any principle of mere animal life, so unaccountable, that, to men who observe one another, their different practices appear altogether irrational, and often profane. *

As nature seems to try the ingenuity of man, in a variety of 
problems, and to provide that the species, in different countries,
fhlall not find any two situations precisely alike; so the generations that succeed one another, in the fame country, are, in the result of their own operations, or the operations of those that went before them, ever made to enter upon scenes continually varied. The inventions of one age prepare a new situation for the age that succeeds ; and, as the scene is ever changing, the actors proceed to change their pursuits and their manners, and to adapt their inventions to the circumstances in which they are placed.

Men of one generation naked in the woods, and fubfi{ting on 
herbage and fruits, appear weak or defenceless, and only fit to become a prey to some other animals more fierce than themselves:
But, in a few generations, many of there defects are supplied;
and those we term savages, clothed in the fiin of the beasts they have slain, and armed with the club or the bow, become themselves animals of prey; or, by their arts and inventions, dangerous to those that originally surpassed them in fierceness or firength. Learning to distrust the precarious supply of the chace, they become, in the sequel, keepers of herds, which they zend with anxious care to their paflure; and they may be traced

In the progress of this versatile being to improve his condition,

the fur is exchanged for a web of his own manufacture; his utenfils and his furniture multiply; become too unwieldy for carriage, and too precious to be left behind. The tent is exchanged for a cottage; the labourer acquires an interest in the field he has cultivated, or is made to feel the concerns of the husbandman or the citizen; and relies on the produce of his land, and on his skill to fabricate rude materials, for the means of his subfiftence or accommodation.

Anxious to reproduce what his necessities have made him to;

consume; anxious to secure, in the form of property, what he has procured by his labour; fiudious of ornament, as well as use, in the work he performs, whether in the culture of his fields, in the form of his habitation, or in the equipage of his person; his habits keep pace with his manner of life: and, neither in his condition, nor in the description of his person, any marks remain of that rude or defenceless itate, in which the fpecies may have set out on its progress.

From all these varieties, whether of art, or of the purpose for 
which arts are pracifed, without explicitely stating to ourselves the difference of effec to be apprehended from change of opinion,
or freedom of choice, on the one hand, or of determinate insin3
on the other, we reason differently of man and the other animals:
We expect variety in the separate nations of men, and uniformity in animals of the fame species: We seem to think it impofliblc that the manners of men, in any two situations, fihuld be alike; or, that animals of the fame ficcies fllould any where 


PART I. differ. The grouse in America, we are told, perch upon trees; the are burrows in the ground; and we have, in these instances,
SECr. V.
_v>r '£sufficient reason to deny that the species of either is the fame 
with those of a like denomination, with which we are acquainted, in Europe. But if an American tribe -1hould, in their manners, practice of life, or religious ceremonies, have resemblance to a nation of the antient world, we infer some previous communication, or even think ourselves warranted to conclude, that the one must have been peopled from the other *; and are as much puzzled to account for uniformity in the different ages and nations of men, as we should be to account for variety in fpecimens of the fame animal.

Such, then, are a few of the external appearances, in which the 
human species is distinguished from other parts of the animal kingdom: If we would pursue these appearances to the difference of nature from which they proceed, it will be necellary to attend to the mind itself, from whose capacity of wisdom or folly,
these diversities of pursuit and attainment, or of error and miftake, will be found to arise.

From the mere difference of result, on the part of man, compared with the other animals, an important diftindion of nature may be assumed. This we commonly express in the terms, Reason and InfiinA. But the line of separation here pointed out is far from being clearly marked in every instance.

If, by Inflinct, we mean a propensity or disposition inspired by 
the Author of nature, of such there are many also in the frame or constitution of man: Even Reason itself is a faculty, which we derive in this manner from the Author of our being.

The brutes are directed by their inftinds to the use of means,

prior to any knowledge of the end. Man is direded by his propenfity to an end, whether of preservation or advancement, and qualified to observe, and to choose for himself the means of obtaining that end. Hence the uniformity of works performed by individuals of the fame species of animal, and continued from the first to the last generation in each: And hence the indefinite variety of materials, and manner of execution employed by men in pursuit of the fame objecs.

C H A P. II.
OF MIND, OR THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTELLIGENCE.

S E C T IO N I.

7To limit our observations of human nature to the mere ex- PART. I.
ternal effeAs of intelligence, were to contemplate a figure only CHAP. I.
in the ihadow it caits, while we have the fubflance itself in pof- w session, and under our view. However ungracious, therefore,
the office may be, to those who are accustomed to look only abroad for fubjecs of thought, it is necessary that we turn the sense inward, upon the mind itself, in order to lay open the foundations of power and choice, in which we are so deeply concerned.

a~I~~~ Mind 
PART I. Mind is conscious of itself, and on this ground may proceed to recolled and study its own nature. The objeds of consciousSECT. I.
VJ>^_ ness and refletion are like those of perception and observation 
upon any other subjed, matters of fat, and articles of natural history.

In the hiflory of mind, no less than in that of any other natural subjet, we have a multiplicity and succession of particular operations, which may be diftinguilhed with refpea to their differences, and classed in refped to their agreements and refemblance. By such arrangements, they are placed in a comprehenhenfible order, and under generic or specific names, are familiar]y treated, as matter of recolleCtion or argument.

By the laws ofapprehenfion, to which we are fubjeded, every 
operation is referred to a faculty, of which it is supposed the exertion; and every faculty is referred to a substance, of which it is conceived to be a quality.

So nature has determined, with refpeca to our apprehension of things.

Operations of mind are, in some instances, so like one another, that we not only refer them to the fame faculty, but confider them as repetitions of the fame operation. They are, in other instances, so different, that we think it necessary to admit in the performance of them, faculties totally diftinc.

In the fame manner, also, we reason of qualities, and apprehend fibflances to be the fame or different, according to the asfinity and difcrcpancy of the qualities by which they are known.

3 Body 
Body is known by its solidity, or impenetrability, by its iner- PaART .

CRAP. if.

tia or resistance to change of state, and, we may add, by its SECT. I.
weight also. Mind is known by its consciousness, by its con- H
ception of objets, and by its will.

It is natural to distinguish between the substances, of which the 
qualities are so much unlike; and, if this diftintion be wellfounded, it must appear nugatory, afterwards, in the way of explanation or theory,, to resolve 'operations of mind into qualities of matter, whether figure or motion.

That we may reason of substance, without taking any particular qualities into our account, is evident from the familiar use of the abftraet term substance, itself; but, we are so far from conceiving substance absolutely divested of every quality, that the mention of it brings the sense of an impossibility, which we accordingly never attempt to realize in our thoughts.

As we cannot conceive or imagine fubltances existing without 
fbme quality, so we are apt to attach to every substance the qualities with which we are most familiar. Thus, extension, juxtaposition of parts, and solid dimension, the qualities most commonly perceived by our senses, recur in our conceptions of every existent nature: Insomuch, that fubjeas known to us, by qualities entirely different from these, are, nevertheless supposed to be invested with these qualities also, as essential to their be*
ing.

It is thus, that, while mind is known only by its qualities of 
thought and sentiment, we think necessary to afcribc to it also di:nenfon and place. But, if in mind, over and above its own 
VOL. I. I qualities 
PART. I. qualities of apprehension and will, are to be conceived those of body also, we do not know its corporeal qualities so well, as to W-oo give them a place in its description or history. The microscope 
has not yet made us acquainted with the ftrudture of its parts.
Thoughts multiply, and knowledge extends, without any increase of bulk or change of place or figure.

At the fame time, we may be satisfied, that, although some fort 
of materialism intrude on our conceptions, it is not necessary. that mind should have the qualities of body, in order to exist. The well known substances of light, heat, and all the powers that operate in the attracion of bodies, whether gravitation, magnetism, or electricity, exist without dimension, solidity, or impenetrability. They penetrate space however occupied by the molt solid bodies. They are themselves also freely penetrated, make no resistance, and give no addition of weight. So light, in particular, though in motion with the most amazing velocity, does not impel any body in its way: In refpeat to transparent bodies,
it penetrates the solid, as it does empty space. Heat, as it penetrates, without diftindion, the hardest and most impervious of bodies, is comprised in their substance, without making any addition to their weight. Gravitation, magnetifin, and electricity,
are not intercepted by the moit solid partitions. To electricity,
indeed, different bodies are unequally pervious. And, in the act of repulsion, we may conceive both electricity and magnetifin,
like a fluid stream to impel the bodies which are placed in their way: But this will not explain their attractive power; and is altogether inconsistent with what is observed of gravitation, in particular; which, though at a great distance from the point to which it is directed, operates on bodies in motion, the fame as on bodies at reft, and continues to give equal increments of motion,

when 
when the velocity is greatest, as it did when the body first began PART I.


to move. SECT. I.

It is by no means intended to state the substance of light, heat,

or accelerating, and retarding power, as of the fame nature with mind. They may indeed be the operations of mind, although we know not of any mental quality they exhibit, farther than that the apparent design is regular and beneficent. But, confidering their well known existence, diflinguifhed as they are from inert and impenetrable matter, we must be cautious in supposing that substance and body are equivalent terms; or that, wherever there is motion of a body inert, there must be an impulse of some other body to produce it.

The vulgar do not question the reality of what they perceive 
by their senses; and, in ascribing reality to mind, conceive it in some form of vapour or floating dust: But they ought surely to acknowledge the existence of sensation itself, as more evident than that of matter which is felt, and which, at a kind of second hand, is known only by means of sensations; and they ought to confider mind itself as, of all beings known to them, the molt certain and real. Its opposite conditions of happiness or misery are indeed the ends to which they refer, in effimating the value or consequence of every thing else.

Mind is sufficiently known by its capacity of knowledge, of 
enjoyment, or suffering; and, it will not asseC our proceeding in any future inquiry concerning it, whether we confider thefy as existing in a substance peculiar to themselves, or as the appurtenances of extended matter, supposed thin, fubtilc, or voluble, for the purpose.

to attempt resolving the operations of one faculty into those of another: If sensations and judgements, felf-love and social asfedion, are distinguished, it were abfird, afterwards to account for judgement, by fippofing it sensation, or to account for benevolence, by supposing it to be mere self love.

The mind being defined to know and to ad, the most general arrangement of its powers is that of understanding and will,
or, in the words of Mr Hobbes, " The powers cognitive and the powers ahive."

Under the first, are included all the operations which terminate in apprehension or knowledge.

which terminate in will.

S E C T IO N II.

Of Knowledge in general.

PART I. AMONG the charaaeriftics of mind, knowledge is one of the  first and most important. Confidered as information of the ends  are to pursue, and the means we are to employ in obtaining 
them, it is to man, where mere inftint is wanting, the sole diredtion under which he is to at.

The animals, uninftruced, unexperienced, and previous to any opportunities of observation, aim at their purpose with the most unerring direction, and obtain it by the most effectual means. Thus, the bee is no sooner let loose from the cell in which he is generated, than he joins the infant swarm, in its feparation from the parent flock: Bent on fettling a new colony,
this unexperienced multitude fix in some hollow trunk, or covered flation, fit for their reception; and, having a home, rally from thence, in search of materials for the construction of cells, which they form and arrange together upon the most exquisite model,
replenifl with honey, and, in the result, are lodged and supplied with store of provision for a winter, of which they have not yet had any experience. They do not susser for want of knowledge in their first attempts, nor do they profit by experience in a fucceflion of years : They neither stand in need of information at the outfct, nor avail thcmfclves of it in the fequcel; and we are 
3 therefore 
therefore warranted to conclude, that knowledge is not the principle or guide under which they are destined to aa. PART I.




But man, although, in some inflances, he may be found to aat _v'

in the manner of a mere animal, yet, in most inisances, he proceeds upon his knowledge of an end, and upon his choice of means for the attainment of it: He sometimes ats upon the conception of an object that is absent or future, in preference to one that is present to his senses. To him, therefore, knowledge,
or a just conception of things, is the first and most necessary qualification of his a&ive, as well as intelligent nature.

Whoever has lived but a few years knows that time palres in 
the vicissitudes of day and night, of summer and winter; but he cannot define knowledge, nor tell what it is to know, any more than he can tell what it is for the mind to exist.

Our conceptions of things are termed, in a language now become familiar and common, our ideas of them; and ideas are supposed to be images, types, or copies, resembling certain originals ; not mere notions or thoughts of ours forming the apprehenfion or knowledge of such originals.

It is difficult for us to quit the analogy of matter, with which 
we become so familiar, in the firit and continued use of our fenfes: In every language, accordingly, the operations of mind have been exprefled in corporeal image, or metaphor: Our notions or conceptions of things are termed impreflions or images; and the analogy, upon which such metaphors are founded is sometimes mittaken for identity, or sameness, in the natures so confounded together in metaphorical language.

One 
PART .I One fe of the antient philosophers chose to forget the qua
lity of mere rhetorical figure, under which such exprefflons are t'^Y%/ used; and treated the notion, or mental apprehension, as an image or picure of the thing, in the most literal sense.

Such were the images, or little models of things, which, according to Democritus, and Epicurus, were continually flying off from their substances; floating in space; entering the organs of animals; and, by their assemblage in the brain, producing all the modifications of sensation, thought and volition.

Nunc agere incipiam tibi, quod vebementer ad has res Attinet, efe ea qztea reruwznimtuilacra vocamus,

iuie quasi membrane fimmo de corpore rerum Dirept, volitant ultro citroque per auras.

Luc. lib. 3. ver. 33.

And Cicero, in flating this Epicurean hypothesis, has the following words: " Imagines quae idola nominant quorum incur" sone non solum videamus, fed etiam cogitemus."

Definibus, lib. I. c. 6.

According to this fyfjem, the thoughts and conceptions, of 
which the mind is conscious, are in reality a mere collection of little images, obtruded upon it from abroad.

A similar language has been adopted in modern times, and 
repeatcd without sufficient intimation whether it be meant in a figurative or literal sense. Thus, Mr Hobbes, so prone to materialifin, and to the use of corporeal images, has led the way, and bccn followed with little variation, though perhaps with more

refpeac to the diftintion between mind and matter, by Des Car, PART. I.
tes, Malebranche, Locke, and others. CHAP. I.



These authors. differ somewhat in the methods they have puruied; but all agree, in refting their theories on the substitution of images, or, as they term them, ideas, for the simple apprehension of things.

In this train Hobbes Lets out with the following assumption,

which he seems to think so evident, as not to need any proof:
"We must remember and acknowledge," he Lays, "that there be " in our minds continually certain images or conceptions of "things without us. Insomuch that, if a man could be alive,
" and all the reft of the world annihilated, he mould, neverthe" less retain the image thereof, and all those which he had before " een or perceived in it."

Upon this hypothesis, the phenomena of memory and imagination, according to him, are fully explicable; -" for, as the motion " of the water," he fays, "continues after the flone struck in it, or " the wind by which it is agitated, has ceased; so these images " continue in the mind, after the external cause is removed, and " are termed Memory."

So far there appears to be little difference between the images 
of Hobbes and the idole orJimulacra of Democritus and Epicurus.
Others have exchanged the term image for that of idea, a term borrowed from Plato, but in which he exprefecd not any particular perception or apprclienfion; but the standard model or conception of genus or species, (the one in many ":), after 
VOL. I. K which

In common language, our idea of a subjet is the fame as our 
notion or conception of it: But Mr Locke frequently seems to intend something different from this, as, when he states that we cannot have knowledge, where we have not ideas. This is undoubtedly true; but, if idea mean the fame thing as notion, it were certainly nugatory to observe, that we cannot have knowledge of a subj ed, if we have not any notion of it.

The substitution of corporeal for mental attributes, with a view 
to explain the latter, is curiously exemplified in the following passage translated from Malebranche: " We are accustomed," he fays, " to diftinguifll in the mind two faculties, Understanding " and Will. These we mufft explain in the outset; for, it does not ' appear that our notions or ideas of them are sufficiently clear " and diftin& : But, because there ideas are abftradt, and do not " enter into the imagination, it seems proper to express them un' der some image of the properties that belong to matter, which "being easily imagined, will render the meaning of there terms,
"Underltanding and Will, more diftinc, and even more fami"liar." After some caution, not to think the mental and corporeal qualities the fame, this author proceeds to observe, " that,
" as bodies are susceptible of figure and motion, fb mind is sus" ccptible of ideas and dispositions. The first," he fays, " are its " figure ; the other its motions," &c. &c.

Thele 
These allegorical substitutions are not mentioned with a view PART I.
to pursue their applications, or to take any benefit from the fact- CHAP. I



lity they are supposed to give in the study of the mind. It were, <v indeed, difficult to conceive what benefit they should yield; if, on the pretence of explaining a subjet, they only divert the attention away from it, or substitute some what else in its place.

Mr Hobbes, as well as Mr Locke, have expressed many just observations in their metaphorical language of images or ideas;
particularly in what the one calls the coherence of thoughts, the other the association of ideas. But, to profit by these obfervations, we must remember that the fat is not any magical coherence, or aflociation of thoughts, but a habit or disposition of the mind in us, to conceive together things which have been presented together.

The author of an Enquiry into the Mind, * and of subsequent 
Essays on the intellectual and aceive powers of man, has great merit in the effect to which he has pursued this history: But,
confidering the point at which the science flood, when he began his inquiries, he has perhaps no less merit in having removed the mist of hypothesis and metaphor, with which the subject was enveloped; and, in having taught us to state the fads, of which we are conscious, not in figurative language, but in the terms which are proper to the subjet. In this it will be our advantage to follow him; the more, that in former theories so much attention had been paid to the introducion of ideas or images, as the elements of knowledge, that the belief of any external existence or prototpye has been left to be inferred from the mere idea or image; and this inference indeed is so little founded, that many who have come to examine its cvidence have thought themselves warranted to deny 
K 2it * Dr Rcid.

PART I. it altogether *. And hence the scepticism of ingenious men, who CS PIIA. not feeing a proper access to knowledge, through the medium of 
Wesvu ideas, without confidering whether the road they had been directed to take was the true, or a false one, denied the possibility of arriving at the end.

The reality of knowledge, nevertheless, however little to be explained by any corporeal analogy, may be safely afiumed, and the faAs which relate to the attainment of it, be confidered as an important part in the history of mind.

There was little progress of knowledge, so long as men of ingenuity supposed science to consist in explaining the primary facts of which nature has given us the use, but not the theory: Such, in the material system of nature, are the laws of gravitation and motion. It was vain to think of explaining them; but, so soon as they were confidered as fundamental in nature, to be confidered, not in refpeA to their origin, but in refpet to their applications and consequences, science has made a rapid progress in explaining the phenomena of that system in which they prevail.

In the following method, it is proposed to invefligate and to 
apply, not to explain, the laws of conception and will: To confider them, as they are verified in the description of human nature; in order to lay open to our recolletion, as much as may be,
the foundations of power and choice, and to delineate the superllrudlure that may be raised upon there foundations.

Of the ACtual Sources of Knowledge, and Mvcafures of Evidence.
TH E sources of knowledge may be referred to four titles, viz. PART. I.


Consciousness, Perception, Testimony, and Inference. 

The two first may be termed primary or immediate, because 
from them we receive the first elements of our conception, and obtain information by immediate recourse to the subjed of knowledge.

In the third and fourth instances, knowledge may be termed 
derived or secondary, because it is obtained by some medium interpofed, or by means different from that of mere attention to the subjec itself.

If the original sources of information were fihut up, the knowledge they are fitted to yield, could not be supplied in any other way: If a person, for intfance, were not himself conscious of a given passion or affeCion, whether fear or love, he could not have any conception of such mental qualities; and, it is well known, that pcrfons having no perception of colour or found, remain through life without any such conceptions; whereas, want of testimony,

2 ffron 
from which to receive information, or want of data, from which 
PART I. to infer it, may be mutually supplied one by the other; if not by 
. more immediate acquaintance with the fubjeet, in personal ob\^\v x servation or perception.

Consciousness is the first and most essential attribute of the 
mind. It is expressed in what the grammarians term the firit personal pronoun 1, or Ego, and is flated in every sentence of which that pronoun is the subjet. In multiplying such fentences, the conscious mind seems to give an account of itself; and,
in doing so, may either enumerate particulars, or proceed to generalize, investigating the laws of its own nature, in a process perfectly similar to what is followed in treating any other subjeA ofobfervation, of history, or science.

Mind, confidered in refpea to its powers of communication or 
expreflion is a subjeA of those sciences, which are termed grammar and rhetoric. Confidered in refpei& to its faculties of perception, inquiry, and discernment of truth, it is the subjed of logic: Confidered in respect to the principles of choice, its difcernment of good and evil, and its capacity of enjoyment and ftffering, it is the subjeA of moral wisdom: And, when articles of all these different kinds are colleced merely as charaaeriftics of its nature, it is the subjec of pneumatology, or the defcription and natural history of mind.

The knowledge obtained by reflecion, from consciousness, is,

of all others, the most intimate and sure. It consists in a conviction of reality that sets every cavil and dispute at defiance, or does not admit of a question, whether that of which we are confcious may not be otherwise than as we are conscious of it : In other matters, even in matters of perception, there is an informa.3 ttion,

thought or affeAcion, and the consciousness of thought or affection, vare inseparable. Here the evidence of reality remains unfkaken and unattempted by the boldest assaults of scepticism. The very statement of doubt is a dogmatic assumption of personal existence and thought.

In metaphysics, or mathematics, are flated some axioms, of 
which the truth is not only real but necessary; and in this they differ from the fads of which we are conscious, which, however irrefragably eltablifhed by that evidence, are in the nature of things contingent, or might have been otherwise.

In the mean time, it may be questioned, whether many, if not 
all the axioms having the evidence of necessary truth, be not some species of disguised tautology, in which a fubje& repeated in the form of a predicate is affirmed of itself. Thus the tautological axiom of whatever is is, may be disguised in the following expreflions: It is impossible for the fame thing to be and not to be. Of contradiEory propositions, the one mugs be true, the otherfal'e. Things equal to thefame thing muff be equal to one another. Take equal things from equal things, the remainders vwill be equal. To there we may join the axiom, That every effect muff have a cause: For we affirm in the predicate no more than what we assume in the fubje&c,-That an effect, which ever implies some one thing that is produced by another, is so produced. Change the term to exiftence, and it is not equally necessary that every existence flhould have a cause prior to itself.

In perception,we have cognizance of objects diflint or apartfrom olrfclves, and learn that we arc but a part in the system of nature.

We 
PART. I. We perceive in our frame certain animal organs of smell, of 
. tafe, hearing, feeing, and touch, which being sensibly affeced,
krv'\X give the perceptions of external objects.

The whole of any one objet is not originally perceivable by 
the sensation of any one organ, although in the sequel of our experience, we need no more to inform us of an object than some one of the perceptions by which it is known. Although we neither finell, taste, hear, or fee the solid dimension of a body, yet,
having examined by the touch what we smell, tafle, hear, or fee,
we are from thenceforward, by any one or more of those senses,
apprised of bodies existing in the solid dimensions of length,
breadth, and thickness: We are apprised of a fruit by its smell,
or visible appearance, and know what we flould feel if we touched it. The fubjeEt of a first perception is often traced to a fecond; this to a third, a fourth, and so on, as far as we have any experience or knowledge in the system of nature. Thus, the fragrance of the air in a summer's evening is traced to the exhalation of odours from the woods after a flower; and odour itself is traced to the evaporation of volatile substances that replenifl the air we inspire at the nofirils. A rattling noise is traced to a carriage that is passing in the fireet; and found itself is traced to a tremulous motion produced in the air. Superficial figures having length and breadth, with a certain distribution of light and slade, maybe traced either to a picture on a plain surface, or to the solid dimension of a body placed before any ground that serves to mark its contour. A circle or a triangle, properly fhaded, may be traced either to a piAure on canvass, or to a solid sphere, a cone, or a pyramid, according to the outline within which the distribution of light and slade is made. Polygons fitly diversified with light and slade, may be traced to pitures 
of 
of solids, whether regular or irregular, and under any combi- PART L
nation of surfaces. Solid bodies, indeed, for the most part, may, CHAPT. 1
by the eye, unassisted with any other organ, be diftinguifheed from piaures, however artfully drawn; but, if there should be any doubt, refpe6ing any such visible appearance, the reality of a solid dimension may be fully ascertained by the touch; and,
from the organ of touch, perhaps, it is, that we are enabled to trace the visible appearance of bodies, to solid dimensions of any fort.

Throughout a certain class of objeAs in nature, the feeling, or 
touch, is our surest and last resort for information. As we cannot either smell, taste, nor hear, the solid dimensions of bodies;
a being reftri6ed to the use of these organs would have no conception of extended or impenetrable matter. Body is perceived by the touch to be solid and inert, or resisting to change of state.
What, in refped to one degree of pressure to the touch is hard;
in refpe& to another, is soft: But the ultimate result of perception, in tangible bodies, is, that matter compressed to the utmoef will be extended and exclusively occupy space. And, although some are of opinion, that even solidity itself might be traced to somewhat else, as found is traced to a tremulous motion in the air;
yet, to be entirely unknown, is, in refpecd to us, the fame thing as not to exist *

There are, indeed, fubjeds of perception in nature, which we 
cannot trace even to this ultimate point of reality. Light is perceived by the fight, but not by the touch. Heat is perceived by the touch, but not through the means of its inertia or solid refillance. The attracive powers of gravitation and magnetifin are

Things connected in nature are perceived, or perhaps rather 
inferred, one from another. Their connedion, as Dr Reid has observed, gives to them mutually the effect of signs; and they may be presented in any order one by another: Thus, charcoal and athes are the signs of recent fire, as the flames that rife from combustible substances are the signs of materials about to be reduced to alies. Even corporeal appearances are the signs of mind: The animal frame in man, with many of its funcions,
serves to express the operations of intellectual faculties. Order, or the combination of means in nature to the attainment of ends, is the ign of intelligent power.

In many of these instances, perception approaches to the nature 
of inference, and is rather a derived and secondary than a primary and immediate source of information. The measure of its evidence varies, perhaps even declines in force, as it paies from the first description of a primary source to that of a derived and conjeAural means of information. Even under the firftdefcription the evidence of perception is unequal in different instances.
In some we receive it with caution, and grope our way amidst sensible appearances, that we may not be deceived; in others the evidence of perception is unquestionable. But whether doubtful or certain, it is the only light with which we are furnished towards the discernment of reality in external things: Hence all we know of the earth and the heavens, of the fun, planets, and fixed flars, of the air, the sea, and the land, of minerals, plants,
and animals, of property, of profit and loss, of men and other mens minds, of our country, of superiors, inferiors, or equals,
of friends and firangers, of parent and child, of jufiice or injustice;

A person, indeed, may doubt whether body be such an existence as he apprehends it; but no one who knows the import of his own words, can deny its reality.

Under the highest measures of conviction, which attend our 
perception of external things, truth does not appear to be neceffary; and the reality may be different from the appearance that is perceived by us. What the maxim of wisdom, with refped to perception, may be, we shall have occasion to inquire, in confidering the laws of evidence.

By testimony, we receive information of what others have perceived or known. In this form, we are willing both to give and to receive communication of knowledge. This is a part of our social nature of much importance in this place; and still more where we have occasion to state the moral obligations of faith and veracity, in the dealings and conversations of men.

Great part of what we know is derived from this fburce; as to 
it may be referred all that we learn from books, from history, or conversation. It may be of consequence, however, in rating the value of such information, to observe, that testimony can present us only with new combinations, of which the particulars themselves, or constituent parts, before we can be made to understand the description or enumeration in which they are conveyed, mull have been previously known by confcioufilefs or perception.

Things conneCted in nature are perceived, or perhaps rather 
inferred, one from another. Their connecion, as Dr Reid has observed, gives to them mutually the effet of signs; and they may be presented in any order one by another: Thus, charcoal and alies are the signs of recent fire, as the flames that rife fiom combustible substances are the signs of materials about to be reduced to afles. Even corporeal appearances are the signs of mind: The animal frame in man, with many of its functions,

In many of these inflances, perception approaches to the nature 
of inference, and is rather a derived and Secondary than a primary and immediate source of information. The measure of its evidence varies, perhaps even declines in force, as it palNes from the first deScription of a primary source to that of a derived and conjecural means of information. Even under the first defcription the evidence of perception is unequal in different intfances.
In some we receive it with caution, and grope our way amidst sensible appearances, that we may not be deceived; in others the evidence of perception is unquestionable. But whether doubtful or certain, it is the only light with which we are furnifled towards the discernment of reality in external things: Hence all we know of the earth and the heavens, of the fun, planets, and fixed flars, of the air, the sea, and the land, of minerals, plants,

A person, indeed, may doubt whether body be such an exiffence as he apprehends it; but no one who knows the import of his own words, can deny its reality.

Under the highest measures of convition, which attend our 
perception of external things, truth does not appear to be neceffary; and the reality may be different from the appearance that is perceived by us. What the maxim of wisdom, with refpee to perception, may be, we ihall have occasion to inquire, in confidering the laws of evidence.

By testimony, we receive information of what others have perceived or known. In this form, we are willing both to give and to receive communication of knowledge. This is a part of our social nature of much importance in this place; and still more where we have occasion to state the moral obligations of faith and veracity, in the dealings and conversations of men.

Great part of what we know is derived from this source; as to 
it may be referred all that we learn from books, from history, or conversation. It may be of consequence, however, in rating the value of such information, to observe, that testimony can present us only with new combinations, of which the particulars themselves, or constituent parts, before we can be made to understand the description or enumeration in which they are conveyed, miufi have been previously known by consciousness or perception. The combination may be new, but must consist of particulars alrcaL 2 dy 
PART I. dy conceived. Seas- of milk and flips of amber are objeds SCHA. I.T new and strange: But lea, milk, ship, and amber, muit have 
vrv been previously conceived, to make way for such fictions.

\Wherc the previous conception of elements is wanting, it were vain to think of conveying information of a subjec, by enumerating the particulars of which it is composed. This were to speak in words which are not underifood. The traveller may inform us of a land, mountainous or plain, wooded or clear, flocked with animals of a particular description, inhabited by men of a particular figure, stature, and form: He may even feign any combination of things; but, as his accounts are communicated in words, or in the names of particulars so combined, the meaning, as well as the name must have been previoufly known, for us to conceive the assemblage under which they are presented. This fact is material, and should be attended to in ascribing to their different sources the benefits to be derived from personal observation and experience, on the one hand, ci the fubfequent.enlargement of knowledge that may be derived firom books or information, on the other. A treatise on colour, read to the blind, would to him be void of meaning; or, in search of a meaning, perhaps be referred to some conception of found. Could the deaf be told of found, he would probably recur to some conception of colour or mental affeCtion, of which he is conscious:
And it is thus, probably, that, while we read of fubjedts of which the constituent parts are unknown to us, we substitute somewhat else instead of that to which our reading relates, and, in fad, receive no real or useful information on the subjet. A person, who had never seen troops in the field, will not learn from the Commentaries of Cefar, or the Memoirs of Turenne.

Teflimony, in the courts of law, is a principal source of information, and that on which the title of evidence is Specially be3 flowed;

flowed; insomuch, that the term, witness and evidence, are pro- PART I,
miifcuoufly applied. Even when circumstances are admitted in CScA. II.
proof, those circumstances are taken from the testimony of witneiTes.

We presume the witness to speak truth, as we presume the 
mirror to reflet the image that was cast upon it: But the evidence of testimony is so far inferior to that of perception, as it brings the additional defeCts which lie open to doubt, with refpeEt to the competence of the witness, his capacity ofobfervation,
or his caution to avoid being himself deceived; his veracity, the inducements he may have to deceive, or his ability to refill them.

The terms credible, doubtful, or incredible, teem peculiarly applicable to this species of evidence ; and belief, or disbelief, are its ipecific effets. The circumstances that enforce the credit of a witness, his known veracity, his want of any temptation to depart from it, or his declaration being the reverse of what his temptations would lead him to make, as they carry the evidence of testimony to its highefr measure, may amount in their effect to entire conviction.

Circumstances, that make for or against the credit of a witness, may be so balanced as to make belief hang in fufpence, or circumstances unfavourable to his credit may so preponderate as to quite overthrow it.

Belief and assent, which are due to a credible testimony, express the degree of confidence with which we reft on a probable opinion; but are inadequate to express the effect of confcioul:
ncfs or perception. In these the evidence and conviction are inseparable. Although we may fay that we know a truth, of which 
we 
PART I. we are conscious, or which we perceive; yet, to fay that we are CHAP. IL
conscious of it, or that we perceive it, is enough, and amounts 
,y to conviction or knowledge. Inquiries, therefore, into the cause 
of belief, in matters of consciousness, or evident perception, appear to be misplaced, and only insinuate a question, where nature has refused to admit of a doubt*.

Under the fourth title, or that of inference, there remains to 
be confidered yet another road to the attainment of knowledge. In this we colled, from faas or circumstances previously admitted,
some farther information which would of itself, or otherwise, be wanting.

The fads or circumstances admitted may be founded in confcioufnefs, perception, testimony, or even previous argument;
and are termed the data or premises, while that which is inferred from them, is termed the conclusion: and the evidence will be proportioned to that of the premises, and to the connedion which leads to infer the conclusion. The evidence of inference or argument, therefore, will partake in that of consciousness, perception, or beftimony, according as the premises are derived from one or other of these sources. It will decline as that of the premises declines ; and, even where these are certain, will become doubtful, in proportion as the connedion between the premises and the conclusion may be questioned.

Things are connected in nature as cause and effect, as general and particular, or as ordinary concomitants; and, on these varieties

of things, and left us to collec the reality of an object from thence: She has given us perception; and this is at once a knowledge of its objet.

ties of connetion, inference of various evidence is founded. PART I.
From a given cause we infer an effec; or, from a given effea, 
we infer a cause: From the weight of the atmosphere, we infer v'
what shall be the height of a column of a given fluid in the barometer; or, from that height, at a particular time, we infer the acual pressure or weight of the atmosphere in its state then present.

From a general law of nature, or from a generic description,

we infer the fat in particular instances, or we class individuals under the genera to which they belong. From a sufficient number of faCts, we infer a law of nature; or, from the agreement of many individuals in one set of qualities, we infer or we colle& a generic description.

From one or any part of the circumstances, that are usually 
observed together, we infer the whole; or, from the general appearance of an objet, infer some particular part. The mathematician reasons from his own definition ; the lawyer, from the flatute or pradice of his country; the metaphysician, from his primary conception of being and its attributes ; the physiologist either, by some adequate enumeration of fads, investigates a law of nature, or, to explain a particular phenomenon, applies a law of nature he has previously conceived or eflabliflied.

Of the Laws or Canons of Evidence,

PART II. AMONG the felicities incident to human nature, next to a tem
 per corred and resolute, we may reckon a judgement undifturb_"~v"-' ed in the discernment of truth. These advantages are indeed 
conneced together: The temper is £upported by just conceptions of things; and, if our conceptions are miflaken or embaraffed, we must susser proportionally, in refpeC to every circumflance in the condition of mind.

The proper use of discernment, in relation to what we admit 
as truth, may indeed be confidered as an article of wisdom, and a branch of the moral fceince; but, as we have this interest at flake, no less when we reason than when we ad, it may not be improper to touch upon it in this place, or immediately in the sequel of the fads, now Rfated, refpecing the sources of knowledge.

The errors to which we are cxpofed, in the admiflion or in the rcjcetion of evidence, may be on either extreme, of indifcriminate 
nate credulity, on the one hand, or indiscriminate scepticism on PART I.
the other. With the credulous, every appearance and every re- CHAP. II

every docrine is a subjea of cavil, and the despair of knowledge is substituted for caution in the feleAion of truth.

To guard against the first of these errors, we are to diflinguifh 
what is consistent with the order of nature, and to require, in support of every tenet, the evidence with which it fiould naturally be attended if true.

We are not to believe, upon the attestation of others, what, if 
true, we ourselves ought to be conscious of, or fllould have perceived. We are not to believe, upon the report of one witness,
what, if true, many others ihould be equally ready to attest.

Affecting to secure the foundations of knowledge, some have 
set out with a maxim, that no tenet or faA is to be admitted without evidence. This is undoubtedly true; but the meaning of evidence must be explained before the maxim can be safely applied.

If, by the term evidence, we mean a sufficient cause of knowledge; consciousness and perception are of all others the preferable grounds of assent or conviction: But, if the term evidence be reftriaed to any particular cause of belief, such as testimony,
or argument, the maxim ought to be rejeAed; for many things are to be admitted as true, which cannot receive confirmation either from testimony or argument.

Whatever we are conscious of, or whatever we perceive, has an evidence prior to argument or teflimony; and it is indeed fron

CslP. Iv gument, to infer the moit certain conclusions : But, as testimony .,/-. V has usurped the name of evidence in the courts of law, argument 
or inference has usurped it no less in the discussions of science.
And the maxim, that no proposition is to be received without evidence, is supposed to imply the neceflity of argument in support of every truth.

Hence Des Cartes thought it necessary to slate an argument in 
proof of his own existence, before he would proceed, upon that supposition, to treat of any thing else. This limited application of the term evidence, more than we are apt to imagine, may be the cause of that fcepticifin which disputes the assent, if not to matters of consciousness, at least to those of perception, or any other the most evident facds.

It is obvious, that the force of an argument partly consists in 
the evidence of premises or of truths previously known, or better known than the conclusion inferred from them: And, for this reason, whatever is already equally or better known, than any premises from which we can propose to infer it, cannot be eftablilhed by argument. The sceptic, therefore, who requires argument in support of every assumption, must begin to doubt precisely at the point at which the truth is most certainly known.

It is probably in this limited sense of the term, that the fceptic requires evidence, before he admits the perceptions of sense.
In deciding on the truth of perception, indeed, we have sometimes to examine the informations of one sense by those of another; and, where observation is doubtful, in one or a few inflances, we repeat the fame observation in many, and bring every competent organ of sense to our aid: But, when we have done 
so 
so much, or when our perception is already clear and determi- PART I.
nate, we have no farther resource, and have notariy previous data 


'on which to eftablifll the faith of what.we perceive.

While we admit the maxim, that no information is to be received without the evidence it must have had if true, we muff also admit the converse; that, in matters within our cognisance,
and on which a decision is required of us, information, supported by all the evidence it could have had if true, ought to be sustained as sufficient to command our belief. What we ourselves cannot have perceived rnuft be admitted on the credible report of other: What has not part in the presence of witnesses, must be admitted, or rejected, on the credit of the circumstances which serve to evince or disprove it. To reject such information, were to shut up the mind against the admifion of knowledge, and to rejec the guide which nature had furnished for our direction through life.

Scepticifin, no doubt, by restraining credulity, may guard againft one species of error, but, carried to extreme, would difcourage the search of truth, suspend the progress of knowledge,
and become a species of palsy of all the mental powers, whether of speculation or of acion.

The sceptic, indeed, sometimes affects to diftinguifl the provinces of speculation and of ation. While, in speculation, he questions the evidence of sense ; in practice, he admits it with the most perfect confidence: But speculations in science are finely of little account, if they have not any relation to fubjeds of actual choice and pursuit; and if they do not prepare the mind for the difccrnmcnt of matters, relating to which there is .aiual occasion to decide, and to act, in the conduca of human life.

of the fame fubjets of consciousness, and the fame organs of sense. _rr But there is an article of intelligence subsequent to these in which individuals appear greatly to differ.

We often perceive, and are conscious of things which we susser to escape our observation. This aa of the mind pre-supposes confcioufnefs, perception, or information somehow received ; but is the voluntary ad of a mind intent that nothing shall escape which may gratify curiosity, may be turned to use, or which in any way merits attention.

It is probable that minds differ originally in refped to this 
quality, and that they who have it most, possess intelligence itself in the highest degree, or at least are likely to be most diftinguiflied in the use of their faculties.

As 
PART I. As observation is the first voluntary effort of our diftin&ive na
ture, the defect of it is likely to mar the advantages to be reaped '--V--' from thence :- If we overlook in the objeds around us, the 
circumitances in which they concern us, if we are ignorant of their consequences, and thus unprepared for the scene in which we are destined to act, our lives are likely to be a series of error, folly, and disappointment.

If we overlook the charac6eriftical qualities by which fubjets 
may be distinguished or classed, the world, in refpeet to us, yet remains in a slate of confusion or chaos: If we overlook the more important relations of aAion and paflion, by which parts are combined in the living order of nature, we remain insensible to that magnificent scene which the universe presents, and in the contemplation of which we are deflined to find the highest and most improving exercise of our faculties.

Nature, indeed, has placed in our way many occasions which 
excite observation, however little we may intend.the exercise of our reason in this particular, and however dull and supine we may be in refpedt to matters that do not immediately affecA our senses with pleasure or pain. Few things are so far indifferent to men of ordinary understanding as not in some degree to engage their attention. The perceived importance of any one particular,
leads the observation to whatever is connected with it Even things which areoverlooked when separately presented, will appear str-iking when itated in comparison or contrast one with another.
The multiplicity and resemblance, or variety and diversity, therefore, of objcdts that occur in the iyftem of nature, are powerful incitements to observation and thought.

Whatevcr 
Whatever has a relation to ourselves, whether by its tendency PART 3.



to hurt or to benefit, is an objec of paflion, aversion, or desire, SECT. V.
and can escape observation only from those who are yet unapprifed of its power.

Inadvertence in many is correted only by experience, and they 
are flow of forming any concerted design of observation or of action. Yet man is deflined to at from design, and to anticipate the future from the observation of the past. The part on which he enters is by him previously conceived, however he may susser himself to be diverted from it by incidental occasions. And he is destined to choose, and intentionally to pursue, the means by which he is enabled to accomplish his end. He goes in search of important matter, even where it is not presented to his first observations, and is qualified to conftrua the fabric of knowledge or science refpe&ing his own and other natures, in a form to which casual and unexamined appearances might never have conduded his thoughts.

In the study of visible and mechanical fubjeds men have, in 
latter ages, pursued their observations in the way of experiment,
a name formerly unknown to the world. They have not been contented with observing what nature presents in her ordinary course; they have devised new circumitances, and varied the conjunctures in which the operation to be observed is repeated,
in order that the variety it presents, in different conjundures,
may lead to a discernment of the cause from which it proceeds.
In one experiment, a supposed cause is set to operate by itself,
without any concurring circumflance; in another the cause in queltion is entirely excluded; in order to judge from the effed

PART. I. in one cafe, or the want of effet'in the other, how far the phenomenon to be explained actually proceeds from the cause alSECT. V.
'^v^ leged. Thus, in the experiments of Torricelli and Pafchall,

the pressure of the atmosphere was admitted on the surface of a fluid into which the inverted tube was immersed, or it was excluded; and the experiment was tried with fluids of different specific gravity; from all which it appeared, that the column suspended kept pace with the pressure of the atmosphere, and was such in the different fluids of mercury or water, as that pressure could balance. In such trials as these, the operation of a cause which in the ordinary course of things might have forever remained unobserved, was forced into view, and placed beyond the poflibility of doubt or mistake. The phenomena of fustion were familiarly known, and the pump was conftruted to obtain its effect; but the cause remained in obscurity, until the Torricellian experiments brought it to light. Other branches of science have attained to the most beautiful form through a feries of concerted experiments; such as are exemplified in the theory of light and colour by Newton, of electricity by Franklin,
of chemistry by Black, Lavoisier, and other ingenious men.

This, however, is a method of observation which cannot be 
equally pursued in the study of human nature, or of human affairs, as in certain departments of the material system. No man is so much the matter of his fellow-creatures, as to claim the right of exposing them to the risk of a trial, of which the result may be calamitous or fatal; no one is willing to make such experiments respecting himself. But, in the nature of man,
where the operation of every principle, whether of affedion or paflion is known to every mind, and where the conjunctures in which they acually operate are sufficiently varied in the ordiI nary 
nary course of things, the use of concerted experiment is not e- PART I.


qually necessary. SECT. V.

Men have sufficiently varied their trials on the effet of external accommodations, diversity of manners, and forms of policy. Every one may observe for himself the effec of such variations, whether amounting to happiness or misery. And if he err, it is not want of experience that misleads him; but prefumptive opinions conceived without examination, and suffered to remain even in opposition to the experience he has actually had.

In this matter we have not only to cultivate the powers of observation, but to acquire alto that force of mind which may give to observation its proper effea. There is no objea of human concern on .which the dullest of minds has not already imbibed some opinion; and opinions formed into habits of thinking do not give way even to conviAion. They may be supplanted by a different or contrary habit of thinking; but often Let inftru&ion,
mere information, or even conviction at defiance. Of this we need no other example, than that of a person, who, although he is convinced that all the tales of ghosts and apparitions he ever heard are fabulous, yet trembles in entering.a church yard or burial vault in the dark.

CoYV possession or power of recolleAing what we continue to know of a 
subjed formerly perceived.

Although, under the separate titles of underflanding and of will,

we seem to have adopted a diftindtion that is sufficiently accurate,
so as to have excluded from the one every passion, affection, or acsive propensity, and from the other every aa of apprehension or of conception constituent of mere knowledge; yet, in flating particulars, we are reminded that the operations we enumerate under either title, are not the separate parts of a divided fubje,
but the occasional and often joint operations and funrions of one and the fame intelligent power. The fame mind that assets the poffelion of an object already known, also affects the knowledge of it; and undcrftanding itself, prior to the impulse of any fpccial .aflcCion, is direccd by an aAive propensity, which we term curiofit',v

nature of its object, so memory is an active funtion continuing SECT. VI
to grasp the fubjeds of knowledge. It is modified by a va- r.
riety of original propensities and dispositions. We are dipofeld to retain what we have observed or known. We are disposed to recolled particulars under the fame combination, and in the fame order, in which they we presented. Hence the unity of a subjet, though consisting of many separable parts, is attended in us with unity of conception.

This important law of our nature is, by Mr Hobbes, as we 
have already mentioned, termed the coherence of thoughts, and,
by Mr Locke, the afflciation of ideas. Its phenomena are of mighty consequence, whether in the contemplative or active pursuits of mind. In every aA of contemplation, as in the functions of memory in particular, we are disposed to connedt subjeds together in our thoughts as we have found them conneced in nature, whether by contiguity of time or place, similitude, or the more important relations of cause or effeCt.

Mere contiguity of time or of place is an accidental connection;

but, in passing from one subjet of thought to another, the effea of it can never be resifted, even by those who are apprized of the other and more important relation of fubjeAs.

The presentment of any one thing revives the memory of many others which are in any way connected with it. The fight of an acquaintance recals the scene of our familiarity, or the scene recals the acquaintance; and we are told of persons, who,

N being 
PART I. being furnished with a leading expreflion or sentence in a page they CEHP.I . had read, could, from the mere contiguity of words in a passage SECT.VI.
>/vw of any length, repeat the whole, This is to have things by rote,

without any understanding or comprehension of their nature. It is a talent, however, which may be turned to account, and is to be valued as we value the poffeflion of every subje6t that may be made subservient to any valuable purpose.

Similitude, in one degree, is the relation of different species of 
the fame genus; and, in yet a nearer degree, it is the relation of individuals of the fame species. On these similitudes, the arrangement of descriptive history depends ; and, on this arrangement comprehension of thought and retention of memory, to a great extent, may be founded.

The relation of cause and effec, of which we are originally 
conscious in the efforts of mind, and the intended effed of those efforts, is afterwards supposed to exist also in the concomitancy of other fubjeds and events. When any number of effects can- be traced to the fame cause, they are said to be understood. They are retained in a ingle aa of comprehension or memory; and remembrance, in this cafe, is a continuing to understand what we have once well understood.

From the whole of these fats we may collea the great advantage of order in the arrangement of particulars, to facilitate the remembrance of them. When things to be remembered however numerous, are so placed, that the relation of contiguity concurs with those of similitude, cause, and effet, in leading the memory from one to another, the talk ofrecolletion may be performed with proportional ease.

3 In 
In performing this talk, we acually avail ourselves of the PART I



order in which things have been stated before us, and endeavour 
to pass from what we do remember to that which we propose v to recollect: But we may be asked, upon this subjed of recolleAion or intentional memory, in what sense can we intend to remember what we have actually forgotten.

Intention, in every inflance, implies a conception of what is intended; and the conception of a thing past, being the remembrance of it, would supersede the intention to recal it again.

There is a mystery in thought, which none of the corporeal 
images under which it has been expressed, can serve to illustrate.
It is not a type, an impreflion, or picture; for all these are particular, and contain at once all the parts that compose them;
and the pretence of any one part is the presence of the whole.
An intention to recollea is an effort of the mind to review the particulars of a subjed, of which some effet or concomitant circumstance is conceived, and employed, as a thread that may lead through the whole.

Men are observed to differ from one another very much in the 
measure of this faculty: It is conneaed with understanding;
for men continue long to remember what they have well understood: It is conneced with observation also; and men continue to remember, in the fame degree in which they have attentively observed the fubjeAs of thought.

Memory is, like other operations of mind, much affeed by 
the different conditions of the animal frame. In childhood, it is limited and of flort duration: The tranfadions of infancy,

accordingly,

PAR'r I. accordingly, are not remembered in the periods of manhood SC-r. VI. or youth. Of these, indeed, the transactions are remembered in 
ka', v old age; but what passes in extreme old age itself is seldom retained from one day, even from one hour, to another.

In accounting for these phenomena, we sometimes recur to 
mechanical fimilies, and the analogy of imprefions on materials soft, hard, or of some intermediate consistence. The mind, we conceive, is like wax, which may be softened too much to retain,
or too little to receive, an impression. In childhood, the material is too fofc, and gives way to impressions, but does not retain them. In old age, it is hard, and retains the impressions formerly made ; but does not receive any new ones. In manhood, the consistence is at once proper to receive, and to retain the imprefsions which are made upon it. In this we have a perfect model of the analogical theories, or explanations of the human underflanding, founded in simile that may pass among poetic allusions;
but, in science, only serves to confound the condition of different or opposite natures together.

We are conscious of memory, as we are of perception, in the 
proper sense of there words; and, though we know that perception is obtained by the intervention of animal organs, and even know,
that memory is connected with a state of the animal frame, yet we know not how either is constituted. Perception and memory are adive exertions of mind, and not a mere figure or motion impreflcd on body. This diftindtion of activity in mind, and of pasfivencfs in body, is retained in the grammatical forms of cxpreflion. The mind perceives or remembers; body is impelled,
Ilopped, or reccives an impression. And it cannot afford any fatisfaction 
tisfalion to be told, that a transition from one thought to ano- PART I.
ther in mind is a mere change of place or of figure; or, that a si- 


gure or motion, Somewhere retained, amounts to the memory of vI-'-,
what is past in perception or thought.

Of Imagination.

PART I. IN the use of what we have any way conceived and remember,
. e have occasion frequently, for the farther purpose of thought,
_v~z' to slate our fubjeds together or separately, and one subjeA fully 
or partially, according to the intention of the mind in that infiance. The first of these modes of conception may be termed Imagination, the other Abftration.

In imagination, we would state our subjed with all its qualities 
and circumstances, and a plurality of fubjeCs, in refpedc to all their relations of similitude, analogy, or opposition; whereas,
in abstraction, we would confider fubjeds, or parts of fubjeds, in some limited point of view, to which our reasoning or thought in that instance is directed.

Any given fubje& may thus exercise either faculties of imagination or abftracion. A mountain, for instance, may be to the poet or landscape painter, an objed of imagination; to the 
geometer 
geometer an object of abftration. Artists of the firit denomina- PART I.
tion state to themselves, or conceive at once its outline in the Iky; SHAP. 11.
the woods, rocks, and precipices that diversify its surface, and «v'
which rife above one another in forming its ascent. They may itate also the clouds that make a part in the back ground, the beasts that pasture upon it, and the eagles that soar above in the &ky.

The fame object may exercise also the powers, of geometry,

by which the artist may intend merely to measure its height;
he, accordingly, itates to himself no more than a vertical line,
that passes from its summit, at right angles, to its base. And this exercise of the mind is termed abstraction, because some one, or a few particulars, are taken into consideration apart from the whole.

Imagination is the faculty which we employ in narration, description, design, or invention. Abftradion, that which we employ in generalization or in conceiving, as Plato would express it, the one that runs through many individuals of the fame species or genus.

The language of imagination is metaphor, allegory, simile,

and antithesis, or contrait. Of this faculty it is the object in every instance to particularize; to present individuals in their separate form; to fill up a design with a detail of all the parts it is projeAed to have; or in speech to present the occasions of affection and passion, and the grounds of conviction, in such a manner, as to command the assent, and turn the whole force of the mind to a particular purpose.



HAP. IT So far it llould appear that imagination is the specific talent 
. of the orator and poet; and of importance, also, in qualifying men 
<vWx to treat of affairs; for in these nothing is abftraCd, or free from its 
particularities. Although in argument, single points may be feparately difcufled, and diftintnefs require the power of abftraction, yet, in proceeding to act, the whole of every subjea must be conceived together; for so it exists in nature, and so it must be expeded to meet the person who would operate upon it, or conduct himself properly with refped to it. In speculations on mechanism, moving pressure, and friction may be confidered apart; but, in pracdice, they occur and must be confidered together. In speculations on the military art, the nature of a country, of troops whether of horse or foot, of arms, cannon or mufquetry, and above all, the nature of men to be commanded or led into action, may, for the fake of diftindCnefs, be confidered apart, and each by itself furnifi matter of regular discourse; but,
in practice, the whole muff be taken together; and the neglect of any part will frustrate the most specious advantage of knowledge respecting the others.

Different men, either from nature or habit, are variously qualified either for imagination or abftradion, and mutually look upon the talents in which they themselves are defetive with some degree of contempt'; although it is evident that real ability consifts in a proper assemblage of both. The engineer can never know the amount of the different powers he is to employ, or of the refiflance he is to overcome, without confidering each of them apart, so as to estimate its quantity; nor can he turn his science to use, without being able to conceive how the whole is to be treated, when present at once, and operating together.

In 
In imagination, subje&s may be confidered as single and fepa- PART. I.


rate, or as forming plurality and number of constituent parts. .

In confidering a plurality of fubjeAs together, we have not 
only to conceive the separate qualities, circumstances, and peculiarities of each, we attend to their relations also, whether of imilitude, analogy, or opposition.

Similitude, or the repetition of like parts and qualities, is the 
foundation of clafification, or leads to the arrangement of subjects in descriptive history.

Analogy is the repetition of like proportions, or corresponding 
relations. Things unlike may be analogous: Thus, the fin of a fish and the wing of a bird, the water of the sea and the air of of the atmosphere, are unlike; but there may be analogy between them; for, as the fin is to the water, so is the wing to the air,
and so forth.

In consequence of analogy, though in matters unlike, the names 
of operation and quality are transferred from one to another ; as a bird may be said to swim through the air, and a fish to fly in the water: and, in such instance, according as the subjea fiomr which an expression is borrowed is more familiar, more elevated,
or mean, than that to which it is applied, the metaphor has a corresponding effect, in illustrating, in raising, or in finking the matter in which it is used. Thus, a person whom we would fink in the public esteem is said to be obscure; and a person who is supposed to be eminent for any talent or virtue is said to shine. A
person who speaks with great force of expreflion, is laid to thun0 2 der;

'PART I. der; or the breeze that gently stirs the leaves, in pafling through CTAP. vi a wood, is laid to sigh, or to whisper.


In the lavish and profuse application of metaphor, the separate 
divisions of nature are, in some measure, blended together. The intellecual, animal, vegetable, and mechanical kingdoms, receive the appellation of qualities one from the other. The magnetic needle isfaithJul and true to the pole. The lover is attraSted by the charms of his mistress. A thought is heavy, and memory is esfaced. There is a collision of sentiments, and the qualities of bodies are adverse one to another. This is termed metaphorical language; may serve to vary a file; to supply the defect of proper terms; to display imagination, or help out the effec of rhetorical composition, in catling the colours of one fubjeft upon another. It is reckoned an ornament of stile: but, in the correct statement of truth, the use of proper expression, it mufl be confessed, has a beauty and elegance, which metaphorical language never can reach ".

Allegory like metaphor is founded in the supposed analogy of 
fubjets : But as metaphor is accompliflied in single terms, allegory may be continued in relation or description to any extent;
while entire fubjeas with all the language that in propriety belongs to them are substituted one for the other.

But although, in the allegory, persons or things of one kind only are presented, it is intended that persons or things of a different kind should be conceived or understood. Thus, in the well known table or picture of Cebes, inclofures, fields, lawns, and 
rocky Scc (te writings ofSir D.vidl .llrymplc p.ain'i.

rocky ascents, interspersed with figures and buildings of different PART I.
descriptions, are meant to exhibit the circumstances of human CHAP. IT



life, the characters and passions of men, with the event of their v-v different occupations and pursuits.

Allegory may thus be confidered as metaphor extended from 
single qualities to many such; and it may be continued through all the corresponding circumstances and operations of nature, so far as the analogy is obvious. Cr if it ihould be far fetched and obscure, the allegory may still be understood with the help of a comment, or what is termed a key to disclose it.

Allegories are sometimes amusing, and may serve to express,

in a disguised or artful way, what, more directly flated, might be offensive or less agreeable: But allegories are otherwise seldom inftrudive. A very common thought may appear ingenious in its allegorical dress, from the ingenuity and aptness of prefentation of one thing for another; or it may appear profound, from the difficulty of perceiving what is meant under a far fetched fubfiitution: But talents are surely misapplied; in rendering that difficult in allegory which, directly expressed, would be familiar and easy.

In there observations, our object is not to analyse figures of 
rhetoric, but merely to illustrate, by reference to some effecs of imagination, a faculty which is of so much importance in the history of mind.

Even fmnile, too, notwithifanding the meaning of the term,

proceeds upon the analogy, rather than the identity or fimilitude of fubjccts. If the objecC of simile were to point out subjets 
PA RT. jedts that were like. What more like the action and charaCter of ' A IIl. one man than the action and character of another: Yet such Sec r. VII.

., comparisons are never ufedcin poetry. Diomed is never said to 
have fought like Achilles, nor Ajax like Idomeneus. The host of Greeks is not compared to any other multitude of men; but to a swarm of bees. The warrior, who bravely maintains his post is compared to a rock in the sea, beat by the surge, but immoveable. The host of angels, moving their spears at the signal of command, is compared to a field of corn waving in the wind.
Even Ajax, in his unwilling and flow retreat from a multitude of enemies, is compared, not to any other man in'like circumstances,
but to an ass, who quits the field of corn with reluCtance, and does not mend his pace, though assailed by all the flicks and stones of the village.

Contrast is also an effort of imagination, in which the opposition 
of fibjects is brought into view. Things opposite are so ifated, as that the qualities in which they stand opposed, become the more perceptible or striking. Thus colours are contrasted in painting,
virtues and vices, knowledge and ignorance, parts and incapacity, in the characters and dispositions of men.

Contraff is the reverse of simile, and antithesis the reverse of 
metaphor. When they arise naturally from the subjet, they constitute an ornament of style, and may be of great force in promoting its effects, but crowded improperly betray affedation and give disgust.

Of A4bfrat7ion.
WE have, in the last fecion, taken the benefit of contrait, in PART. I.



placing the definitions of imagination and abftraAion together. SEcT. vIlI.
In the one, a fubje& is flated in all its qualities and circumftan- 'vY
ces; in the other, one or a few points are taken for separate confideration.

Some degree of abftraaion is expressed in every general term,

and indeed in every word of a language, except in the proper names which are affixed to mere individuals. In the term animal, we abftraa what is common to all living creatures, from what is peculiar to any species or genus. The shepherd, in talking of his flock, can tell of what is common to the kind, without entering into the peculiarities of any individual. The poltman can exac his hire for the length of the road, without any regard to its breadth. The geometer does no more, when he reasons of lines, or of length, without breadth; and of surfaces, or of length and breadth, without thickness; even of points or mere place,


PART I. without any dimension whatever: He knows, in the mean time,
HCAPI. II that every body, and every space, atually has all the dimensions I.

-v ' of length, breadth, and thickness, and cannot be imagined without them.

In flating the laws of nature, we abstract what is common and 
uniform in many operations, from what is singular, and serves to diversify particular instances. In metaphysics or ontology, we abfirad what is common or universal to all beings, from the multiplicity of diftindive and separate qualities. The language of science, in this manner, becomes abstruse and intricate to the vulgar. And abftration, or metaphysical reasoning, in which itis carried to the greatest height, is another name for what is incomprehenfible or difficult : But it is, in reality, no more than a continuation of what is performed by the feeblest understanding, in treating things of a kind, under their generic or common appellations.

How far ordinary minds proceed in this matter, without asfeeting the heights of science, may be learned from the ftrudure of the most vulgar dialed, in which every term, that is not a mere proper name, is expressive of some abflracion.

If a language, even that of a savage nation, contain the generic terms of animal and vegetable, or universal terms of substance, quality, quantity, and so on; so far, may we be assured that the people who speak that language, even the moit rude, have abfirated; and, so far, the dired operation is familiar to every one:
Although the reflex at of the mind, in recolleding and stating what the mind itself has done, is reserved for men of speculation and fcicnce.

3 - We 
We may observe in nature a variety of fubjeas, which, being PART I.

applicable to some purposes in human life, are said to be useful; .
and hence, without taking into our account the refpeaive purpose v \
which any one subjea in particular may serve, we admit its utility; and refer to this, general predicament timber, flone, metals plants animals, and whatever else, though indefinitely varied, agree in the circumstance of being useful to man.

We observe also a variety of fubjets which are, in themselves, or 
in their place, excellent and beautiful. The eye, the hand, and the foot, are beautiful in their ftrudure, and contribute to beauty in the frame of which they are a part. In the use of the abftra& term, beauty, we overlook the peculiarities of any particular fubjedt, to state what is common to this with other beautiful fubjeas or forms. Beauty may be resolved into excellence;
and is one of the afpeds of what is good. In what nature of things it is constituted, we flall have occasion to confider in pursuing, to its different applications, the important diflindion of good and evil. In the mean time, it is mentioned merely in illuflration of that operation of mind, which we term abstraction.

As, in the use of this faculty, entity is the subjeót of metaphysics 
or ontology, as quantity is the subjed of geometry; so the abflrat form of an operation in nature is a physical law, and its application the conflituent ofphyfical science. Tlie abflracd form and expreflion of what is excellent or good, is a moral law, and ;
principle of moral fciencc.

PART I.
 IN nature all the fubjeas presented to our observation are idi vidual, and marked with their particular qualities and circum' fances. In the exercise of imagination or fancy, we proceed after 
the model of nature, and particularlize whatever we conceive for any purpose of contemplation, design, or invention. But, if we would colled many particulars under one or a few general titles,
we must abftradt the conditions in which they agree from those in which they differ.

As imagination, therefore, may be termed the faculty of particularization, abftraaion may be termed the faculty of generalization.

This faculty, applied to matters of description, gives the fpecies and genera of things; applied to the fuccefIion of events,
gives the laws of nature; and applied to matters of choice, gives the laws of morality.

1~~I~~~~The 
ThC

The physical laws of nature may be collected from a sufficient PART I.
number of particulars which, though differing in circumstances, 



and diversfifed in their appearances, suggest a general fad common <Ev to many operations. Thus, the law of gravitation, or the prefsure of bodies in the vertical line, is traced through all the phenomena of weight in bodies at reft, of acceleration in falling bodies, of retardation in ascending bodies, of vibration in pendulums, and of the curvature described in projectiles, and so forth.

The law being thus ascertained, it is applied to the explanation of many phenomena which, of themselves, would never have suggested the law. Such are the varying pressures of fluids on the bottoms and fides of veflels proportioned not to their quantity or absolute weight, but to their depth or altitude. Such are the ebbing and flowing of the sea, the procession of the equinoxes, the revolution of planets in their orbits, and so forth; of which the explanations, so obtained, are termed theories of the respective phenomena to which they belong.

In this manner, physical science is conitituted, and particulars are said to be understood and scientifically known when we can refer them to the physical laws under which they are comprehended.

The object of physical science being fad and reality, it is evident 
that mere hypothesis cannot be substituted for a law of nature, nor any theory sustained, in which the principle is not tome known or existing law of nature, and its application sufficient to explain the appearance. It is also evident that, where any appearance is comp-ehended in any well known law of nature, it is unneceflary to seek for any other account or explanation of it. Such is the 
P 2 tendency 
tendency of the rules which Newton laid down to himself in proPART I. ceedirig to explain the phenomena of the planetary system.


t.r.y\. Science is sometimes defined the knowledge of causes and their 
effects in nature. But cause and effect, so far as we are enabled to conceive their relation, are terms of the fame meaning with those we have employed, namely, law of nature, and its phenomena.

The relation of cause and effet is familiarly conceived; but 
metap'hysicians are not agreed on the origin of this conception.
Some are of opinion, that it originates in the mere conjunction.or concomitancy of one thing with another; as in the conjunction of expansion with heat, or of motion with impulse, and so forth.

Mere conjunction, however, will not account for the notion of 
cause and effect; for things are- conjoined without suggesting any such relation between them; as the waves that break on the-fhore;
the leaves, blossoms, and fruit, that come in succession through the spring and summer. Nor could mere conjunction, without a previous notion of this. relation ever -fuggefi any thing besides contiguity of time or place.

The relation of cause and effec is probably conceived firfi in 
the mind itself; in the relation of its own efforts to their intended effet ; in. the relation of evidence: to the conviction produced by it: And the relation being thus previously conceived,
may be afterwards presumed to exist on the credit of signs or proofs, which appear fuificient to evince its. reality in any particular instance; as in the cafe of things uniformly observed together, and in the fa1me proportions.

Where 
Where this is the cafe, we aflaume the relation of cause and es- PART I.



seA; and, as there is a necessary connection betwixt evidence and 
belief, we assume alibo,not the: mere concomitancy, but the necefity rV
of an effect from its cause,. and conversely the necessity of a cause to the production of an effect. It is confeiied nevertheless by metaphysicians, that, notwithstanding this assumed necessity of a cause to the production of every effeA, the intimate nature of causality or operating power, is nowhere so known to us as to let us perceive its efficacy. And when we fay, that gravitation is the cause of weight in bodies, we mean no more than that the weight of a body, whether at reft or in motion, is a particular phenomenon of the general law, by which bodies press to the earth in the vertical line.

When we do not perceive a cause, we. are apt to imagine one,

and thus. substitute imagination to supply the defect of our knowledge. It is safer, therefore, to acknowledge our ignorance in this matter, and to aim at the investigation of laws, in which we may acaually succeed, and in which we cannot mitfake hypotheis for fact and reality, than to. use a term which is ambiguous in its meaning, and under which we may substitute supposition and fancy, for observation in assigning the causes of things.

Sir Isaac Newton, in his theory of the planetary fyflem, flewed that the phenomena are comprehended in the well-known laws of motion and gravitation, familiar in the terrestrial spaces, and equally applicable to the heavens.

Des Cartes, in search of a cause for the planetary revolutions,
fippofed the space in which they move to be replcniflled with mattelr,

PART I. ter, and that matter to be in motion, in the manner of a whirlCHPr.I. pool or vortex. Here is supposition upon supposition, without 
orsy^ any evidence of reality; an error which is more likely to be committed while in search of causes, which may be supposed occult,
than while we investigate a law of nature, of which the very name implies a series of fads well known to exist.

Although, therefore, we sometimes define science to be the 
knowledge of causes, and of their effects; yet it is safer and more accurate, or more congenial to the actual state of our conception,
to fay that it is the knowledge of the laws of nature, comprehending a multiplicity of diversified appearances, which the law may serve to explain.

The works of intelligent power are comprised under general 
laws, or generic decfriptions; and observation is gratified, in tracing particulars to the general titles, whether of description or of physical law, in which they are comprehended. As creative intelligence proceeds in this form, the created mind cannot otherwife arrive at any maturity, or enlargement of knowledge.

So far, than, we have pursued the history of understanding, or 
the power cognitive, through its several fnimcions ofconcioufnefs,
perception, observation, memory, imagination, abftradion, and science.

Under the last of these titles, no doubt, we may include not 
only the application of generic principles to the explanation of phenomena, or particular appearances; but the application of moral principles also o. direCt the choice of voluntary agents.

The 
The last may be termed moral science, and is a principal arti- PART II

cle in the history of Mind: But before we proceed to the confidera- 
tion of it, we must attend to the specific principles of action aznd choice by which human nature is characerized.

or any experience of the means to be employed in obtaining them.

Of such inftindive directions, in human nature, there are feveral examples: Such as the inftincive effort common to man,
with the other animals, upon the contaA of air, to ply the mufcles employed in respiration; and, upon application of the lip to the nipple, to ply the muscles employed in fuc2ion. In these in(lances, complicated operations are performed, of which, the nature is so far from being understood by the infant who performs them, that it had baffled from time immemorial the searches of speculative man, and is but recently known in the progress of science.

To 
To these we may add, the well-known inftindive abhorence of a TART I.

precipice, by which man, as well as many of the other animals, is SeeT. X.
a£feced in looking down from a height. In this instance, the vo-'
head grows giddy, and gives warning of danger, which certainly precedes the knowledge of what might be feared from a .
fall. To know this, we must suppose the party apprised of the accelerating power of gravitation, which, continuing to operate in falls of a certain height, increase the velocity and force of the blow,
with which the falling body strikes on the ground, so as neceffarily to destroy life. Such knowledge animals, that tremble on their approach to a precipice, certainly have not; nor would it be safe for a man to have no other guide, in this matter, but his own experience and knowledge of the laws of gravitation and collision. The first trial he made might be fatal: And nature has kindly anticipated the effets of knowledge, in a certain feeling of dizziness and fear of falling, which keeps the person concerned from exposing himself to such dangers. These warnings,
indeed, may become unnecessary in proportion as those who are accustomed to climb and look down from heights, learn to secure themselves by proper expedients and pretence of mind; and the feeling is accordingly worn off, or abates by practice and time.

There are other examples of inftlinive direAion, which,

though not operating from the birth, or through the earlier periods of childhood, yet germinate in the progress of the animal frame, and, in the use of means, give a singular impetuosity, to to which a knowledge of their end seldom contributes.

But the more general charaQer of man's inclinations, or ac-.

Man is thus disposed to preserve himself; and the manner also 
is, in some degree, specified or pointed out to him by the appetite of hunger, which forms a general diredion to the use of food. Attention to his safety likewise is enforced by the painful sensations that warn him of his danger from fire, from extreme cold, from suffocation, impure air, wounds or hurts of any fort' But the precise material with which hunger is to be gratified, and the precise expedients with which he may be fecured from harm, are left, in a great measure, to his awn choicein the result of his observation and experience.

variety of ways which, in different situations, may be taken to supply his occasions, whether in respect to subsistence,.
shelter, accommodation, or ornament; all of them recommendec by nature under the general head of his preservation and convenience, safety or well-being: But he is so. far from being limited by his inftinds to any particular species or form of materials for every purpose, as the beaver is limited in the particular construction of his dam, or the bee in the form of his cell, and every bird in the materials and struCture of his airy or nest; that he is disposed to innovate on every pradice, whether of nature or art;. and finds occasion to diversify his manner wherever he is placed, or to whatever situation he is enabled to advance himself.

To the other animals appetite continues to be the sole motive 
to action, and the animal, in every moment of time, proceeds upon the motive then present. But to man, the repeated experience of gratifications and crofnes, like the detail of particulars in any other instance, is matter of generalization: He collects from thence the predicaments of good and evil, and is affected towards any particular object, according as he has referred it to the one or to the other. In the intervals of any particular appetite or inftinac, he can take measures to secure his good, or to avert his eviL

It has been observed that man has, in common with the other 
gregarious animals, a disposition to associate with his kind; but this, beyond the limits of a mere family connetion, is not direced to any determinate form of society. His company may be large or contraced, and his policy republic or monarchy. But,
to whatever form it inclines or approaches, he ever meets with specific inconveniencies, which he is desirous to remove; or is presented with some profpet of advantage, which he is desirous to gain: And society itself is to him, like every other article in his condition, an occasion of exercise or exertion to his intellectual as well as animal nature. Public juitice and order are,
therefore, to man a species of real good, and objets of desire;
public disorder and wrong a species of evil, and corresponding objecs of aversion.

Animals, in general, have inftindive propenlitics to the use of their organs; and man, we may add, to the use of his faculties:

Q.2 IIe 
PART I. He repudiates whatever tends to restrain him, and is glad of occafions that call forth the exercise of his powers. Confinement SECT. X.

,-~v and freedom are therefore to him among the principal conflituents of good or of evil.

In his relation to other men he has indefinite scope for the exercife of his active dispositions. The family to which he is attached, the friend he loves, the public cause he has espoused, furnifh him with so many interests to be guarded or pursued together with his own. As he is not indifferent to the objects around him as they concern himself, no more is he indifferent to their presence or absence in the lot of other men with whom he has a general sympathy of commiseration or joy.

Whatever the individual may incline to obtain or avoid for 
himself, he may also have at heart for his friend or his country;
and hence we derive the distinction of selfish and sociable in the characers of men.

In nature at large we are su'rrounded with specimens of beauty and deformity, of excellence and defect. We have not names for the particular faculties by which there objects are diftinguifled; or rather the distinCtion is conceived to exist in the nature of things, and intelligence itself is supposed a competent power of discernment. The general silence of language refpelting any other faculty is a presumption that no separate appellation of that kind is required.

In judging of what is excellent or beautiful, we discriminate 
the frame and combination of material fubjeds, as well as the condition of living and intelligent natures. To the latter, however,

ever, chiefly the diftindion of excellence and defed refers. The PART I.
good and the ill, that is apprehended in the character of mind, 

SECT. X.

we esteem or reprobate in ourselves and others, with supreme as- re fedion or dislike.

In the diftindtion of excellence and defec&, we find the occasions 
of various passions; as ofpride, vanity, emulation, magnanimity, or elevation of mind, that keep pace with the applications of excellence whether erroneous or just. The general disposition to excel,
next to interest, is the most ordinary, and even more than interest,
a powerful motive to ation, and an occasion of the greatest exertions incident to human nature. To this we may refer the honest man's integrity, which he will not forego to preserve his life; the gentleman's honour, to which he is ready to sacrifice every consideration of ease or safety; the soldier's glory; and the martyr's crown.

The mere inItina of a gregarious animal is, in human nature,

but the fmnalleft part of the social character. Besides the mutual disposition of the sexes; of parent and child; the predilection of friends; and the affection of citizens to their country; already mentioned as the principles upon which Societies of a particular denomination are formed, or maintained; there is a principle of sympathy and indiscriminate concern in the condition of a fellow creature, whether prosperous or adverse; to which, as congenial to man, even where it operates in pity towards any other animal, we give the name of humanity: There is an esteem of merit, and a love of justice; there is a reprobation ofwickednefs,
and an indignation at wrongs; all of them turning upon the diltindion of benevolence and malice, or upon the fitness or unfitness of the individual to fill his place in focicty, as a part well adapted to fich a wholc.

CHAP. II
SLCT. X. man himself is still the most important objec of the scene; he is 
the principal objed of love, confidence, and esteem; or the principal object of diftrufi, detestation, and contempt; according as he uses well, or abuses, those powers of nature and art, with which he is furnished. This forms, relatively to him, the diftincion of beauty and deformity, of excellence and defect, of merit and demerit, of virtue and vice; and is to his mind the genuine source of glory and shame, the supreme objects of choice or rejection, and the hinge upon which his ambition ihould turn in all his endeavours to better himself, or to avoid the degradation or disgrace to which he is exposed.

In nature every specimen of good or of evil is particular, individual, or separate. From certain coincidencies, we combine numbers together, under the predicaments of useful or detrimental, of profit or loss, beauty or deformity, excellence or defed, virtue or vice.

Whether it be proper to range fubjeas of such different denominations under any common predicament, of good on the one hand, or of evil on the other, was warmly disputed in the antient schools of philosophy, and is a question of mere arrangement, or at most of moral discernment, not of historical sac, in the statement of which we are now engaged.

The diftinaion of good and evil originates in the sensibility of 
intelligent beings to the circumstances in which they are placed,
or to the qualities of their own nature. But the application of this diftintion, and the course of life to proceed from it, will den.a2~~~~~ ~~~pend 
pend on the associations men have formed, and even on the epi- PARr I.
thets of good and evil, they are used to bestow on the fubjeds 

SFcr. X.

that occur to their choice. They covet what is reputed profita- ov ble, beautiful, or honourable, and shun what is reputed pernicious, vile, or disgraceful..

Man, save when he is urged by mere inflind, without any 
knowledge of an end, ads upon his conception of things, and is led in different direcions, according as he conceives an objec in his imagination, or in his view, to be ranged under either of the opposite predicaments we have mentioned. Where wealth is conceived as honourable, poverty as lhameful, the very desire of excellence, or ambition itself, will take the direction of avarice.
Where merit is limited to arbitrary forms of behaviour, virtue itself will become a principle of formality or superstitious obfervancc.

Such conceptions may be termed the practical notions of 
things, and are of supreme importance among the conitituents of a human character, or among the principles upon which the part to be acted through life will depend.

To whatever objeec we incline, or however we may have claffed individual things in our conception of what is good or evil,
it is proper to remember in this place, that every effort of the mind is also individual and particular, relating to an object in some particular and individual situation. The object is either agreeable and desircd, or disagreeable and avoided. It is secure in poffeilion, or precarious and imminent; hence our active dispositions are either the joy of the successful, the grief of the disappointed,
the hope of those who have good in profped, the fear of those to 
whom 
PART. I. whom evil is imminent, or who are threatened with the privation  of good. Thus, every Sentiment of the feeling mind is particuSECT. X.

w<} lar; and the term, affecion, which is neither the joy of the fuccefsful, the grief of the disappointed, the hope of those to whom success appears probable, nor the fear of those who diftrufl an event, is a mere abftra6tion, no where exiiting in nature; but convenient, like other abftrations, in the statement of a fubjedt, as matter of discussion or argument.

Whilst, therefore, we term a disposition, abffratly confidered,

an affeAion of mind, we may term the modifications of this asfeeion, exhibited in different circumitances of the objed, the panIons; and these being necessary, in one degree or other, must,
upon the supposition of a just affedtion, and a just degree of sentiment, be acknowledged to be just also.

The feeling, which we have when our object is in danger, may 
be necessary to excite the proper exertions, and therefore not only natural but efTential to the propriety of character.

The fame feeling, when our objeCt is secure, would be prepofterous, and mislead our condut. When a mother fees her child approach to the fire; her affecAion, which the .moment before was secure, takes the form of alarm; and the change may be no more than sufficient to haften her efforts in behalf of her charge.

So long as the passions retain this measure of propriety, and 
are effectual to animate the mind to its proper exertions, it is unneccflfary to obicrve that they are no more than the purpose of nature fiems to require ; for, even if a person could, without any nmotion, ward off the dangers of his country or his friend, we 
think 
think it becoming, that the energy of his affection {hould be PART. I.
in due proportion with the occasion on which it is felt. It is no CHAP. II

SECT. X.

more than the force of a spring wound up to give an engine the vr movement required; and when that force keeps pace with the refiftance to be overcome, its variations conititute a beauty, in the ftruture of which it is a part.

If, nevertheless, an affection should frustrate itself in becoming 
a degree of emotion disproportioned to the occasion, fiill more if the mind should incur a perturbation disqualifying it for the part that ought to be acted; it is evident that passion, in this sense or degree, must be reprobated as improper and deftrutive of the very end for which our affections and their different modifications are given.

In dramatic poetry, the occasional changes of passion are difplayed; and the entertainment would languish if any uniform tenor of affection were preserved through all the varieties of a prosperous or an adverse fortune. Such a tenor, however, or purpose of mind, which, without appearance of agitation or difturbance, is prompt and effecual in the discharge of its office,
though unfit for theatric representations, is unquestionably the most dignified and forcible in the conduct of life. For this reason, Epictetus enjoins his pupils not to be acting tragedies with acclamations of joy at one time, with accents of grief, and alas, at another time. And, for this reason, the characters of Cato, or of Socrates, were less fit for the fRage than that of (Edipus or Andromache.

Pafion, in common language, implies some excess of emotion or perturbation; and it is in this degree or extrcmc, we arc 
VOL. I. R commonly 
PART I. commonly admonfihed to beware of its effects. The passions were proscribed in the schools of antient philosophy, not mereS /-VC - ly upon this ground, of their excess, but upon the ground of 
their incompatibility also with the model of perfection, implied under the denomination of wisdom. This character consisted in the choice of virtue, confidered as the sole good; and in the rejedion of vice, as the sole evil. A good consisting in choice alone, and therefore ever present to the wife who has made that choice, is an object of uniform fatisfadion, not of fluctuating emotion to joy from grief, or from hope to fear. The question was not, how far this state of the affections was realized in any instance, but how far it was a fit model of perfection, to which the efforts of men should be directed.

Before we conclude this account of our primary sources of in.

clination, the modifications of passion, of which they are fufceptible, and the pracical notions or conceptions from which they proceed; it is proper to observe, that notwithstanding any bias originally given to the nature of man, or any difltintive bias which the individual may have taken to himself in his manner of thinking or acting, he is, nevertheless, voluntary in every choice,
and is the master of his own actions.

It is well known to the conscious mind, that, however strongly an inftind, an affection, or opinion, may.iriftigate will in the line of their respective directions, and however frequently they may prevail, that yet there is a sovereign power of choice by which any inclination may be suspended, over-ruled, or prevented of its effects. Thus the sick patient, though but of moderate resolution, can deny himself the gratifications of appetite,
or obey the molt nauseous prescription, when reason requires the 

1

sacrifice. And the humane can resist the partial dictates of pity, PART I.
when juitice requires a more firm and decided exertion of judge- SEcTA. X.
ment for the good of mankind. v 
When we would make a mere animal depart from the path of 
his inftinC, or refrain from the gratification of his appetite, there must be a master to apply the force which is necelfary for this purpose: But man is his own master; and, in the exercise of this sovereign power of the will, can repeat his efforts, however different from those to which his inftinds would lead him, until he acquires that inclination, facility, and power of performance,
which we term his habit, and which though acquired is scarcely to be diftinguiflled from an original propensity.

Such acquisitions, no doubt, merit a place in the history of 
the human mind; but as they are adventitious, or distinguishable from the original sources of inclination, they will come more properly to be confidered hereafter, among the principles of progreffion in human nature; by which man, in the exercise of his power over himself, may gain adventitious perfecions, or incur adventitious defeAs, according to the truth of his judgements,
and the tenor of his choice.

In possession of the sovereign power over himself, the guilty 
may plead his passions in extenuation of his guilt; but passion itself is an objec of moral censure, and the passionate is conscious of responsibility for the part he may have adled under its influence.

Having thus, under the title of the primary sources of inclination, mentioned the pracical notions of things, and the foveR 2 reign

minate inftin&, we have observed, that he adcs upon the concep- 
tion he has formed of the objecs around him.

Some of his conceptions are taken from experience and obfervation; others from report or the prevailing opinions of other men.

Even of those conceptions that are taken from experience and 
observation, rome are founded upon the ordinary course of things, others upon single events or casual coincidencies.

On the conceptions which are founded upon the ordinary 
course of things, we may safely proceed, trusting that nature,
being regular and permanent, will persevere in the order flie has eftablified. The husbandman accordingly, having experienced 
the 
PART I. the succession of seasons, with their effecs, securely sows that he may reap. And men commonly, having observed the condition 
'voj-ws and temper of their neighbour, frequent or shun him, according 
as they conceive him to be an object of confidence or distrust;
and every individual from his infancy, having made adual trial of what is pleasant or painful, profitable or unprofitable, excellent or vile, may truit his conceptions, well founded in experience, as a rule of conduct through life.

In deriving an apprehension from any real event, we have the 
authority of fad; but single fads, in a merely fortuitous coincidence of circumflances, are not to be received as models of what nature would have us to conceive. A place, and the calamity which may have happened in it, a person, and the ill news he may have brought, have in fad been presented together; but by accident merely, and without any connection to justify our conceiving them as one. Such conceptions, neverthelefi, are known to seize upon the weak and unwary mind; and, by an association of things, in their own nature unconnected, make that, which is in itself indifferent, an object of fond desire, or of vehement aversion and horror; of this there are Iriking examples in what is termed antipathy to particular objects or things.

Individuals, for the most part, without any authority of fads,

tingle or multiplied, take their notion of things from report or prevailing opinion. A person, fays the Spetator, " may be talk" ed into any opinion or belief;" and it is undoubtedly true,
that the bulk of mankind take up their opinions upon trust, from what they find commonly received or inculcated in the world.
With them, to be often repeated, and again and again conceived,
upon the authority of others, has the fame effeAt as to be experienced,

rienced, or repeatedlyperceived in the ordinary course of things. PART I.
The conception becomes equally habitual in either cafe, and pro- SCHA. T I.
duces the fame effet. S\Ty 
From this source the bulk of the people derive their conceptions on the point of honour, and on the constituents of rank or diftin'tion, whether birth, fortune, or personal qualities. From this source they derive their veneration for the religion, and their refpec for the government of their country.

On these fubjeds, we think by contagion with other men;

and remain fubmiflive to government, or docile to religion, so long as the world continues to set the example. As we follow the herd, in forming our conceptions of what was refpedtable, so we are ready to follow the multitude also when such conceptions come to be questioned or rejected; and are no less vehement reformers of religion, and revolutionists in government, when the current of opinion has turned against former establishments,
than we were zealous abettors while that current continued to fetin a different direction.

To this tendency of minds, to a general conformity of thought,

there are no doubt exceptions; not only in the cafe of those who are inclined and qualified to think for themselves, and to derive their conceptions from a better source than that of vulgar opinion; but also in the cafe of others less fortunate in their chara&er, by whom figularity is mistaken for eminence, and is entertained as an objed of ambition: Such men asseA to dissent from the multitude, and work themselves into singular notions of things, taken up at first from affetation, and continued through time into habit.

The 
PART. I. The recluse forms his notions of things upon the model of his 
own very limited observation, or on the suggestion of reprefen'Y ~tations with which he has occasion to amuse his solitude. Men 
of speculation also are apt to mistake their own abftradion for realities; and lliould find their talents misplaced in the midst of affairs that have reference to circumstances indefinitely varied and minute. Their merit lies in discourse rather than ation;
and they may appear with advantage, where general knowledge is to be displayed in language, without the trial of practice and application to the producion of real effects. Men of ability in conduct are often deficient in discourse; and the eloquent, on the contrary, often descend from their eminence, when brought to the tefl of ability in any of the more difficult scenes of action.

Men of every description, according to Lord Bacon, have their 
idols, or peculiar misapprehensions, by which they are milled from the truth. If the recluse are visionary, the vulgar are taken up with any triffles that happen to be in common repute. In the ordinary competitions for rank, precedence, or consideration,
they are so much occupied with there supposed comparative advantages, that the real and absolute blessings of a happy nature are overlooked ; and, in the course they pursue, men appear to profit no less by the depreflion of others than they do by their own advancement. Hence the evil passions of envy, jealousy, and malice,. the principal source or constituents of depravation and evil in human life.

Passion, once entertained, serves to confirm the notion on which 
it is founded: But, from whatever source our conceptions are derived, it is agreeable to the general law of our nature already ftaI tcdt,

ted, that fubjets and qualities once conceived together, ihould PART I.
also recur together, as often as either is presented to the mind. 
A thing once conceived as useful or pernicious recurs under the fame predicament; and this disposition to conceive things, as they have been afiociated, is confirmed by habit; or, where an aTfociation of mere fancy has been repeatedly entertained, may proceed upon habit alone.

In this manner, we not only come to attach qualities to fibje6ts, with which they have not any real connection in the ordinary course of things; but we also attach feeling and emotion of mind to things which are not, in reality, objects of any such emotion or feeling: Insomuch that as often as the object is presented, we incur the emotion; or if the emotion is, by any alarm or contagion, excited, we presently recur to the accustomed objet. The fearful, when panic-ftruck, imagine they fee spectres in the dark, or hear the report and clash of weapons in the air.

Of all the examples which serve to evince or illustrate this 
law of association, language is the most familiar and obvious.

The signs which compose a language, it is well known, are arbitrary, and have been varied indefinitely by the choice or caprice of those who employ them: Yet such is the connection,
which use has formed between a sign and its meaning, that the vulgar are apt to believe the words of their own language to be natural expreflions, and those of any other language to be nmre jargon, or a capricious deviation from nature. " Tain, Bread," said a Frenchman, under the cfFcds of this belief, " Pourquoi Bread:

VTOL. I. S "L Le 
PART I. " Les Francois font les chores tout simple, ils appellent Pain,
 " Pain."


Even to those who know the arbitrary institution of signs, the t found of a word presents its meaning; and to those who are verfed in different languages, any one of many founds may present the fame meaning: So that things, however different in nature and in their physical effects, as a name is different from the thing named, yet in the mind come to be so confounded together, that the presentment of the one is equivalent to the prefentment of both; and the effects they produce, promiscuously ascribed to the one or the other. Words are said to provoke; because they are generally employed for this purpose;
and the fame meaning may be conveyed without any such esfeca, when the offensive terms are omitted. A person's assertions may be questioned, or his civilities declined without any offence;
but to fay that he is impertinent, or lies, would have a different effect.

The aflociation of names with things may be so formed, as 
to give a habit of passing indifferently from the thing to the name, or from the name to the thing, as is the cafe of every person in the use of his mother tongue: Or, it may be a ha-.
bit of pafling only from the name to its meaning, but not the converse of easily passing from the meaning to the name, as is the cafe with those who have learned a foreign language imperfecly, and who understand what they read or hear in it, but arc unable to speak it.

This degree of attainment, in the uic of a foreign language,
like the habit of pafling from A to 13, but not of recurring 
from 
from B to A, is a habit of conceiving the sense, if the word come PART I.
first; but not of being ready with the word, when we would CHAP'. I

S CT. XL
express the sense. try 
Such fa&s then, may be colleced into a general law of our :
nature:

That the concommitancy of things or circurnmances, leads to a habit of conceiving them together.

So that any accidental combination of fubjeas may become 
the object of united conception in us. The presentment of a part is equivalent to the presentment of the whole; and we are agitated on the appearance of anyone of two or more associated subjeas, as if the others were adually present: Insomuch that persons,
not on their guard against such associations, may be in the power of any accidental or common coincidence for the tenor of their ordinary affections or palfions; and exhibit examples of a temper or spirit in common life, for which nature has laid no other foundation in their constitution, besides this, of their being cxpofed to adopt such conceptions of things as lead to such modifications of the temper.

The ingenuous differ from the malicious; the first in conceiving mankind as copartners and friends, the other in conceiving them as rivals and enemies: And this difference of apprehension hath its intimate source in the aflociation of happiness, which one may have made with qualities of an absolute value; another with circulnftances, in refped to which, the advantages of men are merely comparative. Insomuch that elevation of mind, though the 
S . noblest 
PART I. noblest and most powerful affection of humannature, is not al ways fire of its aim. While the ingenuous attach it to merit,

MAN is formed with a general disposition to affect what he PART I.
conceives to be good. If his conception be just, his affection CHAP. I.


will be proper and free from caprice or unaccountable passions. Y

But as the conceptions of men are not always taken from the 
ordinary course of things, but sometimes from singular accidents,
from contagion and fashion, from the affectation of singularity,
or peculiar habits of thinking any way contracted, it frequently happens that the conception misleads the affecion.

Qualities, agreeable or disagreeable, are associated with things 
in their own nature indifferent; and things indifferent, under fuich aflbciations, become objects of capricious desire or aversion.
The phial which contained a nauseous drug being associated with what it once contained, may continue to nauseate after it is empty or clean.

Language, as we obfcrvcd, is the great field of arbitrary affociation,

PART. I. ciation, in which meaning is connected with found so firmly that CHAIT. xI1 it is almost impossible to separate or to distinguish their effects.
tc w-^ Words of reproach provoke, and expressions of regard conciliate,

as a cause produces an effect, when most firmly connected in the arrangements of nature.

In such instances, the terms that oblige or offend have an obliging or an offensive meaning; and we may easily understand how a thing, in its own nature indifferent, should produce either pleasure or displeasure, if it obtrude on the mind the fubje& or occasion of such emotions. This is an effect of our associating the objec of passion with a thing that is otherwise indifferent.
But, as an affecion or passion may, by contagion or otherwise,
be repeatedly incurred, together with the presentment of an objet or occasion, of itself, no way fit to excite such emotion; in every such cafe, there seems to arise a habit of associating together occasions 'and passions, without the intervention of any thing that can be confidered as the natural object of the latter. Thus,
we fee persons terrified where there is no ordinary cause of fear; persons flutter with hope and desire, when there is no suppofeable good in their profpe&; and such paifions are known to operate with the greatest force where the objet is altogether nameless and unknown. Observe the awe with which the devotee is asseted, on feeing the priest perform his silent duties at the altar; or on hearing the solemn founds of devotion in a language which he does not understand. Here, if there be any objeat of veneration, it is such as the mind has fancied to itself after the passion has been excited: And the person is perhaps the more strongly affeeted, that he is left to guess at the cause, or that the cause is supposed too mysterious for him to conceive. The paradife of fools has ever a reference to some nameless and inconceivable state of cnjoyment.

3 It 
It may indeed be difficult to underfiand how the habit of at- PART Io 


taching affeeion or paflion to a mere blank, or privation of any .
objet whatever, could be at all acquired ; and it must be con- '-<_
sessed that, if the presentment of an object, fit to excite the passion by association or otherwise, were necefrary, we never could have acquired any such habit. The existence of an objet, indeed may be assumed, even while we labour under perfelt ignorance of its nature. Thus, we may fancy an occasion of joy,
when we hear the shouts of triumph, or an occasion of terror when we hear the cries of despair; and we may take part in the emotions of either kind, on the supposition of an objec, which we magnify the more, that we know not what it is, as well as from sympathy with those who appear to be greatly asseted.

Paflions are thus communicated from one person to another 
by contagion, without any communication of thought, or knowledge of the cause; and the person, to whom a paflion is so communicated, may mistake for the objec of it some trifling incident or circumfrance, which happens to accompany the emotion.

If the nurse should shriek, or give signs of horror, while a rat 
or a mouse is passing on the floor, her child being infected with terror, may from thenceforward attach similar emotions to the appearance of a similar cause.

But, in whatever manner the fact be explained, it cannot be 
doubted, that sentiments of great force are produced on frivolous occasions: As the paflfons of enthufiafin or fuperfititon are attached to forms of expression or gesture, in their own nature indifferent or void of any meaning; the moftungovernable feelings 
cf 
PA RT I. of horror are incurred on the presentment of things harmless or useful, such as the most familiar domestic animals, or the most SEC'r. XII.
LNVw 'ordinary and salutary species of food. Of one person, we are 
told, the hair will stand on end on the appearance of a cat; of another, that he will sicken and faint at the smell of cheese, or the fight of a particular joint of meat. Such capricious fears or aversions are commonly termed antipathies, and probably must have originated in early childhood, or under the effecs of disease;
and acquire the force of habit, before the reason of the thing could be questioned; so that they remain through life no less a mystery, to the person who is fubjeaed to them, than they are to others who behold their effects.

Antipathies, to any particular species of food, we may suppose to 
originate in some excessive or unseasonable use of it, that may have made a lasting impression of harm on the animal frame; but, in many instances of the fame kind, there is more of mental perturbation, or panic terror, than of a mere loathing and distaste as,
feding the organs of sense.

Of such prepolfeflions, it is remarkable that they are more frequently of the nature of repugnance or horror, than of fond predilection and joy. This is perhaps agreeable to the general order of nature, under which supposed evils are more powerful to deter, than supposed good to allure and conciliate.

What seems, among the examples of predilection and fond defire, to form the nearest counterpart to the antipathies now Rfatcd, is the admiration with which titles and badges of honour,
the coloured turban in Asia, the ribband and the star in Europe,
the fincry of drefi and of equipage in all the world throughout,

are 
are fondly admired and coveted even by those who Teem to at- PART I.
tach their affetion to the external appearance alone. ECHAP.I

Examples of such capricious affedion, whether inclining to admiration or horror, originated probably in some casual imprefsion, or carry an association with something- by which the mind is strongly affected; and it lhould seem that, in many instances, vehement emotion is equivalent to strong conviction of reality in its objeCt: So that, in proportion as subjects are fupbfed to be of great concern, we are rash in forming our notions, and tenacious of the errors or mistakes we have committed in refped to them.

Upon this foot, we are often precipitant in conceiving the objets, whether of superstition, enthusiasm, or ardent ambition:
And strong passions of this fort once entertained seem to shut up the mind against conviction of error. Superstition precludes inquiry or doubt respecting the merit of its object, as so many acts of profaneness. Ambition rejets every question relating to the estimate of elevation or rank, as tending to degradation and meanness. You may convince a person that he has n-ittaken his interest, but seldom that he has mistaken his religion or his honour.

It is well known, in the history of mankind, that sentiments of 
devotion, whether genuine or false, may be aflociated with external rites of any description: with rites, in their own nature trivial or indifferent; or with rites, materially adverse to the safety and welfare of mankind.

Rites, in their own nature indifferent or innocent, are mere VOL. I. T arbitary 
PART I arbitrary signs of the devotion they are used to express; and, being SHcAP.I 0on the foot of eftabliihed language, it were absurd to contest \vowY their meaning, on the ground of their not having any original 
connection with the thing signified. They may be confidered as the form, in which the thoughts and affections of men are made known; as such are entitled to regard; and, being set apart to express the most important of meanings, are to be observed with proportional attention and refpea.

It should teem that, when rites, in their physical effecs, are 
of a cruel or pernicious tendency, the errors of superstition, or the principle which can inspire [such cruelties, ihould be easily detected and set aside. There is however reason to apprehend the reverse.

To the mind which is tainted with fuperititious fears, the external rite is the more congenial that it is horrid and cruel. Under the influence of such dispositions, the human sacrifice appears an adequate tribute of homage to the objeCt of devotion; the charnel house, or repository of the dead, a proper place of worfliip;
and every circumfiance that contributes to dejection and terror,
suitable accompanyments of the work that is to be executed.

Such conjectures are confirmed by the practice of superstitious 
nations, in many instances; and recently, by the accounts we have received of the rites, which are praCtised in some of the lately difcovered islands of the Pacific ocean, and among men otherwise of mild and innoffenfive dispositions. We find them give way to the affinity of passions, in passing from the effect of a cruel rite to the feelings of an abjeCt superstition; in passing from the human sacrifice, and from the fight of the dead, to the homage they would pay to an angry spirit.

J

It is indeed known, from less affecting examples, that we ea- PART. I.



fily pass from an agreeable or disagreeable sentiment of one kind, 
to another of the fame general tendency; from benevolence and N
esteem to hope and joy; or from malice and envy to melancholy,
fear, and despair.

As fuperRfition is so easily formed, so tenacious of its errors, and 
so forcible in its effecs, it is not surprising that persons of a designing ambition have softered it in themselves, whilst they employed it as an engine to work up the minds of other men to their purpose. Such adventurers appear to have been successful,
in proportion as they have set reason aside, and substituted unaccountable caprice instead of any just or virtuous sentiment of the mind.

Next to superstition, or religious enthusiasm, the associations of 
honour, whether imaginary or real, are observed to be of the most powerful effec in the government of mankind. Here the conception once entertained cannot be violated without incurring a sense of a degradation and meanness. Upon this ground, we admire the fashions of high rank, its titles and badges of honour,
its retinue, equipage, or dress; and fortune, however powerfully recommended from the consideration of interest, is still more admired and eagerly pursued, as a constituent of rank. Even pleasure owes its principal charm to the distinction it gives; and the sumptuous table of the rich is more flattering to his vanity than it is to his palate.

c/TV of man. It inspires the feeble sex, in the feeblest race of mankind, to seek for death in its most terrific and cruel forin *. It is effeeual, not only in procuring transient efforts on great and remarkable occasions, but fixes in the mind also unremitted and steady attachment to the objeds of ambition, whether assumed by prejudice, or feleded with wife discernment.

The vulgar have most commonly stated to themselves the attainment of power, preferment, or fame, as amounting to elevation and greatness; and the passion, which results from such apprehensions, is known to be an unremitted, as well as a forcible,
motive of ascion: In frequency it is equal, in force it is superior,
to interest itself. What pity, that examples of its power are more frequent in cafes where it is milled by false association,
than where it proceeds on a discernment of real worth, and where it inspires a just elevation of mind ! But such is the condition of man, in this firit period of his progress from ignorance to knowledge; during which, his nearest way to the perception of truth lies through the experience of mistake and error.

Inequalities of men we may conceive to have been at first observed in the person endowed with different measures of strength,
whether of body or mind; and may suppose that person to have been esteemed most noble, who possessed most of the qualities 
which

which every one wilied to find in his friend, unfllaken fidelity, PART 1.

.

Such we may believe to have been the standard of estimation,

while persons remained undiftinguiflied by fortune or casual advantages. But, together with diRinctions of fortune, amounting to inequalities of condition, perhaps leading to superior attainment or elevation of mind, we may suppose an association of superior dignity and worth to have taken place. The effects of wealth, indeed, in procuring attention and submission, keep pace with the effeds of merit, in procuring efleem and affe&ion. The vulgar can seldom distinguish them; and the order of society Ibmetimes requires that even the most discerning liould not difpute their effects, or refuse to fortune the consideration of rank.
It is well if the ordinary race of men retain any sense of personal merit, or escape the contagion of baseness; which can perceive no ground of elevation but riches, no objeCt of refpea but prosperity and power.

Whoever has formed his conception of greatness amidif the 
pageantrics of an Asiatic court, or has suffered his mind to be infected with awe, from the operations of power, in actions of cruelty and caprice, will be ready to do homage wherever like signs of elevation are held forth to his view.

His veneration will be excited by the contemptuous looks, or,

what he may be pleated to call, the lofty air of the monarch. He willtake his impression of greatness even from the robe in which he is drefled, from the sceptre which he holds in his hand, from the crown, or the turban fludded with jewels, which rcfts on his brow.

In this proflitution of refped, it is paid to the jealous, efncminatc,

PAKl.- I. minate, and cruel tyrant, still more than to the affectionate father,
SC,,H II and heroic guardian of his people.


Similar attachments of esteem and contempt, to the external 
circumstances and conditions of men, are observable through every rank of life; and, such is the effect of fuperioriry, when admitted upon any pretence, that it exalts whatever is associated with it, and degrades whatever is opposed to it.

If rank be founded in riches; wealth, wherever it appears, is 
confidered as reputable; and the want of it, in every shape, incurs contempt or neglect. Its pretence or absence warps the judgement in matters of beauty or deformity, of convenience or inconvenience, as well as of merit and demerit *: And the desire tobe what the vulgar admire,often condemns the ambitious to forego every other source of enjoyment, in private; to incur perpetual care, suffering, and distress, in order that they may carry, in their public appearances, the established marks of diflinction and fafliion. How many submit to be wretched at home, in order to appear happy abroad !

This principle of estimation, indeed, whether well or ill applied, is known to be of sovereign influence in the government of mankind; and it is of the highest moment, in the policy of nations, that it fllould be directed aright. Wherever the flandard of elevation and honour is erected, thither will the passions of men be pointed, and the most ardent efforts of fortitude and magnanimity be made.

tions of a particular kind, under casual emergencies: And it is,
no doubt, of the greatest moment, to review our habitual conceptions and paflions ; and, above all, to examine the fubjeds to which we attach our feelings of esteem and contempt.

Such is the force of association Pn these matters, and such its

Of Will and Freedom of Choice.

PARTr II. IAN is conscious of his power to chute among the objeAts that C'AP. 1I.
 occur to him; and is conscious of the considerations on which,

w "\ ' ,in any particular initance, he has made his choice. He may 
have inclinations to which he does not give way, and inducements which he is able to withstand. His person may be restrained to any particular place; it may be driven by force in any particular diredcion. He may even feel passions of fear or hope,
constraining him to chufe what he is willing to avoid; but is conscious that his being willing or unwilling, in any particular instance, can proceed from no cause but himself: The part he is willing to take is his own; and he alone is accountable for the choice he has made.

The power of choice is a fadl of which the mind is conscious:

It is therefore supportcd by the highest evidence of which any i-a is susceptible. Attempts to support it by argument are nugatory, and attempts to overthrow it by argument are absurd.

q~~~~~~~~3 ~The 
The axiom, that every effec muit have a cause, cannot bring PART. I.
any new light on this fubje&. The axiom itself is not better 


known than the sac, that will is free, and truths are certainly co consistent one with the other. The consciousness of freedom hath been termed a deceitful feeling; but why not the axiom, that every effeA muff have a cause, a deception also ? If we fay the axiom is a necessary truth; it may be so when well understood.
Effec is correlative to cause, and they are inseparable; but there may be existence without any cause external to itself, as there may be will without any cause but the mind that is willing.

Every rational ation, indeed, has a motive; for the very purpose which constitutes rationality is itself a motive: But, may not the mind determine itself; and, amidst the considerations or objects which are presented to its choice, be the cause of its own determination? If there be always a consideration upon which minds are willing or unwilling, it were absurd, nevertheless, to confider volition as an aa of necessity, not of choice. Such subftitutions of mechanical imagery, in this, as in many other instances, serve to mislead our conception. Under such images,
the mind, in the midst of its motives, is conceived as a tennis ball impelled at once in many directions, while it can move but in one direction. Will is the direAion of mind, and is always such as it receives from some one of its motives. Here the analogy,
though far from being perfect, is supposed to convey the idea of necefity from matter to mind: For what know we else of necessity, it is said, but that an effect ever follows its cause ?

In this cae, however, we endeavour to confound matters which are far fom being alike. The effea on the tennis ball is 
VOL. 1. U not 
PART I. not conformable to'any one impression, but is a compound of all.
CRAP. II.
I Did the body, which is struck by opposite forces, take account k-r'vy of their number, direction, and power, and, upon a fair estimate 
of that which was strongest, chufe to move in the direction of some determinate force, the analogy would be complete;, but the inference to be drawn upon this supposition, instead of extending neceflity to mind, would communicate freedom to matter.

The consideration that infinite power must have preordained_

the operations of will, and that there operations therefore cannot be free, is an argument taken by conjecture from a collateral subjea, to overthrow a fad of which we are conscious.

The implication of universal prescience in the perfect intelligence of God, from which we would infer, that every future event is no leis certainly future, than that every past event is certainly past, is an argument of the fame kind. We would rejeA a faA that is perfetly within our cognizance, on the credit of an argument taken from a subjea that is beyond our reach. We know not the nature of divine omniscience; and, if the Almighty hath opened a source of contingence in nature, we may suppose that contingence itself is a perfecion in his works. Who can doubt that intelligence is a quality of the highest order in the scale of created being; and that discernment and freedom of choice are essential to intelligent beings.

The knowledge which we ascribe to the Author of nature comprehends, no doubt, whatever may result from the source of contingence, which he has opened in the freedom of his intelligent 
gent creatures,and his almighty providence is sufficient to controul PART I.
the effects of such freedom. He foresees, we conceive, that abfo- CHAP. IL
.

lute evil under such government cannot befal the universe : for .Wa whatever be the contingent effec of freedom, it is ever fufceptible of remedy and it is ever good that intelligent beings should be free.

The decrees of almighty power are not less eternal in being 
made at any one point of duration in preference to another. The date of their existence is ever present. Such is the eternal Now,
to which we sometimes strive, but perhaps in vain, to elevate our thoughts on this subjet.

The consequence which the fatalist would draw from the supposed necessity of human action, is likewise absurd. The neceffity consists in the relation of motive and will. Every choice, no doubt, proceeds on a motive; for the purpose, which is supposed in every ad of intelligence, is itself a motive: But how absurd for the fatalist to plead that he is not accountable for having committed a bad action; under pretence that his intention itself,
which was the motive or cause of such acion, was bad ! It is evident that the inference should be, not impunity to the person who acts from a bad motive, but the expedience of employing some counter motive to restrain the bad one: And this precisely is the nature of punishment, whether operating by neceflity or choice.

After all, in treating of the human will, the names of liberty 
and ncccflity may be disputed; but notorious fadts are foundation enough, upon which we may safely erect the fabric of moral fcicncc, to far as it is of any importance to mankind.


PART I. Every person knows that, if he is detained or drawn along by 
r.PIII. 1 force, he has no choice, and is not responsible for the confevW^ quences: That, if a sac be made evident to him, he has no 
choice, and must know or believe it to be true; all he can do is to examine the evidence, and abide by the effects. But if he be ofsered a price for his house, though more than the value, he has a choice, and may reject or accept of the offer at pleasure. In the former instances, he was conitrained by force, or by evidence,
and is not accountable: But in this he aas for himself, and may be to blame. If he be in his senses, indeed, he will have a reason for what he does; but still he is himself the person who aAs, and who by his choice may incur the highest measures of censure;
as, by mistaking the truth, he may incur the imputation of weakness and folly: And, on these considerations reft the foundations of moral wisdom and intelleAual industry in the search of truth, in whatever manner we apply the terms of liberty or necessity to one or the other.

Of the Nature and Origin of Moral Science.
PHYSICAL Science has been confidered as an article in the PART I.



history of mind proceeding from the observation of particu- 
lars; leading, by means of abftracion and generalization, to a comprehensive view of the system or actual state of things; and terminating in the completion of all that man is able to attain,
in the exercise of what are termed his cognitive powers.

The consideration of moral science, no less an article in the 
history of mind, has been reserved for this place, that it might follow the statement of will, and other functions of what has been termed the power ative.

This branch of science relates to human nature, stated under the 
aspea already mentioned, of its specific excellence and defet,
and regards the diftinAion of good and evil.

Other diftindions interest the curiosity of men; but on the 
diftinadion 
PART. I. diflindion of good and evil, are founded the opposite conditions S CTi °.i 
V of happiness and misery. Men are warned'of its importance in ~<o<v 'every inflance of enjoyment or suffering, of honour or dishonour,

of fatisfadtion and peace of mind, or remorse of conscience, selfreprobation, and shame.

As men are, to one another, mutually the most important objeds of the scene in which they are placed, and the characters of good and evil are equally obvious to their observation of one another, as in the consciousness which every one has of himself;
varieties, which they exhibit, in this refped, have a proportional sway over the emotions and passions incident to the human heart; their effects appear in the sentiments of approbation or disapprobation; esteem or contempt, veneration and love;
or, indignation, detestation, and scorn, of which parties, in the commerce of life, by their opposite characters, are the occasion and the objects.

The occasions on which men are so affected with sentiments of 
complacency or reprobation, command their attention beyond any other consideration in nature; insomuch that pictures of manners are, of all other fubjedts, the most interesting to the human mind. Hence the principal charm of hiflory, on which the actions and characters of men are detailed; of poetry, in which representations, fictiious or real, are made ; even of moral discourse, when the fubjets of admonition, injunction, and precept are, by ajuft recommendation, brought home to the feelings of eftecm or contempt.

'With such delineations of manners, the great critic would inflrtud his pupils to captivate the cars, even of the multitude,

HOR. DE ARTE POETICA, V. 317.

As there never was a nation so flupid as not to observe the firit 
simple laws of motion, gravitation, and elasticity; nor so artless as not to apply these laws to the ordinary purposes of human life;
so there never was a people who did not perceive and apply the diftindions of right and wrong, in the most decided exprefflons of efteein or contempt, of applause and censure. How they may have proceeded from the first and most limited observations of a physical law, which is the origin of science in one of its branches; or, from the apprehension of a moral law, on which this other branch of science is founded; to a more enlarged, luminous,
and comprehensive fyflem of either kind, we may, under the title of man's pursuits and attainments, have occasion to slate as a part in the history of his progreflive nature. In the mean time,
we may endeavour to collect the first canons of reason, with refpea to the conduct of moral enquiries, as we did those which relate to the investigation of physical laws, or the general arrangement of fadts.

Sciences of there different clafes agree in the general condition 
of their being a knowledge of the laws of nature, and of their applications : But the laws of nature may be differently understood,
and differently applied. A physical law of nature is a general Itatc of what is uniform or common in the order of things, and 
i,

PART I. is addressed to the powers of perception and sagacity. A moral law of nature is equally general,'though an expreflion not of a  a 
sac, but of what is good; and is addressed to the powers of eftimation and choice.

Refpeding the fubjeas of moral law, whatever may be their 
atual condition, the law does not state what is, but enjoins what ought to be done or avoided.

Physical law is applied to the formation of theory, or the explanation of phenomena; and is the foundation of power. Moral law is applied to determine the choice of voluntary agents,
and suggest the purpose to which their power is or ought to be employed.

As, in physical science, our objea is to investigate and comprehend the adual state of things, no mere hypothesis or fuppofition can be admitted among the laws of nature: And, in moral science, our object being to determine a choice of what is best, no mere fad can be adduced to preclude our endeavours to obtain,
in any subjeS, what is better than its atual slate.

Among fads or realities, therefore, moral estimation being direCed to what is good, independent of the fa&, the'firft, or the fundamental law of morality, relating to man, independent of what men aAually are, must be an expression of the greatefr good to which human nature is competent. It is held forth as the principal objet of cultivation and study. And, if there should be a greater good than that which is so held forth, the foundation of science we have laid is defetive, and the efforts of cultivation and study are misplaced.

i To 
To substitute theory, even of mind, for moral science would PART. I.



be an error and an abuse. This abufe,indeed, has been incurred 
by many, who take the diftintion of physical and moral science V
from the fubjeds to which they relate, not from the objects to which they are directed. Physical science they suppose to be a knowledge of fubjets material; moral science, a knowledge of mind, or offubjedts intellecual: And they accordinglyplace theoretical speculation on the subjea of mind, among the discussions of moral philosophy. In their apprehension, moral approbation and disapprobation are mere phenomena to be explained; and,
in such explanations their science of morals adually terminates.
The phenomena of moral approbation have been supposed no 'a more than a diversified appearance of the consideration that is paid to private interest, to public utility, to the reason of things;
or they have been supposed to result from the sympathy of one man with another.

But if moral sentiment could be thus explained into any thing 
different from itself, whether interest, utility, reason or fympathy, this could amount to no more than theory. And it were difficult to fay to what effedt knowledge is improved, by refolving a first adt of the mind into a second, no way better known than the firfft. The effect of a theory so applied, for the most part, has been to render the diftindtion of good and evil more faint than it commonly appears under the ordinary expressions of eIteem and love, or of indignation and scorn.

Whatever we substitute for an object of moral estimation, is 
thereby set up as an objeA of predilection and cultivation. If v c fubIlitute utility or profit, for the flandard of moral good, it 
VOL. I. X mull 
PA.R I. must follow,that tobevirtuous and intereJfed, are synonymous terms.
 Or if, for virtue, we substitute any thing that is of a mean nature,
I"q.XI.a as when we substitute pride for elevation of mind, it is evident 
that we do not so much mislead the efforts of men, as stifle the very principle, from which they are bent on the improvement of their own nature. If sympathy is admitted as the principle of moral estimation, it is evident that we admit, as a standard of good, what may itself, on occasion, be erroneous and evil, or what ought not to be esteemed beyontl where it is just and proper;
limits which presuppose that that there is a prior flandard of moral estimation, by which even -the reAitude of sympathy itself is to be judged.

This standard, it is the object of moral philosophy to afcertain, and to apply, in estimating the reason of different men,
their sympathies and their antipathies, the good or the evil they incur in every at of the mind, and in every instance throughout the condunt of life.

To a being susceptible of happiness or misery, the laws of 
nature, according to which these opposite conditions are difpenfed, cannot have escaped observation. The investigation and application of them, accordingly, whether well or ill performed,
may be confidered as an operation essential to the intelligent nature of man; and is that branch in the history of the human mind which we term Moral Philosophy.

Of the Sources of Religion among Mankind.

AMONG the works in whichman exhibits a variety of invention PAR I.

have'iot any reference to his ordinary wants, nor any tendency to 'v compleat his accommodations. Such are edifices conftruaed neither for his lodgement nor for his defence; temples, and plaCes of worship, in which he gives signs of intercourse with some :owers invisible, or ihews the apprehension of a presence greatly :aperior to that of his fellow creatures.

The perception of intelligent power operating in nature is faniliar, and a principal diftindlion in the description of man. No 'ribe is so brutish, fays Cicero, as not to know that there is a God,
although they may not know what conception to form of his :haraAer .

X 2 On 
' Nulla gens tam sera, qute non fciat deum habendum effe, quamvis ignoret qualem :>bcre deceat.

De Natura Peorium.

PART I. On this firit general point, therefore, mankind do not appear 
 to need information.

Among the nations of the antient world, the greater part, if 
not the whole, had their creed or system of theology, an order of priesthood, a form of worship, and altars erected to the known or unknown God. In the new world, even where such eftabliflments were wanting, nations did not incur the charge of brutality mentioned by Cicero: For, even amongtP them, references to the intelligent power that governs the world were familiarly made or received.

What then, may we ask, is the origin of this apprehension ? and 
whether does it conduat the human mind in the progress of information, and in the maturity of its conceptions ? Does man perceive in the aspee and operations of nature, the prefente and meaning of intelligent power, as he perceives in the aspet and works of his fellow-creatures, a mind like his own, furnished with similar faculties and corresponding intentions ?

To these queflions we may answer, That, if the apprehension 
of a final cause or design implies the perception of intelligence,
if design be the incommunicable attribute of mind, and if there be in the nature of things any intimation of final cause or design,
thither we may refer the first apprehension of intelligent power in the system of nature.

It may be difficult to fix the point from which this intimation 
at firfI was given. In the rudest, or most simple fate of the human fpccies, it may have occurred from the fitness of parts in the conftrultion of tfbjcas the mono familiar, or from great and alarming 
larming occasions that roused the mind to apprehend the inten- PART I.
tion of some power to interrupt, or break in upon the ordinary 

SECT. V.
course of things. r 
It is, however, probable, that the apprehension of a beneficent 
design in nature had its source in some instance that is really fitted to justify such a conception: As in the exquisite conftrudion and obvious design which appear in the fabric of animal organs.
These, in the cafe of every animal, are accompanied with an inflinCtive direction to the use of them. The chick, almost as soon as he has escaped from the shell, runs at his food, and picks with the bill. The quadruped, when he drops from the dam, steps'
with his feet upon the ground, and gropes for the dug, from which he is to derive his nourishment. This inflintive direction, when combined with intelligence in the nature of man, amounts to a perception that the organ was made for the purpose to which it is applied. Who ever doubted that the eye was made to fee, the ear to hear, the mouth to receive, and the teeth to grind his food; that the foot was made to 'ftep on the ground; the hand to grasp, or enable him to seize and apply things proper for his use.

This perception of design in nature still accompanies the human mind in its views, whether contraited or enlarged, whether limited to the organization of a single animal or plant, or reaching to the combination of parts indefinitely multiplied in the terreftrial or solar systems. The part bears impreflions of design,
which continues to be perceived with increasing evidence in the conftrudion of the whole.

This fabric of nature, so fitly organizcd in the fiame of every 
indlividua ll 
PART I. individual is organized also in the assemblage of many individuals nto one system, whether of the earth which they inhabit, or of S cr. XV.
w-Y"jV 'the fun and planets of which this earth itself is but a part: So 
that the fame characer of design, which the most ignorant may read in the first aspet of things that most nearly concerns them,
the learned may read also throughout the whole system or volume of nature.

Whether this leflon, to be taken from the aspea of things, be 
obvious to every beholder, or only to a few of superior discernment, and from them communicable and easily received by the ordinary class of men, we may not be able to determine, and is not of moment to our present argument, in accounting for religion as the gift of nature, to every nation and to every age. For, in every nation, and in every age, the few may be found who are fit to receive and communicate to others the apprehension of design in the works of God.

By this magnificent piece of inftruation, man is finally let 
into the secret of his own destination; and is enabled to become a conscious and a willing instrument in the hand of his Maker for the completion of his work.

Among the foundations, on which the difference of right and 
wrong is supposed to reft, the will of God, commanding the one, and forbidding the other, is by some assumed as the only real ground of diftindion.

The will of God is, no doubt, of supreme authority; and 
where that is known, we need not recur to any other: But, it has pleated him that his will, at least in the first intimation of it,

should 
should be declared by means of the order eflabliflied in his PART I.
works. And in our conduct of life, the opposite natures of right CHAP. I.

SEqT. XV.

and wrong are our fafelt guides, in every particular instance, to _
the performance of what the will of God has required. It is in search of a model, and of a patron of whatis previously known to be right, that we arrive at our best and our highest conceptions of the Supreme Being.

This conception, if we take it at a medium of what nations in 
general have possessed, is to be valued, rather as indicating a capacity of farther attainment, than as a blessing already compleat. It is, like other articles in the progreflive and variable nature of man, a foundation on which he may build; a germ which, in the progress of his nature, may wax to indefinite magnitude and strength; or, if we may still vary the image, it may be confidered as one of the rude materials on which he himself is to exert his talent for art and improvement.

It is so much the disposition of man to operate on his first 
materials, whether by extending or improving them, or by straining them to the model of tome favourite prepoffeflion, asfedion or passion; that it is probable we may no where find the conception of God in the fame form which it bore when first collected from the appearance of things in the world.

As the wife and the happy may have raised and enlarged their 
conception of this object, the brutish and the depraved may have corrupted and funk it far below the level even of ordinary reason.

The Author of nature, in creating, we may observe, appears disposed to a limited variety of kinds and species, but descends 
to,

PART. I. to indefinite multiplicity and discrimination of individuals.
 Many individuals conflitute but one species, and many species SECr. XV.
SWco. XV but one genus or kind. The system of nature itself is one, consifting of many orders and classes of being; and a design which is apparent in every part, results in a design that is common to the whole. Neither in the necessity of an efficient cause, nor in any appearance of a divided purpose, is there any reason to apprehend a plurality of gods: Yet so little are the bulk of mankind qualified to pursue a series of observation and thought, without any mixture of error, that Polytheifin has been more frequent than Theism; or the belief of many gods, more frequent than the belief of one supreme intelligent power. And nations have made up a lift of their gods upon a model, taken from the human race, numerous and diftinguiflable by sex and age, as well as by disposition and rank.

These are the great and prevailing errors of the human mind,

in pursuing its first apprehension of intelligent power, supposed to exist in the .condud of nature.

It is in correcting such errors, and in observing the order of 
Providence, that the human mind is likely to advance in that part of its progress which relates to this subjec : And which, indeed, is the completion of all the advantages which man is enabled to obtain in the progress of his intellectual faculties.

Although polytheifin favours of a prepofleffion which man has 
taken fiom the analogy of his own nature, and from the diverfity of character in the multitude of men ; yet, it is probable, that the plurality of Gods did not originate in the conception of any single pcrfon, but was an aggregate of the conceptions which difnercnt men had formed upon the fggcflion of their own si3 tuations,

tuations, and the peculiar circumstances in which they were PART I.
placed. 
placed. SETr XV.

In every nation or tribe, the providence of God was supposed 
to take its characer from the circumstances in which it was employed. In maritime fituatiois, the deity was conceived as monarch of the sea, and director of storms. Within land, he was conceived as the patron of hufbanidmen and of Ihepherds,
the ruler of seasons, and the power on which man muff depend for the increase of his herds, and for the returns of his harvest.

In no instance, perhaps, did the people of any one description 
or determinate manner of life, originally conceive more than one God: But the accounts of what different nations believed, when collated together, seemed to make up a catalogue of separate deities; and what every nation apart intended for one, when reports were accumulated from different quarters, was mistaken for many.

The spirit with which these reports of a God acknowledged 
in one nation, different from the God who was acknowledged in another, were mutually received by their refpeftive votaries, was various in different inflances. In some intfances, the pretensions of one deity were supposed to be consistent with those of another,
and the Gods reconcileable. Upon this supposition, every nation worflipped its own, without any supposed disparagement to the God of its neighbour, and without animosity to his worflippers.

In other instances, pretensions were confidered as inconsistent;

deities were stated as rival powers; and nations waged continual war under the banners of their refpedivc gods.

Vol. . . Y It 
PART . It has become a proverbial expreflion, that the abuse of the CHaP. II.
SEcT.XIV. best things becomes the worst; and this, no doubt, has been t^vw-y verified in the abuse of religion. Though in the proper use 
of it, the highest and the most beneficial attainment of human nature, in the abuse, it has become the source of great evil; a bar to knowledge and freedom of thought; a source of rancour, malice, revenge, and cruelty, beyond any other principle of depravation incident to the mind of man.

Polytheifin, perhaps, was innocent, compared to the otherwife false apprehension of a deity to be gratified with ams of debasement and horror, or the observance of rites, not only frivolous, but pernicious to mankind.

Where the God to be served is conceived to be an evil spirit,

offended by trivial neglecs, and appeased by as trivial performances, he is worshipped more from fear and distrust, than from confidence and love: Not with the fear that results from the consciousness of guilt, and is so far conformable to the dictates of reason; but a fear that results from the uncertainty of what man has to experc from a capricious power, having an object to pursue for himself at the expence of his creatures.

The vulgar, accordingly, in barbarous ages, apprehended the 
God to whom their worlhip was addrefied as a jealous tyrant,
against whose exacion of services, and caprice of will, they had no security in pursuing any course of life even the most fair and inoffensive which reason can suggest. When calamity besel them they had recourse to divination to' discover the cause;
and seemed to believe, that the rod of divine anger was ever

Even the learned are not always qualified to correct these 
errors, or rightly to interpret the signs ofwifdom, goodness and justice, which are held forth in the government of the world. Infomuch that the reality of any such meaning, in the system of nature, has been contested with much ingenuity, and appearance of argument, of which we ihall confider the foundation in the following fedion.

Of the Origin of Evil.

-- - What in me is dark,

What, to the height of this great argument,

And juflify the ways of God to men.

PART I. THIS is the great humbling block which the Atheist opposes to  the entrance of religion, and which the Theiil ever firives to reST.XVI. move.

move.

We are told, by those who attempt this arduous talk, that the 
order of nature requires the observance of general laws, even where the cffet, in particular initances, may be hurtful; and 
that 
that the complaints of evil in human life arise merely from the PART. 1.
shocks of private interest with universal convenience. CHCT.XV1.

SEcT.XVI.

However fatisfacory this account of the matter may be to 
those who are familiar with the conceptions of universal order or general good, the bulk of mankind look no farther than to the ground of their own complaints; and hold that to be evil in nature by which man is aggrieved. Their complaints may be more effedually silenced, if it be made to appear, that this order of things is suited to the nature of man, and of every created intelligence; and therefore required in a system, of which intelligent being is the capital form or highest class of existence.

On the foot of fair inquiry, which is never more proper than 
in treating such important queflions, we are to slate the subject,
and then to confider whether there be enough, in the defects of man's condition and frame, to refute the firfi suggestions of ai existing power, supremely beneficent as well as wife.

The works of nature are indefinitely varied; insomuch, that 
variety itself appears to be an objed in the formation of them.

Throughout the kingdom of mineral, vegetable, and animal,

there is a continual diversity of'kind, species, and individual:
Yet, throughout the whole of every kingdom, there runs a certain analogy; there is a difiribution of qualities, a chain of connecion and mutual subserviency, which renders the vetige of intelligent power the more evident, that parts are so various, while they are so happily ranged and connected.

Parts 
PART I. Parts that conflitute the system of nature, like the flones of an a  arch, support arid are supported; but their beauty is not of the 
rvw'x. quiescent kind. The principles of agitation and of life combine 
their effecs in constituting an order of things, which is at once fleeting and permanent. The powers of vegetation and animal life come in aid of mechanical principles; the whole is alive and in action: The scene is perpetually changing; but, in its changes,
exhibits an order more striking than could be made to arise from :he mere position or description of any forms entirely at reft.

Man, with his intellectual powers, placed at the top of this terreitrial scale, like the key-stone of the arch, completes the fyflem.
His vestige on the earth is marked with continual efforts of peculiar design, to which the form which material fubjeds had previously assumed, is ever made to give way. His favourite plants and animals are propagated. Whatever is noxious or unserviceable to him, his rivals and his enemies, are suppressed. The superfluous forest is cleared; marshes are drained; or ways are opened for Itagnating waters to reach the lea. His property is set apart:
His field is cultivated: Cities are built: He himself, or the pro.dudions of his art, every where crowd on the view, and become the principal objeA of the scene. He is even met on the trackless ocean, and employs the currents of air and of water to aid:
him in the movements which he is disposed to perform.

The genius of variation, which is so eminent in comparing 
different species of being together, is carried into the economy with which the fame species, in refpet to the individuals that compose it, is continually changing; and the generations that were and are, haften to make way for those which are to come.

In this wonderful scene, the power that works was originally PART I.



creative, and is equally so in every successive period of time. SEcT.XVI.
While the things that were are passing away, things that were not r are brought into being. Not only individuals are made to succeed one another, but new forms and varieties of aspec and stature,
are made to succeed in the fame individual. From the first germ .of every vegetable, from the embryo in every animal, there is a progress to the maturity of its kind; and from thence a decline and continual approach to its dissolution.

This progress assets man in his intellecual and moral nature,

no less than in his growth, or in his approach to the perfect slate,
and the decline of his vegetative and animal powers. He sets out without knowledge, or any of its benefits, in forming his conception of things, or in directing his active propensities. His faculties and his attainments are equally progreflive. His knowledge, preceded by ignorance, originates in the mere capacity of observation and thought. He has to itruggle through the first miltaken appearances of things, by experience and continued observation to.the discovery of truth. Knowledge is the sap which nature has supplied to nourish the growing mind: Its faculties, in the mean time, take solidity and itrength from the exercise they find in collecing this nouriflament.

Labour is to man a source of enjoyment, and to the faculties 
with which he is furnished a principal means of improvement.
Arts communicate, by information and example, from the matter to his pupil, and firom a passing generation to that which succeeds it; so that the progress of the human species is not, like that of other animals, limited to the individual or to the age ; but comnmunicated fiom one to another, and continued firom age to age.

As,

PART I. As exercise is the school of intelligent power, man is every 
where flirrounded with occasions that require its exertion. He s..v'Y' finds himself beset with inconveniences, which he desires to remove; remiote from advantages which he desires to gain; and fubjeded to much difficulty, danger, disappointment, and sorrow,
in his attempts to remove the one, or to obtain the other. Every material presented to him, in its natural state, is rude, and unfit for his use. The spontaneous produce of the foil is no where fit to maintain him. Poison and food are blended together in the producdions of the earth. The noxious and the salutary are to be diftinguifled and Separated with anxious care. He is made desirous of knowledge; but the subjed of his inquiries is concealed from him under a variety of perplexing appearances. He is disposed to society; but distressed with the evils to which he finds it exposed. When his objecd is at a distance, he is flattered with hope, that when he shall have gained it, his labours will be at an end: But on his approach to the supposed end of his wishes,
he finds that his hope was deceitful, that he must engage in some other pursuit, and that his labours are still to be renewed. The very organs that render him susceptible of pleasure expose him also to an overbalance of pain.

These particulars in the lot of man are to him matters of conmplaint, and numbered with the evils that darken his apprehension relating to the providence of God: But to an indifferent fpeeator,
who compares the ador with the scene in which he is placed, or the pupil with the school to which he is sent, the whole must appear to be wifely and beneficently devised. It must appear,
that a lot, composed of objecs to be desired and shunned, is fitted to an active being, as the air is fitted to the wing of the bird,

2 the 
the water to the fin of the fiih, and its place in the system of PART I.
nature is fitted to the refpeaive ftrucure and organization of CSHAP. x every species, in the several divisions of the animal kingdom. v 
Man, though a rational foul, is endowed with animal organs,

that he may perceive and observe the system of nature around him. The wants and necessities of his animal frame are the earliest spurs to his acive exertion. His intelligent faculties are tried and whetted in pursuing appearance to reality, which the first aspec of things often serves to disguise. Having the talents of an artist, his supply is very properly made to consist in rude materials, not in finished producions, that would supercede the use of his faculties.

Among the signals which are held forth to warn him of what 
he ought to shun, or direct him to what he ought to chufe, pain is not less inlfruCive than pleasure; and the hand which inflic'ts the one is not less beneficent than that which bestows the other.
He is destined to learn, and his lot must have the severities of a school, not the pampering of sensuality and sloth. The belt mariners are formed in boisterous seas; difficulty and danger are fit occasions for the exercise and attainment of ability and courage.

To an observer, who fees the nature and destination of man 
in this point of view, the final cause will be obvious: And an evidence of the wisdom and goodness of Providence will arise from those very grounds on which the atheist is pleased to dispute tlheir reality: Proofs of goodness in the Author of nature may be collc'ed lfrom the very wants ro which man is born; fiom thelabour b is bound to perform the difficulties e is required to surmount;

VOL .
. the 
PAR 1 I. the dangers he has to encounter; and from the delays- or difapS.jCP. XI. pointments that prolong or renew his labours, and call for a ^/vo continued repetition of his toils.

We may not perceive the special neceflity of painful and adverse 
circumstances in any particular inflance; but that flich fiould be interspersed in the. lot of man, and his experience chequered with the agreeable effecs of that wisdom, which he ought to cultivate, mixed with the contrary effects of folly, which he ought to corret, is highly expedient, and well suited to his nature.

The activity of life, in the mean time, is to him not only the 
school of wisdom and of virtue, but the constituent also of pleasure and of present enjoyment.

If we attempt to conceive such a scene as the atheist contends 
would be required to evince the wisdom and goodness of God ;
a scene in which every desire were at once gratified without delay,
difficulty or trouble; it is evident, that on such supposition the end of every adcive pursuit would be anticipated, exertion would be prevented, every faculty remain unemployed, and mind itfelfno more than a consciousness of languor, under an opprefsion of weariness, such as satiety and continued inoccupation are known to produce.

On this supposition all the active powers which diftingnifh 
human nature would be superfluous, and only serve to disturb his peace, or to four the tafle of those inferiour pleasures which appear to be confiflent with indolence and sloth.

Such a scene were ill suited to this acive and aspiring being,.

for 
for whom the good to be gained is not an exemption from labour, PART I.
but the improvement of his intellectual faculties, and an ap- SCAP. A I
proach to the resemblance of that being whose good is beneficence A
and wisdom, and who kindly communicates a relish of the fame blessings to the mind of man, whose lot we are now confidering; and who is enabled to collec the existence of an Author supremely wife and beneficent from the beautiful order which is established in his works.

Such then being the character of man's nature, refpeting his 
disposition to ad, his faculties, and his preferable enjoyments.;
the propriety, for his reception, or even the necessity of a world governed by fixed laws is obvious.

If the laws are multiplied and combine their effeds to a degree 
of intricacy; his penetration is exercised in observing the conjuncTure that is formed by their joint operations; his sagacity in forecalfing the result; and his art in accommodating his measures to the end he would gain. If the laws of nature were not fixed,
all there faculties were given in vain. If there were not any fixed connedion of cause and effed, the wife could have no foresight,
nor pradife any means for the attainment of an end.

So that eftabliflled order is not more consonant to the nature 
of man, than it is in general to all intelletual being. It is the proper work of God, the proper study of man, the foundation of kill, wisdom, and art.

If any one, therefore, fliall fay, that the universe is an objed 
too vaflfor him toconceive; that he knows not what may or maynot accommodate fuchanobjedt; he may nevertheless be qualified to perZ 2 ceive 
PART I. ceive, that an eftabliihed course of things, agreeable to fixed and determinate laws, is a proper scene for the reception of intelligent S XYvI beings; that such are the superior class of existence in nature,

for whose fake all things are made: And he may venture to afunme, that whatever form of proceeding best accommodates the world of intelligence, is the proper slate of that universe in which this order of being is supreme.

It is, therefore, said with greatjuftice, that to be governed by 
fixed laws is essential to the form of nature; and that the general law is wifely and beneficently observed, even where it operates to particular inconvenience or hurt. For the wife may observe it,
learn to avail themselves of it, and avoid the inconvenience that would result from inattention or ignorance.

It appears also, that those reasoners are in a great mistake,

who think to supercede the existence of mind and Providence,
by tracing the operations of nature to their physical laws: for physical law is the charaCteristic operation of unerring mind.
The unerring mind does now what it always did, and is incapable of change; because to change would be to deviate from what is best.

So far the argument relates to the circumflances of human 
life, and to the mixture of physical evil in the lot of man: But the depravity of his own nature, and the frequency of his crimes,
are evils more real, and less reconcileable to the conception of a just and beneficent author.

To this difficulty the common solution, and belike the true one, is, that man being intelligent and free, he alone is accountable 
able for the ads of his will. The -will cannot be over-ruled to any PART I.
purpose, without transferring the moral quality from the person SECT.XVI
whose choice is so over-ruled, to the will that constrains him. rm 
Under a moral government virtue may exist and improve:

but under a mere physical necessity it can exist only in the power that imposes the necessity.

A being that is destined to acquire perfecAion must originate 
in defed ; and the permission of vice, that results for a time from this defect, is consistent with the goodness of God: Has not malice, we may be asked, a deeper root in human nature than mere error or mistake ? It may have such a root; but if error and miflake be sufficient to account, for the germ of this poisonous plant,we have no occasion to look for any root that is deeper. It is a maxim in reason, not to assume more causes than are existent in nature, and sufficient to explain the phenomena *.

Error and mistake may, no doubt, lead to competition and 
itrife, to injury and suffering. And these we know are fruitful of malice. The injurious hates, because he distrusts and fears those whom he has injured. The injured hates from indignation and resentment.

To place men in the way of incurring these sentiments, it is not 
necessary that they should have set out with a design to injure. A
mere conception of good in any matter of competition, where the success of one is detriment to another, will find the parties in a state of mutual distrust, difaffedion, and hatred.

Among the errors to which man is exposed, in his first attempts 
to : Vil. Reguls Philofophanldi Ncwtoni.

PART L to form a notion of good and evil, one is peculiarly dangerous to the peaceoffociety, and apt toempoifon themind withvice; namely,

the mitfake of precedence, or comparative advantage, whether in refpet to rank, power, or wealth, for excellence. And the consequent habit of confidering all advantages, not in respeCt to their absolute value; but in refpea to the comparative relation of less or greater which they bear to the condition of other men.
If one is to precede; others mufl be contented to follow. The eminence of one is the depression of another. Celebrity consists in being more talked of than other men; and riches in having more wealth than is common. In this point of view, the industry of one to better himself is opposition and injury to another: Men are mutually rivals, competitors, and enemies; and the occasions of difRruft, animosity, and malice, more frequent than those of confidence and good will.

Uuder fucl apprehensions of good and evil the occasions of 
jealousy and hatred accumulate in the progress of counteraCtion and strife. We may observe them particularly in the competitions for power, for fame, for love, for court preferment, and favour. To prevent them entirely, nothing more seems to be wanting, but a conception of good, limited to things, in which the success of one is confident with that of another: And, if truth leads to the knowledge of such a good we may confider the present ftatc of man, or the period of his existence that is now passing away, as but a transition to a better, in which malice, in the progress of information, will be correded; and every other evil disposition or habit, resulting from his ignorance or false apprehenfion will be suppressed.

To have moral agents in nature, the choice of their aAions mull be siee; or at molt, fubjeded to a discipline that may 
furnifli 
furnish the mind with sufficient occasions of observation and ex- PART E.
perience, to corredt its own errors, and to reform what is wrong in cCRA. If.r its dispositions or actions. The queflion, therefore, respeCting OYW
the wisdom and goodness of Providence, is, How far such a moral discipline is perceivable in the present order of things ? Is there enough, in this order, to lead intelligence in the discernment of good and evil? Are the admonitions, on the fide of morality,.
sufficient to point out the choice, and to win the affections ?

To this question we may safely answer in the affirmative. A

first notion may be erroneous, but continued experience mush lead to the truth. The consequences of error and folly are often disastrous, and always disagreeable. The consciousness of moral evil is attended with remorse, shame, and despair; that of integrity and innocence, with sentiments directly opposite: Infomuch, that the testimony of conscience, which has been emphatically termed, The Lamp of God in the Soul of Man, is a ftriking evidence of his presence to adminifler light; and to enforce the discipline, so far as it is proper to be applied, to the inftruction and guidance of a conscious and voluntary agent.

Man is entered on a progress, in which he is deflined to owe 
to himself the good or the evil incident to his nature. He has a merit in what he acquires of the one, and is responsible for what he incurs of the other. He is susceptible of indefinite advancemenr, engaged in a road of experience and discipline,
which points him forward to his end. He has dispositions that render a state of amity, with his fellow-creatures, agreeable; a state of enmity and malice, unhappy: With a pungent sense of his defecAs, where they serve to debate him; with an agreeable sense of every valuable attainment, in the feelings of a good conicience 
PART I. £cience and self approbation. He is thus urged, by experience,

to advance in the line of his improvement: And therefore, not%vvy ' withstanding the defeds which may yet remain in any particular 
period of his progress, he is to be confidered not as a blemifih, but as a beauty in the order of nature; or, in the scale of being, an approach to the highest excellence of which created nature is susceptible.

In this progressive state of man, much is gained in the fleps 
which are made from the cradle to the grave; and progression ever supposes that what is gained in any fucceflive period, was wanting in a former. The just notions of things, the candour, refolution, and force of mind, which are gained in manhood and age,
were wanting in youth or childhood. Infancy, nevertheless,
hath its merit, as the blossom of youth; and the whole is to be estimated, not from the simultaneous attainment of any particular point of time, but from the collected asped of a nature that is formed to advance and to perfect itself. We anticipate, in the seedling oak and the pine, the future ornaments of the wood;
and estimate the germ of any plant, not by the feed leaf alone,
but by the form it is defrined to gain in the maturity of its fpecies,

WVhat is created can never equal its creator, and in the highest 
is therefore imperfect. With refped to such beings, the least defec is the greatest perfection. A defect which is always diminishing, or in a regular course of supply, we may suppose to be the perfection of created nature. No fixed or definite measure can equal it; for, in the courie of its progress, it muit indefinitely surpass every finite excellence that is fixed or itationary. In its continual approach to the infinite perfection of what is eternal,

3 it 
it may be compared to that curve, described by geometers, as PART I.
in continual approach to a straight line, which it never can reach. 

SEcT.XVI.

In a progress begun with this indefinite prolpec, successive 
periods, even those of. the greatest advancement, may be marked with their refpecive defects and imperfedions. The intelligent being, at his outset, though qualified to obtain knowledge, not only must begin in ignorance; but, while he continues to learn, is till short of omniscience, and may be exposed to error. At any stage of his progress, false notions of good may lead him to vice, to competition with his fellow-creatures, to animosity, strife, and malice; but those, in the sufferings they constitute, carry the feeds of corredion along with them. And the greatest reprobate, when awaked from his dream of iniquity, may be surprised that he could have erred so long or so much. Nor muff it be said, that in this progress of intelligent being, of which man is an example, the happiness of a present time is facrificedl to the attainments which are to be made in a following one. Infancy hath its gratifications no less than youth, and this no less than manhood, or the happieft composure of temper in the last attainments of age.

It is not by any means necessary, that men should forego the 
happiness of their present slate, in order to obtain that of a future one; nor are ordinary men (provided envy, malice, orjealoufy,
do not prevail in their tempers), bereft of enjoyment, even in the midst of the evils of which they complain.

The happiness of man, when most distinguished, is not proportioned to his external poffeflions, but to the exertion and application of his faculti2s: It is not proportioned to his exemption from difficulty or danger, but to the magnanimity, courage,
and fortitude, with which he ads. It is not proportioned to the 
VOL. I. A a benefits 
PARr I. benefits he receives, but to those he bestows, or rather to the SCAP.XVI. candour and benevolence with which, as a person obliging or 
woku obliged, he is ready to embrace his fellow-creatures, and to acknowledge or reward their merits. Even while he complains of his lot he is not unhappy. His complaints are no more than the symptom of a mind that is engaged in fbme pursuit by which his wishes are engrossed, but of which the end is still unobtained.
In the absence of such occupations and troubles, as are prescribed by neceflity, he devises, for the most part, a similar course of occupation, trouble, difficulty, and danger, for himself.

The rich and the powerful, (fay the vulgar) are happy, for they 
are exempted fromlabour and care: Their pleasures come unsought for, and without any allay of pain. But what are the high objeds of ambition to which the wealthy and the powerful aspire ? Are they not often Situations of great trouble and danger, in continual application to arduous affairs of state, or in frequent expofure to the dangers of war ? What do the idle devise to fill up the blank of real affairs ? Not a bed of repose, nor a fucceflion of inert and slothful enjoyments: They devise sports that engage them in labour and toil, not less revere than that of the indigent who works for his bread; and expose them to dangers not less real, than those which occur in what are thought the most hazardous pursuits of human life.

In the intermission of business, and in the absence of danger,

what has the secure and the idle, under the denomination of play, devised for his own recreation ? A course of serious and intense application, a itate of suspense between good and ill fortune, between profit and loss. While he itrenuoufly labours to obtain the one and to avoid the other, he calls the one a good,

and 
and the other an evil: but he himself has voluntarily incurred PART I.
this chance of good or of evil. He exults in gain, and he laments 



his loss; but he still freely embraces the chance by which he is exposed to one or the other. The game, such as it is, he confiders as a fit pastime for himself; and though he complains of his fortune when unsuccessful, he is never so unreasonable, as to arraign the inventor of the game for having admitted the poffibility of ill as well as good fortune.

The passion for play is comparatively mean and unworthy;

but the illustration it brings to the condition of man is apposite,
and will justify the terms in which we conclude, that, in the game of human life, the inventor knew well how to accommodate the players.

If man be a worthy ador in this order of things, the scene is 
prepared for the part it behoves him to aat: And from his .cafe, as well as from the general aspea of things, we may venture to conclude with Epidetus, that to those who are quaJified with intelligence and a grateful mind, every circumitance or event in the order of nature may serve to manifest, and to extol the supreme wisdom and goodness of God.




C H A P. III.
OF MAN'S PROGRESSIVE NATURE.

S E C T IO N I.
Of the DJtinaion of Natures, Progrefive and Stationary, and its 
immediate application to the Subjets of Science.

THERE is in nature a well known dillinEtion of things pro- PART I.
greflive, and stationary, to which we must attend in the farthcr SECT. 1.
purfiit of our fubjeat.

To 
PART I. To be flationary, it is not necessary that a fubjedt lhould -be 
incapable of change, even from the action of any external cause:

w'Vx It is sufficient that it have not any principle of change in its own 
nature. To be progressive, on the contrary, does not consist in any variation or change which an external fcaufe may produce;
but in those transitions, from one state to another, which proceed from a principle of advancement in the fubje& itself.

A block of stone, from the quarry, may receive, in the hands 
of a workman, any variety of forms, blutleft to itself, would remain in its slate.

A seedling plant, on the contrary, in a favourable foil and ex,
pofure, takes root and grows of itself.

Progressive natures are subjed to vicissitudes of advancement 
or decline, but are not stationary, perhaps, in any period of their existence. Thus, in the material world, subjects organized,
being progressive, when they cease to advance, begin to decline,
however insensibly, at the time of their transition from one to the other. In this consist the operation or failure of vegetable and animal life. In their advancement, the matter of which they are composed accumulates, and at every period acquires a form that approaches to the end of their progress. The principle of life itself gains strength or ability to discharge, and to vary the functions of nature. In their decline they fade, shrink,
and abate of their vigour and force.

Intelligence appears to be, in a still higher degree, a principle 
of progression, and fubjeca to greater extremes of comparative advancement or degradation. It is advanced by continual acccf3 fionc 
sions of observation and knowledge; of skill and habit, in the PART I.

resolute purpose or power. It declines through defed of memo- v ry, discernment, afferion, and resolution.

While fubjets flationary are described by the enumeration of 
co-existent parts, and quiescent qualities, subjeCts progreflive are charadterifed by the enumeration of steps, in the passage from one form or state of existence to another, and by the termination or point of approach, whether near or remote, to which the fucceflive movements of their nature are direted.

The rank of a progressive subjed is to be estimated, not by its 
condition at any particular ltage of its progress, but by its capacity and destination to advance in the scale of being. From the feeblest shoot or ieed-leaf of the oak, though more diminutive than many plants of the garden, we already forecast the flately fabric it is designed to raise in the forest. In the human infant,
though inferior to the young of many other animals, we anticipate the beauty of youth, the vigorous foul of manhood, and the wisdom of age. And the highest rank, in the scale of created existence, is due to that nature, if such there be, which is deftined to grow in perfection, and may grow without end: its good is advancement, and its evil, decline.

We are inclined to confider progression as made up of ftationary periods; as we confider a circle as a polygon of an infinite number of fides; a fluid as made up of solid parts indefinitely finall.;
and duration itself, as made up of.fucceflive points, or indivisible moments of time.

far 
PART I. In this ourconception is inaccurate, and our reasoning, of course,
CHaP.III.
SECr. I. likely to become incorre&. Progression may, no doubt, be divided 
into periods; but in no period, perhaps, is the subjet Rtationary.
Every subdivision, like the whole of its progress, is a transition from one slate to another, and through states intermediate, more or less numerous according to the divisions under which we are pleased to conceive them. The progress of intelligent being, for initance,
may be more or less rapid, but is continual; and in the very continuance of existence, and the repetition of consciousness and perception, mufi receive continual increments of knowledge and thought. Or in the failure of the Iource from which it derives improvement, is likely to incur degradation and decline.

For our purpose, however, it is sufficient to observe, that the 
state of nature or the diftindive character of any progreflive being is to be taken, not from its description at the outset, or at any subsequent Rtage of its progress; but from an accumulative view of its movement throughout. The oak is diflinguifhable from the pine, not merely by its feed leaf; but by every fucceffive aspea of its form; by its foliage in every successive season;
by its acorn; by its spreading top ; by its lofty growth, and the length of its period. And the state of nature, relative to every tree in the wood, includes all the varieties of form or dimension through which it is known to pass in the course of its nature.

By parityof reason, the natural slate of a living creature includes 
all its known variations, from the embryo and the foetus to the breathing animal, the adolescent and the adult, through which life in all its varieties is known to pass.

J The 
The itate of nature, relative to man, is also a Rtate of progref- PART I.
Lion equally real, and of greater extent. The individual receives 

SECT. 1.

the .irft tfamina of his frame in a growing Rtate. His stature is Y
waxing, his limbs and his organs gain strength, and he himself a growing facility in the use of them. His faculties improve by exercise, and are in a continual Rfate of exertion.

If his thoughts pass from one subjed to another, he can return 
to the subjec he has left, with some acquired advantage of difcernment or comprehension. He accumulates perceptions and observations, takes cognizance of new fubjeds, without forgeting the old; knows more, of course, at every subsequent period than he did in a former; reasons more securely; penetrates obscurities, which at firRf embarrassed him; and performs every operation of thought with more facility and more success.

With refpeA to the period of his existence he fees it but in 
part. When he. looks back to the point from which he let out,
he cannot descry it; when he looks forward to the end of his line, he cannot foresee it. He may observe the birth and the death of a fellow creature, but knows nothing of his own. If he were to assume the earliest date he remembers as the beginning of his existence, he might loon be convinced that he overlooked a considerable period which had preceded; or if he flhould suppose his being to end with the diifolution of his animal frame,
it is poflible he might be equally mistaken. Yet he finds nothing in the world around him beyond the limits of what he can collec from the remembrance of the past, or infer by sagacity from the laws of nature in foresight of the future, from which he can fix any certain marks of his own beginning or his end.

VOL. I. B b Such,

PART I. Such, without entering into the peculiarities or unequal deCHiAP.III.
grees of power incident to different men, we may afiume as the 
r^v fctate of nature relative to the individual.

The Rtate of nature relative to the species is differently confiituted, and of different extent. It consists in the continual fucceslion of one generation to another; in progressive attainments made by different ages; communicated with additions from age to age;
and in periods, the farthest advanced, not appearing to have arrived at any necessary limit. This progress indeed is subjed to interruption, and may come to a close, or give way to viciflitude at any of its ltages; but not more necessarily at the period of highest attainment than at any other.

So long as the son continues to be taught what the father knew,

or the pupil begins where the tutor has ended, and is equally bent on advancement; to every generation the state of arts and accommodations already in use serves but as ground work for new invention and successive improvement. As Newton did not acquiefce in what was observed by Kepler and Galileo; no more have successive astronomers reftrirted their view to what Newton has demonstrated. And with refped to the mechanic and commercial arts, even in the midst of the molt laboured accommodations, so long as there is any room for improvement, invention is busy as if nothing had yet been done to supply the necessities, or complete the conveniencies of human life: But even here, and in all its fleps of progreflion, this active nature, in refpe& to the advantages, whether of knowledge or art, derived from others,
if there be not a certain effort to advance, is exposed to reverse and decline. The generation, in which there is no desire to know more or pradife better than its predecessors, will pro2z~~~~~~ ~~~bably 
bably neither know so much nor prae2ife so well. And the de- PART 1.
dine of successive generations, under this wain of intellectual a- CHAP-.1.
bility, is not less certain than the progress made under the operation of a more acive and forward disposition.

Such is the slate of nature relative to the human species; and,

in this, as in every other progressive fubjedt, the present being intermediate to the past and the future, may be different from either: Each is a part of the whole; and neither can, with any reason, be said to be more natural than the others. It cannot be said, that it is more natural for the oak to spring from its feed than to overshadow the plain; that it is more natural for water to gufli from the land in springs than to flow in rivers, and to mix with the sea.

The Rfate of nature relative to man, however, is sometimes a 
mere term of abftradion, in which he is stated apart from the society he forms, from the art he invents, the science he acquires,
or the political establishment he makes: And, when his progress in any of there refpeas is to be confidered, it is no doubt convenient to confider the particular in queition apart from himself,
and from every thing else. It is not, however, to be supposed,
that man ever existed apart from the qualities and operations of his own nature, or that any one operation and quality existed without the others. The whole, indeed, is conneced together,
and any part may vary in measure or degree, while in its nature and kind it is Rill the fame.

The child may be confidered apart from his parent, and the 
parent apart from his child; but the latter would not have existed without the former. If we trace human society back to this 

PART I. its fimplefi constitution, even there the society was real: If we trace CIxp r 'l hullan tlhought back to its flmpleft exertions, even there it was 
k/'.. an exercise of understanding, and' some effort of invention or skil'l.

The groups in which the rudest of men were placed, had their 
thiefs and their members; and nothing that the human species ever attained, in the latest period of its progreSs, was altogether without a germ or principle from which it is derived, in the earliest or most antient itate of mankind.

It may no doubt be convenient, we may again' repeat; in fpecutation, or in assigning the origin and in deriving the progress of any attainment, to confider the attainment itself abftra&ly, or apart fi-om the faculty or power by which it is made;
and, we must not deny ourselves the use of such abftradcions, in treating of' human nature, any more than in treating of any other subject. But there is a caution to be observed in the use of abftraaions, relating to any subjec whatever: That they be not iniflaken for realities, nor obtruded for historical faAs.

The language of geometry is necessarily abftraac'. A point is 
mere place, confidered apart from any dimension whatever. A
line is length, confidered apart from. breadth or thickness. A
surface is length and breadth^ confidered apart from thickness.
And, in a solid, a-ll the dimensions of length, breadth, and thickncfs, are admitted. But the geometrical abflractions are no where mistaken for realities: Length is not supposed to exist with.out breadth, nor length and breadth without thickness. Or,
if luch mitfakes are adually made, yet, no one would infer that lines are more natural than surfaces, or: furfccs more natural than iblidls.

Suc.l 
Such miflake and misapprehension of terms is scarcely admit- P'n.IT

C,-AAP.A1L..

ted, except in treating of human nature. In every other pro- S cT. 1.
greffive subjeCt, progression itself, not any particular ftep in the w progress, is supposed to constitute the natural fRate. The last lhoot of the oak, after it has stood five hundred years in the soreft, and carried a thousand branches,. is not deemed less natural than the first.

Under this term, of the State of Nature, authors assea to looL

back to the first ages of man, not without some apparent design to depreciate his nature, by placing his origin in some unfavourable point of view; as we derogate, from the filppofed honours of a family, by looking back to the mechanics or peasants, from whom its ancestors were descended.

Hobbes contended, that men were originally in a state of war,

and undifpofed to amity or peace; that society, altogether unnatural to its members, is to be established and preserved by force.
Or this, at leafi, may be supposed to follow from his general afslmption that the tfate of nature was a itate of war.

If this point muff be seriously argued, we may ask in what 
sense war is the state of nature? Not surely the only Rfate of which men arc susceptible; for we find them at peace as well as at war: Nor can we suppose it the state which mankind ought at all times to prefer; for it labours under many inconveniences and defects: But it was, we may be told, the first ant the carlieft slate, from which men were relieved by convention and advcntitious eftablifliments.

PART P. This assertion, that war was the earliest state of mankind, is CHAP.II.
made without proof; for the firt ages of the human species, in 
V^ vj times patl, are as little known as the last, that may close the scene 
of its being in times to come. In every progression, it is true, may be conceived, a point of origin, and a point of termination, to be collected from the direcion in which the progress proceeds. The fun, even by a person who never saw him rife or set, may be supposed, from the course he holds, to have risen in the east, and to £et in the weft. Man, who is advancing in knowledge and art,
may be supposed to have begun in ignorance or rudeness; but it is not neceltary to suppose that a species, of whom the individuals are sometimes at war, and sometimes at peace, mufl have begun in war. There is, on the contrary, much reason to suppose, that they began in peace, and continued in peace, until fobie occasion of quarrel arose between them.

The progress of the species, in population and numbers, implies an original peace, at least, between the sexes, and between the parent and his child, in family together ; and, if we are to luppofe a state of war between brothers, this, at least, muit have been posterior to the peace in which they were born and brought up, to the peace in which they arrived at the poifefllon of those talents, and that force, which they come to employ for mutual deftrution.

Another philosopher, in this school of nature, has chofcn to 
fix the original description of man, in a state of brutality, unconfcious of himself, and ignorant of his kind; so far from being destined to the use of reason, that all the attempts he has made,
at the exercise of this dangerous faculty, has opened but one continual source of depravation and misery.

But,

But, as the former of these philosophers has not told us what PART I.



beneficent power, different from man himself, has made. peace SFCT. 1.
for this refractory being; no more has the other informed us, v-r'J
who invented reason for man; whose thoughts and reflections first disturbed the tranquillity of his brutal nature, and brought this vicim of care into this anxious slate of reflection, to which are imputed so many of his follies and sufferings.

Until we are told by whom the slate of nature was done away,

and a new one substituted, we muff continue to suppose that this is the work of man himself; and the whole of what there shrewd philosophers have taught, amounts to no more than this, that man would be found in a slate of war, or in a ifate of brutality,
if it were not for himself, for his own qualifications, and his endeavours to obtain a better; and that, in reality, the situation he gains is the effect of a faculty by which he is disposed to chufe for himself.

This we arc ready to admit. Man is made for society and the 
attainments of reason. If, by any conjuncture, he is deprived of these advantages, he will sooner or later find his way to them.
If he came from a beginning, defective in these refpeds, he was,
from the firfl, disposed to supply his defects; in process of time has actually done so, continued to improve uponevery advantage he gains: And thus to advance, we may again repeat, is the slate of nature relative to him.

It were absurd, to think of depreciating a progreflive being,

by pointing out the slate of defedc, from which he has pasTed, to the attainment of a better and a higher condition; for so to pass is the specific excellence of his nature.

The 
PART I. Tle grandeur of the forest is not the less real, for its having CHAP.II.
prung up from among the weeds of the field: The genius of 
wy-r Newton, not the less to be admired, for his having grown up 
from the ignorance and simplicity of his infant years: Nor the policy of Athens, Sparta, or Rome, less to be valued, because they may have sprung from hordes, no way superior to those, who are now found in different parts of Africa or America.

It is the nature of progrefflon to have an origin, far short of the 
attainments which it is direced to make ; and not any precise meafire of attainment, but the passage or transition from defect to perfedion is that which constitutes the felicity of a progressive nature.
The happy being, accordingly, whose deftinationis to better himself,
must not confider the defed under which he labours, at the outset, or in any subsequent part of his progress, as a limit set to his ambition, but as an occasion and a spur to his efforts.

The life and acivity of intelligent being consists in the confcioufnefs or perception of an improveable state, and in the effort to operate upon it for the better. This constitutes an unremitting principle of ambition in human nature. Men have different objeAs, and succeed unequally in the pursuit of them: But every person, in one sense or another, is earnest to better himself.

Man is by nature an artist, endowed with ingenuity, discernmnent, and will. These faculties he is qualified to employ on different materials; but is chiefly concerned to employ them on himself: Over this fubjedc his power is most immediate and most complete; as he may know the law, according to which his progrefs is effeted, by conforming himself to it, he may, haften or Sccurc the result.

The 
The bulk of mankind are, like other parts of the system, sub- PART I.



jeded to the law of their nature, and, without knowing it, are led SECT. 1.
to accomplish its purpose: While they intend no more than sub- Yv.
fiftence and accommodation, or the peace of society, and the safety of their persons and their property, their faculties are brought into use, and they profit by exercise. In mutually condueting their relative interests and concerns, they acquire the habits of political life; are made to taste of their highest enjoyments, in the affections of benevolence, integrity, and elevationl of mind; and, before they have deliberately confidered in, what the merit or felicity of their own nature consist, have already learned to perform many of its noblest functions.

Nature in this as in many other instances does not entrust the:

conduct of her works to the precarious views and designs. of any subordinate agent. But if the progress of man in every instance were matter of neceflity or even of contingency, and no way dependent on his will, nor fubjeced to his command, we should conclude that this sovereign rank and responsibility of a moral agent with which he is vested, were given in vain; and the capacity of erecting a fabric of art, on the foundation of the laws of nature, were denied to him in that department precisely in which they are of the highest account. If he may work on the clay that is placed under his foot, and form it into models of grace and beauty; if he. may employ the powers of gravitation,
elasticity, and magnetism, as the miniflers of his pleasure; we.
may suppose, also, that the knowledge of laws operating on himself should dire& him how to proceed, and enable him to haften the advantages,to which his progressive nature is competent. If 
VOL. I. Cc his 
PART I. his Maker have destined his faculties to improve by exercise, and by the attainment of habits, there is no doubt that he himself -vr-v, maychufe what exercise he will perform, and what habits he Ihall 
acquire.

But in order to profit by the laws of progression which take 
place in his frame, it behoves him to recollet what they are,
and to take his resolution refpeding the purpose to which he will apply their force.

To this objet, he is urged at once by the double confideration of a good to be obtained, and of an evil to be avoided.
Moit fubjeds in nature, which, from the energy of a salutary principle, are susceptible of advancement, are likewise, by the failure or abuse of that principle, susceptible of degradation and ruin. Plants and animals Care known to perish, in the fame gradual manner in which they advance into strength and beauty.
Man, with whom the sources of good and of evil are more entrusted to his own management, is likewise exposed, in a much higher degree, to the extremes of comparative degradation and misery. The progress of nations in one age, to high measures of intellecual attainment and cultivated manners, is not more remarkable than the decline that Sometimes ensues in their fall to extreme depravation and intellectual debility.

It may not be in the power of the individual greatly to promote the advancement or to retard the decline of his country.
But every person, being principally interested in himself, is the absolute mailer of his own will, and for the choice he liall have made is alone responsible.

We 
We ihall proceed therefore under this title to state the princi- PART I.
ples of progression in the nature of man, and the laws of which CHAP.IIL


every one may avail himself in chufing the direction he ihould 'v follow, and the attainment he should make.


Of the Trinciples of Progre.fon in Human Nature.

PA.T II. AMONG the principles of progrefion in human nature, may  be reckoned, first of all, what is common to man with other 
-'~^v ' beings endowed with life; the vegetating and animal powers,

by which the organized body waxes in itature and in strength.

These powers are known to us only by their effects, operating 
in the midst of organs and combinations of matter, fubje& to waste, and requiring supply. The living forms are in a continual slate of fluCtuation and change. The supply of one period exceeding the waite, and that of another period falling fliort of it, they advance and recede. They are, at the fame time, expofed to disturbance and interruption from external causes; and affteded in their course by inequalities of health or disease:
But the powers of life, with which they' are endowed in the mofi uninterrupted poffeflion of health, wear out; or incur a decline and a final extintion.

Thus 
Thus the principle of life, by which organized matter for a PART I.

.

While is animated, itself ceases to aad-; and the materials on which 
it operated depart from their organization, and become inert. /'Y

With these are conneced, in the human frame, a power of intelligence, conscious of itself, and of its gradual enlargement.
This important circumstance is not otherwise known than as a fad, or as ;the particula' phenomenon of a general law, common to all living and a&ive natures: That a faculty, or organ, which is properly exerted, gets accession offlrength or mafi, whit/ that which is faerfetrained, or iteglesed, goes to decay.

The improvement of human faculties, therefore, is likely to 
depend on the propriety of their exercises ; and the progress of the species itself wll, without their intending it, keep pace with the ordinary -prf&its, in Which successive .generations are engaged.

Under the general :title of exercises, may be enumerated the 
Siarious pursuits, into which mankind are led by the wants and 'necessities they have to tipply, the inconveniences they have to remove, or the advantages which are placed in their view; as the ipur which nature applies to excite and to direc their exertions.

The pursuits of human life, are, in part, occasioned by the 
exigencies of mere animnal nature, and have for object the supplies of necessity, accommodation, or pklafr1ure.

The supply which is provided for any, or all of these purposes,

1~~~~~~~~I ~~conifis 
-PART I. consists of many separate articles, which, variously distributed in  the form of property, render commerce and exchange a mutual 
,.v-/' conveniency to the parties concerned, a consequence which may 
justify our distinguishing the expedients which are employed in procuring or disposing of these articles, under the general title of commercial arts.

The adive pursuits of man result also from the exigencies of 
human society, or its need of establishments, to restrain diforders, and to procure the benefits of which it is susceptible.

The provisions required for the safety and better government of men in society, may be termed the political arts.

Men are also engaged in the pursuits of knowledge, and in 
multiplying intellectual attainments; no less an exigency of the mind, than the means of subsistence and accommodation, are an exigency of mere animal life.

To penetrate the order established in nature; to emulate this 
order in works of design and invention; to unfold the principles of estimation, and realize the conceptions of excellence and beauty, in works to be executed by human art, or in the characer and mind of the artist himself, is the peculiar province of man;
and in his condut, with refped to it, gives occasion to the most improving exertion of his faculties.

These exercises of intelligence, whether found in pursuits of 
knowledge, of elegant design, or moral improvement, may be stated under their refpedtive titles, of investigation and theory,
of fine arts, and moral philosophy.

To 
To the end for which any, or all of these arts are pracifed, PART I.



the principle of ambition applies itself. This is defined in our 
dictionary, the desire of something better than is possieed at present, 'v and prevents acquiescence in any precise measure of attainment already made. In the pursuits of wealth, it is the desire of more property than is possessed at present: In civilization, it is the defire of establishments more complete, and more effecual for the peace and good order of society: In the pursuits of science, it is the desire of more knowledge: In the fine arts, it is the desire of more finished produAions: And in philosophy, it is the desire of schemes more correat and accomplished, applicable to the character, acion, and institutions of men.

In each of these pursuits, or applications of mind, we may 
farther remark, that the operation does not pass away in mere transient exertion; or, like the shadow of a cloud on the plain,
leaves not a track behind. Continued practice is producive of habit, or facility of doing again what has been done; some acquired inclination, and some acceflion of power, which serve to give the mind a possession of the inclination or will it has for any time entertained, and of the faculty it has brought into use.

Habit is the well known effec of continuance in any employment or course of life. Like every other law, which may be said to itand prominent on the surface of nature, it is familiar to every one; and, like the laws of gravitation and motion, is made the most ordinary foundation of method, in whatsoever we do:
Hence, we go to learn a calling, by continued endeavours to attain it; and repeat a performance, at which we arc at first 


PART I aukward, in order to become more dextrous or expert in the practice of it.

Such then, in general, we may confider as. the principles: of 
progrefflon in the human mind; but the law. of nature,. as it operates in each, yet merits a more ample discussion. That of ambition and habit, in particular, though the las, in this enumeration, may very properly have the firit place; as they enter into the consideration of every pursuit and attainment, of which they are the fruit or the incitement, the active engagements- f men being prompted by ambition, and, in fa&, to be effimated very much by the habits they furnish and leave behind.

Habit is known to be that, by which the good or bad adcions 
of men remain with them, and become part of their charavers.
But how far a person may avail himfelfof this law, in chaooing not only what he ihall do at any particular time, but also what lie shall at all times be inclined to do, has, not, perhaps, been sufficiently tried; and: the importance of the question- may jutify a detail of the subjed, however little recommended by navelty, or entitled to the praise of discovery: It is indeed dwelt upon here, not as a matter new to the observation of any one, but as a matter which ought to be attended to, as much as it is known.

Of Habit in general.

HABIT is a source of inclination, but is not numbered among PART I.
the original propensities of human nature; because it is not that by 



which we are at firit inclined to ad, but a disposition which re- /
fults from our having already acied. It is the acquired relation .of a person to the state in which he has repeatedly been; as the relation of a tradesman to his calling; of a ftatefinan to the dctail of affairs ; or of a warrior to the operations of war: In all of which the adept is diftinguifled from the novice, by a difference of inclination or choice, by superior fiill, power, and facility of performance.

VOL. I. D d The 
PART I. The sac is familiar, and may be atfumed as a law of nature CaAP.III.
E C,. II1. common to men, and to animals of every description, That what·'rYe' ever the living nature is able to perform without impairing its organs,

if per2fited in, will produce a habit. In this habit, as mankind experience it, there is implied sometimes a gradual diminution of pain, which accompanies first attempts; a promptitude, gradually acquired, in Surmounting difficulties ; accessions of power and strength, in producing effets; and a propensity or disposition,
even without reflection or design, to be doing that to which the person aCding has been Sometimes accuitomed.

In fubjeds of desirable attainment, habit is matter of felicity 
and commendation. In matters idle or unnecessary, it is reckoned a misfortune or a blemish.

There is foinewhat analogous to this law of nature in the vegetable and mechanical kingdoms, as well as in the animal or in the rational. The twig that is turned from its position, and forced away from the natural direction of its growth, will continue to vegetate in its new diretion, or will come round and become bent, in order to recover at every shoot the natural direction from which it was diverted. Even bodies deetitute of organization, have an elastic power, by which they recover from any change that has been made in their figure, or in the relative pofition of their parts. As soon as the external prefflure is withdrawn,
they suddenly revert to their ordinary state; but, under the effecs of violence continued for any time, they are observed to become in a manner less relucant to a slate into which at first they were forced; and in which, if retained during the time that is neceffary for this effec, they become quiescent, adopt a new figure,

~~2.~~~~~~ ~~and 
and exert their elastic power, as before, in preserving or recover- PART [.
ing the state they had acquired. Thus the bow, that has been CHAP.LT

' .

.too long bent, at first becomes weak, or if kept so long in that Cr'-e position as to acquire a new shape, its elasticity operates in retaining a curvature contrary to that which it originally had.
And it may be figuratively said to have acquired a new habit.

An animal will move spontaneously, not only in the track to 
which he has an original propensity or inftindive direction, but also in any track into which he has been forced,provided he has been made to move in it, during the period of tine which is necellal-y for that purpose.

The period required to the acquisition of a habit may be unequal in the cafe of different animals, and in the different performances to which it may be propostd to train them.

In the cafe of man, when he is willing to acquire a habit, his 
acquisition will be aided by his knowledge of the purpose, and by his inclination to obtain it: But, where he is laid under conftraint, and fubjeded to a tafli without any concurrence of his own will, he is likely to be more restive and tardy in his progrefs than any other species of animal whatever: His aversion to constraint augments his dislike to the purpose for which it is applied, and he is ingenious to thwart the design; the labour of his inftru&or or matter is doubled, first, to overcome his repugnance, and next to continue the practice, until it has produced the ordinary effect of reconciling the practitioner to what he may at first have disliked.

With respect to man, however, though difiiofed to be his own 
D d 2 maiter 
PART I. mafler, and unwilling to move in any trammels prescribed to  him, the effeet of continuance, even when forced, much more .

.-rv xJ when it is voluntary, is extremely conspicuous : It is that which 
brings him to conceive objeds in the form under which they have been repeatedly presented to him : It is that which gives hiill a power or facility in performing what he has been repeatedly made to perform; which renders that pleasant which was formerly painful, and gives him an inclination to be doing what he has repeatedly done.

S E C T IO N IV.

Of Habits of Thinking.

AS the conception entertained in the present time is, to every PART I.
person while he continues to entertain it, the standard of truth CHAP'.II



and reality; it were difficult to persuade him, that his present convidion, in any infiance, is the mere effec6 of continued reprefentations, whether made to him in the ordinary course of things,
in accidental coincidences, or in the received opinions and notions of other men.

This subjeA has been touched in a former feRion, though 
without any inclination to scepticism, or doubt of the conceptions which are attended with the genuine evidence of truth.

Nature, in providing the means of information, has warranted for truth and reality whatever she uniformly or generally presents in the order of her works: But what we raflily infer from singular initances, or what is obtruded in vulgar opinions,
may be ill-grounded and false; and yet men, in being repeatedly 
PART I. ly made to conceive an object in the fame way, come to mistake  their own habit of conception for an evidence of truth. Whence SecT. IV.

_r\^ is it else, that the fubjeas of monarchy have one opinion refpe'ing the expedience of political eftablifllments, and the members of democracy a different one ? VWhence is it that the creed of the vulgar is fb different in Asia, from what it is in Europe?

There are topics, no doubt, from which the enquiring mind 
may derive evidence of truth in these matters ; but to these topics the vulgar seldom resort, and are generally the more bigotted to their tenets, the less they recur to the grounds on which they reft.
The habit of unquestioned belief is, in fad, more powerful than evidence, to make the implicit believer not only reject any new information, but meet the attempt to convince himn with liUr-.
prise and detestation.

There are habits of thinking peculiar to nations, to different ages, and even to individuals of the fame nation and age, taken up at first without evidence, and often tenaciously retained without being questioned. In Greece, it was thought dishonourable to lose the shield in battle, or turn the back upon an enemy: In Scythia, flight was thought an ordinary stratagem in war. In Greece, music and dancing were reckoned accomplishments: At Rome they were reckoned disgraceful. Our ancestors conceived the military character, as that which difinguiflhed the lord or the gentleman: In their opinion, to be noble and military was the fame. Ask a gentleman of the continent of Europe what it is to be noble ? He will anfver, it is to be descended through a certain number of generations of noble ancestors.

man. Ask him to discuss the evidence of these opinions: He will . -,
rejea the proposal with contempt. The citizen, in a democratical government, on the contrary, cannot conceive how a man that is born free should be inferior to another, who does not excel him in parts, integrity, or in service performed to his country.

The authority of government itself, under every political eftablifiment, refts on the habits of thinking, which prevail among the people. In monarchy, .the subjet has a refpedful conception of royalty; and every one in his place has refpea for the rank that is immediately over him: In ariftocratical government, this refped is by the many, entertained for a few: And in republics, which admit every order of the people to some share in the government of their country, the object 'of refpec is conceived in the slate itself, and in the law by which it is governed. Sovereignty, in all these instances, is entrusted with force: and the arms of the community are wielded by some species of executive power that may be obliged, on occasion, to employ them againit the disorderly. Even violence is effectual to support the authority of government, so long as the bulk of the people agree in opinion with their rulers, and think that the force of the state is properly applied: But, when the body of the people are of a different opinion, or conceive the use of force to be an ad of injustice, they themselves being conscious of a superior force, are not over-awed, but rather exasperated, by its application, and made to unite in their own defence.

In ordinary times, the pretensions of sovereignty arc received 
wi th 
PART I. with implicit faith. UnneceiTary applications, whether of force,
or even of argument, in support of those pretensions, do but endanger the shaking of a habit of thinking, which might otherwise remain unmoved,

If force is to be employed against the sense of a majority, this 
majority too, has force; which, when brought to the trial, must be found the greatest, or, if reason is to be consulted, the reason of the majority, under the influence of any opinion, is always on their own fide. James I. of England would never cease convincing his fubjedts, that he had a right to their personal services,
and to their property: but they had, at leaf, begun to think otherwife; and he, by keeping the subjeCt in view, entailed an argument on his posterity, which ended in the downfall of his house.

Erroneous opinions are termed mistakes or prejudices. A miftake may be of any date; but if recent, for the most part, easily gives way to better information. Prejudice implies opinion of a certain standing, or longer duration. The prejudices of childhood are sometimes corrected by the experience of manhood or youth: But otherwise, the longer a notion has remained unqueftioned, the more firm its poffeflfon of the mind. For this reason national prejudices are, of all others, the most firmly retained; they are early inculcated, and remain unqueflioned under the authority of numbers, or of the prevailing opinion, which individuals can seldom refilt.

The diflinCtion of Greek and Barbarian, within the pass of 
Thermopylxe, was an expression of felf-eftimation in the Greek,
and of contempt to the refl of mankind. The Athenians, we are 
,~~~~~~~~~~~~~3 t~told,

told, believed their city to be the centre of Greece, and Greece to PART T.
be the centre of the world. Round these centres, other parts of 



the earth were conceived as no more than firits and appendages. _
A like opinion is said to be exemplified in the geography and self estimation of the Chinese.

Many a Mussulman would be greatly surprised, or receive the 
information with contempt, if they were told, tlat there may be persons, in a nation of Chriflians, no less entitled to consideration,
or no less worthy of esteem than the most renowned of the Faithful.

From Such fads, relating to the effeAs of habit, the principal 
lessons to be taken are; first, refpeaing ourselves, To abate of our confidence in notions long entertained, except in fb far as they are Supported by evidence; and next, To prevent our thinking unfavourably of the understanding or sincerity of those who differ from ourselves in habits of thinking, which they may not have had fulffcient occasion to question; and to remember, that although such habits render men obstinate in mistaken notions of tlings, they also render them steady to the truth, which they may have been To happy as to have once perceived; and that habit prevents the wavering and fluctuation of mind, which might otherwife arise from too easy reception of one opinion or notion of things for another.

It is wifely appointed in the order of nature, that the course 
of events to a certain degree is regular, and that occasions re.
turn at their ordinary periods. In what concerns the mind,
there is a certain stability of thought, no less a part in the order of intelleCtual being. It is secured to the wife, not only by the 
VOL. I. E e permancnce 
PART I. permanence of those appearances on which they reft a well sgrounded assent. It is confirmed, also, by of habit, which gives NrYv to opinion its continued poffeflion of the mind, without always 
recurring to the evidence on which it was originally founded.

In matters of mere discretion, or finall moment, such as are,

for the most part, the ordinary conffituents of good or ill manners; the proprieties of language and dress; the routine of hours for meals, for bufiners, or play; the place of diftinAion in company; or the choice of innocent and arbitrary rites; it is better that the members of society should be of one mind, though perhaps with little foundation of evidence or reason, than that every one should, under pretence of thinking for himself, be at variance with his neighbour in matters of triffling account.

The authority of prevailing opinions makes at least one bond 
of society; and it is more fit that the people lhould move together, though not in the best way that might be devised for them,
than that they should disband and separate into different ways,
where no one might find, in the way he had chosen for himself,
any thing to compensate his separation from the reft of his kind.

The volume of nature is open for the information of mankind. If, in matters of importance, the sagacious are well-informed, they may lead the opinions of others: And it is beneficently provided, that opinions once formed, and continued into habit, should give to human affairs, in every country, and in every age, a certain stability or regularity, to which every person, in the choice of his own conduct, may accommodate himself.

bit, it were absurd to employ any other method, to obtain or pre- _

is preposterous and ineffectual: It tends to give importance to trisfles, to awaken suspicions of a design to tyrannize, and arms the mind with obstinacy or enthusiasm, to retain what was slightly adopted, to rejeA what is violently offered, and what, if the mind were left to itself, would be easily changed for any other apprehenfion of things that is more prevailing or common.

E e 2 SECTION



Of Habit, as it affecs the Inclinations of Men ; and their Capacity of Enjoyment or Suffering.

 IT is a well-known effed of habit, to reconcile men to what was once disagreeable, or to disable them from bearing what was 
once supportable: Thus a manner of life, in refpe& to diet,
accommodation, or dress, to which we are at first repugnant,
may, by use, be rendered agreeable, or even necessary, to our fatisfadion. A person, accuitomed to the life of a mariner,
may become reconciled, and even attached, to the lea. The converse also is true. A person, long disused to what was once agreeable, may lose his relifli for it, and even contradc a dislike to it. A person, long disused to the exercises of the field and the open air, may feel himself diitreffed upon being obliged to go abroad.

It is commonly observed, that some articles, such as fpirituous liquors, and intoxicating drugs, tobacco, or opium, in 
which 
which the vulgar, in different parts of the world, are noft apt PART I.
to debauch, are however, in the first use of them, unpleasant or CHAP. I

V.
harsh to the taste. S V'

We have not any sufficient reason to believe that men, of remote ages and nations, differ from one another otherwise than by habits acquired in a different manner of life: But how differently are they affeced by external causes ? and what a difference do they exhibit in their choice of food, accommodations,
and pleasures ? The train-oil, or putrid fish, which is a feast in Labrador or Kamfchatka, would be little else than poison to an European stomach.

Or if men, in situations so remote from one another, should 
be supposed to be of a different race; or to have incurred, from a difference of climate or situation, a change in the conftrudtion of their organs; varieties, almost equally striking, are obfervable, in the habits contracted in different ranks of life, by men of the fame country and age. The peasant is at ease in his cottage, under a roof, and in the midst of accommodations, that would extremely discontent or displease a person accustomed to other conveniencies.

In such instances, no doubt, men are affected by their habit 
of thinking, no less than by the use of what they are accustomed to enjoy or to bear. In the ranks of society, distinguished by their respeCtive accommodations, the inferior fondly aspires to that which would raise him to the level of his superior. State itself, or the appearance of greatness, is the charm that gives,
to the apparatus of luxury, its principal value. Men, whose fortunes indulge them in the poffeflion of every convenience, and 
in 
PART I. .in the enjoyment of every' pleasure, can nevertheless forego CScLAP. V them with ease, in the hardships of hunting or war; where the x rvrC privation is nor supposed to degrade, or any way to affect their Rfation. Such hardships, incurred in the capacity of a beggar, or supposed to proceed from want of means to live more at their ease,
would occasion extreme distress and dejeCtion of mind. " The " tradesman at Paris," fays the author of the Tableau de Paaris,
" goes forth, on certain holidays, to purchase a fowl for his sup"per; and in this he consults his vanity no less than his palate,
" for he proposes to fare like a gentleman." But such effedts of association in the mind, no less than the effects of a continued use in the bodily organs, are to be ascribed to habit alone.

A talk, which at first is revere and laborious, becomes easy,

and even agreeable, through use. In youth, we are ever bent on pleasure or amusement; and at first averse to the application or restraint of business: But, as there is ever some degree of active exertion, in what we term amusement or pastime, we often slide, by a habit of application, from the one to the other.
The habit of business, when once it is acquired, is from experience, well known to.fupplant the taste for amusement; and to render us indifferent to what, before we had acquired such habit, we confidered as pleasure.

In manhood, what does not engage some serious paflion, and 
has no other recommendation but that of pastime, appears infipid or frivolous; and, when the powers of action have been employed in scenes of difficulty or moment, we cannot stoop to employ them in matters of a less serious, or even less hazardous, nature. The mariner has no enjoyment in the tranquillity of a life on shore ; the warrior is not amused with concerns that do 
not 
not affedt his safety or his honour; the mathematician has no PART IL
delight in problems which are too easily solved; nor the lawyer, CHAP'II
in cafes that do not admit of dispute. S . V

The varieties of sentiment, which men incur through habit,

whether of association or mere pracice and use, are evident in their judgement of manners and actions, no lets than in their feeling of circumstances that assec their own condition. What,
in the manners of one country, is obliging and a favour, in another would be felt as an offence: As death is acceptable to the Superannuated huntsman in the neighbourhood of Hudfon'g Bay, to bestow it is reckoned a favour; and the office devolves on a son or a grandson, who, being supposed to have received the highest obligations, are thus destined to repay it by the last act of piety to his parent.

In the contemplation of there, and such varieties asseting the 
manners of nations, we are apt to enquire, whether any thing be so fixt in the nature of man, as that habit or custom cannot change or remove it ?

It is well known that external expreflions, whether of moral 
sentiment, or devotion, in the manners or religious observances of men, are, like the words of their language, mere arbitrary signs, which custom accordingly may alter: But the sentiments themselves, whether of benevolence towards men, or devotion to God, retain their diftintdive quality under all the variations of external expression. If our question, therefore, refer to qualities of the mind, and the distribution of enjoyment and suffering, from the good or ill qualities of which the mind is susceptible, we may decidedly answer, in the affirmative, that the laws are fixed, and 
1 that 
PART I. that no continuance of ituation, and no repetition of aca, can al.
CHAcP.IL. ter them. Fear and malice, in all the fliapes they assume, wheSECT. V.
k/Vna ther ofjealoufy, envy, or revenge, are ever conflituents offuf..

fering or of misery. Benevolence and fortitude are ever agreeable and confituent of happiness. No continuance of practice can render fear or malice a slate of enjoyment: No habit of thinking can change their effects. Some, through the continued repetition of crimes, may have the confcienceJa,-ed as with a hot iron; and the wicked may have a momentary triumph in the gratification of malice; but no charm can change malice itself,
or fear, into pleasure: Nor does a happy temper of mind pall on the sense, or lose its effect by continued enjoyment.

If habit should produce any change in these important refpecEs,

it must be by fubflituting one affection or temper of the mind for another, candour for malice, and courage for timidity, not by altering the effect while the fame temper remains. Of such changes men no doubt are susceptible ; and it is an object of fupreme concern that they ihould be made for the better, and not for the worse.

Most men are sensible of many a change they have undergone.

in what they inclined to have, or were disposed to do. There is a manner of life, in which they were once aukward, but to which they are now familiar; a tafls to which they were once forced,
but to which they are now reconciled, and to which they proceed by a kind of spontaneous effort, and often without premc.
ditation or intended exertion.

The ordinary progress by which a change of disposition is es2 feled 
'feded, may consist, either in a dihiinution' of the. reluctance PART L.
which we may have originally had, or in a growing facility of .

SECT. V.

repetition which ends in a fort of mechanical tendency of the ac- vo tive powers to renew their exertions, and an alacrity of mind to attempt what is performed with ease and success.

In such inflances, we have yet to observe, and it is of sufficient 
importance to be treated in a separate fedion, that the acquired difposition has the advantage of being attended with a talent or acquired power also. Both taken together are, in some instances termed an art or a calling. The mechanic seems to acquire it in his hands; the orator, in his speech; the student in his quickness of apprehension, in the extent of his views, or in his method of conceivi ng the order of nature; and the wife man, in the possession of a resolute condua, which no first inclination, on his own part, or cafial appearance of things from abroad, can diftrag.

This is probably the noft interesting fact that occurs in the 
history of man. By this law of his nature, he is intrufded to himself, as the clay is intrusted to the hands of the potter; and he may be formed by himself in the course of that life he adopts,
as the vessel is formed by the other, for purposes of honour or d)s honour.

It is not in vain, therefore, that man is endowed with a 
power of discerning what is amiss or defective in the actual state of his own inclinations or faculties. It is not in vain that he is qualified to apprehend a perfecion far beyond his actual attainments. The one is not to him a fruitless topic of regret, nor the other an excitement to vain attempts. The finalVOL. I. F f les

Of the Ejfec7s of Habit in the Acquisition of Strength and Power.

As habit, next to mere will or choice, is the province in which PART I.
man has most ample dominion over himself; and as, in chufing 



what habits he hlall acquire, he is infoe me afure the artificer p./v'
of his own nature, as well as of his own fortune, it is proper to fix the attention Separately upon all the different results of it, notwithstanding that they may have crowded together in every general view of the subjeA. It affecs our opinions and conceptions of things, our enjoyments and sufferings, our inclinations and passions ; and it now merits a separate consideration, in what degree our powers are increased or diminiflied, by virtue of the fame law of our nature.

A.cceflions of power in us are fometimee termed skill, and 
confiO in the knowledge of means that may be employed for the attai;nment of our end: They are also termed a sleight or facility of performance; and are acquired by mere practice, without any increase of knowledge. The first is the result of fciencc;


PART I. the second is the result of habit. And there are few arts or perCHA nIL formances of moment, in which it is not requisite that both rv\ fhlould be united.

A principal diftintion of living and active natures, whether 
merely animal or rational, consists in the increment of substance or of force they receive in the midit of exertions, which, according to the analogy of mechanical attrition ought rather to weaken or destroy the parts in which they are made. Collisions and frifions, which tear and wear a mechanical engine, do but add firength and fubflance to the limbs of an animal in which fimilar flhocks and pressures are fu-flained. Whilst the shoe is worn in treading the ground, the foot that treads without any cover-.
ing, as well as the hand that is employed in hard labour, become callous and. large..

This advantage, by which the animal frame is difinguifhed,

is, no doubt, as we have elsewhere observed, circumscribed within certain bounds. Its exertions may be overfirained; and the esfedt of excess is pernicious, no. less than that of proper exercife is salutary. It is at the fame time to be observed, that a measure of exertion which, if suddenly made., would overstrain and impair the animal. powers, may nevertheless be brought on by fucl. degrees, as may enable a person, in process of time to make it with ease and safety: Insomuch, that he who continues to exert his strength in such efforts as he is able to make, without overstraining his organs, and who goes on to increase his efforts in proportion as his powers increase, may continue his progress far, beyond what could. at fir.t have been expected. It is thus that persons of different callings come to surpass the ordinary firength of men, in the use of such limbs as 
theythey have continual occasion to employ. The porter may be PART r.
knownby the breadth of his shoulders, the seaman by the strength CHiAP.IIt of his arm, and the boxer by the general firmness and protube.- Sve rance of all- his muscles.

In the intellecual nature of man, acquisitions of power are 
made in a similar manner, and no doubt, under similar limitations. The mind may overstrain its faculties; but, without exertion, they are scarcely known to exist; and, it is fiom proper exercise alone, they receive their improvements. Superior genius is observed to languif without its proper employment; and even to inferior degrees of genius, the task which was difficult,.
or. at- first appeared insurmountable, may come, in. the result of habit, to be accompliflied with ease.

By continuing to- attend, to observe, to refiect, and to recolled, we become attentive, observant, penetrating, and comprehenfive, in the treatment of fubjecAs which at first seemed to escape our conception. Whoever can keep possession of his mind and his faculties, in the midst of difficulty or danger, will find his fortitude and: his ability for condua increased by the mere repetition of trying occasions.

In flating the joint progress of inclination and ability in the re-
fult of habit, it merits observation, that, while the mind becomes resolute in the pursuit of its objects, the occasional paflions of hope or fear, of joy or grief, to which that object under its different afpeds gave occasion, appear to subside or lose of their force, even in the circumstances to which they refer. The veteran becomes cool and deliberate in the midst of occasions that try his temper;. he becomes at the fame time far from indiffexcnt,;

PART I. rent, but resolute and able in the conduac of affairs to which he  has been long accustomed: He has an easy recourse to the exvw 'pedients in practice, or to the considerations in persuasion and 
argument, on which he himself has decided the part which he acas.

Thus, the passions abate of their perturbation and tumult, under a continuance of their occasions; while the mind attains to a full possession of its faculties, in discharging the functions, in aid of which the passions may appear at first to have been given,
The novice seemed to require the spurs of hope or joy, the admonitions of fear or grief; but, under the effedts of experience,
there weakeners of the human mind fall off. By the veteran, a steady purpose is formed; and the most effecual measures are taken, even with apparent infenfibilty, to the occasion on which they are required. To this effedt of repeated alarms or emotions in calming the temper, perhaps the philosophical critic alludes,
in placing tragedy, which is composed to move terror and forrow, among the remedies or correcors of there very passions.

Of the Reiflts of Habit in the General Hiflory of the Human 
Species.
IN flating the diftindion of man among the animals, we re- PART I.



marked the indefinite varieties which the human species exhibits, 
in refpea to condition and manner of life. While other animals of a kind or species are uniform, men are greatly diverfified. Uniformity is the character of the one; variety of the other: Insomuch that men, of different ages and nations, exhibit a diversity, almost equivalent to that which takes place in the different kinds of other animals. What two animals in nature are more different in their manner of life, than the Greenlander, alone in his boat, launched upon the stormy sea, in pursuit of the real or other prey by which he subsists; and the wealthy citizen of London or Paris formed to the accommodations which wealth, and the multiplied inventions of art, have procured.

We have observed, that other animals have their rcfpedtive infnincs ; directing them to the element in which they arc fitted 
to 
PART I. to refidee; directing them to the choice of materials, before they  have any experience of the purpose for which they are to be used;

_-Y and, directing them to the use of means before they have view 
to the end: and that, in the form prescribed by nature, they uniformly proceed without any exercise of observation, or latitude of choice. They have their inftincs of ferocity, of timidity, or mildness, as invariable as the shape of their bodies, or the trhucture of their organs.

Man is deitined to observe and to chufe among the objecs around him; to make a trial of different pratices; and to abide by that which is most suited to his circumstances, or to the fituation in which he is placed. Even his own characer, we have observed, takes a stamp from his situation and the manner of life in which he is engaged: He seems to carry in his nature, a principle of dutility or pliancy, which is with-held from the other animals: But, that we may not mistake the effect or the extent of this principle, it is proper to recolleCt, that its existence is inferred from the varieties exhibited by men of different nations,
ages, and ranks of life, not from the facility with which any one individual can turn himself into different fllapes, whether with respeCt to his opinions, his inclinations, or faculties. In refped to these, in every particular instance, there are habits which serve to fix the manners of men, no less than initinA is observed to fix the pracice of other animals.

If this were not the cafe, human life would be a scene of inextricable confusion and uncertainty. One person could not know whether another, in the tranfations of life had any determinate rule of condut ; or whether a party, in any transaction, would abide by the sequel even of what he himnfelf had proposed.

2 Were 
Were intelligent beings so anomalous in their disposition and con- PART I.
duct, the consequence would be no less perplexing,in the rational SECA. IlI.
system, than the want of any uniform law, upon which to proceed,
would be in the practice of mechanical arts; and would equally fruftrate every exertion of prudence or foresight in the conduct of life.

Although man is entrulsed by nature with a superior latitude 
of observation and choice, yet he is not left, upon the return of every occasion, to the mere guidance of an observation he is then to make. The measures, which his experience in former times has led him to employ, recur to his mind on every subsequent occafion of the fame kind; and, even if he flould be off his guard,
or have forgot the grounds of his former proceeding, mere habit will lead him to repeat the fame choice, and to perform the fame acAion. This bias to retain the form he has once adopted, though without any original propensity, is with him nearly of the fame 
,elct with the instincts of other animals.

Were it not for this effect of habit, we fliould have continual 
occasion to complain, that no measures could be taken upon mere expec6ation,nor,any reliance had on a conducAwhich were so f'bjed to flutuation, and without any determinate rule.

Such complaints indeed we have sometimes occasion to make,

but the contrary complaint of obstinacy, in the retention of prejudice and habit, tends to Ihew that man is not left altogether expo£fd to the defects of either extreme: That, while his natural propensitics and acquired habits tend to mark out the line of his conduct, his will is yet free ; and whatever direcLion he may have taken, he is impowered to change it upon the obfiervation of another that is more for his good. As he was qualified at first to 
VOt. 1. G g chufe 
PART I. chute his pracfice, at the hazard of acquiring a habit whether SEcHAPII. proper or improper; so he may judge also of the habit he has acv wY\j 'quired; and, among those he approves or condemns, chufe which 
he would retain, or which he would counteraft and correct by an opposite praAice.

But while we thus glory in the prerogatives of intelligence 
and freedom of choice, we must rejoice also in a circumstance,
which appears to give fixed pofleflion of the attainments we may have made, and which will reward the labours we undergo in forcing any salutary practice, by giving us the ready and fpontaneous use of it when acquired.

The force of habit, it is true, in the ordinary course of human 
life, may fix a disposition to evil no less than to that which is good;
but we may flatter ourselves in the notion, that good, on the whole mufft prevail. It is the tendency of experience to detec every false opinion, and, by this means, to narrow the scope of aberration and mistake. The experience of evil tends for the future to inculcate a better choice; and, by teaching mankind effectually what they ought not to do, limit them at last to what ought to be done, or put them in the train of a wiser or more happy conduct. When every rock or shoal is marked with its beacon, the safe channel or passage alone will remain to be taken by the moif heedless mariner.

Of Ambitiont, or the Deftre of something higher than is possesed at 

DIFFERENT circumstances in the condition of man render PART II



him susceptible of various attainments, or contribute to forward 
his progress; and, on this account, were enumerated among the "Y~'
principles of progression in human nature: But Anbition, in the sense given to it as above, is the specific principle of advancement uniformly direted to this end, and not satiated with any given measure of gratification: It continues to urge its pursuit after the highest attainments are made, no less than it did when farthest removed from its end.

This passion is observed to operate in the concerns of mere animal life; in the provision of subsistence, of accommodation, and ornament; in the progress of society, and in the choice of its infitutions. It operates in the attainments of knowledge, and in every aim at perfedion, whether in executing works of genius,
or in the honourable part which the worthy dcfire to support through life.

G g 2 Personal " Vidt JOIINSON'S DICTIONARY.

PaR' I.I Personal qualities, however, we mutt suppose to be its genuine ScT. Vli. object, as these are-the real conflituents of eminence or true ele\ 'wes vation: And perfetion in the nature of man being never actually attained, will account for the peculiar form of this inflind, which, even where it mistakes its objet, and seems to find a limit beyond which it is vain to urge its pursuits, as in the provision to be made for the accommodation of animal life; yet even in this article, it ever aims at somewhat higher and better than is poieit at present. The miser, after he has got all he can use,
continues to hoard without end what he is determined not to use.

Ambition is, upon this account also peculiar to man. Hie alone, among the animals, seems to conceive the diflindtion of perfetion and defect, and refers to it in many of his mofl vehement ientiments and passions, such as esteem, admiration,
refpe&, veneration, and love, on the one hand; contempt, deteftation, and scorn, on the other.

In refped to whatever objed these sentiments are felt, we may 
prefumc that the diftinAion of excellence and defed is either realized in the objed itself, as it is in the charader and disposition of the human mind; or, if the objecE be in its own nature indifferent, as in compositions of mere matter and form, we may suppose that the notion of perfection or defed is associated with it,
in the mind, and gives occasion to the opposite sentiments of admiration or difguit with which the objec is received or beheld.

There is a real excellence or defed in all the examples of perfonal merit or demerit, in all the examples ofjuftice or injultice,
in the manners or inflitutions ofmen, and in the degrees in 
which 
which minds are poffefled of genius, or defective in point of abi- PAir I.

lity. S.c-.VllI.

Excellence and defe&, on the other hand, are associated merely 
in our conception, with circumstances of birth or fortune, infomuch that men entertain esteem for persons of one condition, and contempt for those of another, upon the mere difference of eflate or of family. Whole nations admire the possession of wealth in themselves, and take rank from the accommodations they possess.
Not satisfied with the gratifications which riches afford, they boast of them as matters of estimation also, and afTume a rate of elevation, which the real degradation of manners and spirit but too often belies.

The national pursuit offuch objects, indeed, are urged to indefinite extent, rather by the interest and ambition of individuals than by the policy of states ; and communities become rich, not fiom the impulse of public institutions, but rather from the ambition of their separate members, who wish to provide for themelves what is confidered as a constituent of superiority in the diiRinctions of rank.

Such is the operation of ambition in the pursuits of wealth.

But, as excellence is more fiequently aflbciated with power than with riches, ambition is commonly more underflood to be a love of dominion, than of wealth. Crassus was eminent for riches,
but was reckoned ambitious so far only as he made wealth subservient to power. Ambition is reckoned the charaCleriftic of Ca(far; because, although indifferent to riches, he aimed at domlinion over his equals, and could not be satisfied with any condition below that of fovcreign of his country. Sylla, though not corcrea in his notion of greatnefs,fiill rose above this idea, and contcmned 
PART I. temned the sovereignty among fools as much as he would have cHAP. III. done their applause or esteem.

The circumflances which lead the mind, in forming these affociations, whether analogy or prevailing opinion, are various; and power is certainly more easily miflaken for comparative elevation,
than either family or wealth. Power is even sometimes founded on the best qualities of human nature,-wifdom, goodness, and fortitude; but, being obtained also by cunning or brutal force, being always diftinguifliable from merit or real worth, it may lead to the nmot pernicious and fatal effedts; or, as it implies fubjetion in some, as well as dominion in others, it is in human life a prin.cipal source of contention, war, and injustice.

Apart from the ruinous effects of violence in the pursuits of 
dominion, it is ungenerous to desire that others fliould be at our mercy, or fubjecd to our caprice; and this desire is sure to make itself enemies, and to meet with refinance, whether from competitors in the fame line of pretension, or fiom others who disdain fu-jedion, and contend for their rights.

If Cato and Antoninus were ambitious in aiming at the higheft measures of personal worth, or, as it is clefcribed in the Cefars of Julian, in aspiring to a resemblance of the supreme God; how vile -nuft the ambition of Caifar appear, in wiflling only to reduce his fellow-citizens and equals, to hold their lives and fortunes at his discretion.

As we may hope, that intelligent beings, sooner or later, in 
the prcfcnt or foi-,'e future state, are (leflined to perceive the true path of ambition; this principle, we acknowledge, is, beneficently, made one of the mott powerfu.l motives of adion in human

nature. Even in its present, too frequently erroneous course, it PART .



serves to engage men in never-ceafing pursuits and exertions; 
which, though aimed at a mistaken end, nevertheless occasion _v\
the improvement of faculties, so intensely applied: Insomuch that we may venture to fRate this passion, even in its moit signal aberrations, as a material principle in the progressive nature of man; operating in all his pursuits; and denying him, even in search of a supply of his animal wants, that repose which nature,
as often as an appetite is fully gratified, seems to allow throughout every other part of the animal kingdom.

Man is born naked, defenceless, and exposed to greater hardships than any other species of animal; and though he is qualisied to drag a precarious existence under these disadvantages, yet as we find him, in the situation of his greatest defet, urged by motives to supply it, no way flort of necessity, so we find him, by a continued application of this motive, which we term ambition,
fill urged to proceed in every subsequent state of his progress.

His society, also, prior to any manner of political eftablifllment,

we may imagine exposed to extreme disorder; and there, also, we may fancy the spur of necessity no less applied than in the urgency of his mere animal wants. From these motives, accordingly,
we admit the arts of human life, whether commercial or political, to have originated, and suppose that the consideration of neceffity muff have operated prior to that of convenience, and both prior to the love of mere decoration and ornament.

The wants of men, indeed, are of different kinds, and may be 
unequally urgent; but the movements, performed for the supply of very different wants, appear to be simultaneous, and bring at 
once 
P.RT I. once into pracice the rudiments of every art, without any fuclt SCr. vPlI order as we might suppose to arise from their comparative degrees 
s^-y of importance, or the urgency of occasions on which they are practifed.

The convenient and ornamental in their several forms, however rude, are itudied in the fame age with the necesSary; and the fame person, who subsists from meal to meal on the precarious returns of the chace, is, in the intervals of his necessity, no less studious of ornament in his person, his dress, and the fabric of his habitation, his weapons, or arms, than he was earnest in procuring his food. He studies the diflindion of ingenious thought and ardent emotion in the song which he recites, or in the talk which he holds in the assembly of his tribe: He conceives an honour to be pursued, and a dignity of charater to be preserved, in which his ambition is not surpassed, even by tlloi who are most effectually relieved from the diftraaions that attend the inferior cares and neceflities of animal life.

Without meaning, therefore, in any degree to insinuate, that 
the pursuits of external accommodation, or the rudiments of commercial arts, had a priority in the order of time, to those of political institution or mental attainment; we may separate these particulars, and place them in the order that appears most convenient for our own difcuflion: Or beginning with commercial arts,
we may proceed to confider the political occupations of men,
before we slate the mental attainments which mankind are actually making, whilst they are engaged in those other pursuits.

The human mind, in whatever manner it be employed, if its Faculties arc brought into excrcife, ever receives bfole incrctent ot

Such in general is the fortune of nations.-They do not propose to improve the charaAer of their people in point of wisdom or virtue; but the people, nevertheless, receive inftruótion and habits of civilization, in the midst of labours bestowed in procuring their subsistence, accommodation, or safety.

Of the Commercial Arts.

PART I.'
 THESE arts, it has been observed, originate in the wants and  necessities of animal life. They are continued, multiplied, and ^cv ~ extended to supply a continued or increasing consumption, and 
to gratify multiplied and accumulating wants: They terminate in the acquisition of wealth, accommodation, and ornament.

It has been observed also, that man's original wants are more 
numerous, and his supply more scanty, than those of any other animal; and the propriety of this condition, in the cafe of a being qualified to provide for himself, and whose progress depends on the exercise of his faculties, has also been stated. With resped to him, the earth being comparatively sterile, or unflocked with spontaneous producions fit for his nourishment, or with animals fit for his service; his skill and his labour are immediately required to felea and to cultivate the useful plant, to breed the serviceable animal, and to remove from his way, the useless or the pernicious of either kind.

What the earth is made by culture to produce, is yet rude, un- PART I.

til it be fabricated, and receive a new form from the hand of 
this artist. Even this hand, though the most accompliflled or- v gan of all those with which any animal is furnished, is not a susficient instrument for all the purposes of art, until it be furnished with a supplement in various engines and tools.

The stores, out of which man is to feleet the materials of art,

are dispersed on the earth, and often concealed at great depths below its surface. A mixture of order, and of apparent disorder in the distribution of these materials, serves to encourage his hopes, and to protract his labours in the search of them.

Veins of metal are seen to stain the clefts of rocks; and ft'ata 
of useful materials, by their oblique position interfering the furface of the earth, give marks of their presence under ground; but the miner must dig to obtain them, and the mineralift has many operations to perform, before his material can go into the hands of the artist, who is to apply it to the several purposes of human life.

The lift of articles that engage the attention of man is not limited to the mere supply of his necessities, whether in point of subsistence or safety: his views extend to decoration and ornament, as well as to use and convenience; nor is ornament less an original want of his nature than either fielter or food. The savage, no less than the polished citizen, affecs decoration in his dress, in the fabric of his arms, and in the apparatus of his person.

H h 2 Although 
PART I. Although man, therefore, when contrasted with the other aCaAP.III.
SCT. IX. nimals, labours under some apparent comparative defedls; yet KW_-\- his superior faculties, employed to supply these defects, soon 
raise him to a state not only of equality, but of advantage greatly superior to theirs.

Though seemingly prest by necefllty, his movements at firit are 
flow, until he receive an additional impulse as he taftes the sweets of supply; they are farther accelerated in proportion as he becomes furnished with tools, and learns to diflribute the tafls of men in society to suit the varieties of their disposition and genius: Ever busy, but never at the end of his wishes; when farthest advanced,
he is only in the way to complete his attainments, but never entirely satisfied with what he has done.

Confidering the supply ofneceffity, in every fociety,as a primary 
concern of the national councils, we are apt to place it among the objects of state; and to think that the blessing of plenty mull depend on the wisdom of those who govern, or who aCt for the community. His own interest, however, is too much the concern of every individual, to be delegated or entrusted into any other hands than his own. It requires, care, industry, and fkil], which are the virtues of private flation; not superior genius, fortitude,
liberality, and elevation of mind,-the virtues of those who are to rule the world.

The commercial arts, therefore, are properly the dilindlive 
pursuit or concern of individuals, and are best conducted on motives of separate interest and private advancement. The rich asfct a superiority in the possession of wealth; and the poor, to escape 
scape from the itate of meanness into which they have fallen, PART T.
frain every nerve to become rich. Upon this motive the trader cHAP.Il 


continues- to labour, even after his necessities are provided for, and -v after his wants might have suffered him to reft.

This motive continues to operate in every situation, at which 
mankind arrive in the progress of arts; or when it ceases to operate in the mind of one person, it is frill active in the mind of some other, who has the fame object of private gain to pursue.
Families, who have long occupied the highest places in the ranks of society, alarmed at the intrusion of those who would partake in their state, endeavour to set a bar in the way of more recent pretensions, bycontending for birth as necessary to conflitute rank.
And we may observe, by the way, that it is perlaps fortunate for mankind that any thing is devised to prevent estimation from becoming the appendage of mere riches alone.

Persons born on a certain elevation, if disposed to worthy pursuits, are more likely to receive iinpreffions and to entertain fentiments becoming their station, than they who have recently arrived at their supposed diflindion by fordid or mercenary arts.

Mere wealth has no natural conneAcion with merit; and, being conceived as a subjed of estimation, is likely to inspire that aukward and often ridiculous, if not odious presumption, which forms the characer of those who are said to be purfe-proud.

Commerce consists in the exchange of commodities, and is 
highly expedient, so far as persons, in consequence of various pursuits and advantages, have mutual redundancies to be difpofed of, and mutual wants to be supplied.

Men 
PART PI Men are made to diversify their employments, not only by a variety of disposition and faculty, but by a variety in the occa% Cfions also which they have to employ them.

The habitable world is diversified in every place; it is diverfli 
fled in refpedl to climate, to the form of its surface, and to the nature of the foil. On the hill or the plain, the inland or the coast, the inhabitant is furnished with separate materials for manufadure, or a separate provision to supply the exigencies of human life.

In every situation, there is or may be procured a superfluity 
of some one or more commodities, while there is, or may be a deficiency in others: But, that the superabundant bounty of nature, in any one article, may be turned to account, it is necessary that the superfluous articles should be exchanged for Something else that is wanting.

Where the surplus and want, in the situation of different persons are mutual, the expedient of exchange required to accommodate the parties, though above the comprehension of any other animal, is perfetly obvious to man. He presents what he has to spare of one kind, as an inducement for his neighbour to supply in return what he wants of another; and, as the accommodation in many cafes may be mutual, the practice of commerce cannot fail to proceed.

It appears to be a condition in the order eflablifhed throughout 
this habitable globe, that no lot is so completely made up, as not to admit of accefion by supply from abroad, and none so deficient 
cient as not to have somewhat to spare. There is no human ta- PART I.
lent so far equal to all the purposes of life, as not to have occa- CHAPTIX.
sion for co-operation or aid; and no person is so far insignificant, kr>
as not to be able, in some particular, to contribute to the welfare of others.

Every place has its aflortment of goods for import and export';

and men are the mutual producers and consumers of the several commodities that make up the aggregate fum of wealth. The manufacturer of China works for the huntsman of Siberia or Labrador. The fifil and the train oil of Greenland are carried in exchange for the wines of Andalusia and the gold of Peru.

The citizen of London or Paris is enabled, at a meal, to furnifh his table with producions that have been supplied from climates and foils the most remote from each other. And we may fancy it to be the object of commerce, or the effect it might serve to produce, were its efforts completely successful, to level the conditions of men in all the variety of their situations; to compensate original defects by adventitious supplies; and to give every commodity a current, from the place at which it is superfluous or abounds, to any other at which it is wanted.

Here, indeed, is a lofty pretension of human art; and the essect is actually such as to raise mankind, in the ages of commerce far above the level of that condition, which they held in a more early state of their progress: But, when we observe them in either extreme offimplicity and rudenefs,or of accommodation and art, or under any of the gradations which lead from the one to the other, they seem to be equally satisfied, or rather equally difsatisfied,

PART I. satisfied in all the varieties through which they are known to CHSp.Cr. pass. They have their different habits that reconcile them equalDoY_ ly to the state in which they are accustomed to live; and whatever that fiate may be, they have their feeling of wants, or their desire offomething better than the present, which ever prompts them to urge on their way; insomuch that, possibly, the fum of gratification or disappointment may be equal in all the different Situations of men.

On this supposition it may be asked, what does the species 
gain in the result of commercial arts, and at the expence of so much invention and labour.

This problem is likely to occur only among speculative men 
in Tome advanced slate of the very arts, of which the value is brought into question, and the merits, when tried before such judges, may be pronounced very different from what they would be found before a different tribunal. The judge, in every infiance consulting his own habits, would pronounce on the abfurdity or the reAitude of manners, and confider as a good or as an evil, the privation or superfluity of conveniencies to which he himfelfis, or is not, accustomed.

But if men, in every age should be thus ready to pronounce 
in favour of their own condition, and to look upon situations,
very different from their own, with dislike or contempt; the queftion would flill return, and might have some appearance of difficulty with those who can divest themselves of prejudice,
or who can allow that contentment is still of equal value in whatever condition it be attained.

On 
On this subjet, however, there are fixed principles to which PART I.



we may recur, and on which, without being under a necessity to SE r.IX.
prove, that the measure of human enjoyment is increased in any wv particular age of commerce, we may nevertheless justify the efforts of mankind to multiply their accommodations, and to increase their stores.

First of all, we may observe, that progress itself is congenial to 
the nature of man; that whatever checks it, is distress and oppreflion; whatever promotes it, is prosperity and freedom: That,
although the fum of attainments, when actually made, should become familiar, should pall on the sense, and become to the possesfor rather a necessary of which he cannot bear to be deprived,
than a source of any positive enjoyment; yet the supposed increase of convenience in every fucceflive ftep may be agreeably felt; and progress itself, to the succession of ages, form a series of gratifications and pleasures, which in any fixed or permanent Rtation could not be obtained.

Even, if we lhould thus be disposed to give up any superiority 
of enjoyment, derivable firom one set of personal accommodations,
in preference to another; the invention and practice of arts relating to such accommodations, have unquestionable value, in the exercise they fur-nifl to the active nature and intelligent power of man.

Such is the nature of man, the party concerned in this question,

that, although by erecting the fabric of commercial arts, and, by accumulating the wealth which they beflow, he flould not, in the mere circumflance of fortune, find the furm of his enjoyments inVOL. I. 1 i creased;

PART I. created; yet,it would not follow, that he has laboured in vain,wlhether in cultivating the ground, or in working the materials which Src'r IX.

-Cv '
r the Author of nature has supplied for his use. It is, indeed, mostly 
in forne active exertions that his happiness consists; and his attainments never can form a condition in which he -may not be e.
qually acfive, and in which, if willing, he may not procure felicity, from the fame source of just or beneficent occupation and exercise; a source which is ever open to him, if not in the ac of procuring the advantages of situation, at least in that of employing them for his own, and the good of his fellow creatures.

We are ever ready to own that labour is prescribed to man;

that he is destined to earn every blefling by the sweat of his brow,
by the labour of his hands, or the exertion of his mind: But we do not always conceive, that there labours and exertions are themselves of principal value, and to be reckoned among the foremost blessings to which human nature is competent; that mere industry is a blessing apart from the wealth it procures;
and that the exercises of a cultivated mind, though confidered as means for the attainment of an external end, are themselves of more value than any such end whatever.

In the progress or result of commercial arts, employments are adapted to all the varieties ofdifpofition, capacity, or genius. Separate departments are opened for the different descriptions of men;
taflks of labour for the firong, of address and sleight of hand for those who are defecive in firength; talks of skill for the inventive and knowing; laws of nature to be investigated, and obfcurities to be cleared up, by the ingenious and comprehensive.

The objec of conmncrce in every department is profit; but 
science 
science itself, by the reward for discoveries which trade can as- PART.I.
ford, may become a lucrative pursuit. 

In the several departments into which the business of trade is 
distributed, it may be observed, that variety of talents being required, the faculties of mind are unequally cultivated. While invention employs the superior genius, and while the diretion of a work requires the enlargement of knowledge; the execution of a single part consisting, perhaps, in a mere movement of the hand or the foot, supersedes every aa of thought or exercise of ingenuity: Insomuch, that the human faculties seem to be as much "suppressed in the one cafe, as they are raised and invigorated in the other: But as the lot of man is never free of inconvenience, so the inconvenience he suffers is never deprived of all compensation.

The savage who performs, however rudely, the several talks of 
human life for himself, though greatly inferior to the scientific performer, may in fact be as much superior to the mere labourer, who is no more than a tool in the hand of a matier artist.
There is a calling in the rude ages of mankind, in which every individual is bred from his infancy, and of which he cannot remit the practice, without extreme danger; that of penetration and sagacity, refpeding the friend with whom he is to co-operate,
or the enemy of whom he is to beware. This, in the last, as well as in the first tfate of mankind, is the tfandard of estimation relating to them; and, while we endeavour to specify the advantage gained by commercial arts, it were mere ignorance to reft the comparative merits of men entirely on this founda.
tion.

Ii The 
PART I. The success of commercial arts, divided into parts, requires a 
certain order to be preserved by those who pracife them, and 
suw implies a certain security of the person and property, to which 
we give the name of civilization, although this diftindtion, both in the nature of the thing, and derivation of the word, belongs rather to the effects of law and political establishment, on the forms of society, than to any slate merely of lucrative poffeflion or wealth.

Civilization has been conspicuous in nations, who made little 
progress in commerce, or the arts on which it proceeds. The Romans had formed a very accomplished republic, and exhibited many an illustrious charaAer; whilfI, in refpet to fanlily estate,
and manner of life, they were nearly in the condition of peasants and husbandmen. The policy of Sparta arose from a principle direcly opposed to the maxims of trade, and went to restrain and to suspend the commercial arts in all their effects. The nation would not have a citizen admired for his wealth, or the equipage of his person: They would not have him occupied with the care of his subsistence or private fortune; and, to procure this exemption for free men, they so far dispensed with the laws of nature and humanity, as to devote, in the capacity of slaves, a particular race of men to perform the labours necessary for the maintainance of the people: They would leave the citizen nothing to care for but his own personal characer and the service of his country.
And they succeeded so far, that, without riches, in the midst of nations who were admirers of wealth, and in the molt cultivated part of the earth, they enjoyed a degree of consideration, superior to that which the lustre even of literary genius and the fine arts,
as well as commerce, bestowed on their neighbours.

In 
In the more ordinary state of nations, however, the arts of PART' I.

subsistence and accommodation constitute a material part, in the 
exercise of those faculties in which human nature is defined to 'improve. Property calls for the security of law; and prudence requires the trader to be fair in his dealing. Virtue, though not as in Sparta, made the principal objeA of policy, will not fail,
in every department of human affairs, to make its own value to be felt: It cannot be dispensed with in any society; nor is that person altogether contemptible, who is fair in his dealings only,
that he may be rich. The merchant is enterprising in his trade;
but, as war exposes him to be plundered, or at least to be disturbed, interrupted, or frustrated of his gains, he is inclined to peace; and ought to be mild in his tranfadions with other nations. These expectations indeed, like many others relating to the influence of circumstances on the will of man, are frequently fruftrated. The Carthaginians had the interest of traders, in the peace of mankind; were themselves unwarlike, and entrusted their military service to foreign mercenaries; but, in their treatment of captives, or vanquished enemies, were nowise more mild or humane than other nations, their contemporaries, of the antient world. They were even noted for cruelty in their superstition, and in the system of their penal laws. Human sacrifices were a part of their rites, and the cross an ordinary engine of puniflhment, for every gradation of guilt.

In the progress, as well as in the result of commercial arts,

mankind are enabled to subsist in growing numbers; learn to ply their resources, and to wield their strength, with superior ease and success. The resources of wealth are increasing, and,
joined to the advantage of a growing energy and frill in the use 
of 
PART I. of them, constitute to nations, who unite the public virtues  with commerce, an acceflidn of security and power.


The obje6c of commerce is wealth: But, in this part of the 
history of man, nevertheless, is evident, what in reality will be found applicable to many other of its parts, namely, that the end,
he proposes to himself, is not to him of so much value as the pursuit in which it engages him, or the means he is led to employ, in the condua of that pursuit.

The end of commercial art is, such a supply of accommodation 
and pleasure, as wealth may procure: But, suppose this end to be obtained at once, and without any effort; suppose the savage to become suddenly rich, to be lodged in a palace, and furnished with all the accommodations or means of enjoyment, which an ample estate 6r revenue can bestow; he would either have no permanent reliih for such possessions, or, not knowing how to use or enjoy them, would exhibit effeds of gross and ungovernable paflion, and a brutality of nature, from which, amidst the wants and hardships of his own situation, he is.in a great measure restrained.

Such we may pronounce to be the effeC of mere wealth, unattended with education, or apart from the virtues of industry, sobriety, and frugality, which nature has prescribed as the means of attainment: But, in the use of there means, the induitrious are furnished with exercises improving to the genius of man; have occasion to experience, and to return the offices of beneficence and friendship ; are led to the fludy of justice, sobriety,
and good order, in the conduct of life. And, thus, in the very progress with which they arrive at the poifrflion of wealth, form 
to 
to themselves a taste of enjoyment, and decency of manners, PART I.
equivalent to a convition that happiness does not consist in the SHAT. IX.
measure of fortune, but in its proper use; a condition, indeed, ,_
upon which happiness depends, no less in the highest, than in the lowest, or any intermediate itate into which nations are led in the pursuit of these, or any other arts.

Of the Tpolitical Arts.

TA:RT I. .As the commercial arts originate in the neceflities of man's aniCHAp.IL. mal nature, the arts which may be termed political, originate he wants and defecs of inftinCive society.

Animals, which are led by their inflinds to form themselves 
into troops or swarms, and to combine their labours for subsistence, accommodation, or safety, are likewise led, by the fame power of inftina, to tome general polity or arrangement of parts,
for the purpose of nature: An infant swarm of bees will follow the queen, or mother of the hive, and wherever she fettles will take their abode. The human species also by the original inItind or destination of nature not only find themselves formed into troops or companies, but ranged also in a way to be directed or governed in numbers together. The will, of one is often a principle of action to many. Tleparent leads his infant child. The courageous and the able take an ascendant over the timorous and 
2 weak.

weak. And not only in the family there is a subordination of PART I.
personal quality of sex and age; but, in every troop or corn- CHAP. X.
pany, some are qualified and disposed to lead; others willing to rbe led. Inequalities of strength, whether of mind or body, conftitute a relation of dependance and power, forming a species of government, which we may term inftincive, because it is prior to any concerted design or institution on the part of those concerned.

The courageous take a station in danger, under which the timid are fain to accept of protetion. The wife point out the way to an end, which every one would gladly attain; and for the attainment of which persons of inferior ability submit to be governed by those of a stronger mind.

We muff not, however, confound the effea of these inequalities in forming a species of actual government, with any supposed right to command in one, or obligation to obey in another. The first person you meet in the itreets, upon a difficulty that occurs.in the way, may win your confidence, and incline you to receive his direcion; but this does not amount to a right in him to command you, nor to an obligation on you to obey him. This right and obligation, as we Ihall have occasion to observe, is founded in convention alone; and can be actually traced to this foundation,
wherever such rights and obligations are really established.

Nor is it necefEary, surely, in this place, to comb at the arguments 
of those, who, in judging of political eftablifliments, recur to the first suggestions of nature, as the model of what mankind are forever bound to retain. Men are destined to improve on their lot and on their first inventions, and no more acquiesce in the first 
Vo L. I K k defeCtive 
PART I defecive forms of society, than they do in the first rudiments of other accommodation, or in the first pratice of any mechanical SECT. X.


We state the condition of rude society, as the material on which 
the genius of man is to work, not as a finished production, with which he is forever to remain contented. In this state we observe that there are, whether from nature or fortune, casual diversities in the slate of the parties, that produce a disparity of rank: That such disparity suggests the claims of prerogative to persons of one condition; inspires others with deference; or, if prerogative be carried beyond certain limits, an alarm, on the subjec of privileges, is taken by those over whom it is claimed.

If, in fixing the date of subordination, we take our accounts 
from antient tradition and record alone, we must assume, that in the rudest times it was known. For, in every instance, we read of transactions that imply the exaltation of particular persons above the ordinary level; we read of patricians, or nobles, who rose above the body of the people; and princes or kings, who rose above the nobles, and who were the heads or leaders of their several communities.

The first fubjeas of history are the wars of such leaders at the 
head.of their followers ; or the contests into which parties were engaged on the subjeA of their refpedive pretensions, whether prerogative or privilege.

Even, if we should suppose, as is probable, that the record of hiflory, in such instances, is not correc, or does not reach far enough 
nough back, to make us acquainted with the earliest Rlate of man- PART I.
kind; and that the condition of savage nations known in our own 

SECT. X.

times, is a better specimen of primeval society: Yet, even amongft them, also, there is a diftinnion of persons, a leader and followers, a felea council of the nation, and a body of the people;
diftintions in which the foundations are actually laid for all the varieties of personal estimation and family diftindion.

When disparities of rank are admitted among the parties which 
compose a society, what Tacitus relates of the ancient Germans may be safely assumed as so many laws of nature, by which men are led before they have planned an establishment: That, in matters of Jnall moment, the chiefs deliberate; but, on great occasions,
all take apart: That royalty is attached to birth, and military command to valour *.

In the result of this natural or inffindive course of things,

small states are inclined to democracy, because a great proportion of the people is easily and frequently assembled. In states of greater extent, the nobles, or fele& class of the people, lay hold of the government, because they have leisure to attend to it, and are easily convened.

In societies of every description, as often as men have consulted 
and have occasion to ad in a body, there is required fbme undivided authority, of which the first and simplest form is that which is conceived in the person of a king or a prince.

K k 2 In 
* Dce minoribus retus principes, de majoribus omnes confultanl. Rcges ex rnobilitate, dluccs ex virtute fumant.

PART I.l In arriving, therefore, even atthe fRate of a principality, in forie 
SECr. X. rude form,there does not appear any concerted design to eftablifi a 
'.<YV., government. Nobility may take its rife from the diftindion ofperfonal qualities; from great ability and courage; from the lutre of great actions; and from the influence of extensive pofleflions. What thus serves to distinguish a particular class or order of men from the multitude, may serve also to distinguish an individual from his order or class; and a superiority thus obtained may be allowed to descend in the race. The offspring of heroes comes into the.world with a lufire borrowed from his progenitors. The child is taught to assume elevation, as he advances in years; and his rank is acknowledged in the refpet that is paid to his blood.

The diftindion of royalty differs from that of nobility only in 
degree, and is of the fame origih. In the first admission of either,
there probably was not any intention to form a constitution, or give method and order to the affairs of state. Such distinctions,
however, when once admitted, nevertheless operate to this effect;
and, before men had conceived the design of a political infiitution, or came under the supposed stipulation of magifirate and fubjedA, they have already ranged themselves into different orders; of which one is in a condition to govern, and another in a state to obey.

So far, then, we may be inclined to think that the casual 
subordinations, not only of sex, age, and personal qualities, but those likewise of birth and fortune, may have preceded any formal intention to regulate the distribution of power.

But the forms which arise in this manner from inftincs of nature,

ture, although they may serve for ages the purpose of political efta- PART I.
bliihment, are however no more than a rude material on which CSEA.IIX.
the ingenuity of man is to be exercised. And his original lot in _

this as in other instances, calls at first for his efforts to remove inconveniences which arise in it, rather'than to improve the advantages of which it is susceptible; although, in process of time, men have recourse to many infcitutions and conventions for both those purposes.

The defeCts of a rude society consist, either in a want of order at home, or in the want of security against invasions from abroad.

Disorders at home arise from the collision of private interests 
and passions; or from the interfering of private with public and common concerns. In the simplest society, even that of a family, parties may divide on the fubjeft of personal confiderations, and the individual may apprehend an interest for himself apart from the common cause of his kindred.

Under such apprehensions, the effets, whether of natural asseCtion, of brotherly love, or of family attachment, may be prevented or greatly disturbed; and political institutions appear to have been at first suggested by the abuse to which society is expofed, in its casual Rtate, whether of subordination or anarchy.

At one time, an institution is required to strengthen the hands 
of those who govern, against popular licence, or private crimes.
At another time, it is required to fix the limits of power, or to guard against its abuse.

Ki'-V recourse to the description of rude or unpolifhed hordes of our 
own times, we may conclude equally from either, that the first object of concert or convention, on the part of man, is not to give society existence, but to perfedt the society in which he finds himself already by nature placed; not to eftablifih subordination, but to correct the abuse of a subordination already established: And that the material, on which the political genius of man is to work, is not, as the poets have feigned, a Scattered race, ina state of individuality to be colleded together into troops, by the charms of music, or the lessons of philosophy. But a material much nearer the point to which the political art would carry it, a troop of men by mere inftind assembled together; placed in the subordinate relations of parent and child, of noble and plebeian, if not of rich and poor, or other adventitious, if not original diftindion, which constitutes, in fact, a relation of power and dependance, by which a few are in condition to govern the many, and a part has an ascendant over the whole.

The idea of men in any society, great or finall, having ever 
afembled upon a foot of absolute equality, and without exclulion of any individual, to dispose of their government is altogether visionary and unknown in nature. Even where the inhabitants of the smallest diftrid or village, with the moRs determined resolution to equalize the rights of men, have assembled, not to deliberate on national affairs, but to eledc delegates for that purpose, half the people, under the diftindion of sex, are excluded at once even from the right of eledtion; a third of the remaining half under the diftindion of nonage; still more under other accidental diftindtions; and, where the remainder is not un.ninmolu, and must aA by the majority, this governing part of

These exclusions are made upon the foot of a power in those,

who arrogate government, not upon a foot of content in those who are fubjeded to it. Even the government of the majority,
for which there could be no convention, unless the people were unanimous, proceeds upon a mere overbalance of power. Two may over-rule one by the superiority of force; but this does not amount to a right, in any one species of actual government whatever. Providence, indeed, has kindly determined, that,
wherever there is society there should also be government, of some kind or other, to provide for the peace and co-operation of its members. The form of society, like other materials provided for human ingenuity to work upon, may be rude or defective,
and require the exercise of reason to remove its inconveniencies, or to obtain the advantages of which it is susceptible. But the object of reason never can be to abolifhl the relation of power and dependence; for this nature has rendered impossible; but, to guard against the abuses of power, and procure to individuals equal fecurity in their refpetive flations, however differing in point of acquired or original advantages.

We are not now inquiring what men ought to do, but what is 
the ordinary trac in which they proceed, and how far the exercises of their political situation is a part in that school of intellectual and moral improvement, in which they are deffined to advance in knowvedge, wisdom, and all the eligible habits of life. Mankind muif be contented to aa in the situations in which they find themselves placed; and, except when urged by great occasions, seldom project, and rarely at once obtain, any great innovation.

change, where either prevail. Even if the society should be led at any particular time, by a single person of distinguished influence and authority, as in the examples of Lycurgus, Solon, or Romulus, to adopt at once a plan consisting of many regulations;
still the effect could be no more than to define the condition in which parties should ac, and in which they might find occasions no less trying and complicated, than those in which they would have been otherwise engaged. A slate governing itself upon the plan of Romulus might have found no less to do for its members,
than they themselves would have otherwise found in the condition of shepherds or robbers, the nursery from which this celebrated lawgiver is supposed to have colleced the firif members of that famous republic, which is supposed to have taken the first principles of political order from him.

The institutions ascribed to those celebrated lawgivers did 
not put an end to the political operations of slate; they only placed the members of society in situations to adt with advantage for the preservation and welfare of their country. Every new emergence required new measures for this purpose: And the law itself,
however simple in a rude age, muff have multiplied its clauses to keep pace with the growing affairs of a prosperous nation; and its application to questions of contested right, of criminal charge, or public arrangement, muff have required continued attention on the part of the governed as well as the governing. Under the most accomplished institutions of government, it remained for the citizens, in every instance, to constitute and to wield the force of their community, whether for the suppression ofdiforders at home,
or the rcpulfion of inj uries from abroad.

It is the foil on which human genius is deflined to receive a principal-part of its nourishment, and to make the most vigorous shoots of which its nature is capable.

In this point of view, the attainment of a just political order 
otherwise so -necessary to the welfare of mankind, is to be confidered also as an occasion on which the principal fleps of man's progress are made, or in which a scene is opened that gives scope to his adive disposition, and is fitted, like other parts of his lot,
to improve his faculties by rendering the exercise of them neceffary to his preservation and well-being.

As the necefiities of animal life might have been fewer than 
they are at present, or might have been entirely prevented; so the exigencies of civil society might have been supplied and regulated by mere inflinc1, as they are in the cafe of other animals, so as not to require any efforts of design or contrivance on the part of its members. Nature, however, has otherwise arranged the fortunes of man; and so disposed of his lot, that, being provided with intellectual faculties, he ever meets with a suitable occasion by which they are called forth into use.

We have not the experience neceffary to decide this question, nor the means of comparing the effeCts of mere society with those of absolute solitude. Men are every where assembled in troops together; and, although varieties in the conflitution of government give them unequal occasions to employ their faculties, and we are thereby enabled to compare the effe6s of different political situations together; yet,
we are not, by any actual experience enabled to judge how far the least perfect form of society should be preferred to. the entire feparation of the individual from his kind.

On this qucftion, indeed, we might even without the help of 
experience, asSume, a priori, that minds should become enlightened, in proportion as they have occasion to receive information from the frequent' difcufflon of fubjeds, which they are concerned to understand.; that they fliould acquire ability and strength of mind, from the neceflity of deciding on the interests,
whether public or private, which they are concerned to support.
And the history of mankind las confirmed our conjecture in this matter: It has abundantly fliewn, in. the inflance of republican governments, that the attainments of knowledge, ability,
and public virtue, are proportioned. to the concern which numbers are. permitted to take, in the affairs of their community;
and to the exertion of ingenuity and public spirit, which they have occasion to make in national counsels, in offices of Rate, or public iervices of any fort.

differ in refpea to the national exertions they have made, so they differ also in refpea to the attainments of cultivated genius:
Hence probably the inequality of nations, both in antient and modern times.

The very evils that afflict society, and the divisions that seem to 
endanger its being, make a part in the scene that is prepared for the inftrucion of its members. Their lesions are taken in scenes of contest and trouble, as well as of co-operation and peace. 'Refiflance of wrong is itself an afion ofjuftice: And in this, or any other effort of genius, difficulty tries and sharpens the wits of men.
This whetstone is found, by the votary of science, in the intricacy ofthofe natural appearances which he firives to explain; by the mechanic, in the stubbornness of the matter on which he would work;
and it is found, by the free and ingenuous citizen, in the resistance he meets with, from interests and opinions opposed to his own.

The difficulties and impediments which men of ability, in opposition, mutually furnish, are greater than those which are met with in fludy however abstruse, or in the practice of arts, however laborious or nice. In the contest of human abilities, invention is continually at work; obftrucions are mutually presented; and if the genius of one person surmount the difficulties opposed to him, that of another is employed frill to supply, in the fame way,
some frefli occasion of labour. The scene requires penetration,
sagacity, and fortitude. Henry the Fourth of France, fays the president Hainault, met with the circumifances which try, and

of so much contention, upon his free and ingenuous nature, was not a rancorous animosity to the parties who had opposed him;
but a liberal use of the experience he had gained, in affability and good will, to the different orders of persons, who, in the end,
were committed to his government.

To the mind, which is by nature endowed with a discernment 
of retitude and truth, the experience even of evil, may lead the way to what is good. Society, in which alone the diftinaion of right and wrong is exemplified, may be confidered as the garden of God, in which the tree of knowledge of good and evil is planted; and in which men are destined to diflinguifh, and to chufe, among its fruits.

The paths of beneficence and justice are open, and marked 
with every engaging diftin&ion of approbation, esteem, and honour. Those of injustice and malice are the resorts of error,
ignorance, and unhappy pafions. The sentiments that refer to this diftinAion, are greatly enhanced by the sympathy and contagion of social natures; insomuch, that whatever opinion we may form of the possible existence of any such sentiment in the mind of an individual, detached from his kind; we cannot doubt of its being greatly promoted in the communication of numbers together.

The atmosphere of society, from the whole, we may conclude,

is the element in which the human mind muif draw the first breath of intelligence itself: or if not the vital air by which the celestial

to use a familiar example, may be compared to those blocks of Wv fuel which taken apart are hardly to be lighted: but if gathered unto heap are easily kindled into a blaze.

Language is the instrument of society; and, we may presume,

is not employed in any other matter but what the communications of society require; a consideration from which it should seem to follow, that man is indebted to society for every exercise of his faculties,. of which language is formed to express the attainment or the use; a title under which we may fairly comprehend all the efforts of understanding or genius.

The affairs of society require the light of science, as well as 
the direction of a virtuous conduct; insomuch that the recluse,
by investigating the laws of nature, which relate to the concerns of men, is no less employed for his country than the most active of its servants; or than those who are moit occupied in difcharging the functions of state.

The fine arts, too, with all the elegant produtions of fancy 
or taste, spring from the flock of society, and are the branches or foliage which adorn its prosperity, or actually contribute to the growth and vigour of the plant.

The moral science also springs from this flock; and has a perpetual reference to society, as the school from which its lessons are taken, and to which their applications are made, whether in prescribing the social duties of men, the laws by which they

the progress of youth, by this measure, perhaps with too little attention to the habits of life they are forming in that early period.

The mind, desirous of information, is, by its powers of perception, observation, and memory, ever making some addition to its stock, whether in the colleetion of particular sacs and fpecimens, or in the comprehension of a general order, according to which particulars are arranged in the system of nature.

The material world in all its parts and movements, the minditself in all its operations and passions, are the fields of perception and confcioufncfs. In each, fads are fucceffivcly admitted, in adx: dition 
PART I. dition to those which had been already observed; and, until old CaAP.III.
ECT. X'I Qage begin to impair the powers of recollection and melnory, every 
- new incident becomes an accession to the fum of knowledge.

In the terms, History and Science, as hath been already observed, we may include the different modifications of human apprehension, either as it relates to particular saCs, or to the general order in which they are connected together.

History consists in the detail of particulars: Science consists in the knowledge of general principles and their applications.

The world presents an indefinite number of individual beings,

and of operations, sacs, and events. To perceive, and to remember a particular objec does not appear to be above the competence of mere animal life: But the talk of intelligence is greatly superior. This task is to observe, in the multitude of individuals, the specific character; in the multitude of species,
to observe the generic description; in the multitude of genera,
to observe the class or order of being, under which they may be separately ranged; and, in the multitude of operations and fats,
to observe the law of nature, according to which they proceed.

Such is the order of things resulting from the energy of Eternal 
Providence, or, in the language of Plato, Such are the ideas of Eternal Mind, which, when thus realized, furniflh an objed of contemplation congenial to the apprehension even of created intelligence, though greatly extended beyond the limits of its adual comprehcnfion.

Even to the human mind, a world of particulars is agreeable,
so far only as the general form is understood ; and the natural 
plrogrfc;

progress of knowledge, to which men aspire with so much avi- PART I.
dity, is, from particular specimens, to the general combination SECr. XII
and system of the whole. Multiplicity without order diftraas ~Y
and perplexes the mind; and the highest species of suffering,
perhaps, that could be devised for a being merely intelligent,
would be for him to look round on a world of numberless individuals, of which no two had any resemblance or connelion together.

The present world were adually such a chaos to the human 
mind, if it were not qualified to single out what the Grecian philofopher above mentioned calls the One in many, and to wield the indefinite multitude of things, under general denominations expreflive of the common description or form in which numbers agree.

The knowing is diffinguifhed from tlc ignorant, no doubt, by 
the greater number of particulars he has perceived or observed;
but still more by his proficiency in comprehending the many un.der the few denominations, in which they are or may be flated.
And the superiority of science to ignorance cannot, perhaps, be better illustrated, than by comparing the cafe of a person who can read, to that of another to whom the use of letters is entirely unknown. To the mere illiterate savage, the multiplied pages of a book, with all its individual type marks or characters, form a mass of inextricable confusion and perplexity, from which he turns away with difguf and horror. I once turned up the pages of a book to Oilai, the native of Otaheite, who was lately in 
nglland ; and he appeared to be so much diflrefFed, that I repented I h.il done so. Such, also, to a mind which had no dif4ernimcnt of meaning or order in the fyflem of nature, would be

PAR'r I. the indefinite multitude of particulars, detached from one another,

HECT. XI. or in which no system could be perceived.

But as to a person who has learned to read, the pages before 
him are diftinguithed into sentences and periods of description,
narration, or argument, under general titles o-f composition; as Sentences are resolvable into words, and these into letters, clafled into vowels and consonants, with their refpeAive powers of articulation or found; no embarrassment or perplexity arises from the apparent multiplicity of type-marks on every page, nor from the mere multiplicity of pages, in a work which is otherwise properly executed. Such we may conceive to be the universe of God to the mind that comprehends it; or rather, perhaps, to the almighty and intelligent power of its Creator alone.

An author of much authority, * in his introduction to a tranflation of some Hindoo verses on the subj-et of the Creation,
observes, " That the difficulties attending the vulgar notion of " material fubitances, induced many of the wisest among the " antients, and some of the most enlightened among the moderns,
" as well as the Hindoo philosophers, to believe that the whole "creation was rather an energy than a work, by which the in"finite Mind, who is present at all times and in all places, exhi" bits to his creatures a set of perceptions like a wonderful pic" ture or piece of music, always varied yet always uniform.

With less violence to the ordinary perceptions of men, we may 
indeed confider the material world as made, not for itself, but for the mutual communication of minds, and forming, a system of

discourse, composed of parts and subdivisions, proceeding, in the wy original or creative mind, from generals to particulars; but, in the mere observer, to be traced by .a laborious induction from the indefinite variety of particulars, to some notion of the general mold or forms in which they are cast.

To the comprehending mind, as the variety offubjeds in nature 
is reduceable to a few genera, species, and classes of being; so the operations of nature are reduceable to a few general and comprehenfive laws.

The object of hiflory, we have said, is detail; but even in such 
instances the ingenuity of a compiler is distinguished as much by the aptitude of his general method, as by the terms of his description in treating of singular specimens. Even the vulgar recur to method in enumerating their fubjets. And so obvious is the order established in nature, that the progress made by the learned in perceiving it, though great, bears but a small proportion to the general arrangement, which is perceived no less by the vulgar,
than it is by the greatest adept in natural history.

But on the skirt of a world, in which so much is already comprehended by every intelligent being, who is destined to bear a part in its movements; singular or anomalous appearances exercise the ingenuity of a few; who, by referring such appearances to some class of fads or law of nature already familiarly known, but not yet applied to this effect, acquire to themselves the honours of science or profound discovery.

For the fame rcafon that fubjecs of description, to be compreM I i 2 hencled

The boundless region of individual facds mufft be divided into compartments, and ranged under the title of acive powers; in each of which the esfence or energy is conceived to be one, although displayed in the numberless repetition of separate operations.

The pressure of weight operating individually in separate fads 
through every mass, and every particle of matter, is comprised at once in the general term gravitation. And other fads are dillin.
guifhed from these, and from one another, in the terms Magnetifi, Elecricity, Coheflon, EleAive Attraction, Heat, Vegitation,

Under each of these is conceived a boundless multiplicity of particular examples and fpecimens, which, presented without connexion or arrangement, would overwhelm or diffract the mind; but separated into kind and species, form a comprehensible system of operations, that combine together, or balance one another in the oirder of nature.

Gravitation is diflinguilfed by its pressure in the vertical line;

MIagnetifin by its limitation to the loadstone and iron, with alternate attraction and repulsion at the opposite poles. Elelcricity by its limitation to the excited eleccric and specific conductor,

Vegetation is limited to organized bodies, receiving by their 
roots, branches, or leaves, increment or change of substance, from the anion of foil, air, and light.

Animal life is limited to sense and voluntary motion or aCtion of any fort.

Intelligence operates in design, observation, choice, and will;

It is traced in contrivances suited to an occasion, and varied as the occasion requires.

Without attempting a full enumeration of all the powers that 
operate in the system of nature, there may be admitted in the number, as principal examples of the kinds or species under which the principles of action and life may be diftinaly conceived. The objec of science, with respect to any such principle, confidered apart, is to ascertain its reality, and investigate the mode of its operation, to be stated in terms of a general law, colleeed from the detail of facts, and applicable to explain the phenomena, or diversified iitances in which it takes place.

a lhus the law of gravitation, with a force proportioned to the'

quantity of matter, operates equally in bodies whether at reft or in motion; and, at different distances, it operates with a force invcrfely as the fquarc of the dilftance. Thus ascertained and combined with the laws of motion, it fcrvcs to account for the continued revolution of the moon and other planets in their orbits ;
for the ebbing and flowing of the fca, the proceflion of the equi1noXeS,

PART I. noxes, and other phenomena, from which the law of gravitation CILAP.II1. if sot otherwise known, could never have been learned.


In such theories as these the ingenuity of Scientific research is abundantly conspicuous: But the desire of comprehension in the human mind is fogreat,that even the operating powers which have now been mentioned, though under titles so few, appear too many.
The whole, or greater part, it is supposed, may be resolved into impulse; the faa with which we are so familiar, and of which we think ourselves so well qualified to assign the nature or the essence. In pursuit of such general theory, attracion and repulsion of every kind are conceived to be the impulse of fluid streams,
pressing bodies to unite or to separate. Even thought itfelfis resolved into a collision or motion of matter in subtile fluids or particles indefinitely small. And the attempt to form such theories, however little fatisfalory serves to evince the dilpofition to generalization which we are now confidering.l 
The love of science and the love of system are the fame: but 
this passion may disappoint itself by pushing forward too fast without employing the means which are required to obtain its end.

The laws of nature are investigated by a careful attention to 
the particulars in which they are known to exist; and theories are formed by a like attention to the phenomena, which the laws of nature may serve to explain: But men are often in hafle to conceive the iyftem, without attending to the parts of which it is formed; and apply the law without comparing its power with the measure of cffed. The pafiion by which they are urged is busy in every breast; and the ordinary race of men in every nation and in every age, are greatly advanced in the gratification of it. The 
merest 
Savage has conceived a scheme of nature upon which he ads; PART I.
and, when new phenomena occur, he endeavours to refer them CHAPAIr.

.

to Come law or predicament of being already known to himself; rw or if this be impracticable, he imagines some new principle better fitted to serve the purpose.

This last expedient is well known under the name of HypotheJis;

and sometimes leads to an error, in the substitution of fancy for reality; which, though the vulgar be not altogether exempt from it,
is more frequent in the speculations of the learned, than in the practical notions of ordinary men,

New fats may sometimes suggest a new principle in nature,

as accidental appearances suggested the principles of electricity and magnetifin, very real in their several departments,though not generally known as properties of matter. The first apprehension,
therefore, of any such principle, in the form of a supposition or hypothesis to be examined, is by no means to be rejected in the pursuits of knowledge: But the final substitution of mere imagination for reality, is an abuse by which the love of science has been most frequently frustrated or misled; and yet, even in this,
the mind finds an occasion of exercise, by which its faculties are in Come degree improved,and intelligence, in formation of the moil fanciful system, is raised above the level of mere animal perception and memory.

Men advance in real feience by tracing faas to their general laws,

and by applying there laws to phenomena, which of themselves never would have suggested the law. Human knowledge, therefore,
begins and ends with particulars. Itis promoted in various ways.
in continuing to exifl, minds have occasion to learn; in the praócice 
of 
PART I. of arts, and in the conduc of life, events have the effec of experi
C H IP. xll ment, and make some addition to the fund of knowledge. The mer~'v' chant, in search of a market, at which he may buy or fell with advantage, explores the globe, and colle&s information from the utmost bounds of the earth. The traveller or the mariner, that he may have a guide to his movements below, observes the heavens above, and subdivides the universe itfelfby his lines and his circles.

The lovers of science invent methods of calculation or meafurement, to be employed in comparing the quantities of cause and effect; and they seize with avidity every new appearance of fat, upon the mere supposition of its leading to some farther acquaintance with the fyRfem of nature.

Such is an important part of the measures, which providence 
has taken to fix the attention, and to lead the observations of men;
and by this means to softer the powers of intelligence with habits of sagacity and penetration. The faculties thus employed are improved by exercise; and knowledge is to the mind what aliment is to the growing body, the means of enlargement, and accefflon of power and strength.

Knowledge of the laws of nature, and the application of such 
laws to explain their phenomena, are not merely, like method in the details of descriptive history, a form of arrangement, for the purpose of comprehension and memory: They lead to the possession of power,or the command of events. For in proportion as men become acquainted with the circumflances required to the production of any natural effect, or know the law according to which any natural operation proceeds; if the subject be within their reach, or the circumstances under their command, they arc thereby enabled to jrepcat the operation, and obtain its effct. Thus men, knowing 
the

convey water in close pipes over inequalities of ground. Know- 



ing the polarity of the magnet they construct the mariner's cornpass; and knowing the laws of vision, they conftrud optical inftruments, to extend the limits of fight beyond its ordinary bounds,
whether in the diflance or minuteness of objects.

Although science is most profitable to those who obtain it by their 
own efforts, and who, together with knowledge, acquire habits of observation, sagacity, penetration and memory; yet it is communicable to others by mere information; and if in those who receive it, the energy of understanding be awake, to examine its foundations and to pursue its consequences; science may become in a manner indigenous wherever it is planted. The suggestions of individuals pervade entire societies of men; spread over nations, and descend to subsequent ages however remote.

The lights of science, even in fubjets the most abstruse, are in 
some measure diffused into every corner of a prosperous society.
They direc the hand of the artist in his work-shop. They are made a part in the course of every liberal education. They furnif the methods of thought and comprehension to those who deliberate on affairs, and, by entering into the ordinary converfations of men, become familiar in the commerce of life. So that the most retired student of nature, in extending the limits of knowledge, works for his community; separate communities mutually work for one another, for ages to come, and for mankind. And attainments in this branch, perhaps more than in any other, may be confidered, not as local advantages gained to any particular society of men, but as steps in the progress of the human fpecics itself.

Who knows but, in some former age, the pressure of the air was known, and led the mechanic in the construction of his pump; as the operation of this engine, or the phenomenon of fudtion, after its principle had efcaped, has led the inquisitive to observe the operation of weight in the atmosphere.

The successful application of science, to the prodution ofeffects,

is the laift and most convincing evidence of its reality, or of the truth of its principles. If we flould be disposed to contest the laws of refraction and reflexion of light, or the theory of vision,
which is founded upon them; their fiiccefsful application to the conftrution of optical instruments, would be an irrefiragable evidence of their truth. The art of conducing lightning is an cvidence of the theory, which resolves this phenomenon of the heavens into eledrical matter.

wife serve to recommend the study, and to promote the accep- 
tance of it with'mankind. The subserviency of mental attainments, even to the purposes of animal life, is an efftetual incitement to the progress of mind.

As mere information received, without the habits of sagacity 
and penetration, formed in the. acquifttion of science, is of inferior effect in the human mind; it appears to be wifely ordered by providence, that nations, for the most part, however aided by lights from abroad, should have the fabrics of science and art to ered for themselves; and, in examining what they receive from others, should nearly perform the labours ofinveftigation, though without depending, for the result of their inquiries, upon any of the chances to which they are frequently indebted for new discoveries.

As if it were intended, that the desire of man to comprehend 
the order of things should not be gratified, without affording a proper exercise to his faculties, nature has but in part revealed the most obvious of her laws. The vertical pressure of gravitation, pervading the mechanical system, and obvious in so many instances, is justly deemed universal; yet is it, at certain intervals, even in this system, loft to the view, or hid under contradictory and perplexing appearances. The rain falls from its cloud;
but the cloud itself is suspended, and other vapours equally dense ascend in the atmosphere.

Thus, nature, of old, was supposed to have a principle of levity,
as well as of weight: And the floating of bodies comparatively

PART T. light, in a fluid that is specifically heavier than the body immer fed in it, though a phenomenon of mere gravitation, remained to 

Sr X.be known as such in the iequel of intense observation and reasoning; and the attention which was required to make this difcovery, served, at the fame time, to secure the acquisition offcience to those by whom it is made.

In refpea to mere animal life, science is the foundation of practical skill or art. In refpea to the mind, it is an advance, from whatever distance, to that all-comprehenfive intelligence, from which the system of nature derives its existence and its form.

Of the Fine Arts.

AMIDST the arts which man has occasion to pradlife for the PART I.
supply of his necessities, or the uses of animal life; and amidst CHAIP.IIthe researches in which he is engaged to obtain the knowledge of v a system, of which he himself is a part, and in which he is so deeply concerned; he is also disposed to invent and to fabricate for himself works in which he would give scope to his faculties,
and enjoy the immediate fruits of his own ingenuity, in its mere application or exercise.

Of these works most are projected upon those models of excellence and beauty, in which nature so often excites his admiration and supplies his delight: Even where he has in view to obtain some purpose of mere animal life, he often exceeds what this object alone would suggest. He would adorn what is useful, and accomplish a form, of which the effect, though conjoined with the supply of 
his 
PART I. his neceflities or acconmmodations, is very different from what CSAX.II. these purposes alone would require.


This double purpose, of ornament and use, is evident in the 
faihion of his dress, in the architeclure of his dwelling, and in the form of his equipage, or furniture of every fort.

In addition, also, to such of his works as are executed for infirution, and the communication of knowledge, he fludies elegance of manner, and beauty of composition, even beyond what is necessary to the principal merit of information or fcience.

In other instances the human mind affecs to create, and would 
furnifih the matter as well as the form of its works. Such is the Poet's aim;-a name which, in its origin, signifies a maker, and implies a contradiftinaion to those who merely avail themselves of what is made. The disposition to this branch of the arts, is such as to make mankind affect the merit of invention, in preserence to that of observation or judgement, which are so much required to the successful conduct of invention itself, and so essential to man, as an actor in the real scenes of human life.

Mere efforts of ingenuity, which are thus made to adorn what 
is otherwise useful and necessary, or to gratify an original difpofition of the mind to fabricate for itself on the models of beauty -)resented in nature, are commonly termed the fine arts.

Of this last description are chiefly the arts of poetry, painting,

sculpture, and music: And, of tefe, the three former, although they give scope to invention and creative fancy, are so much 
employed 
employed in copying from nature, that they are sometimes also PART I.
termed the imitative arts. They differ in refpeA to the means .
which they employ for imitation; whila they agree in the en- r deavour to procure, by artificial expedients those pleasures of the imagination, and that interest of the passions, which belongs to real objects of admiration, or sentiment of any fort.

The Greeks had, in real life, their atchievements of heroism 
and valour ; but the poet would found in their ears his song of adventures and passions more marvellous that those. In the streets of Athens, were occasions of distress to excite commiseration and terror; but theatres were erected for the exhibition offcenes still more piteous and terrible. In the person of many a living citizen were exhibited the most noble figures and exquisite models of grace and beauty: but the temples, the porticoes, and other public buildings were hung with pictures or crowded with flatues of gods and heroes more beautiful or august than any of the figures to be met with in real life.

In there imitations of nature, the painter, with his outline, colour, and distribution of light and shade, gives apparent relief or prominence even to plain surface. And the sculptor, rejecting the use of colour, vies with nature in point of solid dimension and form.

But the firlf and most wonderful production of human genius 
is language. In this the created mind is itfelfa creator. Worlds in the language of Plato, have sprung from the ideas of Eternal Mind; and language is the emanation of idea in the mind of man.
The material of expreflion, whether gellure or found, is furnifhied by nature ; but its significance is the creation of mind intelligent 
3 , and 
PART I. and sociable. Wherever such minds exist, the measure of eftfe  keeps pace with the measure of the cause. In proportion as minds 

are knowing, comprehensive, and ingenious; language is copious and regular, composed of generic expressions in every department of thought, and these brought down to particulars, by specific or individual variations, with clear and luminous forms of inflexion and conftrution.

Whatever peculiar advantage belongs to the sculptor's chiflel,

or the painter's pencil, the orator and poet prefer the use of language; and, with this wonderful engine, accomplish works in many refpeds superior to the mere imitations of colour or form,
in any dimension, superficial or solid.

Painting and sculpture are circumscribed in the choice of their 
subje&s, and limited to single conjundures and points of time.
They are indeed diretly applied to the senses, and present the thing by imitation and resemblance, not by the intervention of mere arbitrary signs, under which the sense may susser from the want of interpretation. But the inventions of poetry, to compenfate this defedt, may be indefinitely varied: They may consist in the objed of a single passion, whether admiration and delight, grief,
indignation, or ridicule, expressed in the strains of an ode, an elegy,
or satire. They may consist of extended relation, fictitious or real,
in which many persons and charaters bear a part; and in which fuccefive events are exhibited, as in the strains of heroic narrative poetry, or dramatic representation.

In all there arts, we are told there is imitation; but, the attempt is rather to new model the forms of nature to our own purpose or tafic, than to preserve them such as they acdually arc.

5~.1r~~ ~~We 
We would clear the garden of its weeds, and introduce uniform-i- PART I.
ty, where nature exhibits indefinite variety. We would call forth, cHAPT-,I.
under single points of view, those characters of human nature .n-v which appear in: all the diversities of life. We .would present the miser only in aas of avarice ;: the spendthrift, in ads ofprodigality; the high minded, in ads of elevation and courage. All that we would preserve of nature is a true copy of the part we fele:; and vie with her in the interesting scenes which take place in the world, rather than produce a mere likeness or servile copy.

It may however be asked in this place, and before we proceed 
any farther, what is this charateriftic of beauty, in which man pretends in his works to vie with nature, and Sometimes even to improve upon the model which nature has left.

The question has been frequently Rated, and is no doubt matter 
of very important inquiry. The taste of beauty may seem to be conversant about corporeal forms, and to meet with its object in the roundness of a sphere, in the flowing bend of a line, or surface; in single tints of colour, or notes of music: In all or in any of these instances, there may be a pleasurable afrociation of thought or emotion; but this objedC would soon lead us to overlook any.forms which have no fixed relation to mind, in. order to arrive at what has been termed the first excellent, and first fair, the specific source of enthusiasm and love, of which the fighteft ray, emitted or refletedby any coporeal form, bestows that species of admiration and delight, which we term the sentiment of beauty, even in matters of sense. But this investigation properly belongs to the branch of moral philosophy; in which we enquire what is good, under any or 
VOL. I. 0 o all

PART I. allits denominations ; and, under this, of the excellent or beauti 
S$cr.XU. ful among the reft.

In the mean time, we may observe that it appears to be the 
cbjea of what are termed the fine arts, to exercise the faculty and accomplish the ends of human ingenuity, in the force and justice of Lentiment, and in the intelligent arrangement of parts in a work whether simple or complicated.

In tie works of men, there may be a beneficent purpose obtained by reasonable means. In literary compositions, for instance,
whether of history or of science, instruction may be obtained by a judicious arrangement of the subjed, and a luminous application of evidence to the discernment of truth, or the correction of error. This end may be obtained by a propriety and aperfpicuity of expressions; or, as Dr Swift defines the beauty of style, by the use of proper words in proper places. To such works, the epithets of good writing, of ingenuity, or of beautiful compofi.tion, may be promiscuously applied,

The poet being free to chufe his materials, as well as the form 
he is to give them, may felea the subjeA of his fable, and fill up the supposed incidents in a manner to exhibit the most inftructive and interesting representation of human adion and character.

In the poetic scene, benevolence, integrity, and elevation of mind,

whether in prosperity or adversity, may be so truly placed in the view, as to win the affections, and determine the choice,
independant of the events with which the efforts of virtue may be attended. The contrary vices may be brought into view,
under just colours of deteflation or contempt, which no profpcrity of fortune can remove, or compensate: And works of such 
3 bencficcnt 
beneficent tendency may be executed, with so much judgement, PART I.
and such a power of elocution, as to carry the clearest evidence S
of a commanding force or intellectual ability, joined to that C/-vyardour of affesion and sentiment, on which we bestow the appellation of superior genius; and which, transfusing itself into the work it performs, entitles the producion itself to the proportional praise of excellence and beauty.

The painter, or the statuary, may vie with the poet in the 
moral of his performance, and in the merit of its execution: In his work, also, we find the power of invention, and a just conception brought forward to the view, by the masterly hand of an artifi. Human figures, whether presented singly, or in groups, are the elements of which the work is composed; and the artist has an opportunity, by seizing or amplifying the graces, with which the human form is diftinguiflled in nature; by employing its expreflions of intelligence, benignity, or elevation, to give his compositions the best moral effec, and to secure that effect by the admired execution of a skilful performer.

In all these instances, the material form is recommended by the 
presence of ingenuous design and intellectual ability, the supreme objecRs of esteem and refped. Works, deficient in these particulars, and even works of a pernicious tendency, may have a temporary vogue, from casual circumstances, or the caprice of fashion; but. the human mind, when such circumfiance and lfahions have spent their effecs, must ever return to the true -tandard of cifimation, and require the merit of goodness and wisdom, to confiitute a permanent beauty.

'lhe progress of fine arts has generally made a part in the hiso(!-V Of- p roficrous nlitiolls; and, it is obcfrvcd, that poetry, even 
0 o 2 cf 
PART I. of the highest species, has been the first among the productions of art, to attain certain high measures of excellence. When we conSEcT.XlI.

r~-.v fider, that such works are the most difficult, and the least to be 
obtained by the ordinary capacities of men; the fact is a paradox; yet abundantly verified in the history of mankind; and we may think ourselves qualified to explain it, although no one could have foreseen, that the efforts of genius were to have made their appearance in this order .

The style of poetry is different from that of ordinary discourse;

but, to the perbon who spontaneously employs it, and whose mind soars above vulgar conceptions, an elevated style is natural, and the flight of imagination is sustained with a force that may lead at once to the highest attainments.

Although genius, therefore, of the first quality, be required to 
sustain the efforts of heroic poetry; yet as men of this cast are,
by a native impulse of the mind, engaged in such works, without waiting for imitation or inftrution; the effeCts they produce, although the most difficult, may be the first to attain their perfection, or at least high measures of excellence. Inferior capacity cannot be made to ascend so high by successive fleps; but the person, who is born to this elevation, finds himself placed at once on the height to which so few can aspire.

The scenery of heroic action is to be found in the rudest times;

in such times, danger is encountered with courage, friendship prefervecl with fidelity and ardent affection. Wrongs are resented with extreme animosity. If a genius be found that is fit to fcize

former examples to engage him in the relation of actions, or the ECAP.1 1-.
description of objects, already brought home to his feelings in the Y
examples of that life in which he himself is engaged.

The circumstances that may induce men to become poets or 
artifis of any other description, upon a lower pitch of conception or sentiment, and with the merit of corrednefs and elegance, rather thanthat of magnificence and elevation, may come afterwards,
and in the rear of many other arts, according as they are attended with the advantages that give to men of ingenuity leisure from the pressing cares of human life, and give to the people in general a relifli for the entertainments provided for minds otherwise vacant and unemployed.

Such circumstances we may conceive to arise from the diffinctions of rank and profeflion, which accompany a certain Rtate of the commercial arts; from the security which regular governments befow, and the other accompanyments of what are commonly termed the polite ages of mankind, charaCterized by mildness of manners, and abounding at once in the practice of commercial, literary, and imitative arts of every fort.

In estimating the attainments of such ages, we frequently think 
and talk in extremes. Whilit some have confidered the polite arts as the only appurtenances of human nature, for which it deserves to be valued; and have confidered what they term the polite ages, as the only periods that deserve to be known or recorded in history.

Others have confidered thofc infusions of invention and fancy as 
2 an 
PART I. an avocation from business, and a fedusion of the human mindc . from the care of itself, and the real attainments of virtue.


A late celebrated wit has enumerated four periods of history,

to which he would reftric the esteem of mankind: That of Alexander in Greece: That of Augustus at Rome: That of Leo the tenth; or of the Medicis in modern Italy; and that of Lewis the fourteenth in France. Then were the literary and imitative arts in the highest eiteem, and the most fruitful of productions inge.
nious, finiflhed, and correct ..

Such arts, however, were reprobated in the Roman republic to.

a very high period of its hiflory, as withdrawing the minds of youth from real affairs, and from the interests of state, to the sictions of mere imagination, and the refinements of fancy. It was,
indeed, natural to rate the scenes of Terence among the objecs of an idle hour, in the life of Scipio: Literature accordingly at Rome was reckoned a mere amusement or play; and, even in Greece,
the school of letters took the origin of its name from a supposed,
affinity to relaxation and idleness -.

The arts of decoration in general were excluded by the difcipline of Sparta; as tending to divert the mind from the care of preserving its own charaCter, in fortitude, magnanimity, and public spirit, to the study of fiivolous productions, that gave a lustre in the eye of superficial observers, but no way secured the foundations of private or public felicity. The poets, in particular, were excluded by Plato from his republic, bccaule they fiequently 
taught

The productions of human art may, no doubt, originate in any 
of the pafions, and partake in any of the characers incident to human nature. As they minister to convenience, ornament, and pleasure, in architecture, gardening, music, and manufacture of different kinds; so they minifler to admiration, in the fable of heroic poetry ; to grief in elegy ;to pity and terror, in tragedy; to indignation and ridicule, in satire and comedy; and to mere delight, or to any, or all of the former passions, in painting and sculpture. The ai ts of imagination, in Ihort, may be employed to conjure up an objecd,andrurnifh the occasion for any sentiment or emotion, whether honourable or vile. And we are 'surely not at liberty to extol or to depreciate such works, without attending to the charaAers they bear, and the effects they are likely to produce.

The topics from which Cicero extolled the productions of literary 
art; "That they fofler youth, delight old age.; adorn prosperity,
" give refuge and comfort in adversity; are pleasant at home, and "no hinderance-abroad; arecompany in the night andon the road,
" .in town and country ' ;" in flort that they take entire pof'session of the mind, were probably the very grounds upon which his predecessors, ofa feverer age, refused to admit them at Rome.
They were, indeed, likely to become an avocation from the business of slate, and it was thought idle to be amused with any imaginary subject, while there was a real country to be served, a real friend to be supported, or a real person in distress to be relieved or protedted.

of poetry in particular from a scheme of polity, in which virtue was proposed as the sole or principal object of the citizen; it is probable that the fine arts will ever make a partof the unrestrained progress of human nature. And that productions which at Sparta, and even at Rome during a certain period of its history, were supposed to be the fruits of weakness and corruption, will, by nations in general, be confidered as a topic of praise, and a principal ground of felf-efiimation.

In such applications of the human mind, indeed, either vice or 
virtue may predominate; and it is the objeCt of wisdom to give virtue the ascendant, not to stifle ingenuity merely because it may be abused. Its attainments make a part in the progress of Intelligence, and must finally tend to its bell direction, as well as to the enlargement of its force.

Knowledge, whether in the form of hifory or science, is surely 
of great value to the intellectual nature of man. And the records of knowledge, preserved in literary compositions, are the principal means of communicating its benefits from age to age, and from one nation to another. An art by which this effect is produced may, no doubt, be placed among the effecCtual means of cultivating the faculties of man; of forwarding his progress;
of extending the fruits of experience, and of augmenting the powers to be derived fiom a just notion and application of the laws by which human nature is governed.

It is not to be doubted, that the genius of Greece was routed 
and directed by the heroic strains of Homer, and of the dramatic poets, which were familiar to the people; and, whether retained in their memories, or represented on their theatres, made a principal part in the entertainments even of the vulgar.

It is not to be doubted, that one of the Scipios, without abating 
the masculine vigour of a Roman soldier, became the more accompliihed for his acquaintance with the literature of Greece,
that Octavius, by his intercourse with men of elegant talents,
and philosophical knowledge, from a cruel and perfidious adventurer in the pursuits of dominion, became a wife and beneficent mailer,, in regulating the affairs of a great empire.

The models of literary production to.be studied, may be such as 
tend to inspire humanity, justice, and elevation of mind ; but we are not, perhaps, to appreciate their effects solely by the degree of excellence they may have aCtually attained, in any particular instance. The attainments of genius or art may be yet at a low pitch; while the effort to raise or improve them; is that which carries forward the mind, not only in this, but in every other part of its progress.

In the course of his progress, even the error he commits, or the evil he incurs, stimulate his exertions and promote his advancement.
The objec at which he aims is good; and, though sometimes miftaken, human reason cannot finally acquiesce in what is found to be evil. A mistake perceived is thereby corrected, a known error is a ftep to the discernment of truth; such steps however interrupted or flow, lead, in the end, from ignorance to knowledge,
and from defelt, to the supply of that defed. Insomuch, that although mistakes niay be indefinitely multiplied, it is the tendency of experience to exhaust the fum of possible errrors, and to limit the choice at last to what is best.

In the progress of prosperous nations, every individual, having 
his object to pursue, bears a part in the active exertions by which the whole is advanced. The poet, the historian, or the fine artists of any description, are but few, compared to the numbers of a people; but there are none, whose apprehensions or thoughts communicate more effetually with the minds of their countrymen: Insomuch, that attainments of the fort we are now confidering, although they originate with a few, adually pervade the whole; become an article of the national character; are justly ranked with the materials of history; and furnish a test of what nations, long since extint, acually became in the result of their progress.

Of the Trogrefi of Moral Apprehension.

?ART I. MEN are deeply concerned to ascertain, and to apply the diL tingion of good and evil; and in this have a progress no less than 
i.'VN» in the pursuits of physical knowledge, or the practice of arts.

They improve in the detail of their judgements; and advance 
from the perception of right and wrong, in particular instances, to general conclusions, on the subjed of manners, law, religion, or the specific excellence competent to the nature of man; and, what is still of more consequence; in happy instances, advance in the habits of sobriety, humanity, and candour.

The diftincion of right and wrong is coeval with human nature: It is perceived without instruction, in ats of fidelity and beneficence, or of perfidy and malice. Ihefe are topics of praise and blame, in every nation and in every age. That, indeed,
which in one inflance is confidered as a benefit, in another inatance is confidered as harm or detriment. his difference of 

conception obtains in matters of much physical consequence, PART I.



even in matters of life and death. The Thracians of old assem- ScT.X
bled to weep and lament at the birth of a child; to rejoice and to triumph at the death of a friend. The superannuated American,
in the neighbourhood of Hudson's Bay, we are told, and will have farther occasion to observe, confiders death as a favour, and expecs it from the piety of his child, or his nearest of kin. The Gentoo widow desires to be burnt on the pile that consumes her husband's body. Injuries are no where estimated by the measure of mere physical harm; as the itroke of a flick is more resented by a gentleman, than the thrust of a sword.

On the maxims of former ages, in Europe, it was polite to harrafs a guest with ceremony. And, in Kamfchatka, at present,
hospitality requires that a guest ihould be so prefled'to eat, and the cottage in which he is received hliould be so over-heated with fire, that he is obliged to take to his heels; 'aid his sudden flight is the only test of his having met with a kind and honourable reception.

Such customs, indeed, are rather ridiculous than hurtful; but,

being incident chiefly to rude ages, may serve as examples of a defect to be supplied in the progress of moral apprehension and manners. As the object of benevolence is to confer benefits and to oblige; mere experience of external effets tends to correc mistakes in this matter, and leads to a better conception of what is conducive to the interest or convenience of human life.

In rude minds, the judgement of right and wrong is more dilturbcd by violent paflions, whether of partial attachment, jealousy, and cruel revenge, than by misapprehension or error: And 

PART I. nations, in different circumtfances, assume for principal topics of SHAp. I. praise or blame, characters and acions which happen to be favour'.-s->, able or adverse to their own pursuits or manner of life. In warlike nations or ages, valour is confidered as the principal conitituent of virtue, cowardice as the principal constituent of vice.
Among traders, punctuality and fair dealing is the standard of efiimation, and, in the cant language of merchants, a good man means a person that is solvent, and full able as well as willing to.
fulfil his engagements. In the language of connoifeurs and Dilettanti, Vertu means the study of antiquities and curiosities of nature and art. Valour was the ap(tT of the Greeks, and the Virtus of the early Romans.

But in whatever particular human nature admits of a deviation from truth, it admits also of a return to it in the progress of experience and better information. The tendency of this progrefs is to make the real welfare and peace offociety, founded in justice, the rule of propriety and estimation in all the external ations of men. And the advances which are made to this point may be collected from the laws, as well as the manners offucceffive ages.

Law in some inflances is an article of cuflom, and a part in 
the manners of the people to whom it relates. In other initances, it is the will of the powerful, requiring compliance on the part of the subject. And in conflitutions provided for the freedom of the people, it is the deliberate convention of parties, respeding the terms on which they are to live in society, and the securities they are to enjoy for their persons and property.

As the law of cuitom or practice mulf at first partake in the 
manners 
manners of a rude people, so it is likely to partake also in their PART I.
subsequent progress. The judicial combat; the ordeal, as a trial 
of innocence; or the torture, as a means of obtaining evidence of truth, made a part in the jurisprudence of our barbarous anceftors. But they have been discontinued also in the gradual progrefs of reason, without the interposition of any formal acs to repeal them.

Property in rude ages is scarcely diftinguified from mere pofsession; and the person who finds what is loft, thinks himself entitled to seize it for his own. But the common interest of all parties tends by degrees to suggest other maxims relating to this source of industry, and subjea of judicial discussion.

The will of the powerful, when unrestrained, is a source of 
mere partial regulation in favour of one party and againfi another. Thus the patrician laws at Rome were mere ads of violence against the plebeians; and the feudal constitutions in modern Europe were a system of usurpations, in behalf of the lord and against the vassal.

To purify the sources of legislation, it were fit that every partial interest flhould be excluded; or what is the nearest to this in effect, that every partial interest should be admitted to guard,
and to promote itself, as far as is consistent with the welfare of the whole ; that the magistrate should be admitted into the councils of legislation, in order to suggest and obtain such regulations as may be necessary to strengthen the sinews of government;
and to prevent filch acts, as under pretence of immunities, might tend to give licence to disorders and crimes. That the superior orders of the people should be admitted, to give itability to governI mcnt,

P.RT I. ment, and to guard the advantages of which they are themselves . fairly possessed: And that the promiscuous multitude should be $z ( T.XIIL.
-\j-N , admitted by themselves, or their representatives, to restrain any 
unfair advantages that might be taken of the diftin ions or powers established in favour of any part of the community.

When parties of every description are thus fairly consulted,

and accede to a6s of legislation, the result is, a fair convention;
and may bejuftly enforced by persons entrufled with power for this purpose. Legislature in this form is a continued negotiation,
in which the parties are employed to explain former articles, or deliberate on farther agreements for their common advantage or safety. And, in this train of proceeding, the lights of experience,
or the suggestion of successive conjunaures form a principle of progression on which mankind advance in civilization, good order, and justice.

The forms and tenets of religion, as well as manners and law,

originating in rude ages, may partake also in the subsequent progrefs of reason and moral discernment. The mind of man, firongly impressed with the diftintion of right and wrong, has cause to apprehend, that the fame power,- from whom this impression is derived, and who has inspired the preference that is given to justice, is himself engaged on that fide, and is disposed to reprobate what he has taught his creatures to detest and condemn,

Under this apprehension, there is reason to hope that the principles of morality should be ftriclly coqnae.ed with those of religion. The fai, however, in the history of rude minds, is confiderably different. Superffition is, the fear of harm and disorder from invisible powers. It is conneded with frivolous obfervances,

ces, incantation, and penance; even aAs of cruelty and malicious PART I.
effeCa towards mankind, rather than aas of beneficence and justice. SAr.IPII

Such it is among barbarous nations in general; and such it was 
even with the celebrated nations of Carthage and Rome. The former is known, in the ordinary practice of their superstition,
to have offered up human victims in sacrifice, with circumstances of extreme cruelty and horror. The other is recorded to have buried human creatures alive, to anticipate or elude the force of a pretended prediction: And the people, by authority of their augurs, and to appease an offended deity, were at times fubjeded to the most burdensome impositions; no less than oblation of all the increase of their herds or flocks for a season *: And, in some of the Italian hordes, this is said to have extended also to the children which were born in the fame period.

But the human mind, however low it may be found in its fuperftitious conceptions and habits, is not devoid ofrefources, by which to extricate and to raise itself. The knowledge of nature,
to which mankind aspire, may, in its progress, improve their conception of God, and at once reform their belief, and its application to practice.

The reform, indeed, of false notions once taken up, on the 
grounds of religion, is not to be looked for in the effecs of mere reason on the minds of ordinary men. These are engaged in their superstition by the horrors they feel, as well as by their habits of thinking, and require the impulse of an opposite doctrine, urged with similar passions, to have any considerable effect.

VoL. I. Qq Wild 
v This was termed the Vcr Sacrum.

PA.RT I. ' Wild systems of enthufiafin or superstition, accordingly, have  been required nmutually to supplant one another: Reafbn has ope'wrYvN rated only in the minds of a few. But the diftinclion of good 
and evil, which we are now confidering, which recurs in so many instances, and which is ever attended with the most vehement emotions of esteem and contempt, of love and hatred, is not likely to escape the refleCtions and inquiries of those who would dive into the principle of every natural or moral appearance, and who are qualified to distinguish reason from folly, and the strong impreilions ofjuftice and goodness from the feverifl passions of a superstitious mind, and who would fix their conceptions on a master of so much concern to mankind.

To know himself, and his place in the system of nature, is the specific lot and prerogative of man.

This prerogative, as far as it serves to distinguish him from 
the other animals, is a mere attribute of mind, and common to every individual poffefled of certain faculties. Hence, persons of the least reflecion are conscious of what they themselves think and intend, as well as apprized of what pafles in the world around them. They are conscious of merit and demerit, of innocence and guilt, oft just apprehension, of error and mistake; can enumerate, to a certain extent, their own faculties, difpofitions,and habits: But the proper use of this knowledge, in cultivating the subjeA to which it relates, in directing the choice, and in the acquifition of freedom or power over themselves, is limited to a few:
And, even to those, the pursuit of such knowledge, beyond what the immediate occasions of human life require, is not the first nor the prevailing objec of fludy.

On 
On the subjet of mind, we have observed, men are apt to mif- PART I.
take familiarity for knowledge; or think it idle to state for mat- ECHAr,'XI

.

ter of observation, that of which every one, in the very ad of thinking itself, is conscious. The very use of their intelligent faculties serves to carry their attention beyond themselves. Every perception has its object abroad. Every art is praaifed for some external end. Knowledge, though an attainment of mind,
for the most part, refers to some existence apart from the mind itself; and understanding, in all its applications, is, with the greatest number of men, an instrument of deliberation or execution relating to other fubjeAs ; not itself a material on which its own power may be exercised, and the advantage of some improvement obtained.

The first efforts of fludy, accordingly, in the pursuits offcience,

are directed to objects not only external, or separate from mind;
but even the most remote; such as the phenomena of the heavens, or the first origin of things on the earth.

Such were the pursuits of science, when Socrates is said to have 
brought down philosophy from the heavens; or, to have fubftituted, for conjecture relating to the origin of worlds,, the confideration of what man is more immediately concerned to know;
the distinction of excellence and defect, of good and evil, relative to his own nature, and the conduct of his own affairs.

The exterior forms of morality, indeed, in every nation, and 
in every age, are an interelting and a popular subjeC. They bring into view those diftin'tions of wisdom and folly, of benevolence and malice, on which the mind most willingly employs its powers of contemplation and judgement. The first compilers of 
QO q 2 moral 
PART I. moral duty, accordingly, no less than the supposed founders of  states, remained to subsequent ages the objects of great veneration;

^v»v and were easily conceived to have had communication with highly beneficent and supernatural powers. Such was the degree of consideration in which Confucius, Zoroaster, Mango Capack, and others of a similar descriptionwere held by their refpedtive nations.

The collection of moral precepts in rude ages is for the most 
part a ritual of external forms, in which men are diredted to restrain, their pafitons, and to counteract the effeds of their interest in behalf of their duty to other men. Virtue, in many instances being an effort of toil and of felf-denial, was supposed to need as well as to have a reward or compensation, in some way different from itself.

These conceptions, however, do not satisfy the inquisitive mind.

If virtue be 'a good, why not embrace it for itself ? If not a good,
why prompt the observance of it by considerations foreign to its nature ? These questions are easily answered, with refpedt to the distribution of rewards and punishments, in what concerns the peace or good order of civil society. The community rewards the dutiful, or punishes the disorderly, to induce every member to abilain from what is hurtful, and to do what is best for the comr munity; without confidering how far it is, in the nature of things,
best for himself.

But the philosopher, who would investigate the principles of 
choice for mankind, cannot recommend to the individual as an article ofwifdom, what is not good for himself as well as for.othcrs.

The 
The first great point to be fettled, therefore, in forming any PART 1I



system of morals, is the specific good competent to human nature, 
that in which the individual can moit benefit himfelfand his fel- k/v-'
low creatures.

It must be agreed, upon all hands, that, if this choice can be 
ascertained, men will have found the proper fiandard of eftimation and the rule of life. It makes or constitutes the virtue which it recommends, and it rewards the labour which it enjoins.

This was the obje& to which the conversations of Socrates were'

pointed; and they led in a few fubfeqiuent ages to a variety of systems, in which the authors attempted to lay the foundations of moral science on some general principle relating to the chief good or destination of man. They all agreed in making happiness to consift in the proper conduc of life; but forne would detach man from his fellow creatures and would have him decline the cares of a family, or any charge in public affairs. Others would have the individual to confider himself as a part in the community of mankind, happy in discharging the offices of a friend to his neighbour,
and in submitting to the will of providence in matters not placed in his own power.

The first schemes of moral wisdom, which were formed on 
these principles, having the advantage of novelty, drew attention not from the multitude alone, but fiom those also who were moit diftinguiflied in the higher ranks of life, statesmen, warriors, and kings. And before the multitudl of false or superficial pretenders began to discredit the profeflion of philosophy, a fair trial was made of its force, as the nursery of heroes and the school of nen.

FART I. " In point of fortune and common opinion," said Antigonus, in I his letter] to Zeno, " I may hold myself your superior; but, in 
/> ' " reason, discipline, and true happiness, know that you greatly 
" surpass me. For this reafon,-I now write, to intreat that you " will come to me; and hope that you will not refuse my request.
" By all means, then, haften to join me here; and be aflured, that "your inftrutions will be a benefit, not only to me, but to all "the Macedonians also. Whoever inspires the king with virtue " will do the fame to his people: For, such as the sovereign is,
"such, for the most part, is the subjea disposed to become*."

From the diftinguilhed names that appear in the history of 
philosophy, whether as inftruaors of mankind, or themselves as ctors in the great scenes of human life, such as Socrates, Plato,
Xenophon, Fpaminondas, Aristotle, Zeno, Cicero, Cato, Thrafea,
Helvidius, Epidetus, and Aurelius; we must conclude that the progreflion of human nature, in this matter, is not less confpicuous, than it is in the other particulars, in which we have attempted to trace its advancement.

It is observable, indeed, in this and in other articles of man's 
progress, that it is not always equable, nor exempt from interruption. Men continue for ages apparently or comparatively indifferent to science of any fort; and, even where the desire of knowledge is awake, particulars of small moment engross the attention to the exclusion of others more important. Physical ftudies are in fashion at one time, and morals are neglected. Even where the last may have their turn among the objets of fpeculative disquisition, they are treated more as anobjec of theory, thanof choice and command. To the speculative, even mind is a foreign

and the learned is busy for others, not for himself. Men of a- <<
spiring dispositions assea to be diftinguilhed from the vulgar,
and become indifferent even to the sublime principles of religion towards God, and charity towards men, if they are the common expressions on every tongue.

' he effe& ofphilofophy of old was no doubt in some meafire owing to the diffintion it gave. With this finppofed advantage, or the power it bestowed, philosophy was communicated from Greece to Rome. It formed in part the principle upon whicheminent men, in times ofthe republic, devotingthemfelves to the service oftheir fellow citizens, threw open their doors to such as had occasion to consult them on questions of equity or justice. And even under the emperors, it continued to bestow on numbers that freedom and elevation of mind, which the new form of government was otherwife likely to subdue. But the revolution, which overthrew the republic, did not reach the minds of those to whom the maxims and habits of philosophy had descended as an inheritance from their fathers. Whether promoted, as they Sometimes were, near to the highest steps of the throne, or proscribed and per'ecuted for a freedom of spirit which tyranny could not suppress; the power and preferment which did not corrupt, or the cruel oppression which could not debase, equally raised and Supported them in the esteem and confidence of their fellow citizens. They still devoted themselves to public.fervice. In their capacity of council in matters ofjuftiee and equity, their doors were open,
as in times of the republic, to all who wiihed to consult them.
I'ven the emperor Auguflus, deriving a new characder, from the philosophy to which he had recourse on his poffefion of the throne of Cefar, enjoined,by a formal cdil;, that the gratuitous anlfwers 
<).s*

PART I. of those philosophic counsellors flould be recorded in the courts SaP. III of law, and adopted as a part in the civil code. Antiftius Labeo,
*v and Atteius Capito, in whose favour this edic of the first emperor 
was publiflied, were followed by others, who enjoyed a like confideration in the- subsequent times of the empire. And from them chiefly is derived that system of jurisprudence, which fill advanced to maturity, amidst the decline of every other art or political eftablihment, in the empire of Rome.

The philosopher refts his choice of a part to be adted in human 
life, upon the consideration of what he himself by nature is; and,
upon the consideration of his situation or place in the order of things, he conceives himself as a part not in the community of mankind alone, but in the universe of God. " If I have done a " good office," fays the emperor Aurelius, "let me not forget that "' this itself is my good; and let me never cease to do such things."
In recognizing his flation, he does not limit his view to any parti- ular division of mankind; but confiders himself as a part in the great fyftern of nature, excellent in being fitted to his place, and happy in contributing to the general good. " Whatever is a"greeable to thee, shall also be agreeable to me, O beautiful order " of nature! Whatever thy seasons bring, shall be fruit, neither too "early nor too late for me." Such sentiments of a sublime religion, may be justly confidered as the highest attainment of created intelligence. Its foundations are laid in the genuine lessons whether of physical or moral science; and are to be met with in the concluding observations of Newton's Principia, no less than in the remains of Socrates or Epicetus, of of Marcus Aurelius.
In the one, it is the suggestion of final causes, or of an arrangement in the works of nature, for which mechanism alone will not account. In the other, it is the resort of minds devoted to 
the 
the government ofwifdom and the sentiments of benevolence, and PART I.
who receive, with some degree of a congenial spirit, the indicati- L
ons of supreme intelligence and goodness, as they are perceived jrYv to operate in the great system of the world.

Two things only are required, fays Epictetus, to raise the mind 
to ajut sense of divine providence,-attention tothecourfe of nature, and a grateful mind.

And thus, we may conclude, the highest point to which moral 
science conducs the mind of man, is that eminence of thought,
from which he can view himself as but a part in the community of living natures; by which he is in some measure let into the design of God, to combine all the parts together for the common benefit of all; and can state himself as a willing inifrument for this purpose, in what depends on his own will; and as a confcious instrument, at the disposal of providence, in matters which are out of his power.

It is thus we may conceive the principles of progression to subsift in human nature. As they are never suppressed, we should conceive them ever to operate, and should expet a continual advancement, in some one if not in all the pursuits and attainments we have mentioned: But human affairs are subjed to vicissitudes;
and the human species is observed to decline in Tome periods, no less than to advance in others.

Among the circumitances which lead in the progress or decline 
of nations, that of political situation may be justly reckoned among the first or most important. And in this the most favourable conjuncture is sometimes obtained, or the reverse is incurred,

VoI,. I. R r with 
PART I. with perfect blindness to the future, or ignorance of the con-ift Hquences which.are likely to follow. The parties wouldalways better 
'-t themselves: But they are often driving they know not whither.

Thus theBarons of England, in times of high feudal aristocracy, knew,
not that the charters, which they extorted from their sovereign, were to become foundations of freedom to the people over whom they themselves wished to tyrannize. No more did the Roman people foresee, that the support they gave to Coefar, in reducing the senate,
was in effect to establish a military despotism, under which they themselves were to forfeit all the advantages of a free nation.

The vicissitudes to which human affairs are exposed, are an esfential article in the scenery of an active life: They are fitted for the inftrudion of those who would profit by their situation and their faculties, or preserve those advantages of either fort, which the experience of mankind informs them may be forfeited by folly and neglect, no Iefs than obtained by wisdom and. virtue. And this discipline to which human nature is fubjateed, is not a rule of neceffitybut a recommendation to will and choice. Examples are presented to nations no less than to figle men. For both, the way is strewed with the effects of vice and folly, as well as those of virtue and wifdonm; so much that neither can complain they are bereft of direction to what they ought to chufe, or warning of what they ought to avoid. As the rock is covered with wrecks, so the fair channel-is open to those who would steer in safety.

When we fay that the Author of nature, has projected a scene 
of discipline and progrefilon for men; it is not meant to affirm any rate of actual attainment for this versatile being. The facuia tics are given to him, and the materials arc presented for his ufc:
But the effect is optional to him. We afccrtain the rule by 
which 
which mechanicaloperations proceed, and can predid, to a second, PART f.
when the fun or the moon shall be eclipsed, when Jupiter will be opposition, or Venus pass over the diflk of the fun. But we r cannot affirm what men will do in any cafe whatever. If the fame physical coniunaures return, the fame principle of caprice or choice in the mind of man returns also; and, in any given circumstances, the ac6or is sometimes inclined to vary his conduit,
merely because he would try a different one.

In alluding, therefore, to what mankind may have gained, we 
do not limit the view to what the 'ordinary race of men have accomplifhed; but rather look forward to that of which human nature in the best is susceptible. Let those who question the reality of that progress, which we suppose the human species to be making, compound the matter with others, who contend that man in his original slate was no more than a brute. This species indeed, however near at the outset to the ltate of mere animal nature, is carried, in the result, far beyond the concerns of this class,
and fteems prepared to penetrate with its views and aCtive exertions, beyond the limits of this terrestrial globe.

The sequel in this order of things is yet hid from our fight.

The life of a plant is come to an end, upon its separation from the foil on which it was destined to receive its nourishment, and terminates with the ftruaure of its parts. The existence of an animal may be naturally limited to the scene for which his organization and his inftinEts are provided: But intelligence has no specific place. It is a qualification to live, wherever the circumstances of the scene can be observed and understood. It is thus that man, while the other animals are limited to their different 
R r 2 climates 
PART I. climates and situations on the earth, is qualified to live on this E globe wherever he is placed, and wherever his faculties are fuffiSEcT.rXIII. .
nowv cient to direa him in what it is proper for him, in his refpedive 
place to chufe and to perform. How much farther he may ebe qualified to continue his existence, aind accommodate himself to new situations, is a question of conjeture which men have frequently agitated, and on which they have for the moRt part fondly adopted a decision in their own favour.

In refpe& to mortality man seems to be involved with the other 
animals. And the appearance at death is to him, as well as to them, a final extincion of every active power. But as he has views which reach far beyond theirs, so he has hopes also which.
extend far beyond the period of existence, in which they are made to partake with him. How far these hopes are probably grounded may be confidered in this place; the question seems naturally to arise, in the sequel of what has occurred on the fubje& of man's progreflive state, and his capacity of advancement: a capacity which is very real in the lowest specimens of his nature ; and no where exhausted even in the highests.

S E C T I 0 N XIV.

Of a Future State.

THE evils ofa prefentlifeare acknowledged, or exaggerated, and PART II
assumed as prognostics of a future state, in which these evils are 
to be done away or compensated. But a supposed derangement T
in the only scenes with which we are acquainted, is surely but an ill presage of better and happier scenes to be expected, under a,
continuation of the fame government.

It will be understood, that; in treating of this subjea, as of others that occurred in some of the preceding fedions, it is intended to explore the regions of conjecture, so far as they are open to mere reason, without any supernatural aid: And we must not be surprised if, in this attempt we meet with clouds, through which we cannot fee our way; and boundaries of knowledge, which our faculties are not fitted to pass. Nor ought we to be discouraged,
refpecing the fum of our condition in the system of nature, from the undecided appearance of things to come.. The future, even 

PART I. respecting the remainder of this animal life, is hid in obscurity;
CaAP. III. and, upon this ground, we take measures to fix our lot for the SEcT.XIVv aJ better; and, among impending uncertainties, would help on the 
events which we wish to obtain. The chance of life may be calculated for the infant at his birth, or for the adult at any year of his age; but, it is still no more than a chance, never a fixt nor a determinate period.

Of this uncertainty in the profpec of human life, the final 
cause is obvious: For, to a being whose activity is efiential to his own welfare, and to the order of nature, the profpe fihould ever be such as to admit and to flimulate his active exertions.
'The certainty of an impending end would check his enterprise,
or the certainty of a long period yet to come encourage his procraltination.

If the period of mere animal life be thus properly undefined,

we cannot justly complain that the profpea of future existence in a state of reparation from the' body should be also uncertain:
Or rather, we may conceive the will of Providence in this matter to be, that man should attend to his present task, and not susser himself to be diverted from it by prospects of futurity, towards which he can contribute nothing, betides the faithful and diligent performance of a part which is now assigned to him.
Hoc age * was, of old, the watch-word of religion, in the performance of its rites; and may justly be admitted as the watchword of human life, in the discharge of its duties: Insomuch,
that they who conceive the merits of men in the present state of existence, to consist in the continual anticipation of a future one;

or * Mind what you are about.

or who would have men to be employed, for the fake of futurity, PART .
in the performance of duties at present of no value, appear in this CTAP.III.
matter to miflake, or even to counteract the designs of Provi- {
vidence.

Mankind, nevertheless, are not by nature precluded from looking forward to a scene of existence beyond the grave. The ingenuity which penetrates the boundless regions of space, has looked into futurity also. And final as the appearance of death seems to be, refpeeing the extinction both of intelligent and of animal nature, mankind very generally, if not universally, hold their own deffination in this, as in other particulars, to be very different from that of the beafis that perijh : They have confidered feparation from the body, not as a termination of existence; but as an entry to a new scene, on which even the rudest minds have employed imagination, and in which the more elevated spirits conceived a return into the b6fom of that intelligent Power from whom their being is derived; or in which they conceived a continual approach to that perfecion, of which their own nature is susceptible. Socrates, to those who enquired how he would be interred, said, " As you please, if you can lay hold of me, and if " I do not escape you. My body, indeed, will remain with you,.
"to be disposed of as you fiall think fit."

To man, the proper fabjeAs of knowledge are the present or 
the pail: Yet, in tome inflances, the knowledge of these is a knowledge of the future also. Whoever knows an order of things that is eftablilhcd, or the description of a. thing that is durable,
knows the future reficcing such matters, together with the present and the pat. Every one fees that the revolving heavens will bring the fiamc appearances in time to come that they now do,

and 
PART I. and have done in time past. The tree that bore its blossoms in CEHAP. IIi the spring, and its fruit in the autumn, is expedted to resume the 
xPVW fame appearances, and repeat its gifts upon the return of the fame 
seasons.

The cause of foreknowledge, in every such cafe, is the previous 
uniformity of events, presumed to continue in times future, as in those that preceded; or the duration of a given nature, through all the periods in which its existence continues. So far, however,
foreknowledge is limited to matters in which the continuation is not interrupted ; for, wherever nature has accomplished a period,
and has not fliown any sequel, human sagacity, with refpet to such matters, mutt come to a close also.

Thus, and no farther, the uniform course of events, or the 
laws of nature, are sufficient data, from which to infer the future. But, even where this ground of foreknowledge may fail,
there is yet another, less secure perhaps of its foundation, but enabling us to carry our conjectures to a greater extent.

In works of intelligence, we conceive a design, and a manner of 
execution. And although the manner of execution may change;
yet, while the fame intelligent power continues to operate, we apprehend a continuance of the fame design. We infer the future from the past; and without a repetition of the fame e-.
vents, we lay our account with events direced to the fame purpose, though obtained in different circumstances, and by different means. It is thus we reason from the seen to the unseen, in the works of nature. There are animals of a different defcription from those we know; but, apprehending a design to accommodatc their forms to the circumstances in which they are pla2 ced.

ced; we presume that in different situations, although they have PART I.
not the fame form, they will be equally fitted to their place. SECTAxI
We presume that the plant, which grows in any remote part of the earth, is fitted to its foil and its climate; and the animal, to his element and manner of life; although both should differ from any thing we have hitherto known.

The design to create, and to preserve, of which we perceive 
the temporary effecs in matters that are perishing, we may apprehend to produce more lasting effets, or to be of indefinite continuance, in refpet to natures of a more permanent kind, or better fitted to last through indefinite periods of time.

Here no doubt, the evidence of futurity is less cogent than it 
is in the anticipation of what is known to result from an eftablilhed physical order of things. In reasoning from the purpose of intelligent beings, our conception of the design may be raflh,
or inadequate; our knowledge of the circumstances through which we suppose a scheme to be continued, is no doubt defective; and our inference must be drawn with a proper degree of diffidence and modesty: Yet this is a topic to which intelligent beings muff have recourse in mutually forecasting their refpedive ations. It is thus that we infer the future conduC of men, from our knowledge of the end to which their actions are usually direted. The uniformity, of which they are susceptible, is not a precise repetition of the fame acions; but the fame purpose continued through such a variety of action, as the difference of fituation may require.

In the sequel of this argument, as we experience a design to limit the exigtence of perishing combinations, we fllould appreVOL. I. S s end 
PART I. hend a design to preserve through unlimited periods, natures of CXAP.XII. which the essence is permanent, and qualified for indefinite va.
kra\ riety of situations. We conclude that the fame intelligent power,

which preserved the one, while the parts of which it was composed are fit to remain in their place, will preserve the other through corresponding periods of time.

From this topic, alone, it is that we are entitled to argue the 
duration of the human foul, after its reparation from the body;
insomuch, that philosophy must have been silent on this head,
until the hopes of immortality could be derived from religion,
or until the minds of men had formed some conception of the designs of Providence.

There is an argument in which we would infer a physical immortality of the foul, from its immateriality or indivisible essence;
but, notwithstanding the form of demonstration assumed in this argument, the hopes of immortality must reft, not upon the supposed independent existence of any created being whatever; but,
upon a more rational assumption, that a disposition in the Maker to create is also a disposition to preserve what is created; and that the energy of Eternal Power, in creating andpreferving, is the fame,

Agreeably to this assumption, annihilation is no where known 
in the system of nature. Modes of existence, that consist in the combination of parts, change by decomposition; and pass, by recomposition, into a repetition of the fame forms. Substance remains unaltered; and form is perpetuated in a series or succession of similar combinations.

The organization of matter and the species of organized bodies 
is 
is preserved; but the objed of preservation is a series, and a con- PART I
dnued fucceflion, not the perpetuity of any one individual. SEcT.XIV.
WithrefpeA tofuchbeings every life has an end, as well as a begin- iV
ing; and the fame hand that has composed the parts, and preserves the composition through a certain period, is also, at the expiration of that period, stretched forth to dissolve. So it fares with the generations of plants and animals: The species is preserved by continual succession of new generations; but the individual in each is destined to perish.

Such may be the form of preservation, also, provided for the 
universe of minds or created intelligence: But, if we may be allowed to employ our feeble conjectures on such arduous fubjets,'
there is such a difference between the existence of animated bodies and the existence of mind, as may lead us to apprehend a different treatment. This world, or place of reception for plants and animals,
is limited,in refpea to space, and the supply of subsistence; and it is limited, of course, in respeCt to the numbers it may at once receive; so much that, in a scene of continual creation, the death or removal of one generation, is not less necessary to the order of nature, than the birth and succession of another.

Without this removal of one generation, to make way for 
that which is to follow it, the kingdom of plants and animals would Coon be overtfocked. But, to mere intelligence, whose pretence does not occupy space; whose faculties are nourilhed by knowledge, in which indefinite numbers may partake, and not by the exhaustible supplies of food; to a being, whose strength consists in affections of the mind, which become the more intense for being communicated; to a being, whose excellence confilts in 'wisdom and goodness; there are no limits in the space required 
Ss 2 for 
PART I. for his reception, nor in the numbers that may subsist together;
SECi.XIV. Or rather, the multiplication of numbers but multiplies the ocvy~Br cafions on which the happiness of such a being is manifefRed, and 
extends its effecs.

The world of spirits, therefore, may increase for ever, or cannot be overstocked; and the design to preserve, which we infer from the will to create, may operate indefinitely, and find no end.

The human mind is observed to make progress in the present 
slate, and to lay the first courses of a building which is to consist of knowledge and intelligence. This is done by means of perceptions conveyed through animal sense: But, if this scaffolding which is observed to rot and decay, should be actually removed in the termination of animal life, it is not necessary that. the building should be discontinued: some other contrivance may be found,
enabling the fuperftruAure to rife far above any height to which the former mechanism, or material contrivance, could enable it to reach.

It has been observed, that the author of nature appears to delight in variety;. and we may now add, not merely in the variety of description, that may serve to distinguish quiescent natures;
but, in the variety of fieps, also, incident to the progress and continued existence of one and the fame being.

Such are the successive variations exhibited in every part of 
the vegetable, animal, and the intellectual kingdom. Among these, there are examples of progression coming, in one line or dirctionj to an end; but, renewed in a different one. The 
2 butterfly 
butterfly originates in a species of egg, which is deposited on the PART I.
leaf of a plant, from which the animal, after he is hatched, may 
derive his nourishment. He lives, at first, in the form a worm ,vor caterpillar. He enjoys the food, that is provided for him;
and, as far as we are qualified to observe, bears no prognofiic of any farther destination: But, having grown to. a certain dimension, he becomes refilefs in his place; and removes to tome place of retreat, in which he may repose, and end his life undiflurbed. He mounts to some height from the ground, and makes himself fast; while his animal funcions are suspended or apparently cease. In the mean time, he takes a new form; and, cased with an inflexible cruft, becomes what the naturalists have called an aurelia or chrysalis, without any power of local motion, or appearance of life.

But, to the changes which he has thus undergone, succeeds, in 
the proper season, a change still farther removed from his original state: He awakes from his torpid condition, breaks the cruft of the chrysalis, in which he was cared; is borne aloft upon wings variegated in the pride of most beautiful colours; and thus, from a reptile that crept on the ground, or devoured the grosser part of a leaf, on which he was hatched, he comes to perform all his movements in the air, and scarcely touches a plant, but to fuck from its flower the finest part of its juices; he sports in the fun,
and displays the activity of a new life, during the heat and the light of noon.

Such transitions are known in many others of the inse't or 
reptile tribes. The frog, for instance, in the firfi period of life is a tadpole, with the organization and the inftindt of a fish;
formed like that class in the order of nature, to hold his place 
in 
PART I. in the element of water; but, after a certain period, has elapsed .
SECA.XIV. in this state of existence, his form and his inftinas are changed;

Y the tail or fin of a fish is transformed into the foot of a reptile 
he escapes from the pond; becomes the tenant of a different element; and retains only so much of his original nature, as to be amphibious, and to return occasionally to the element in which he began to exist, and in which he is still qualified at times to remain.

What is the living order of nature throughout, but a continual 
fuccefion of one form to another, in the progress of her works ?
The stamina of every plant, and of every animal, are lodged in its ovum or feed; and the tallest oak in the forest is grown from the fibres, that were wrapt up in the hufkl of an acorn. In this condition, while the organic matter is at reft, during indefinite periods, it is endowed with a principle of life, which preserves its substance, and its fitness to assume the specific form of being,
to which it is destined. Without such a preservative, we fllould suppose that, like other corruptible matter, the feeds of plants Ihould putrify, decompose, and lose the specific itrudure of their parts. They are, nevertheless, known through indefinite periods of time, to retain their vegetative power, without its exertion; until placed in the circumstances that enable them to spring, they exhibit the efforts of nature, and assume their specific forms of vegetation and progress of growth.

To the seedling animal, there is a first period of life, in which 
the power of spontaneous motion is joined to sensibility, and to the perception of circumstances, which call for the efforts he is able to make, whether to obtain relief from inconvenience, or to enjoy an advantage. With the oviparous animal, this period passcs 
es in the film or ihell of an egg; with the viviparous, it pafles in PART I.
the womb of the parent. In this first period of life, there is a CHAP.IIL
progress of the embryo, or the foetus, not only in the mere Se;r growth or development of organs, but in their spontaneous exertions also. The heart, and the blood vessels, arenot only formed,
but enter upon their functions, with the most lively effects;
and the animal, at every limb, begins to pradife the movements which he is destined to make in future periods, and in a different state of his being.

If the human foetus were qualified to reason of his profpeds 
in the womb of his parent, as he afterwards may do in his range on this terrestrial globe, he might no doubt apprehend in the breach of his umbilical cord, and in his reparation from the womb,
a total extinction of life; for how could he suppose it to continue after his only supply of nourilhment from the vital flock of his parent had ceased. He might indeed observe many parts in his organization and frame which lhould seem to have no relation to his state in the womb. For what purpose, he might fay, this dut which leads from the mouth to the intestines ? Why these bones that, each apart, becomes hard and stiff; while they are separated from one another by so many flexures and joints? Why there jaws,
in particular, made to move upon hinges, and these germs of teeth which are pushing to be felt above the surface of the gums ? Why the ftomach,throughwhich nothing is madeto pas ? and thefefpungy lungs, so well fitted to drink up the fluids; but into which even the blood that passes every where else, is fcarcelypermitted to enter ?

To these queries, which the fcetus was neither qualified to 
make, nor to answer, we are now well apprized, the proper anfwer would be, The life, which you now enjoy, is but temporary'

PART I. porary; and these particulars, which now seem: to you to pre.
 pofterous, are a provision which nature has made for a future 
_j'v'r course of life, which you have to run, and in which their use 
and propriety will appear sufficiently evident.

Such were the. prognostics of a future destination, that might 
be collected from the state of the foetus; and similar prognostics,
of a destination frill future, may be colleced from present appearances in the life and condition of man.

In this condition of a mere animal, for what purpose observe 
the heavens ? or strive to penetrate appearances, with which the globe of the earth itself has no connection ? What concern has any mere animal of this globe with the ring of Saturn, or the belts of Jupiter? Whence this affietation of simplifying the complicated order of nature ? of mounting upwards, from these numberless individuals and specimens of being, to the ideas of species, of genera, and claiTes under which they are formed by supreme intelligence, and which can interest only such beings, as are diftined to pass through these to a near, and more near communication, with that power, by whom they are made? Why embarrass the faculties with mathematical or metaphysical abfiractions, while the animal is to be gratified only with the solid specimen of bodies, not with such ideal conceptions; whether of a point that has no parts, of a line that has no breadth, of a substance that has no qualities, of a quality apart from any subfiance; of a kind, confidered apart from any species; or of a species confidered apart from any individual ? May not such aberrations of thought appear as little fitted to this present state of an animal, as the provision of teeth, of stomach and inteRfines,
might have appeared to the fcetu; while, in the womb, he was

the umbilicalcord. Andmaynotappearances, myfteriousin thepre- SECT.XlV
sent scene, be cleared up in a similar way byapprehending a future .-ow state of existence; for which faculties though superfluous in the life of an animal are yet wifely provided, for the remaining course of a rational foul.

In this variety of being, we observe the gradation of excellence 
displayed on a scale of great extent. The parts rife above one another by flow and almost insensible steps. That man is placed at the top of this visible scale has never been questioned.
In his alliance with the animal kingdom, he is enabled to perceive the material system around him, to hold converse with those of his own species, and to observe, in the operations of nature, marks of intelligence which inexpressibly surpass the powers of man.
In this, while he derives knowledgefrom the fourceof perceptions,
inwhich he partakeswith the animals, heafpires to communication withanorderofbeinggreatly fuperiorto his own; In refpead to the animal part ofhis nature, he ismade to pass through certain variations similar to the changes which other animals undergo; and like them he is made to encounter, at different periods of his progress, an apparent termination of life: But, as he passes from the state of an embryo or a foetus to that of a breathing animal; as he palres from the state of an infant, through that of youth and manhood,
to old age; so may he pass, at the dissolution of his animal frame,
to a new state of intelligent being, furniihed with other organs of perception and other means of communication with minds like his own; while the steps of their common parent and Maker become still more and more obvious in that order of things,
through which they are destined to pass.

VOL. I. T t Thus,

PART I. Thus, it appears no violent stretch of imagination to conceive SCAPT.IV. the human foul, in its present state, as the embryo of a celestial v^rv~» spirit, not as a mere principle of animal life, to determine, or have 
its end, when that life ihall come to a close.

Man, as hath been observed in stating his place among the animals, partakes with them in the description of an organized material frame; in certain animal powers and inftinAs, which are necessary or conducive to his preservation or to his progress through the different stages of life. His inftinas, mean while,
diret him to the end, rather than the means he is to employ for the attainment of that end; these are left, in a great measure, to his own choice. Even the end he takes upon him in process of time to fele&; and, upon principles derived from theknowledge of himself and his situation, adoptsea plan of life, different from that which would result from any particular appetite, paflion,
or disposition of his nature; even of those, he takes upon him to judge, from the higher principle of intelligence; and rejecAs or conforms himself to their dicates, according as he thinks it proper for himself, and for the order of nature in which he is involved.

The animals are qualified, by their organization and their inftinas, for the particular element and the circumstance in which they are placed, and they are not fit for any other: But man, by his intelligent powers, is qualified for any scene, of which the circumstances may be observed, and in which the proprieties of condua may be understood.

There are limits set to the progress of his animal frame. }t is Itationary; it declines ; and is dissolved: But to this progress of 
intelligence,

intelligence, in ascending the scale of knowledge and of wisdom, PART I.
there are not any physical limits, short of the universe itself, SEC.a.XIIV
which the happy mind aspires to know, and to the order of which he would conform his will.

While, in this mixed nature of man, the animal is doomed to 
perish, the intellecual part may continue to live in immortal youth. Their connection, indeed, while it remains, implies a certain sympathy of the one with what assets the other. The body suffers under dejection of mind; and the mind languishes under disease of the body. This sympathy is observable in the decline of age, as well as in the occasional checks which health may receive, during the vigour of life; but its effects are not universal, nor keep pace with the decline of the animal frame, or approach to its dissolution. Many retain the faculties, at that period,
superior to any bodily infirmity; or rather, when the band that connedcs the foul with its animal frame is about to dissolve, seem to anticipate that serenity to which they are destined, upon entire Separation from this mass of the earth.

Examples of man's intelle&ual attainments, of which some have 
been mentioned in the preceding seCtions, may serve to fllew also how much farther he may advance, in continuing to extend the ranges of knowledge and of thought, and in gaining such acccfsion of wisdom and goodness, as may qualify him for higher scenes of existence. The objea assigned by Julian to Marcus Aurelius ' was not any vulgar flight of ambition, like that of Alexander or Caesar, to surpass or to command mankind, but imitation and resemblance of the supreme God; and he attained to a 
T t 2 species * Vide Cxfars of the emperor Julian.

PART I. species of godlike eminence, which qualified him for a much higher . scene of existence, than that of the empire over which he presided.
SEcTr.IV.

From such examples we may presume to hope, that the Almighty power which preserves the animal, until the attainable ends of the animal life are obtained, will also preserve this intelligent being to make those attainments of which it is susceptible, to which it aspires, and in which it is adtually far advanced.

This argument, however, may seem to halt with refped to those 
who have made no such use of their faculties; with refped to those who are cut short even in the progress of animal life; with refpea to those who periSh soon after their birth, or at an early period; or those who live to employ their talents, as the inftinCs of a brute are employed, for mere animal purposes; and with refpe& to those more especially, who become more brutish and felfilh as they advance in years. In refpet to such inflances, we must confers, that there must bejuft apprehensions of future punifhment, not of reward, and doubts of their being deffined to raise a fuperftruaure, of which they have not laid a foundation: These are not fitted to supply the flock of celestial spirits;
nor is it contrary to the analogy of nature,, in the course of things with which we are acquainted, to suppose that, while such as become qualified for higher scenes of existence are conduded thither,
the unqualified will miscarry; and such as are debated, more especially, may fink in the scale of being, or aAually perish.

The maturity of its species is not gained by every plant that 
springs from its feed; nor is every feed destined to find a situation in which it may spring. The flock of every species,.
indeed, is kept up by nature, with a seemingly anxious care;

but 
but this end is secured, not by a penurious saving of the resources PART .
provided, but by such a profusion of the supply, as admits of 

SEcT.XlV.

apparent waste, without any danger of failure in the end proposed. This apparent waste may proceed from the collision of different natures, comprised in the fame system, and from the subferviency of one order of being to another, and of every order of being to the whole. Every plant hath its feed; and means are provided for its dispersion, and the propagation of the species.
In one instance, the feed, like that of the thistle, is fitted with a wing or a fail; is wafted in the winds; and distributed far and near, on the surface of the land. In other instances, a grain or a fruit being destined to nourish the fowls of the air, or thebeats of the field, quantities areremoved by them from the parent ftem; and the surplus of what they consume is left to spring from the foil, and becomes a supply to the flock of the species : In other instances;
the feed is shot from its place by the elastic spring of a pod, in which it was ripened: But notwithftandingthis feeminglyanxious care in nature for the propagation of feeds, the earth is not every where prepared to receive them: Part falls on the waters, on the barren rock that is deffitute of foil, or on the high ways,. on which they are trod under foot.

It sufficient for the purpose of nature, that the provision is fitted 
to accommodate the species, and to fupplyother wants that enterinto the system of her works. It may also. be fuifficient for the purpose of nature, respecting the population of the intellectual worlds,
that the supply is adequate, although many individuals, that seem to enter on the course which leads to higher scenes of being, have tfopped flort, or perished on the way.
In the mean time, however we may sport with such visionary 
conjecAures 
PART. I. conjecures, there is reason to conclude that the future, for whomSHAP.. iI. soever it may be reserved, will be fitted to moral agents; and,
kOv like the, present, be a state of rewards and punishments. Even 
the reward of immortality, conceived as a diftintion in favour of those who, by wisdom and goodness, qualify themselves for future and higher scenes ofexiftence, may be thought a worthy object of ambition, for the moit elevated order of created being, who have conceived the use of their own faculties, their descent from almighty God, and their relation to the universe, of which he has made them a part.

Such hopes have ever accompanied or sprung up in the human 
mind from the germ of religion. They are mentioned now as resulting from the present appearance of things, and as conjectures founded on faa; and not as a necefTary part in the present fyitem of moral government to influence the practice of virtuous men. Happiness is to be valued more for the present, than for the future; and, to determine our choice of what is good, we need not be told of any effect it will have in any other period of time:
For who would negleCt his health for to-day, although he should not look forward to its use for to-morrow.

The profped of a continued existence for himfelfis not neceiary to give tothe ingenuous mind an interest in the continuance of this beautiful order of nature. Men are delighted in hearing of happy scenes that now pass in distant parts of the world, in reading of scenes that passed many ages ago. To there they are not present any more than to the scenes which are to pass hereafter and, if that to which they are not present;
even that which past, while they had no existence, can delight them; why not that also of which they have assurance in future 
ture periods of time. The fame wisdom and goodness, which PART I.
now reign in the fyitem of nature will continue to reign. This 
fun will rife and run his course; these seasons will succeed one SECTXIV
another; the earth will be stocked with plants and animals;
man will have scope for his intellectual and moral faculties; and,
profiting by the experience of ages to come, may exhibit in tome future time, a felicity of which these infant generations of men are not yet susceptible.

The past, the present, and the future, are but as one object to the 
supreme intelligence of God, why not also to the created mind,
so far as it is qualified to partake in this. view of things, and can delight in contemplating the effets of eternal beneficence, whether past, present, or to come ? In this contemplation, not the present point alone, but that eternity, in which wisdom and goodness prefides, is embraced by the ingenuous mind and the joy which he now feels upon this apprehension is as much his own, as the delight which he takes in recollecting the past, or in perceiving any present scene of felicity, to which he is a witness. If he should himself be withdrawn from the feene, he rejoices to think that this beautiful orderof nature will not change, nor be any way the worse for his abience.

On this fubjecq, a gentleman being afkzed his opinion, put, in 
return, the following questions ; of which the discussion will be grateful to those who delight in views of religion and its operation on minds of a generous and noble nature.

QuefL. I. " Is it not true, that the molt part of men (persuaded ' even of the existence of another world, where they fiould live eternally happy in the greatest perfection of virtue, without any " weakness,) would be very glad after death, to forget their pailt 
" life 
PART I. a life, rather than to retain the memory of so many follies, so mascr.P V. " ny absurdities, and so many bad proceedings, of which the re"membrance could not but affect them, or certainly not give " them any contentment? I believe that then they would drink 
a draught of the water of the river Lethe, to forget the pait.

I. " Butif anyone have not remembrance of the past, is it not,

<' as if he were newly created, with refped to himself; and, rela" tive to his first state, is it not the fame thing as a perfed mortaa lity or intire annihilation ?

" If these two questions are to be answered in the affirmative,
the immortality of the foul is not a thing desirable for the most "part of men; even on the supposition the most favourable for 
them; that is to fay, that there were not any hell nor any punifhment for their crimes.

",Farther, with refpet to the profpe& of immortality let us c cfider men, the moif perfecly virtuous, having neither hopes " n fears; but living always with gratitude towards God, and " submitting always to his will, in those things which do not " depend on themselves, and passing all their life in aCions of 
goodness, and of well-wifhing towards men, with a mind pure,
satisfied, and benevolent.

" Marcus Aurelius the emperor, amongst others, passed his 
" life according to there principles, as much as human weakness "could permit. A man like him could not have reason, after "his death, to ask to forget his past actions. But a man like " him is incapable of having the least uneasiness about the im'; mortality of the foul. Let us fee what he fays of himself on 
" this 
" this subjed:--" Whence is it, he supposes to be asked, that the PAr.T 1.

" such love to mankind, flould have neglected this one particular,

" namely, that some of the belt men, who have as it were car" ried on a continual intercourse, and, by many pious and religious offices, been admitted to a 'familiarity with the Divine Being, should yet, when they die, have no longer any exist" ence, but be entirely annihilated and extinguished.

" Now, if this be really the cafe, you may be assured that if 
"it ought to have been otherwise, the Gods would have made "it so. For, if it had been just, it would have been prari" cable; and, had it been according to nature, nature would have "brought it topafs. Now, that it is not so (if really it is not) you " may be assured of this, that it was not advifeable that it flould " be so.!

" You fee that,in this disquisition, you are debating a matterof 
"justice with the gods; but we fllould not dare to dispute about " the goodness and justice of the gods, if we were not convinced " that they are possessed of those perfections: And, if they are,
"they undoubtedly would notbe guilty of this neglect, nor admit " of any thing unjust or unreasonable, in their administration of " the world `."

" In this palfage, we fee a divinity of chara6ter, how un" like the other rabble of us, who arealways thinking of futurity,
"and of things which we do not poflefs; whilst we should only " be occupied in pafling the adual moments, which God grants

" The more we examine the universe, the more we find every c thing to be governed by general laws, the most beneficial to the " whole, in millions of cafes, as far as we can comprehend. In " the cafe of man, and all the animals, the good of every indi" vidual is not separately consulted, but the good of the species of " every kind is at the fame time provided for; and if it were o"therwife, there could be no general laws by which men or " beasts could regulate the actions.

"It is singular, that men should have less confidence in God,

"than they have in a common acquaintance. If a person ihould "be asked to go to the country house of an acquaintance, in a small " island at tome distance from the ihore, where nothing could be " had but in that house; could he, after pafling one day, enter" tained agreeably in every refpe&, have the least doubt of his "being equally well treated the following days, or have the small"eft anxiety on the fubje ? How comes it to be poflible that "we Ihould have less confidence in God than in men ? And that " at death we fliould have the least fear of futurity, or the least "anxiety about what is to become of us?"
