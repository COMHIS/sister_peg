OF PERFECTION AND HAPPINESS 
Separately and conjointly considered. The Effect of Happiness.1 to 4.
What is supposed to be Happiness; in the enjoyment of Health, Equanimity, conscious safety,
and the occupations of a well regulated Mind. 4 to 6.
Happiness variously pursued; the chief end of our Being. The Happiness of Man consulted
in the formation of his Corporeal and Mental Faculties. His superiority to other Animals. 6
to 8.
The continual exercise of his Faculties necessary to his Happiness. The difference in what
consists the pleasures of a worthy and vicious mind. 8 to 14.
The employment of the mind in useful attainments and active Benevolence, necessary to
Respectability and Happiness in Life; to which end present ease must be sacrificed to future
attainments instanced in the labours of the Student and Schollar. 14 to 22.
Man, to be Happy, must be Wise, Intrepid, Benevolent, and Temperate; relying on the Wisdom and Goodness of his Maker, lives Happy in this World, and meets Death with Fortitude
and Hope. 22 to the End.
When different Terms have Place in Language it may be Supposed that
they stand for different or at least the same thing under different Aspects.
Happiness refers to Ease or enjoyment. Perfection to Excellence or matter of Estimation & merit.
So far they may coincide in the same thing under different Aspects, and
as they are  severally Supreme Objects of desire it is consonant to the
order of Nature to suppo them perfectly consistent if not one & the same
thing.
Happiness is appropriate to Sensitive if not mly to intelligent
B.
Perfection is a kind of Figure applyed even to inanimate or merely material Forms when they bear the marks of Intelligen design or are
Subservient to any valuable purpose of Intelligent .
Thus a Building is perfect when it exhibits an Admira Plan and 
Sufficient Workmanship, but in both it is the excellence of mind that
appears in the construction of the work.
Mind or Intelligenc is perfect or imperfect in itself: but mere Corporeal Forms as they cary indications of perfect or imperfect Intelligence.
Happiness in Created Being is the State of highest Enjoyment and least
Suffering 1 applied to Being in its whole exte. 2
Present Enjoyment that bring an over-ballance of Suffering here after
are not happiness & Sufferings that bring an over-ballance of Enjoyment
are not misery.
 These observations have no reference to that Happiness which is Eternal and umixed. But in the mixed State of Created progressive Being are
highly important.
To the Happy Man The past is matter of agreeable recollection not of
regret.
The present is not matter of Suffering but of Satisfaction & Joy.
The future is not matter of Fear but Confidence & Hope.
When past umerit Suffering as well as Innocence and Beneficence
are ma of agreeable recollection. Insomuch that is happy to have been
excellent  deserving or Perfect in the past.
In the present not Animal pleasu without measure or distinction:
but Health & its preservatives or functions are at once the preferable Enjoyments as well as perfection of animal Life.
Exemption from Malice or Fear in every Form or degree & the Contrary
Sentiment of Benevolence & Fortitude. The occupations of a Well
employed mind constitute the state of best
enjoyment, least Suffering and greate Perfection or Merit.
Conscious Safety is the great constituent of  Happiness respecting the
Future; But he who owes all to his own Resolution and determined mind 3
is therefore Safe.
These are at once the Perfections of Human Nature its highest and most
Secure enjoyments.
Thus the votaries of Pleasure 4 Virtue Elevation and Happiness 5 although
They Appear to divert and diverge for a time actually converge and meet in
a point at Least. 6
And the Creator in laying a Scheme of Progression 7 for man towards the
Perfection of his Intellectual  Being has at the Same time projected his
Happiness As the end of Creation.
The Animal System is beautyfully formd in respect to man in particular.
Besides the organization of his Body, his Instincts and Sensations bear the
marks of Divine Wisdom and obvious even to himself. They tend to his
preservation & wellbeing but not so unerring as the Instincts and Sensations of the Other Animals do in respect to them. Man having more
Intelligence  is left to his own Government. His Happiness or Misery is
in part deriv’d from this Source: but not in the degree in which he enjoys or
suffers as an animal: but in the degree in which he acquits himself properly
of his charge as an Intellectual and Moral Agent.
The Wise & courageous does  sink under animal sufferings nor forget himself in the midst of Animal enjoyments. 8 His happiness requires
that he should be superior to either and his Perfection is evidently placed
upon a higher Scale: The Contemplation The Affections The occupations
of a Powerful and  Intelligent Being. The animal instints and pleasures direct or allure him to the Animal Funons of Life & Safety.
Pursued beyond this purpose they tend to disgust or disease.
Pain has a Similar correspondence with respect to the ills to be removed
from animal Life.
Happiness or Misery depends on the good or ill us of a life that is preserved in the result of its Instincts or Senses; Mind is enlargd and gratifyed
in its discoveries & Contemplations. The Order of Nature as it is displayed
in the Ends and means  of Eternal Wisdom is Supremely gratifying as
matter of contemplation merely as well as a pledge of Benefice in that Power
on whom we depend for Existence. 9
Benevolent and Candid affections constitute the Specific perfection &
Felicity of designing and Intelligent Natures in all respects the reverse of
Malice, Envy or Jealousy.
The human mind being in its progress is yet incapable of uninterrupted
Enjoyment: but ingenuous & beneficent occupation is the most continued
Satisfaction  of which it is Susceptible.
From these considerations also we repeat our conclusion.
That the perfection and happi of mankind  same. e10
A mere Animal may have all the happiness of which he is susceptible in a
continued exemption from pain & in a succession of pleasing sensations:
But an Intelligent Being to be happy must be conscious of his State how
constituted & how secured. With him it is a principal consideration what he
himself is not merely what he feels. If he  knows himself to be mean or
unworthy the Sense of pleasure sickens & gives way to self abasement
Shame or Remorse.
A series of pleasures that would Suspend all the faculties of the mind
would change Man into a Brute & terminate in misery.
Such a State with a seeming indifference to Right or Wrong Honour or
dishonour appears to be projected in the term of Indiscriminate Pleasure
for the Chief good 11 or Ultima Object or pursuit. When however in
descending to particulars the term is limited to pleasure Safe & Worthy 
of the Mind The Votaries of Pleasure 12 seem to differ from  of Virtue
only in Words. 13 And if Words were of no Consequence, Such Sectaries
would not differ at all. But Words are often Ambiguous untill they are
explained, and few take the trouble to explain them & give way to their first
impressions.
In the Judgement of Hercules, 14 Virtu that is to say Worthy Attainment of Wisdom & Goodness Temperance Constancy & Fortitude Are
figured on the Summit of a  Hill 15 where real pleasure is also placed:
but there are such pleasures at the bottom that the Person who deliberates
below is in danger of remaining where he is instead of attempting the
Ascent to come at what he may with less trouble.
Της δ’αρετης ιδροσα 16 a man must Sweat to have the pleasure of Virtue.
But sloth assumes the Aspect of Relaxation & Ease.
Observe then the mixed Scene of human . The more frequent occasions which are given to Active exertion 17 than to passive Enjoyment the
Sufferings  and inconveniences which are to be avoided and confess
that even in those Instances and even more than in any Other the Goodness
of God towards Man is conspicuous.
In Many Cases indeed present Enjoyment or Ease is Sacrificed to future
Attainment And the Pupil of Nature like the School boy on his form
labours that he may lay the foundation of manly attainments & become
qualified for his part in human Life.
If Labour & pain are not to be endured for the  Sake of mental or
intellectual accomplishments why does the tender Parent instead of sending
his Child where he may be indulged where he may be pampered with
Sweets sends him into Confinement & Restraint where under the lash of a
Demagogue he is forced to forgo his Pleasures or look for them only after
having finished his task. 18
Few Parents are so Supine as to shrink from policy in the treatment of
their Children yet the Analogous Policy of Nature is admitted as an objection  to the Doctrine of Divine Goodness or Wisdom and The
happiness of the Creature we are sometimes told is not the End of Creation.
But it is manifest even to human Reason that there can be no end but the
diffusion of Good to the Energies of Eternal Power unchangeably Perfect &
Happy. 19
And the present mixed Scheme of human Life as it Suits our best conception of Wisdom & Goodness in the Author: So it bears the Aspect of a
Scheme but now  begun & likely to continue indefinitely.
The progress from Infancy to Age is sum of where Men in general are
destined to make in this Life if a Few exhibit much greater Attainments
than Manhood alone implys their Example but shows that the human
Capacity is far from being exhausted in the present Scene.
This Nature in its lowest Specimens may yet extricate itself And in the
highest may have made out a step towards somewhat higher. And the sudden break in  a progress so fairly begun & yet so far short of the point to
which it is directed tho’ in any scheme defect in the presumption that the
break is merely Apparent & but a transition from one period to another or
more in which the Scheme of progression will be continued to its consummation or end.
In thus sounding the depths of Futurity we no doubt may soon get
beyond the length of our Life  but in a Being  whom The maker has
Manifested himself in the order of his works 20 who can look so far beyond
his own position as to measure the very Globe on the Surface of which he is
but an attom number the Planets of which this Globe is but one delineate
their Courses round a fountain of Light & of heat so essential to the Living
worlds arround him himself so abundant and So great as far to exceed in
dimension the sum of all the Planets that  perform their movements in
orbits prescribed and as held by a line at distances which they vary but
within limits which they can neither contract to exceed: a Being to whose
imagination every fixed Star is a Sun And The Galaxy but the faint gleam of
numberless Suns planted in that direction through infinite Space & made
Sensible by a tinge of united light tho not individually perceived. In such a
Being The  future may be thrown open to conjecture as the present is to
his Investigation and measurement.
To the Herd which looks not beyond the Field on  they pasture
the duration of Being may not exceed that of the frame which their organs
Serve to compose but to a Being whose field of Contemplation is the universe itself The Tenure of Existence may extend like that of the Universe
itself. While he rests every hope or conjecture On The Assumed Justice
Wisdom & Goodness of Almighty God he cannot Err or mistake the 
present Course  it becomes old.
The very darkness of Futurity is to him an intimation that his bussiness
is now before him 21 and can receive no direction from a futurity of which
his information is yet so imperfect.
To be happy now he must be Wise Intrepid Benevolent & Temperate.
And till his Essence change from Intelligence to some other form these are
the Constituents of Happiness of Excellence Perfection and Beauty. The
Period of Being is not his own.  To be in the next impending moment is
as much at the Will of his Maker As the first Act of Respiration that took
possession of the life he was to lead on his dismission from the Parents
Womb.
If when this Respiration ceases he be worthy of Admission to an higher
Scene if his Nature be Susceptible of farther Existence he may hope &
rejoice in the prospect: but if it cannot be who can repine that the order of
nature is observed in his case as well as in that of every other Being.
 If a voluntary Sacrifice were required to the order of such a System
who that perceives that order could be reluctant in performing it.
Or what can be a more real occasion of Joy on any Event than to know
that it comes from the destination of Supreme Wisdom Goodness &
Almighty Power.
Under Such Government it is joyous to live & it is a Triumph to Die.

II. WHAT MAY BE AFFIRMED OR
APPREHENDED OF THE SUPREME
CREATIVE BEING 
That He acts from Design, and means to obtain an End. The irresistible evidence of a First
Cause and Creative Being in the Beauty, diversity, yet regularity, and analogy preserved in
things the most different. Happiness the End of our Being. Mere Enjoyment do not constitute Happiness. 1 to 3.
The contemplation of God’s works lifts the mind up to the Creator and disposes Man to Acts
of affection and good will towards his Fellow-Creatures, the true means of Happiness. Free
Agency. The various forms of Created things as affording pleasure, tend to make man
Happy. 3 to 7.
The Superiority of man over other Animals in being endowed with a reasonable Soul; which
enables him to look forward to another and better World, to be an Inhabitant perhaps of
another System. 7 to 9.
1st That he Acts from Design 1 & means to obtain an End.
This the Organic Form of Nascent Being to begin continue and preserve itself 2 is irresistible Evidence.
2d As this order of things bears the Stamp of Intelligence: 3 are there not
other Characters on the Face of Created things that lead to the apprehension of Corresponding attributes in the Creative Powers?
Does the Indefinite Variety 4 of Created Being 5 argue a diversity &
Multiplicity of Creative Powers? 6
Or is this apprehension Sufficiently Checked & the Identity of the Creative Power throughout the Whole sufficiently evinced by the Identity of
multiplied Forms and by the Analogy presented in things the most
different.
If so is Diversification to be apprehended as a primary Object or End of
Creative Design.
In our minds no end appears worthy of Creative design but Happiness
and this the most Perfect of which Created Nature is susceptible and this
would exclude Variety as a primary object. For Perfect Happiness though it
may be realized in multiplied Instances must be a repetition of the same
Identical Form and this Form  Consciousness  or Intellectual Power
in the high measure to which Creation is competent.
To perfect Happiness mere Enjoyment even Conscious Enjoyment does
not appear sufficient. Consciousness of Power also to be and to remain in
possession appears Necessary to Consummate Happiness.
The Supreme Being is of himself & by his own Power Supremely Perfect
& happy.
Created Perfection & happiness requires as much of this security as can
be infused into Created Being.
He must apprehend a Cause of that Existence of which he is conscious
and therefore depending for Continuance upon that Cause: but while he
exists he may be Conscious of having distinguished And preferred the Good
of which he is possessed & therefor may be conscious of it as his own and
as secure as the will to chuse the Good in preference to Evil. A Security
which if the Choice is exempt from Error never can be shaken.
Man cannot be the Conscious Author of his own Existence. But conscious of this Existence he may be the Conscious Author of what he
acquires by Experience Observation and the diligent use of his Faculties.
 He may be conscious of having entertained and of having discoverd
& corrected an Error of having found how delightful it is to know and comprehend the Works of God 7 to live with his fellow Creatures in habits or
affections of Good Will & Candour he may be conscious of a Will fixed in
the Choice of Happiness because he has discern’d it.
May nothing then open our Eyes and give sight of the final Cause 8 in
that Progressive Form of Being assigned to man and from continued by
continued by Analogy every other living form  this terrestrial Scene.
And is not Progression the most perfect Form of  Created Being
is susceptible. Tho to us who measure all by Time seemingly late & tardy in
Attainments yet to the Eternal Now simultaneous & at once Compleat. In
every passing  deriving Excellence & Beauty from its Destiny if
not from what it is.
So much is implyed in the Character of free Agency 9 in the Blame which
accompanys miscariage And in the merit which is acknowledged  in
worthy attainments and just performances and in the relaxation of mere
Instinct by which Animals are precisely Conducted. There is no climate to
which he is exclusively attached 10 No Species of Food whether Animal or
Vegetable Substance of which he is not free to Avail himself. He is a trader
in all commodities And an Artist in the Use of all Materials. Nature has presented the occasions And opportunitys of Action of Inquiry research &
discovery but left him to find his Way & take his Measures.
The Scene f11 is in every department wonderfully fitted to him. The
steddy form of Nature and its invariable Laws assuring the observer of what
he may expect & rely on in every Instance.
The means by which Events may be obtained The Indefinite Variety of
Still Material of Organised Nature Furnishing Subject of Contemplation
Comparison Analogy & Variety so well Suited as provision for the Nascent
search  Imagination and Arrangement constituting method & Comprehension in  this first Period extending Knowledge.
The Indefinite Variety of Created Being seems to exhibit Variety at first
Sight as a Primary Object of Creative Power. 12 But as Variety merely as such
does not constitute Happiness it cannot be supposed in itself an ultimate or
primary end of Creation. But as Being without Intelligence or Life is merely
subservient to the Living & Intelligent we may look for the final Cause of
Variety among the rest in this Subserviency to the use of mind.
Aristotle 13 had great merit in tracing the mode of human knowledge to
the Form & Distribution of things in which he is concerned as designing
and Active Power. In this Capacity his Bussiness with Individuals: But his
Knowledge of Order Classes Genera and Species prepares him to encounter
the Already known to him all to any peculiarity or accidents which it
behoves him to Observe.
And as I apprehend that material or mere passive Being have no other
Value than as they are Subservient to the Being and Progress of Mind I
think  this variety displayed to man is not itself an Ultimate End of Creative Power or Invention but a mere School of Intelligen and mental
Exercise to Man to whose beginning  Progress this Scene is Subservient: and in this point of View the Final Cause 14 of the Systematick Variety
of Things is discernible by us in the same manner as the Final Cause is discovered in the Construction of the Eye & Ear or the distribution of the
Joints & Muscles. 15
If the System of Terrestrial Nature be thus Accommodated to favour &
Urge the progressive Nature of Man What shall we say of that which is to
him the most important of Arrangements relating to him That he has not
every where to tread among his Inferior of in a still greater Department of
his affairs to cooperate or Contend with his Equals. This indeed is the Scene
in which if not his greatest honours are won his progressive Nature receives
the greatest impulse.
How Earth came to be  peopled The People cannot tell: For the first
man knew less than the last who has Parish Record for his Birth.
The Earth is now a System what it was before its Parts assembled who
can tell. Man begins an Infant on his Parents Breast 16 and here for him the
System terminates. He has no wish to widen it But the Family press
arround he is himself but one but much concerned for all. The Neighbours
too The Town the State itself become concerns of his. Tis well if he overlooks farther. The stranger may move his Wonder or his Pity. But thus
Humanity begins to bud beyond the seedling leaf. This living scene may
not be too much for him to grasp in its Prospective order. Perhaps he may
hereafter be entrustd with the Conduct of a Planet. When master of that
Jack a Solar System might not be too much. The Zodiac in the sequel with
all the Spheres of Night are but his Path to that Great scene the Universe
And this but leads him to  behold the Source of Being in respect of
which all he had seen is but slight Emanation or a taper lost to Vision in the
Blaze of Day.
It is common to man with the other Orders of Being in this Scene of his
Nascent Existence to make Part in a System to the End or object of which
his Powers & Energies contribute but it is peculiar to him in this Terrestrial
System to be conscious of his Part to Embrace it with a Willing mind &
even to carry his Views beyond it to a Source of Order & Beneficence to the
Extent of which he can apprehend no bounds or limits. So much is implyd
in that Distinction peculiar to man That while Other Animals perceive
their Lot in Being he alone attempts to trace from whence it comes. k
In this direction his efforts may be Feeble & of small success. But Ignorance perceived is the beginning of Knowledge 17 and the Collision of
Errors 18 may point to the Truth and the progress of Knowledge extending
far beyond the limits of a Present or any Actual scene may correspond to the
Infinity of its objects.
May we not thus  consider the first Germ of Region in the human
Soul as a pledge of its duration beyond the Limits assigned to mere Animal
Life?

III. OF HISTORY AND ITS
APPROPRIATE STILE 
Literature as applied to History. Poetry or works of Immagination. History Descriptive and
Narrative. Strict adherence to Truth in History; its importance. 1 to 3.
Display of Genius and Brilliancy of Language in Works of Immagination and Information:
its danger when Truth is lost sight of to some Readers. Abuse of Talents. 3 to 6.
History, its use, and value as an Example. The Danger of a Party Historian as being likely
to mislead. Simple matter of fact best in History. How to distinguish the faithful Historian. 6
to 12.
Character of Livy as an Historian; his Eloquence; not to be imitated as an Historian. A Historian should be a Moralist as well as a Narrator of Facts. Perfection not to be expected in
History any more than any other Human Art. 12 to 18.
Statesmen and Warriors actually engaged not to be relyed on as faithful Historians. Of those
most likely to be faithful Historians. 18 to 22.
Of the use of Metaphors as an Ornament of Speech, condemned in History. Truth the very
Essence of History. Advice to Historians. Some Authors known by characteristic traits in
their Compositions; not so Authors of true Genius and capacity. 22 to 27.
Literature serves to record Speech and address it to the World at Large.
Its Uses are Information or Exercise of Mind & Enjoyment. And from
these uses are derived the Disstinctions of Literary Compositions & their
value.
On the Principle of Information 1 are Formed History 2 Descriptive or
Narrative 3 Theory or Science and Method or Practice of Art.
On the Principle of mental Exercise & Enjoyment are formed all works
of Poetry or Invention whether in verse or Prose.
There are works which professedly operate on both these Principles,
Such as Moral Dissertation in Single Discourse or Dialogue & Rhetorical
Harangue for Perswasion or Pathos. But this mixed or compound  Form
of Speech will be best understood after the other two are separately
considered.
Of Informative Discourse History is the Primary Form. Descriptive History is the Statement of Coexistent Particulars as in the Description of
Minerals Plants & Animals.
Narrative History is the statement in detail of successive Events as in the
origin Progress & termination of Past Transactions.
Descriptive History extends The Field of Knowledge which personal
Observation opened.
Narrative History extends indefinitely the field of Experience and
Teaches to Anticipate or conjecture the Event of Transactions from their
origin and progress.
For this purpose the past should be recorded with the most Rigorous
regard to Reality. So that nothing of Moment be overlooked nothing false
be inserted or nothing Idle or impertinent tho true be retained.
We may thus conceive the object of Narrative History  to be the
detail 4 of what has actually past: so that the Reader may be as nearly as possible in the Condition of an Intelligent Eye & Ear witness of what has
passed & be made to know all that he could have perceived understood seen
or heard if he had been present & let into every passage as it opened in the
course of the transaction.
This however is to be understood of circumstances material to the origin
progress & Event of the Transaction. In this chiefly the parts or Capacity of
the Historian is tried. If he fail in it be his talent for composition other wise
what they may his work is impertinent and worse than useless because it
missleads the mind of his Reader.
In all Literary compositions there is admitted an Effort of the author to
exhibit  & distinguish himself.
Tis needless here to observe how this may be done in works of Imagination or mental Exercise and Enjoyment without affecting the Essential
Qualities of the Work.
In works of information the case is different. The Author is distinguished in some measure by concealing himself. The Essence of his Work is
the display of its Subject. This is to stand forward on every occasion and in
this to the discerning Reader the Person and merit of the Author is most
Apparent or Conspicuous.
This merit however is not the most obvious to the Reader in general &
therefore not the most Aimed at by Authors in general. They endeavour to
exhibit themselves in the brilliancy of their Language their Sentiments
Reflection Penetration and Judgement. So that a Reader who commits himself to the guidance  of his Author comes off with a deep impression of
his Abilities and his Party his opinions or Judgements but scarcely any
memory of the Subject farther than as it served to furnish matter to the
Author’s Genius and ability.
This is the most dangerous abuse of which pretended compositions are
susceptible because it may impose upon Readers 5 capable of real Information when presented to them: but intercepts it by presenting somewhat
plausible but Illusive in its stead.
This Effect is obtained in part by the brilliancy of figurative expression.
Metaphor & Rhetorical Turns and accomplished Periods in which the Subject is rather alluded to as matter of the authors Estimation than as matter
of Information to the Reader. The Information  indeed if any is thought
to be of mean & Vulgar Consideration Compared to the Blaze of Genius
Dissplayed by the Author. He foresees the Event from the very beginning.
He distinguishes the Wisdom of every Action that is to succeed. The folly of
every attempt or Enterprise that is to miscarry. The Actors are in his hands
he extols or decries at Pleasure. He states himself as Master of the show And
with the Trumpet in his hands consigns to Fame or Infamy Persons to
whom he is himself no way comparable in Ranks of Estimation or Power. 6
History we say is instructive but we do not Specify the respect in which it
is properly & peculiarly so.
It is a narrative of past transactions, and by informing us of what has
been in particular instances tends to reveal the actual course of things in
which  we are engaged and which we may lay our account with in the
future as in the past, and so to become prudent in guarding against one
event and in taking measures to obtain another.
Is this all? Does it not also instruck us in the Disstinction of Virtue &
Vice and lead us by examples to Embrace the one and avoid the other.
If it be allowed that example instrucks, such instruction is not peculiar to
History. 7 It may be obtained in Poetry, Novel and Fable of any sort in which
the Good is contrasted with the bad & lights chosen the most effectual to
conduct the Reader’s choice and if the approbation or reprobation of the
Author is of moment this may be obtaind no less & more properly in moral
Dissertion and Estimate of manners.
Altho this is not the specific Object of History yet as it is confessed to be
of great moment, it is not to be neglected even in History so far as it may be
 obtained without marring its Effect in what is peculiar to it & what is
not to be obtained in any other Branch of Literature.
Here no doubt some caution is required. It is known that the Zeal of
Party may warp the Narrative of History and so may Zeal of any kind: but
that Zeal which is peculiar to History. The Zeal of correct & genuine statement of Fact That truth and Reality in comparison to which nothing else is
of any Value in History.
To Instruck by Example is a plausible object: but to corrupt by Example
is no less to be dreaded than the other is to be hoped. If the example of
Cato 8 is powerful with some that of Caesar 9 is no less so with others. And as
the Examples of fashiona Vice are as frequent as those of Virtue Example we may doubt is of Ambiguous Tendency whether in relation of the past
or exhibition of present manners. On this Account even  History has
been reprobated by some Moralists 10 who think that Knowledge should be
sacrificed to Virtue and men kept in Ignorance rather than expose them to
the Seduction of Vice.
Here is not the place to discuss this Question: But the Object of History
it must be confessed is a fair statement of the passed And this it is probable
on the whole will be favourable to the choice of what is best in human Life
call it what you will Wisdom and Virtue or folly & vice. 11
A Man is not qualified to make a choice unless he knows both sides of a
Question And the object of nature does not seem to terminate in that sort of
Virtue which consists in the Ignorance of anything else.
When the Historian states a Fact it is not always necessary he should
either applaud or condemn, if he state it fully & fairly: it is but an ill 
compliment to his reader to suppose he must be told also what to think of
it. 12
In this however Historians seem to place their merit and display their
Eloquence which is indeed more conspicuous in Satire or Panegyric than in
mere Statement of Fact And language or Stile not so much in the use of simple and appropriate terms. As in metaphor that Amplify or extenuate the
matter according as the Author is himself Affected & would Affect his
Readers.
This however is certainly an Abuse in History. Metaphors amuse the
Imagination by presenting analogies novel & Surprising or any way pleasing in their Effect. But in matter of Information  are either of no
Effect or are apt to mislead. To be of any Effect the Reader ought to know
both the Subject from which the metaphor is Borrowed & that to which it is
transferred. When a ship  is said to plow the Waters the metaphor will
mislead a mere Ploughman. Or if a Plough is said to sail over its Field it will
no less mislead a mere Seaman. To a person who is acquainted with both the
Analogy so far as it takes place is amusing but contains no information And
is therefore very improper where information is the Object. 13
In this we may be supposed to exclude from History not only an officious
display of Sentiment, but even all the ornaments of Speech which consist
not merely in propriety of Expression and Perspicuity but in figure Metaphor & Picturesque Language. What do we leave him then by which to
please his Reader or merit the distinction of literary Excellence. Must
Livy 14 strip himself of his Eloquence to write like a mere Journalist or
Recorder of events.
 To Estimate the merits of History We must distinguish the genuine
State & Course of things from all the Colouring and decorations they may
receive from the Partial Favour or dislike of the Eloquent.
The first is of the greatest consequence as constituting Information of
what Men are have been and may be again. The Colours of Rhetoric laid
upon a Subject tend to inform us of an Authors talents compared to the
Other or actual Course of human Affairs surely of very little importance. An
Authors opinion may Mislead & is of little Authority compared to Nature &
reality itself the object of History.
If an Author is ambitious of Praise he must be contented with that which
pertains to the work in which he is engaged.
He must not expect the Praise of Eloquence in a work which Eloquence
would Marr & disfigure or rather if it be Eloquence to treat of every Subject
in the best manner he must  be powerful in that Eloquence which 
appropriate to History. Proper terms that neither amplify nor extenuate
stating every Circumstance of moment to the origin Progress or result of the
transaction he would relate suffering nothing idle to intrude or nothing of
moment to be omitted so that the Intelligent Reader may have no question
or explanation to Ask. If an Author could appreciate the Value of this
Praise, he would Prefer it to any other or at least while  professed History would he covet the Praise of Figurative amplification or diminution.
Livy is justly placed in the first Class of writers or Artist bent on the
decoration not the mere exact Delineation of their Subject but he ought to
have entitled his word the Panegyric not the History of the Romans.
The Romans from the first were accomplished Statesmen. Their opponents Barbarians they were always in the Right their Ennemies in the
wrong Submission to them  was Reason & Justice opposition mere folly
or Caprice. When an Ennemy decline fighting it was Cowardice when
the Romans protracted the War It was Ability and Good Conduct. Every
Roman spoke like an orator & has a speech composed for him in the most
Accomplished Form. 15
Even in this perhaps it may  thought there is Merit, That merit
which Consts in Partiality to our Country. This however is best shown in
Actions & scarcely can be admitted in professed narration of Truth for the
Information of mankind. It is not the ground on which Livy deserves to be
Commended.
His Eloquence is invaluable to those who think this the highest Talent
which man can Arrive. In him it is so abundant as to Cloy and Fatigue his
Readers and tho this may be called a redundance of Ornament it is certainly
an Error or defect in writing. That he was a man of Probity and a  free
Spirit appears in the genrre of his narrations. Tho a relative in the family of
Livia 16 there are expressions or fragments of his lost History remaining 17 in
which he breaths a Republican and Extols the Majesty of Cato in Particular
above all his contemporarys:
The loss of so great a Part of his voluminous & almost miraculous Performance is irreparable.
With all gloss many Particulars of the greatest importance now unknown
must have been learned from him. But whoever aims at the Praise of History must not Copy from him or think that the Eloquence of History Poetry
or Novel or Pleading Pathetic or Perswasion are the same. The Historians
may give Delight & excite Emotion of Every kind: 19 but it is the Effect of
his subject not of his manner unless Simplicity & propriety of terms be
accounted Rhetoric which indeed in all works of mere  Information it
certainly is and of the best kind and of the most powerful in Poetry as well j
as pleading and Attempts to persuade.
It is certainly requisite in History to Study the most proper interesting
Satisfactory forms of Narration. The Reader should no doubt be prepared
for every Successive step he is to make not by Anticipating Events but by
such previous lights as enable him to comprehend what passes. Though in
order to fix his attention it is the Charm of Narration to keep him in suspense to the last. There are Narratives in which the Authors Vanity and
ostentation of Foresight knowing before he begins to write what was the
Event leads him to talk of measures with an Affectation of penetration little
short of an Absolute prediction of what is to happen. And the Reader is left
to admire & enjoy the author’s depth & forsight in lieu of that Suspense
and Gratification which a Well Conducted Narrative affords! But as I
believe both Author & Reader are dissappointed.
An Ingenuous Author will be desirous to make the best  moral
Impressions on his Reader no less than Supply the requisite communication of Political And Military Transaction.
This however is to be done not so much by expression of the Authors
own Sentiment as by the Features or indications of Characters Intentions
and Effects as bring the Rights & wrongs the Merits Benefits or Sufferings
of Person into view & strike the reader with Sentiments of Esteem Admiration & Love or contempt & Hatred towards the guilty Actor or
Congratulation & joy towards the meritorious & Innocent or Commiseration & Sympathy with the Innocent. In this Tacitus 20 is a Powerful Master
of his Readers Heart. In his Stile in general he resembles more the Painters
who work by repeatd masterly stroke that touch the leading points of
Character than by full and finished expression of every Part. Voltair has
somewhere called him a Bel Esprit Malin 21 Because he has touched 
the points that sting his Reader with Hatred or Contempt of Certain
Emperors & the Tools of their Odious Government. But to have Spared
Tiberius 22 or Nero 23 could not be quoted as an Evidence of Love to
Mankind.
An Able Historian may no doubt Benefit his Reader by giving his opinion in terms direct & in his own Person but this is not the Specific of
Historical Instruction And the Author is under the strictest obligation not
to Substitute opinion of any particular for the proper Statement of such Particular nor to suffer his opinion to byass him in the Detail of his Narration.
These Faults turn Pretended History into mere Dissertation & partial
Argumentation which may have its own merit but not the merit of History.
Perfection in History is no more to be expected in human Life than Perfection in any department of human Art.
If it be the Perfection of History to place its Readers in the  Condition of Persons present to every Transaction so far as to every Circumstance
of moment respecting the origin progress & result of such transaction, it is
evident that no one is qualified to execute such a wrong without he himself
was present Observant Intelligent Impartiall & perspicuous in communicating what he knows. Statesmen & Warriours m24 actually Employed are
the most likely to be so accomplished but even they labour under certain
dissadvantages.
They are of a Side & may not be impartial. There  circumstances
which time alone brings into & of which they may not have been apprised
tho’ material to the origin & progress of Affairs.
As the Person who is to record a transaction should know & distinguish n
what  important in each. It follows that Statesmen are the fittest to
record matters of State and warriours to record operations of War. Yet even
they are apt to fail in the Informations required to the general Reader. Professional Men are apt to pass in Silence all matters of Course as too well
known to require being mentioned which nevertheless are required to the
 Information of General Readers.
Caesar no where mentions the depth of his line in Battle and but once
this Circumstance in the dissposition of his Ennemys saying that
Pompeys 25 line at Pharsalia 26 was ten Deep in the Files though his own to
equalize his Front must have been much less & must have varried on different occasions as the extent of Front to be presented required. This however
now is a desidertum in the Military department of Roman History.
For these Reasons perhaps not the Person present & Concerned nor the
Professional Man: but a Person observant of human affairs Intelligent &
impartial collecting from the memoirs of those who were present from the
Skillful & intelligent in their respective Professions what is peculiarly
important in each account of the informations required to the general
Reader & collecting his own informations at Periods when all important
Materials have come into public View & before any of them have been lost
are upon the whole best  qualified to compose informations of past to
future Ages.
In all works of Information whether History of Science The Language
required is simple naming the Subject and its attributes in proper terms
without any aim on the part of the Author to display his Talent for any
other Embellishment of Stile or Composition. What should we think of a
Waiter who being called on for a Glass of Water in stead of bringing it
should set himself to Gesticulate & cut capers to exhibit the Graces of his
Person or who should bring it with the Air of a Dancer handing the Lady in
a Minuet. The most accomplished Master of all the Graces so performing
the duty of a waiter tho he might be admird on any other occasion would be
laughed at on this. The accomplished master indeed is so far Master of his
Art as to be as tenacious of simplicity on some occasions as he might be of
Art & Concerted Grace on any other.
 Among the Ornaments of Stile Metaphor 27 is the most frequent.
In this Figure of Speech terms appropriate to one Subject are transferred
to another And this practice is so much in Favour with some Speakers or
Writers that they treat of every subject not in its appropriate terms but in
terms appropriate to some other Subject. Mind is treated of in Terms appropriate to Matter & Mechanism and in return matter & Mechanism receive
the Appellations of mental affection & Will. The mind receives & retains
impressions of weight & Forces Bodies have their affections of Gravitation
Cohaesion or aversion & repulsion. This in the progress of Language was
often an aid to expression and what was a convenience at first is still
retained as an ornament.
When the orator would Amplify a Subject he borrows the Language of
one that is  greater. When he would lessen or depreciate a Subject he
takes Reverse. Pericles 28 Thundered in the Assemblies at Athens. Thersites
Schreched in the Assembly of Grecian Chiefs. 29 Even when neither of
these Ends is in View we are delighted with the Analogy of subjects that
mutually throw light upon one Another and Metaphors that point out such
Analogies are pleasant. They become so frequent in use sometimes as not to
be distinguished from proper terms. They are as well understood in their
Application to the Subject to which they are borrow as on those from
which they are derivd. Impression on Mind is as well understood as impression on Wax altho the meanings are as different as mind & Body. They tend
to confound our Notions of things & make the Theorist think he can
explain the  Phaenomena of one Subject by the Substitution of another.
Types & Pictures are made to explain knowledge or the Apprehension of
Things. This is another abuse of Analogy & Metaphor to be avoided in
Speculation on Theory of any sort otherwise than as mere illustration or
play of Fancy.
Metaphors have their place in Rhetorical Compositions on account of
their Rhetorical Effects of Elevating or depressing its Subjects.
But in History would on this Account be reckoned a deceit altogether
contrary to the very Essence of History itself. History is truth & its Effect r
is neither Elevation nor depression.
Metaphor as expression or means of Information in History is of very
doubtful Effect. If both the subject from which the Metaphor is taken &
that to which it is applied are known to the Reader the Metaphor may illustrate and please: But if either is unknown it can only mislead by 
Suggesting Identity in place of unknown Analogy. When a Countryman
who never saw a Ship on her Way is told that she Ploughs the Waters. He is
apt to conceive a Team or draught a Furrow broke up Land raised on Edge
or turned over. What else is to plough. The information to a Seaman who
never saw a Plough would be equally imperfect or deceitful to any Person
who never saw either Plough or Ship it would be altogether meaningless or
Blank.
In every Point of View the metaphoric Stile is altogether improper in
History.
According to Swift’s definition of a Good Stile 30 Proper words in proper
Places History may excell in Stile no less than any other denomination of
Writing or Composition.
Its perfection is truth compleat & well Selected Detail. 31 The preceeding
a preparation for the understanding of What is to follow but the future not
to be anticipated without Necessity. The  matter to be so stated as to
have its proper Effect on the Readers mind without any express prescription from the Author of what he should think or feel. It is not necessary that
the Author should be forever out of sight or never address the Reader in his
own Person But the less Frequent occasions of this sort occur the more near
to the Perfection of History.
Authors are Sometimes to be known by their Stile through all the variety
of Subjects of which they treat and on all occasions. This however is rather
the symptom of a Rotine or habit acquired than of Genuine Power to acquit
themselves as the occasion requires.
Genuine Intelligence & Sensibility is equally prepared for every Subject
of which it has the proper Cognizance. As the name of every Subject is different so are the expressions in which it is to be unfolded. As the mind is
differently affected by various subjects and on Various Occasions so is the
very Tone of a speaker or the Stile of a Writer And it is no praise to a speaker
or  writer to say that he is the same on all Subjects and on all occasions.
That he talks of the small in the same Tone with the Great or that he is
always Elevated & solemn or always depressed & familiar.
It should probably be said of a powerful speaker or Writer that he ascends
or Descends with his Subject Simple or Figurative according as he
employed to inform or Agitate his Audience or his Readers. Always Simple
in History sometimes even in pleading a Cause: but when he would carry a
Point or make an impression proportionally Armed with all the weapons of
Rhetorick or declamation. Such a Person is not to be known his Stile otherwise than as the Powerful is known by the effect of his performances.


XI. OF THE CATEGORIES OR CONSTITUENTS OF DISCOURSE AND FABRIC OF THOUGHT
Of the constituents of Discourse. Subject, Quality, Quantity, Number, Relations, Action or
Passion, Time and Place. The Primary order of Being is Power. Man an Intelligent Power
combined with Animal Life. The Power Intelligent consists of 2 points; the Cognitive and
Selective Powers; divided into 2 Branches of Science, Logic and Ethics: described: 1 to 4.
Of Language. Misapplication of some Terms in Language, such as Pleasure, Good, Ambition, Honour, Religion &c. 4 to 8.
Figurative and mysterious Language sometimes of more effect than the simple and concise.8
to 11.
In reciting those of Aristotle 1 I think we mistake in translating ουσια 2
into Substance.
Every thing Substantial in our conception has dimension and occupies
place.
Ουσια is a Being or thing & in the list of Categories is properly
Translatd. 3
A Subject and the other Categories maybe its Quality its Quantity its
Number its Relations its Action or Passion, its Time & Place. b
These to me seem to compleat the whole nothing enters into any statement or discourse that may not be comprehended in one or Other of These
Nine and hence the Parts of Speech are the noun Subjective or Adjective
The Verb and the Date, &c.
What was the Quality &c of one Discourse may be the Subject of another.
And Quality or Power may exist without Dimension & may be itself the
Thing ousia or Subject Qualifyd or impowered.  The Primary order of
Being is Power absolute & unlimited Like Space & Time immeasureable
unlimited unplaced undated And can have no beginning and no End. Tis
Cause not Effect. Tis one. If we should conceive a Number they must be at
one & can have no difference. c
The Secondary Form of Being is Power derivd Specific & limited. Its
Possible & real Varieties are Indefinite. Tis both effect & Cause.
If it be progressive as beginning Intelligence is. It may advance Indefinitely & tend to be at one with the Primary form of Being, but never Reach
it.
The Third or last order of Being is Effect not Power or Cause.
This order of Being is the Material and Scenery of Power.
Man is a Power Intelligent combined with Animal Life &c.
The Power Intelligent may be considered in two Separate points of View.
1 That of a Power Cognitive.
2 That of a Power Selective.
 So viewed it may  divided into two capital Branches of Science.
Logic and Ethic.
Logic is the History & Conduct of the Power Cognitive.
Ethic is the History & Conduct of the Power Selective.
The first recounts the sources of Knowledge The Evidence of Truth of
Generalisation and Arrangement of Physical Law comprehension & Order,
And Concludes with the Canons of Investigation and Argument or
Syllogism.
It is of much Consequence in the pursuits of Science to Anticipate our
End in just definitions. If I were beginning my Studies I would take 
above definitions of Logic & think I could not go wrong or mistake my
Way.
Dr Reid 4 should help me in one part. Lord Bacon 5 And the Naturalists
in a Second and Aristotle 6 in the last.
This Branch of Science however important as it is but the Avenue to a
Mansion in  which The Intelligent Being is to fix his Habitation and his
Throne: To Command his Perfections & his Enjoyment. To correct his
Defects and avoid his Sufferings.
Such is the End of the Power Selective whose the History and Conduct is
to man in a Special degree the Knowledge of himself & his Way to Improvement felicity & Safety.
Armed with this Definition I think that no source of Enjoyment or Suffering should Escape my Notice. Perfection & defects should be justly
Estimated. Enjoyments that mislead should be detected & Sufferings that
promote to conduct to Superior Enjoyment should be Acknowledged &
chearfully endured. And that Institution & manners in human Life could
be justly Estimated and turned to Advantage. I should then not only know
but be master of myself & Arbiter of all my Fortunes. I am now four & five
alass how much time I have lost. 7
 Of Language.
This even in the Dialect Tone Accent & Gesture of Rude Nation has
attaind to a Power beyond what is gained in any other department of human
Life. Yet being the Creature of Practice & the Slave of Custom, it fails the
Philosopher when he would open the Sources of Elevation & felicity to
Mankind beyond the limits of ordinary thought. If he employ words
uncommon or new, he is not understood. If he employ words that are common, they are so spoilt & contaminated in Vulgar use that the effect  to
common readers is far short of his Object.
The Term Pleasure with which a Philosopher of some note would
express the Enjoyment of a Peaceful & liberal mind, was understood by the
Vulgar to mean eating & drinking or other animal gratifications.
The Term Virtue which another would employ to express the attainments of Magnanimity in Goodness Wisdom & Fortitude is mistaken by
the ordinary Reader for Some habits of Moderation or decency in common
Life & external practice.
Good either in its Abstract or Applicate Sense which he would employ to
designate the supreme object of Choice in  every Instace is multiplied
in every Carriers Waggon & in every dealers Store house. It is to be had in
every Market. And money is the great procurer of all Goods to those who
want them & the great Reward of Industry to those who Supply them to
Mankind.
If the Philosopher in search of a term in which to express the great Principle of Progression and incitement of a Mind that Aspires to Excellence
and perfection in every Work or Attainment of the Mind And if he should
employ the term Ambition in this Sense he will be understood to speak of
Vanity or the desire of Fame of Promotion or Power.
 If he employ the term Honour to mark the dignifyed Sentiment of
Integrity and Justice he will be understood to mean a certain Punctilious
requisition of the forms in which Gentlemen are Supposed to treat one
another.
If he speak of Religion or the Elevation of the human Soul to the Conception of God & the order of his Works he will be understood to Speak of
Arbitrary Institutions of arbitrary Rites the observation of Days and distinguishing Forms of Speech which in the distinction of Sects are term
Doctrines & indispensable Articles of Faith.
The Philosopher may possibly do better for his Reader in employing
misterious &  figurative expressions that sett the Ingenuous a thinking
what he means and by that means employ him to find out a just meaning
for himself than he would by aiming at Simple direct and Appropriate
terms which fine persons understand in any other than Vulgar & mean
acceptation.
If any one pass the first Words of Montesquieu, 8 Esprit des Loix 
Rapport qui derive de la Nature des Choses with any thought it 
probable he will not learn much from that Author.
These are figurative And mysterious terms in the  interpretation of
which every Reader may please himself and profit more in the attempt than
he could by any communications in more appropriate terms.
If any one attempt to Illustrate any general Notice by example or particular Reference This author would turn away with disgust. Comment peut-on
dire tout sans un Mortel Ennui. 9
To this Ennui however We must Submit in addressing the Publick,
whilst the mere incitements of thought in The Few are left as the prov
of Genius to Superior minds.
To which the world is most indebted is a question which I shall not
attempt  to decide.
In most branches of science there is little to be gained by attempting perspicuity even to the ignorant. And the profit of every reader is proportioned
to the thought he employs rather than the information he receives, and if a
reader is to emerge from the study of Aurelius or Epictetus a partner in
the felicity which they describe, he must owe it to himself however he may
be disposed to ascribe it to them.

XII. OF THE DISTINCTIONS WHICH MANKIND
EXPERIENCE OR APPREHEND IN THE
NATURE OF THINGS TO DIRECT THEM
IN WHAT THEY PURSUE OR AVOID 
The most comprehensive of these are Good and Evil. Of what may be called Good. Pleasure
and Pain; distinction of Pleasure. True Pleasure is Virtue; various ideas of Pleasure; Man
of Liberal Mind; miser; Friend; Enemy; Benevolent; Malicious. 1 to 12.
Distinction of Good and Evil; of Right and Wrong; Happiness or Misery. What results from
these Distinctions. 12 to the End.
These Distinctions may be comprised in general Titles of which the first
& most comprehensive are Good & Evil And in Specifying the Constituents
of Each of these general Titles we may reckon under that of Good Pleasure
Excellence or Dignity Rectitude or Virtue. With their opposites Pain defect
or meanness Vice or Guilt. 1
In general the  distinction of Good & Evil is apprehended in whatever
we desire or shun And it differs in common use from the distinction of
Happiness & Misery in respect to the Aspect under which the Subject is
considered.
Good refers to the Thing as it is supposd to be in itself.
Happiness refers to the Enjoyment of it. A Quality is Good But the Person who enjoys it is happy.
In the careless use of Terms a man is said to be happy in being Gratifyd
tho in a matter perhaps in the result destructive or Hurtful.
In Science we would Ascertain What is on the Whole most beneficial &
safe or productive of  most Enjoyment & least Suffering. 2 A man is said
to Enjoy when he is conscious of any agreeable to him & to suffer on
the Contrary when he incurs or is Conscious of any thing Dissagreeable to
him.
In descending from these first & most general titles of Good & Evil Happiness & Misery to their Particular applications. The first is Pleasure &
Pain.
Here the use of Language is loose careless & ambiguous. At one time
Pleasure is but another Name for Enjoyment of what is agreeable without
any regard to its Species or result.  And in this sense it cannot be denyed
that the object of every Pursuit is Pleasure & Pleasure itself the Measure of
Happiness.
But in Language no less common Pleasure is contradistinguished to Bussiness and the Man of Pleasure is Distinguishd from the Man of Bussiness
and the Man of Virtue. While it is confessed that Bussiness is often Pleasant
and Virtuous Habits always so.
To account for this seeming contradiction we may observe that Enjoyments are very justly distinguishd into transient  and permanent
Hurtful & Safe Dignifyed & Mean As well as intense And Slight.
The Person who is carryd off by every immediate call of Pleasure without
sufficient Regard to these distinctions is said to be a man of Pleasure for
mere pleasure as such is supposed to be his only Guide.
Another attends to these distinctions & Selects the Best tho on the first
appearance rather a Pain or a Privation than a Pleasure Such as the affairs
which constitute  Bussiness. And the Habits of Beneficence Frugality &
Temperance which Constitute Virtue. 3
In the promiscuous & indistinguishing use of the Term Pleasure Epictetus was no less a Man of Pleasure than Aristippus and Marcus Aurelius than
Heliogabalus. 4
If however the Votaries of Pleasure are so different in their Characters It
is certainly a great Error to Slur over the distinction of Enjoyments by
always affecting the use of one Common Name for all leaving the  party
concerned at the hazard of putting up with the first that presents itself tho
the least Eligible or worst. This Error the Epicureans Committed and many
of them fell a Prey to mere Animal or Brutal Enjoyments.
Men of Bussiness reject Pleasure for Profit And the Virtuous reject it in
the discharge of Their Duty or in the Pursuits of Friendship Publick Spirit
And Proprieties of Manner.
This it may be said is no more than preferring one Pleasure to another &
rejecting the nearest Pleasure for one supposed greater in Prospect.
 Thus returning to the Play of Words And directly in the face of the distinction commonly made between Men of Bussiness and Men of Pleasure
And the Fact that is so familiar. That Some to Bussiness some to pleasure
sake &c.
It is sometimes however stated with an Air of Superiour penetration And
Discovery that every pursuit has Pleasure for its Object And the wise man
must try all before he can decide And as there are Pleasures of  Malice as
well as of Benevolence. The Instinctive Preference of moral Esteem is no
more than a Taste for which or against which there is no ground of Preference but a fair Comparison of the Pleasure it Brings with that it rejects. And
the maxim that Tastes are not to be disputed. 5
It is impossible to derive any Advantage from this Practice of Confounding under one General  denomination of Pleasure things so different as
the Object of The high minded with the mean The Object of the Liberal
with that of the Miser The Object of a Friend with that of an Enemy or of
the Benevolent in general with that of the Malicious.
The Magnanimous no doubt would be Satisfied as well as the Mean or
pusillanimous. But the Satisfaction of the one leads to great Energy and
advancement of Intellectual Power The other to its Degradation  or
Suppression.
Heliogabalus b6 no doubt woud be Satisfied or pleasd no less than Marcus
Aurelius: 7 But Heliogabalus would be satisfied to domineer among Cooks
Buffoons and Prostitutes to have his Stomach replete his Head intoxicated
And his Members laid in Sloth & Stupor.
Marcus severe to himself but lenient and mild to others would not be
satisfied without an effort to resemble the most high in Goodness & Justice 8
And employ in his Station all the energies of Intelligence & Wisdom.
Does it contribute in any degree to the ends of Science to Slur over this
difference of Character by the application to both of one Common appellation of Pursuits of Pleasure? d
And the course of human Nature from the progress of Intelligent Being
to its Stop or retrogradation unless we admit that independent of Weight in
the Scale of Pleasure the Distinction of Right & Wrong of Perfection &
Defect are allowed to cast the Pleasure.
We are told and it is probably true that an infallible Rule of human Conduct would be to Do what upon the Whole would Ensure the highest
measure  Enjoyment & least Suffering.  But Nature does not enable
us to carry our View so far into the results of Consequences of any present
action to Supply this defect. We are competent to discern on the face of
Every transaction what is Right or Wrong And in this we have the Security
of Nature itself that Good upon the Whole will result from what we do from
this paramount & overruling Consideration.
Good & Evil are peculiarly incident to Sentient and Intellectual Power.
In any other Order of Being if any such there  be there is no such
Distinction & with it the distinction of Happiness & Misery Perfection &
defect is peculiar to them also.
The merely Sentient may be preferred to the Rank of Intelligence & the
merely Intelligent to the Wise & Good. We do not know of any Excellence
in Kind Superiour to this vested with adequate Power & Effect. This Therefore is at once the Perfection and the happiness. The Supreme Object of
Creative Will and Proceeding in the case of man tho apparently with 
much Deviation from the direct Road of what is Right to correction and
attainment which is founded on the experience of Partial Evil as well as
Good.
Such is the School of Wisdom and of Goodness also in Man is destined to
be as befits Intelligent Power in himself the Source of Advancement Excellence & Felicity.
The Power is given by the Author of his Being but the Attainment is
learned or Acquired not given.
The Object of moral Study & Science is to  treat of the distinction on
which we are of the Effects of each And of the best and Secure on which
 can proceed.
The Distinction of Profit and Loss refers chiefly to the increase or diminution of Stock or Possession. If any one were to Act solely on this
Disstinction he would of Course be Sordid illiberal & unconscionable in his
Disposition & in every Act of his Life. But as the means of Self Preservation
come under this Title it must be admitted for part in  the deliberations
of every Wise or Prudent man.
The means of Subsistence being Necessary to Life they are of the same
Value as Life itself that is to say may be the occasion either of happiness or
Misery. In the Proper Use they are occasions or materials of Prudence Justice and Beneficence of Art Diligence Frugality & good Conduct in many
respects Constituent of Wisdom Goodness & Independence The very
Essence of human Perfection & Felicity. But in the  abuse they may be
the occasion & materials of eve opposite Evil Folly Injustice Intemperance Dissease Prodigality Beggary and Slavish Dependence. The Prayer of
the Wise therefore is not for Profit but for the proper use of what he has.
The distinction of Right & Wrong relates to the dispositions intentions
And actions of Men.
With the Conscientious it is never forgotten & directs if not Their 
Ends in every pursuit at least the means by which to Obtain . The
Result is integrity Probity & Candour. The consciousness of Innocence
Purity exemption from Blame Remorse Shame Fear and every degrading &
torturing Passion.
Prosperity And Adversity are akin to profit & Loss depending for their
Value on the proper use which is another name for Virtue.
Prosperity abused is Pride Vanity and Insolence the Worst of Vices In its
proper use may be the Occasion of many Virtues.
The Mean Spirited Sink under  Adversity and are degraded. The
Strenuous contend with it & surmount it. To Men in general it is a School
of Fellow feeling of Charity of Considerate Caution in Judging of Others.
Perfection & Defect. They who act chiefly on this Disstinctions tend to
Magnitude in every Pursuit In vices or where they mistake the Application
of Excellence they everywhere tend to Excess Pride or Contempt of Others
Extravagance in Shew Emulation Ambition of Rank and Fame &c.
When  Excellence is well Understood the Highminded Excel in
Modesty Benevolence Candour As well as Magnanimity.
Upon the Whole there is nothing unalterably Good But Wisdom and
Benevolence. Even Power itself may be abused and is no where absolutely
Safe: but where the Goodness & wisdom are also Eternal And Infinite.


XIX . OF THE CATEGORIES 
Of the word the Categories. The Power and Goodness of God. All things made for the
Progress of Man to Perfectibility. Man, the cause of his own Happiness or Misery. 1 to 5.
Categories of Aristotle. All Being is Power. Power of Resistance, Force &c. 5 to 8.
Of Vegetation, Organisation, Animation. The Intelligent Power Communication &c. 8 to
11.
Of the First Cause or Eternal Power. Man’s Existence. Perceptions. Senses. Communication
or Intercourse. Society. Works of Creation the Language of God to Man. The necessity of
being Good to be Happy. Man’s happiness depends on himself. 11 to 18.
Of the Mind of Intelligent Power in Man. Contemplation of God’s Works leads to the Mind
up to God and Happiness. 18 to the End.
Aristotle in his ambitiously comprehensive arrangements of Being has
referred the Whole to ten Heads called Categories 1 or Meanings and Matter of Statement of which The first or ουσια 2 is unfortunately translated
into our Language by the term Substance & is made to mean what is not
only real but substantial and in this Sense  mathematical Point 3 tho a
meaning with Place Relations &c is not a Substance.
The Meaning of Categories with this Correction may be stated in our
Language under  Terms Subject or Thing Quality  Quantity,
Number Relation Power Action Passion Time & Place. 4
It is pleasing thus to conceive all Being as Meaning or Matter of Statement to Mind And in Fact as all things flow from Design or Mental
Purpose So they are essentially Relative to mind for any distinction of Good
or Evil Excellence or defect applicable to them. A Planetary System we say
is Magnificently Beautifull. The Pearl The Ruby & the Diamond are the
Ornament of Scepters & of Crowns. But Suns & Planets are the Ornaments
of Scepters & of Crowns, but Suns & Planets composed of Diamond or Pearl
were but Dross without the mind that formed & beholds them.
The Material Universe itself is but the Emanation of  Omniscience &
Almighty Power. And its fairest Corner but  Department for the Nursery
& exercise of Nascent or Created Minds. Without Intelligence there would
be neither Good nor Evil Excellence or Defect. Count if you Can the Myriads of human being that every moment  sends into Life. 5 For
them the Sun is made to Shine & for them this diversifyed Scene is opened
that each may Act & lose or Acquire for himself & as he loses or Acquires
Intelligence the essence of Being proceed for Ever or Sink into the Pit of
Nonentity from which he Sprang.
The Soul of Man we say is  immortal. It is not essentially So. It arose
from Mortality & from Death previously Eternal had Life & thought
bestowed. These in Essence are but a Power to Ascend among Being. If it
does not Ascend it will Sink among Beings & even forfeit its Power.
Why has the Almighty proposed this Alternative.
That there might be like him a Power however a Power tho in a remote
degree Self forming to Wisdom & Goodness. Upon this Plan Socrates is
gone up to Eternity & his Murderers Sunk again into Dust.
 Give Scope to Thought.
It must have a Subject.
The Subject may have its Qualities Its Quantity Its Number Its Relations
Its Actions Its Passions Its Time & Place and so Forth. 6 Such are the Categories of Aristotle. The first or ουσια Being or Subject We Translate into
Substance 7 without  considering how much that Term in our Vulgar use
of it is apt to Mislead. Substance in our imagination has dimension and
place and however airy or Vapid occupies Space.
Ουσια 8 is a mere Being or Subject tho no more than a Mathematical
Point 9 a Thought or Affection. It is therefore mere Entity or Abstraction of
Being.
From this most General or Universal Term of Entity or Subject The first
Step towards Specification Is Power: and we may venture to say That  all
Being is Power.
Corporeal Being is the Power of Resistance to Change.
The Change it resists is that of Place or disposition of Parts. That is from
Rest to Motion from Union to Separation of Parts Change of Velocity
Change of Direction & so forth.
In the Exercise of this Power of Resistance The following Laws are
Observed.
Body remains in its State of Rest or uniform Motion till some Force is
impressed.
The Change is proportioned  to the Force impressed.
In the Application of Force Action and Reaction are equal & Contrary as
much as the Force gains upon the Resistance it expends of itself.
Vegetation is a Power of Organisation And Assumption of Nourishment
to growth & dimension. Animation is a Spontaneous Power joined to Sensation Perception & Choice or instinctive direction. All the Powers of
Animation may accompany Intelligence.
Intelligence is a Power to know  to Compare to Deliberate to Judge
and to determine resolve or Will.
It knows by Consciousness Sensation Perception or Experience And Testimony. The Powers of Intelligence constitute Personal Existence &
Resposibility.
Persons are Many & may hold Communication or be known to one
Another.
The Powers of Communication are Sensations & Perceptions.
These are Mental Appurtenances  and may have no other form of
Existence: But as to every mind they come originally from Abroad They are
Evidence of  external Existing Cause. And as they may be emitted in
rturn are to different Persons means of Communication or Evidence of
Coexisting Persons & their meanings.
In Knowledge nothing can be more certain than that which cannot be
Doubted. 10
Existence therefore is Certain And in the Form of some must have
been Necessary  and Eternal. For we cannot doubt that have a beginning then must be a Cause & the Primary Cause have ever many must have
been of itself for ever without a previous Cause. 11
Power Eternal is God by Necessity unlimited And competent to every
possible Effect.
From this Power all Existence Emanates or Exists in it.
The Meanings of Men Communicate to one Another  in Sensations
and Perceptions bear intimation of Ends & Means of Intellectual Power
And to Persons reciprocally a communication of Persons one with Another.
The Perception of Limbs & Organs of which Every Person has Cognisance in himself. And the Repetition Of Actions or expressions to which he
himself is competent is the signal.
 Feeling sight Hearing Taste and Smell and the Perceptions to which
they give occasion are matters in which the mind may be intirely Passive.
To the Person feeling &c. The Perception is in some Instances is that or
the Perception of what he calls a Part or Members of himself As when with
on hand he feels some other Part of his Body &c. or it is a feeling 
hearing or Sight coming from above and giving perception of Separate or
Collateral Being.
Perceiving of Others what he perceives of himself & what he can give
them like occasion to Perceive is Society Intercourse or Conversation.
The Communication So made may bear the Characters of Accident or
design of Wisdom or Folly.
The Character of design counts of Ends & Means.
Of wisdom Important & beneficent Ends well concerted or effective
means.
Ends such as Man conceives  and means such as he is known to
Employ are the Evidence of Man to Man.
Ends more Vast And means above the reach of Man to employ are Evidence of Power Intelligent or Mental Superior to Man Perhaps of Power
Eternal & Omnipo.
The Sensations which Men give & Take constitute the Society or Intercourse of Men.
The Sensation of Ends & Means above the Sphere of Man is the Communication or Revelation of God to his Intelligent Creatures.
 Suns & Planets Sea & Land Atmosphere Clouds Winds Rain Springs
Running Stream Fertile Soil Woods Lawns Hills & Valley Flocks &
Herds Artists Materials of Art uniform Laws of natural Production Occasions of Action to the Active & of Progression to the Progressive. The
Power of Learning to be happy to the living or Sensitive Are the Language
or Revelation of God to man.
His Being & Means are equally per in the part as in the Whole in
that small &c.
 The first and greatest order of Being is that which Exists of itself. The
Lowest order of Being is that which is made altogether what it is. Such we
conceive to be matter or Body.
An Intermediate Order of Being. Having Power but committed to itself
for the exercise of this Power And being of itself happy or Miserable Such is
Created Intelligence.
As Power is the Essence of Being the Power  of Enjoyment & Perfection is peculiar to the living or Sentient Conscious & Intelligent Forms of
Being.
Where Being is Necessary it is also Perfect In Will Omnipotent Therefore Happy unbounded in Wisdom & Goodness Eternal & Immense
unlimited to Time or Place. It must be infinite in Number as well as Greatness or Perfection.
But the Infinitely Perfect however Numerous cannot be different without imperfection must Coincide in every Instance Whether of 
Conscious or Will and be therefore at one in all things the same and
Unity of Being.
The Germs that Result from This Eternal Power Being endowe with
conscious separate Existence Are not Powers to be perfect & Happy But
the Power of Progression or Advancement in direction pointed to Perfection & Happiness.
The Line in which they proceed has no End. If it had an End it would
place them  where it is impossible for them to Arrive that is At One
with God.
Originating in Defect & with a Power of progression only there is no
Measure of temporary aberration which they may not exhibit for the Experience of Evil as well as of Good tends to correct Error & constitute that
Felicity which Consists in Choice. 12
The Pupil of Wisdom may learn to be Wise And happy but must become
so of himself  made so at the Power or Will of Another. In this if in
any Sense it is said That Man is formd after the Image of God.
In this Image alone is the Criterion of Worth or Excellence to be found.
The Power to be happy or of Progress is that Alone which gives Value to
being.
The Power of matter may be such as to form a Scene for the Action of
Men i13  give occasion to thought and like furnish Materials to the
Artist  and accommodations to the Restive and Contemplative excercise Inquiry to the Curious The means of Beneficence to the Charitable and
of Communication & intercourse from Mind to Mind And from the Eternal
to the Nascent & progressive Being he has formed.
But apart from the Subserviency of Such Scenery to mind Immensity
replete with Diamonds And with Gold ever bespangled with innumerable
Suns & Planetary Systems would be of no more value than  mere empty
Space. 14 What were the Diamond on which it Sparkles or the Sun himself
without that little organ on  the Power of Vision is bestowed.
Admire as we may the Material System ’tis made for Mind alone And the
Fairness and Magnificence of its form is but the Evidence it bears of that
Eternal Goodness Wisdom & Power of which it is the Work. The Gift of
Eternal Mind to  form an Equipage for those who are Travelling from
Below toward the higher Scenes of Being.
It is true that the mere Sensation or Perception of what we call the Material World would have the Same Effect with that we call its reality. And
indeed its reality in respect to us is no more than our perception of it the
mere Appurtenance of Mind.
And as mind is the Eternal Mode of  Existence it is pleasant to think
That there is yet no other nor ever be any Other.
Men who Speculate profoundly on the Essence of Matter incline to this
opinion. And  the Slightest inqui into the Cause of our Sensation
are inclined to entertain the same opinion respecting the Connection of
Perception with its external Objects.
This Doctrine I embrace with fond Conviction.
 Who would not Gladly tell the Sun & all these Globes on which he
Shines; Ye are my pleasure grounds & but the Steps on which my Mind
Ascends to God. Even when above your Height I shall not cease to rise.
Blest be the Power that gives Eyes to see & thoughts to comprehend your
Order So Significant of Might Benevolence & Wisdom.
This Doctrine is in the Department of mere Thought not of Art or of
Action and no way affects the Conduct of life.
Common Sense 15 is  the same whether a Person professes to act on
the Distinction of his Perceptions or on the Disstinction of Things
Perceived.
His perception is still the only Ground on which he can act and his
Action will be the Same in avoiding the Perception of Suffering as in avoiding its Cause.
How Idle then is it to labour on Speculations that have no Consequence
or Effect.
Tis true that in Practice The Theory of Corporeal Forms 16 has no Effect
But in  thought we may repeat its Effects are immense.
The first or Eternal Principle of Existence is Inteligence as appears from
the Design & order of his Work but the Work itself is merely Spiritual Consisting of Mind & its Procession of Sensations perception and imagination
or Thought.
To Die is the discontinuance of one System of Perceptions to enter upon
Another: 17 & mental Existence is still the same And its Power of Enjoyment the only distinction that gives value to Being. Without this
Magnitude and Figure exist  in Vain & present no Reality to lead the
will or the choice of Intelligence.
In thought there is no limit to Space Whether it be full or only give place
to separate orbs of Matter is in itself Perfectly indifferent And of moment
only as the one is Recipient of Order & is a Department of Wisdom Goodness & Power. The Other is nought but impenetrable non Existence and
Death.
A Pause to Theory. Who can account for Existence? Who would ever
believe its Reality if he could  disbelieve his own. 18 But here it is; The
difficulty is removed and other Beings to any extent may exist as well as
mind.
The only Form of Being which I cannot doubt is mind & its appurtenances or Provisions of Sensations Perception and Thought.
This then is the Form of Being distinguished in the Superiour assurance
of its Reality and I am Warranted in thinking it has prevailed from Eternity
& will prevail forever.
It were perverse  to know this & yet to controvert the existence of
Mind beyond the Organs of a human Body. 19

XX . OF THE DISSTINCTIONS ON WHICH IT
IS THE LOT OF MAN TO DELIBERATE 
Of the Constituents of Good and Evil; Happiness and Misery; Enjoyment and Suffering;
Excellence and Defect; Beauty and Deformity; Right and Wrong; Virtue and Vice; Prosperity and Adversity; Pleasure and Pain; Profit and Loss. On the choices of one or more of
these particulars the Characters of Men depend. 1 to 4.
Of the Interested; the Voluptuous; the Highminded &c. Good and Evil incident to each; to
secure the Good and avoid the Evil, is Wisdom. 4 to 8.
Conscience, the supreme Arbiter and Bias of Nature may mistake. Happiness is the chief
Good. 8 to 9.
What is Happiness? Epicurus and Zeno’s seeming contradiction. To be virtuous is to be
Happy. 9 to 11.
Self Preservation, its influence on Man’s conduct. Selfishness. Prudence &c. 11 to the End.
It is Characteristick of Living sentient and Intelligent Being to be susceptible of Good & Evil.
To be possessed of Good is Happyness. To incur Evil is Misery.
It is further Characteristic of Intelligent Being to be the artificer of his
own Condition 2 & to be vested with a choice in detail among particulars
that may be referred to the general disstinctions of Good & Evil Happiness
or Misery.
On these distinctions in general  there cannot be any deliberation.
But it is frequently doubtful to which of these heads a particular should be
referred.
And under these most General distinctions others are comprised stating
the Constituents of Good & Evil under different Aspects denominations
under which men would descend to particulars: but have their expressions
Still in comprehensive Terms. Such as Enjoyment & Suffering Excellence &
Defect Beauty & Deformity Right & Wrong Virtue & Vice Prosperity &
Adversity.
On distinctions so general as even these are there is no room for deliberation untill  they came to be applied to different Instances, or Men make
their option or acquire their habits of being chiefly occupied by one or
other of these disstinctions in preference to the others.
Some men in the choice of particulars are chiefly occupied by the distinctions of Pleasure & Pain Others by the distinction of Excellence & Defect
Right & Wrong Profit and Loss. 3 And on this diversity The Characters of
men in a great measure depend.
The Votaries of Pleasure. Of Gain of Excellence Rectitude & Virtue
exhibit  different Characters tho all of them would be happy and aim at
what they conceive to be good.
When we have reduced the disstinction on which Men Act in detail to
the general Heads of Profit & Loss Pleasure & Pain Excellence & Defect
And class men accordingly into The Interested The Voluptuous, & the
High minded Such is the present State of man that under each of these
heads there is both Good & Evil.
The Interested may be Frugal & Industrious or rapacious & 
avaritious.
The Voluptuous may be Inoffensive & humain or Effeminate &
Debauched.
The high minded may be Benevolent & Just or Contemptuous and Arrogant. So that when under any of these general Titles we have chosen our
Class The great Task of human Wisdom Still remains to secure the Good &
avoid the Evil incident to each.
This is Wisdom and Happiness or the Supreme Good consists in a proper
Choice of particulars 4 under each.
Frugality without avarice Innocence and  Complacency without
Effeminacy or Debauchery. Benevolence and Justice themselves a bar to
Contemptuous or Arrogance.
Philosophers in their different applications of the term Chief Good. 5 For
Pleasure Interest or Virtue & Excellence without Observing that each of
these tho separately expressed & supposed different when happily pursued
Actually terminate in one & the same point.
It is the Interest Pleasure & Excellence of a man to be Happy.
These are all supreme Objects of desire And Nature is not so inconsistent
as  to expose the Intelligent Being in aiming at one to forgo the Other.
The Pleasure he ought to aim at is the most Agreeable & the most secure.
The state  highest Enjoyment & least Suffering.
Here is matter of Calculation for the most part easy & obvious in the
result. Tho’ carried to the utmost or extending to the past present and
Future is beyond the reach of  human Faculties. To cut Short in many
Instances Nature has Affixed a mark and given a Byas to the preferable
Pleasure.
The Right in contradistinction to the Wrong And Conscience the
Supreme Arbiter & Byas of Nature in this distinction.
In following this Byas we sometimes appear to reject Pleasure and Rank
but in Fact secure The highest Profit Pleasure & Elevation of Nature.
 The Question then among the Sects of Epicurus Zeno or Aristotle is not
what is the Chief Good. For this by the Confession of all is Happiness: but
by what name is it most safely designed in entering on the detail of Practice.
Conscience may mistake as well as Appetite or Interest: but not so frequently & its Gratifications are the preferable pleasures & gains of human
life.
It appears then most Safe to Speak with the Stoics and go where Conscience and the Love of Virtue leads.  Virtue is supremely pleasant to
those who profess it.
To Epicurus then we may say if this be the pleasure you mean as you tell
us when you come to particulars it is why not Specify it at once & not leave
us to contend with a Vague or general Term which every one will apply in
his own way The Childish the Effeminate The Debauched all of them in a
Way which you yourself will reject.
Virtue is candid Benevolent highminded Courageous & Temperate. You
cannot  detract from it without impairing Enjoyment or the admission
of suffer.
The uncandid repine at another Good.
Benevolence is pleasant. Indifference at best is blank and Malice is
Suffering.
The low mind is drooping and mean.
The Coward trembles And the intemperate Suffers from disgust or
dissease.
The interested and the Selfish are Supposed equivale terms and
applied with dissapprobation  and disslike.
Why? Is it faulty to mind our own Concerns & be careful of ourselves?
No. The Author of  says not!
The first law of Nature to every living Creature is Preserve thyself. Whoever says Otherwise either Counteracts Nature or mistakes himself.
If I should limit the appellation of Self to this Animal life and the Appellation of Interest to its preservatives and Accomodations. Still even in this
Sense the first Law of  Nature or Self preservation is not only blameless
but the most continual & unremitted in its operation and Effects.
The Parent will expose himself & the Citizen on Occasion to preserve his
Country: but these are great and occasional Efforts. The ordinary State of
Nature is a Vigilance for personal Wellfare & Safety And on this the Author
 Nature chiefly rests the preservation of his living Works.
But if the  Appellation of Self be not limited to mere Animal Life
&c. but extend as it ought to every constituent of a rational or Intelligent
Being to the mind its attainments Affections & Habits or what is best under
these designations Wisdom Goodness & Fortitude. In this Acceptation of
Self. The Virtuous alone are Selfish And Sefishness that Aspiring Ambition to resemble the Supreme God. Which in the Caesars of Julian 6 is made
the Characteristic of Marcus Aurelius 7 And is actually the object  of
that Work which we all the Meditations of Antoninus: 8 but in the original is entitled The Consideration of His Own Affairs. 9
To the Vulgar Selfishness is the love of personal Security & Money So little careful we are to fix the terms on which we rest the whole Estimate of
human life. And whilst we require Virtue as indispensible  allow it to
respect the good of Others More than our own And thus suffer a misnomer
of Self to undermine the edifice  of Morality which we profess so great
An Anxiety to raise.
The Praise of Virtue we are told is founded on its publick utility. 10
Strange that a person distinguished for Candour Humanity Benevolence
and Sobriety should forget how valuable these qualities were to himself.
The Fact is that in choosing his Friends & in acting for himself he made no
mistake but in speculating on Virtue he thought of External Actions only
altho when pushed in Argument he was forced to Admit that Moral Estimation was agreeable to the mind and to external actions only as expressive of
mind. h

XXI. OF THE INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM 
Of the mind or Intellectual part of man; subserviency of matter to mind. The Dangers and
Difficulties man has to encounter through Life, is but an Exercise for the expansion of the
Germ of Intelligence with which he is possess’d. Matter of no value but in its relation to
Mind. 1 to 8.
Is the Existence of Matter necessary to give us the Knowledge of God and of one another?
The connection of Mind and Matter; our Perceptions; Sensations &c. Of the Material
World. Bodies; Expansion; Contraction; Attraction &c. The Wisdom and goodness of God
visible in the Intellectual and Material World, and tends to Man’s progress to Perfectibility
and Happiness. 8 to the End.
It is said that the Indian Philosophers of Old considered the multiplication of mind or Intelligence as the sole Object of Creation and mantained
that the material Fabrick was altogether Subservient to this That it served
merely to Manifest the Eternal mind to his Intelligent Creatures, and form
to them the links of communication with one Another.
 It may no doubt be safely Assumed that is at least one Purpose for
which the material System is formed: But it is in other Respects also well
fitted as a Nursery to the Intelligent Being of Man. In him the Germ of
Intelligence is to be evolved & enlarged by its proper exercise Observation
and Experience.
Altho in Infancy he is amply provided for with little or no Effort 1 of his
own yet to his opening Faculties continual occasions of exertion 2 are presented to him. With the Stimuli of Animal  Life he has its wants to be
Supplyed advanages to be aimed as Difficulties to be removed Dangers to
be encountered And Sufferings to be guarded against or Aswaged.
To his Active Nature 3 the Active Scene is accommodated. And to his progressive Nature The Observation he is concerned to make the Lessons of
Experience & the faculties acquird by Practice are fully & Specifically
accommodated.
In this manner is the Creation of that Intelligence with which we are
acquainted conducted and  carried on from Age to Age. The End is the
multiplication & Advancement of Minds. The means are in part at least the
occasions supplyed throughout the Intricacies difficulties allurements or
allarms of a Material System.
But what is this Material System in the great Globe of this Earth merely
Subservient to the living creatures scarcely perceptible on its Surface. Is the
mighty Sun a Million of times its bulk placed merely for the use of a few
such Nurseries of impalpable living Creatures? Yes! We may say, For 
mind altho it has no Bulk is that alone which is entitled to the distinction of
Greatness of Excelence or Beauty. And the Material World if Commensurate to Space & immensity itself would have no value or Obtain any
distinction but in its relation to mind alone. 4 The Diamond has no
brillancy but through the Visual Organ that conveys it to Mind & if Infinite Space were replete with such matter all would be darkness indifference
& Death. 5 Matter has no Value but in its relation to mind, As a material of
art & means  of Beneficence. It has no Beauty but as it bears the Marks
of Ingenuous  employd by Man or The Majesty of Eternal
Wisdom & Goodness imprinted by that Almighty Power who alone is great.
Even to Man the material World is of no moment but as he perceives it.
Let the perception cease & the Universe of Matter is as Nothing: 6 Be it
the Will of God that his Perceptions return tho without any returning Matter; his condition is fully restored; And the Scene of life & intelligence is to
him precisely the same as  upon the supposition of reality in the Object
as well as in the perception of it.
Our sensations & Perceptions have their causes apart from us. We know
not what they are but the Sensations & Perceptions are conditions of Mind
And our own.
Earth Water & Air &c &c Are Names which we give to our Perceptions:
but Sensation Perception thought and Mental Affection are all that we have
give them what names we please.
Of this their can be no doubt & it is possibly all that we are qualifyed to
say respecting the Actual State of Existence: the  World around us. Men
of Speculation 7 may fancy what they please but a World of mental Sensation
And Perception or a world of Separate Being perceived will be to us in
respect to Conduct Society Religion and Science precisely the same.
Is the actual existence of Matter Necessary to give us the Knowledge of
God & of one Another? For we draw the same Conclusion from our Perceptions that we would from matter perceived, and the fact is that we have no
other premises on either Supposition from which to draw our conclusions.
Is it  respectful to Suppose that The Almighty has given us falacious
Perceptions? 8 We do not suppose it nor are our perceptions fallacious. They
are indeed Mental not corporeal existences: but the most certain grounds
on which we may rely in all our designs Selections and pursuits. My perception of Precipice or Fire does not deceive me for if I avoid them I am safe if
I do not the Consequence may be Fatal: but the Admonition was true &
beneficently Given.
I have sometimes found fault with  those who would explode the
Existence of Matter because the question was altogether Nugatory & could
have no consequence in the Conduct of Life. But there is equal  to
find fault with those who contend for the Reality of matter 9 this being
equally void of any Consequence in the Conduct of Life.
In this no doubt the question is Nugatory & the Solution indifferent. But
the mind independent of its perceptions from Abroad has a World of its
own in which to range. Having the Knowledge of God & our fellow 
Creatures it is acceptable & congenial to suppose a Universe of Mind with
Eternal Wisdom goodness & omnipotence at its head than so great a mass of
lifeless materials as this perceptible world seems to imply.
It is justly thought absurd to Suppose that a Material Cause  produce Intelligence: but is it less so to suppose that thought or Intelligence
could produce solid matter. It is difficult to conceive how mind & body as
in the Case of Man can be united & mutually affected one with the Other. If
our Sensations & perceptions be conceived merely as a  Mode of our
Mental Existence and no more Every difficulty of this Sort will dissappear.
To be born is to be brought into a Scene of Specific Perceptions the
means of Communication and the occasions of Action. 10 To Die is to
exchange the first System of perceptions for a Subsequent one 11 And the
Mind immortal receives with its advanced qualities new means of Communication And occasions of Superiour Exertion and Continual Progress.
These Considerations may incline us to adopt the Idea of a System purely
Intellectual System  the Work And Province of Eternal Mind. And it is
matter of Curiosity to Observe by what Steps men of Speculation have been
led in different Instances to question the existence of matter in any other
form than that of mental perception.
Some of those who have examined the Sources of information & the
causes of belief have found the evidence of a material World deficient and
accordingly withheld the Assent. 12 Having Assumed that all our knowledge  of things must rest upon certain Ideas Types or Representations
of them in our Minds and considering that Representations are no evidence of Facts they deny the existence of matter as being Supported on no
other evidence than the Idea of it in our Minds.
Whatever we may think of this Conclusion the Process of supposed Reason on which it is founded is certainly incorrect. In their Haste to come at
their Hypohesis of Ideas in the mind they overlook the most important part
of the Fact in our Cognisance of the material World.
We do not first harbour Ideas or Representations  of a Material
World and then proceed to take proofs of its Reality. 13 We begin with perceiving it And form the best notion of it we can from continued
Observation.
Perception is prior to Proof and the most convincing foundation upon
which any proof of Fact can rely. We have seen the Earth & the Firmament
& Cannot doubt their Existence as for the Types or Ideas you mention we do
not perceive them & have no reason to believe their Existence & have no
difficulty in thinking of the Sun & the Moon while they continue to 
pass over our head in the Sky. Our Observations in many cases may be hasty
& superficial but when properly made are the best information we have to
conduct us through hazards of the greatest amount.
Things may not be as we perceive them but your attemp to disprove
them proceeds upon an assumption which we neither perceive nor otherwise know to exist.
Those who attend to the Facts perceived in the Phaenomenon of Body
proceed more directly to a Solution of the Question relating to the existence
of matter  extended and Solid. Body consists of parts. It is Subject to
expansion & Contraction the parts then must approach or recede while they
recede they cannot be in Contact. If they ever be in contact they cannot contract. But nobody is exempt from Expansion by heat or contraction by Cold.
Therefore no body is made up of parts in Absolute Contact. 14
On this ground it is Concluded that Contact no where exists in Body that
the parts or attoms of which it is Composed owe their cohesion or fixture to
attraction in a certain state of Contiguity not of Contact.
 The fixture indeed a precise State if Continued, must require some
power to counterballance the attraction & retain every part in its place Otherwise absolute contact would ensue And the Volubility of Living Nature
would Cease.
This Catastrophe is Averted by an eminent theorist (Boscovich) 15 who
instead of parts or Attoms composing Body has recourse to Mathematical
Points which having no dimension, never can touch. Attractions & Repulsions from & towards these points at different distances  ballance one
Another so exactly as to Constitute limits of Bodies and by the different distances at which they Act form all the variety of Corporeal Substance with
which we are acquainted.
If this theory were lyable to no Objection but that which lys against every
mere Hypothesis it certainly should be rejected.
The Phaenomenon of Body is certainly in our apprehension Coeval or
prior to any Law of Nature from which it can be explaind. Unless we recour
to that first Law of All The Will of  Almighty God by which all minds
exist and Obtain their conditions constituted in their own Nature or in
other Natures with which they communicate. That the Condition of Man is
effected in both ways cannot be doubted. He stands related to his Maker &
to fellow Creatures of Intelligence like his own. The Link or Channel of
Communication with either is the perception he receives & gives from the

The immediate Object of the Inquiry now depending before the Commons of Great Britain is Whether Sir Wm Howe is a Man of Capacity & has ably conducted The American War.

This Question is of very little consequence to the Publick & may be decided in any Way without affecting the State otherwise than by promoting or defeating the Purpose of Party.

The Inquiry however has led to Questions of more Moment.

1st How far the State has a Right to Employ the Ordinary means of War in order to Suppress a Rebellion which has outlived all the Grievances from which it was Supposed to Arise, & how far his officers have already Abused these means.

And What Prospect  remains to Great Britain of being able to effect a Reunion with Her Colonies.

As to the 1st Question. It is not easily conceived how Subjects in Arms against Their Sovereign & in Alliance with his ennemys, should be entitled to more favour than the Subjects of a Forreign Prince at War upon some problematical Questions of State.

The Subjects of a forreign Prince involved in a War by their Sovereign may not have incurred any personal Guilt by that Circumstance And it is not Lawfull to Distress them except so far as that is allowed in order to Disstress the State to which they belong.

But Subjects in Rebellion incurr a Personal Guilt & may be disstressed not only in order to disstress their Community but likewise in order to Punish Their Crime.

When a Controversy nevertheless, whatever may have been its origin,  has been brought to the ordinary Issue of War. It must be conducted according to the Rules of War least Innocent Subjects employed against Rebels & Criminals shoud be exposed by Retaliation to Suffer what Justice permits to be inflicted on Rebels & Criminals Alone.

War is supposed to permit Reprisals, Circumvention, Force, Bloodshed Slaughter & a Variety of means that may be employd to force an Ennemy to Justice.

In the use of these means however the operations of War are limited with a View to the End, & to the just measure of Hostilitys that may be necessary to Obtain it.

No Act of Hostility not even the smallest Molestation to the Person against whom it is employed is Lawfull Except so far it is necessary to prevent a Wrong, or  to redress an Injury.

The Principle from which the Rules of War are derived is. That a Person apprehending wrong may defend himself at the Expence & Hazard, and if necessary even by the Suffering & Destruction of the Party who wrongs him.

And the Source of the Limitation is likewise Obvious: That he is not to do harm wantonly nor beyond what is necessary to preserve or recover his Right.

The first & most ordinary Species of Hostilitys in case an ennemy persist in the Wrong, Are seizing his Person & Effects or His Territory & in case of Resistance, Military Execution & Slaughter.

1st — A Party Aggrieved has a right to make War at the Expence of His Ennemy, And therefore has a Right that [xxx] is never Contested, to raise Contributions, to exact  Supplys of every Sort, as far as they are Necessary to Support, the War or as far as they tend by distressing the Ennemy to compell the Ennemy to Justice.

Armys on the Territory of an Ennemy sometimes Spare the Countrey from a Consideration of Safety & Expedience to themselves.

It is expedient to Protect a Countrey in which an Army is to make is the Seat of War, in order to enjoy its Resources which might be exhausted at once if the Countrey was laid Waste or exposed to Rapin.

An Army endeavours to Avail itself of the Resources of an Ennemys Countrey either by Exacting regular & Measured Contributions under a perfect Security to the Persons & remaining Property of those who pay those Contributions.

Or by means Still more Mild by requiring the Ordinary Supply of the Camp at a Marketable & Reasonable Price. 

If the reasonable dem[and] whether of a free Contribu[tion] or Marketable Supply a[re] refused it is undoubtedly Lawfull to Exact Complyance under Pain or Military Execution. And Countreys in the Power of an Ennemy for the most part are so well apprised of what they have to Expect that they never refuse such Contributions or Supplys.

2 — Every Person that is Found in Arms is Supposed to Resist & may be proceeded against accordingly. And Every House from which Hostilitys are Committed may be destroyd & is accordingly destroyed to deterr the Peasant from Practices that Approach to assassination & hurt particular persons without affecting the General Cause.

3 — An Army being to Withdraw from a Countrey or being to leave it to be occupied by an ennemy may if Expedient not only break up high Ways  demolish Bridges. Fell Timber. Destroy Forrage Provisions, & every Species of accommodation that would facilitate the operations of An Ennemy. This is Practised by Armys on the own Territory of a Friend & the Right was never Questioned on that of an Ennemy.

When a Party at War is to Abandon a Possession that may be instantly turned against him by an Ennemy, it is undoubtedly lawfull to consult his own Safety by destroying Such Possession.

Thus not only Arsenals & Magazines with their Contents of Arms Amunition stores and Provisions. Not only Fortresses Docks & Harbours but Sea Ports of any description [xxx] Towns & Villages are destroyed when they are likely to become a dangerous Accession of Force to an Ennemy.

And the Party who persists in the Wrong so  long as to render those or Other Acts of Hostility necessary against him has no one to Blame but himself.

If The Party whose Right is withheld from him, abstain, upon Considerations of Humanity or Prudence, from such Severitys; this conduct depends upon his own Choice & cannot be exacted from him by any Strict Rule of Justice.

On the Contrary Justice to the Cause in which he is engaged may frequently make it necessary for him to proceed so far.

These Maxims of War have not been practised much less Abused in the general Conduct of the American War.

Accidental outrages take place without making any Part in the Plans or Systems of Hostilitys.

The Plan of the War seems to have been formed upon an Idea that we  were engaged in a Contest with our Brethren to be reclaimed by the mildest Possible Methods, That their Armys were to be defeated but their Persons and Property Spared. No contributions were exacted, No Markets were forced, The Peasant lived undisturbed within Reach of our Guns Cannon & denyed us that Relief & those Supplys which a Single discharge could have forced, or Amply punished him for refusing.

Must Great Britain forego every Right that is not to be recovered upon such Maxims of Lenity or rather Timidity as these?—If so Every Obstinate Ennemy or Rebel may forever with hold her Rights.

But the American Rebels must not be flatterd.

Every Species of War that is lawfull against an ordinary Ennemy is lawfull against them. 

And as the Passions of men are more Violent in Civil and Domestic than in Forreign Wars, The Obstinate American Rebel who professes to throw himself into the Scale of France, against his own Countrey, has more Severitys to dread from his Injured Countrey than any Forreign Ennemy would have to dread in the result of an Ordinary War.

The Congress now Usurping the Government in America & Violently restraining the People from returning to their Allegiance & Duty, Intend the deepest Wound that ever was aimed at Great Britain, and appea[r]s to be Animated with peculiar Sentiments of Animosity & Rancour.

The Consequences of their Pretensions to Independence, Are the Dissmemberment of the British Empire by a Separation of the whole Continent of North America from the  Crown of Great Britain: The Consequent Exclusion of Great Britain from the Naval Resources which she had with so much Care Studyed to acquire with so much care on the Other Side of the Atlantic. Her Exclusion in time of War time   at least from the Parts of the Atlantic sic become precarious & insecure, & consequently the Danger of her Possession in the West East Indies become equally precarious Insecure, & or a Ready Prey to her Ennemys. And last of all the Eventual transferance of all the Maritime advantages now Enjoyed by Great Britain to Her Ennemys.

Whoever therefore sees nothing to be regretd in the Contest now Subsisting with the Rebels in America & in its Consequences, besides  the hardships likely to be Suffered by the American Rebel in Carrying to its full Completion this System of Wrong & Injustice to this Countrey & whoever feels not the wrong the[re]by intended & actually impending to Great Britain: is not, in his Heart, a British Subject but an Alien & an Ennemy.

When it is considered That, if in case the Ennemys of Great Britain whether forreign or Domestic Prevail in this Quarrel, Our Countrey still will be Stript of Possessions [xxx] improved with so much Care; will be deprived of the expected Returns from thence, & reduced to this Single Island, with Towns going to decay And Inhabitants Perishing for want of their former Resources: With a People Enured to Wealth disused to the Virtues,  required what might to Support them in Poverty; & in no Condition to Strugle with the difficulties of so new a Situation; No longer able to mantain such Fleets & Armys for the Defence of her Coasts & therefore an Easy Prey to any forreign Ennemy.

When it is considered, that these are the Evils which we are now Striving to Avert: The Person who now affects to Weep for over the temporary Sufferings which the Americans may now draw on themselves by persisting in this Rebellion, will, it is hoped, change the Object of his Fears or Confess himself to be an Ennemy not a Friend to Great Britain.

This Idle Inquiry has likewise been directed to Cloud the Prospect of Great Britain in Her endeavours to recover  Her Interest in the American Colonies.

Her Difficulties are Exaggerated; Her Forces & her Resources are depreciated & Vilifyed; in order to Support a Character for Ability in the Officer who has been Employed in this Service. And The Empire of Great Britain must be dissmembered rather than we must Suppose any Defect in the Capacity of our General [xxx] who certainly might rise in our Esteem as much by the diffidence which in the world Modesty inspires as by any Pretences to Ability & Superiour Genius but from his failure hitherto to Restore America to its Duty the Obvious Consequence, I hope, is not despair of our Countreys Cause but farther & some different change of Plan exertion.

We must Protect & Support our Friends on that Continent, [xxx] & dissarm our Ennemies.

We must Put our Friends in Possession of Civil Government & reserve the effects of Military Government for our Military dissorders & Severitys our Ennemys.

I do not say mean to insinuate that the Reverse has hitherto been done, experience is not necessary to condemn The Idea Such Proceedings whether real or Supposed.

The Force of Arms is ever but a small part in the great operations of State to restore & to heal a Wounded Community.

The Force of Wisdom & of Justice the Sense of Mutual Interest, directing the Arms that are to be employed against a desperate Faction that has usurped usurping the Government of North America, may soon do more than has yet appeared to be Practised. The mere Military Move has hitherto performed however much tho supposed above Censure have been able to Accomplish.
OF MAN’S PROGRESSIVE NATURE

There is in nature a well-known distinction of things progressive, and stationary, to which we must attend in the farther pursuit of our subject.

To be stationary, it is not necessary that a subject should be incapable of change, even from the action of any external cause; it is sufficient that it have not any principle of change in its own nature. To be progressive, on the contrary, does not consist in any variation or change which an external cause may produce; but in those transitions, from one state to another, which proceed from a principle of advancement in the subject itself.

A block of stone, from the quarry, may receive, in the hands of a workman, any variety of forms, but left to itself, would remain in its state.

A seedling plant on the contrary, in a favourable soil and exposure, takes root and grows of itself.

Progressive natures are subject to vicissitudes of advancement or decline, but are not stationary, perhaps, in any period of their existence. Thus, in [198] the material world, subjects organized being progressive, when they cease to advance, begin to decline, however insensibly, at the time of their transition from one to the other. In this consist the operation or failure of vegetable and animal life. In their advancement, the matter of which they are composed accumulates, and at every period acquires a form that approaches to the end of their progress. The principle of life itself gains strength or ability to discharge, and to vary, the functions of nature. In their decline they fade, shrink, and abate of their vigour and force.

Intelligence appears to be, in a still higher degree, a principle of progression, and subject to greater extremes of comparative advancement or degradation. It is advanced by continual accessions of observation and knowledge; of skill and habit, in the practice of arts; of improving discernment of good and evil; of resolute purpose or power. It declines through defect of memory, discernment, affection, and resolution.

While subjects stationary are described by the enumeration of co-existent parts, and quiescent qualities, subjects progressive are characterized by the enumeration of steps, in the passage from one form or state of existence to another, and by the termination or point of approach, whether near or remote, to which the successive movements of their nature are directed.
[199]

The rank of a progressive subject is to be estimated, not by its condition at any particular stage of its progress, but by its capacity and destination to advance in the scale of being. From the feeblest shoot or seed-leaf of the oak, though more diminutive than many plants of the garden, we already forecast the stately fabric it is designed to raise in the forest. In the human infant, though inferior to the young of many other animals, we anticipate the beauty of youth, the vigorous soul of manhood, and the wisdom of age. And the highest rank, in the scale of created existence, is due to that nature, if such there be, which is destined to grow in perfection, and may grow without end: its good is advancement, and its evil, decline.

We are inclined to consider progression as made up of stationary periods; as we consider a circle as a polygon of an infinite number of sides; a fluid as made up of solid parts indefinitely small; and duration itself, as made up of successive points, or indivisible moments of time.

In this our conception is inaccurate, and our reasoning, of course, likely to become incorrect. Progression may, no doubt, be divided into periods; but in no period, perhaps, is the subject stationary. Every subdivision, like the whole of its progress, is a transition from one state to another, and through states intermediate, more or less numerous according to the divisions under which we are pleased to [200] conceive them. The progress of intelligent being, for instance, may be more or less rapid, but is continual; and in the very continuance of existence, and the repetition of consciousness and perception, must receive continual increments of knowledge and thought. Or in the failure of the source from which it derives improvement, it is likely to incur degradation and decline.

For our purpose, however, it is sufficient to observe, that the state of nature or the distinctive character of any progressive being is to be taken, not from its description at the outset, or at any subsequent stage of its progress; but from an accumulative view of its movement throughout. The oak is distinguishable from the pine, not merely by its seed leaf; but by every successive aspect of its form; by its foliage in every successive season; by its acorn; by its spreading top; by its lofty growth, and the length of its period. And the state of nature, relative to every tree in the wood, includes all the varieties of form or dimension through which it is known to pass in the course of its nature.

By parity of reason, the natural state of a living creature includes all its known variations, from the embryo and the fœtus to the breathing animal, the adolescent and the adult, through which life in all its varieties is known to pass.

The state of nature, relative to man, is also a state of progression equally real, and of greater [201] extent. The individual receives the first stamina of his frame in a growing state. His stature is waxing, his limbs and his organs gain strength, and he himself a growing facility in the use of them. His faculties improve by exercise, and are in a continual state of exertion.

If his thoughts pass from one subject to another, he can return to the subject he has left, with some acquired advantage of discernment or comprehension. He accumulates perceptions and observations, takes cognizance of new subjects, without forgetting the old; knows more, of course, at every subsequent period than he did in a former; reasons more securely; penetrates obscurities, which at first embarrassed him; and performs every operation of thought with more facility and more success.

With respect to the period of his existence he sees it but in part. When he looks back to the point from which he set out, he cannot descry it; when he looks forward to the end of his line, he cannot foresee it. He may observe the birth and the death of a fellow creature, but knows nothing of his own. If he were to assume the earliest date he remembers as the beginning of his existence, he might soon be convinced that he overlooked a considerable period which had preceded; or if he should suppose his being to end with the dissolution of his animal frame, it is possible he might be equally mistaken. Yet he finds nothing in the world around him [202] beyond the limits of what he can collect from the remembrance of the past, or infer by sagacity from the laws of nature in foresight of the future, from which he can fix any certain marks of his own beginning or his end.

Such, without entering into the peculiarities or unequal degrees of power incident to different men, we may assume as the state of nature relative to the individual.

The state of nature relative to the species is differently constituted, and of different extent. It consists in the continual succession of one generation to another; in progressive attainments made by different ages; communicated with additions from age to age; and in periods, the farthest advanced, not appearing to have arrived at any necessary limit. This progress indeed is subject to interruption, and may come to a close, or give way to vicissitude at any of its stages; but not more necessarily at the period of highest attainment than at any other.

So long as the son continues to be taught what the father knew, or the pupil begins where the tutor has ended, and is equally bent on advancement; to every generation the state of arts and accommodations already in use serves but as groundwork for new invention and successive improvement. As Newton did not acquiesce in what was observed by Kepler and Galileo; no more have successive astronomers [203] restricted their view to what Newton has demonstrated. And, with respect to the mechanic and commercial arts, even in the midst of the most laboured accommodations, so long as there is any room for improvement, invention is busy as if nothing had yet been done to supply the necessities, or complete the conveniences of human life. But even here, and in all its steps of progression, this active nature, in respect to the advantages, whether of knowledge or art, derived from others, if there be not a certain effort to advance, is exposed to reverse and decline. The generation, in which there is no desire to know more or practise better than its predecessors, will probably neither know so much nor practise so well. And the decline of successive generations, under this wane of intellectual ability, is not less certain than the progress made under the operation of a more active and forward disposition.

Such is the state of nature relative to the human species; and, in this, as in every other progressive subject, the present being intermediate to the past and the future, may be different from either. Each is a part of the whole; and neither can, with any reason, be said to be more natural than the others. It cannot be said, that it is more natural for the oak to spring from its seed than to overshadow the plain; that it is more natural for water to gush from the land in springs than to flow in rivers, and to mix with the sea.
[204]

The state of nature relative to man, however, is sometimes a mere term of abstraction, in which he is stated apart from the society he forms, from the art he invents, the science he acquires, or the political establishment he makes. And, when his progress in any of these respects is to be considered, it is no doubt convenient to consider the particular in question apart from himself, and from every thing else. It is not, however, to be supposed, that man ever existed apart from the qualities and operations of his own nature, or that any one operation and quality existed without the others. The whole, indeed, is connected together, and any part may vary in measure or degree, while in its nature and kind it is still the same.

The child may be considered apart from his parent, and the parent apart from his child; but the latter would not have existed without the former. If we trace human society back to this its simplest constitution, even there the society was real. If we trace human thought back to its simplest exertions, even there it was an exercise of understanding, and some effort of invention or skill.

The groups in which the rudest of men were placed, had their chiefs and their members; and nothing that the human species ever attained, in the latest period of its progress, was altogether without a germ or principle from which it is derived, in the earliest or most ancient state of mankind.
[205]

It may no doubt be convenient, we may again repeat, in speculation, or in assigning the origin and in deriving the progress of any attainment, to consider the attainment itself abstractly, or apart from the faculty or power by which it is made; and we must not deny ourselves the use of such abstractions, in treating of human nature, any more than in treating of any other subject. But there is a caution to be observed in the use of abstractions, relating to any subject whatever: That they be not mistaken for realities, nor obtruded for historical facts.

The language of geometry is necessarily abstract. A point is mere place, considered apart from any dimension whatever. A line is length, considered apart from breadth or thickness. A surface is length and breadth, considered apart from thickness. And, in a solid, all the dimensions of length, breadth, and thickness, are admitted. But the geometrical abstractions are nowhere mistaken for realities: length is not supposed to exist without breadth, nor length and breadth without thickness. Or, if such mistakes are actually made, yet, no one would infer that lines are more natural than surfaces, or surfaces more natural than solids.

Such mistake and misapprehension of terms is scarcely admitted, except in treating of human nature. In every other progressive subject, progression [206] itself, not any particular step in the progress, is supposed to constitute the natural state. The last shoot of the oak, after it has stood five hundred years in the forest, and carried a thousand branches, is not deemed less natural than the first.

Under this term, of the State of Nature, authors affect to look back to the first ages of man, not without some apparent design to depreciate his nature, by placing his origin in some unfavourable point of view; as we derogate, from the supposed honours of a family, by looking back to the mechanics or peasants, from whom its ancestors were descended.

Hobbes contended, that men were originally in a state of war, and undisposed to amity or peace; that society, altogether unnatural to its members, is to be established and preserved by force. Or this, at least, may be supposed to follow from his general assumption that the state of nature was a state of war.

If this point must be seriously argued, we may ask in what sense war is the state of nature? Not surely the only state of which men are susceptible; for we find them at peace as well as at war: nor can we suppose it the state which mankind ought at all times to prefer; for it labours under many inconveniences and defects. But it was, we may be told, the first and the earliest state, from which men were relieved by convention and adventitious establishments.
[207]

This assertion, that war was the earliest state of mankind, is made without proof; for the first ages of the human species, in times past, are as little known as the last, that may close the scene of its being in times to come. In every progression, it is true, may be conceived a point of origin, and a point of termination, to be collected from the direction in which the progress proceeds. The sun, even by a person who never saw him rise or set, may be supposed, from the course he holds, to have risen in the east, and to set in the west. Man, who is advancing in knowledge and art, may be supposed to have begun in ignorance or rudeness; but it is not necessary to suppose that a species, of whom the individuals are sometimes at war, and sometimes at peace, must have begun in war. There is, on the contrary, much reason to suppose, that they began in peace, and continued in peace, until some occasion of quarrel arose between them.

The progress of the species, in population and numbers, implies an original peace, at least, between the sexes, and between the parent and his child, in family together; and, if we are to suppose a state of war between brothers, this, at least, must have been posterior to the peace in which they were born and brought up, to the peace in which they arrived at the possession of those talents, and that force, which they come to employ for mutual destruction.
[208]

Another philosopher, in this school of nature, has chosen to fix the original description of man, in a state of brutality, unconscious of himself, and ignorant of his kind; so far from being destined to the use of reason, that all the attempts he has made at the exercise of this dangerous faculty have opened but one continual source of depravation and misery.

But, as the former of these philosophers has not told us what beneficent power, different from man himself, has made peace for this refractory being; no more has the other informed us, who invented reason for man; whose thoughts and reflections first disturbed the tranquillity of his brutal nature, and brought this victim of care into this anxious state of reflection, to which are imputed so many of his follies and sufferings.

Until we are told by whom the state of nature was done away, and a new one substituted, we must continue to suppose that this is the work of man himself; and the whole of what these shrewd philosophers have taught, amounts to no more than this, that man would be found in a state of war, or in a state of brutality, if it were not for himself, for his own qualifications and his endeavours to obtain a better; and that, in reality, the situation he gains is the effect of a faculty by which he is disposed to choose for himself.

This we are ready to admit. Man is made for [209] society and the attainments of reason. If, by any conjuncture, he is deprived of these advantages, he will sooner or later find his way to them. If he came from a beginning, defective in these respects, he was, from the first, disposed to supply his defects; in process of time has actually done so; continued to improve upon every advantage he gains; and thus to advance, we may again repeat, is the state of nature relative to him.

It were absurd to think of depreciating a progressive being, by pointing out the state of defect, from which he has passed, to the attainment of a better and a higher condition; for so to pass is the specific excellence of his nature.

The grandeur of the forest is not the less real, for its having sprung up from among the weeds of the field: the genius of Newton not the less to be admired, for his having grown up from the ignorance and simplicity of his infant years: nor the policy of Athens, Sparta, or Rome, less to be valued, because they may have sprung from hordes, no way superior to those who are now found in different parts of Africa or America.

It is the nature of progression to have an origin, far short of the attainments which it is directed to make; and not any precise measure of attainment, but the passage or transition from defect to perfection is that which constitutes the felicity of a progressive nature. The happy being, accordingly, [210] whose destination is to better himself, must not consider the defect under which he labours, at the outset, or in any subsequent part of his progress, as a limit set to his ambition, but as an occasion and a spur to his efforts.

The life and activity of intelligent beings consists in the consciousness or perception of an improveable state, and in the effort to operate upon it for the better. This constitutes an unremitting principle of ambition in human nature. Men have different objects, and succeed unequally in the pursuit of them: but every person, in one sense or another, is earnest to better himself.

Man is by nature an artist, endowed with ingenuity, discernment, and will. These faculties he is qualified to employ on different materials; but is chiefly concerned to employ them on himself: over this subject his power is most immediate and most complete; as he may know the law, according to which his progress is effected, by conforming himself to it, he may hasten or secure the result.

The bulk of mankind are, like other parts of the system, subjected to the law of their nature, and, without knowing it, are led to accomplish its purpose: while they intend no more than subsistence and accommodation or the peace of society, and the safety of their persons and their property, their faculties are brought into use, and they profit by [211] exercise. In mutually conducting their relative interests and concerns, they acquire the habits of political life; are made to taste of their highest enjoyments, in the affections of benevolence, integrity, and elevation of mind; and, before they have deliberately considered in what the merit or felicity of their own nature consist, have already learned to perform many of its noblest functions.

Nature in this as in many other instances does not entrust the conduct of her works to the precarious views and designs of any subordinate agent. But if the progress of man in every instance were matter of necessity or even of contingency, and no way dependent on his will, nor subjected to his command, we should conclude that this sovereign rank and responsibility of a moral agent with which he is vested were given in vain; and the capacity of erecting a fabric of art, on the foundation of the laws of nature, were denied to him in that department precisely in which they are of the highest account. If he may work on the clay that is placed under his foot, and form it into models of grace and beauty; if he may employ the powers of gravitation, elasticity, and magnetism, as the ministers of his pleasure; we may suppose, also, that the knowledge of laws operating on himself should direct him how to proceed, and enable him to hasten the advantages, to which his progressive [212] nature is competent. If his Maker have destined his faculties to improve by exercise, and by the attainment of habits, there is no doubt that he himself may choose what exercise he will perform, and what habits he shall acquire.

But in order to profit by the laws of progression which take place in his frame, it behoves him to recollect what they are, and to take his resolution respecting the purpose to which he will apply their force.

To this object, he is urged at once by the double consideration of a good to be obtained, and of an evil to be avoided. Most subjects in nature, which, from the energy of a salutary principle, are susceptible of advancement, are likewise, by the failure or abuse of that principle, susceptible of degradation and ruin. Plants and animals are known to perish, in the same gradual manner in which they advance into strength and beauty. Man, with whom the sources of good and of evil are more entrusted to his own management, is likewise exposed, in a much higher degree, to the extremes of comparative degradation and misery. The progress of nations in one age to high measures of intellectual attainment and cultivated manners is not more remarkable than the decline that sometimes ensues in their fall to extreme depravation and intellectual debility.

It may not be in the power of the individual [213] greatly to promote the advancement or to retard the decline of his country. But every person, being principally interested in himself, is the absolute master of his own will, and for the choice he shall have made is alone responsible.
