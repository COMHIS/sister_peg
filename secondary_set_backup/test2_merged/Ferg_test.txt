V. AN EXCURSION IN THE HIGHLANDS : DISCOURSE ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS 

of Oedipus than he des of any family in Atholl afterwards repeated this acc as a trait of the manners in the highlands, I know your author. Walking, he pretends to be a wag and laughs at your Lowlander for their Ignorance & want of Speech, and seeing where My Visitors indeed were delighted with the Aspect of the Country its Rivers Hills & Woods your Question pointed would not baulk your Credulity your Lowlanders he has often said to me will believe any thing. To prove are mankind to interpret a difference of any kind against foreigners and in their own favour. I am not sure but the most ured are the most apt  Spy Barbarity in every thing different from themselves. And something like the Chineze Map of the world is to be found in every European head. My Friends however were not insensible to the Natural Beauties of the Country.
Its Woods Waters Lofty Hills & Precipices and my heart overflowed with pleasure in a Company to which I was so much attached from & in whom I had taken my first Draughts of Moral Science.
Having already Rode or Walked through every Road or by Path among the Woods & the Banks of the River, We agreed one Evening that next day we should Ascend the mountains & enjoy a Pleasure which I had often talked of to them of sauntering amidst. The Solemnity of Lone & Empty Vales among the mountains with nothing to be seen but heath towering hills & Majestic Rock & not a Sound but that of the Whittering Plower or Moor Cock when he spring the Heath.
But that we might appear to have some method in our Walks & not pass for madmen in the Countr I undertook to Arm them all with some sort of Guns & procure a Dog to give us the Appearance of Sportsmen. The Scheme being formed overnight all of  were dressed for the Mountain about four o’Clock in the morning at a Signal which I was appointed to give by firing off my piece under the Window  the Place where they Slept. And we accordingly Sett off with a Gilly whitfoot with a bag of Provisions to Stay hunger which never fails to make itself very intensely felt through the day in Such excursion.
We had scarcely turned the Brow of the first Hill & lost sight of the Strath we had left and all its Vestige of human habitation when we fell in with one of those Sportsmen who are called Stalkers & live by the most fatiguing & tiresome of all pursuits that of the Deer whose Vigilance & Wary & shyness can baffle the hunters skill for Weeks to get within Shot of them. This person was my acquaintance & he undertook to Conduct us where we might me with Sport. My Low Country friends thought it became them as persons  come from a wild Country to complain of those rugged Assents & Barbarous Regions & but for shame some of them 
would have thrown their Guns being little used to Such implements of Sport. Our friend the Stalker indeed was very much puzled what to make of us for tho he put two or three Coveys in different places. The Birds were allowed to go unmolested. His own Gun was loaded with Ball & he did not deign to fire at a Bird, and my Friends continued the dissputes which they got into while the game Sprung from their feet. I was myself no shot & tho I fired once or twice killed nothing. I led the way however to a Spring & Rivulet with which I was well acquainted & where I proposed we should take some Rest and Refreshment. The doubting that our bag might no be very plenty Stalker took a different way towards a Shealing from which he said he would meet us round hill with some Supply of Milk & what else the Shealing could Supply. We had accordingly scarce got sight of our Rivulet when our Friend appeared accompanyed with a herdsman & two young women carrying Pitchers of Milk Cream & Why with Barley Cakes of the most delicious , as every one of the Company owned at this time,
tho at any other perhaps they would scarcely have tasted such fare. My Friend Adam while he devourd the Cakes & the Milk held up his hands & exclaimed that whoever could not fend on such fare should be taken out and Shot. And here is luxury said Cleghorn stretching himself on the green bank of this Rivulet which no Sopha even surpassed.
I was in haste this morning to know what sort of pleasure Sportsmen could have in killing poor birds. But I might have lay still in my bed for all I have learned. So you might for I don’t think you so much as looked at the Dog or cocked your Gun once Wilkie & you could have settled your disputes just as well at the Breakfast Table as among these Hills. And he would not have lost his Powder Horn as I am told he has done.
What is more says Wilkie I should not have worn out a good pair of Shoes which cost me a Boll of Pease at Christmas.
Nay, says R. Adam if they have lasted from Christmas till now at Midsummer there is not much to be said against the pleasure of shooting.
Shooting I said is like many of our other pleasures consists in the excercise it gives to our Skill & our faculties as well as our limbs. My wonder is says Cleghorn that so lazy an Animal as man should take it in his head to have his bones broken for diversion. A Country Squire will risk his neck at any time rather than be quiet in his bed. Hunting in this Country is laborious and hazardous: but what was when the Game was a Boar or Lyon. These are publick enemies says Home And every lover of Arms must be keen to encounter them. Yes when he could not avoid them I said: but to put himself in their Way on purpose does not appear to be very reasonable. If we did nothing but what reason prescribes we should pass but a dull life in my Opinion. There is reason for you says he turning to Cleghorn who seemed to be falling asleep. I heard what you say, said Cleghorn But I had rather be left alone with the pratling of this little Brook. 
Are you now to learn that mans life must pass in Action whether with or without reason And his very best enjoyment are in the Nature of passing Scenes not fixed Acquisitions or possessions. He had Scarcely Spoke these words when our Stalker in a hasty & menacing kind of whisper called Close. Then pointing to Windward with his face almost touching the Ground. We Spyed a Stag coming at Speed over a height beyond us. We have the Wind of him said the Stalker and if I but get a shot you will not want Venison here this eight days. z For your Life says Cleghorn dont shoot him I would not forgo the pleasure of seeing him pass for all the Venison in your Dukes Forrest. The Animal was soon near enough to spy his Danger and making a Spring to avoid us, raised a kind of involuntary Shout from all the Company: but the Stalker was Silent & without saying a Word to any of us took his departure. Are you surprised says Cleghorn that Animals should be fond of their own Movements, With what Majesty & Grace he went off tho alarmed for his Life on seeing a Gang of Thieves and Murderers. It was very fine says R. Adam: but I doubt whether he was Conscious of it or meant to show Away. That may be doubted says Cleghorn But who can doubt  that in Nature there is a meaning which Couples the Grace of Action with the Instinctive dissposition to show it. I believe the great difference between Man & the other animals is that they are made to perform their functions Gracefully. Man is all to perceive why he should so perform them:
but left to choose for himself at the hazard of missing the Aim in which Other Animals are for the most part correct. I believe that all Animals says Wilkie do what is agreeable to them & Man among the rest. And if pleasure is so placed as to Misslead them. The Arrangement of Nature is defective not the Animal that conform himself to the Law of his Nature.
Certainly so says Cleghorn with Respect to Animals who have no power of discernment beyond the present impression: But in respect to Man who not only like the other animals is occasionally sollicited by different Pleasures: but who at all times, whatever the present impression may be can recollect & State the whole sum of considerations on which he is to Act. If he neglect to do or make a wrong choice in the face of better information The defect is in him not in the scene whi nature has opened for his Choice & exertions. It is expected of him that he shall chuse that which upon the whole is constituent of most pleasure & least pain taking in the whole of time the past the Present & the Future. What a Mighty Vista you would open says Adam for so short sighted a Creature. It is so no doubt said Cleghorn And neither the very sudden occasion on which he is Often to make his Choice nor the extent of his views enable  to Act upon this principle alone. But there is another Principle neither requiring so much deliberation nor such extensive views on which he may Act with Tolerable Safety & is probably that to which Nature has trusted his Conduct. And I need not say that this is the distinguishing principle of right & Wrong Innocent & Guilt Honour & disshonour or by whatever name the Estimable & Praiseworthy disstinguished from the blameable & Vile.
I am affraid says Wilkie that we are not always correct in the Application of this Principle any more than the Former. Absolute Correction says Cleghorn is no where our lot. But in the Application of this Principle I believe we are safer than in that of any other. And less Evil is incurred by those who do what they believe to be their duty than by those who study nothing but pleasure or Interest however well pondered & calculated. In our deliberations indeed upon every Principle we must decline present Enjoyment for future Considerations but I believe we are more effectually Supported in acting thus through Sentiments of Integrity & honour than any mere consideration of future Interest or Safety. I even doubt whether it be correct to Say that the Man of Integrity upon any occasion forgos a Pleasure to persevere in his duty for to him I believe this very perseverance is the Supreme pleasure on every Occasion. And if Nature have taught him and all Other Animals to pursue his their pleasure She has not neglected to Mark the proper Object of his Choice.
Other Pleasures have their Separate & Absolute value whatever it may.
This of doing right derives me a possible Pleasure from the comparable neglect of every other one.
Virtue it should seem by this account to be the greatest Pleasure And the Systems of Epicurus & Zeno were the same. Just so he said all to the mere order of Words & the possible mistakes a traveller may commit in setting out from one end of the Road he is to Travel or The Other.
Epicurus says that Pleasure is the Chief Good.
Zeno says that Virtue his Chief Good is Supremely pleasant.
Here the only difference seems to be that the Adjective & Substantive are differently placed. Strange that so slight a difference should have occasioned so much Controversy or that in the effect there should be any difference.
What difference can it make in the Effect says R. Adam. It may make some Answerd Cleghorn. The Epicurean says Pleasure is the chief Good & leaves his Pupils to chuse their pleasure, many of them I’m affraid will take the first that Comes Altho he owns that Virtue is the highest yet many who set out in the pursuit of Pleasure may never Arrive at Virtue.
According to Zeno The Choice is at once directed to Virtue and all inferiour pleasure are sett aside in the Effort to arrive at this.
If according to Epicurus himself there be a choice of Pleasures the very meaning of a Formula in Stating the Chief Good is the Specification of that which is the preferable pleasure. And if retitude & Integrity of mind be that pleasure Common sense requires that it should be Specifyed be its Name Virtue Moral Excellence or any Other.
I am affraid says Wilkie that if the World is to be governed by the Choice of Names we have little to expect from Philosophy at least.
C I am not very Sanguine in my expectations. But of the Principles of Action in human Nature allowing that pleasure of one kind or other is the gratification of all. It is of consequence at least in speculation to know.
That the Principle of Estimation in the human mind is at least one of the strongest and its gratifications of the greatest value.
W What a Mysterious and Indefineable Principle you open upon us. And Plato himself I believe with his One in Many or his many in one could hardly make Sense of it. What is it? Vanity Ambition or Pride.
The fashionable point of humour Dress or Beauty Politeness Education Science Fortune or birth or any thing else which mankind affect to set themselves off.
C It is indeed none of these exclusively: but all of them springing from one Source of which the Waters in its very first ishue into different Channels is instantly sweet or bitter, Clear or foul poisonous or Salutary.
R. Adam. What a wonderful Spring. One must take care where he tastes it or rather a tasting at one channel can give no notion of what it is at another.
W. C Just so a person who has tasted only of Integrity & just Elevation of mind will not know what the Proud or Vainglorious Enjoy or Suffer.
R. A Yet all this you say comes from One Spring. I wish you would show it us.
W. C Ferguson there will show it. He has often told me it is the point at which all that is forcible in the human Mind is Collected. The Honest Mans Integrity The Gentlemans honour which neither will forgo to preserve his Life The Soldiers Glory for which life is exposed a thousand times and often Sacrificed. It is the Martyrs Crown which renders Suffering indifferent or a matter of Joy and Triumph. Whoever can direct the Channel in which it is to Run may command Mankind to any Purpose or to any extent.
R. A This is still no better than leaving us to grope for the Point over an amazing extent of Surface. For in what point do the Plain honest Man & Integrity Military Glory or Religious Enthusiasm agree.
Fer. There are Forms or Characters for differing human Nature from mere integrity & honour such as Emulation, Pride & Vanity and yet I believe they are derived from one common source whose water in flowing in any of its Streams are bitter Altho the source from which they are derived is Swe
A What for a source is that?
Fer To drop the Metaphor It is a certain disposition to Esteem the Excellent or Perfect in contradisstinction to Imperfection or defect. In what relates to our own attainments I would call it Ambition. A term in common use for the most limited to the desire of Power. But according to the definition which is given of it in our Dictionary Viz. The desire of something higher & better than the present We may venture to call the desire of Excellence Ambition As we call the Love of Animal Pleasure Sensuality.
Ambition then in this sense is that Polarity of the Human Soul which gives it a direction horizontal or rather Elevated to what is Esteemable As sensuality like what befalls the dipping needle tends to ascension or depression.
Johnson defines it not the desire of Power: but the desire of something higher & better than the present. This implys at least a distinction of high & low to which in our mind Correspond sentiments of Esteem & Contempt & what may be termed a Species of Polaty in human Nature ever pointing to the Esteemed or the Estimable And away from the Contemned or Contemptible with as many different Appearances as their are things in which the distinction of Excellence And defect can in imagination be applyed.
The F. If I have ever ventured to say anything to you on this Subject it could be little more than a repetition of what I had learned from yourself and Water is better from the Fountain than from any Vessel in which it has  kept any time.
W. If you toss the subject in compliments from one to the Other we had better be after the Deer that might have  shot for our Dinner when we might have more Patience to listen to Speculations. Here are three or four of us something to do with the Arts that contribute to Pleasure as well as Profit. And if each will Specify what he Aims at. For Beauty in his Way we may possibly find some Point in which to agree.
H. Whether you agree or not we may at least part good Friends. I do not wish to end the dispute at once. But my faith is pinned on Bob Adam. I shall desire no other account of Beauty than what he will gi
A. In our Profession we have less to do with Beauty than People imagine. We must humour our employers. They have each Crotchets and think only how they may be lodged at the least Expence.
D. H. Now this to me is the very summit of Beauty Utility in which every one is entitled to judge for himself. Will any one lay out his money on what he does not want or is of no use to him.
R. A. I am not so unreasonable as to think he should: But Still Beauty is a proper Object for the Rich: but if any one with money in his Pocket should Prefer a Lump of Mere Mason to the Pantheon or Collonade of a Grecian Building he might be well enough lodged within But the outside of his Mansion would Argue little Taste or Spirit.
D. H What would you have our monied People do in this Respect.
R. A The Remains of Antiquity Even Pieces of Cornices & Broken Columns will show them what they ought to do.
D. H Even in the Stile of Antient Building I believe it is acknowledged that the ornaments or the Beauty of Parts is derived from apparent utility and the ornaments are but apparent Supports or strength of the Building and hence the great Superiority of the Grecian to the Gothic Architecture.
A. F This I believe is true and in this point of View. An Edifice is Beautiful in the same Sense in which any other work well Contrived in the means for a beneficent End is admired as a Beauty.
D. H. A Beneficent End and Apt means are only so many more words to Express utility.
A. F. Such a Work no doubt is Useful but if Utility be the sole Recommendation of what is Called Beautiful. It should follow that utility whever found shall have the same Effect And a Dunghill be more Admired than the Pantheon of Agrippa or the Dome of St Peters.
D. H. I grant you that Utility without art or Design especially if it offend our other Senses is not admitted for Beauty.
A. F It is not mere utility then but utility Obtained by design that Constitutes Beauty. And if a Beneficent Design or Beneficent Ends & wise means even when they are not of any Actual use to any one as in the Pantheon of Agrippa are admired as Beautiful and if Actual Utility is sometimes Observed with disgust it follows that the order of Salutary Ends & Wise Means is the Genuine Constituent of Beauty And while we bestow encomiums on the work it is only the workmen we admire.
W. W. We have let the Deer Escape and I suspect we must let the Game you are in pursuit of Escape also. It is too nimble I doubt for our Speculations. In trying to catch it we lay hold of some block or heap of baggage that ly in the Way. What connection can Beauty the mistress of Fancy and lively conceit have with Utility the dullest of all considerations or with great schemes of Contrivance however beneficent. This is mere plodding and puzle not the gay aspect of Beauty. Beauty has always appeared to me a Matter of Surface & Delight not of internal Solidity or Depth of thought. A Pair of tools bespatterd with Dirt should be beautyful because of the Use they were of in keeping a traveller clean And a Steam Engine should be beautiful because of its purpose and exquisite Contrivance but no Gentleman would like to have such a Beauty seen from his Windows wherever it may be placed for use he endeavours to Lose it from the sight. So much for Useful & well contrived things which have no Beauty. Show me then a Beauty which has these qualities of Utility or Design. What is the Use or Design of a Tulip or a Rose perhaps among the first Specimens of Beauty which ought to have occurred to your Inquiry if you had not been misled by the Sprightly bouncing of a Stag who mistook you for hunters of Venison of which notwithstanding his appearance he may be at this season but an indifferent specimen. Beauty is mere outside and too often but covers defects.
W. C. In that W you are surely right. Beauty is often an Apparent Recommendation & often detected not to be real. Yet it may be apparent Utility or Apparent ingenuity. For no one contends that it must always be the Reality of Either.
W. W. I repeat my question respecting the apparent as well as the Real Utility or Contrivance. What is the Apparent use or Contrivance of a Rose or a Tulip. Do not we say that Tint or this Note of Music is beautiful.
No one ever denyed that Hogarths line is more beautiful than the Zig Zag of a Sawe. That a Circle is more beautiful than any angular Figure yet here is no appearance of Use or Design.
A. F. It is possible we may be disputing about Words. They are seldom so well fixed to a precise meaning as not to occasion an apparent difference of opinion even where there is none. We apply the term beauty frequently to whatever delights or pleases us & it is certain that the sources of Pleasure are to us so various that they ought not to be confounded under the same . Mere sensation is pleasant without any regard to its external cause. We have other pleasures constituted in a sentiment of Esteem or admiration in regard to the merit or excellence of an object. I taste or smell the flavour or fragrance of a Fruit or Flower but I admire an amiable Character. Here too is delight or Pleasure but there is merit in the object as well as satisfaction to me. I would confine the appellation of Beauty to cases of Esteem or Admiration and withhold it from all cases of mere pleasant Sensation.
There is yet another source of Ambiguity in the Terms we employ on this. There are some things in their own Nature agreeable or Admirable:
Others are so only by association with something else. A Fine Morning or Evening is pleasant in itself. The Rise of the Curtain at the Playhouse is pleasant on account of the Entertainment expected to follow. Many Instances now mentioned of very Simple or indifferent things to which the Epithet of Beauty is applied owed to some Association casual or founded in some Slight Analogy Certain pleasing affections of the mind Are associated with notes of Music or tints of Colour and the very terms in which we express our Sense of Beauty in such Instances point out its Source. A Note or Tint is Gay or Sorrowful that is to say it is associated in our Fancy with Joy or sorrow and because the Beautiful is pleasant we say that such Sensations are beautiful.
I would however limit the Appellation of Beauty to such Cases as bear the association not to mere pleasure but to somewhat in its Nature Estimable or admirable And I doubt that in all merely Corporeal Subjects to which the Epithet of Beautiful is applied the title is founded in some such association. What is the Beauty of Certain Expressions of the Countenance but the Characters of Innocence Good Sense and Candour which they bear to the observer. Nay what is the Countenance And the Person himself but the Work of a Divine artist. For since I place Beauty among the Subjects not of mere Sensation but of Esteem admiration & even Extasy I do not fear to ascend too high penetrate too far in Search of its origin.
W. C. You are going now where I have long Wished to go with Plato to the Idea of first Fair & first Perfect derived from the Majesty of God himself and by him impressed on the minds of Intelligent beings.
W. W. We have heard much of Words & their Ambiguity on this occasion. I wish some one would tell us the meaning of these.
W. C. I can tell you only the Sense in which I take them myself And it is no more than this.
That the Almighty in superadding Intelligence to the Animal & Sensitive nature of Man gave him the Power of discriminating Excellence & Defect and Under the Disstinction of becoming acquainted with that Perfection which is Eternal & without Limit that is without Defect for whatever is short of Infinity is Defective so much that in finite or Created Being The least Defect is the greatest Attainable Perfection.
D. H. Do you think that no Power but that of Intelligence alone is required for this Purpose.
W. C. I know not any other.
W. W. What not know of the Moral Sense The Sense of Beauty; the Sense of Ridicule and so forth. Understanding or Intelligence is employed in discovering Truth or refuting Error. But in judging of Merit or Demerit there is Sensation as well as Reasoning.
W. C. It may be so: but if any one should tell me he understood that the Sun was placed nearly in the Center of the Planetary System but that he was not qualified to Judge whether it was wisely so placed. I confess I should question his understanding or Intellectual Faculty: but this after all is but a dispute about Words.
The Moral Sense or the Sense of Right and Wrong is a term like many other metaphorical Expressions familiar in common it is nevertheless a mere metaphor and as Metaphors frequently do tends to misslead our Conception. We are not indeed told of any Internal organs like those of the Eye or the Ear. But as Sensation whether of Colour or Sound is very different from its Cause We are apt to imagine that the Approbation of Virtue has the same arbitrary connection with Virtue that Sound has with the Tremour of a String or Bell. This with me is an objection to the use of such Metaphorical Language. It is the tremour of a Chord that produces the sensation of Sound. But it is the Thing itself that produces the Approbation of Benevolence.
W. W. Benevolence Im affraid is an affection as little known to some people as the Tension and Vibration of Chords required to a musical note is known to others.
W. C. People are no doubt unequally disposed to it but there are few if any who do not in some or on some occasions experience it.
W. W. The Question at present however is not concerning the Reality of Moral Distinctions: but that of mere Beauty and Deformity or Uglyness. This Sentiment may be produced by something abroad in its own Nature indifferent. It is found in Stocks and Stones no less than in living Creatures: But on this question if this were a proper time and place I should wish to proceed more regularly than we have yet done. The Question may be divided into two.
1st What is in the Nae or Form of Things that thus affects the Observer of Beauty.
2d By what faculty in the Observer this Perception or Sentiment is Obtained.
To the first Question some Answerers have said That Beauty consists in Uniformity amidst Variety. Others that it consists in mere form in gently flowing Lines & Surfaces.
The first appears to place Beauty in mere Contradiction. Uniformity contradicts Variety & Variety contradicts Uniformity. The Error however may be in the terms not in the Substance. If in Stead of Uniformity we Substitute Analogy The terms will be consistent. Analogy is Consistent with Variety And this of course with analogy and such indeed is the Scene of Nature exhibiting variety almost indefinite through which however there is still analogy that seems to Argue The Identity of Genius in the Great Inventor of all Living Natures whether Vegetable Animal or Intellectual having their origin in a seminal Germ have their progress to Maturity and Period of Life in the Individual But in the Race are continued by successive & renewed Generation. And the scene is undoubtedly Beautiful: but whether is so from its Mere Variety and Analogy may be doubted. These circumstances may be conceived to take place in scenes of which the effect will be quite the reverse.
Suppose for Instance of Torture but Analogous in the manner of their Application by Machinery or by Fire. The Hell produced with all variety & Analogy would be a Scene of Horror and Detestation not of Delight or Admiration. It is therefore not the mere Analogy of Various Classes and orders of things that Constitutes their Beauty, But the Beneficent Intention that appears throughout and still appears in all the Variation of unexhaustible Invention.
The Gently flowing & bending line or Surface of the Ingenious Artist Hogarth has something childish that would tempt us to believe he never looked for Beauty beyond the Folliage which decorates the Frame of a Picture. In Architure the Streight line and plane Surface are as Necessary to Beauty as foliage is to the Festoon, or a Serpentine Walk to the Pleasure.
Give Hogarths line of Beauty to the Column & his Waving Surface to his pavement in the Portico. I imagine his Beauty will disgust or offend the Taste it is meant to Gratify. These and every other Instance it is Propriety the Child of ingenious and beneficent Desire we admire not any capricious variety or unmeaning combination of Parts.
W. W. I am affraid if we allow you to go on you will bring us to combination and means: the Serious we beg you to damp or sadden or damp a Speculation on which Boys & Girls might be employed with delight.
A. F. The Consequence does not deter me for I am without the that there is no Excellence real or supposed and would limit the use to Subjects of Esteem and admiration.
W. W. We shall not quarrel with you about Words provided you help us to understand their meaning. But I doubt Excellence or Perfection as you sometimes call it will puzle us as much as Beauty itself.
A. F. It is that for which in our Esteem is preferred to another.
W. W. I know what is in our Esteem But it does not follow that in Nature there is any Such Thing.
A. F. Do you think there is no Gradation in the scale of Nature.
W. W. As we conceive there is but as things are I cannot conceive what it should be Things are in unequal Demand in our Market but our Demand & our Esteem are all Creations of our own Heads. There is neither Esteem Demand or Market in the System of Nature. In Nature every thing is in Demand Otherwise it would not have been there And Soil in greater demand than Diamond or Gold otherwise it would not have been more plentiful. Our Demand is so much the Reverse of Nature that ours increases as that of Nature diminishes. And so we erect a Scale the Reverse of that which Nature has adopted.
A. F. If the Demand of Nature is to be measurd by the quantity she has produced so is ours & by that Rule The Soil on which we trade is more in demand that is occupied by Thousands where Diamond is never thought of. But nothing is more in demand than Happiness and you will own that in the Nature of Things it is preferable to Misery And if so you will own that in Scale of Being Happiness is a most real and important distinction.
A. F. That distion most assuredly is real but like the Others it’s in the mind of the Observer.
Is the mind of the Observer no part in the System of Nature. I imagine that great as the System of Nature is Mind is predominant and Being without mind altogether indifferent or not Susceptible of any Distinction whatever.
W. W. That there may be Gradation of Happiness I do not deny:
but how will this Assist you in Establishing a Gradation of Perfection or Excellence.
A. F. The Gradation of Excellence is Established If Happiness & Perfection be the same.
W. W. Did you never know an Excellent Person Suffering under Misfortune or Disease.
A. F. Man is a kind of Mixt or Amphibious Nature, we cannot begin the Scale of Gradation from him he partakes so much both of what is above him & below him that we must had both under our View before we can denounce him truly.
W. W. Begin then where you please. I shall not interrupt you.
A. F. In describing a Scale we may begin at Bottom & Ascend or at Top & descend. Which order is best I shall not say but either is better than beginning at the midle which in fact will be best understood at last after both extreams are contrasted to one Another. To give Existence any Value Power must be Supposed and even Power can scarcely be Conceived to Exist with Exertion and both are indifferent untill it be known to what End-All these bring. Supposed Gradation will Ensue from the Measure of Power And Energy & from the Value of that End proved and Obtained.
Let the Top & Bottom of our Scale then be considered upon this Principle of Estimation. At the Bottom of our Scale we have mere Corporeall Substance or Still Matter. Here however there is Power The Power to resist or withstand any changes. The Vis Inertiae. If this were the Sole Power in Being it must have remaind forever without Exertion. But there is in Fact a Power to change & the Resistance of matter Appears. A Power to coagulate termed Gravitation or Cohesion. The Exertions of this Power would soon terminate in Mass Universal & Still immensity the same as for Existence or Death. There is however a Saving Power by which Coagulation is sufferd to proceed a Certain length and Spheres of different Dimensions are Formed. They do not Rest but Gravitating towards each other are so urged by a Lateral Power of Motion as to revolve in Orbits instead of Running into Mass. And among a Number  Globes the Heavyest of all or nearest the Center is found to have a Salutary Influence on all around it.
Here then or in other analogous Instances The Observer begins to Observe a Purpose transcending the best of his own. The Same Order of things as far as we can discern or Conjecture prevails throughout the immensity of Space & we but exhaust our feeble Powers in the attempt to conceive it. Design Wisdom Goodness Magnificence all crowd upon the feeble Conception. And our thoughts are hurried at once from the Bottom of the Scale we are in Search of to a boundless tract of Existence beyond its Summit. We are placed where Being seemingly begins and Ends And look back from Effect to Cause And to Cause preceeding Cause. But feel in the End that if there were not a first there could not be a Succession & to be first is the same thing as to have been forever & because it was Necessary & Could not have been Otherwise. Where all is order The First Cause or Principle of Existence must have been the Principle of order its Power directed by Goodness & Wisdom. These then it seems are in Being, Consequently boundless in Measure or Extent: If Power be necessary it must be omnipotence. If Wisdom & Goodness they must be perfect.
W. W. But what are we who thus presume to reason every Depart of Nature however remote or exalted above our Reach.
A. F. We are not the lowest & probably much less nearest the Summit in this Scale of Being we are considering but we too are a constituted Power not the least Eminent and indeed that which alone gives value to Existence The Power to be happy.
W. W. And to be miserable.
A. F. Happiness is the Object of all Intelligent Being and the Power of Intelligence is bent to suffer is passive & imbecil the Reverse or defect of Power not a Modification of it. In our Way to Happiness Facts & the Estimate of things are highly interesting & we are not in any Instance precluded from the use of Reason in guarding against mistake or Errors And our Faculties improve by Exercise And the very Form of our Existence is progressive. I am not affraid to Offer a Conjecture that the Frame of Nature is presented to our Observation As the Aliment of Intelligence As the Fields on this Globe are Covered with Verdure for the Aliment of Pasturing animals. I am ready to contend that still matter in any form has no Value but in its Relation to living Nature and on this Earth chiefly to the Living and Intelligent Nature of Man. The Huntsman finds his game even on these Barren & Towering mountains and if the Stag were ten times more cautious & swift than his pursuers would find out ways to overtake & seize . The game for Contemplation & Thought is spread overall from the Earth on which we tread to the Gallaxy and the sparkling suns that do but now reach us with their Ray. We may err in the order in which we employ our Thoughts and our opinions be no better than matter for Correction: but we are not out of our way so long as even the mistakes we saw made have still an approach to our End. To the Progress of Intelligence this is peculiar that the experience of Mistake & its consequences lead to the discovery of Truth. We are not therefore to be deterred from the Use of Reason for it is in using it that we render ourselves fit to enter on the higher Scenes of Being to which our progression may lead. This indeed is a Form of Being implying in itself a Scale of Gradation from the Germ in which it originates to the Maturity or indefinite height of its possible attainments. And in this Comparison of Man with man and of manhood with Infancy you will own there is palpable ground of distinction enough.
W. W. The progress of Indls in every species from small beginnings to higher attain in his kind cannot be disputed. But still how far one species in the System of Nature of an Order Superior to others may be questioned or at least the grounds of any such superiority may be considered.
A. F. I have already hinted at what I consider as the first in the Estimate of Physical Rank. It is Power which gives reality to Existence. It is however hardly conceived to Exist untill it is exerted and even then remains to be estimated from its object. Happiness to be obtained or bestowed is the Object which fixes its Value and this value being once admired the Rank so constituted will consist in the measure of Power. Omnipotence is that to which there is no Resemblance or Approach in any Contingent Being. Even Contingent Intelligence however is of a prominent Rank in the Order of Created Being. Here is Will directed to Happiness and in proportion as this is approached There is Will to bestow it. The Will to be good to be wise Intrepid orderly is happiness And is also the Will to Bestow it. You quoted the sufferings of an iii Animal incident to man as a Proof that happi is not always proportioned to the Excellence of Mind. But the Happiness of Man is not the peculiar State of his Enjoyment at any Particular time but the Summit to which his Progress is directed & which in the Result of his Being he is finally destined. The Wants the Defects and the Sufferings of an animal are in part Constituents of the School in which this mighty Lesson of Goodness & Wisdom is to be obtained.
When the send on Earth Virtue his darling Child designed.
The present Felicity of Man consists in the possession of his Powers of Progression and the fitness of the Scene in which he is engaged by Excercise Experience and Information to conduct him in his Approaches to Happiness The measure of which at future Periods cannot now be Ascertained. But when we consider what his Intelligence may be capable of it is scarcely possible to suppose its being to determine with the organization of his animal Frame.
If Happiness be a ground sufficiently solid on which to rest in Estimating the Value of Existence. The Power to obtain and communicate Happiness as it may be modifyed in degree or Extent cannot be rejected as a distinction on which to found a Scale of Gradation in the orders to which this Distinction may apply. On this Principle mere Still matter can of itself admit of no Distinction of Value however varyed in its descript of Great or Small of Fixed or Fluid Hard or Soft &c. &c. If the Immensity of Space were filled with Diamond & Gold or with Corn & Money It would be of no more value than Vacuity or none Entity itself. This Being then if it may  called so Never could have been Created on its own Account. In Relation to living & Intelligent Being it may be a supply of some Want. It may form the scene of their operations the means of their communications the Material of their Arts and of their Beneficence. Such the Material Earth in the Variety of its parts actually is to Man &c &c. And Magnificent as the Material World is with its Countless Suns and Planets of which the nearest and the least tho of a dimension easily expressed in Numbers of any standard measure yet exceeds Imagination itself when Stated as the object of one Single or comprehensive view. The Globe of Earth itself on which Millions of Men are yearly Born does not in its Dimension does not exceed a Millioneth Part of The Sun And to these mighty orbs we are led by Analogy to Suppose that every Star in the Heavens is a Counter part and like this our Planetary System also a mere Scennery for the Reception and accommodation of Intelligent Being which without either Magnitude or Figure Constitute that Power in Existence in Subservience to which all Magnitude & Figure is created imagined for and all that we know of them after all is the sensation Perception or imagination they suggest.
On the present occasion however we  not so much concerned to fill up the Scale of Gradation in Nature as to mark what is undoubtedly to be placed in a direction to the Summit I mean Intelligence the Power of conscious Enjoyment & Felicity. We inquire what is the Actual Subject of Esteem or Admiration in the Nature of Things & by what faculty we are enabled to distinguish it. If such a Subject at all exist it must be the highest quality of the highest form of Existence or in other Words Goodness & Wisdom. The Perfection And Happiness of Intelligent Being as to the Faculty which enables us to discern I know not how Wisdom & Goodness should or can be discerned but by the Intelligence of which these are the Properties & Conscious possessions. Even he by whom they are obtained in the same measure the Sense of Defect is shunned And its opposite however mistaken is matter  continual desire. Beauty too a less Respected Name than Wisdom and Goodness still points at Perfection & Excellence and cannot long delight where these are found to be wanting. The commendation of Beauty tho meant of Excellence is given on the first Appearance of it While that excellence is reserved as matter of deliberate Judgement.
If the grounds of Esteem and admiration have been rightly assigned Mere still matter cannot bear in itself any distinction of Excellence than as it is Subservient to the Purpose of mind nor be pronounced beautiful otherwise than as it is associated with some mental affection or caries in its appearance the Design & Execution of Ingenuity & Goodness so much that it may with Confidence be said That mind alone is truly happy Excellent and Fair And if we are right in this Conclusion we are come very near to a Satisfactory Decision on the much agitated Question relating to the Principle of moral Approbation And the serious distinction of Right & Wrong. If the highest order of Being in the Gradations of Nature admits also in itself of Comparative Excellence & Defect There can be no doubt that there is in Nature a fixed Subject of Esteem which when Wanting or reversed must incur Disapprobation or contempt. The exhibition of this difference in the detail of human life will account for the distinction of Right & wrong so familiar in the Appretiation of human Actions.
This distinction and the sources of Moral Law have by Dr Clerk and the President Montesquieu have been derived from the fixed relations and Fitness of Things are of course as fixed and unalterable as things themselves and their Relations.
This if our Conclusion be true we cannot be disposed to question: but the Enunciation is too general. We must Ask what Things & Relations.
Undoubtedly The Things & Relations to which moral Laws refer That is human Mind And the Relations of Man to Man And to his Maker. By Another This Distinction is said to be founded in Truth that is in Truth relating to God & Man for there are certainly Truths to which it has no reference As in Mathematics &c &c others derive from the Utility of some Actions & the pernicious Nature of others: but in Science Morality may be Considered under two different aspects. That of the mind possessed of moral Excellence and That of The external Action which a mind so disposed is in the habit to perform. The mind may be in itself be commendable & Happy That is to say Wise & Good or in that very Condion which renders specially Estimable in an order of Being which is in itself in the highest Order of Being. Such Minds indeed having a conduct to adopt respecting fellow & fellow Creatures will Naturally choose to perform such Actions as are Usefull And as the action is preferred for being useful and it may be admitted that Virtue considered in respect to external actions is distinguished by it utility but it is Esteemed & loved not merely in proportion to its Actual Utility but in proportion to the Estimable affection or disposition which serves to Evince.
A Shower in Season may be more useful than any human Action but commands no moral Esteem Benevolence provided by misfortune of any external Effect As when a person may perish with his Child or his Friend in Attempting to save him tho without Utility is nevertheless highly Esteem and Loved.
Benevolence is in itself highly Estimable but to call it useful is a mere abuse of Words. Aristotle in the Outset of his Treatise on Ethics observes that some things are sought as Ends and others as means to some Ends.
And it happens frequently that what in one Instance is sought for as an End in another is sought as means to some Farther End and so indefinitely. The End of one pursuit is the means of another: but this cannot be infinite.
There must be some where an End Valuable in itself other no means could be of any Value. The Value of means is measured by their Utility: but the Value of the Ultimates by the Good it constitutes and ought not to be referred under the name of Utility to any Other purpose whatever. Hence The Question concerning the Chief Good is in Latin termed a Question de Finibus or of that which  valuable and to be sought on its own Account. This we cannot doubt is the proper distinction of a Mind intrepid Benevolent & Wise.
There is a Moral Sense as other tell us by which we perceive this Truth but they ought to tell us that it is true whether we perceive it or no.
Others in treating of this Subject confound two questions together as different as Wisdom is from folly and Candour from Partiality.
From what Principle may we Safely & truly decide of Action and Character.
On what Principle do men actually decide or entertain Sentiments of Praise or Blame.
To us who think the distinction of merit and demerit in Character is as real as Happiness or Misery it is idle to tell us of the false or ill founded Judgements of men with any Other View than that of warning us against them. The Sole Question at Issue is how may we Securely decide whether in General or in any Particular Case.
To the first Question we have now endeavoured to Answer That Wisdom & Goodness the Excellence of Intelligent Being is the Test of Moral Rectitude & Felicity and that well Informed Intelligence is competent to judge of Such Merits.
To the second Question we may admit that Men frequently consult their own Interest in judging of merit in Others.
To Others we may admit that what they are pleased to call sympathy or coincidence of Sentiment or reverse is the ordinary or frequent ground of Estimation of praise or Censure. But we Cannot admit that either is a safe ground of Estimation much less the only Ground which Nature had laid for the disstinction of Right & Wrong. And every attempt to Instruct us on the Subject without distinguishing the Question is not only Nugatory and Perplexing to the unwary but actually tending to explain away distinctions of the utmost importance to mankind turning Zeal for morality into a mere selfish Interest or into a mere coincidence of sentiment which may take place among Knaves and Fools as well as honest Men.
In the judgements of Men respecting others there is much Variance and sometimes difficulties arising from multiplicity of Particulars to be taken into the Account. But in the breast of the Individual Respecting himself there is seldom difficulty or Risk of That function of Wisdom or Intelligence which is termed Conscience undecided or erroneous in its Judgements. It is a Watch that Seldom Slumbers or sleeps or mistakes whatever the Party concerned may plead or pretend to others.


XXV. OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MORAL ESTIMATION. A DISCOURSE BETWEEN DAVID HUME , ROBERT CLERK AND ADAM SMITH 

When Mr Hume was at London about to publish some volume of The History of England, General Clerk called in a morning & soon after Mr Smith came in also.
Mr Clerk & Mr Hume had been talking of The History And Mr Clerk after some compliments on Mr Hume’s Stile & Politeness in writing said he was glad he had taken to History in which he could not avoid being Instructive And Agreeable too.
H I certainly shall not endeavour to avoid either of these Effects But I hope you dont think I have endeavoured to avoid them in any of my other Writings.
C. If you endeavoured you have not succeeded you are very much in fashion & I do not mean for your Doctrines. For I think you rather try to pull down other peoples Doctrines than Establish any of your own. 
H Pardon me, did I not sett out with a complete Theory of Human Nature which was so ill received that I determined to refrain from System making.
C That was rash. The world’s a System & the best we Can do is to Assist one Another in perceiving And Communicating its parts & their connections.
H I don’t know what a Man of Letters is to get by that. To be writing what every body knows or may hear from every Coffee House Acquaintance.
C That would be very idle: but I do not think Mr Hume is in danger of that even if he should discard all paradox and take to the investigation of useful truths.
H I own I am inclind to Scepticism & would avoid the Pedantry of Dogmatism But have not declared opinions on Commerce Politics & Morals. 
C I like some of your Thoughts on the Subject of Commer But for Morals and Politics you seem to play with them than to be serious.
H You surely think I am Serious in my Essays on Morality. 
C I do not doubt it. But it sounds oddly to say that morality is founded on Utility And that Virtue is only a Cow that gives milk of a Particular Sort. Alms to the Poor and every Man’s Due to himself.
C It is very true that these Actions are Useful. The good man performs them because they are Usefull and neighbours applaud them for the same reason: but is there anything more Useful than a good Cornfield. People say there is a plentiful Crop but no one says there is a Virtuous Field. 
H No, for a Good Reason: Moral Virtue is peculiar to Mind and is the utility or usefulness that proceeds from mind. That is from a Benevolent or good Intention.
C Do we not Esteem a Good Intention although from any Circumstance it be prevented of External Effect, And do we not withhold moral Approbation from mere utility that comes without Intention. In short Mind is Approved without external Effect & External Effect is not approved without Mind. And it is the mind we Approve not the Utility.
H Pardon me it is both when they come together. A Mans pretensions to Virtue are very doubtful if it have no effect in his Manners or behaviour.
C Very doubtfull indeed. The Elasticity of a Bow is very doubtful or rather incredible if an Arrow drawn to The Point is not made to fly from the String. Where benevolence is real it will be beneficent. But we are not talking of the Evidence required to evince the reality of Benevolence. We Are supposing Benevolence to be real & know how Agreeable it is apart from its external Effects.
H That I own: But to me Virtue is a course of Life directed if you will by Good Intention But realised in all the Effects of Innocence Beneficiens Sobriety and Candour.
C I understand, & because you conceive a Virtuous  & its external Effects together you Chuse to Ascribe the Approbation of it to the external Effect alone. For my part I am inclined to consider rather in respect to its Value in the Mind that possesses it, than in its Effects towards those who are within reach of its External Influence. To every man his own happiness is first & most import Concern. And Nature cannot require of a Man what is not of any Value to himself.
H Yet Virtue for the most part is admired as a Principle of Self denial.
C That proceeds from the Stupid Notion that Man is to Estimate himself as he Estimates a dead Ox from His Belly & Four Quarters so that whatever he does without a View to that Self is said to be Self denial and in this point of View but Happiness itself may be a System of Self denial. We sett out with Supposing we know What Virtue is without considering whether it be happy or Miserable. For my part I choose to refrain all terms of Praise till I know what it is to be Happy & this to every Intelligent being is the first & highest Praise. If a Person be a Wretch Praise him who will. He had better to be a Clod or a block of Wood than a Man without the requisites of a happy Mind. In this consists the excellence of Mind that he may be happy and if it fail of this Excellence is an Evil.
H Happiness is surely very different from Merit: for every Man thinks himself happy in being Gratifyed some with a dinner some with money And all with Respect & a Good Name.
C When I talk of happiness I do not go to the Rabble in the Street for an account of it. If there be in Nature affections & habits agreeable Others dissagreeable as Benevolence is Agreeable Malice the Reverse Courage Agreeable Cowardice in all its forms the Reverse I call that Man happy who is habitually Courageous & Benevolent whose Occupations & Thoughts are pleasant whose very Existence is the Tranquillity of a mind undisturbed with the Consequences of Error & Mistake or sense of meanness degradation or Wrong. If Virtue is a term of Peace And felicity. Here I fix it on Goodness & Wisdom on Fortitude Temperance And the occupations of a Strenuous Mi
It is well known that there is distinction of Good & Evil in human Life & till we have Ascertaind that distinction & made our Choice all our Inquiries & Pretensions to Philosophy are nugatory & absurd.
Here the Conversation was about to terminate when the Servant Announced Mr Adam Smith Who at the same time entered the Room with a smile on his Countenance and Muttering Somewhat to himself.
After the first Salutations Mr Hume said Smith. The General & I have been upon a Subject in which you are well versed & should have been glad of your assistance.
Sm. What was it?
H No less than the Theory of Moral Sentiment.
Sm My Book. I am sorry to have been away. I should willingly profit by your remarks. General he said then observing him for the first time I have long wished to know your opinion. I think I have removed all the difficulties & made  Theory Comple
To this The General made no Answer tho Mr Smith made some pause as expecting to hear what he would say.
And But continued People thought I should never be able to get over the difficulty of Supposing a Man to Sympathise with himself or if he did not chance to take that trouble what means he had of being admonished of his Faults. I have removed both these difficulties & should be glad to know your opinion.
C I don’t much like to trouble Authors with my opinion of their Works.
S Ah do you will Oblige me!
C If you insist upon it. I must be plain & leave no doubt.
S Surely Surely.
C Your Book is to me a Heap of absolute Nonsense.
Smith seemed to be stunnd And Clerk went on. You endeavour to explain away the disstinction of Right and Wrong by telling us that all the difference is the Sympathy or Want of Sympathy that is the Assent or Dissent of some two or more persons of whom some one Acts & some Other Observes the Action and Agrees or does not Agree in the same feeling with the Actor.
If the Observer Agree, Sympathise, go along with him or feel that he would have done the same himself.
he cannot but approve of the Action. If on the Contrary he does not Sympathise or agree with the Actor he dissents & cannot but dissapprove of him. And you seem to mean that where there is neither Assent nor dissent there is neither Right nor Wrong. And no one would ever Suppose any such thing. Or if you dont deny the reality of the Disstinction you at least furnish but a very inadequate means of discovering it. How can I be sure that a Person is in the right because I Sympathise with him. May not I myself be in the wrong. Does the presence of any Sympathy ascertain a good action: or the Want of it a bad one.
Sm. No! I have cleard up that point. Parties concerned in any transaction may be willing each to flatter himself or both Mutually to flatter one Another But to the Monitor may not fail to present himself. The well informed And impartial Observer will bring to view what the Ignorant or prejudiced would overlook.
C That is convenient to be able to bring Virtue itself to your Aid when actual Sympathy fails. You began with call Sympathy to explain Moral Sentiment. You now call up Moral Sentiment to explain itself: What is a well informed & impartial Observer: but a Virtuous Person whose Sympathy may be relied on as a Test of Virtue.
If he be well informd of what is he informd not of Astronomy or Geography for these would be of little use to him in distinguishing the Characters of men. For this purpose he must be informed of the disstinction of Right how constituted And Applyed in particular instances. And to be impartial must aim at a fair Application without Byas  any Side. Such a Person is not likely to Misslead those who confide in him and such a Person every one is concerned to become in himself instead of Acquiescing in Sympathy as the Test of Virtue appeals to Virtue as the test of Just Sympathy.
Here then ends your System. After beating round a Circle of Objections & Answers you return to the point from which you set The Phaenomena of moral disstinctions & moral sentiments to be explained.
And let us try once more how far Sympathy is adequate to this Purpose. You do not fail to tell us that Moral Sentiments are real & we trust familiar to all men you inform us that they constitute Satisfaction in some cases and distress in Others. This  of great importance & the Consequence is that we should be careful to Obtain the Satisfaction and avoid the distress.
I do not see how we can be aided in this by merely resolving these Sentiments into some other affection of the mind especially into any affection differing from themselves.
What is this Sympathy which you talk of. The word is not new: but the meaning probably is so. It is commonly Synonimous with Pity or a fellow feelin for the disstress of others. But who ever heard of Sympathizing with a Person who Pays his Debts or if this were Said it would be supposed that we pityed him for being Obliged to part with his mony: but you tell us of Sympathizing with a Hero on having gained a Battle although he escaped unhurt.
The word Sympathy in this Sense is generally unknown and to explain Moral Sentiment by Sympathy is to explain the known by the unknown The very reverse of what is required in Theory.
But if Sympathy in all the Affections or Passions were as well known as it is in Commiseration or Pity to the distressed I do not see how it could explain moral Sentiment. For where it is best known it does  produce any moral sentiment either of approbation or blame. When we pity a beggar we do not admire him for begging nor think that a person has any merit in the Toothache even if the thoughts of it should sett our Teeth on Edge or draw tears from our Eyes. If Sympathy means the participation of any Passion without disstinction I do not see how a Passion participated should be any other than Some Shade or degree of the Passion participated.
If I participate in a Persons Anger I am Angry too if in his Joy I too am Glad: but neither one nor the Other is Moral Approbation.
Sm You do not say it is but; that a man who participates in the Passion of another cannot but approve of it.
Every Passion or strong motive urging a Person to act justifies itself And if Others go along with or Sympathise; they too approve: if they do not go along with it they dissaprove or Condemn his Conduct And so he does himself if when the occasion is past he cannot go along with the passion which actuated him.
C The whole amount then is that what others term Conscience you Term Sympathie or the want of Sympathy. Every body knows, that under the operation of any strong Passion men are incapable of cool reflection.
This you call Justifying their Passion: but when it is over & they come to reflect, a Crime if committed Stares them in the face & they become a prey to remorse or Self condemnation. I do not see that your account of the Matter is any way more Intelligible than this: or that we are any way nearer the ultimate in the one Account than in the Other. Most men repose on the Fact that men are by Nature endued with a Principle of Conscience. But you say The Fact commonly called Conscience is Sympathy or the want of Sympathy. And The supposed Theory is a mere change of Words or at best an Attempt to confound two distinct principles of Nature.
This practice is too common & when substituted for Theory is insufferable. One great Object of Study certainly is to distinguish what is different as well as to bring things of a kind together. In morals Especially The judgement is badly confounded by Substituting one Thing for another.
A fashionable Philosopher has told us of late that Judgements are but Sensations. That Integrity or Elevation of mind is no more than Pride he owns indeed that it is enlightend Pride Orgueil Eclairé. Others have told us that Benevolence is mere self Love or tends alike to personal Gratification whether in his own wellfare or that of his Neighbour.
And in both these hopeful Theories. We are cautiond not to be imposed upon by the specious appearances of magnanimity or Benevolence, for the one is mere Pride The Other mere Selfishness. This to bespeak our Animosity to A Friend by Announcing him under the name of our Enemy.
At the same time The Gentleman undertakes great merit to himself for his penetration and Knowledge of Persons.
I confess I was affraid that your Sympathy might have some such Effects as this or that the differene of right & Wrong might vanish into an assent or dissent of two or more Persons who may agree in the wrong as well as the Right: but you relieve us at last by telling us you do not mean any assent or dissent at Random but that of a well informed & impartial Observer, who we would say in common language is a Virtuous Man or Competent Judge. And the preference due to such a Person is what no one doubts, tho it is the Phaenomenon which you sett out with a Purpose to explain in your Theory, And so leave it at last as others do as a Self Evident Truth which needs no Explanation.
I do not find that moralists of Old ever went into this Question. They Observed that human Life was happy or miserable & they were curious to know how one or the other was brought about. Or in Other words what was the Good on which men might rely for Happiness or Avoid as misery. This was certainly the first or most importan Question to be settled in human Life And it was certainly wise to go into it even if they should mistake the Solution. Let the Solution however be what it may if a Chief Good was acknowledged there could no longer be any doubt of the Choice to be made or if it were found that Conscience concurred with Experience in recommending the same thing, could there be any Question of the Grounds on which Conscience proceeded. I have sometimes been puzled to Guess how this Question came to be Started in modern times. Or how it came to hold such a place in Modern Philosophy.
H You may believe I do not doubt its importance as I have treated it myself yet I believe the introduction of it was in a great Measure Accidental. A performance which made some noise.
The Fable of the Bees calling Virtue the Ofspring of Flattery begot upon Pride and pretending that Private Vices were publick Benefits gave a General Allarm to the friends of Morality. And some of them sett about refuting this Sophism.
One contented that the disstinction of Virtue & Vice was founded in the Nature & fitness of Things. Another that it was founded in Truth. Another that it was founded in the natural principle of Benevolence. Another in a Specifick Sense inspird  Nature, & Which to distinguish it from mere Corporeal Sensation was called the Moral Sense.
They were all perhaps in the right And the Author of the Fable of the Bees betrayd himself when he maintaind that Private Vice was publick benefit: for as Virtue consist in publick Utility or Good how can that which is a publick Good be a Vice. Moral Sense is a mere figurative expression taken from the Analogy of our Corporeal organs in distinguishing their respective Objects but it appears trifling to me to be inquiring for reasons to Approve what is so useful as all the Virtues of Men are in Society or human Life And I hoped to Silence the Question for ever by pointing out this very real & important ground of Approbation or Preference in behalf of Virtue.
C Well done but while you considered what Virtue was in its Communications & external Effects, which are the Objects of Law and in part the recommendation of Good Manners. You forgot or overlooked what is the real recommendation of it to the Person who is to embrace it in his own mind & without whose Will it is not to exist. If it be happiness to him as Wisdom Goodness Fortitude and Temperance certainly are It is certainly a Thing good in itself not a thing recommended merely by its utility in procuring something else. We are apt to Laugh now at the Old Distinctions, Divisions And Definitions of the Schools: but it were well sometimes to mind them. Some things are Coveted as means to an End Others as Ends valuable in themselves. And if these were not somewhere such an End, the whole Fabrick of successive means would fall to the Ground: Hence the important & Genuine Question of Moral Philosophy de finibus, or what is the End And I believe that The utilitys which you point out are not ends but means concurring to the preservation of Society and this as means to furnish the Wise and with the proper Scene & Object of his Enjoyment in the Condition of his happy mind whom no false allurements can mislead nor dangers deter.

c H A P. or presages of evils which were yet to afflict _A-,-_ the republic of Rome. At this time indeed the
State of Italy seemed to have received the feeds of much trouble, and to contain ample materials of civil combustion. Ever fiince passing the Agrarian law, the Roman citizens, for whom no provision had been made at their return from military ser- vice, or who thought themselves partially dealt with in the colonies, the leaders of tumult and faction in the city, were now taught to confider land property as their joint inheritance. They were, in imagination, distributing their lots, and feleding their ihares.
In the mean time, the inhabitants of the Muni- cipia, or free towns, and their diftrids, who, not being Roman citizens, took part with the State as fubjeds, had reason to dread the rapacity of such needy and powerful sovereigns. They themselves likewise began to repine under the inequality of their own condition. They observed, that while they were scarcely allowed to retain the possessions of their fathers, Rome, aided by their arms, had gained that extensive dominion, and obtained that territory, about which the poor and the rich were now likely to quarrel among themselves. And "the Italian allies," they said, " must bleed in "this contest, no less than they have done in the "foreign or more diltant wars of the common- "wealth." They had been made, by the pro- sessions of Tiberius Gracchus, to entertain hopes that every diftindion in Italy would soon be re-
moved,
moved, that every freeman in the country would c i A ; be enrolled as a citizen of Rome, and be admitted x to all the poweis and pretensions implied in that designation. The consideration of this fubjccd therefore, could not long be delayed; and the Ro- man Senators, already struggling with the claims of their fellow-citizens, had an immediate florin to apprehend from the allies.
Transitions equivalent to revolution had been so frequent in this republic, and its progress from finall beginnings :to a great empire had been so rapid, that the changes to which men are expofedi and the exertions of which they are capable, ho where appear so conspicuous, nor are they any where so diftindly marked.
In the first ages of Rome, the difiincive impor- tance of a citizen appears not to have been fenfi- bly felt or understood. Conquered enemies were removed to Rome, and their captivity consisted in being forced to be Romans, a condition to which they submitted with great reluctance. 'In that period it is not to be doubted that every so- reigner fettling at Rome was welcome to take his place as a Roman citizen in the afilembly of the People; that many were admitted into the Se- nate ', and some even were placed on the throne . It is likely also, that the firit colonies confidered themselves as detached from the city, and as form- ing cantons apart; for we find them, like the
A 2 other x The Claudian family were aliens. 2 TaRquinius Plricus was of Greek extraeion and an alien from Tarquii':;
c H A P. other States of Italy, occasionally at war with the
_. Romans.
But when the sovereignty of Italy came to be eflablifhed at Rome, and was there actually exer- cifed by the collective body of the People, the in- habitants of the colonies, it is probable, laid claim to their votes at elections, and presented themselves to be inrolled in the Tribes. They felt their own consequence and their superiority over the Muni- cipia, or free towns in their neighbourhood, to whom, as a mark of distinction and an act of mu- nificence, some remains of independence had been left. Even in this state, the rolls of the People had been very negligently made up, or preserved. The Kings, the Consuls, the Censors, who were the officers, in different ages of the State, entruift ed with the musters, gave the privilege of citizens to such as presented themselves, or to such as they were pleated to receive on the rolls. One Consul invited all the free inhabitants of Latium to poll in the assemblies of the People; another rejected them, and in time of elections sorbad them the city. But notwithitanding this pro- hibition, aliens who had been brought to Rome even as captives, were suffered by degrees to mix with the citizens'. The inhabitants of the free towns, removing to Rome upon any creditable footing, found easy admission among the mem- bers of some tribe; but from the facility of this admission, the towns complained they were de- populated; and the Senate at last, sensible of the
abuse, x This happened particularly in the cafe of the Campanians;
abuse, endeavoured to shut the gates of their city c H A P. by repeated fcrutinies, and the prohibition of fur- reptitious enrolments: but in vain. The prac- tice still continued, and the growing privilege, dif- tindion, and eminence of a Roman citizen, made that title become the great object of ambition to individuals, and to entire cantons. It had already been extended to diftrids whose inhabitants were not distinguished by any singular merit towards the Roman State. In this refped all the allies were nearly equal; they had regularly composed at least one half in every Roman army, and had borne an equal ihare in all the dangers and trou- bles of the commonwealth; and, from having va- lued themselves of old on their separate titles and national diftindions, they began now to aspire to a ihare in the sovereignty of the empire, and wiih- ed to fink for ever their municipal designations under the general title of Romans.
Not only the great power that was enjoyed in the assembly of the People, and the serious privi- leges that were beflowed by the Porcian law, but even the title of citizen in Italy, of legionary fol- dier in the field, and the permission of wearing the Roman toga or gown, were now ardently coveted as marks of dignity and honour. The city was frequented by persons who hoped separately to be admitted in the Tribes, and by numbers who crowded from the neighbouring cantons, on every remarkable day of assembly, still flattering them- selves, that the expectations which Gracchus had

or public afferhbly, this concourse of aliens, and requiring all the country towns in-Italy to recall their denizens, who had left their own corpora- tions to acd the part of citizens at Rome.
On this occasion, Caius Gracchus, the brother of the late unfortunate Tribune, flood forth, and made one of the firif exhibitions, in which he displayed the extent of his talents, as well as made known the party he was likely to espouse in the commonwealth. Being about twenty years of age when the troubles occasioned by his elder brother had so much disturbed the republic, and ended so fatally for himself, this young man retired upon that cataRtrophd from the public view, and made it uncertain whether the sufferings of his family might not deter him, not only from embracing like dangerous counsels, but even from entering at all on the scene of political affairs. His retire- ment, however, he had employed in such fludies as were then come into repute, on account of their importance, as a preparation for the business of the courts of justice, of the Senate, or the po- pular assemblies; and the firit public appearance he made gave evident proof of the talents he had acquired for there several departments. His parts seemed to be quicker, and his spirit more ardent,
than
than those of his brother Tiberius; and the peo- c H A P.
x. pie conceived hopes of having their pretensions X revived, and more successfully conducted, than they had been under any former leader. The cause of the country towns, in which he now en- gaged, was specious, but as the part he took in it was likely to form a new and a numerous party, prepared for every fadious attempt, and as he professed to make way for the promiscuous ad- mission of strangers on the rolls of the People; a measure which tended so much to distract the republic, to diminish the consequence of those who were already citizens, the argument in fa- vour of the resolution to purge the city of aliens prevailed, and an ad to that purpose now mov- ed in the assembly of the People, accordingly passed .
It deserves to be recorded, that amidst the in- quiries set on foot in consequence of this edict, or about this time, Perperna, the father of a late Consul 2, was claimed by one of the Italian corpo- rations, and found not to have been a citizen of Rome. His son, whom we have already mention- ed, having vanquished and taken Ariftonicus, the pretended heir of Attalus, died in his command at Pergamus; he is accordingly said to have been a rare example of the caprice of fortune, in

The fires of sedition which had sometime prey- ed on the commonwealth, were likely to break out with increasing force upon the promotion of Fulvius Flaccus to the dignity of first magistrate. U. C. 62. This factious citizen had blown up the flame with M. Planitus Hipfus, M.Tiberius Gracchus, and having succeeded him in Fulvius rlaccus. the commission for executing the Agrarian law,
never failed to carry the torch wherever matter of inflammation or general combustion could be found. By his merit with the popular party he had attained his present eminence, and was de- termined to prcferve it by continuing his services. Legcs Ful- He accordingly began the functions of his office by
proposing a law to communicate the freedom of the city to the allies or free inhabitants of Italy; a measure which tended to weaken the power of the Senate, and to increase the numbers of the Peo- ple greatly beyond what could be convened in any one collective body. Having failed in this attempt, he substituted a proposal in appearance more mo- derate, but equally dangerous, That whoever claim- ed the right of citizen, in cafe of being cafi by the Censors, who were the proper judges, might ap- peal to the popular assembly I. This might have conferred the power of naturalization on the lead- ers of faction; and the danger of such a measure,

The Consul thus already entered on his popular career, uniting the power of supreme magifirate with that of a commissioner for the execution of the Agrarian law, and likely to break through all the forms which had hitherto retarded or flood in the way of this measure, was with difficulty per- fuaded to call a meeting of the Senate, and to take his place ill that body. The whole, as soon as they were met, joined in representations against there dangerous measures, and in a request that he would withdraw his motions. To there expoitulations he made no reply I; but an occasion soon after- wards offered, by which the Senate was enabled to divert him from these facious pursuits in the city. A deputation arrived from Marseilles, then in alliance with Rome, to request the support of the republic against the Salyii, a neighbouring nation, who had invaded their territories. The Senate gladly embracing this opportunity to find employ- ment abroad for the Confij, decreed a speedy aid to the city of Marseilles, and appointed M. Ful- vius Flaccus to that service. Although this inci- dent marred or interrupted for the present the po- litical designs of the Consul, yet he was induced, by the hopes of a triumph, to accept of the com- mand which offered, and, by his absence, to re- lieve the city for a while from the alarms which he had given.

In this interval some laws are said to have pas- fed refpeding the office and conduct of the Cen- fors. The particulars are not mentioned; but the object probably was, to render the magistrate more circumfpet in the admission of those who claimed to be numbered as citizens. Such at least was like- ly to be the policy of the State in the absence of demagogues, who, by proposing to admit the allies on the rolls of the People, had awakened dange- rous pretensions in every corner of Italy. It soon appeared how seriously these pretensions were adopted by the country towns; for the inhabi- tants already beftirred themselves, and were begin- ning to devise how they might extort by force what they were not likely to obtain with content of the original citizens of Rome. A suspicion ha- ving arisen of such treasonable concerts forming at Fregellke ', the Praetor Opimius had a special com- mission to inquire into the matter, and to proceed as he flould find the occasion required. Having fum- mcncd the chief magistrate of the place to appear before him, he received from this officer, upon a pro- mise of security to his own person, full information of the combinations that had been forming against the government of Rome. So infirucded, the Praztor assembled such a force as was necessary to support

This tranfadion was scarcely past, when Caius Gracchus appeared in the city to solicit the office of Tribune; and, by his pretence, revived the hopes of the allies. Having observed, that the Proconsul Aurelius Cotta, under whom he was acting as Proqueftor in Sardinia, instead of being recalled, was continued in his command, and furnished with reinforcements and supplies of every fort as for a service of long duration; and fufpeding, that this measure was pointed against himself, and proceeded from a design to keep him at a distance from the popular assemblies, he quitted his fiation in Sardinia, and returned to Rome without leave. Being called to account by the Censors for de- serting his duty; he defended himself with such ability and force, as greatly raised the expectations which had already been entertained by his party2.
The law, he said, required him only to carry arms ten years, he had adually carried them twelve years; although he might legally have quitted his

X. yet he had remained in it three years. However
willing the Censors might have been to remove this turbulent spirit from the commonwealth, they were too weak to attempt any censure in this slate of his cause, and in the present humour of the People. They endeavoured, in vain, to load him with a share in the plot of Fregella; he till exculpated himself: and, if he had pofiefled every virtue of a citizen, in proportion to his resolution, applica- tion, eloquence, and even severity of manners, he might have been a powerful support to the State. In a speech to the People, on his return from Sar- dinia, he concluded with the following remarkable words: " The purse which I carried full to the "province, I have brought empty back. Others "having cleared the wine casks which they carried
from Italy, bring them back from the provinces " replenished with silver and gold '."
In declaring himself a candidate for the office of Tribune, Caius Gracchus professed his intention to propose many popular ats. The Senators exert- ed all their influence to disappoint his views; but such were the expectations now entertained in Italy, that multitudes crowded to the elecion in greater numbers than could find place in the public square. His partizens handed and reached out their ballots at the windows and over the battlements; but Gracchus, though eleted, was, in consequence

Cornelia, the lifter of one Scipio Africanus, and the mother-in-law of the other, but still better known as the mother of the Gracchi, who, ever since the death of her son Tiberius, lived in re- tirement in Campania, upon hearing of the career which her son, Caius, was likely to run, alarmed at the renewal of a scene which had already occa- iioned her so much sorrow, expoftulated with him on the course he was taking; and, in an unaffect- ed and paflionate address, spoke that ardent zeal for the republic, by which the more refpedable citizens of Rome had been long distinguished.
This high-minded woman, on whom the entire care of her family had devolved by the death of her husband, whilst the children were yet in their infancy, or under age, took care, with unusual at- tention, to have them educated for the rank they were to hold in the State, and did not fail even to excite their ambition. When Tiberius, after the disgrace of Mancinus, appeared to withdraw from the road of preferments and honours, " How " long," she said, " fiall I be distinguished as the "mother-in-law of Scipio, not as the mother of
the Gracchi ?" This latter diflindion, however, ihe came to possess; and it has remained with her name, but from circumstances and events which this refpetable personage by no means appeared to desire. In one fragment of her letters to Caius,
which x Plttarch, Appian, Orofiz, Entrop. Obfcluens-
C I A P. which is fill preserved, " You will tell me," lhe
._' said, " that it is glorious to be rcvenged of our
" enemies. No one thinks so more than I do, if " we can be revenged without hurt to the repub- " lie; but if not, often may our enemies escape. " Long may they be safe, if the good of the com- " monwealth requires their safety." In another letter, which appears to be written after his inten- tion of suing for the Tribunate was declared, fle accosts him to the following purpose: " I take " the gods to witness, that, except the persons " who killed my son Tiberius, no one ever gave " me so much affliction as you now do in this mat- " ter. You, from whom I might have expected "' some consolation in my age, and who, surely, of " all my children, ought to be most careful not to " distress me ! I have not many years to live.

gods forbid you flould persist ! if you do, I " fear the course you are taking leads to remorse L' and distraction, which will end only with your " life'."
These remonflrances do not appear to have had any effect. Caius, upon his accession to the Tri-
bunate, x Fragmenta Corn. Nepotis ab Andrea Scotto colle'a, edita cum fcripti' Corn. Nepotis.
bunate, proceeded to fulfil the expedations of his c i . p. party. The Agrarian law, though still in force,. x. had met with continued interruption and delay in the execution. It was even falling into neglet. Caius thought proper, as the first ad of his magi Lex Sem-
pronia agra- firacy, to move a renewal and confirmation of it, ria. with express injunctions, that there should be an annual distribution of land to the poorer citizens x. To this he subjoined, in the firit year of his office, a variety of regulations tending either to increase his own popularity, or to distinguish his admini- Lexfrumen-
taria. firation. Upon his motion, public granaries were erected, and a law was made, that the corn should be issued from thence monthly to the People, two parts in twelve under the prime or original cost 2.
This ad gave a check to industry, which is the befl guardian of manners in populous cities, or wherever multitudes of men are crowded together.
Caius likewise obtained a decree, by which the estates of Attalus, king of Pergamus, lately be- queathed to the Romans, should be let in the man- ner of other lands under the infpedion of the Cen- fors; but the rents, instead of being made part of. the public revenue, should be allotted for the main- tenance of the poorer citizens 3.

x' .cd for ever disqualificd to serve the republic in any
other station. This aft was intended to operate against Odavius, who, by the influence of Tibe- rius, had been degraded from the office of Tri- bune; and the ad took its title fiom the name of the person against whom it was framed '.
To these were joined, an at to regulate the conditions of the military service2, by which no one was obliged to enter before seventeen years of age, and by which Roman soldiers waere to receive cloathing as well as pay 3; poflibly the firit intro- dudtion of a uniform into the Roman legions: a circumstance which, in modern times, is thought so essential to the character of troops, or the appear- ance of an army.
By the celebrated law of Porcius, which allow- ed of an appeal to the People, every citizen had a remedy against any oppressive sentence or proceed- ing of the executive magistrate; but this did not appear to Gracchus a sufficient restraint on the offi- cers of State. He proposed to have it enacted, that no person, under pain of a capital punish- ment, ihould at all proceed against a citizen with- out a special commission or warrant from the Peo- ple to that effect. And he proposed to give this law a retrofped, in order to comprehend Popilius Laenas 4, who, being Consul in the year after the
troubles x Privilegium in Oclavium. 2 De militum commodis. 3 Plutarch. in C. Graccho.---Lex Sempronia dc libertate civium. 4. Cicer. in Cluentio; pro Rabino; pro domo fua,
troubles occasioned by Tiberius Gracchus, had, CHAP. under the authority of the Senate alone, proceed- ed to try and condemn such as were accefory to that sedition. Laenas perceived the storm that was gathering against him, and chose to avoid it by a voluntary exile. This at was indeed almost an entire abolition of government, and a bar to the most ordinary measures, required for the peace of the commonwealth. A popular fation could withhold every power, which, in their appre- henfion, might be employed against themselves; and in their most pernicious designs had no in- terruption to fear from the Ditator named by the Senate and Consuls, nor from the Consul armed with the authority of the Senate for the fuppref- lion of disorders; a resource to which the repu- blic had frequently owed its preservation. But as we find no change in the administration of justice upon this new regulation, it is probable that the absurdity of the law prevented its effect.
While Gracchus thus proposed to make all the powers of the State depend for their existence on the occasional will of the People, he meant also to render the assemblies of the People themselves more democratical, by Dtripping the higher classes of any prerogative, or influence they might derive from mere precedence, in leading the public decisions. The Centuries being hitherto called to vote in the order of their classes, those of the first or highest class, by voting first, set an example which influ-

Under this active Tribune, much public bufi- ness, that used to pass through the Senate, was en- grossed by the popular aifembliest Even in the form of these assemblies, all appearance of refpe&t to the Senate was laid aside. The Rofira, or plat- form on which the presiding magifirate stood, was placed in the middle of an area, of which one part was the market-place, surrounded with stalls and booths for merchandize, and the courts ofjuftice; the other part, called the Comitium, was open to receive the People in their public assemblies; and on one fide of it, fronting the Rofira, or bench of the magistrates, flood the Curia, or Senate-houfe. The People, when any one was speaking, stood partly in the market-place, and partly in the Comitium. The speakers directed their voice to the Comi- tium, so as to be heard in the Senate. This dif- position, Gracchus reverted; and directing his voice to the Forum, or market-place, seemed to dif- place the Senate, and to deprive that body of their office as watchmen and guardians of the public or- der in matters that came before the popular assem- blies 2.

At the time that the Tribune Caius Gracchus cHAP. engaged the minds of his contemporaries, and fur- -. . nifhed hifory chiefly with these effects of his sac- tious and turbulent spirit, it is obfeived, that he himself executed works of general utility; bridges highways, and other public accommodations throughout Italy. That the State having car- ried its arms, for the first time, beyond the mari- time extremity'of the Alps, happily terminated the war with the Salyii, a nation of Gaul, whose territory in the sequel became the first province of Rome in.that country. And that, ill confquence of what passed .in this quarter, Caius Sextius, Consul of the preceding year, was. authorised to place a colony in the neighbourhood of.the hot springs, which, from .his name, were, called the Aque .Sextiae, and are. fill known by a. corruption of the fame appellation .
From Asia, at the fame time, it was reported, that Ariarathes, the king of Cappadocia, and ally ,of the Romans, was murdered, at the instigation of Mithridates, king of Pontus, whose ifter he had married; that the murdered Prince had left a son for whom Mithridates asseted to fecure.the king- dom ; but that the widowed queen having fallen into the hands of Nicomedes, king of Bythinia, this prince, in her right hlad taken possession of -Cappadocia, while Mithridates, in name of his ne- phew, was hastening to remove him from thence. On'this subjet a resolution was adopted in the aflembly of the People at Rome, that both Nico-

C H A P. medes and Mithridates should be required imme-
diately to evacuate Cappadocia, and to withdraw their troops. This resolution Caius Gracchus op- posed with all his eloquence and his credit, char- ging his antagonists aloud with corruption, and a clandestine correspondence with the agents, who, on different fides, were now employed at Rome in soliciting this affair. " None of us," he said, " fland " forth in this place for nothing. Even I, who de-
fire you to put money in your own coffers, and to " consult the interest of the State, mean to be paid,
not with silver or gold indeed, but with your a favour and a good name. They who oppose this " resolution likewise covet, not honours from you, " but money from Nicomedes; and they who sup- *' port it, expea to be paid by Mithridates, not by ' you. As for those who are silent, they, I be- " lieve, understand the market best of all. They "have heard the story of the poet, who being vain "that he had got a great fum of money for re- "hearsing a tragedy, was told by another, that "it was not wonderful he had got so much for "talking, when I, said the other, who it seems " knew more than he was wished to declare, have " got ten times as much for holding my tongue. " There is nothing that a king will buy at so " great a price, on occasion, as silence 1."
Such, at times, was the style in which this po- pular orator was pleased to address his audience. Individuals are won by flattery, the multitude by

buffoonry and satire. From the tendency of this c H A P. speech, it appears to have been the opinion of X- Gracchus, not that the Romans Ihould sequester the kingdom of Cappadocia for the heirs of Ariarathes, but that they should seize it for themselves. The question, however, which now arose relating to the fucceffiom to this kingdom, laid the foundation of a tedious and bloody war, of which the operations and events will occur in their place.

In this he fol- lowed the example of his brother Tiberius in a itep, which, being reckoned illegal as well as alarming, was that which hastened his ruin. An attempt had been since made by Papirius Carbo to have the legality of such re-elections acknowledg- ed; but this having failed, Caius Gracchus, with great address, inserted in one of his popular edics, a clause declaring it competent for the People to re-elect a Tribune, in cafe he should need a con- tinuation of his power in order to fulfil his publkc engagements. To avail himself of this clause, he now declared, that his views in behalf of the

This revolution in the courts ofjuftice accordingly may have contributed greatly to haften the approaching corruption of manners, and the disorders of the Itate.

ficers to govern the provinces; and, if it'had been C u A P. firidly observed, might have made some compen- ' fation for the former. The power of naming such officers.was committed to the Senate; and the ar- rangements were to be annually made before the election of Consuls. This continued to be law, but was, often over-ruled by the People .
In the fame year, the boldest and most dange- rous projec ever formed by any popular leader, that of extending the roll of Citizens to all the Italian allies, already attempted by Fulvius Flac- cus, was again renewved by Caius Gracchus; and by the utmost exertion of. the vigilance and au- thority of the Senate, with great difficulty pre- vented.
The rumour of this projea having brought mul- titudes to Rome, the Senate thought it necessary to give the Consuls in charge, that on the day this important question was to come on, they flould clear the city of all firangers, .and not susser any aliens to remain within four miles of the walls. While this business remained in fufpence, Gracchus flattered the poorer citizens with the profped of advantageous settlements, in certain new colonies, of fix thousand men each, which he proposed to plant in the diftrits of Campania and Tarentum, the best cultivated and most opulent parts of Italy, and in colonies, which he likewise proposed to fend abroad into some of the richest provinces.

H AP. Such settlements had been formerly made to oc-
- --cupy and secure some recent conquest abroad;
they were now calculated to serve as allurements to popular favour, and as a provision, made by the leaders of fadion, for their own friends and adherents at Rome.
The Senate, attacked by such popular arts, re- solved to retort on their adversaries; and for this purpose encouraged Marcus Livius, another of the Tribunes, and probably jealous of Gracchus, to take such measures as Ihould, if possible, supplant him in the favour of the People. Livius, according- ly, professing to act in concert with the Senate, pro- posed a number of ads: one to conciliate the minds of the allies, by giving them, while they served in the army, the fame exemption from corporal pu- ex Lvia nifhment, which the Roman citizens had enjoyed. Civium La- Another for the establishment of twelve diffe- tini Nomi- is. rent colonies, each of three thousand citizens. But
what, possibly, had the greatest effea, because it appeared to exceed in munificence all the edits of Gracchus, was an exemption of all those lands, which mhould be distributed in terms of the late Sempronian Law, from all quit-rents and public burdens, which had hitherto, in general, been laid on all porffefions that were held from the public '. It was proposed to name ten commissioners to dif- tribute lands thus unincumbered to the People; and three colonies are mentioned, Syllaceum, Ta- rentum, and Neptunia or Peltum, as having been

actually sent abroad in this year, and probably on c H A P. these terms. -
About the fame time it was decreed, that the exRubria. city of Carthage ihould be rebuilt for the recep- tion of a colony of fix thousand Roman citizens. This decree bears the name, not of Sempronius or of Livius, but of Rubrius, another Tribune of the fame year.
The Senate readily agreed to the settlement of these colonies, as likely to divide the popular fa- vour, to carry off a number of the more facious citizens, and to furnish an opportunity likewise of removing from the city, for some time, the po- pular leaders themselves, under pretence of em- ploying them to conduct and to fettle the families destined to form those establishments. According- ly, Caius Gracchus, and Fulvius Flaccus, late Con- ful, and now deeply engaged in all these fadious measures, were destined to take charge of the new colonists, and to superintend their settlement '.

H A p. Caius Gracchus, having the presumption to of-
f er himself a third time candidate for the office of Tribune, was rejeced, and had the mortification to find, that the authority of the Senate began to prevail; and, as they had credit enough to. pro- cure his exclusion from any fliare in the magiitra- cy, so they might 'be able to fruttrate or reverse many of the ads he had obtained in the pursuit or execution of his projects
By the repulse of.Gracchus and his afrociates, the ariftocratical party came to have a majority, even in the college-of Tribunes, Questions oflegif- lation were now likely to be determined in the as- fembly of -the Centuries; and this circumstance alone, while the Senate was able. to retain it, was equivalent to an entire restitution of the arifto- cratical government. The Centuries, under the leading of an active Consul,. were likely to annul former resolutions with the fame decilion and ra- pidity with which they had been passed. Much violence was - expected, and the different parties, recolleting what had happened in the cafe of Ti- berius Gracchus, and careful not to be surprised by their antagonists; for the most part came to 'the place of assembly in bands, even under arms, and endeavoured to poiefs the advantage of the ground as in the presence of an enemy.

This motion, was firenuoufly opposed ,by Fulvius IFlaccus, and by Caius Grac- chus, who treatqd.the reportof presages from As- rica as a, mere fi.iqn, and the whole design as pro- ceeding, -froi'm the inveterate :hatred ,of the Nobles to the Peopie. , Before the affemblymet, in which this question. was to be decided,. the popular lead- ers.. attemp.ted to., ffeiztei .the Capitol, bu.t, found themnfelves prevented by: the Gonful, who had .al- ready, with an armed force, secured that station.:
In the morning after they had.received this dif- appointment, the. People being assembled, and the Consul being employed in offering up the cufto. mary sacrifices, Graschus, with his party, came to their place, in the ;Comitium. One of the.atten- dants of. the .Consul, who was removing the en- trails of a; viCtim, reproached Gracchus, as .he pafled, with sedition, and in the petulance of a retainer to power, bid him desist from his machi- nations against the government of the common- wealth. On this provocation, one of the party of Gracchus struck the offende.r .with.,-his dagger,; and killed himl on the spot. The cry of murder ran through the multitude, and the assembly began to break up. Gracchus endeavoured to speak, but could not.be heard for the tumult; and all thoughts of business were laid aside. The Consul imme- diately summoned the Senate to meet; and hav- ing reported a murder committed in the place of
affemnbly,
CHAP. assembly, and what appeared to him the firif
v--: adt of hostility in a war, which the popular sac-
tion had prepared against the State, he received the charge that was usual on perilous occasions, to provide, in the manner which his own pru- dence ihould direc, for the safety of the com- monwealth. Thus authorised, he commanded the Senators and the Knights to arm, and made pro- per dispositions to secure the principal streets. Being master of the Capitol and Forum, he ad- journed the assembly of the People to the usual' place on the following day, and cited the persons accused of the murder that was recently commit- ted, to answer for the crime which was laid to their charge.
In consequence of this adjournment, and the Gonful's instructions, numbers in arms repaired to the Comitium at the hour of aflembly, and were ready to execute such orders as they might receive for the public safety. Gracchus and Fulvius re- fused to obey the citation they had received, and the Capitol being secured against them, they took post, with a numerous party in arms, on the Aventine Hill, which was opposite to the Capitol, and from which, though more distant, they equal- ly looked down on the Circus, the Forum and the place of assembly.
Being again cited to appear at the Tribunal of the Roman People, they sent a young man, one of the sons of Fulvius, to capitulate with the Consul, and to fettle the terms on which they should de- scend from their strong-hold. To this meflage
they
they were told, in return, that they must answer c H A P.
x. at the bar of the aflembly, as criminals, not pre- tend to negociate with the republic, as equals; that no party, however numerous, was entitled to parley with the People of Rome: and to this an- fwer the meflenger was forbidden, at his peril, to bring any reply. The party, however, frill hoped to gain time, or to divide their enemies; and they ventured to employ young Fulvius again to repeat their message. He was seized by the Consul's or- der. Gracchus and Fulvius, with their adherents, were declared public enemies; and a reward was offered to the person who should kill or secure them. They were infiantly attacked, and, after a little refitance, forced from their ground. Grac- chus fled by the wooden bridge to the opposite ide of the Tiber, and was there slain, .either by his own hand, or by that of a faithful servant, who had undertaken the talk of thus saving him in his last extremity from falling into the power of his ene- mies. Fulvius was dragged to execution from a bath where he attempted to conceal himself. The heads of both were carried to the Consul, and ex. changed for the promised reward.
In this fray the party of the Senate, being re- gularly armed and prepared for slaughter, cut off the adherents of Caius Gracchus and Fulvius in greater numbers than they had done those of Ti- berius; they killed about three thousand two hundred and fifty in the streets, and confined great numbers, who were afterwards firangled in the prisons. The bodies of the slain, as the law
ordained,
c H A P. ordained, in the cafes of treason, being denied the
X. forms of a funeral, were cast into the giver, and
their estates confiscated .
The house of Fulvius was rafed, and the ground on which it flood was-laid open for public uses; from these beginnings, it appeared that the Ro- mans, who, in the pursuit of their, foreign con- quests, had so liberally shed the blood of other nations, might become equally lavish of their own-

T HE popular party had,. in the late tumults, cH A P.
carried their violence to such extremes, as _vI disgusted and alarmed every person who had any desire of domestic peace; and in their ill-advifed recourse to arms, but too well juflified the mea- fures which had been taken againit them. By this exertion of vigour, the Senate, and ordinary ma-, giftrates, recovered their former authority; affairs returned to their usual channel, and the most per- feet order seemed to arise from the late confusions.
ueftions of legislation were allowed to take their rife in the Senate, and were not carried to the Peo- ple, without the fandion of the Senate's authority. The legislative power was excrcifcd in the assem- bly of the Centuries, and the prohibitory or de- fenfive function of the Tribunes, or representatives of the People, without ltopping the proceedings of
government,
c HA P. government, or substituting a democratical ufur-
xi. pation, was such as to check the abuses of execu-
tive power in the hands of the aristocracy. Even the judicative power, veiled in the Equestrian or- der, promised to have a salutary effect, by holding a balance between the different ranks and distinct- ions of men in the republic.
Meanwhile the ariflocratical party, notwith- standing the ascendant they had recently gained, did not attempt to rescind any of the regular in- ftitutions of Gracchus; they were contented with inflicting punishments on those who had been ac- ceffory to the late sedition, and with re-eftabliih- ing such of the nobles as had suffered by the vio. lence of the popular faction. Popilius Laenas, driven into exile by one of the edits of Gracchus, or by the persecution to which it exposed him, was now recalled upon the motion of Calpurnius Pifo one of the Tribunes . u. c. 633. As the state of parties was in some measure re-
UbuiS, versed, Papirius Carbo, who wished to be of the ard C. Pa. winning fide, thought proper to withdraw from bo. that he had espoused; and, by the credit of those
now in possession of the government, was promoted to the station of Consul, and yielded the first fruits of his conversion by defending the cause of his predecessor Opimius, who, at the expiration of his Consulate, was brought to trial for having put Roman citizens to death without the forms of law. Carbo, though himself conneted with those who
suffered x Cicero in Bruto.
suffered in that inflance, now pleaded the juflice c H . p.
xi. and necessity of the late military executions ; and, a upon this plea, obtained the acquittal of his client.
This merit on the part of Carbo, however, did not so far cancel his former offences as to prevent his being himself tried and condemned in the fol- lowing year, as an accomplice in the sedition of Gracchus. He was supposed to have been accessary to the murder of Scipio; and his cause not being warmly espoused by any party, he fell a sacrifice to the imputation of this heinous crime. It is said, that upon hearing his sentence pronounced, he killed himself1.
Odavius, one of the Tribunes of the present Lex o-a-
via SI1- year, moved an amendment of the law obtained mentaria. by Gracchus, refpeding the distribution of corn from the public granaries, probably to ease the treasury in part of that burden; but the particu- lars are unknown.
About this time appeared in the assemblies of the People the celebrated Caius Marius. Born of ob- fcure parents in the town of Arpinum, on the Liris 2, and formed amidst the occupations of a peasant 3, and the hardlhips of a legionary soldier, of rustic manners, but ofa resolute spirit, and eager ambition. Without any other apparent title than that of being a denifon of Rome, he now laid claim to the honours

c H A P. bs the state. He is remarkable for having suffered ,. _ * more repulses in his first attempts to be eleted in-
to office, and for having succeeded more frequent- ly afterwards, than any other Roman citizen during the existence of the commonwealth.
Marius, after being disappointed in his first can- vas for the office of Tribune. succeeded in the fol- lowing year. The ads which were pafled under his Tribunate, and which bear his name, do not Lex Maria carry any violent expressions of party spirit, nor gis. give intimation of that insatiate ambition with
which he afterwards distressed his country; the first related to the conduct of elections, and pro- vided some remedy for an evil which was com- plained of in the manner of soliciting votes. The space between the rails, by which the citizens pafled to give in their ballots, was so broad as to admit, not only those who came to vote, but the candidates also, with their adherents and friends, who came to importune and to overawe the People in the very a& of giving their suffrage. Marius proposed to put an end to this practice, and to provide for the entire uninfluenced freedom of election, by narrowing the entrance, so that on- ly the voters could pass. A party of the Nobles, with Aurelius Cotta the Consul at their head, not knowing with what a resolute spirit they were a .out to contend, being averse to this reformation, prevailed on the Senate to withhold its aflent, without lihich any regu!lnr quefion on this sub- .et couldl not be put to the People. But Marius,
in the character of Tribune, threatened the Con- c H A P. ful with immediate imprisonment, if he did not v'_ move the Senate to recall its vote. The matter being reconsidered, Lucius Metellus, who was first on the Rolls, having given his voice for affirming the flrft decree, was ordered byl Marius into cufio- dy; and there being no Tribune to intercede fbr him, must have gone to prison, if the dispute had not terminated by the majority agreeing to have the matter carried to the People, as Marius propo- fed, with the fandcion of the Senate's authority.
In another of the ads of Marius the republic was frill more indebted to his wisdom and cou- .rage, in withflanding an attempt of one of his .colleagues to flatter the indigent citizens at the ex- pence of the public treasury, by lowering the terms on which corn, in pursuance of an order rc- -cently obtained by Ocdavius, was distributed from the granaries. This was an ordinary expedient of 'Tribunitian faction. Marius opposed it as of dan- gerous consequence. And his conduct in this mat- ter marked him out as one not to be awed by cla- mour, and a person, who, into whatever party he ihould be admitted, was destined to govern. The times indeed were likely to give more importance to his character as a soldier than as a citizen; and in that he was fill farther raised above the cen- sure of those who were inclined to revile or un- dervalue what were called his upstart preten- Sions '.

c H A P. Fromi the time that the Romans first paired into
x .. the Transalpine Gaul, as auxiliaries to the repub-
lic of Marseilles, they had maintained in that neigh- bourhood a certain military establishment; and, by planting colonies at convenient stations, ihewed their intention of retaining possessions on that fide of the Alps. Betultus, or Betultich, a prince of the country, who was supposed to have a force at command of two hundred thousand men, attempt- ed to expel these intruders, but was defeated, first by the Proconsul Fabius, afterwards by Domitius Ahenobarbus, who found in their conflicts with this enemy the occasion of their refpetive tri- umphs. This prince himself became a captive to Domitius, and was carried to Rome, where he was led in procession, diflinguiflied by his paint- ed arms and his chariot of silver, the equipage in which it was said he usually led his army to battle I. . c. 633. It appears that the Romans had availed them-
selves of their pofieffions in Africa, to be supplied with elephants from thence, and these they em- ployed in the first wars they made in Gaul; for the vitory of Domitius is attributed to the effec that was produced by these animals .
Quintus Marcius succeeded Domitius in the command of the troops which were employed in Gaul, and continued to gain ground on the na-
tives, I Vc!ccius Pater. Animianus Marcel!. l . fine. Pxf dian.us in Verri r.im Secun;.a: Val. Max. lib. v. c. p,
tives, who took arms from different cantons fuc- c H A P. ceffively againit him. He planted a colony at Xl. Narbo, to strengthen the frontier of the newly- acquired province on one fide; and, as the Ro- mans had hitherto always passed by sea into that country, he endeavoured to open a palfage by the Alps, in order to have a communication by land with Italy on the other. In the course of there operations the Steni, an Alpine nation that ob- flruaed his march, was entirely cut off.
About this time the Roman generals obtained their triumphs on different quarters, in the Bali- ares and in Dalmatia, as well as in Gaul; and the republic did not meet for some years with an ene- my able to resist her power, except on the fide of Thrace and the Ifter or Danube, where a Pro- consul of the name of Cato was defeated; and where a refitance was for some years kept up by the natives.
But of the foreign affairs which now occupied the attention of the Romans, the molt memorable was that which arose from the contest of pretenders to the crown of Numidia, which, by the death of Micipfa, the son and successor of Massinissa, came to be disposed of about this time. The late king had two sons, Adherbal and Hiempfal. He had likewise adopted Jugurtha, the natural son of his brother Manaflabal, whom he had employed at the head of his armies, thinking it safer to gain him by good offices, than to provoke him by a total exclusion from favour. This monarch had formed a pro-
C3 jed,
c II .A P. jCe, fr. quent in barbarous times, but always ru-
, minous, to divide his territories; and he hoped
that, while he provided for his own sons, he ifhould lecure to them, from motives of grati- tude, the protection and good offices of Jugurtha, whom he admitted to an equal share with them in the partition of his kingdom. The confequen- ces of this mistaken arrangement soon appeared in the diftracions that followed, and which arose from the ambition of Jugurtha, who, not content with his part of the kingdom, aspired to make himself master of the whole. For this purpose he formed a secret design against the lives of both the brothers, of whom the younger, Hiempfal, fell into a snare, which was laid for him, and was killed. Ad- herbal, being more cautious, obliged his crafty ene- my to declare himself openly, took the field againit him with all the forces he could raise, but was de- feated, and obliged to take refuge in the Roman province, and from thence thought proper to pass into Italy, in order to lay his complaints before the Senate and People of Rome.
Maflinifa, the grandfather of this injured prince, had given etfectual aid to the Romans in their wars with Carthage; and, upon the final reduc- tion of that republic, was rewarded with a con- iiderable part of its spoils. From this time for- ward the Romans expeced, and the kings of Nu- midia actually paid to them, a deference in the manner of a vassal or tributary prince to his so- vereign lord. Upon the faith of this connection
with-
with Rome, Adherbal now carried his complaints c HAP . to that city; and Jugurtha, knowing how ready . the Romans were, in the characer of arbitrators, to confider themselves as the sovereign among nations, thought proper to fend a deputation oi his own part, to counteract the representations of his rival.
This crafty Numidian had served under Scipio at the siege of Numantia, where he had an oppor- tunity of observing the manners and discipline of the Romans, and accommodated hinrfelf to both. He was equally diftinguiihed by his implicit sub- mission to command, as by his impetuous courage, and by the ability of his conduat in every emergence. He had even then probably directed his views to the succession which was likely to fall into weak or incapable hands, and saw of what consequence the Romans might prove in deciding his fortunes. He had studied their character, and had already marked out the line he was to follow in conduc- ting his affairs with them. They appeared to be a number of sovereigns aflembled together, able in council and formidable in the field; but, in comparison to the Africans in general, open, un- designing and simple. With the pride of monarchs they began, he imagined, to feel the indigence of courtiers, and were to be moved by considerations of interest rather than force. His commissioners were now accordingly furnished with ample pre- sents, and with the means of gratifying the prin- cipal persons at Rome in a manner that was suited
C 4 to
c H A P. to their respective ranks and to their influence in
XI. the itate.
In the choice of this plan Jugurtha, like most politicians that iefine too much, had formed a system with great ingenuity, and spoke of it with a specious wit; but had not taken into his ac- count the whole circumitances of the cafe in which he engaged. Rome, he used to fay, was a city to be fold. But he forgot that, though many Ro- mans could be bought, no treasure was sufficient to buy the republic; that to buy a few, made it necefiary for him to buy many more; that as he raised expectations, the number of expetants in- creased without limit; that the more he gave, the more he was still expected to give; that in a state which was broke into factions, if he gained one par- ty by his gifts, that alone would be sufficient to rouse up another against him. And accordingly, after lavishing his money to influence the councils of Rome, he was obliged to have recourse to arms at last, and to contend with the forces of the re- public, after he had exhausted his own treasure in attempting to corrupt her virtue.
Although this adventurer had his abettors at Rome, such was the injuitice of his cause, or the sus- picion of treachery in those who espoused it, that they durst not openly avow their intentions. They endeavoured to suspend the resolutions which were in agitation against him, and had the matter re- ferred to ten commissioners who should go into Africa, and in pretence of the parties fettle the
differences
differences which subsisted between them. There c H A P.
XI. indeed he was supposed to have praftifed his art '---. on the Roman commissioners with better success than he had experienced with the Senate and People. He prevailed upon these commissioners to agree to a partition of the kingdom, and to fa- vour him in the lot which ihould be assigned to himself: knowing that force must ultimately de- cide every controversy which might arise on the subjec, he made choice, not of the richeit, but of the most warlike division; and indeed had al- ready determined that, as soon as the Romans were gone from Africa, he ihould make an end of the contest by the death of Adherbal; trusting that, by continuing to use the specific which it was said he had already applied, he might pre- vail on the Romans to overlook what they would not, on a previous request, have permitted.
He accordingly, soon after the departure of the Roman commissioners, marched into the territo- ries of Adherbal, ihut him up in the town of Cirta; and, while the Romans sent him repeated meflages to desist, still continued the blockade, until the mercenaries of Adherbal, tired of the hardships they were made to endure, advised, and, by their appearing ready to desert, forced him to commit himself to the mercy of Jugurtha, by whom he was immediately slain.
By these events, in about seven years from the death of Micipfa, Jugurtha attained the object which lie had so long defred ; but the arts which
procured
c H A P. procured him a crown, likewise rendered his slate
I. _ insecure. He was disappointed in his expectation
to pacify the Romans. The money he dealt went into the pockets only of a few, but his crimes rou- fed the indignation of the whole People. Prac- tifed statesmen or politicians are seldom directed in their conduct by mere feelings of injustice re- speding wrongs of a private nature. They have, or affect to have, reasons of state to set the confi- deration of individuals aside. The greater part of the Roman Senate accordingly, whether ating on maxims of policy, or, according to the scandal of the times, won by the presents of Jugurtha, received the complaints which were lodged against him with indifference; but the aflembly of the People, moved by the cries of perfidy and murder which were raised by the Tribunes, received the representations of his conduct with indignation and rage. Theef passions were inflamed by op- position to the Nobles, who were supposed to fa- vour the murderer. Neither the moit deliberate Statesman nor the most determined partizan of Jugurtha durst appear in his cause, nor propose to decline a war with that prince, although it was likely to be attended with considerable difficulties; and was to be undertaken at a time when a cloud hung over Italy itself on the fide of Gaul, a quar- ter from which the Italians always expected, and often experienced, the most terrible storms. u' . 6.7. About the time that Adherbal laid his com-
plaints againa Jugurtha before the Senate of Rome,
a
a new enemy had appeared. The north of En- c HAP. rope, or of Asia, had cast off a swarm of its peo- X pie, which, spreading to the south and to the weft, was first descried by the Romans on the frontier of Illyricum, and presently drew their attention to that fide. The horde thus in motion was said to consist of three hundred thousand fighting men, accompanied by their families of women and child- ren, and covering the plains with their cattle. The Consul Papirius Carbo was ordered to take post in Illyricum, to observe the motions of this tremendous host. Alarmed by their teeming to point towards the diftria of Aquileia, he put him- self, with too little precaution, in their way; and, unable to withstand their numbers, was overwhelm- ed as by a tempest.
This migrating nation the Romans have called by the name of Cimbri, without determining from whence they came. It is said that their cavalry amounted to no more than fifteen thousand; that it was their practice to despise horses, as well as the other spoils of an enemy, which they ge- nerally destroycd: and from this circumstance it may be argued, that they were not of Scythian extraction, nor sprung from those mighty plains in the northern parts of Alia, where military force has from time immemorial consisted of ca- valry, and where the animal they mounted was valued above every other fpecics of acquisition or property; and that they mult have been bred rather amongst mountains and woods, where the horse is not of equal service. On their hel-
mets,
CH AP. mets, which were crested with plumes, they car.
X _t ried the gaping jaws of wild beasts. On their
bodies they wore breast-plates of iron, had ihields painted of a conspicuous colour; and carried two miflile javelins or darts, and a heavy sword. They collected their fighting men, for the most part, into a solid column, equally extending eve- ry way: in one of their battles, it was report- ed, that the fides of this square extended thir- ty fladia, or between three and four miles. The men of the foremolt ranks were fattened toge- ther with chains locked to their girdles, which made them impenetrable to every attack, and gave them the force of a torrent, in fwveeping ob- firucions before them. Such were the accounts, whether well or ill founded, with which the Ro- mans were alarmed on the approach of this tre- mendous enemy.
Although, by the defeat of Carbo, Italy lay open to their devastations, yet they turned away to the north and to the westward, and keeping the Alps on their left; made their appearance again in the neighbourhood of Narbonne, or province of Transalpine Gaul, and from thence palled over the Pyrenees, alarming the Roman settlements in Spain, and keeping Rome itself in fufpence, by the uncertainty of the track they might afterwards choose to pursue. U. C. 642. Such was the slate of affairs, when the popular Pub. Cor- nelius, Sci- cry and generous indignation of the Roman Peo- pio aftica. L. ulpur- pie forced the State into a war with Jugurtha. nius, Pifo, eeftia. The
The necessary levies and supplies for this ser- CH AP. vice were ordered. The Consul Pifo was delti-- ned to command, and Jugurtha could no longer doubt that the force of the Roman republic was to be employed against himself; yet in hopes to avert the storm, and relying on the arts he had formerly praaifed, which were said to consist in the distribution of presents and money, he sent his own son, with two proper assistants, in quality of ambassadors to Rome. As soon as their arrival was announced to the Senate, a resolution of this body pased, that unless they brought an offer from Jugurtlha to surrender his person and his kingdom at discretion, they ihould be required in ten days to be gone from Italy.
This resolution being made known to the son of Jugurtha, he presently withdrew, and was soon followed by a Roman army, which had been al- ready prepared to embark for Africa. The war was conduced at first with great vivacity and success: but Jugurtha, by offering great public concessions or private gratifications, prevailed on the Consul to negociate. It was agreed, that, upon receiving a proper hostage on the part of the Romans, the king himself fllould repair to their camp, in order to conclude the treaty. In the ar- ticles which were made public, the king agreed to surrender himself at discretion, and to pay a large contribution in horses, corn, elephants, and money; but in secret articles, which were drawn up at the fame time, the Consul engaged that the person of
the
CHAP. the king should be safe, and that the kingdom of _. _Numidia should be secured to him.
During these tranfadions the time of the ex- piration of Pifo's command drew near, and he himself was called into Italy to preside at the ap- proaching eletions. His report of the treaty with Jugurtha was received with suspicion, and the cry of corruption resumed by the popular party.
Where is this captive ?" said the Tribune Mem- mius; " if he have surrendered himself, he will
obey your commands; fend for him; queflion " him in refpeat to what is pail. If he refuse to ^' come, we shall know what to think of a treaty ' which brings impunity to Jurgurtha, princely <' fortunes to a few private persons, mortification
and infamy to the Roman republic." Upon this motion the Prator Cassius Longinus, a person of approved merit and unihaken integrity, was haRtened into Africa, with positive inftrudions to bring the king of Numidia to Rome. By the safe conduct which Caflus brought on the part of the republic, and by his own assurances of pro- tection, Jugurtha was prevailed on to commit him- self to the faith of the Romans. He accordingly laid aside his kingly fiate, dismissed his attendants, and set out for Italy, determined to appear as a suppliant at Rome. Upon his arrival, being call- ed into the public assembly, Memmius proposed to interrogate him on the subject of his supposed izcrct transaction with certain members of the Se- nate ; but here Bebius, another of the Tribunes,
interposed
interposed his negative; and, notwithitanding that c H A P. the People exclaimed, and even menaced, this XL Tribune persisted. And before this obftru&ion to the further examination of Jugurtha could be re- moved, an incident took place, which occasioned his sudden departure from Italy.
Maffiva, the son of Guluffa, being the grandson and natural representative of Massinissa, and the only person beside Jugurtha who remained of the royal line of Numidia, had been persuaded by AI- binus, the Consul eleted for the ensuing year, to fRate his own pretensions before the Roman Senate, and to lay claim to the crown. Jugurtha, though at Rome, and in the power of those who were likely to resent any insult that was offered to their govern- ment, gave a specimen of the bold and sanguinary counsels to which he was inclined, employing against his competitor the ordinary arts of an African court, had him aflaffinated. The crime was traced to its author, but the safe conduct he had received could not be violated; and he was only commanded, without delay to depart from Italy. On this oc- cafion he left Rome with that memorable faying; " Here is a city to be fold, if any buyer can be " found."
The Consul Albinus soon followed Jugurtha, to u. c. 643.
M. Minu- take the command of the Roman army in Africa; ciusl Rnfs, and being eager to perform some notable adion andPo- before the expiration of his year, which was fast nu. approaching, he pressed on the king of Numidia, with all the forces he could assemble in the pro-
vince;
/
c H A P. vince; but found that he had to do with an enemy . ' ., who had the art to elude his impetuosity, and
from whose apparent conduct no judgment could be formed of his real designs. This artful war- rior often advanced with a seeming intention to hazard a battle, when he was molt resolved to decline it; or he himself precipitantly fled, when his design was to rally and take advantage of any disorder his enemy might incur in a too eager pursuit. His offers of submission, or his threats, were equally fallacious; and he used, perhaps in common with other African princes, means to mislead his antagonist, which Europeans, antient as well as modern, have in general condemned. He made solemn capitulations and treaties with a view to break them, and confidered breach of faith no more than a feint or an ambufl, as a Itra- tagem licensed in war. The Europeans have al- ways termed it perfidy to violate the faith of a trea- ty, the Africans held it flupidity to be caught in the inare.
By the artifices of Jugurtha accordingly, or by the remissness ofthofe who were opposed to him, the war was protracted for another year, and the Con- ful, as the time of election drew near, was recalled, as usual, to preside in the choice of his successor. At his arrival the city was in great agitation. The cry of corruption, which had been raised against many of the Nobles, on account of their supposed correspondence with Jugurtha, gave an advantage to the popular party, and they deter-
mined
mined to improve it, by raising prosecutions to CHA P. the ruin of persons, either odious to the People, or obnoxious to the Equestrian order, who then had the power of judicature in their hands . Three inquisitors were accordingly named by special commifion to take cognizance of all complaints of corruption that should be brought before them; and this commission was instantly employed to harass the Nobility, and to revenge the blood which had been fled in the late popular tumults. Lucius Calpurnius Pifo, Beftia, C. Cato, Spurius Albinus, and L. Opimius, all of consular dignity, fell a sacrifice on this occasion to the popular re- fentment. The Tribune Mamilius, upon whose motion this tribunal had been erected, with his associates, apprehending that, upon the expiration of their trust, the heat of the prosecutions might abate, moved the People that they might be con- tinued in their office; and, upon finding them- selves opposed by the influence of the Senate and the ordinary magistrates, they suspended, by vir- tue of their tribunitian prerogative, the election of Consuls, and for a whole year kept the republic in a fiate of absolute anarchy.
In this interval Aulus Albinus, who had been left by his brother, the late Consul, in the com- mand of the army in Africa, determined to im- prove the occasion by some memorable action. He left his quarters in the winter, and marched far into the country, hoping that by force or fur-

XI. __e., treasures and military stores. Jugurtha encouraged
him in this design, affected fear, retired with pre- cipitation wherever the Romans presented them- selves; and, to increase the presumption of their general, sent frequent meifages to implore his pity.
He at the fame time endeavoured to open a correspondence with Thracians and other irregu- lars, by whom the Roman army was attended. Some of these he corrupted; and, when he had drawn his enemy into a difficult fituatioi, and pre- pared his plan for execution, he suddenly advan- ced in the night; and the avenues to the Roman fiation being occupied, as he expeCted, by the Thracians and Ligurians whom he had corrupted, and by whom he was suffered to pass, he surprised the legions in their camp, and drove them from thence in great confusion to a neighbouring height, where they enjoyed during the night, some respite from the attacks of the enemy; but without any resource for fubtiftence, or hopes of recovering their baggage.
In the morning Jugurtha desired to confer with the Praetor; and representing how much the Ro- mans, deprived of their provision and equipage, were then in his power, made a merit of offering them quarter, on condition that they would con- elude a treaty of peace, and in ten days evacuate h!is kingdom.
These terms were accordingly accepted: but the capitulation, when known at Rome, gave oc-
cafion
cafion to much indignation and clamour. It was c H A P.
XI. voted by the Senate not to be binding, and the ' .Consul Albinus,,in order to repair the loss of the Public, and to restore the credit of his own fa- mily, made hasty levies, with which he proposed to renew the war in Numidia. But not having the consent of the Tribunes to this measure, he was obliged to leave his forces behind him in Italy, and joined the army in person without being able to bring any reinforcement. He found it in no condition to face the enemy, and was content- ed to remain inative until a successor fiould be named in the province.
Resentment of the disgraces incurred in Numi- u. c. 644. dia, and fear of iinvafion from the Cimbri, who, Meteills having traversed Spain and Gaul, were still .on' 'jdunicus. their march, appear to have calmed for a littlesilanus. time the animosity of domestic factions at Rome. The consular eletions were suffered to praceed.; and the choice of the People falling on Quintus Cecilius Metellus and M. Junius Silanus, the first was appointed to the command of the army in Numidia, the second to observe the motions of the Cimbri on the frontiers of Gaul, and to turn them aside, if possible, from the territory of Rome. About this time those wandering nations had sent a formal merfage to the Romans, desiring to have it underfood on what lands they might fettle ', or rather, over what lands they might pass in mi- gration with their families and herds. No return

by force, overcame in battle the Consul Silanus, *and, probably without intending, to. retain any conquest, passed on their way wherever the asped of the country tempted their choice, .
Metellus proceeded to Africa with a confider- :able reinforcement; and, having spent some time ·in restoring the discipline of the army, which had been greatly neglected, and in training. his new levies to the duties and hardships of the service, he direced .his march to the.enemy's country, and in his way had frequent meflages from the king of Numidia, with profeflions of submission and of a pacific disposition: So much, that when the Roman army entered on the territory of this prince, they found the country every where pre- pared to receive them in a friendly manner; the people in tranquillity, the gates of every city left open, and the markets ready to supply them with necelfaries.
These appearances, with the known charader of Jugurtha, creating distrust, only excited the vigilance of Metellus. They even provoked him to retort on the Numidian his own infiduous arts. He accordingly tampered with Bomilcar and the other messengers of Jugurtha to betray their maf- ter, and promised them great rewards if they would deliver this offender into the hands of the Romans '-ither living or dead.
Jugurtha, not confidering that his known cha-
raeter
Pacer for fallehood must have destroyed the cre- c H A iP dit of all his own professions, even if he should at. X any time think proper to make them sincere, and trusting to the effet of his submissive metfages in rendering the enemy secure, made a disposition to profit by any errors they should commit, and hop- ed to circumvent and destroy them on their march. For this purpose he waited for them on the de- scents of a high mountain, over which they were to pais in their way to the Muthul, a river which helped to form the situation of which. he was to- avail himself. He accordingly lay concealed by its banks until 'the enemy actually fell in to the snare he had laid for them. And although the effect was not answerable to his hopes, he main- tained, during the greater part of a day, with the advantage of ground and of numbers, a con- test with troops who possesed, against his irregu- lars, a great superiority of order, discipline, and courage ; but not .having found the Romans, as he expected, in any degree off their guard, he was in the event of that day's action, obliged to de- part with a few horse to a remote or interior part of his kingdom.
This victory obtained over Jugurtha, appeared to be an end of the war. His army was dispersed, and he was left with a few horsemen, who at- tended his person, to find a place of retreat, or to chute a new station at which to re-assemble his forces, if he meant to continue the wiar.
The Numidians were inured to action. The frequent wars of that continent, the wild and un-
D 3 fettled
c I . P. fettled fiate of their own country, made the use of
, horses and of arms familiar to them: but so void
was the nation of military policy, and its- people so unaccufftomed to any permanent order, that it was scarcely possible for the king to fight two bat- tles with the fame army. If vicorious, they with- drew with their plunder; if defeated, they fuppo- fed all military obligations at an end: and in either cafe, after an ation, every one fled where he ex- pected to be soonest in safety, or most at liberty to avail himself of the spoil he had gained.
Metellus, after the late engagement, finding no- enemy in the field, was for some time uncertain to what part of the kingdom Jugurtha had directed his flight. But having intelligence that he was in a new situation assembling an army, and likely to form one frill more numerous than any he had- yet brought into the field, tired of pursuing an enemy on whom defeats had so little effect, he turned away to the richer and more cultivated- parts of the kingdom.. Here the plunder of the country might better repay his labour, and the king, if he ventured to defend his own territory, might more sensibly feel his defeats. Jugurtha perceiving this intention of the Roman general, drew the forces he had assembled towards the fame quarter, and soon appeared in his rear.
While Metellus was endeavouring to force the city of Zama, Jugurtha assaulted his carfip, and, though repulsed from thence, took a post, by which he made the situation of the Romans, between
the
the town on one fide, and the Numidian army on c H A P
Xi. the other, so uneasy, as to oblige them to raise the x siege.
This the Numidian prince thought a proper op- portunity to gain some credit to his pacific pro- feffiohs. He made an offer accordingly to fur- render at discretion, and actually delivered up great part of his arms and military stores; but this purpose, if ever sincere, he soon retra&ed, and again had recourse to arms.

But the success of Metellus did not haften the ruin of Jugurtha so much as his own mifcondud, in the jealous and sanguinary measures which he now took to suppress plots and conspiracies either real or supposed to be formed against his life, by persons the molf in his confidence.
Bomilcar, still carrying in his mind the offers which had been made to him by Metellus, and willing to have some merit with the Romans, into whose hands he and all the fubjedts of Jugurtha were likely soon to fall, formed a design against
D 4 his
c H A P. his master, and drew Nabdalfa, a principal officer
in the Numidian armies, to take part in the plot. They were discovered in time to prevent the ex- ecution of their design, but they made Jugurtha from thenceforward confider the camp of his own army as a place of danger to himself, render- ed him distrustful, timorous, and unquiet; fre- quently changing his company and his quarters, his guards and his bed. Under there apprehlen- lions, by which his mind was considerably difor- dered and weakened, he. endeavoured, by con- tinual and rapid motions, to make it uncertain where he should be found; and he experienced at last, that private assassination and breach of faith, although they appear to abridge the toils of ambition, are not expedient even in war; that they render human life itself, for the advantages of which war is undertaken, no longer eligible or worthy of being preserved. Weary of his anxious itate, he ventured once more to face Metellus in the field, and being again defeated, fled to Thala, where he had left his children and the most va- luable part of his treafurc. This city too, finding Metellus had followed him, he was obliged to abandon, and, with his children and his remain- ing effects, fled from Numidia, firit to the coun- try of the Getuli, barbarous nations, that lived among the mountains of Atlas, south of Numidia, and whom he endeavoured to arm in his cause. From thence he fled to Bocchus king of Mauri- tania, whose daughter he had married; and hav-
ing
ing persuaded this prince to confider his quarrel c H AP.
XI. with the Romans as the common cause of all mo- X. narchies, who were likely in succession to become the prey of this arrogant and-infatiable Power, he prevailed on the king of Mauritania to assemble an army, and to attempt the relief of Numidia.
Jugurtha, in conjunction with his new ally, di- rected his march to Cirta, and the Roman general perceiving his intention, took post to cover that place. But while he was endeavouring, by threats or persuasions, to detach.the king of Mauritania from Jugurtha, .he received information from Rome, that he himself was superseded in the com- mand of the army; and from thenceforward, un- der pretence of meflages and. negotiations that were paffing.between the parties, protracted the war, and possibly inclined to leave it with all its difficulties entire, to his successor. His dismission was the more. galling to himself, that it was ob- tained. in favour of Caius Marius, who, having served under him in this war, had with. great dif- ficulty,..and not without some expression of.ecorn on the part of his general, obtained leave to de- part for Rome, where he meant to fiand for the Consulship. He accordingly appeared in the ca- pacity of candidate for this honour, and by vaunt- ing, inflead of concealing, the obscurity of his birth; by inveighing against the whole order of Nobility, their dress, their city manners, their Greek learning, their family images, the stress they laid on the virtue of their ancestors to com-

Metellus, and by promising a speedy ifiue to the war, if it Ihould be entrusted to himself; a pro- mise, to which the force and ability he had fiewn in all the stations he had hitherto filled, procured. him much credit; he so far won upon the People, that, in opposition to the interest of the Nobles, and to the influence of all the leading men of the Senate, he prevailed in the election His promotion was in a particular manner offensive to Metellus, whose reputation he had attacked, and to whom,. by an express order of the People, in contempt of a different arrangement made by the Senate, he was now to succeed. U. c. 646. Upon the nomination of Marius, the party who' L. Cafflus Longinus, had opposed his preferment, did not attempt to with- C. Marius. hold the reinforcements which he asked for the ser-
vice in which he was to command. They even hoped to increase his difficulties, by suffering him to augment the military establishment of his pro- vince. The wealthier or more refpetable class of the People alone were yet admitted into the legions; and being averse to such distant services, were likely to conceive a dislike to the persons by whom they were dragged from home. Ma- rius, therefore, in making his levies, his opponents supposed, might lose some part of the popular fa- vour which he now enjoyed, and become less for- midable to his rivals in the State. But this crafty and daring adventurer, by flighting the laws which
excluded
excluded the nec'essitous citizens from serving in CH A P. the legions, found in this class of the People, a T. X numerous and willing recruit. They crowded to his standard, and filled up his army without delay, and even without offence to those of a better con- dition, who were pleased with the relief they ob- tained from this part of their public burdens.
This circumflance is quoted as a remarkable and dangerous innovation in the Roman.State, and is frequently mentioned among the Rteps which hastened its ruin. The example, no doubt, with its consequences, may inftru6t nations to diftin- guiih the military operations required at a di- fiance, from the more important objec of prefer- vation and home-defence; so that in declining the distant service, the more refpedable orders of the People may not think it necessary to abandon themselves to depredation at home. In the first ages of Rome, the citizens in political convention, were styled the Army of their Country, and such in every age is the army in wlhofe hands the freedom of nations is secure. From the date of there le- vies at Rome, the sword began to pass from the hands of those who were interested in the prefer- vation of the republic, into the hands of others who were willing to make it a prey. The cir- cumfiances of the times were such, indeed, as to give warning of the change. The service of a legionary soldier abroad, was become too severe for those of the People who could live at their cafe, and it now opened to.the necessitous a prin-
cipal
CHAP. cipal road to profit, as well as honour. Marius,
- to facilitate his levies, was willing to gratify both ;
and thus gave beginning to the formation of armies who were ready to fight for or against the laws Qs their country, and who, in the sequel, fubfti- tuted battles in the itreets of Rome, for the blood- lss contefis which, in the early ages of Rome. had arisen from the divisions of party.
The new Coniul, unrivalled in the favour of the People, obtained whatever he required; and, be- ing completely provided for the service to which he was destined, embarked for Africa, and with a great reinforcement, in a few days arrived at Uttica. Upon his arrival, the operations of the war were resumed, and carried into the wealthieR provinces of Numidia, where he encouraged his army with the hopes of spoil. The new levies though composed of persons hitherto untrained and even excluded from the military service, were formed by the example of the legions already in the field, and who were now well apprised of their own superiority to the African armies. Boc- chus and Jugurtha, upon the approach of this enemy, thought proper to separate, and took dif- ferent routes into places of safety in the more difficult and inaccessible parts of the country.
This reparation was made at the suggestion of Jugurtha, who alleged that, upon their appearing to despair, and to discontinue all offensive opera- tions, the Roman general would become more fe- cure, and more open to surprise. But Marius,
without
without abating his vigilance, prefled where the c HAP. enemy gave way, over-ran the country; and took 2. possession of the towns they had left. To rival the glory which Metellus had gained in the re- dudtion of Thala, he ventured on a like enterprise, in the face of similar difficulties, by attacking Thapfa, a place surrounded with defarts, and in the midst of a land destitute of water, and of every resource for an army. Having succeeded in this design, he ventured, in his return to attack ano- ther fortress, in which, the place being-fuppofed impregnable, the royal treasures were lodged. This strong hold was placed on a rock, which was every where, except at one path that was for- tified with ramparts and towers, faced with steep and inaccessible cliffs. The garrison permitted the first approaches of the Romans with perfect security, and even derision. After some fruitless attacks, Marius, under some imputation of folly in having made the attempt, was about to desist from the enterprise, when a Ligurian, who had been used to pick snails on the cliffs over which this fortress was situate, found himself, in search of his prey, and by the growing facility of the as- cent, led to a height from which he began to have hopes of reaching the summit. He accordingly surmounted all the difficulties in his way; and the garrison being then intent on the opposite fide of the fortress to which the attack was directed, he returned unobserved. This intelligence he carried to Marius, ard undertook to be the guide
of
C H AP. of a detachment of chosen men, with an unufiual
XI. X I. number of trumpets and initruments of alarm,
who were ordered to follow his direcions. Ma- rius himself, to divert the attention of the befie- ged, and, on receiving a signal agreed upon from within, to be ready to make a vigorous and deci- five affdult, advanced to the walls. The Ligurian proceeded, though with much difficulty, to fulfil the expectations he had given. The soldiers who followed him were obliged to untie their sandals and their helmets, to fling their Ihields and their swords, and, at difficult parts of the rock, could not be persuaded to advance until their guide had repeatedly paced and repafied in their fight, or had found fRumps and points of the itone at which they could fasten ropes to aid their ascent. The summit was to be gained at last by climbing a tree which, being rooted in a cleft of the rock, grew up to the edge of the precipice. By the trunk of this tree the whole party passed, and, being as high as its branches could carry them, landed at last on the summit. They inflantly founded their trumpets and gave a sudden alarm. The besieged, who had been drawn to an opposite part of the walls to reiift the enemy who there me- naced an attack, were astonished with this found in their rear, and soon after, greatly terrified with the confuted flight from behind them of women, chil- dren, and men unarmed, and being at the fame time vigorously pressed at their gates, were no longer able to resist, suffered the Romans to force
their
their way at this entrance, and in the end to be- c HA P. come masters of the fort. xL.
While Marius was engaged in the siege of this place, he was joined by the Questor Sylla, who had been left in Italy to bring up the cavalry, which were not ready to embark at the departure ,f the Consul. This young man was a Patrician, but of a family which had not, for some genera- tions, borne any of the higher offices of State. He himself partook in the learning which then spread into Italy, from a communication with the Greeks, and had passed the early part of his life in town-diffipation or in literary studies, of which the last, though coming into fashion at this time at Rome, was confidered as a species of corruption almost equal to the firfl. He was yet a novice in war, but having an enterprising genius, soon became an object of respect to the soldiers, and of jealousy to his general, with whom he now laid the foundation of a quarrel fiill more fatal to the commonwealth than that which had subsisted be- tween the present and preceding commander in this service.
The king of Numidia, flung by the sense of what he had already loft, and expecting no ad- vantage from any further delays, determined, in conjuncion with his ally, to make a vigorous es- fort, and to oblige Marius, who was then moving towards his winter quarters, yet to hazard a battle for the preservation of what, he had acquired in phe preceding campaign.. The king of Maurita-
nia,
C H A P. nia, upon the late events of the war, had been in-
XI '- -l. dined to return to his neutrality, or to enter on
a separate treaty with the Romans; but being proimifed a third part of the kingdom of Numidia, in cafe the enemy were expelled from thence, or if the war should be otherwise brought to a hap- py cbnclufion, he once more advanced with his army, and joined Jugurtha. ' The prosperous state of the Romans, undifturb- ed for some time by any opposition from an enemy in the field, inspired them with some degree of negligence or security, by which they were ex- posed to surprise. Near the close of a careless march, and about an hour before the setting of the fun, they found themselves entering among scattered parties, who, without any fettled order, increased in their numbers, occupied the fields through which the Romans were to pass, and seem- ed to intend, by aflailing them on every fide, to begin the night with a scene of confusion, of which they might afterwards more effecually avail them- selves in the dark. In an action begun under there disadvantages, Jugurtha flattered himself, that the Roman army might be entirely defeated, or, in a country with which they were not ac- quainted, and in circumstances for which they were not at all prepared, being unable to effect a retreat, be obliged to surrender at discretion.
The king, with his usual intrepidity and con. duc, profited by every circumstance which pre- sented itself in his favour. He brought the troops,
of
of which his army was composed, whether Getu- c IHA P. lians or Numidians, horse or foot, to harass the --' enemy in their different ways of fighting, and wherever they could most easily make their attacks. Where a party was repulscd, he took care to re- place it; and sometimes affecEed to remit his ar- dour, or to flee with every appearance of panic, in order to tempt the Romans to break from their ranks. Marius, notwithstanding, with great dex- terity and presence of mind, maintained the form of his march; and, before night, got possession of some heights on which he could reft with safety. He himself, with the infantry, chose that which had the fleepeft ascent, and ordered Sylla, with the cavalry, to take his post on a fmnaller and more ac- ceffible eminence below. That his position might not be known to the enemy, he prohibited the lighting of fires, and the usual founding of trum- pets at the different watches of the night. The Numidians had halted on the plain where night overtook them, and were observed, at break of day, reposing in great security, and without any seem- ing apprehension of danger from an enemy, who was supposed to be flying, and who, on the prece- ding day, had, with some difficulty, escaped from their hands. In this situation, Marius resolved to attack them, and gave orders, which were passed through the ranks, that, at a general found of the trumpets, every man should itand to his arms, and with a great ihout, and beating on his shield, make an impetuous afflult on the enemy. The design,
VOL. 1I. E accordingly,
c H A P. accordingly, succeeded. The Numidians, who on ..__- former occasions had often affected to flee, were
driven into an acdual route. Great numbers fell in the flight, and many ensigns and trophies were taken.
After this victory, Marius, with his usual pre- cautions, and though it might be supposed that the enemy were dispersed, without remitting his vigilance, directed his march to the towns on the coast, where he intended to fix his quar- ters for the winter. Jugurtha, well apprised of his route, proposed again to surprise him be- fore he should reach the end of his journey; and, for this purpose, avoided giving him any premature or unnecefiary cause of alarm. He deferred his attack until the Roman army was arrived in the neighbourhood of Cirta, supposed to be the end, of their labours, and near to which it was proba- ble they would think themselves secure from any further attempts of their enemy. In the execu- tion of this design, he, with the greatest ability, condudced his troops to the place of action, and there too made every effort of conduct and rcfolu- tion. But the match being unequal, he was ob- liged to give up the contest; and, with his sword and his armour all bathed in blood, and almost a- lone, is said to have left a field, in which, for the firif time, he had taken no precautions for re-af- fembling an army, and on which his Numidians were accordingly routed, in appearance, to rally no more.
Upon
Upon there repeated defeats, Bocchus despaired c H A P. *of the fortunes of Jugurtha, and sent a deputation -l to Marius, requesting a conference with himself, c. Atti7s
Serannus, or with some of his officers. He obtained an in- ji,'tus terview with Sylla and Manlius; but, upon their v7Ti's arrival, had taken no fixed resolution, and was fiill kept in fufpence, by the persuasion of those of his court who favoured the interest of Jugurtha. Ma- xius, being continued in his command, resumed the operations of the war, and was about to attack the only place which yet remained in the hands of the enemy. When the king of Mauritania, alarm- ed by this circumstance, took his resolution to sue for peace, he sent a deputation of five chosen per- sons, first to the quarters of Marius, and, with this general's permission, ordered them to proceed from thence to Rome. These deputies, being admitted into the Senate, made offers of friendship in the name of their malter; but were informed, in re- turn, that he must give proofs of his friendly dif- .position to the Romans, before they could rely on his professions, or -lilten to any terms of peace. When this answer was reported to Bocchus, he was not at a loss to underhtand that the Romans .wilied him to deliver up the king of Numidia in- .to their hands; and seems to have conceived the design of purchasing peace, even on there terms. .Sylla being already personally known to him, he -made choice of this officer, as the person with whom lhe would treat, and desired he might be sent to his quarters. The Roman QSelflor accordingly set
E out
C H P. out with a small party. On the way he was met
--v by Volux, the son of the king of Mauritania, with
a thousand horse: him he confidered as of doubt- ful intention, whether destined to a't as a friend or an enemy; but coming with professions of friend- ihip from the king his father, and with orders to escort the Roman Qupaftor, they proceeded toge- ther. On the second day after this jundion, Vo- lux came in haste to the quarters of Sylla, and in- formed him, that the advanced party had discover- ed Jugurtha pdóed on their route, with numbers through which they might not be able to force their way, and earnefftly pressed the Roman officer to endeavour his own escape in the night.
Sylla could no longer disguise his suspicions, and, sensible that he had imprudently, without hof- tage or other security, ventured too far on the faith of an African prince, proudly refused to alter his march; desired that the Mauritanian prince, if he thought proper, fmould depart; but informing him, at the fame time, that the Roman people would know how to avenge so public an insult, and would not fail to puniflh the perfidy of the king his father. Volux, in return, made firong protestations of in- nocence; and as the Roman Questor could not be prevailed on to save himself by flight, this prince insisted to remain, and to share in his danger. They accordingly kept on their way, pasTed in the view of Jugurtha with his party, who, though dif- posed to offer violence to the Romans, had yet some n'cm'furtes to prefferve with the king of Mauritania,
whos
whose son was in company; and thus while, con- c H A P. trary to his usual character, he remained undeci- _.., ded, the prey escaped him, or got out of his reach.
Jugurtha sent persons of confidence immediate- ly to counteract the negotiations of Sylla at the court of Bocchus; and each of these parties soli- cited the king of Mauritania to betray the other. The Numidians endeavoured to persuade him, that, with such an hostage as Sylla in his hands, he might still expec some honourable terms from the Ro- mans; and Sylla, on the other part, represented, that, as the king of Mauritania had offended the Romans, by abetting the crimes of Jugurtha, he must now expiate his guilt by delivering him over to justice. It was the inclination of this prince to favour his Numidian ally; but it was his interest, as well as his intention, to gain the Romans. While he was frill in fufpence, he gave equal encourage- ment to both parties; and, without being finally determined what he should do, appointed the Ro- man Questor and the king of Numidia to meet him without any escort, or number of men in arms on ei- ther fide, reserving, for himself, to the last moment the power of determining against the one or the other. BY the time, however, that the parties were met, he had taken his resolution, had placed a bo- dy of his own troops in ambush, and, before any conference took place, gave a signal, which his men underitood to be for seizing Jugurtha. The Nu- mid.ians, who attended their king, were slain; he himself was put in chains, and delivered up to 'ie
E 3 Roman
H A P. Roman Quaitor. Sylla, with the exultation of a
. successful hunter, received this lion in his toils;
and, though he lived to perform much greater actions, still appears to have valued himfilf most on the event of this tranfadion. He boasted £o much of his prize, that he became, from that mo- ment, an object ofjealoufy to Marius, and was con- fidered as a person advancing too fait in the fame career of renown '. It was understood among the Romans, that the commander in chief, upon any service, in any division or province of the empire, enjoyed the triumph for victories gained, even in his own absence, by his lieutenants, or by those who served under his command; and Marius probably thought that Sylla took more to himself than was due upon this occasion. The desire of being the person who put the finishing hand to any matter of great public concern, however accomplished, was not peculiar to these officers. It was an effet of the Roman policy in making the rewards of dif- tinction depend so much on events, without regard to the means which were employed to produce them. A circumflance, from which the citizens of this republic were as desirous of having the re- putation of successful adventures affixed to their names, as courtiers in modern Europe are desirous of titles, or covet badges of honour and marks of their sovereign's favour.
The war being thus at an end, Marius appoint- ed a thankigiving; and, while he was offering the
customary Plutarch. in MIaria et in Syl'a.
customary sacrifices, the news arrived from Rome c HI A '. that the People had dispensed with the law in his x'. favour, and again had eleaed him Consul for the following year. This choice was determined by the great alarm which the Romans had taken on the approach of the barbarous nations, who, like a meteor, had, for some years, traversed the regions of Europe, and, with uncertain direction, were said to deflroy wherever they moved. The Romans had repeatedly stood in their way, and had provoked a resentment, which these barbarians were supposed, in haste, to wreck upon Italy. They were at firit heard of under the name only of Cimbri; but were now known to consist of many nations, un- der the appellations of Ambrones, Teutones, Tec- tofagi, and others; and had gained acceflions of force by the junaion of the Tigurini, and other Gaulish nations, who, either by choice or compul- sion, were made a part in this mighty host, whose movements the Romans conlidered as now chiefly directed againit themselves.

P Rutilius Carbo and Silanus, which had fallen victims to this Rufus, Cn. barbarous enemy, other considerable bodies, under Malius. Scaurus and Cassius, had perished by their hands; and other misfortunes, from the fame quarter, were coming apace. At the time thatMarius had finished the war with Jugurtha, Quintus Servius Caepio, ha- ving the'former year commanded in Gaul, where he destroyed or pillaged the city of Tolofa, and made a great booty, consisting, according to Juftin,
E 4 of
c H A P. of one hundred thousand pounds weight of gold,
X-I. and one million five hundred thousand pounds
weight of silver, was now, in his turn, to meet with this torrent of wandering nations; the Consul Mal- lius or Manilius had orders to join him; and all the troops they could assemble were but too few to withstand such an enemy. These generals united their forces on the Rhone, but without a proper disposition to ad in concert; they were according- ly defeated in battle; eighty thousand Romans, amongIt whom were the two sons of the Consul Manilius, were killed in the acion; forty thousand attendants of the army were maafacred in cold blood. Both camps were taken.
After this victory, the lords of the Cimbri, being assembled in council, called before them Aurelius Scaurus, formerly a Roman Consul, lately second in command over one of their vanquished ar- mies, and now a prisoner. They questioned him with refpet to the forces in Italy, and the route to be taken across the Alps: To these questions he made answer, That itwould be in vain for them to invade that country: that the Romans, on their own territory, were invincible. And, in return to these words, it is said, that a Barbarian firuck the prisoner with his dagger to the heart. It is fur- ther said of this barbarous council, that they came to a resolution to spare no prisoners, to destroy the ipoils of the slain, to cast all the treasures of gold and lilver into the nearest river, to deltroy all hor- fes with their saddles and furniture, and to save no
booty
booty whatever. It must be confessed, that in this, c HAP. their resolutions were guided by a policy well x . accommodated to the manner of life they had chosen. Wealthy poifeffions frequently disqualify even fettled nations for the toils of war, but to hordes in continual migration, the accommodations of luxury and sloth, would be certain impediments and the means of ruin .
These accounts of impending enemies, and of the disasters which besel the Roman armies which ventured to encounter them, were received at Rome with amazement and terror. The citizens changed their dress, and aifumed the military habit. Ru- tilius, the Consul, who had remained in the admi- niftration of affairs in Italy, had inftrudtions from the Senate .to array every person that was fit to bear arms. No one who had attained the military age was exempted. It is mentioned, that the ion of the Consul himself was turned into the ranks of a legion. There was little time to train such levies; and the usual way was thought insufficient. The fencing-mailers, employed to train gladiators for the public shews, were brought forth, and diftri- buted to inftruft the citizens in the use of their weapons 2. But the expedient, on which the People chiefly relied for deliverance from the dangers which threatened them, was the repeated nomina- tion of Marius to command againit this terrible enemy.
This officer, upon hearing of his re-eleCion, set out for Italy, and, with his legions and their cap-
tives, 1 Orofius, lib. v. c. I6. Eutrop. lib, v. z Valer. Max; lib. ii. c. 3.
c H A P. tives, made his entrance at Rome in triumph; a spec-
x. tacle, of which Jugurtha, in chains, with his unfor-
tunate children, were the principal figures. When the procession was over, the captive king was led to a dungeon, under orders for his immediate execu- tion. As he was about to be stripped of his orna- ments and robes, the executioner, in haste to pluck the pendants from his ears, tore away the flesh, and thrust him naked into a circular aperture into which he descended with a smile, faying, " What a cold " bath is here?" He pined about fix days under ground, and expired. A king and an able comman- der would, in such a situation, have been an object ofrefped and of pity, if we did not recollect, that he was the murderer of Adherbal and Hiempfal, the innocent children of his benefador ; and if we did not receive some consolation from being told, that his own children, who were likewise innocent, were exempted from the lot of their father, and honourably entertained in Italy.
Marius, in this triumph, is said to have brought into the treasury three thousand and seven pounds, or thirty thousand and seventy ounces of gold, and fifty-feven thousand seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver; and in money, two hundred and eigh- ty-feven thousand denarii 1. He entered the Se- nate, contrary to cufiom, in his triumphal robes, probably to insult the Nobles, who used to despise him as a person of obscure extration, born in a country town, and of a mean family: but finding
that . About L. ;o,coo,
that this was confidered as an at of petulance, and c H A P. generally condemned, he withdrew and changed v his dress.
The kingdom of Numidia was dismembered; part was put into the possession of Bocchus as a re- ward for his late services; and part reserved for the surviving heirs of Massinissa.

Being reputed head of the popular party, his personal elevation was an object of zeal to the Tribunes of the People, and was intended to mortify those wno affected the diftindions of antient family. Contrary to the usual form, and without casting lots, for the assignation of his Pro- vince, he was preferred to his colleague in the ap- pointment to command in Gaul. Having his choice of all the armies at that time in Italy, he took the new levies, lately aflembled and disciplined by Ru- tilius, in preference to the veterans, who had ser- ved in Africa under Metellus andhimfelf. It is pro- bable that he wvas determined in this choice, more by his desire to gratify the veterans, who wiflied

posed superiority in the discipline to which the new levies had been trained x
Upon the arrival of Marius in his province, it appeared, that the alarm taken for the safety of Italy was somewhat premature. The Barbarians in their battles only meant to maintain the reputa- tion of their valour, or to keep open the track of their migrations. They had found the lands, from about the higher parts of the Danube and the Rhine, through Gaul and across the Pyrenees into Spain, and to the ocean, convenient for their pur- pose, and sufficiently extensive. They had not yet meditated any war with the Romans, or other na- tion in particular; but did not decline any contest where they met with refinance. At present they continued their migrations to the westward, with- out attempting to cross the Alps, or teeming to have knowledge of nations who inhabited the pe- ninfula of Italy within those mountains.
We have nothing recorded in history concern- ing the movements of these wandering hordes, du- ring the two subsequent years, except what is re- lated of their adventure with Fulvius, a Roman Praetor, probably in Spain, who, in return for hof- tilities committed in his province, having made a feint to draw the attention of their warriors else- where, surprised and sacked their camp. Under the apprehension, however, of their return towards
Gaul z Frontius de Stragemzt, lib, iv, c. ?,
Gaul and Italy, Marius continued to be eleted CHAP. Consul, and was repeatedly named to the command X . of the army that was destined to oppose them. His party at Rome had, at this time, besides the exi- gency which justified their choice of such a leader, many other advantages against their antagonists, and maintained the usual contest of envy in the lower people against the pride of nobility with great animosity and zeal.

CHA1. THE Senate had, for some time after the sup- --1--v- _3 pression of the troubles which were raised
by Fulvius and the younger Gracchus, retained its authority, and restrained the Tribunes of the Peo- ple within ordinary bounds; but by the miicar- riages of the war in Numidia, and the suspicions which arose against them, on the subjeC of their tranfadtions with Jugurtha. they again loft their ad- vantage. It is difficult to ascertain the real grounds of these suspicions. Saluft seems to admit them in their utmost extent, and represents the whole order of nobility as mercenary traders, difpoied to fell what the Republic entrusted to their honour. That the presents of Jugurtha were Sometimes ac- cepted, and had their effe&, is not to be doubt- ed; but that the aristocracy of Rome, during its temporary ascendant, was so much corrupted, as the relation of this historian implies, is cfarcely to be credited. Such a measure of corruption must have rendered the State a prey to every rival that x'as in condition to mislead its ccuncils, and is not
consistent
consistent with that superiority which the Romans c H A P.
XII. then generally possessed in their negotiations, as. XI well as in their wars. The charge itself favours too much of that envy with which the lower class of the People at all times interpret the conduct of their superiors, and which at the time when Saluft wrote his history, was greatly countenanced by the partizans of Caesar, in order to vilify and traduce the Senate. We cannot, however, oppose mere conjecure to the positive tetfimony of Saluft, cor- roborated by some suspicious circumstances in the tranfations of the times. Among these we may recollea the patronage which Jugurtha met with at Rome, contrary to the general sense of the Peo- ple, and the uncommon presumption of guilt im- plied in the degradation of so many members as were about the fame time, by the authority of the Censors, Q Caecilius Metellus- and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus ', expelled from the Se- nate.
Whatever may have been the real occasion of the cry then subsisting against the Nobles, we have seen that the popular party, availing themselves of it, and giving it all manner of countenance, found means to recover great part of the power they had formerly loft. The Tribunes, having obtained the eftabliflment of a special commission for the trial of those who had received any bribes from Jugurtha, the people mistook their own ad

c H A P. in conflituting a court of inquiry, as sufficient to
Xl. cr evince the reality of the crime. The prosecutions
which continued to be carried on for two years, upon this supposition, served more than the sub- jea of any former dispute to exasperate and to alienate the minds of men from each other, and from the public. Questions were more of a pri- vate than of a public nature, and occupied the wvornl of the human passions, envy, malice, and re- venge. One party learned to cherish falsehood, subornation, and perjury; the other lived in con- tinual and degrading fear of having such engines employed against themselves.
The People, in their zeal to attack the Nobility under any pretence, made no diftindion between errors and crimes; and, contrary to the noble fpi- rit of their ancestors, treated misfortune, incapaci- ty, and treachery, with equal rigour. One Tri- bune had extended the use of the secret ballot in giving judgment on certain offences or mifdemea- nors'; another, upon this occasion, took away all diflintions, or introduced the fame cover of fecre- cy in the trial of capital crimes : insomuch, that a judge draughted from among the parties then at variance, could, without being accountable, in- dulge his malice or partial favour, so as to affect the life as well as the honour of a fellow citizen 3 to whom he bore any spite.
Laws were made to promote'the interest, as well as to gratify the animosity, of the lower people.

By the Agrarian law of Gracchus, no -one could c HA F, poflef. above a certain measure in land; but in or- .- der to render the surplus of property to be furren- dered immediately useful to the People, it was per- mitted, by an amendment of the law made during the low {tate of the ariftocratical party, that per- sons holding more than the legal measure, might retain their possession, but subjed to a rent to be collected for the benefit of the poorer citizens; and thus it was provided, that without difconti- nuing the practice of fadion, or removing into what was confidered as a species of exile in the country, the favourites of the party should be ac- commodated, and reap the fruits of sedition and -idleness, while they continued to pursue the fame course of life in the city1.
It was proposed, by the Consul Servilius Caepio, u. c. 647.

In wha-t- ever degree this proposal was adopted, it was again expressly rejeced upon the motion of Servilius Glaucia. And Caepio soon after experienced, in his own person, the animosity of the popular sac- tion: Being tried for micfarriage in his battle with the Cimbri, he was condemned by the judges, and afterwards, by a separate act obtained by Caf- fius, one of the Tribunes, declared, in consequence

Betides the transactions already mentioned, the following particulars, overlooked in the hurry of recording military operations and events, may serve fill further to characterize the times. M. Junius Silanus was tried for misconduct against the enemy; M. Emilius Scaurus, first on the roll of the Senate, was brought to trial for contempt of religion ; but both acquitted. The ardour for these prosecutions and popular regulations, con- tinued without abatement, until the second Con- fulate of Marius, when M. Marcius Philippus, one of the Tribunes, moved to revive the law of Tiberius Gracchus refpeaing the division of estates in land, which, from this circumstance, Ihould ap- pear had never been executed; and, in his speech to support this motion, affirmed, that there were not then two thousand families in Rome possessed of any property in land whatever2. This motion, however, was withdrawn,
Among the crimes which the populace were now so eager to punilh, fortunately that of pecu- lation or extortion in the provinces was one. To facilitate complaints on this subjed, not only per- sons having an immediate interest in the cafe, but all to whom any money or effects injuriously taken might have otherwise come by inheritance, were intitled to prosecute for this offence; and any alien, who convicted a Roman citizen of this crime, so

Domitius one of.the.Tribunes, attacked the ari- flocratical conflitution even of the priesthood, and endeavoured to transfer the right of election to va- cant places from the order itself to the People; but superstition, which often continues to influence the bulk of mankind after reason has failed, here flood in his way. The custom was against him; and in such matters, religion and custom are the fame. The People, therefore, it was confessed by the mo- ver of this reform, could not without profanation Lex Doni-
tia de Sa- pretend to elecr a priet ; but a certain part of the cerdotiis. People might judge of the candidates, and inftrud the college itself in the choice to be made 2. The fame artifice, or verbal evasion, had been already admitted in the form of electing the Pontifex Max- imus, presented to the order, not by the People at large, but by seventeen of the Tribes who were drawn by lot 3.
During this period, a charge of depravity, worse than that which was brought against those who were employed in the State, might with equal jus- tice be directed against those who were loudest in railing the cry of corruption; for liberty, on the part of the populace, was conceived to im- ply a freedom from every restraint, and to jus- tify license and contempt of the laws. The gra- tuitous aids which were given to the People, en-
F 2 abled a Cicero in Balbiana. 2 Afconius in Cornei.ana Ciccloni3. 3 Cicero de Lege Agraria.
CHAP. abled them to fuibfift in idleness and sloth; the
w .ealth that was palilng to Rome in the hands of traders, contracdors, and farmers of the revenue, was spent .i profusion. That which was acquir- ed by officers in one fiation of §ommand in the provinces, was lavished in public shews, in the baiting of wild beasts and fights of gladiators, to gain the People in the canvass for further prefer- ments : And from all these circumliances we may conclude, that if there be reason to regret or de- tell the abuses incident to monarchy, and the lux- ury of courts, there is surely no less in the brutal taste and dissolute manners incident to a populace, acknowledged in democracy the sovereign or fu- prcmc disposer of preferments and honours.
The severities which were praftifed in certain cafes, the sumptuary laws which were provided to relrain dissipation, were hut feeble aids to lop up the source of so much disorder. It is men- tioned, as an instance of severity which the times required, that some vestals were qucilioned for a breach of that sacred obligation to chafRity, under which they were held up as a pattern of manners to the ex at Rome ; that three of them were condemncd, and, together with so many Roman knights, the supposed partners in their guilt, fuf'ered extreme punifliment; but no two things are more consistent than fuperfliion and vice.

prayers were to be offered up in this temple, that c I A P.
XH1. it might please the goddess of Love to guard the chastity of Roman women '. And from this we may apprehend, that the devotions paid to this deity, were in orme instances of a purer kind than we are apt to imagine.
The term luxury is somewhat ambiguous; it is put for sensuality or excess in what relates to the tifes or gratifications of animal nature; and for the effet of vanity, in what relates to the decorations of rank and fortune. The luxury of the Romans, in the present age, was probably of the former kind, and sumptuary laws were provided, not to restrain vanity, but to govern the appetites for mere debauch. About the time that Jugurtha was at Rome, the sumptuary law of Fannius re- ceived an addition, by which Roman citizens were not only restricted in their ordinary expence, but the legal quantities and species of food were dif- tintly prescribed. The whole expence of the. table was reftrited to thirty asses 1 a-day, and the meat to be served up, to three or four pounds, dried or salted. There was no reftridion in the use of herbs or vegetables of any fort'. Ac- cording to A. Gellius, the law permitted, on cer- tain days, an expence of an hundred asses; on wedding-days, two hundred. It is remarkable, tha;sthis law continued to have its effet on the

. The Epicures of his time were obliged to make
up, in the cookery of their vegetable diet, what was defective in that species of food.
About the time of the commencement of the Numidian war, the People, according to the Cen- sus, amounted to four hundred and three thousand four hundred and thirty-fix citizens, fit to carry arms. At this time it was that the Censors, Quin- tus Caecilius Mettellus, and Cn. Domitius Aheno- barbus, as already mentioned, expelled thirty-two members from the Senate.
While the Romans were intent on the war which subsisted in Africa, they were not exempted from like trouble in other parts of their empire. In Spain particularly, hostilities, at intervals, were Rill renewed. There, in trying to quell a revolt of the natives, a Roman Praetor was killed; in another encounter, the forces employed against the natives, were cut off; and a frelh army was transported from Italy, to secure the Roman pof- sessions.
Hostilities were likewise continued on the fron- tier of Macedonia, by the Scordifci, Triballi, and other Thracian nations; and the Proconsul Ru- sus, by his victories in this quarter, obtained a triumph.
During this period, in the Confulflip of Attili- us Serranus, and Q. Servilius Cxepio, the year as- ter the first Consulship of Marius, were born two
illustrious r Ewilf,. ad Familiar. lib. xii. ad Gallurn.
illustrious citizens, M. Tulliits Cicero, and Cneiusc i A p. Pompeius Strabo, afterwards diftiriguiflCed by the i , appellation of Pompey the Great. And with the mention of these names we are now to open the scene in which persons, on whom the fate of the Roman empire was to depend, made their several entries into life, or into public business, and in which they began to pass through an infancy or a youth of danger, to an old age of extreme trouble, which closed with the subversion of that conftitu- tion of government under which they were born.
Marius having, without any memorable event, u. . 65c pafled the year of his second Consulship on the Caius Ma-
~~~- . ^rius 3tio. L, frontier of Narbonne Gaul, was, by the People, still Aurelius under the fame apprehension of the Cimbric inva- sion, re-eleced, and defined to remain in his fia- tion. This year likewise the Barbarians turned aside from the Roman province, and left the re- public at leisure to contend with enemies of less consideration, who appeared in a different quarter. Athenio, a slave in Sicily, having murdered his maf- ter, and broken open the prisons or walled inclofures in which slaves were commonly confined at work, assembled a number together, and being himself clothed in a purple robe, with a crown and sceptre, affected a species of royalty; while he invited all the laves of the island to aflume their freedom under his protection. He acquired strength fiuficient to cope with Servilius Cafca, the Roman Praetor, and actually forced him in his camp. He likewise defeated the succeeding Praetor, Licinius Lucul-
F4 lus;
c H A P. lus ; and was, in the third year of his infurrec-
y '. tion, with great difficulty, reduced by the Consul
Aquilius, This revolt was at its height in this- year of the third Consulship of Marius, and the rebels being surrounded in their itrong holds, and obliged to surrender for want of provisions, it was quelled in the second year after this Consulship 2 The whole is mentioned now, that it may not re- cur hereafter to interrupt the series of matters more important.
About the fame time the Romans had been ob- liged to equip a naval armament under Marcus An- tonius, known by the appellation of the Orator, a- gainft the Cilician pirates, who had lately infested the seas. All that we know of this service is, in general, that it was performed with ability and fuc- cess 3.
From Macedonia, Calpurnius Pifo reported, that the vicory he had gained over the Thracians had enabled him to penetrate to the mountains of Rho- dope and Caucasus.
Such was the state of the empire when Caius Ma- rius arrived from his province in Gaul, to. preside at a new election of Consuls. He was himself again, by the voice of the People,. called upon to resume his trust but he affedted, with an appearance of modesty, to decline the honour. His partizans were apprised of the part he was to ad, and were ac- cordingly prepared, by their importunities, to force
him x Florus, lib. iii. c. 2 Ibid. lib. i?. C. I*. .^ Ibid, li:. iii. c 6. Cicero :le Orator. lii'. r.
him into an office which he certainly did not mean c HA P. to decline. Among these, Apuleius Saturninus, at -L this time himself candidate for the office of Tribune, charged Marius with treachery to his country in proposing to desert the republic in times of so much danger; and with his reproaches seemed to pre- vail so far as to render this favourite of the Peo- ple passive to the will of his fellow-citizens, who wvifled to re-inflate ' him in his former command.
In this fourth Consulate, the courage and milil- u. c. Sr.
Caius Ala- tary skill of Marius came to be actually exerted in riuLsto L. his province. The barbarous nations, after their catlu,. return from Spain, began to appear in separate bo- dies, each forming a numerous and formidable ar- my. In one division the Cimbri and Tectofages had passed through the whole length of Gaul to the Rhine; from thence proceeded by the Danube to Noricum or Austria, and by the passes of Carin- thea, or by the valley of Trent, might have an easy access to Italy. The Consul Lutatius Catulus was stationed on the Athefis, near the descent of the Alps, to observe the motions of this body.
In another diviiion, the Ambrones and the Teu- tones, between the Garonne and the Rhone, hung on the frontier of the Roman province, and gave out, that they meant, by another route of the mountains, to join their allies who were expeccd on the Po.
Upon the approach of this formidable enemy in the division to which he nwas opposed, MP1a- i'ius took post on the Rhone at thj con.iuernct

C H A P. of this river with the Ifere, and fortified his camp
xI. in the most eftfetual manner. The Barbarians, re-
proaching him with cowardice for having taken there precautions, sent, agreeably to their own no- tions of war, a formal challenge to meet them in battle; and having had for answer, That the Ro- mans did not consult their enemies to know when it was proper to fight, they were confirmed in their usual contempt, ventured to leave the Roman ar- my behind, and proceeded in separate divisions to look out for a passage into Italy. Marius follow- ed; with rapid marches, overtook them in their progress, and even dispersed over the country, with- out precaution or order; some of them near to the Roman colony of Sextius ', and far removed from each other. Having found them under such dif- advantage, and in such condition as exposed them to slaughter, with scarcely any means of resistance, he put the greater part to the sword. Thus, one part of the hordes, who had for years been so formidable to the Romans, were now entirely cut off. Ninety thousand prisoners, with Teutobochus, one of their kings, were taken, and two hundred thousand were said to be slain in the field z, accounts which, with some others relating to this war, we may suspect to be exaggerated.
The news of this victory arriving at Rome, while

it was known that a second swarm of the fame hive, c H A P.
XII. not less formidable than the firfi, frill hung on the approaches to Italy, it was not to be doubted that the command and office of Consul would still be continued to Marius. The populace, incited by some of the factious Tribunes, joined, with the other usual marks of their attachment to this fa.. vourite leader, that of disrespect and insolence to those who were supposed to be his opponents and rivals. Of these, Metellus Numidicus, whom he had supplanted in the command of the army against Jugurtha, was the chief This refpedable citizen, being now in the office of Censor, one Equi- tius, an impostor of obfcute or slavish extration, offered himself to be enrolled as a citizen, under the popular designation and name of Caius Grac- chus, the son of Tiberius. The Censor, doubting his title, called upon Sempronia, the sifter of Grac- chus, to testify what she knew of this pretended relation; and, upon her giving evidence against him, rejected his claim. But the populace, ill-dif- posed to Metellus, on account of his supposed difa- greement with Marius, took this opportunity to in- fult the Censor in the discharge of his office; attack- ed his house, and obliged him to take refuge in the Capitol. Even there the Tribune Saturninus would have laid violent hands on his person, if he had not been protected by a body of the Roman Knights, who had assemblcd in arms to defend him. This tumult was fuippreffcd. but not with- out blood fld.
\Vliit.
C A P. While the popular faction was indulging in these
xIIr. marks of dislike to Mctellus, they proceeded to u. c. 653. beflow the honours which they intended for Ma- Caius MIa- tius to,M. rius, and chose him for a fifth time Consul, in con-
. junction with M. Aquilius. His late splendid fuc-
cesses against one division of the wandering Bar- barians juitified this choice, and pointed him out as the fittest person to combat the other, which was still expected from the banks of the Danube, to attempt the invasion of Italy. Catulus, the late colleague of Marius, commanding the troops that were Rfationed on the Athefis, to cover the access to Italy from what is now called the Tyrol and the valley of Trent, was defined to at in sub- ordination to the Consul, who had given orders to haften the passage of his victorious army from the other extremity of the Alps and the Rhone.
Catulus had taken post near Verona, thrown a bridge over the Athefis, and, in order to command the paifage of that river, had fortified flations on both its banks. While he was in this posture, and before the juncion of Marius, the enemy arrived in his neighbourhood. The amazing works which they performed might serve to confirm the report of their numbers. They obfiruc'ed with mounds of timber and earth the channel of the Athefis, so as to force it to change its course; and by this means, instead of themselves palling the river, they threw it behind them in their march. They continued to float such quantities of wood towards the bridge which Catulus had constructed, that the itream
being
being obitrudced, the bridge itself, unable to sustain c H A P. such a pressure, with all the timber which was ac- . cumulated before it, was entirely carried off. The troops of Rome, on feeing such proofs of the num- bers and firength of their enemy, were seized with a panic. Many deserted their colours, some fled even to the city itself, without halting. The Pro- consul, to hide his disgrace, thought proper to or- der a retreat; and by this order, seeming to autho- rife what he could not prevent, endcavoured to save in part the credit of his army.
The level country on the Po was in this man- ner laid open to the incursions of the Barbarians. The inhabitants of Italy were greatly alarmed: and the Roman People pased an ad of attainder against all those who had abandoned their colours. Marius, who had been at Rome while he exped- ed the arrival of his army from Gaul, suspended the triumph which had been decreed to himself by the Senate, now went to receive the legions on their approach, and hastened to rally and to rein- force the army of Catulus.
Upon their juncion, those who had lately fled from the plains of Verona recovered their courage, and the generals determined, without loss of time, to hazard a battle. It is said that the Barbarians of this division were lill igno- rant of the disaster which had befallen their con- federates on the other fide of the Alps, and had fen- the Roman army a defiance or a challenge to fight; but that, being informed of their loss, when
they
C H A P. they were about to engage, they made their attack -^ ' _ with less than their usual ferocity or confidence.
Catulus received them in front. Marius made a movement to assail them in flank; but as the field was darkened by the clouds of dust which every where rose from the plain, he miffed his way, or could not fall in with the enemy till after they had been repulsed by Catulus, and were already put to flight. The rout, as usual, was extremely bloody; an hundred and fifty thousand were said to be slain; sixty thousand submitted to be taken. The remainder of this mighty host, even the women and children, perished by their own hands; and in this manner a race of barbarous nations who had migrated through Europe, perhaps for ages before they encountered with the Romans, now appear to have been entirely cut off'.
On receiving the news of this victory at Rome, the city resounded with joy, and the People, in every sacrifice they offered up, addressed themselves to Marius as to a god. He had been constantly at- tended in this war by Sylla, who, though already an object of his jcaloufy, still chose to neglec the preferments of the city, and to serve in the camp. I:- tie i.'crcry, now to be celebrated, Marius was no more than parmer with Catulus, and impatient as he will soon appear of any competition for power, did juitice to his colleague in this particular, admit-

ting him equally to partake in the triumph which c H A P.
XII. ensued. In this procession there were not any car- - riages loaded with gold, silver, or precious spoils of any fort; but, instead of them, the ihattered armour and broken swords of a ferocious enemy; the furer marks of an honour justly won, and of a more important service performed. These were transported in waggon-loads, and piled up in the Capitol.

CHAP. TT'PON the extindion of the wandering na- XIII. L---. ,ll tions which had now for some time molefr-
ed the empire, there was no foreign enemy to en- danger the peace of Italy. The wars in Thrace and in Spain had no efect beyond the provinces in which they subsisted. The insurrection of the slaves in Sicily, by the good condut of Aquilius the Consul, to whom that service had been commit- ted, was near being quelled.
Marius, being now returned to the city, might have quitted the paths of ambition with uncom- . mon diftinCion and honour. An ordinary Con- iUlate, after his having bcen so often called upon,
in
in times of extreme danger, as the person most c HA P. likely to save his country, could make no addition XIL to his glory. His being set aside in times of fecu- rity and leisure, on the contrary, mufi have been the most honourable and flattering comment that could have been made on his former elections.
But there is reason to believe, that immoderate thirst of power, and extreme animolity to his ri- vals, not genuine elevation of mind, were the charaderiftics of Marius. His ambition had hi- therto pafled for an aversion to ariftocratical ufur- pations. But his affeced and furious contempt of family diftindions, too often the offspring of fenfi- bility to the want of such honours, by claihing with the eflablifhed subordination of ranks in his country, became a source of disaffection to the State itfclf. He formed views upon the Consulate yet a sixth time; and instead of the moderation, or the satiety of honours with which he formerly pre- tended to be aduated, when he hoped to be pref- fed into office, he now openly employed all his in- fluence, even his money, to procure a re-election; and in the event prevailed, together with Valerius Flaccus. He had warmly espoused the interest of this candidate against Metellus, from animosity to the competitor, whose great authority, placed in opposition to himself, he dreaded, more than 'c: from any regard or predilection for Flaccus. Antd: :. now being chosen, in order the more to ftrengthenli :, :. himself in the exercise of his power, he enterel into concert with the Tribune Apuleils Saturninus,
VOL,. I. G and,
C H A P. and, it is probable, agreed to support this fadious
_-.- demagogue in his pretensions to remain in office
for another year; a precedent which had taken place only in the moit fadious times of the repub- lic, and which was in itself more dangerous than any other re-election whatever. The person of the Tribune being sacred, his will was absolute, there was no check to his power belides the fear of being called to account at the expiration of his term; and if this fear were removed by the per- petuity of office, it was a power yet more formi- dable than that of the Dictator, and to be reitrain- ed only by the divisions which might arise among those who were joined together in the exercise of it.
The fadtion now formed by Marius and the Tribune Saturninus, with their adherents, was farther strengthened by the accession of the Pr.ae- tor Glaucia. This person, while in office, and as he fat in judgment, had received an affront from Saturninus, in having his chair of state broken down, for presuming to occupy any part in the attention of the People, while an assembly called by the Tribune was met. He nevertheless chose to overlook this insult, in order to be admitted a partner in the consideration and power which was likely to devolve on there popular leaders.
Upon the approach of the tribunitian elections, the Senate and Nobles exerted themselves to pre- vent the re-elecion of Saturninus; and nine of the new candidates were, without any question,
declared
declared to be duly elected in preference to him. c 11 A P. The tenth place too, was actually filled by the . - election of Nonius Sufenas, whom the ariflocracy 'had supported with all its influence. But the party of Apuleius, enraged at their difappoinrt- ment, had recourse to violence, forced Nonius, though already veiled with the sacred character of Tribune, to take refuge in a work-shop, from whence he was dragged by some of the late fo-l- diery attached-to Marius, and slain. The assem- bly broke up with the cry of murder, and every fober person, though reputed of the popular party, retired from the fiene under the itrongeft im- pressions of afflicion and terror.
Marius had reason to apprehend some violent resolution from the Senate, and was in no hafle to aflemble that body. Mean time his associate Glaucia, in the night, at the head of a party ar- med with daggers, took pofleffion of the Capitol and place of assembly, and, at an early hour in the morning, pretending to observe all the forms of eletion, announced Apuleius again Tribune, in the place that was vacated by the murder of No- nius. This furious demagogue was accordingly reinitated in the sacred charater, which, though recently violated by himself, was still revered by the bulk of the People. He was continually at- tended by a new set of imen who infefled the Itreets, freemen of desperate fortune, whom Ma- rius, contrary to the eftablifled forms of the con- .fitution, had admitted into the legions, there
G v were
c T A P. were grown fierce and insolent, as partners in the
. victories of their general, and w.ere now made to expect that, in cafe the popular party should pre- vail, they themselves were to have comfortable settlements, and estates in land.
Under the dread of so many assassins, who con- fidered the Nobles as enemies to their cause, Ma- rius with his faction was become master of the' commonwealth. The better fort of the People was deterred from frequenting the public assem- blies, and no one had courage to propose, that any inquiry fllould be made into the death of the Tri- bune Nonius, in whose person the sacred law ha4 been again set at nought'. TrLcxAga- Apuleius hastened to gratify his party by mo-
ving popular aas. One to seize, in name of the Public, those lands beyond the Po which had lately been overrun and desolated by the barbarous na- tions, and to distribute them in lots to the poorer citizens -.
Another, by which it was enacted, that in the province of Africa a hundred jugera a man ihould be distributed to the veterans 3 : that new fettle- ments should be made in Greece, Macedonia, and Sicily : and that the money taken from the tem- ple at Tolofa 4 should be employed in the purchafc

of lands for a like purpose: that wherever these c H A P colonies ihould be planted, Marius fllould have a ..XI.. power to inscribe, at each of the settlements, the names of any three aliens into the lilt of citizens 1. Le, Fru. That the price, hitherto paid at the public gra-nta naries, should be discontinued, and that corn ihould be ditlributed gratis to the People.
Upon the intention to obtain the last of those laws being known, Q: Servilius Caepio, one of the Quaftors, represented, that if such a law should pass, there would.be an end to industry, good or- der and government in the city; and that the trea- fury of Rome would not be sufficient to defray the expence. He exhorted the Senate to employ every measure to defeat this ruinous project. And this body accordingly. made a resolution, that whoever attempted to obtain the law in question should be deemed an enemy to his country. But Apulieus was not to be refirained by the terrors of this re- solution. He proceeded to propose the law in the usual form, and had planted the rails and bal- loting urns for the People to give their votes, when Caepio, with a body of his attendants, had the courage to attack the Tribune, broke down the steps, and overset the balloting urns; an ac- tion for which he was afterwards impeached upon an accusation of treason, but by which, for the present, he disappointed the designs of the fadtioni.
Apuleius, to extend the power of the popular
G 3 assemblies, i Aut. de Vir is Illuftrbus in Saturn;no. i Aut. Rhetoricoramn ad Hrenniam;
c H AP. aflemblies, and to remove every obitrudion fronm
,l his own designs, brought forward a number of
new regulations. One to confirm a former fta- tute, by which the ats of the Tribes were decla- red to have the force of laws. Another, declaring it to be treason for any person to interrupt a Tri- bune in putting a queflion to the People. A third, obliging the Senate to confirm every aft of the Tribes within five days after such ad had pafled, and requiring every Senator, under pain of a fine, and of being struck off the rolls, to take an oath to abide by these regulations. While there motions were under debate, some one of the party who opposed them, in order to flop the ca- reer of this fatious Tribune, observed that it thundered; a circumstance which, upon the ordi- nary maxims of the Roman Augurs, was sufficient to suspend any business in which the People were engaged, and to break up their aflembly. " If " you be not silent," said Apuleius to. the person who observed that it thundered, " you will also " find that it hails." The assembly accordingly, without being deterred by this interposition of the auspices, passed ads to the several purposes now mentioned. The power of the Senate was thus entirely suppressed, their part of the legislature being reduced to a mere form, and even this form they were not at liberty to withhold. Marius called them together, and proposed that they should confider what resolution they were to take with refped to a change of so much importance,
and
and particularly with refpea to the oath which-c.H A P. was to be exacecl from the Senators, binding or _ obliging themselves to abide by the regulations now made. The old warrior is said, on this oc- cafion, to have pradifed an artifice by which he imposed on many of those who were present, and which afterwards furnithed him with a pretence for removing his enemy MIetellus from the coun- cils of Rtate. He declared himself with great warmth againrft taking the oath, and by his ex- ample led other Senators to express their dislike. Metellus, in particular, allured the aflembly, that it was his own resolution never to come under any such engagement.
While the Senators relied on the concurrence of Marius in refuting the oath, the time appointed for adminiftring it nearly approached; and this Consul, after the third day was far spent, assem- bled the Senate, set forth the dangerous state of the commonwealth; at the fame time expressed his own fears of the disturbances that might arise if the Senate refused to gratify the People in this matter, and while multitudes were assembled in the streets to know the iltue of their councils, he required that the oath should be adminiifred. He himself took it, to the afonifihment of the Senate, and to the joy of the populace, who, being assem- bled by Apuleius, founded applause through the streets.. Metellus alone, of all w\iho were present, refused to comply, and withflood all the intrea- ties of his friends, who represented the danger
G 4 with
H A P. with which he was threatened. " If it were al- -xmI. ", ways safe to do right," he said, " who would
"ever do wrong ? But good mlen are difinguijhed,
by choofing to do right even when it is leaJt for "theirfifety to do so."
On the following day the Tribune Saturninus entered the Senate, and, not being stopped by the negative of any of his own colleagues, the only power that could restrain him, dragged Metellus from his place, and proffered an ad of attainder and banifiment against him, for having refused the oath which was enjoined by the People. Many of the molt refpedable citizens offered their aid to defend this illustrious Senator by force, but he himself declined being the subjed of any civil commotion, and went into exile.
While the ad, which afterwards palsed for his banishment was preparing, he was heard to fay, " If the times should mend, I fliall recover my " station; if not, it is good to be absent from " hence." He fixed his abode at Smyrna, con- duded his retirement with great dignity during his exile, and probably felt as he ought, that any censure inflicted by men of a vile or profligate characer, whatever title they assumed, whether of Nobles or People, or of the State itself, was an honour.
In there tranfations elapsed the second year, in which Apuleius filled the office of Tribune; and, being favoured by a supineness of the opposite par- ty contraded in a seeming despair of the republic,
he
he prevailed yet a third time in being vested with c A P. this formidable power. To court the favour of , ' the People, he asseted to credit what was alleged concerning the birth of Equitius; and, under the name of Caius Gracchus, son of Tiberius, had this impostor associated with himself in the office of Tribune. The name of Gracchus, in this situation, awakened the memory of former hopes and of for- mer resentments. The Popular party had destined Glaucia for the Consulate, and appear to have left Marius out of their councils. This will perhaps account for the condut with which he concluded his administration in the present year.
At the elecion which followed, the intercit of the Nobles was exerted for Marcus Antonius and C. Memmius. The first was declared Consul, and the second was likely to prevail over Glaucia; when, in the midst of the crowds that were assem- bled to vote, a sudden tumult arose Memmius was beret and murdered; and the greater part of the People, alarmed at so strange an outrage, were seized with a panic, and fled.
In the night, it being known, that Glaucia, Sa- turninus, and the Qu.estor Saufeius, were together in secret conference, all the citizens who yet re- tained any regard for the commonwealth aflem- bled, in dread of what so desperate a faction might attempt. All the voices were united against Sa- turninus, the supposed author of so many difor- ders and murders. It was proposed, without de- lay, to seize his person, either living or dead: but
being
C H A r. being put upon his guard, by the appearance of a XIII. - ist Rorll so likely to break on his head, he thought
proper, with the other leaders of his party and their retainers in arms, to i'eize the Capitol, there to secure themselves, and to overawe the aflembly of the People. It was no longer to be doubted that the republic was in a fRate of war. Marius, who had fomented there troubles from aversion to the Nobles, would have remained undetermi- ned what part he mhould adt. But the Senate be- ing met, gave the usual charge to himself and his colleague to avert the danger with which the re- public was threatened; and both these officers, however much they were disposed to favour the sedition, being in this manner armed with the sword of the commonwealth, were obliged to employ it in support of the public authority. The Senators, the Knights, and all the citizens of rank repaired in arms to their standard. Antonius, Consul ele6t- ed for the following year, in order to prevent the entry of disorderly persons from the country to join the faction, was Rationed in the fiiburbs with an armed force I. The Capitol was inveited in form, and appears to have held out some days; at the end of which, in order to oblige the rebels to surrender, the pipes that supplied them with wva- ter were cut off2. This had the intended effect.

They submitted on such terms as were proposed to c H A p. them; and Marius being inclined to favour, had _X. them only confined to the hall of the Senate till farther orders. In the mean time a great party of citizens, who were in arms for the defence of their families, impatient of delay, and thinking it dangerous to spare such daring offenders, beset them instantly in their place of confinement, and put the whole to the sword '.
It was reported, though afterwards queflioned upon a solemn occasion -, that Caius Rabirius, a Senator of diftindion, having cut off the head of Apuleius, according to the manners of the times, carried it as a trophy, and had it presented for some days at all the entertainments which were given on this occasion, or at which he himself was a guest.
This was the fourth tribunitian sedition raised to a dangerous height, and quelled by the vigour and resolution of the Senate. Marius, who had been obliged to act as the infirument of Govern- ment on this occasion, saw his projects baffled, andi his credit greatly impaired. Plutarch relates, that he soon after withdrew from the city for some time, on pretence of a desire to visit the province of Asia, where his active spirit became bury in forming the project of new wars, for the conldut of which ihe

c H A P. was much better qualified than for the adminiftra-
XIII.
tion of affairs in peace.
Upon the suppression of this dangerous sedition, the commonwealth was restored to a slate which, compared to the late mixture of civil contention and military execution, may have deserved the name of public order. One office of Consul was U. . 652,. trill vacant; and the election proceeding without M. Anro- nius, A. disturbance, Pofthumius Albinus was joined to An- offihumius Albinus, tonius. Moit of the other eletions had also been
favourable to the Nobles; and the majority even of the Tribunes of the People recovered from the late disorders were inclined to refped the Senate and the Aristocracy, as principal supports of the commonwealth.
The firtt effed of this happy disposition was a motion to recal Metellus from banishment. In this measure two of the Tribunes, Q Pompeius Rufus and L. Porcius Cato concurred. But Ma- rius having opposed it with all his influence, and Publius Furius, another of the Tribunes, having interposed his negative, it could not at that time be carried into execution. Soon after, however, the fame motion being renewed by the Tribune Callidius, and Furius having repeated his negative, Metellus, fen of the exile, in presence of the Peo- ple, threw himself upon the ground, and, embra- cing the Tribune's knees, beseeched him not to withstand the recal of his father. The young man, from this action, afterwards acquired the Sir- namne of Pints; and the Tribune, inibolently spurn- ing this suppliant, as he lav on the ground, served
his
his cause by that act of indignity perhaps more es- c H A P. feelually than he could have done by lending a fa- XrI. vourable ear to his request. The People, ever go- verned by their present passions, were moved with tenderness and with indignation. They proceed- ed, without regard to the negative of Furius, un- der emotions of sympathy for the son, to recal the exiled father. The messenger of the republic sent to announce this ad of the People to Metellus, found him at Tralles in Lydia, among the spec- tators at a public show. When the letters were delivered to him, he continued to the end of the entertainment without breaking tne feals; by this mark of indifference, treating the favour of a dif- orderly populace with as much contempt as he had shown to their censure.
The Senate, in consequence of the distaste which all reasonable men had taken to the violence of the opposite party, having got the ascendant at Rome, were gratified, not only with the test of superiority they had gained in the recal of Metellus, but in the downfal also of some of the Tribunes who had been adcive in the late disorders. Publius Fu- rius, now become an object of general detefta- tion, fell a sacrifice to the law of Apuleius, which declared it treason to interrupt a Tribune in put- ting a question to th3 People. Being accused by Canuleius, one of his colleagues, of violating this law, he was by the populace, who arc ever car- ried by the torrent, and prompt for execution, prevented from making his defence; and, though
,
C HA P. a Tribune in office, was put to death. Decianus,
XIII. ,_ _ another of these officers, in supporting the charge
against Furius, happened to speak with regret of the death of Saturninus, a crime for which he in- curred a prosecution, and was banished . So strong was the tide of popularity now opposite to its late direction, and so fatal as precedents even to their own cause frequently are the rules by which violent men think to obtain discretionary power to themselves. The murder of Nonius was a pre- cedent to justify the execution of Apuleius, and both were followed by that of Furius. The law which had for its object the support of Apuleius in any measure of disorder or license, was now employed to support his enemies against himfell and his faction.
Amidst these triumphs of the ariftocratical par- ty, Sextus Titius, one of the Tribunes, still had the courage to move a revival of the Agrarian law of GCracchus. The proposal was acceptable in the aflembly of the People 2: And the edic was ac- cordingly pal'ed. But it was observed, that while the People were met on this business, two ravens were fighting in the air above the place of assem- bly, and the College of Augurs, on pretence of this unfavourable omen, annulled the decree 3. Titius, the author of it, was soon after condemned for having in his house the statue of Saturninus 4.

XIII. and having had an ovation or procession on foot _ for the reduCtion of the Sicilian slaves, was on the following year brought to trial for extortion in his province. He called no exculpatory evidence, nor deigned to court the favour of his judges. But when about to receive sentence, M. Antonius, who had pleaded his cause, tore open the vest of his client, and displayed to the court and the au- dience the scars which he bore in his breaff, and which were the marks of wounds received in the service of his country. Upon this spectacle, a sudden emotion of pity or respect decided against the former conviction of the court, and unfixed the resolution which, a few moments before, they had taken to condemn the accused.
Among the events which distinguished the Con- fulate of M. Antonius and A. Poftumius Albinus, may be reckoned the birth of Cains Julius Caesar, for whose ambition the feeds of tribunitian difor- der now sown were preparing a plentiful harvest. This birth, it is said, was ushered in with many presages and tokens of future greatness. If, in- deed, we were to believe, that Nature in this man- ner gives intimation of impending events, we mfould not be surprised that her molt ominous signs were employed to mark the birth of a per- fonage who was destined to change the whole face of the political world, and to lay Rome herself, with all the nations she had conquered, prostrate under the dominion of caprice and force, a Rfate

it fell to the lot of Didius. Upon his arrival in the Province, Dolabella, the Proprator, set out on his return to Rome, and, for his victories in Spain, obtained a triumph. Metellus remained in the adminifiration of affairs in Italy. ?.cx Cze;- The legislation of the present year is diflin- I-a Didia.
guifhed by an ad in which both Consuls concur- red, and which is therefore marked in the title with their joint names. The Roman People had frequently experienced the defect of their forms in the manner of enacting laws. Fatious Tri- bunes had it in their power to carry motions by surprise, to include in the fame law a variety of regulations, and, by obliging the People to pass or reject the whole in one vote, frequently obtained, under the favour of tome popular clause, acs of a very dangerous tendency. To prevent this abuse, it was now enacted, upon the joint motion of the Consuls Cacilius and Didius, that every proposed law should be made public three market days be- fore it could receive the assent of the People: that all its different clauses should be separately voted: and that it should be lawful for the Peo-
ple
pie to feleE a part, if they were not inclined to C H A P. adopt the whole I. v.
This law had a salutary tendency; and, though far from sufficient to prevent a return of the late evils, it served for a time to obflrud the course of tribunitian violence: but while the source was open, any mere temporary obftrution could only tend to increase the force with which it occasion- ally burst over every impediment of law or good order that was placed in its way. And the inlcf- ficacy of measures taken upon the fuppreflion of the late dangerous sedition to eradicate the evil, ihevws the extreme difficulty with which men are led, in moit cafes, to make any great or just re- formation.
It is fomelwhat singular, that about this time, in the midfl of so much animosity of the People to the Senate and Nobles, this superior and probably more opulent class of the citizens were the patrons of au- iterity, and contended for sumptuary laws, while the popular Tribunes contended for license and the abo- lition of former restraints. " What is your liberty," said the Tribune Duronius to the People, (while he moved for a repeal of the sumptuary law of Fannius), " if you may not enjoy what is your "own; if you must; be directed by rule and " measure; if you muLf be flinted in your plea- "fures ?-Let us. ihake off, I pray you, tllfe "musty remains of antiquity, and make free to

There is, during some years, a considerable deficiency in the materials from which our accounts are collet- ed; little more is recorded than the succession of C6nfuls, with the number of years that elapsed, and a few particulars, that ill supply the interval, of what passed in the city, or in the series of im- portant affairs abroad.

In the following Consulate the kingdom of Cy- c H AP. rend was bequeathed to the Romans by Ptolomy .--L Appion, the late king. But, as this People pro- sessed themselves to be the general patrons of li- berty, where this blessing was not forfeited by some ad of ingratitude or perfidy in their allies, they did not avail themselves of this legacy, leav- ing the fubjets of Cyrene to retain for some time the independence of their nation with a species of popular government; and in this condition they were allowed to at the part of a separate State, until, under a general arrangement refpeding all the dependencies of the Roman empire, the terri- tories of Cyrene, among the rell, were reduced to the form of a province.

Times of faction were extremely favourable to this intrusion of firangers. Different leaders con- nived at the enrolment of those who were likely to favour their refpedive parties. And the f'e --

C H A P. tious Tribunes, however little they may have fa-
'---' voured the general claim of the allies to be admit-
ted as Romans, fondly espoused their cause, as mat- ter of opposition to the Senate, and as likely to open a more spacious field for their own operations; as they expected to raise the storm of popular animosity and tumult with the more ease, in pro- portion as the numbers of the People increased. By the as of Licinius and Mucius, nevertheless, a scrutiny was set on foot, and all who, without a juit title, ventured to exercise any privilege of Ro- man citizens, were remitted to their several bo- roughs '.
In this Consulate is likewise dated the trial of Servilius Cxepio, for his supposed mifcondut about ten years before in his command of the army against the Cimbri. He had exasperated the po- pular faction, by opposing the at of Saturninus for the gratuitous distribution of corn, and his ene- mies were now encouraged to raise this prosecution against him. The People gave sentence of con- demnation, and violently drove from the place of assembly two of the Tribunes who ventured to in- terpofe their negative in his favour. Authors, ac- cording to Valerius Maximus, have differed in their accounts of the sequel; some affirming that Capio, being put to death in prison, his body was dragged through the streets as that of a traitor, and cafl into the river ; others, that he was, by the fa-

C. Norbanus, who was said to be author of the riot which occasioned the condemnation of Cte- pio, and the supposed cruel execution of that citi- zen, was on the following year brought to trial himself for mal-administration and sedition in of- fice; but, by his own popularity, and the address of the orator Antonius, who pleaded his cause, was acquitted '.
The war in Spain fill continued ; and the Ro- mans, having gained considerable victories, sent ten commissioners, to endeavour, in concert with Craf- sus and Didius, to make such arrangements as might tend to the future peace of those provinces: but in vain; hostilities were again renewed in the following year.

Whether his neglec of political honours, during this period, proceeded from idle- ness, or from want of ambition, is uncertain. His character will justify either conftrudion, being equally susceptible of dissipation, and of the dif- dain of ordinary dilfincions. The People, how- ever, refused to gratify him in his desire of passing on to the office xf Pri-tor without being Edile; as they were resolved to be gratified with the magni-
H 3 ficent 3 Val ,Max. lib. iv. c. l. e Ciccro :k Or:,tor. lib. ii.
c H A P. ficent shows of wild beasts, which his supposed cor-
x. refpondence with the king of Mauritania enabled
him to furnilh. But to remove this objecion to his preferment, he gave out, that as Praetor he fliould exhibit the fame shows which were expet- ed from him as Edile: and having, in the follow- ing year, perfifled in his suit, he was accordingly elcted, and fulfilled the expectations of the Peo- ple; insomuch, that he is said to have let loose in the Circus one hundred maned or male lions, and to have exhibited the method of baiting or fights ing them by Mauritanian huntfnmen'. Such was the price which candidates for preferment at Rome were obliged to pay for the suffrage of the People.
In this variable scene, where so many particular men excelled in genius and magnanimity, while meaftures of State were affected by the caprice of a disorderly multitude, P. lutilius, late Quaefor in Asia, exhibited a fpecacle more than sufficient to counterbalance the lions of Sylla; and, if it were permitted in any cafe whatever to treat our coun- try with disdain, furnifed an instance to be ap- plauded of the just contempt with which the undeserved resentments of corrupt and malicious men may be flighted. Having reformed many abuses of the equefirian tax-gatherers in the pro- vince which he governed, he was himself brought before the tribun:l of an equestrian jury, to be tried for the crime he had refrained in others.
In
In this situation he declined the aid of any friend, c H A P. told the judges he would make no defence; but v XI.- stated the particulars by which he had offended his prosecutors, left the court to decide, and, being condemned, retired to Smyrna, where he ever as- ter lived in great tranquillity, and could not be prevailed on, even by Sylla in the height of his power, to return to Rome '. Great as the State and Republic of Rome was become, unmerited disgrace was certainly a just object of contempt or indifference, to the worthy person on whom it was inflicted.
The Proconsuls, Didius and CrafTus, were per- mitted to triumph for victories obtained in Spain, but had not been able to establish the peace of that country. The conduct of the war which broke out afresh in one of the provinces was committed to Valerius Flaccus, and that of the other to Per- perna, one of the Consuls. Flaccus, near the town of Bclgida, obtained a great victory, in which were ilain about twenty thousand of the enemy; but he could not prevail on the canton to submit. Such of the People as were inclined to capitulate, having met to deliberate on terms, were beset by their fellow-citizens, and the house in which they were alTembled being set on fire, they perished in the flames.

The Prntor Sylla, at the expiration of his of- fice, was frnt into Asia with a commifflon to re- llore Ariarathes to the kingdom of Cappadocia, which had been seized by Mithridates, and to re- store Pylamenes to that of Paphlagonia, from which he had been expelled by Nicomedes king of By- thinia. The Prator having successfully executed both there commifions, continued his journey to the Euphrates, where he had a conference, and concluded a treaty with an ambafTador from Aria- rathes king of the Parthians '.
From an ediE of the Censors, Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus and C. Licinius Cralfus, condemning the schools of Latin rhetoric -, it appears that the Romans, during this period, still received with re- luctance the refinements which were gradually ta- king place in the literary as well as in the other arts. ó" Whereas information," said the Censors in their edid, '" has been lodged before us that "schools are kept by certain persons, under the " title of Latin rhetoricians, to which the youth ( of this city rctort, and at which they pals entire

Cicero being now four- teen years of age, and employed in acquiring that eloquence for which he became so famous, was pro- bably involved in this censure, as frequenting the schools which, by this formal edict of the magi- ftrate, were condemned.

In the fame year a present sent from the king of Mauritania had near- ly produced a civil war in the commonwealth, or at least inflamed the paffons from which that calamity soon after arose. Bocchus, in order to remind the Romans of the merit he had acquired by delivering Jugurtha into their hands, had cau- ied this scene to be represented in a groupe of images of gold, containing his own figure, that of Jugurtha, and that of Sylla, to whom the unhappy prince was delivered up. Marius, under whose auspices this transaction had pastcd, being provok- ed at having no place in the groupe by which it was represented, attempted to pull down the images after they had been ereced in the place of their

C H A P. destination in the Capitol. Sylla was equally so-
-licitous to have them remain; and the contest was
likely to end in violence, if matters of greater mo- ment had not arisen to occupy the ardent and ve- hement spirit of these rivals.
The expectations of all parties at Rome, and throughout Italy, were now raised by the projects of Livius Drufus, an active Tribune, who, in or- der to distinguish himself, brought forward many lubjects of the greatest concern to the public. He acted at first in concert with the leading men of the Senate, and was supported by them in order to obtain some amendment in the law as it then flood respecting the courts ofjuftice. The Equeitrian or- der had acquired exclusive possession of the judica- Lex de Ju. ture. The Senators wified to recover at least a
d l share in that prerogative; and Drufus, in order to
gratify them, moved for an ac of which the ten- dency was, to restore the Senators to their place in forming the courts ofjuftice; and to prevent opposition from the Equestrian order, he proposed, at once, to enrol three hundred knights into the Senate; and that the Senators, who appear at this time to have amounted to no more than three hundred, might not withstand this increase of their numbers, he left to each the nomination of one of the new members; proposing, that from the fix hundred so constituted, the lifts of judges hould be taken . Many of the knights were recon-

oiled to this arrangement, by the hopes of be- H AP. coming Senators; but the order, in general, seem XII. to have confidered it as a snare laid to deprive them of their consequence in the government of their country; and individuals refused to accept of a place in the Senate, at the hazard of so great and so sudden a change in the constitution of the State, and in the condition of an order from which they derived their consequence .
This Tribune likewise proposed an ad to de- LexNum. base the silver coin, by mixing an eighth of alloy. But the part of his proje&t which gave the great- eft alarm, was that which related to the indigent citizens of Rome, and to the inhabitants of Italy in general.
With a view to gratify the poorer citizens he Lex de Co.
Ioniis. proposed, that all the new settlements, projected by the law of Caius Gracchus, should now be car- ried into execution. The Consul, Marcus Per- perna, having ventured to oppose this proposal, was, by order of the Tribune, taken into custody; and so roughly treated in the execution of this order, that, while he firuggled to disengage him- self, the blood was made to spring from his no- irils. " It is no more than the pickle of the tur- :' tle-fifh I," said the Tribune, a species of deli- cacy, in which, it seems, among other luxuries of

c H A P. the table, this Consul was supposed frequently to lk- . indulge himself. tex de Ci- For the allies of Italy, Livius Drufus proposed vicate So. ciisdanda. to obtain the favourite objec on which they had
been so long intent, their admission on the rolls of Roman citizens. In all his other proposals, he had the concurrence of some party in the com- monwealth, and by.perfuaflon, or force, had ob- tained his purpose; but in this he struck at the personal consideration of every citizen, and was opposed by the general voice of the People.
This Tribune used to boast, that he would ex- hauft every fund from which any order of men could be gratified, and leave to those who came as- ter him, nothing to give but the air and the earth r, The citizens in general, however, were become tired of his favours, and the people of Italy were ill-difpofed to requite the merit of a project, which, though in their favour, he had not been able to execute.
Soon after the motion which Drufus made for this great and alarming innovation, he was fud- denly taken ill in the public alTembly, and Pa- pirius Carbo, another of the Tribunes, made a ihort speech on the occasion, which, among a people prone to fuperftiton, and ready to exe- cute whatever they conceived to be awarded by the g ds, probably hallened the fate of his fal- ling colleague: " 0 Marcus Drufus!" he said, " the father I call, not this degenerate son; thou "who ufedft to fay, The commonwealth is sacred,
"whoever 1 i ruis, lib. iii. c. I'7.
" whoever violates it is sure to be punished. The c H A P. "temerity of the son may loon evince the wisdom - : ' of the father." A great fliout arose in the as- fembly, and Drufus', being attended to his own house by a numerous multitude, received in the crowd a secret wound of which he died 2. All his laws were Loon after repealed, as having passed under unfavourable auspices. But the inhabitants of Italy were not to be appeased under their late disappointment, and discontents were breaking out in every part of the country, which threatened to end in some great convulsion.
In this slate of public alarm, some pro.fecu- tions were raised by the Tribunes, calculated merely to gratify their own private resentments, and tending at the fame time to excite extreme animofities. Q. Varius Hybrida obtained a decree of the People, directing, that inquiry should be made by whole fault the allies had been made to exped the freedom of the city. In consequence of an inquest set on foot for this purpose, L. Cal- phurnius Beftia, late Consul, and M. Aurelius Orator, and other eminent men, were condemned 3. Mummius Achaicus was banished to Delos. Emi- lius Scaurus, who had long maintained his dignity as Princeps, or firfi on the roll of the Senate, was cited on this occalion before the People as a per- Ibn involved in the fame guilt. Quintus Varius,

C H A P. the Tribune, who accused him, being a native of XIIL MI- -Spain, Scaurus was acquitted upon the following
flort defence: " Q Varius, from the banks of "the Sucro, in Spain, fays, That M. Emilius " Scaurus, firit in the roll of the Senate, has en- " couraged your fubjeds to revolt; Varius main-
tains the charge; Scaurus denies it; there is no "other evidence in this matter: choose whom you "will believe '."
The year following, Varius himself was tried, and condemned in terms of his own atd; and while these prosecutions suspended all other civil affairs, and even interrupted the measures required for the safety of the public, the inhabitants of Italy were forming dangerous combinations, and were ready to break out in adual rebellion. They were exasperated with having their suit not only refused, but in having the abettors of it at Rome confidered as criminals. They deputed commis- tioners to meet at a convenient place, to concert their measures, and were speedily advancing to the effea of some violent resolutions.
The Romans took their first suspicion of a dan- gerous design in agitation among their allies, from observing that they were exchanging hoflages among themlflves. The Proconsul Servilius, who commanded in the Picenum, having intelligence of such proceedings from Afculum, repaired thither, in order, by his pretence, to prevent any commotion;
but 7 Cicsro pro i1.. Scauro iilio. Aut. de Yirim Il;fi. ribts, c. ',. Qiinti!il in, lib. , c I . 1 . ; V iz', I . lib. iii, c. 7.
but his coming, in reality, hastened the revolt. C A P. His remonitrances and his threats made the inha----- bitants sensible that their dcfigns were known, and that the execution of them could no longer be in safety delayed. They accordingly took arms, and put to the sword the Proconsul Servilius himself, with his lieutenant, and all the Roman citizens who happened to be in the place. The alarm im- mediately spread throughout all the towns that were concerned in the plot; and, as upon a signal agreed, the Marfi, Peligni, Veftini, Marcini, Pi- centes, Ferentanae, Hirpini, Pompeiani, Venufini, Apuli, Lucani, and Samnites, took arms, and in this menacing posture, sent a joint deputation to Rome, to demand a participation in the privi- lege of citizens; of which they had, by their ser- vices, contributed so largely to increase the va- lue.
In answer to this demand they were told by the Senate, That they must discontinue their assem- blies, and renounce their pretensions; otherwise, that they muit not presume to fend any other mef- Iage to Rome.
War being thus declared, both parties prepared U. C. 66. for the contest. The allies pitched upon Corfinium cx.:ir, P. for the capital of what they denominated theLupu !s I!alian Republic: they inllpituted a Senate of five hundred members; eledted two Consuls, with other civil and military officers of Rate, to replace the political government at Rome, from which they now withldrew their allegiance. lhey mui-
c H A P. tered in separate bodies and under different lead- x .I. ers, one hundred thousand men in arms . The
Romans now found themselves in an instant brought back to the condition in which they had been about three hundred years before; reduced. to a few miles of territory round their walls, and beset with enemies more united, and more nume- rous than ever had assailed them at once on the fame ground. But their city was likewise enlar- ged, their numbers increased, and every individual excellently formed to occupy his place in the State, either as a warrior or a citizen. All of them assumed, upon this cccafion, the fagum or military dress ; and being joined by fitch of the Latins as remained in their allegiance, and by such of their colonies, from different parts of Italy, as continued to be faithful, together with some mer- cenaries from Gaul and Numidia, they assembled a force equal to that of their revolted fubjeds.
The Consuls were placed at the head of the two principal armies; Lucius Julius CLefar, in the country of the Samnites , and Rutilius, in that of the Marii 3. They had under their command the most celebrated and experienced officers of the republic; but little more is preserved to furnish an account of the war besides the names of the Romian commanders, and those of tlhe pcrfons op- posed to them. Ruilius was attended by Pom- pcius Strabo, the father of him who afterwards

bore the title of Pompey the Great; Caspio, Per- c H A P. perna, Meffala, and Caius Marius, of whom the i. last had already so often been Consul. Lucius Caesar had, in the army which he commanded, Lentulus, Didius, CraiTus, and Marcellus. They were opposed by T. Afranius, P. Ventidius, Mar- cus Egnatius, Q Pompedius, C. Papius, M. Lam- ponius, C, Judacilius, Hircus, Affinius, and Vetius Cato, at the head of the allies. The forces were similar in discipline and in arms. The Romans were likely to be inferior in numbers and in re- sources, but had the advantage in reputation, au- thority, and in the fame of their leaders, employ- ed in the highest flations, and inured to command. But so well had the allies taken their measures, and with so much animosity did they enter into a quar- rel which they had been meditating for some years, that the Romans appeared at first unequal to the contest, and were surprised and overcome in fun- dry encounters.
The detail of these operations is imperfecly re- corded; and does not furnish the materials of a relation either interesting or inftrucive. We must therefore content ourselves with little more than a lift of ations and events, together with the gene- ral result.
One of the Consuls, Lucius Cefar, in the firit operation of the war, was defeated by Vetius Cato near Efernia, and had two thousand men killed in the field. The town of Efernia was imme- diately inveRted, and some Roman officers of di-
indlion were obliged to make their efeape in the V7eI. XI. I disguise
c H A P. disguise of slaves. Two Roman cohorts were cut -L-- off at Venafrum, and that colony fell .into the
hands of the enemy. The other Consul, Rutilius, was likewise defeated by the Marfi, and fell in the field, with eight thousand men of his army. His colleague was called to the city to prefidc at the election of a successor; but being neceffirily de- tained with the army, the office continued vacant for the remainder of the campaign, while the ar, my acted under the dircdion of the late Consuls, Marius and Caepio.
The corpse of Rutilius, and of other persons of rank, being brought to the city in order to have the honours of a public funeral, seemed to spread such a gloom, as to suggest a resolution in the Se- nate, which is probably wife on all such occa- lions, that for the future the dead ihould be bu- ried where they fell.
In the mean time, Lucius Cafar obtained a vic- tory in the country of the Samnites; and the Se- nate, in order to compose the minds of the People, which in this war were agitated to an uncommon degree, as if this viEtory had suppressed the revolt, resolved, that the fagum, or military dress, fiould be laid aside . xi. c. 664. The usual time of the Consular elections being Stabo", come, Cn. Pompeius Strabo and Porcius Cato were cLP'to. named. The first gained a complete victory over
the Marfi; and, notwithstanding an obstinate de-
fence, i Liv. lib lxxiv. Appian. Orofius, lib, v. . iS. Florus, lib. iii. c. iS. Vcllei'i. Eutrjpius.
fence, reducedd the: city of- Afeulum, where the CHAP. first hollilities took place, and where the Romlans x had fiffered the *greatest outrage. The principal inhabitants of the place were put to death, the remainder were' fold for slaves. The other C6n- fill, Cato, was killed in an attack upon the en- trenchmlents of 'the Marfi, and although Marius and Sylla, in different quarters, had turned the fortune of the war against the allies, yet the event still continued to be. extremely doubtful.
The Umbrians, Etruscans, and inhabitants of other diftrids of Italy, who had hitherto hesitated in the choice of their party, took courage from the perseverance and success of their neighbours, and openly joined the revolt. 'Ihe more distant parts of the empire were soon likely to receive the contagion: they were already, by the obftrudion they met with in carrying supplies of provisions or revenue, fevered from the capital, and they were likely to withdraw on the first opportunity, the al- legiance which they were supposed to owe as con- quered provinces.
Mithridates, the 'king of Pontus, did not ne- gldt the occasion that was offered to him, in this diftradion of affairs in Italy ; he put all his forces inllmotion, expelled Nicomedes froln Bythiniaa and' Ariobarzones from Cappadocia, and thus himself became master of the' greater part of the LefTer Asia.
In this extremity it appeared necessary at Rome to- compose the liforders of Italy, and no longer
2 to
CHAP. to withifand the request of the allies; but the . ' .Senate had the address to make the intended con-
cessions seem to be an aft of munificence and ge- nerofity, not of weakness or fear.
The Latins, who had continued in their alle- giance, were, in consideration of their fidelity, ad- mitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens. The Umbri and Tuscans, who either had not yet declared, or who had appeared the leaf acive in the quarrel, were next comprehended; and foie other inhabitants of Italy, observing, that they were likely to obtain by fivour what they endea- voured at so great a risk to extort by force, grew remits in the war, or withdrew from the league, that they might appear to' be forward in, the ge- neral return to peace.
The Marfi, Samnites, and Lucanians, who had been the principal authors of the revolt, or who had acted with most animolity in the conduc of it, continued for some time to be excluded from the privilege to, which they aspired, and which the Romans would not be forced to bellow. But the civil war, which soon after broke out among the citizens themlelves, terminated either in the extirpation of those obstinate aliens, and in the settlement of Roman colonies in their stead, or gave them an opportunity, under favour of the party they espoused, of gaining admittance to the freedom of Rome: so that, in a few years, all the inhabitants of Italy, from the Rubicon to the
Straits
Straits of Messina, were inscribed on the rolls of CHA UP. the People, and a constitution of state, which had x' . been already overcharged by the numbers who partook of- the sovereignty, was now altogether overwvhelmed; or if this change alone w-ere not sufficient to destroy it, was not likely long to re- main without some notable or fatal reverse. As- femblies of the People, already sufficiently tumul- tuary, being now confidered as the collective bo- dy of all the Italians, were become altogether im- pr-tdicable, or for the most part could be no more than parIti tumult-s whish, for particular purpo- ies, assumed thi title, in the streets of Rome, or the contiguous fields; insomuch that when we read of the authority of the Senate being set aside by an order of the People, we may venture to con- ceive all government iifpended at 'the'fuit of the party or fadtion who had the populace of the town at their call, rather .than any regular tranfadion of slate.
Licinius Crassus and .1. uliut, Caeifr were cho- fen Censors, in order to make up the new rolls of the People. This, it is likely, was found to be a difficult and tedious work. It became necessary to scrutinize the rolls. of every fcparate borough, in order to know who were entitled to be added to the lift of Roman citizens; and this difficulty was further increased in confequcnce of a law de- vised about this time by Papirius Carbo, in which it was 'enacted, that not only the natives and an- cient denizens of Italy, but all who fliould, for the future, obtain the fieedom of any Italian borough,
I 3 if
c H A P. if they had a residence in Italy, and lodged their , x'I claim to the Praetor sixty days, should, by that
ad, become citizens of Rome 1; so that the pre- rogative of the Roman People continued to be in the gift of every separate corporation, as well as in that of the State itself.
The number of the aliens admitted on the rolls, at this mutter, is not recorded; but it was pro- bably equal to that of the ancient citizens, and might have instantly formed a very powerful and dangerous faction in the State, if effectual measures had not been taken to diminish or guard againfit the effed of their influence. For this purpose, the new citizens were not mixed promiscuously with the mass of the People, but confined to eight particular Tribes 2; and of consequence, could in- fluence only eight votes in thirty-five 3; and the ancient citizens were still possessed of -a great ma- jority. But this artifice did not long escape the attention of those who were aggrieved by it, and became, in the sequel, subjed of farther dispute.
M.eantime, while the Romans were meditating, or adtually making, this important change in the state of their commonwealth, they found leisure for mat- ters of less moment, in which they endeavoured to
provide I Cicero pro Arclia Poeta. z Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii c. 20. 3 Hillorians mention this particular, as if eight new Tribes were added to the tormer thirty five; but the continual allusion of Roman vwriters, to the numnber thirty-five, will not allow us to fuppofc any augmentation.

provide for the peace of the city, and the admini- H A P. itration ofjuftice. x--
Plautius, one of the Tribunes, obtained a new Lex Plotia law for the feledtion of judges, by which it was enacted, That each Tribe ihould.annually set apart fifteen citizens, without any diftindion of rank; and that, from the whole so named, the judges in all trials that occurred within the year Ihould be taken . This law appeared to be equitable, as it gave, with great propriety, to all the different claf- fes of men in the commonwealth, an equal right to be named of the juries ; and to every party concern- ed, an equal .chance of-being tried by his peers.
The fame Tribune likewise obtained a law for Lex Ploti the preservation of the public peace, by which it d V'. was declared capital to be seen in any place of public retort, with a weapon, or inltrument of death; to occupy any place- of strength in the city; to offer violence to the house of any person, to disturb any private company ; to interrupt any meeting of the Senate, assembly of- thei People, or court of justice. To these clauses Catulus sub- joined another, in which he. comprehended per- sons surrounding the Senate with :an armed force, or offering violence to any 'magiitrate 2

C H A . HE social war, though far from being success-
- ful on the part of the Romans, concluded
with a triumphal procefilon; and the Senate, though actually obliged to yield the point for which they contended, thought proper, under pre- tence of advantages gained on some particular oc- cafions, to eret a trophy. They singled out Pom- peius Strabo for the pageant in this ceremony; either because he had reduced Afculum, where thc rebellion first broke out, or because a victory obtained by him had most immediately preceded the peace. But the mofi remarkable circumltance
in this procession was, its being, in shew, a tri- CHAP. umph of the old citizens over the new, but in rea- XV . lity a triumph of the latter. Ventidius Baffus, be- ing a prisoner in the war, and led as such in the present triumph, was now, though in the form of a captive, in saC introduced to share in the prerogatives of a Roman; he was, in the sequel, promoted to all the honours of the State; and, in the quality of a victorious general, came to lead a procession of the fame kind with that in which he himself had made his first entry at Rome as a captive '.
Sylla, by his conduct and his successes wherever he had borne a separate command in this war, gave proof of that superior genius by which he now began to be diftinguifled. By his magna- nimity on all occasions, by his great courage in danger, by his imperious exactions from the ene- my, and by his lavish profusion to his own troops, he obtained, in a very high degree, the confidence and attachment of soldiers ; and yet in this, it is probable, that he acted merely from temper, and not from design, or with any view to the confe- quence. With so careless and lb bold a hand did this man already hold the reins of military difci- pline, that Albinus, an officer of high rank, and next in command to himself, being killed by the fol- diers in a mutiny, he treated this outrage as a trifle, faying, when the matter was reported to him, That

cH A P. the troops would atone for it when they met with
xVI. the enemy v. With great merits recently display- L. Cor.6 ed, he repaired to the city, laid claim to the Con- s-ll.-, fulate, and cwas accordingly chosen, in conjuncdion Pomp. Ru- fu, Co.. with Qlintus Pompeius Rufus.
It was thought necessary Rill to keep, a proper force under arms in Italy, until the public tran- quillity fiould be fully established. The army, which had acted under Cneius Pompeius Strabo, Consul of the: preceding year,,was destined. for this service; and Quintus Rufus was. appointed to the command of it.
The war with Mithridates, king of Pontus, how- ever, was the principal objec of attention; and this province, together with the army then lying in Campania, fell to the lot of Sylla.
The monarchy of Pontus had sprung from the ruins of the Macedonian eltabliflments in Asia; and, upon their entire suppression, was become one.of the most considerable kingdoms of the East.
:Mithridates .had inherited from his ancestors a great extent of territory, reaching in length, ac- cording to the representation of his ambassador quo- ted by Appian, twenty thousand fiadia, above two thouland miles. He himself had joined to it the kingdom of Colchis, and other provinces on the coatts of the Euxine sea. His military eftablifll- ment amounted to three hundred thousand foot, and forty thousand horse, betides auxiliaries from Thrace, and from that part of Scythia which lies

on the Meotis and the Tanais, countries over CHAP.
xlv. which he had acquired an ascendant approaching . to Sovereignty. He had pretensions likewise on the kingdoms of Bithynia and Cappadocia, which he had hitherto relinquished from deference to the Ronmans; or of which he had postponed the effect until he ihould be prepared to cope with this for- midable power. All his pretensions, indeed, like those of other monarchies or states of any deno- mination, were likely to extend with his force, and to receive no .limitation but from the defet of his power. And such were his resources, and his personal character, that if he had encountered on the fide of Europe with an enemy less able than the'Romans were to withstand his progress, it is probable that in his hands the empire of Pon- tus might have vied.with that of the greatest con- querors recorded in history.
About the time that the social war broke out in Italy, Caiflus Longinus, Manius Acquilius, and C. Oppius were, in different charaters, Rationed in the province of Asia, and had taken under their proteCtion every power in the country that was likely to oppose the king of Pontus in his progress to empire.
Nicomedes, who had been recently restored to the crown of Bithynia, made hostile incursions under the encouragement of his Roman allies, even into the kingdom of Pontus itself. And the king, having made fi-uitlefs complaints on this uibject to the Roman governors in Asia; and thinking
that
c AP.-that the diftraded state of Italy furnished him ,I. %with a favourable opportunity to flight their re-
fentnment, he sent his son Ariarathes into Cappa- docia with a force to expel Ariobarzanes, though an ally of the Romans, and to possess that king- dom. He took the field himself, and sent power- iul armies, under his generals, against Nicomedes, and his Italian confederates, who, on their part, had assembled all the force of their province and of their allies, to the amount of an hundred and twenty thousand men, in different bodies, to defend their own frontier, or to annoy their enemy.
Mithridates fell separately upon the different par- ties which were thus forming against him; and hav- ing defeated Nicomedes, and afterwards Manius, obliged the Roman officers, with their ally, to re- tire; Cafflus to Apamea, Manius towards Rhodes. and Nicomedes, to Pergamus.' His fleet, likewise, confifing of three hundred gallies, opened the pas- sage ofthe Hellespont, took all the ihips which the-Romans had stationed in thoe. straits; and' he himself soon after in person traversed Phrygia and the:'Leffer Asia, to the sea of Cilicia and Greece. In all the cities of the Lesser Asia, where the people, as usual upon a change of maifers, now openly declared their detestation of the Roman dominion, he was received with open gates. He got pofleffion of the person of Oppius, by means of the inhabitants of Laodicea, where this general had taken refuge with a body of mercenaries. These were allowed to disband; but Oppius him-
self
self was conducted as a prisoner to the head-quar- c H A P. ters of Mithridates, and, in mockery of his itate i as a Roman governor, was made to pass through the cities in his way, with his fasces or ensigns of magistracy carried before, him.
Manius Acquilius likewise fell into the hands of the enemy, was treated with similar scorn; and with a barbarity which nothing but the most cri- minal abuse of the power he lately possessed could have deserved or provoked. Being carried round the cities of Asia mounted on an ass, he was ob- liged at every place to declare, that his own ava- rice had been the cause of the wI.-r; and he was at last put to death by the pouring Js melted gold into his throat.
While Mithridates thus dverwhelmed his ene- mies, and was endeavouring to complete his con- quest of Asia by the reduction of Rhodes, he or- dered his general Archelaus to penetrate by the way of Thrace and Macedonia into Greece.
Such was the alarming state of the war, when the Romans, having scarcely appeased the troubles in Italy, appointed L. Cornelius Sylla, with fix legions that lay in Campania, to embark for Greece, in order, if possible, to ftem a torrent which no ordinary bars were likely to withstand.
But before Sylla or his colleague could depart for their provinces, disorders arose in the city, which, however secure from the approach of so- reign enemies, brought armies to battle in the
ftrePts,
c H A P. streets, and covered the pavements of Rome with ,x__ the slain.
Publius Sulpicius, Tribune of the People, with a singular boldneis and profligacy, ventured to tamper with the dangerous humours which were but ill suppressed in the event of the late troubles; and, unrestrained by the fad experience of civil wars and domestic tumults, lighted the torch anew, and kindled the former animosity of the popular and Senatorian parties. The severe measures hitherto taken by the Senate and Magistrates against the au- thors of sedition had, in some instances, been effec- tual to snatch the republic out of the hands 'of law- less men, and to suspend for a while the ruin which threatened the commonwealth; but the examples to given, instead of deterring others from a repetition of the fame crimes, appear only to have admonished the fatious leaders to take more effectual precau- tions, and to make the necessary provision of armed force before they embarked in designs against the State. They accordingly improved and refined by degrees on the measures which they successively took againrt the Senate; and when the Tribune Sulpi. cius began to act, the arrangements he made were equal to a system of formal war. This Tribune, according to Plutarch, had three thousand gladia- tors in his pay, and in despite of the law of Plau- tius, had ever at his beck a numerous compaiy of retainers, armed with daggers and other offensive' weapons; these he called his Anti-fenate; and kept in readiness to be employed in attempts,
which
vwhich he was at no pains to disguise, againif the c I A P. authority of the Senate iteclf. He moved the. l . People to recal from exile all those who had with- drawn from the city on occasion of the former dif- orders, and to admit the new citizens, and enfran- chifed slaves, to be. enrolled promiifcuoufly in all the Tribes without regard to the late wife limita- tion of the Senate's decree, by which they were reiRrided to a few. By the change which he now proposed, the citizens of least consideration might come to have a majority, or irresistible sway in the public deliberations. The Tribunes would be- come mailers in every question, and fill up the rolls of the People in the manncr that most suited their interfit.
This presumptuous inan himfclf undertook to procure the freedom of the city for every person who applied to him, and boldly received premiums in the fireets for. this prollitution of the privileges and powers of his own constituents.
The more refpedable citizens, and even the magiflrates, in vain withstood these abuses. They were overpowered by force, and frequently driven from the place of. assembly. In this extremity they had recourfc to superstition, and by multiply- ing holidays, endeavoured to flop or to diiconcer:; their antagonists. But Sull:iciu>, with his party, laid violent hands on the Confuis, in order to force them to recal these appointments. Young Pom- pey, the son of the present Consul, and fon-in-law to.Sylla, was killed in the fray. Sylla himself,
though
c HA P. though withdrawn from the tumult, feeling that xv. , he was in the power of this desperate faction, and
being impatient to get into a situation in which he could more effecually counteract their fury, chose for the present to comply with their demands I.
In the midst of there violences, the city being under an actual usurpation or tyranny, Sylla re- paired to the army in Campania, with a resolution to pursue the object of his deitination in Asia, and to leave the Tribunitian Ntorms at Rome to spend their force. But soon after his departure, it ap- peared, that Marius was no firanger to the coun- cils of Sulpicius; and that he hoped, by means of this Tribune, to gratify an ambition which out- lived the vigour of his faculties and the strength of his body. His firit object was to mortify his rival Sylla, in revoking, by a decree of the People, the appointment of the Senate, and to supersede him in the command of the army againit Mithri- dates. A decree to this purpose was accordingly with ease obtained by Sulpicius, in one of those partial conventions, which took upon them to re- present the People of Italy in the streets of Rome; and Marius, now appointed general of the army in Campania, that was destined for the Asiatic war, sent the proper officers to notify his appointment to Sylla, and to receive from him, in behalf of hi. successor, the charge of the army, and the delivery of the flores. Sylla had the address to make the troops apprehend that this change was equally
prejudicial t Plutarch. in Marit), p. :5t. edit. L din. 4to
prejudicial to them as to himself; that Marius CHAP. had his favourite legions whom he would natu- l.V. rally employ; and that the fame ad of violence, by which he had supplanted the general, would bring other officers and other men, to reap the fruits of this lucrative service in Asia. This per- fuiafion, as well as the attachment which the army already bore to their general, produced its effec ',
The officers who were charged to make knowii the appointment of Marius, on declaring their commission, found that violence could take place in the camp as well as in the city. Their orders were received with scorn. A tumult arose among the soldiers; and citizens vested with a public character, formally commissioned to communicate an order of the Roman People, and in the exercise of their duty, were slain in the camp.
In return to this outrage some relations and friends of Sylla were murdered at Rome, and such retaliations were not soon likely to end on either fide 2. Fadtion is generally blind, and does not fee the use that may be made of its own violent precedents against itself. Although Sylla is said to have hesitated, yet he was not a person likely to Ihrink from the contest, in which his private enemies, and those of the State, had engaged him. Stung with rage, and probably thinking that force would be justified in snatching the republic out of such violent hands, he proposed to the army that

CHAP. they should march to Rome. The proposal wa3
_IV. received with joy; and the army, without any of
the scruples, or any degree of that hesitation which in adopting this measure is ascribed to their com- mander, followed where he thought proper to lead them.
On this new and dangerous appearance of things, not only Marius and Sulpicius, with the persons most obnoxious on account of the insults offered to Sylla and to other refpedable citizens, were seized with coniternation; but even the Senate and the Nobles, feeing questions of state likely to be decided by military force, were justly alarmed.
A faction, it is true, had affmned the authority of the Roman People, to violate the laws, and to overawe the State; but armies, it was thought, are dangerous tools in the quarrels of party; and no good intention on the part of their leaders, no magnanimity or moderation in the execution of their plans, can compensate the ruinous tendency of a precedent which brings force to be employed as an ordinary resource in political contests. Even the present state of the republic did not appear so desperate as to justify such a measure.
The Senate accordingly sent a deputation to Sylla with entreaties, and with commands, that he would not advance to the city. This deputation was received by him within a few miles of the gates. He heard the remonstrance that was made to him with patience, and seemed to be moved: gave orders, in the hearing of the deputies, that
the
the army should halt; sent the proper officers to c TI A P. mark out a camp, and suffered the commiflioners to return to their employers, full of the persuasion that he was to comply with their request. But in this he only meant to deceive his antagoniits; and having lulled them into a state of security, he sent a detachment close on the heels of the deputies of the Senate, with orders to seize the nearest gate, while he himself, with the whole army, speedily followed to support them.
The gate was accordingly seized. The People, in tumult, endeavoured to recover it; Marius fe- cured the Capitol, summoned every person, whe- ther freeman or slave, to repair to his fiandard and multitudes assembled, as in a military station, to form on the parade. Sylla, in the mean time, at the head of his army, ruffed through the gate, of which his vanguard, though pressed by multi- tudes by whom they were attacked, were fill in polTeflion. He was greatly annoyed from the bat- tlements and windows as he pafled, and might have been repulsed by the more numerous army of Roman citizens in the fireets, if he had not coin- manded the city to be set on fire, in order to pro- fit by the confufiori into which the People were likely to be thrown in avoiding or in extinguifl-- ing the flames. By this expedient he drove MiL- rius from all the fiations he had occupied, and obliged his adherents to disperse.
While the army was distributed in diflerent quarters of a city, deformed with recent marls of
K 2 bloodfrecd
CHAP. bloodlhed and fire, their general assembled the .xv. 0 Senate, and called on them to confider the present
state of affairs. Among the measures he suggested on this occasion, was a law by which Marius, with his son, and twelve of his faction, who had secret- ed themselves, were declared enemies of their country. This sentence was accompanied with a public injundion to seize or to kill them wherever they could be found. The reasons upon which this aft of attainder was granted, were, that they had violated the laws, and seduced the flares to desert from their masters, and to take arms against the republic r.
While the officers of justice were employed in execution of this decree, and many others were busy in search of their private enemies, thus laid at their mercy, the Tribune Sulpicius, having lted to the marimcs on the coast near Laurentum, waS dragged from thence and slain. His head, fevered from the body, as that of a traitor, who had furs pailed every leader of fation in the outrages done lo the laws and the government of his country, was exposed on one of the rostra; an example as- terwards frequently imitated, and which, though it could not enhance the evil of the times, became an additional expression of the animosity and ran- cour of parties against each other t.

Marius, upon his expulsion from Rome, retired c HA v. to his own villa at Salonium; and being unpro- vided for a longer flight, sent his son to the farm of one Mutius, a friend in the neighbourhood, to procure what might be necessary for a voyage by Lea. The young man was discovered at this place, and narrowly escaped in a waggon loaded with straw, which, the better to deceive his pursuers, he had ordered to take the road to Rome. The fa- ther fled to Ostia, and there embarked on board a vessel which was provided for him by Numerius, who had been one of his partizans in the pre- ceding disorders. Having put to tea, he was for- ced by stress of weather to Circeii, there landed in want of every neceldary, and made himself known to some herdfmnen, of whom he implored relief. Being informed of the parties that were abroad in pursuit of him, he concealed himself for the night in a neighbouring wood. Afterwards, continuing his flight by the coast, ,and on his way to the town of Mirturnae, he was alarmed at the fight of some horsemen who seemed to be in search; made for the ihore, and, with much difficulty, got on board of a boat which was passing. The persons with whom he thus took refuge resifted the threats and importunities of the pursuers to have him deliver- ed up to them, or thrown into the sea; but hav- ing rowed him to a supposed place of safety at the mouth of the L ,is, they put him on fliore, and left him to his fate. Here he firil took refuge in a cottage, afterwards under a hollow bank of the
K 3 river,
c 1- A p. river, and, last of all, on hearing the tread of the XiV . I . horfcmen, who fiill pursued him, he plunged him-
self to the chin in a marsh; but, though conceal- ed by the reeds and the depth of the water, he was discovered and dragged from thence all cover- ed with mud. He was carried to Minturnar, and doomed by the magiitrates of the place to susser, in execution of the sentence which had been de- nounced against himfPlf and his partizans at Rome. He swas, however, by some connivance, allowed to cfcape from hence, again put to sea, and, at the illand JEnaria, joined obme afrociates of his flight. Being afterwards obliged to land in Sicily for a supply of water, and being known, he narrowly e'caped with the loss of some of the crew that na- vigated his veiTel. From thence he arrived on the coait of Africa; but, being forbid the province by the Pretor Sextilius, continued to shift his abode among the islands or places of retirement on the coast '.
This adventurer was in his seventieth year when, by means of popular tumults, he made this attempt to overturn the Roman republic, and when he firove to obtain the command of an army in the buliet and mnor arduous service which the Roman empire had then to offer.

description. A Gaulish or German soldier, who c HA P. was employed at Minturne to put him to death, XI it is said, overawed by his afpecd, recoiled from the talk ; and the people of the place, as if moved by this miracle of the terrified soldier, concurred in aiding his escape'. The presence of such an exile on the ground where Carthage had flood, was supposed to increase the majesty and the me, lancholy of the scene. " Go," he said to the Lidor who brought him the orders of the Praetor to de- part, " tell him that you have seen Marius fitting ' on the ruins of Carthage 2."
The Senate, thus reflored to its authority, and, by the suppression of the late sedition, masters of the city, took the proper measures to prevent, for the future, such violations of order from being in- troduced under pretence of popular government. They resolved that no question of legislation flould be agitated in the alfembly of the Tribes 3 ; and Sylla, before he left the city, thought proper to dispatch the election of consuls for the following year, but did not employ the power, which he now poflefled, to make the choice fall on persons who were both of the senatorian party. Together with Octavius, who had the authority of the Se- nate at heart, he suffered Cinna, though of the opposite fation, to be vested with the powers of Consul, and only exadced a promiie from him not to disturb the public tranquillity; nor, in his ab-
K 4 fence, Velleius Pater, lib. ii. c. 19, P!'-arcl in Mario. 3 Appian, de Bell. Civil, lib. i.
c H A '. fence, to attempt any thing derogatory of his own
XIV.
honour'.
Having in this manner retlored the city to an appearance of peace, Sylla let out with his army for its deitination in Greece. Qiintus Rufus, the other Consul of the preceding year, at the fame time repaired to his province in the country of the Marfi, where, as has been mentioned, he was to succeed Cn. Strabo in the command of some legi- ons; but being less agreeable to these troops than his predecessor had been, the soldiers mutinied upon his arrival, and put him to death. Cn. Strabo, though iufpec-ed of having connived with them in this horrid tranfadion, was permitted to profit by it in keeping his station. So quick was the succession of crimes which distressed the republic, that one disorder escaped with impunity, under the more atrocious effects of another which followed. U. c 66. 6 When Sylla was about to depart from the city, L. Corn. Cinna. Cn. Virgilius, one of the Tribunes, moved an impeach- Coa: menrt against him for the illegal steps he had late-
ly taken. But the itate of the war with Mithri- dates was urgent, and Sylla took the benefit of the law of Memmius, by which persons named to com- mand had a privilege when going on service to decline antivering any charge which should be brought againit them, to impede their departure.
The king of Pontus, notwithstanding he had been disappo;inted in his attempt upon Rlodes, wias become mailer of the Lcfier Asia, had fixed
his
his residence at Pergamus, and employed his of- CHAP.
XIV. ficers, with numerous fleets and armies, to conti- . nue his operations in different quarters, making rapid acquisitions at once on the fide of the Scy- thian and Thracian Bosphorus in Macedonia and in Greece. His general, Archelaus, had reduced moll of the Greek islands, and was haflening to make himself master of the continent also. De- los had revolted, and had thrown off the yoke of Athens, at the time that it fell into the hands of this general. Thle king proposed to make use of it as a decoy to bring the Athenians themselves under his power. For this purpose, pretending veneration for the god to whom this island was sacred, he expressed a desire to restore it, with the treasure he had seized there, to its former condi- tion; and sent Ariftion, a native of Athens, but now an officer in his own service, with an escort of two thousand men, to deliver this treasure into the hands of the Athenians. Ariffion being, un- der this pretence, received into the Pyreaus, took pofleffion of the place, and continued to hold it, wvith the city of Athens itself, for Mithridates, who, by means of the reinforcements sent into At- tica, soon after enabled him to overrun Beotia, Achaia, and Laconia.
To these alarming encroachments on the Ro- man territory, and to the personal injuries done to fich of their generals as had fallen into his hands, Mithridates had joined a barbarous outrage, which otufcd, in the highest degree, the resentment of
the
C H A P. the Roman People. He had sent orders to all his
XIV. IV_ commanders in every town and lation in Asia, on
a day fixed, to begin a massacre of the Roman ci- tizens that were any where fettled in that country, and to publish a reward for the saves of any Ro- man who should succeed in destroying their ma- ller. This order was executed with marks of in- fult, in which the vile instruments of cruelty, for the most part, are apt to exceed their inftrudions. It is particularly mentioned, that at Ephesus, Per- gamus, and other cities of Aria, entire families, without diftindion of sex or age, infants with their parents, taking refuge in the temples, and embra- cing the altars, were dragged from thence and murdered. But the number of persons who perifil- ed in this maiTacre, if ever known, is no where mentioned '.
The resentment which was natural on this oc- cafion, together with the real danger that threat- ened the empire, fully justified the contempt with which Sylla treated the impeachment of Virgilius, and the celerity with which he left the city of Rome. Having transported to Dyrachium an army of fix legions, he took the route of Theifaly and JEtolia; and having raised in these countries con. tributions for the pay and fibfiRlence of his army he received the submission of the Beotians, who had lately been obliged to declare for Mithridates, and advanced to Athens, where Ariftion in the city, and Archelaus in the Pyrxeus, were prepared
to x Aptiar. de Eell. Mithrl'. p. 585, 586.
to make a vigorous resistance. Mithridates, who c H A P. was mailer of the sea, colleced together all the X-V. troops which he had diitributed in the islands, and ordered a great reinforcement from Asia to form an army on the fide of Beotia for the relief of Athens.
Sylla, to prevent the enemy, hastened the siege of this place. He firit made an attempt to force his way into the Pyreus by scaling the walls; but being repulsed, had recourse to the ordinary means of attack. He ereEed towers, and railing them to the height of the battlements, got upon the fame level with the besieged, and plied his mirfiles from thence. He fliook the walls with battering engines, or undermined them with galleries, and made places of arms for his men near to where he expected to open a breach. But the defence of the place was vigorous .and obstinate, and so well conducted, that he was obliged, after many fruit- less efforts, to turn the siege into a blockade, or to await the effecds of famine, by which the city began already to be pressed, and by which it was in a little time brought to the lair extremity. Those who were confined in the place, had con- fumed all the herbage, and killed all the animals that were to be found within the circuit of the walls; they were reduced to feed on the imple- ments of leather, or other materials that could be turned into fuflenance, and came at last to prey upon the carcases of the dead. The garrison was greatly diminified in numbers and of those who
remained,
CHAP remained, the greater part was dispirited and
.- weak: but Ariftion, on account of the treache-
rous mranner in which he had seized the place, ex- pecting 'for himself no 'quarter from the Roman general, fill withstood the desire of his troops to capitulate; when Sylla, knowing the weak Rate to which the besieged were reduced, made a vi- gorous effort, flormed and forced the walls with great slaughter. Ariftion, who had retired into the Acropolis, was soon afterwards taken and slain.
Archelaus, likewise greatly difireffed in ti.e Py- raeus, found means to escape by water, and leaving the post he abandoned to be occupied by Sylla. who razed its fortifications to the ground he haften- ed to join the army that was forming by order of his maRter on the fide of Thessaly.
The army of Mithridates advanced into Beotia. Every part of it was sumptuously provided with all that was necessary for subsistence or parade. There was a numerous cavalry richly caparisoned; an infantry of every description, variously armed, some to use misfile weapons, others to engage in clotl fight; a large train of armed chariots, which, be- ing winged with scythes, threatened to sweep the plains. The whole army amounted to about an hundred .and twenty thousand men. But their master, with all his ability, it appears, in the man- ner of barbarous nations, relied on the numbers of his hrft, to th neglec of its order, or.the proper conduc of its strength. Sylla was to oppose this
multitude,
multitude, with no more than thirty thousand c HA P.
XIV, men. mV,
On this inferior enemy, Archelaus continually pressed with all his forces, and endeavoured to bring on a general acion, which Sylla cautiously avoided; waiting for an opportunity that might deprive the enemy of the advantage he had in the superiority of his numbers. The armies being both in Beotia, Archelaus inadvertently took post near Cheronea, on the ascent of a steep hill that was formed into natural terraces by ledges of rocks, and which terminated at last in a peak or narrow summit. On the face of this hill he had crowded his infantry, his cavalry, and his chariots, and truited that, although the ground was unfavour- able to the operations of such an army, it was fill inaccessible, and they could not be attacked.
While the Asiatic general, therefore, believed himself secure in this position, the Roman conti- nued to observe him from the post he had fortified at a little distance; and was told by some natives of the country, that the hill which Archelaus had occupied might be ascended in his rear, and that a body of men might be conduced safely and un- observed to the summit. Upon this information Sylla formed his plan to engage the enemy, sent a powerful detachment with proper guides to seize on the heights above their encampment, while he himself advanced with his main body in front of their station, and by this means diverted their at- tention fiom what was pafling on the opposite
qua rter,
C I A P. quarter, while he hiimfelf was prepared to profit by Xlv. ,- L, any confusion which might ,be occasioned by an
alarm from thence.
The unexpected appearance of an enemy on the rear, produced the alarm that was intended, in the Asiatic camp. The impetuous descent they were ordered to make from the hill, drove all in confusion before them. The rear fell down on the front. A great uproar and tumult arose in every part. In this critical moment, Sylla, with the main body, began his attack in fiont, and soon broke into the midst of enemies, who were altogether un- prepared to receive him: or who being crowded in a narrow space, and mixed with little diftindion of separate bodies, of officers or men; and, under the disadvantage of their ground, could neither refifl nor retire. In the centre, numbers were trod un- der foot by those who pressed upon them from every fide, and perithed by violence or suffocation; or, while they endeavoured to open a way to es- cape, employed their swords against one another. Of an hundred and twenty thousand men, scarce- ly ten thousand could be assembled at Chalcis in Eubea, the place to which Archelaus directed his flight. Of the Romans, at the end of the action, only fifteen men w ere miiltng, and of theie, two returned on the dollow ing day r.
Archelau3, even after this rout of his army, be- ng till Inafter at .ea, drew supplics from A.ia and irom thle neighbouring ifilnds; and, being secure in lis retre.a in lUG -, iadlc' :reqolclent Cicenllts on the

neighbouring coasts. While Sylla cndeavoured to c H A P. cover the lands of Beotia and Attica from these Xl. incursions, Mithridates made great eflbrts to re- place his army in that country; and in a little time had transported thither eighty thousand frefli troops under Dorilaus, to whom Archelaus joined himself with those he had saved from the late dif- after. The new army of Mithridates, coniifting chiefly of cavalry, was greatly favoured by the na- ture of the ground in Beotia, which was flat and abounding in forage. Sylla, though inclined to keep the heights on which he was least exposed to the enemy's cavalry, was, in order to cover the country from which he drew his subsistence, ob- liged to descend to the plains in the neighbour- hood of Orchomenos. There he took post among the marfies, and endeavoured to fortify himself with ditches against the enemy's horse. While his works were yet unfinifled, being attacked by the Asiatic cavalry, not only the labourers, but the troops that were placed under arms to cover the workmen, were seized with a panic, and fled. Sylla, having for tome time in vain endeavoured to rally them, laid hold of an ensign, and rufled in de- fpair on the enemy. " To me," he said, " it is glo- l rious to fall in this place: but for you, if you are asked where you deferred your leader, you may "fay at Orchomlenos." Numbers who heard this reproach, returned to the charge with their gene- ral; and wherevcr they presented themfcives, ifop- ped the career of the enemy, and pitt them to

ing his horse, took the full advantage of the change of his fortune, pursued the enemy to their camp, and forced them to abandon it with great flaugh- ter.
After the loss of this second army, Mithridates appears to have despaired of his affairs in Greece: he suffered Sylla to enter into quiet possession of his winter quarters in Thefaly, and authorised Archelaus to treat of peace.
Both parties were equally inclined to a confe- rence; the king of Pontus urged by his lofies, and the Roman Proconsul by the state of affairs in Italy. There, though commanding in Greece by authori- ty from the Roman Senate, Sylla had been degra- ded, and declared a public enemy, by a formal fen- tence or resolution of the People at Rome. An officer had been sent from Italy to supersede him; and a Roman army, independent of his orders, wais actually employed in the province. Mithri- dates too, while he had futlained such losses in Greece, was pressed by the other army in Asia, under the command of Fimbria, who, with inten- tions cquallv hostile to Sylla as to Mithridates, ad- vanced with a rapid pace, reduced several towns on the coafl, and had lately made himself malter of Pergamus, where the king himself had narrow- ly escaped falling into his hands. In these cir- cumfances, a treaty was equally seasonable to both.
Sylla
Svlla had been absent from Rome about two CHAP. years, during which time, having no supplies from thence, he had supported the war by the contribu- tions which he had raised in Greece, _Etolia, and Thessaly, and with the money he had coined from the plate and treasure of the Grecian temples'. The republic, in the mean time, had been in the possession of his personal enemies, and the autho- rity of the Senate was, in a great measure, sup- pressed. For soon after his departure from Rome, his antagonist Cinna, notwithstanding the engage- ments he had come under, revived the projet of keeping the more refpedable citizens in fubjedion, under pretence of regulations enacted by the col- lective body of the People.
The designation of a party now in power was the fame with that which had distinguished the followers of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus; but the object was changed, and that which was term- ed the popular faction was itself differently com- posed. Formerly this facion consisted of the po- pulace of Rome and of the poorer citizens, oppo- fed to the noble and the rich. The objects for which they at that time contended, were the di- itribution of corn, new settlements, or the division of lands. At present the parties consisted of the inhabitants of the country towns lately admitted, or still claiming to be admitted,.on the rolls of the People of one fide, and of the Senate and ancient citizens on the other. The objec to which the former aspired, was a full and equal participation
VOL. II. L in rlutai Ch. in Slla et Luculli,
C H AP. in all the powers that belonged to the Roman
xIv .People. They were far from being satisfied with
the manner of their enrolment into a few particu- lar Tribes, and laid claim to be admitted without diftincion among the ancient citizens, and like them to have consideration and power proportioned to their numbers. In this they were supported by Cinna, who made a motion in their favour in the assembly of the People, and at the fame time propo- fed to recal Marius and the other exiles of that par- ty from their banishment. The Consul Ocdavius, with the majority of the Senate and ancient citi- zens, opposed their designs; but Cinna was likely to have a powerful support in the friends of the exiles, and in the new citizens, who flocked from every town in the country. On the day appoint- ed for the ditcuffion of this question, his parti- zans, in great numbers, took pofleflion of the place of assembly, and were observed to be armed with daggers or flort swords. Odavius was attended at his own house by a numerous company of the ancient citizens, who were armed in the fame man- ner, and waited to take such measures as the ne- ceffity of the cafe might require. Being told that the Tribunes who had forbidden the queflion were violently attacked, and likely to be driven from the place. These adherents of the Senate came forth in- to the streets, and drove their antagonists, with some bloodised, through the gates of the city. Cinna endeavouring to make head againit his colleague, invited the slaves, under a promise of liberty,.
to
to his standard. But finding it impossible within c I :, p. a city, that was occupied by his opponents, to withfiand their force, he withdrew to the country towns, and solicited supplies irom thence. .He pafled through Tibur and Praeefte to Nola, and openly implored the inhabitants to aid him agairnit their common enemies. On this occasion he was attended by Sertorius, and by iomnc other Senators who had embarked in the fame ruinous factiono Their solicitations at any other tin-: might per- haps have been fruitless; but now, to the misfor- tune of the republic, a number of armies were frill kept on foot in Italy, to finlih the remains of the social war. Cn. Strabo commanded one army in Umbria, Metellus another on the confines of Lucania and Samnium, and Appius Claudius a third in Campania. These armies consisted chiefly of indigent citizens, become soldiers of fortune, very much at the ditpofal of the leaders, in whose name they had been levied, to whom, as usual, they had sworn the military oath, and on whom they depended for the settlements and rewards which they -were taught to expect at the end of their services. Such men were inclined to take part in the cause of any faction that was likely, by the expulsion and forfeiture of any one class of the citizens, to make way for preferments and fortunes to those who were employed to expel them.
Cinna distrusted Pompey and Metellus ; but hop- ing for. a better reception from Appius Claudius, he repaired to the camp of this general, and had the
L 2 address
c H A P. address to gain the troops who were under his con- _?" mand.
5aTius Mean time the Senate, without entering into any and Meru- la- particular discussion of the guilt which Cinna had
incurred in the late tumult at Rome, found that, by having deserted his fiation, he had acually divest- ed himself of his office as Consul, and they ob- tained the election of L. Cornelius Merula, to sup- ply the vacancy which his desertion had occasioned.
Marius, being informed that one of the armies in Italy, with a Roman Conlful at its head, was pre- pared to filpport him, made hate from his exile in Africa: he landed in Tuscany, was joined by num- bers, and on his approach to Rotie had an offer of being velted with the ensigns of Proconsul. But in- tending to move commiseration or pity, he declined every privilege of a Roman citizen, until the fen- tence of attainder or banishment, which had been pronounced againit him, should be formally rever- ied. He accordingly presented himfelfto the People as he pafled, in the manner pradtifed by suppliants, with a mean habit, and in the ghastly figure, to which he was reduced by the distress of his exile; but with a countenance, fays his historian, which, being naturally stern, now rather moved terror than pity . He implored the protection of the country-towns, in whose cause he pretended to have fiflercd, and whose interests were now embarked on the lamne bottom with his own. He had many ,artizans among those who had conmpofed the le-
gion1 P'rn:t;ih.';;_ ~xio.
gions which formerly served under his own orders c H A P. Had reputation and authority, and soon assembled -J.,v a considerable force, with which, in concert with Cinna, Sertorius and Carbo, he advanced towards Rome.
These adventurers invested the city in three fe- parate divisions. Cinna and Carbo lay before it: On the Appian way, Sertorius took post on the ri- ver above, and Marius below it. The last, to pre- vent supplies from the sea, made himself master of the port of Ostia: Sertorius had sent a detach- ment to Arimiumn, to prevent any relief from the fide of Gaul.
In this extremity the Senate applied to Metel- lus, requesting that he would make any possible accommodation with such of the Italian allies as were still under arms, and haften to the relief of the city. The delays which he made in the exe- cution of there orders enabled Cinna and Marius to prevent him in gaining the allies, who at this time had it in their option to accept the privileges they claimed from either party; and, having chosen to join themselves with the popular fation, they threw their weight into that scale.
Metellus, however, advanced into Latiumn; and, being joined by the Consul Oatavius, took polt on the Alban Hill. From thence they found that the troops, being inclined to favour their enemies, de- fertcd apace. The commander himself being left with a few attendants, despaired of the cause, and
', 3 ithdrew
CHAP. wvithdrew into Africa. Oaavius found means to
. enter the city, and resumed his station
The army lately commanded by l'ompeius Stra- bo was now deprived of its general; he having been killed by lightning in his camp. And the Senate was not incliniL to repose any confidence in the men he h':i commanded. He himself had s ome time hesitated between the parties; and the troops, at his death, were till supposed undecided in t'heir choice. With so uncertain a profped of support, the Senate thinking it more safe to capi- tulate with Cinna and Marius, than to remain ex- posed to the horrors of a storm; offered to rein- ifate Cinna in the office of Consul, and to restore Marius, with the other exiles, to their condition of Roman citizens; only stipulating that they would spare the blood of their opponents, or pro- ceed in their complaints against them according to the laws of the commonwealth.
WVhile this treaty was in dependence, Marius, affecting the modesty of a person whom the law, according to his late sentence of banishment, had disqualified to take any part in the state, ob- served a fullen and obfiinate silence. Even when the terms were fettled, and the gates were laid open to himself and his followers, he refused to enter until the attainder under which he lay should be taken off, and until he were replaced in his condition as a citizen of Rome. The Peo- ple were accordingly aflembled to repeal their for- mer decree. But Marius, in the charader of a
pradi fed
pradtifed soldier, proposing to take his enemies by c H A P. surprise, did not wait for the completion of the XIV. ceremony he himself had exated. While the bal- lots were collecting, he entered the city with a band of armed men, whom he instantly employed in taking vengeance on those who had concurred in the late measures against him. Although the gates, by his orders, were secured, many of the Senators found means to withdraw. The house of Sylla was demolished, such as were reputed his friends were slain, his wife and his children narrowly escaped. Among the signals by which Marius di- reaed the execution of particular persons, it was understood that if he did not return a salute which was offered him, this was to be confidered as a warrant for immediate death. In compliance with these inftrudions, some citizens of note were laid dead at his feet. And as the meanest retainers of his party had their resentments as well as himself, and took this opportunity to indulge their passions, the city resembled a place that was taken by storm, and every quarter resounded with the cries of rage or of terror; a horrid scene, which continued without intermission during five days and five nights. The Consul Odavius was murdered in his robes of office, and in pretence of his litors; two Senators of the name of Coefar, Caius and Lu- cius; two of the name of Crafius, the father and the son, attempting to escape, but likely to be taken, fell by their own hands; Attilius Serranus, Publi- us Lentulus, C. Numitorius, and M. Babius, be-
L 4 ing
c H A P. ing murdered by persons who bore them a parti- I- -v- , cular hatred, the bodies were fastened on a hook,
and dragged by a rope through the fireets; Marcus Antonius, one of the first Roman Senators, who had betaken himself entirely or chiefly to the prac- tice of a Pleader at the bar and in the Senate, from which he is known by the name of the Orator, being discovered in a place of concealment, was killed by aflaffins sent for the purpose. The heads of the others were exposed on the rostra; that of Antonius was placed on the table of Marius, to whom the fight, from peculiar motives of envy or resentment, was singularly gratifying. Catulus, once the colleague of Marius himself in the Con- fulate, and partner in his last and most deci- live victory over the Cimbri, without question one of the most refpeaable Senators of the age, being included in the warrant for general exe- cution, had numbers to solicit for his life; but Marius, exasperated the more by this appearance of popular regard in his favour, made a short an- fwer, He must die. And this vicim, choofing to avoid by a voluntary death the insults likely to be offered to his person, having shut himself up il a close chamber, with a braier of burning char- .coal, perifled by futffocation. Merula, the Flamen Dialis, or Priest of Jupiter, whose name, without his own knowledge, had been inscribed Consul upon the degradation of Cinna, now likewise, will- ing to maintain to the last the dignity of his tRation, openzd his own arteries at the shrine of his god, sprinkling the idelc with his blood. As he
felt
felt the approach of death, he tore from his head c H A P.
XIY. the apex or crest of the order, which he bore, and, xv with which, by the maxims of his religion, he could not part while in life, but with which on his head it would have been impious, and omi- nous of evil, to have died. In observing this ceremony, he called upon those who were present to witness the exaanefs with which he performed his duty.
The horrors of this masTacre are to be imputed chiefly, if not entirely, to the fury of Marius, acing from the original asperity of his own mind, stung with animosity to every diftintion of birth, education, or manners, which marked the superior order of citizens, and now wrought up by recent lifappointments of ambition, and by his sufferings in exile, into a detestation and rancour, which no- thing short of such a scene could alsuage. In most other places, indeed, instruments would have been wanting for the execution of such a work: But at Rome were found in sufficient numbers, fu- gitive slaves, eager to avenge their own susser- ings, in the blood of their masters; parties in private quarrels; thieves, expecting plunder, in the murder of the wealthy; a populace, such as every where is capable of the wildest difor- der, when assembled in occasional tumults; but here peculiarly nursed in scenes of license, with pretensions to political importance, and even to so- vereignty, detesting the superior orders of the fate, by whom they felt themselves restrained; indigent, but looking for relief, not to their own incluftry or
lhonfit
C H A P. honest arts, but to gratuities, obtained by corruption
. or public profusion. In their very entertainments or sports, whether fights of gladiators, or baiting of wild beasts, trained to a ruthless insensibility and indifference to blood: Such men, having the example and authority of a leader, whom they had long confidered as the champion of their cause, and having the several objects of their fury at mercy, burit out into a scene of wild devastation, attend- ed with murders, rapes, and every species of out- rage, which could arise from the suspension of Go- vernment in a State, where the disorderly were found in such numbers, and the most powerful re- ftraints were neceflary.
Cinna himself, though equally bent with his as- fociate on measures to recover his power, and to restore his party, but having fewer resent- ments to gratify, was shocked with these enormi- ties, and interposed his authority to restrain them. The mandates of office being insufficient for this purpose, he had recourse to military force, and, driving all who were found in the perpetration of such crimes into places inclosed, or into the recess of squares or narrow streets, had them in great num- bers, without inquiry or diftindion, put to the sword.
Some degree of respite or calm being obtained by these means, it was proposed to resume the ap- peareance of regular Government, as far as the times could allow. The Consulate of Cinna was accordingly restored; and Marius, though without any form of eleion, airociated in the office. In such
a
a season of terror, there could not be any risk to c H A P. the party in recurring to the ordinary suffrage of the ^_ People; but an elecion was deemed unnecessary, and the ensigns of office were assumed without it.
Marius, though now preceded in form by the Lidors, could not return to the habits of a legal magistrate. The objects of his resentment were fill sacrificed to his fury, without any trial, and under his own infpedion. But, in the midst of cries which were occasioned by these executions, the name of Sylla, and the fame of his victories in Greece, gave continual presage of a retribution, no way likely to fall short of the provocation which was now given in the subversion of public order at Rome. And although the principal author ot these wrongs was not destined to abide the future consequences in his own pexfon, the immediate effect to him was sufficiently awful. Even the obdu- rate foul of Marius, unable to endure such a load of guilt and remorse, passed from the agitation of fury to that of terror and nocturnal fears, which gave evident signs or indications of a disordered mind. Some one, he imagined, continually found- ed in his ears the words of a poet, Horrid is the dying lion's den; and these words being applied to himself, seemed to announce his approaching dissolution. He took to the use of wine in excess, contracted a pleurisy, and died on the seventh day of his illness, in the seventeenth day of his last or seventh consulate, and in the seventieth year of his age; leaving the tools he had employed in
subverting
C H A, Pubverting the government of his country to pay
Z.t the forfeit of his crimes.
Livy, it appears' from the remaining epito- me of this part of his work, had made it a question, whether this celebrated personage had been most useful to his country as a soldier, or pernicious as a citizen. It has happened unfortunately for his fame, that he closed the scene of life with exam- ples of the latter kind. In what degree he retain- ed his genius or abilities cannot be known. HIis insatiable thirit of power, like. avarice in the cafe of the superannuated miser, seemed to grow with age. His hatred of the Nobles, contracted in the obscurity of his early life, remained with him as- ter he himself had laid the amplest foundations of Nobility in his own family. And he died in an at- tempt to extinguish all juit or regular government, in the blood of those who were most eminently qualified or disposed to sustain it.
Upon the death of Marius, the government re- mained in the hands of Cinna. While many of the Senators, and other citizens, obnoxious to the pre- vailing party, had taken refuge with Sylla: this general himself was declared a public enemy; his effecs were seized; his children, with their mo- ther, having narrowly escaped the pursuit of his enemies, were fled to the father in Greece. In these circumstances he made not any change in his conduct of the war, nor made any concessions to

the enenty against whom he was employed. Hec H A P.
xlv. talked familiarly every day of his intention to sup-. v. press the disorders at Rome, and to avenge the blood of his friends, but not till he had forced Mi- thridates to make reparation for the wrongs he had done to the Romans and to their allies in Asia.
Alarmed by the report of such threats, Cinna took measures to strengthen his own party; affu- med, upon the death of Marius, Valerius Flaccus as his colleague in the office of Consul; and, ha- ving afligned him the command in Asia, with two additional legions, trussed, that with this force he might obtain poflefflon of the Province, and fur- nifh to Sylla sufficient occupation beyond the li- mits of Italy.
But Flaccus, upon his arrival in Theflaly, was desertcd by part of the army he was destined to employ; and passing through Macedonia in his route to Alia with the remainder, a dispute arose between himself and his lieutenant Fimbria, which ended in the murder of the Consul, and in the succession of Fimbria to the command. So little deference or refpecd did soldiers of fortune pay, in the disorder of those unhappy times, even to the heads of a party they profefled to serve.
Fimbria, with the troops he had seduced to his itandard, after he had aTiaffinated their general, made a rapid progress in Alia, and hastened, as ,has been observcd, the resolution to which Mithri- dates was come, of applying for peace. To this llately but crafty prince, urged by the rieceffity of !his own affairs, the conjtunu!lt e appeared to be
favourable,
CHAP. favourable, when so much diffradion took place .-^. in the councils of Rome. He had experienced
the abilities of Sylla; he knew his eager desire to be gone for Italy, and to be revenged of his ene- mies ; and he expected to gain him by proffering assistance in the war he was about to wage witli the opposite party at Rome.
Upon a message from Archelaus, Sylla readily agreed to an interview in the island of Delos; and here being told, in the name of Mithridates, that he should have money, troops, and flhipping to make a descent upon Italy, provided he would en- ter into a confederacy with the king of Pontus, or join him in a war with the Romans, by whom he himself was now proscribed, Sylla, in his turn, pro- posed to Archelaus to desert Mithridates, to deliver up the fleet and army which was under his com- mand, and to rely for protedtion and reward on the faith of the Romans. They will speedily feat you, he said, on the throne of Pontus. Archelaus having rejected this proposal with horror, " And you," lhys Sylla, " the slave, or (if you prefer that title) "the friend of a barbarous tyrant, will not betray " your trust, and yet, to me, have the prefump-
tion to propose an ac of perfidy. The fields " of Chaeronea and Orchomenos should have made "you better acquainted with the character of a ; Roman."
Upon this reply Archelaus saw the necessity of purchasing the treaty he was 'inftrudted to obtain, srA1 .ccordingly made the following conceflions:
That
That the fleet of Pontus, consisting of seventy C H A P.
XIV. Galleys, ihould be delivered up to the Romans. --
That the garrisons should be withdrawn from all places which had been seized in the course of this war.
That the Roman province in Asia, together with Paphlagonia, Bithynia, and Cappadocia should be evacuated, and the frontier of Pontus, for the fu- ture, be the boundary of Mithridates's territory.
That the Romans should receive two thousand talents ', to reimburse their expence in the war.
That prisoners ihould be restored, and all de- ferters delivered up.
While these articles were sent to Mithridates for his ratification, Sylla in no degree relaxed the measures he had taken to secure and to facilitate the passage of his army into Asia. He sent Lucul- lus 2 round every fiation on the coast to procure an assemblage of shipping; and he himself, after ha- ving made some incursions into Thrace, to gratify his army with the spoil of nations who had often plundered the Roman province, continued his route to the Hellespont, but on his way he was met by the messengers of Mithridates, who in- formed him that their master agreed to all the articles proposed, except to that which related to the cession of Paphlagonia; and at the fame time made a merit of the preference he had given to Sylla in this treaty; as he might have obtain- ed more favourable terms from Fimbria. " That
is a traitor," said Sylla, " whom I small speedily
" punish x About 386,oco 1. 2 Vide Plutarch. in Lucullo.
c H A P. "' punish for his crimes. As for your master, I
xl y" ihall know, upon my descent in Asia, whether
"he choofes to have peace or war."
Being arrived at the Hellespont, he wasjoined by Lucullus with a number of veflels, which enabled him to pass the frait. Here he was met by another mefrage from Mithridates, desiring a personal inter- view; which was acdordingly held in the pretence of both armies, and at which the king of Pontus, after some expostulations, agreed to all the condi- tions already mentioned. In this he probably ated from policy, as well as from the necessity he felt in the present state of his affairs. He flill hoped, that in consequence of this treaty, he might turn the arms of Sylla against the Romans, and trufled that the peace he obtained for himself in Asia was to be the beginning of a war in Italy, more likely to distress his enemies than any efforts he himself could make against them. With this reasonable profped he retired into his own king- dom of Pontus; and there, firengthening himself by alliances and the acquisition of territory on the northern coasts of the Euxine, he prepared to take advantage of future emergencies, and to profit by the fate of confusion into which the affairs of the Romans were likely to fall.
Sylla having brought the Mithridatic war to an issue so honourable for himself, and having every where gratified his army with the spoils of their enemies, being poieifed of a considerable fum of money and a numerous fleet, and being secure of
the
the attachment of the legions, who had experiell- CH A '. ced his liberality, and refted their hopes in fu- - _V. ture on the success of his enterprize, prepared to take vengeance on his enemies, and those of the republic in Italy. He proceeded, however, with great deliberation and caution; and, as if the State at Rome were in perfec tranquillity, flaid to re- duce the army of Fimbria, to resettle the Roman province, and to effec the restoration of the aiiies, Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes, to their refpedive kingdoms of Cappadocia and Bithynia.
Fimbria being required by Sylla to resign a command which he had illegally usurpcd, retort- ed the charge of usurpation, and treated Sylla himself as an outlaw: but upon the approach of this general, being deserted by his army, he fled to Pergamus, and there had an end put to his life by the hands of a slave, of whom he exacted this service. To punish the province of Asia for its defedion to MitIlridates, Sylla obliged the inha- bitants to pay down a fum equal to five years or- dinary tax. He sent Curio to replace on their thrones the kings of Cappadocia and Bithynia, who had persevered in their alliance with Rome, and sent an account of these particulars to the Se- nate, without taking any notice of the edict by which he himself had been stripped of his com- mand, and declared an enemy'. Before he set fail, however, for Italy, he thought proper to transmit a memorial, setting forth his services and

concluding with menaces of justice against his own enemies and those of the republic, but affu- ring the citizens in general of protection and fecu- rity. This paper, being read in the Senate,. ap- peared to alarm many of the members, even those who had least to fear from the threats it contain- ed: wished for expedients to reconcile the par- ties, and to avert the evils which the republic must susser from their repeated contentions. A soothing answer was accordingly sent to the me- morial of Sylla, and earnest entreaties were made to Cinna, that he would suspend his levies until a reply could be obtained from his antagonist. u. c. 669. But Cinna, in contempt of these pacific intentions, L. Come- ius Cina took measures to sustain the war; divided the 4toi. n. fasces with Cn. Papirius Carbo, whom, without Papirius Carbo. any form of election, he assumed for his colleague
in the Consulate; and, in the partition of provin- ces, retained for himself the administration in Ita- ly, while he assigned to Carbo the command in the neighbouring Gaul. These titular magistrates, with all the adherents of their faction, betook themselves in haste to the forming of troops, and securing the fidelity of the towns within the feve- ral divisions which they had received in charge.
Carbo exacted hostages for their good behaviour from all the towns in his diftridt; but as he had not any regular authority from the Senate for this measure, he found himself unable to give it effect. To Caftricius, the chief magistrate of Placentia, a
person
perfoil of great age, who refused to comply with c H A P. his orders, " Have not I your life in my power ?" xtv. he said. " And have not I," said the other, " al- " ready had life enough ' ?'
Cinna, however, having muttered a considerable force, and intending to fiake head against Sylla in Theflaly, through which he was expected to pass in his way to Italy, was about to transport his army thither; when the troops being.averfe to embark, he himself, endeavouring to force them, was killed in a mutiny. A general disorder and anarchy pervaded the party. The election of a successor to Cinna was twice interrupted by sup- posed unfavourable presages, and Carbo remained sole Consul.
At this time an answer was received from Sylla to the proposals made by the Senate towards a recon- ciliation of parties. In this, he declared, " That ' he never could return into friendihip with per- " sons guilty of so many and such enormous " crimes. If the Roman people, however, were "pleated to grant an indemnity, he would not in- " terpofe, but should venture to affirm, that such " of the citizens as chore, in the present disorders, " to take refuge in his camp, would find them- " elves safer than in that of his enemy's." He had embarked his army at Ephesus, and in three days reached the Pyraeus, the port of Athens. Here he was taken ill of the gout, and was advi fed to use the hot baths at Adipfus; at which he

force of mind, as if divefled of all public or pri- vate distress, amused himself, in his usual way, with persons of humour, and ordinary company. His fleet, in the mean time, consisting of twelve hundred ships, coasted round the Peloponnefus, and took on board the army which had marched by Thefaly to Dyrachium. Being apprehensive that some part of the legions, upon landing in Ita- ly, and with so near a profpe&t of returning to their homes, might desert, or, trusting to their consequence in a civil war, might become difor- derly and diltrefs the inhabitants, he exaded a special oath, by which every man bound himself, upon his arrival in Italy, to abide by his colours, and to observe the ftricreft order in his march through the country. The troops, wishing to re- move all the remains of a diitruft which had fug- gefled this precaution, not.only took the oath, but made voluntary offer of a contribution towards the support of the war; and Sylla, without ac- cepting thte aid which was proffered to him, set fail with the additional confidence which this proof of attachment in the army inspired.
He had, according to Appian, five Roman le- gions, with fix thousand Italian horse, and con- fiderable levies from Macedonia and Greece, amounting in all to about sixty thousand men. With this force he landed in Italy, in the face of many different armies, each of them equal or fu- nerior in number to his own.

i .Nor. of the party, being in possession of the capital and i,'l,.0 of the place of eledtion, were named for Consuls. Norban's, as acing for the republic, commanded 'a great army in Apulia; Scipio, another on the confines of Campania. Sertorius, young Marius, with Carbo, in the quality of Proconsul, and others (as Plutarch quotes from the memoirs of Sylla) to the number of fifteen commanders, had each of them armies, amounting in all to four hundred and fifty cohorts '; but of these different bodies none attempted to dispute the landing of Sylla, nor, for some days, to interrupt his march. He according. ly continued to advance as in a friendly country, and in the midit of profound peace. The inhabi- tants of Italy, confidering the Iuperior class of the people at Rome, in whose cause now Sylla ap- peared, as averse to the claim they had made of being promifcu(ufly enrolled in the Tribes, were likely to oppose him, and to favour the fadion which had for some time prevailed in the State. To allay their fears, or to prevent their taking an active part against himself, Sylla summoned the leading men of the country towns as he pas- fed, and gave them afiurances that he would con- firm the grants which had been made to them, if they did not forfeit these and every other title.to

V. x verted the government.
On his march he was joined by Metellus Pius, who, as has been observed, after a fruitless attempt, in conjunction with the Consul OWtavius, to co- ver Rome from the attack of the elder Marius and Cinna, had withdrawn to Africa; and being for- ced irom thence by Fabius, returned into Italy. This officer being in Liguria, where he frill retain- ed the ensigns of Proconsul, had some forces on foot, and was sustaining the hopes of his party, when so great a change was made in their favour as was produced by the arrival, of an army from Greece.
Sylla was likewise, about the fame time, joined by Cneius Pompeius, son to the late Consul Pom- peius Strabo, who, though too young for any for- mal commission, had assembled a considerable bo- dy of men, and already made himself of importance in the present firuggle. Being now only aboutnine- teen years of age, he was remarked for engaging manners, and a manly aspea, which procured him a general favour and an uncommon degree of re- sped I'. This diftinaion being unsought for, was possibly felt by him as a birth-right, or gave him an early impreflion of that superiority to his fellow-citizens which he continued to bear through the whole of his life. He had served in those legions with which Cinna intended to have carried the war against Sylla into Afa or Greece; but, being av7rfe to the party, had withdrawn
when i ?lutarch. in Maeo.
when that army was about to embark, and dif- CH A P. appearing suddenly, was supposed to have been Xiv. murdered by the order of Cinna, a suspicion, which, among other circumstances, incited his fol- diers to the mutiny in which their general was killed. Sylla appears himself to have been won by the promising aspea of the young Pompey, and re- ceived him with distinguishing marks of regard.
Numbers of the Senate and Nobles, who had hitherto remained exposed at Rome to the insults of their enemies, now repaired to the camp of Sylla. The Consul Norbanus, being joined by young Marius, lay at Canufium. Sylla, while he was preparing to attack them, sent an officer with overtures of peace; these they rejeded with marks of contempt. This circumstance had an effect which Sylla perhaps foresaw or intended. It routed the indignation of his army, and, in the action which followed, had some effect in obtaining .a vitory, in which fix thousand ' of the enemy were killed, with the loss of only seventy men to ]limfelf.
Norbanus, after this defeat, retreated to Capua; and, being covered by the walls.of that place, waited the arrival of Scipio, who intended to join him with the army under his command. Sylla marched to Tianum to prevent theirjunaion; and, .on the approach of Scipio, proposed to negotiate. The leaders, with a few attendants, met between the two armies, and were nearly agreed upon
M 4 terms j Plutarch. in Syll. edit. London, p. S3.
c H A P. terms of peace; but Scipio delayed his final con-
4r sent until he should consult with Norbanus at Ca-
pua. Sertorius was accordingly dispatched to in- form Norbanus of what had passed, and hostilities were to be suspended until his return; but this meifenger, probably averse to the treaty, broke the truce, by seizing a pofl at Sueffa which had been occupied by Sylla; and the negotiation had no other effec than that of giving the troops of both armies, as well as their leaders, an opportunity of conferring together; a circumstance which, in civil wars, is always dangerous to one or other of the parties. In this cafe the popularity of Sylla prevailed; and the soldiers of his army, boafling of the wealth which they had acquired under their general, infected his enemies, and seduced them to desert their leader. Scipio was left almost alone in his camp; but Sylla, receiving the troops who deserted to him, made no attempt to seize their commander, suffered him to escape, and, with the accession of strength he had acquired by the juncdion of this army, continued his march to- wards Rome. Norbanus at the fame time evacuated Capua, and, by forced marches in a different route, arrived at the city before him.
About this time, Sertorius, who, before the war broke out, had, in the difirilution of provinces, been appointed Propretor of Spain, despairing of affairs in It;ly, in which probably he was not sus- ficicitiy consulted, repaired to his province, and determined to try what the Ikill of a Roman
leader
leader could effeat at the head of the warlike na- c H A P. tives of that country. XIV-
The chiefs of the Marian party, who remained in Italy, made efforts to collect all the forces they could at Rome. Carbo, upon hearing that the army of Scipio had been seduced to desert their leader, said, " We have to do with a lion and a t fox, of which the fox is probably the more dan- "gerous enemy of the two."
Norbanus, soon after his arrival at Rome, pro- cured an edia of the People, by which Metellus, and the others who had joined their forces with Sylla, were declared enemies to their country. A- bout the fame time a fire broke out in the Capitol, and the buildings were burnt to the ground. Va- rious suspicions were entertained of the cause; but as no party had any interest in this event, it was probably accidental, and served only to agitate the minds of the People, prone to superstition, and apt to find in every calamity alarming presages, as well as present distress.
The remainder of the season was spent by both parties in collecting their forces from every quar- ter of Italy; and the term of the Consuls il office being nearly expired, Carbo procured his own U. C.671.
C. Mariuw nomination to succeed them, and inscribed the Cn. Pap. name of a young Marius, scarcely twenty years of Carbo. age, as his colleague. This person is by some said to have been the nephew, by others the adopted ion, of the late celebrated C. Marius, whose name
had
H A P. had so long been terrible to the enemies, and at .xl X length not less so to the friends, of Rome.
At this time the Senate contented to have the plate and ornaments of the temples coined for the pay of the supposed Consular armies. The majo- rity of its members, however, notwithstanding this at of obsequiousness, were believed to favour the opposite party, and not fit to be trusted in cafe the city were attacked. In canfequence of this fufpi- cion, the whole being affembied together by orders of the Prators, Damafippus and Brutus, numbers were taken aside and put to death; of those defti- ned to die, Quintus Mucius Scaxvola, Pontifex Max- imus, flying to the temple in which he was accuf- tomed to discharge his sacred office, was killed in the porch.
The military operations of the following spring began with an obstinate fight between two confi- derable armies, one commanded by Metellus, the other by Carinas. The latter being defeated with great loss, Carbo hastened to the scene of aCtion, in order to cover the remains of the vanquished party.
In the mean time Sylla, being encamped at Se- tia, and having intelligence that the young Ma- rius was advancing against him, put his army in motion to meet him, forced him back to Sacripor- tum, near to Praenefte, where an action soon after ensued, in which Marius was defeated.
The routed army having fled in disorder to Prae- nefte, the first who arrived were received into the place but as it was apprehended that the enemy
aufo
also might enter in the tumult, the gates were CH A P. fllut, and many, being excluded, were slaughtered X'V. under the-ramparts. Marius himself escaped, by means of a rope which was let down from the battlements, and by which he was enabled to scale the walls.
In consequence of this vitory Sylla invested Praenefte; and as great numbers were thus fud- denly cooped up in a town, which was not prepa- red to fubfiil them, he had an immediate profpe& of feeing them reduced to the necessity of furren- dering at discretion. Committing the charge of a blockade for this purpose to Lucretius Offella, he himself, with part of the army, proceeded to Rome. Metellus, in a second action, had defeated the army of Carbo, and Pompey, another of the fame party near Sena; and thus the forces of Sylla be- ing victorious in every part of Italy, the city was prepared to receive their leader as soon as he mhould appear at the gates. Upon his approach the par- tizans of the opposite faction withdrew, and left him mailer of the capital.
Sylla having posted his army in the field of Mars, he himself entered the city, and calling an assem- bly of the People, delivered an harrangue, in which he imputed the disorder of the times to the injuf- tice and cruelty of. a few faaious men, who had overturned the government, and sacrificed the best blood of the republic to their ambition and to their personal resentments. He exhorted the well-dif- posed to be of good courage, and assured them th?t they Ihould soon have their freedom restored.
In
c HA P In the mean time, he gratified his own army with ,.2..' the spoils of the opposite party, declaring the effects
of all those to be forfeited who had been accef- fary to the crimes lately committed against the State. After this first specimen of his policy in the city, leaving a sufficient force to execute his orders, he hastened to Clufium, where Carbo, be- ing joined by a considerable reinforcement from Spain, was preparing to recover the metropolis, or to relieve his colleague Marius, who was reduced to great distress in Prxnefle.
The events which followed the arrival and ope- rations of Sylla in Tuscany were various, but for the most part unfavourable to Carbo, whose force, by desertion and the sword, was declining apace. The issue of the war seemed to depend on the fate of Prenefte, and the whole force of the party was therefore directed to the relief of that place. The Lucanians and Samnites, who had espoused the cause of the late Caius Marius, and who, by his favour, had obtained the promiscuous enrolment to which they aspired, apprehending immediate ruin to themselves, in the fuppreilon of a party by whom alone they had been favoured, determined to make one great effort for the relief of Prxenefte.
They were joined in Latium by a large detach- ment sent by Carbo, under Carinas and Marcius, and made an attempt to force the lines of the be- fiegers at Prxnelle, and to open the blockade of that place. But having failed in this design, they *-rned, with desperation, on the city of Rome itself,
which
which was but slightly guarded by a small detach- c H A P.
xiv. ment which had been left for that purpose. Syl- xv la being informed of their intention, with haity marches returned to the city, and found the ene- my already in possession of the suburbs, and pre- paring to force the gates.
It was about four in the afternoon when he ar- rived, after a long march. Some of his officers proposed, that the troops, being fatigued, should have a little time to repose themselves; and that, for this purpose, they should remain under cover of the walls until the following day. Sylla, how- ever, proposing, rather by his unexpected pretence, and by coming to ation at an unufual.hour, to fur- prise the enemy, gave orders for an immediate at- tack. The event for tome time was: doubtful; the wing that was led by himself was. repulsed, or did not make the impression expeced; but the other wing under Crasiss had a better fortune, put the enemy to flight, and drove them to Antermne.
The action, though thus various in the different parts of it, became, in the event, completely deci- live. Eighty thousand of the Marian party were killed in their flight, and eight thousand taken. Carbo, in despair of the cause, fled into Sicily. The troops who were blocked up in Praenefte, ha- ving no longer any hopes of relief, surrendered themselves, and the whole party was dispersed or cut off. The young Marius attempted to escape by the galleries of a mine, of which there were ma-
nly
C H A P. ny under the place I; and being prevented, killed
xlv. < - himself. His head was carried to Sylla, and by
his order exposed in the market-place. (' That
boy," he said, " ihould have learnt to row be- fore he attempted to steer !" The leader of the victorious party having now removed all impediments from his way, proceeded to retaliate on the authors of the late disorders with a force equal to the violence with which it had been provoked. About fix or eight thousand of those who were supposed to have been the bus fieft instruments of the late usurpations and mur- ders, being taken prisoners in the war, or surprised in the city, were, by his direction, ihut up in the circus, and inflantly put to death.
While this horrid scene was acting, he had ai; fembled the Senate, at a little distance, in the tem- ple of Bellona; and as many of the members then present had either favoured, or at least tamely sub- mitted to the late usurpation, he made them a speech on the state of the republic, in which he reproached them as accessary to the late difor- ders, and admonished them, for the future, to re- sped the legal government and constitution of their country. In the mkidft of these admonitions, the cries of those who were slaughtered in the cir- cus reaching their ears, the assembly was greatly alarmed, and many of the members flarted from their feats. Sylla, with a countenance fiern, but undisturbed, checked them as for an inflance of
levity. i Vid. Strabo, lib. v. p. 239.
levity. " Be composed," he said, " and aftend CH A P. "to the business for which your are called. WVhat XI . " you hear are no more than the cries of a few
wretches, who are suffering the punishment due to their crimes." From this interruption he reiumed his subjed, and continued speaking till the massacre of there unhappy viaims was com- pleted.
In a harangue which lie afterwards delivered to the People, he spoke of his own services to the republic, and of the miifdemeanour of others, in terms that itruck all who heard him with terror. ( The republic," he said (if his opinion were fol- lowed), " should be purged ; but whether it were " so or no, the injuries done to himself and his "friends ihould be punished." He accordingly ordered military execution against every person who had been acceflary to the late mafacres and usurpations; and while the sword was yet reek- ing in his hands, passed great part of his time, as usual, in mirth and dissipation with men of hu- mourous and singular charadcers. He deigned not even to inquire into the abuses that were commit- ted in the execution of his general plan. Many of the disorders which took place in the formcr maf- sacre were accordingly renewed. The persons who were employed in it, frequently indulged their own private resentment and their avarice in the choice of vitims. Among these, Cataline, then a young man, had joined the vitorious party; and plunged, with a singular impetuosity, into the midfl
of
C H AP. of a storm which now overwhelmed a part of the xlv- city. He is said, among other persons to whom
he bore an aversion, or whose effetes he intended to seize, to have murdered his own brother, with strange circumstances of cruelty and horror.
While these dreadful murders, though mixed with examples of a just execution, were perpe- trated, a young man, C. Metellus, had the courage to address himself to Sylla in the Senate, and de- fired he would make known the extent of his de- sign, and how far these executions were to be car- ried ? " We intercede not," he said, " for the con- "demned; we only entreat that you would re-
lieve out of this dreadful slate of uncertainty "all those whom in reality you mean to spare."
Sylla, without being offended at this freedom, published a lift of those he had doomed to deftruc- tion, offering a reward of two talents for the head of each, and denouncing revere penalties against every person who flould harbour or conceal them. Hence arose the pracice of publifihing lifts of the persons to be mafTcred, which under the odious name of ,Proscription, was afterwards imitated with such fatal effects in the subsequent convulsions of the State.
The present proscription, although it promised some security to all who were not comprehended in the fatal lift, opened a scene, in some refpets, more dreadful than' that which had been formerly aaed in this massacre. By the promised reward, the hands of servants were hired against their ma-
tfers
fters, and even those of children againaf their parents. c H A p. The mercenary of every denomination were en- ._y. couraged, by a great premium, to commit what be- tore only the executioners of public juflice thought themselves entitled to perform; and there followed a scene, in which human nature had full scope to exert all the evil of which it is susceptible, treach- ery, ingratitude, distrust, malice, and revenge; and would have retained no claim to our esteem or commiseration, if its character had not been re- deemed by contrary instances of fidelity, genero- lity, and courage, displayed by those who, to pre- serve their friends and benefadors, or even to pre- serve mere objects of pity, who took r-efiige under their protecion, rilked all the dangers with which the proscribed themselves were threatened.
In consequence of these measures, about five thousand persons ofconfidcration were put to death, among whom were reckoned forty Senators, and sixteen hundred of the Equestrian order.
From there beginnings the Romans had reafofi to apprehend a tyranny, more languinary perhaps than any that ever alllicded mankind. " If in the '' field you flay all wlho are fuund in arms against "you," said Catulus ', " and in the city you flay "even' the unarmed ; over whoin do you propore "to reign ?"
These reproaches Wvere by. Sylla received a3 jcfts; and the freedom and ease of his manners, is well. as the profeflions he made of regard to
Vor. II. N the r P -'.h:.!,J the 'n, of iin r. 9 C (erill:c]i n1 tite ^'nt r c f J2bi': .
c 1 x r. the commonwealth, were imputed to infcnfibility,
xv. , or to a barbarous dillimulation, which rendered
his character more odious, and the profpedt of his future intentions more terrifying.
In comparing the present with the late ufurpa- tion and massacre, men recolleted, that Marius, from his infancy, had been of a revere and inexor- able temper; that his resentments were sanguinary, and even his frowns were deadly; but that his cruel- ties were the effct of real paflions, and had the apo- logy of not being perpetrated in cold blood; that every person on whom he looked with indifference was safe; and that even when he usurped the go- vernment of the State, as soon as his personal re- fentments were gratified, the sword in his hand be- came an innocent pageant, and the mere ensign or badge of his power. But that Sylla direded a massacre in the midst of composure and ease: that as a private man he had been affable and pleasant, even noted for humanity and candour I; that the change of his temper having commenced with his exaltation, there w.ere no hopes that the issues of blood could be flopped while he was suffered to retain his power. His daring spirit, his address, his cunning, and his ascendant over the minds of men, rendered the profpcd of a deliverance, if not def- perate, extremely remote. The republic seemed to be extinguilhed for ever; and if the rage for blood seemed to abate, after the first heats of exe- cution were over, it appeared to be flayed only for
w ant : !'ik Il. in Sy'!.,
ivant of victims, not from any principle of modera- c H A P.
'IV. tion, or fentlinent of clemency.
Such was the aspcd of alfairs, and the grounds of terror conceived even by tliofe who were inno- cent of the late difordersr; but to those who lhad ieafon to fear the rcentmeent of the victor, the prospect was altogether dcfperate. Norbanus, hav- ing fled to Rhodes, received at that place an ac- count of the profcriptioijs, and, to avoid being de- livered up, killed himself. Carilo, being in Sicily, endeavoured to make his escape from thence, but was apprehended by Pompey, and killed. Thus all the ordinary offices of State were vacated by the .desertion or death of those who had filled or usurp- ed them.
Sylla had hitherto aatcd as master, without any other title than that of the fivord; and it was now thought necessary to supply the defect. He re- tired from the city, that the Senate might assemble With the more appearance of freedom. To name an Interrex was the usual expedient for reltoring the constitution; and for proceeding to elediolns in a legal form after the usual time had elapsed, or when by any accident the ordinary succession to office had been interrupted. Valerius Flaccus was named. To him Sylla gave intimation, that, to re- fettle the commonwealth, a Didtator, for an indefi- nite term, should be appointed, and made offer of his own services for this purpose. These intima- tions were received as commands. And F laccus, having afiembl)ed the People, moved for an ad to
N - veit
c H A P. vest Sylla with the title of Dictator, giving him a
_--N. discretionary power over the persons, fortunes, and
lives of all the citizens.
No example of this kind had taken place for one hundred and twenty years preceding. this date. In the former part of that period, the jealousy of the aristocracy, and in the latter part of it, the nega- tive of the Tribunes, had always prevented a mea- sure from which the parties severally apprehended some danger to themselves. It was now revived in the person of Sylla with unusual solemnity, and ratified by an acd of the People, in which they yielded up at once all their own claims to the so- vereignty, and submitted to monarchy for an in- definite time. Sylla having named Valerius Flac- cus for his lieutenant or commander of the horse, returned to the city, presenting a fight that was then unusual, a tingle person, preceded by four- and-twenty Litors, ari:ed with the axe and the rods; and the Ditator being likewise attended by a numerous military guard, it was not doubted that these ensigns of magittracy were to be employed, not for parade, but for serious execution, and were speedily to be Rained with the blood of many ci- tizens, whom the sword had spared. Unwilling to be troubled with ordinary affairs, and that the city, in all matters in which it was not necef- fary for himfeltf to interpose, might still enjoy the benefit of its ufiual forms, he directed the Peo- ple to aflemble, and to fill up the cuflomary lifts of office.
Luc:reti uq
Lucretius Offella, the officer who had command- c .I A P. ed in the reduction of Pranefte, presuming on his 2V. favour with the Didtator, and on his consequence with the army, offered himself for the Conlulate. Being commanded by Sylla.to defif, he still con- tinued his canvas, and w hile he solicited votes in the fireet, was, -by .order of the Dictator, put to death. A tumult immediately arose.; the Cen- turion, who executed this order against Offella, was seized, and, attended by a great concourse of people, was carried before the Dictator. Sylla heard the complaint with composure, told the mul- titude who crowded around him, that Offella had been slain by his orders, and that the Centurion must therefore be ,released. He then dismisscd them, with this homely but menacing apologue. "A countryman at his plough, feeling himself " troubled with vermtin, once and again made a
halt to pick-them otf his jacket; but being mo- lefted a third time, he threw the jacket, with all "its contents, into the fire. Beware," he said, " of " the fire; provoke me not a third time'." Such was the tone of a government, which, from this example, was likely to be fatal to many who had concurred in efabliflling of it, as well as to those of the opposite party.
Sylla, soon after his elevation to the state of U. c.672. Didator, proceeded to make his arrangements and Decula, to new-model the commonwealth. The army ' o.

It appears that Li:.y re-koncd fly.f-evcn legiion, EpItorn. lib. Ixx.xi:.
c IH p. appeared to have the first or preferable claim to
iV^. his attention. He accordingly proposed to reward
them by a gift of all the lands which had been forfeited by the adherents of the opposite party. Spoletum, Interamna, Prznefie, Fluentia, Nola, Sulmo, Volaterra, together with the countries of Samnium and Lucania, were depopulated to make way for the legions who had served under himself in the reduction of his enemies. In these new in- habitants of Italy, whose prosperity depended on his fafcty, he had a guard to his person, and a sure support to his power. By changing their condi- tion from that of soldiers to land-holders and pea. sants, he dispelled, at the fame time, that dange- rous cloud of military power, which he himself or his antagonilts had railed over the common- wealth, and provided for the permanency of any reformations he was to introduce into the civil efta- blifiment. The troops, from soldiers of fortune, became proprietors of land, and interested in the preservation of peace. In this manner, whatever may have been his intention in this arbitrary aft of power, so cruel to the innocent sufferers, if there were any such, the measure had an immediate tendency to terminate the public confusion. Its future consequences, in pointing out to new ar- mies, and to their ambitious leaders, a way to sup- plant their fellow-citizens in their property, and to pradtife usurpations more permanent than that of .yia, were probably not then foreseen.
The next act of the Dictator appears more en-
tirely
tirely calculated for the security of his own per- c H A P. son. A body of ten thousand slaves, lately the x. property of persons involved in the ruin of the van- quilhed party, having their freedom and the right of citizens conferred.on them, were enrolled pro- miicuoufly in all the Tribes; and as the enfran- chifed slave took the name of the person from whom he received his freedom, there new ci- tizens became an accession to the family of the Cornelii, and in every tumult were likely to be the sure partizans of Sylla, and the abetters of his power. They had received a freedom which was conneded with the permanency of his go- vernment, and foresaw, that, if the leaders of the opposite party, in whose houses they had served. should be restored, they themfeives m.uit return in- to servitude; and they accordingly became an ad- ditional security to the government which their patron was about to eftablifll.
So far the Diclator seemed to intend the fecuri- ty of his own pcrfon, and the stability of his go- vernment; but in all his fabfequent institutions, there appears an intention to restore the conftitu- tion in its legislative and judicative departments, to provide a proper supply of officers for conducting the accumulated affairs of the commonwealth, to flop the source of former disorders, and to guard a- gainll the growing depravity of the times, by cx- 'tending and securing the execution of the laws. He began with filling up the rolls of the Senate, which had been greatly reduced by the war, and
7- 4 h'
C HA' t. by the faniguinary policy of the parties who had
i__ prevailed in their turns. He augmented the num-
ber of this body to five hundred; taking the new members from the Equestrian order, but leaving the choice of them to the People. -ex deJu. The legislative power of the Senate, and the lC'II. judicative power of its members, were restored.
The law that was provided for the last of these purposes confisled of different clauses. By the first clause it was enated, that none but Senators, or those who were entitled to give their opinion in the Senate , should be put upon any jury or lift ps the judges 2. By the second it was provided, that, of the judges so placed on the roll, the par- ties ihould not be allowed to challenge or reject above three.
By a third clauss it was allowed, that judgment. in trials at law, flould be given either by secret ballot, or openly, at the option of the defendant; and, by a separate regulation, that the nomination of officers to command in the provinces, with the title of Proconsul, ihould be committed to the Senate.
During the late tribunitian usurpation, the whole legislative and executive power had, under pretence of vefling those prerogatives in the als fembly of the Tribes, been seized by the Tri- bunes. Bat Sylla rceiorcd the ancient form of as-

He more- over subjoined, that none but Senators could be eleted into the office of Tribune; and, to the end that no person of a fadtious ambition might choose this station, he procured it to be enated, that no one who had borne the office of Tribune could afterwards be promoted into any other rank of the magilftacy.
With refped to the offices of State, this new founder of the commonwealth revived the obfo- lete law which prohibited the re-election of any person into theConfulate, till after an interval of ten years ; and enacted, that none could be eled- ed Consul till after he had been Questor, jEdile} and Praetor. He augmented the number of Prae- tors from fix to eight ; that of Qlxeftors to twen- ty; and, to guard against the disorders which had recently afflicted the republic, declared it to be treason for any Roman officer, without the autho- rity of the Senate and People, to go beyond the limits of his own province, whether with or with- out an army, to make war, or to invade any foreign nation whatever.
He repealed the law of Domitius relating to the FleAion of priests, and restored to the college the entire choice of their own memncbers.
lHe made ievcral additions to the penri cc.e,
by
c HA P. by statutes against subornation, forgery, wilful fire, X'V. poisoning, rape, assault, extortion, and forcibly en-
tering the house of a citizen; with a statute, de- daring it criminal to be found, in places of public resort, with a deadly weapon of any kind. To all these he added a sumptuary law, of which the te- nor is not precisely known; but it appears to have regulated the expence at ordinary meals and at f, ', -4 is, and to have likewise fettled the price of provisions.
These laws were promulgated at certain inter- vals, and intermixed with the measures which -were taken to restore the peace of the empire. In order to fimfhi the remains of the civil war, Pompey had been sent into Sicily and Africa, -and C. Annius Lufcus into Spain. In this pro- -vince, Sertorius had taken arms for the 'Marian faction; but being attacked by the forces of Syl- la, and ill supported at first by the natives of Spain, he fled into Africa. From thence, hearing that the Lufitanians were disposed to take arms against the reigning party at Rome, he repassed the sea, put himself at their head, and in this situation was able, for some years, to find occupation for the arms of the republic, and for its moit experienced comnanders.
Soon after the departure of Svlla from Aria, .MIrcna, whom he had left to commnand in that provilncc, isounct a pretcnce to renew the w ar with Mithridates; and, having ventured to patl the
Halys,,
Halys, was defeated by that prince, and afterwards c H A P. arraigned as having infringed the late treaty of xV., peace. This accusation was favourably received at Rome; the conduct of Murena censured, and first A. Gabinius, and afterwards Minucius Ther- mus, were lent to supersede him in the province.
Mean time Sylla, with all his disdain of personal diftindion exhibited a triumph on account of his vi('ories in Alia and Greece. Processions were continued for two days. On the first, he deposited in the treasury fifteen thousand pondo of gold x, and an hundred and fifteen thousand pondo of fil- ver 2; on the second day, thirteen thousand pondo of gold 3, and seven thousand pondo of silver 4. There was nothing that had any reference to his victory in the civil war, except a numerous train of Senators, and other citizens of rank, who, having retorted to his camp for protection, had been re- flored by him to their estates and their dignities, and now followed his chariot, calling him Father, and the Deliverer of his Country.
Upon the return of the elections, Sylla was U. c. 673.

Cmecil. Pye- Metellus. The latter was defiined, at the expir- tell. Pius. tion of his office, to command against Sertorius in Spain. Sylla himielf still retained the Didtatorial power, and was employed in promulgating some of the acts of which the chief have been mentioned.

CHAP. Pompey having, in the preceding year, by the
. death of Carbo, and the dispersion of his party,
finiihed the remains of the civil war in Sicily, was now ordered by the Senate to transport his army into Africa. There Domitius, a leader of the oppo- iite fairion, had ereaced his standard, affembled'fome remains of the vanquished party, and received all the fugitives who crowded for refuge to his camp. Pompey accordingly being to depart from Sicily, leaving the command of that island to Memmius, and embarked his army, consisting of fix legions, in two divisions; of which one landed at Utica, the other in the bay of Carthage. Having soon after come to an engagement with Domitius, who had been joined by Jarbas, an African prince, he obtain- ed a complete victlory over their united forces, and pursuing his advantage, penetrated, without any refiitance, into the kingdom of Numidia, which, though dependant on the Romans, had not yet been reduced to the form of a province.
The war being ended in this quarter, Sylla thkougght proper to supersede Pompey in the pro- vince, and ordered him to disband his army, re- serving only one legion, with which he was to wait for his fuccefor. The troops were greatly incensed at this order; and, thinking themselves equally entitled to settlements with the legions who were lately provided for in Italy, refuted to lay down their arms. They earnestly entreated their gene- ral to embark for Rome, where they promised to make him maflcr of the government. This young
lmap,
man, with a moderation which he continued to CHAP support in the height of his ambition, withstood ' the temptation, and declared to the army, that, if they persisted in their purpose, he must certainly die by his own hands; that he would not do vio- lence to the government of his country, nor be the objet or pretence of a civil war. From this con- dudt we have reason to conclude that, if in reality he had encouraged the mutiny, it was only that he might thus have the honour of reclaiming the soldiers, and of rejeding their offer. The ambi- tion of this singular person, as will appear from many passages of his life, led him to aim at con- iideration more than power.
While Pompey was endeavouring to bring the troops to their duty, a report was carried to Rome, that he had actually revolted, and was preparing, with his army, to make a descent upon Italy. " It appears to be my fate," said Sylla, " in my "old age, to fight with boys ;" and he was about to recal the veterans to his standard, when the truth was made known, and the part which Pom- pey had acted was properly :.represented. The merit of this young man on that occasion was the greater, that he himself was unwilling to disband the army before they ihould return to Italy to at- tend a triumph, which he hoped to obtain ; and that the resolution he took to comply with his or- ders, proceeded from refped to the Senate, and deference to the authority of the State.
Sylla,
C H A P. Sylla, won by the behaviour of Pompey on this xiv. occalion, was inclined to difpenfc with his former
commands, and accordingly moved in the affnm- bly of the People, that the legions serving in As- rica might return with their arms-into Italy.
This motion was opposed by C. Herennius, Tri- bune of the People, who ventured to employ the prerogative of his office, however impaired, againil the power of the Didator. But Sylla persisted; obtained a law to authorise Pompey to enter with his army into Italy; and when he drew near the city, went forth with a numerous body of the Se- nate to receive him. On this occasion, it is said, that, by calling him the Great Pompey, Sylla fix- ed a designation upon him, which, in the Roman way of distinguishing persons by casual additions, whether of contempt or refpe&, continued to fur- nifh him with a title for life. The times were wretched when armies stated themselves in the commonwealth as the partizans of a leader, and when the leader, by not making war on his coun- try, was supposed to have laid up a store of merit.
Pompey, upon this occasion, laid claim to a tri- umph. Sylla at firit opposed it as being contra- ry to the rule and order of the commonwealth, which reserved this honour for persons who had attained to the rank either of Consul or Praetor; but he afterwards complied, being struck, it is said, with a mutinous faying of this aspiring young man, bidding him recolled, that there were more per-
ions
,ons disposed to wcrfhip the pifing than the setting c I A 1p. 11 XIV.
In the triumph which Pompey accordingly ob- tained, he incant to have entered the city on a car- riage drawn by elephants; but these animals could not pass abreait through the gates. His donation to the troops falling short of their expedation, and they having murmured, and even threatened to mu- tiny, he said, the fear of losing his triumph flould not affect him ; that he would irntantly diband the legions, rather than comply with their unrea- fonable demands. This check, given to the pre-- fumption of the army by an officer so young and so aspiring, gave a general fatisi&'Cion. P. Servi- lius, a Senator of advanced age, said, upon this eccafion, " That the young man hlad at lait defer- ' ved his triumph and his title." Pompey, by his vanity in demanding a triumph contrary to the eftablifled order of the common- wealth, had impaired the lustre of his former ac- tions ; by this last acd of magnanimity, in refirain- ing the insolence of the troops, he forfeited the as- fedtions of the army; and in both theie circum- flances together, gave a complete fpecimcn and image of his whole life. WVith too much rfpel for the republic to employ violent means for its ruin, he was poflefl'ed by a vanity and a jealousy of his own personal consideration, which, in de- tail, perpetually led him to undermine its founda- tions.
Uto):
C H A P. Upon the return of-the elections, Sylla was again _, v. destined for one of the Consuls; but he declined U. C. 674. . Servili- this piece of flattery, and dire&ed the choice to Cladius. fhll on P. Servilius and Appius Claudius. Soon
after these magistrates entered on the discharge of their trull; the Dictator appeared, as usual, in the Forum, attended by twenty-four Lictors; but, in- stead of proceeding to any exercise of his power, made a formal resignation of it, difmiifed his Lic- tors, and, having declared to the People, that, if any one had matter of charge against him, he was ready to answer it, continued to walk in the streets in the character of a private man, and afterwards retired to his villa near Cumae, where he exerci- fed himself in hunting ', and other country amuse- ments.
This resignation, it must be confefled, throws a new light on the character of Sylla, and removes him far from the herd of common usurpers, who lacrifice their fellow-creatures merely to their own lulf of dominion. The sacrifices he made, mlock- ing as they were to the feelings of humanity, now appear to have been offered at the filrine of public order, to provide for the future peace to his country. His ruling passion appears to have been disdain of what the vulgar admire, whe- ther diftintion or power. When tired of youth- ful purflits, he sued for preferment, but with to little animosity or jealousy of competition, that if he had not been hurried by extreme provoca-
tio(l i Appjian, Bell. C il b.i.
tion into the violent course he pursued; it is pro- c H A P. bable that he never would have been heard of, XIV. but upon the roll' of Consuls, or the record of his triumphs, and would have disdained any en- croachment-on the right of his fellow-citizens as much as he resented the encroachments which were made on his own.
In his first attack of the city with a military force, his whole ation ihowed, that he meant to rescue the Republic from the usurpation of Ma- rius, not to usurp the Government for-himfelf. At his return into Italy from the Mithridatic war, the itate 6f parties already engaged in hostilities, and the violence done to the Republic by those who pretended to govern it, will abundantly jufiify his having had recourse to arms.
During the Ihort period in which he retained his power of Dictator, without neglecting precautions for the security of his own person in the retire- ment he was meditating, he took the measures al- ready mentioned, to tear up the roots of future dif- 'order, and effect some reform in the State: but as the palt had flown, what are the evils to which an overgrown and corrupted Republic is exposed; so the corrections he attempted, although they served to prolong the itruggles of virtuous men for the preservation of their country, yet were not sus- ficient to prevent its ruin.
For some particulars of his description, which have not entered into the preceding narration, it may be observed, that he was among the few Ro-
VOL. II. 0 mans
C H A P. mIans of his time who made any considerable ad- XIV. '- .' vance in literary studies; and that he wrote me-
moirs of his own life, continued to within a few days of his death, often quoted by Plutarch. That he nevertheless appeared superior to the reputation of his. own most splendid performances, and from simplicity or disdain, mixed perhaps with fuperfli- tion, not from asseted modesty, attributed his fuc- cess to good fortune or to the favour of the gods; so much, that while he bestowed on Pompey the ti- tle of Great, he himself was content with that of the Fortunate '.
With refped to such a personage, circumstances of a trivial nature become fubjets of attention. His hair and eyes, it is said, were of a light co- lour, his complexion fair, and his countenance blotched. He was, by the most probable accounts, four years old at the time of the sedition of Ti- berius Gracchus, and seventeen at the death of Caius, the younger brother of Tiberius; so that he might have perceived at this date the effect of tribunitian disorders, and taken the impressions from which he aded againit them. He served the office of Quaefior under Marius in Africa at thir- ty-one; was Consul for the firit time at forty-nine or fifty 2; was Didator at fifty-fix; resigned when turned of fifty-eight; and died yet under sixty, in the year which followed that of his refigna- tion.
There remained in the city, at his death, a nu-
merous I Felix. 2 Vel. Pater. lib. ii. c. 17.
mnerous body of new citizens, who having been c A P. manumifed by his order, bore his name: in the XIV. country a frill more numerous body of veteran of- ficers and soldiers, who held estates by his gift: numbers throughout the empire, who owed their safety to his protection, and who ascribed the ex- iRtence of the commonwealth itself to the exer- tions of his great ability and courage: numbers who, although they were offended with the severe and bloody exercise of his power, yet admired the magnanimity of his resignation.
When he was no longer an object of flattery, his corpse was carried in procession through Italy at the public expence. The fasces, and every other ensign of honour, were restored to the dead. A- bove two thousand golden crowns were fabricated in haste, by order of the towns and provinces he had protected, or of the private persons he had preserved, to testify their veneration for his memo- ry. Roman matrons, whom it might be expeced his cruelties would have affected with horror, loft every other sentiment in that of admiration, crowd- ed to his funeral, and heaped the pile with per- fumes . His obsequies were performed in the Cam- pus Martius. The tomb was marked by his own directions with a charaderiftical inscription, to the following effet : " Here lies Sylla, who never "was outdone in good offices by his friend, nor in " ads of hostility by his enemy '."

P 'HE public was so much occupied with the %----. t contest of Sylla and his antagonists, that little
else is recorded of the period in which it took place. Writers have not given us any diftinet account of the condition of the city, or of the number of citi- zens. As the State was divided into two principal fations, the office of Censor was become too im- portant for either party to entrust it with their op- ponents, or even in neutral hands. The leaders of every facion, in their turn, made up the rolls of the People, and disposed, at their pleasure, of the equestrian and senatorian dignities.
At
At a survey of the city, which is mentioned by c H A P. Livy', preceding the admission of the Italians, the number of citizens was three hundred and ninety-four thousand three hundred and thirty-fix. At another fuivey, which followed soon after that event, they amounted, according to Eusebius, to four hundred and fixty-three thousand2; and it seems that the whole accession of citizens from the country made no more than fixty-eight thousand fix hundred and fixty-four. The great slaughter of Romans and Italians, in which it is said that three hundred thousand men were killed, preced- ing the last of these musters, and the difficulty of making complete and accurate lifts when the citi- zens were so much dispersed, will account for the feemilngly small increase of their numbers.
In this period were born, and began to enter on the scene of public affairs, those persons whose conduct was now to determine the fate of the Re- public. Pompey had already diftinguihed him- self, and stood high in the public esteem. He had been educated in the camp of his father, and, by accident, at a very early age, or before he had attained to any of the ordinary civil or political preferments, commanded an army. Cicero, being of the fame age, began to be diftinguifled at the bar. He pleaded, in the second consulate of Sylla, the cause of Roscius Amerinus, and having oc- cafion to censure the actions of Chryfogonus and

c ; A P. other favourites of the Diaator, by his freedom
xv. V_,L in that instance, incurred no resentment from SyI-
la, and gained much honour to himself
Caius Caesar, now connected with the family of Cinna, whose daughter he had married, and being nearly related to the elder Marius, who had mar- ried his aunt, narrowly escaped the sword of the pre- vailing party. Being commanded to separate from his wife, he retained her in defiance of this order, and for his contumacy was put in the lift of the proscribed. He was saved, however, by the in- terceffion of common friends, whose request in his favour Sylla granted, with that memorable faying, " Beware of him: there is many a Ma- " rius in the person of that young man." A cir- cumfiance which marked at once the penetration of Sylla, and the early appearances of an extraor- dinary charadcer in Cafar.
Marcus Porcius, afterwards named Cato of Uti- ca, was about three years younger than Caesar, and being early an orphan, was educated in the house of an uncle, Livius Drufus. While yet a child, listening to the conversation of the times, he learn- ed that the pretensions of the Italian allies, then in agitation, were dangerous to the Roman Rate. Pompedius Silo, who managed the claim for the Italians, amusing himself with the young Cato, pressed him with caresses to intercede with his uncle in their behalf; and, finding that he was not to be won by flattery, next tried in vain to intimidate by threatening to throw him from the window. " If this were a man," he said, " I
" believe
" believe we ihould obtain no such favour." In c H A P.
xv. -the height of Sylla's military executions, when _, ' his portico was crowded with persons who brought the heads of the proscribed to be exchanged for the reward which had been published, Cato being carried by his tutor to pay his court, asked, "if no · one hated this man enough to kill him ?" "yes, "but they fear him still more than they hate him." (' Then give me a sword," said the boy, " and I " will kill him." Such were the early indications of characters which afterwards became so confpi- cuous in the commonwealth.
With the unprececdnted degradation of the Tribune Odavius, and the subsequent murder of Tiberius Gracchus, began, among the parties at Rome, a scene of injuries and retaliations, with alternate periods of anarchy and violent ufurpa- tion, which mufft have speedily ended in the ruin of the commonwealth, if the sword had not passed at last into hands which employed it for the refto- ration of public order, as well as for the avenging of private wrongs.
It is indeed probable, that none of the parties in these horrid scenes had a deliberate intention to subvert the government, but all of them treated the forms of the commonwealth with too little re- fpeat; and, to obtain some revenge of the wrongs which they themselves apprehended or endured, did not scruple in their turn to violate the laws of their country. But to those who wished to pre- serve the commonwealth, the experience of fifty
0 4 years
c H A P. years was now sufficient to filow, that attempts to
XV. ·.. , restore the laws by illegal methods, and to termi-
nate aninofities by retorted injuries and provoca- tions were extremely vain. The excess of the evil had a tendency to exhaust its source, and parties began to nauteate the draught of which they had been made to drink so largely. There were, neverthelelf, some dregs in the bottom of the cup, and the supplies of faction which were brought by the riling generation, were of a mix- ture more dangeious than thole of the former age. The example of Sylla, who made himself lord of the commonwealth by means of a military force, and the security with which he held his utfrpa- tion during pleasure, had a more powerful effect in exciting the thirst of dominion, than the poli- tical uses which he made of his power, or his magnanimity in resigning it. had to restrain or to correct the efflcts of that dangerous precedent. Adventurers accordingly arose, who, without pro- vocation, and equally inditlerent to the interels of party as they were to those of the republic, pro- ceeded, with a ;cool and deliberate purpose, to gratify their own ambition and avarice, by sub- verting the government of their country. v. C. 675. While Sylla was yet alive, Emnilius Lepidus, a /'4 .1r. Le- pida, Q. man of profligate ambition, but of mean capacity, Lot. Catulus, Co;S. supported by the remains of the popular faction,
flood for the Consulate, and was chosen, together with Q. Lutatius Catulus, the son of him who, w.ith Marius, triumphed for their joint vidory
over
over the Cimbri, and who afterwards perilhed by CHAP.
XV. the orders of that usurper.
Pompey had openly joined the popular fation in support of Lepidus, and was told upon that oc- cafion by Sylla, that he was stirring the embers of a fire which would in the end consume the Re- public. After the death of Sylla, from a mark of disapprobation well known to the Romans, that of not being mentioned in his will, it appeared that Pompey had loft his esteem. In opposition to Le- pidus, however, and others, who wished to insult the memory of Sylla, this prudent young man was among the first in recommending and performing the honours that were paid to his remains.
Lepidus, upon his accession to the Consulate, moved for a recal of the proscribed exiles, a refti- tution of the forfeited lands, and a repeal of all the ordinances of the late Dictator. This motion was formally opposed by Catulus; and there en- sued between the two Consuls a debate which di. vided the city. But the party of the Senate pre- vailed to have the motion rejected.
In the allotment of provinces the Transalpine Gaul had fallen to Lepidus; and, upon his mo- tion being rejected in the assembly of the People, although it had been some time the practice for Consuls to remain at Rome during their continu- ance in office, he prepared to leave the city, in or- der to take ponfeffion of his province. This refo- lution, as it implied great impatience to be at the head of an army, gave some jealousy to the Se-
nate,
CH A P. nate, who dreaded the designs of a Consul defi-
XV.
' rous to join military power with his civil autho-
rity. They recolleced the progress of sedition which began with the Gracchi and Apuleius raif- ing popular tumults, and ended with Marius and Sylla leading Consular armies into the city, and fighting their battles in the streets. And in this point the decisive spirit of Sylla, although it may have snatched the commonwealth from the flames by which it began to be consumed, yet Ihowed the way to its ruin in the means which he em- ployed to preserve it . The Senators were will- ing that Lepidus Ihould depart from the city; but they had the precaution to exa& from him an oath, that he should not disturb the public peace. This oath, to avoid the appearance of any parti- cular distrust of the person for whom it was pro- jeaed, they likewise administered to his colleague 2.
Lepidus, notwithstanding his oath, being arriv- ed in his province, made preparations for war; and, thinking that his faith was pledged only while he was Consul, determined to remain in Gaul at the head of his forces until his term in office expired. The Senate, in order to remove him from the army he had raised, appointed him to preside at the election of his successor. But he negleced the summons which was sent to him for this purpose, and the year of the present Consuls
was i Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. i, a Ibid,
was by this means suffered to elapse, before any CHAP. election was made. x
The ordinary fucceflion being thus interrupted, the Senate named Appius Claudius, as Interrex, to hold the elections, and at the fame time depriv- ed Lepidus of his command in Gaul. Upon this information he hastened to Italy with the troops he had already assembled, and greatly alarmed the republic. The Senate gave to Appius Claudius, and to Catulus, in the quality of Proconsul, the usual charge to watch over the safety of the State. These officers accordingly, without delay, collec- ted a military force, while Lepidus advanced through Etruria, and published a manifesto, in which he invited all the friends of liberty to join him, and made a formal demand of being re-in- vested with the consular power. In opposition to this treasonable ad of Lepidus, the Senate repu- blifhed the law of Plautius, by which the Prators were required, in the ordinary course of justice, to take cognizance of all attemps to levy war against the republic, and joined to it an addition- al clause or resolution of their own, obliging those magistrates to receive accusations of treason on holy-days, as well as on ordinary days of business.
Mean time Lepidus advanced to the very gates of Rome, seized the Janiculum and one of the bridges. But in his farther attempt to force the city, was met by Catulus, repulsed and routed. All his party dispersed; he himself fled to Sardinia, and soon after died. His son, a young man, with part of
the
C HAP the army, retired to Alba, was there soon after
taken, and suffered for a treason in which he had been engaged by his father.
Marcus Brutus, the father of him who, in the continuation of these troubles, afterwards fell at Philippi, having joined with Lepidus in this rafil and profligate attempt against the republic, was obliged at Mantua to surrender himself to Pom- pey, and, by his order, was put to death. But the most considerable part of the army of Lepidus penetrated, under the conduct of Perperna, into Spain, and joined Sertorius, who was now become the refuge of one party in its diflrefs, as Sylla had formerly been of the other. In this province ac- cordingly, while peace began to be restored in Italy, a source of new troubles was opening for the State. The prevailing party in the city was willing to grant an indemnity, and to susser all prosecution, on account of the late offences, to drop; the extreme to which Sylla had carried the severity of his executions, disposing the minds of men to the opposite course of indulgence and mercy.
Before the arrival of Lepidus with his army in Italy, Mithridates had sent to obtain from the Se- nate a ratification of the treaty he had concluded with Sylla: but, upon a complaint from Ariobar- zanes, that the king of Pontus had not himself performed his part of that treaty by the complete restitution of Cappadocia, he was directed to give full satisfaction on this point before his negotia-
tion
tion at Rome could proceed. He accordingly HAP. complied; but by the time his ambassador had xv. brought the report, the Romans were so much oc- cupied by the war they had to maintain againit Lepidus and his adherents, that they had no lei- sure for concerns so remote. This intelligence en- couraged Mithridates to think of renewing the war. Sensible that he could not rely on a perma- nent peace with the Romans, he had already pro- vided an army, not so conliderable il refped to numbers as that which he had formerly employed against them, but more formidable by the order and discipline he had endeavoured to introduce on the model of their own legion. He flattered him- self, that the diftradion under which the republic now laboured at home, would render it unable to resist his forces in Asia, and give him an oppoatu.- nity to remove the only obstruCtion that remained to his own conquests. He avoided, however, du- ring the dependence of a negotiation, and without the pretext of a new provocation, to break out into open hostilities; but he encouraged his son- in-law Tigranes, king of Armenia, to make war on the Roman allies in his neighbourhood, and thereby laid the foundation of a quarrel which he might either adopt or decline at pleasure. This prince accordingly, being then building a city, under the name of Tigranocerta, for which he wanted inhabitants, made an incursion into the kingdom of Cappadocia, and is said to have cars
ried
c H A P. ried off from thence three hundred thousand of
XV' the people to replenish his new settlement.
Soon after this nfradion of the peace, Mithri- dates, in order to have the co-operation of some of the parties into which the Roman State was di- vided, entered into a treaty with Sertorius, and wished, in concert with this adventurer, to execute the project of a march, by the route which was afterwards frequented by the barbarous nations in their successful attempts to invade and dismember the Empire of Rome. From the ihores of the Euxine it appeared easy to pass over land to the Adriatic, and once more to repeat the operations of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, by making war on the Romans in their own country.
Sertorius, who had ereted the standard of the republic in Spain, gave refuge to the Roman ex- iles from every quarter, and was now at the head of a formidable power, composed of Italians as well as natives of that country. By his birth and abilities he had pretensions to the highest prefer- ments of the State, and had been early distinguish- ed as a soldier, qualified either to plan or to exe- cute. He was attached to Marius in the time of the Cimbric war, and became a party with this leader in his quarrel with Sylla. His animosity to the latter was increased by the mutual oppofi- tion of their interests in the pursuit of civil pre- ferments. At the beginning of the civil war, Ser- torius took an active part, but shewed more re- fpet to the constitution of his country, and more
mercy
mercy to those who were opposed to him, than H A P.
xv. either of his associates Marius or Cinna. When xv , his fation was in possession of the government, he was appointed to command in Spain, and, after the ruin of its affairs in Italy, withdrew into that Province. He was received as a Roman gover- nor; but, soon after, when his enemies had pre- vailed in Italy, was attacked on their part by Caius Annius, who came with a proper force to dislodge him. He had etablifhed posts on the Pyrenees for the security of his province; but the officer to whom they were entrusted being assassinated, and the stations deserted, the enemy had free ac- cess on that fide. Not in condition to maintain himself any longer in Spain, he embarked with what forces he could assemble at Carthagena, and continued for some years, with a small squadron of Cilician galleys, to subsist by the spoils of Africa and the contiguous coasts. In this fRate of his for- tunes, Sertorius formed a project to visit the For- tunate Islands, and if a settlement could be effect- ed there, to bid farewel for ever to the Roman world, with all its factions, its divisions, and its troubles. But while he was about to set fail in search of this famous retreat in the ocean, he re- ceived an invitation from the unfubdued natives of Lusitania to become their leader. At their head his abilities soon made him conspicuous. He affected to confider his new partizans as the Se- nate and People of Rome, treating the cfeablifh- ment of Sylla in Italy as a mere usurpation. He
himfeltf
c HAP. himself took the ensigns of a Roman officer of
v . State, selected three hundred of his followers, to
whom he gave the title of Senate, and, in all his tranfadions with foreign nations assumed the name and style of the Roman Republic. In treating with Mithridates, he refused to cede the province of Asia, or to purchase the alliance of that prince by any concessions injurious to the Roman Em- pire, of which he affected to confider himself and his Senate as the legal head.
While Sertorius was acting this farce, the report of his formidable power, the late acceflion he had gained by the jundion of some of the Marian for- ces under the command of Perperna, and his sup- posed preparations to make a descent upon Italy, gave an alarm at Rome. Metellus had been some time employed against him in Spain; but being scarcely able to keep the field, the opposition he gave tended only to augment the reputation of u. C. 67u. his enemy. The Consuls lately elected were judg- D. Junius Bintus,. ed unequal to this war, and the thoughts of all Mam. Emi- lianus livi- men were turned on Pompey, who, though yet in anus.
no public character, nor arrived at the legal age of State preferments, had the address on this, as on many other occasions, to make himself be pointed at as the only person who could effectually serve the republic. He was accordingly, with the title of Proconsul, joined to Metellus in the conduc of the war in Spain I. It no doubt facilitated the

career of this young man's pretenlions, that few c A. p. men of diflinguifhed abilities were now in the iay to iiftnin the fortunes of the republic. Such perlons, of whatever party, had, in their turns; been the firit vicims of the late violent naffa- cres; and the party of Sylla, w hich was now the tepublic, when confidered as a nursery of eminent men, had lonie diiadvantage, perhaps in the fu- periority of its leader, who was himself equal to all its affairs, and tatught others to confide and obey; iather than to nd for themselves. Pompey was not of an age to have fuiTered from this influence. He came into the party in its bulief tinme, and had been entrutled with separate commands. He had already obtained for himself a cohfiderable mea- sure of that artificial consideration which, though it cannot be ftipported without abilities, often ex- ceeds the degree of merit on which it is founded; and this consideration to the end of his life he continued to augment with muchl attention and many concerted intrigues. His genius, however, for war was real, and was now about to be exer- cifed and improved in the contetl wvith Sertorius, an excellent mailer, whose lesions were rough but inftrudive.
Pompey having made the levies destined for this service, took his' departure from Italy by a new toute, and was the firIf Roman gencral iwho made his way into Spain by the Alps through Gaul aind the Pyrcnnees'. Soon after his arrival, a legion that

ox_. and cut off by the enemy. Sertorius was engaged
in the iiege of Laura. Pompey advanced to re- lieve it. Sertorius, upon his approach, took post on an eminence. Pompey prepared to attack him, and the besieged had hopes of immediate relief. But Sertorius had made his disposition in such a manner, that Pompey cohld not advance without exposing his own rear to a party that was placed to attack him. " I will teach this pupil of Sylla," he said, " to look behind as well as before him ;" and Pompey, feeing his danger, chose to withdraw, leaving the town of Laura to fall into the enemy's hands, while he himself continued a fpe&ator of the iiege, and of the deftrudion of the place. As- ter this unsuccessful beginning of the war, he was obliged to retire into Gaul for the winter r. u. c. 677. The following year, Cn. Odavius and C. Scri- vius c. bonius Curio being Consuls, Pompey till retained S"ribonis his command; and, having repassed the Pyrennees,
directed his march to join Metellus. Sertorius lay on the Sucroz, and wished to engage one or other of these parties before their junCion; and Pompey, on his part, being desirous to reap the glory of a separate vidory, an adion ensued, in which the wing on which Pompey fought was defeated by Sertorius; but the other wing had the victory over Perperna. As Sertorious was about to renew the action on the following day,

he was preventec by the arrival of Metellus. " If c A P.
xV. " the old woman had not interposed," he said, - " I flould have whipt the boy, and sent him back
to his schools at Rome." This war continued about two years longer with various success, but without any memiorable event, until it ended by the death of Sertorius, who, at the instigation of his aifociate Perperna, was betrayed and assassinated by a few of his own attendants. Perperna, having removed Sertorius by this base aftion, put himself at the head of both their adherents, and endeavoured to keep them united, at least until he hould be able to purchase his peace at Rome. He was, however, deserted by numbers of those who had been attached to Sertori- us, and at last surprised by Pompey, and slain. He had made offers to disclose the secrets of the party, and to produce the correspondence which many of the principal citizens at Rome held with Sertorius, inviting him to return into Italy, and promising to join him with a considerable force. The let- ters which had passed in this correspondence were secured by Pompey, and, without being opened, were burned. So masterly an ac of prudence, in a person who was yet confidered as a young man, has been deservedly admired. It served to ex- tinguifh remains of the Marian faction, and recon- ciled men, otherwise difaffeded, to a situation in which they were now assured of impunity and even of concealment.

xv. ' the field, C. Julius Cafar, being about seven years
younger, that is, twenty-three years of age, was returned from Asia.; and, to make some trial of his parts, lodged a complaint against Dolabella, late Proconsul of Macedonia, for oppression and extor- tion in his province. Cotta and Hortenfius, ap- pearing for the defendant, procured his acquittal Cicero fays, that he himself was then returned from a journey he had made into Asia, and was present at this trial. The following year Caesar left. Rome, with intention to pass some time under a celebrated master of rhetoric at Rhodes. In his way he was taken by pirates, and remained their prisoner about forty days, until he found means to procure from Metellus a. fum of fifty talents ', which was paid for his ransom. He had frequent- ly warned the pirates, while yet. in their hands, that he should punish their insolence; and at part- ing, he told them to expect the performance of his promise. Upon being set on shore, he aflem- bled and armed some vessels on the coast, pursued his late captors, took and brought them into port. From thence he hastened to Junius Silanus, the Proconsul of Bythinia, and applied for an order to have them executed; but being refused by this officer, he made his way back with still greater dif- patch, and, before any inftrudions could arrive to the contrary, had his prisoners nailed to the cross. Such lawless banditti had long infested the seas of
Asia- ' Near to L. Ic,c::.
Asia and of Greece, and furnished at times no in- c H A P. considerable employment to the arms of the re- _ public. Servilius Vatia, who afterwards bore the title of Ifauricus, had lately been employed against them; and, after clearing the seas, endeavoured likewise to destroy or to secure their sea-ports and firong-holds on ihore. They, nevertheless, reco- vered from this blow they had received from Ifau- ricus, and continued to appear at intervals in new swarms, to the great interruption of commerce and of all the communications by sea, in the em- pire.
Under the reformations of Sylla, which, by dif- arming the tribunitian power, in a great me: sure shut up the source of former disorders, the repu- rlic was now restored to some degree of tranquil- lity, and resumed its attention to the ordinary as- fairs of peace. The bridge on the Tiber, which had been erected of wood, was taken down and rebuilt with stone; bearing the name of iEmilius, one of the Quaefors under whose inspection the fabric had been reared; and as a public concern of fiill greater importance, it is mentioned, that a treatise on agriculture, the producion of Mago a Carthaginian, and in the language of Carthage, was, by the express orders of the Senate, now tranf- lated into Latin. At the reduction of Carthage, the Romans were yet governed by huibandmen, and, amidst the literary spoils of that city, this book alone, consisting of twenty-eight rolls or vo- lumes, was supposed to merit so much of the pu-
P 3 blic
C H A. blic attention, as to be secured for the State. A
' x. number of persons, ikilled in the Punic language,
together with Silanus, who had principal charge of the business, were now employed in translating it '.
The calm, however, which the republic enjoy- ed under this period of regular government and pacific pursuits, was not altogether undiifurbed. In the Consulate of Cn, Odavius and C. Scribo- nius Curio, the Tribune Licinius made an attempt to recover the former powers of the office. He ventured, in pretence of both the Consuls, to ha- rangue the People, and exhorted them to reaffume their ancient rights. As a circumstance which serves to mark the petulant boldness of these men, it is mentioned that the Consul Odavius, on this occasion, being ill, was muffled up, and covered with a dressing which brought flies in great num- bers about him. The Consuls being placed toge- ther, Curio made a vehement speech, at the close of which, the Tribune called out to Odavius, ( You never can repay your colleague's service of " this day; if he had not been near you, while he " spoke, and beat the air so much with his gefti- " culations, the flies must by this time have eaten " you up ." The sequel is imperfedly known; but the dispute appears to have been carried to a great height, and to have ended in a tumult, in which the Tribune Licinius was killed.
Upon a review of Sylla's ads intended to re- store the authority of the Senate, it may be quef-
tioned, I Plin. lib. xviii. c. Z Cicero de Claris Cratoribu:.
tioned, whether that clause in the law relating to c H A P. the Tribunes, by which all persons having accept- , ed of this office were excluded from any furtherpre- ferment in the State; may not have had an ill effet, and required correction. It rendered the Tribu- nate an object only to the meanest of the Senators, who, upon their acceptance of it, ceasing to have any pretensions to the higher offices of State, were, .by this means, deprived of any interest in the go- vernment, and exasperated of course against the higher dignities of the commonwealth from which they were themselves excluded. Aurelius Cotta, u.c. 678.
L Oda- one of the Consuls that succeeded Cn. Octavius and ,,us, c. Au- Curio, moved perhaps by this consideration, propo-reliusCotta- fed to have that clause repealed, and was warmly supported by the Tribune Opimius, who, contrary to the prohibition lately enacted, ventured to ha- rangue the People; and for this offence, at the expiration of his office, was tried and condemn- ed I.
By the defects which the People began to appre- hend in their present institutions, or by the part which their demagogues began to take against the aristocracy, the Roman State, after a very short re- spite, began to relapse into its former troubles, and was again to exhibit the curious spectacle of a nation divided against itself, broken and diffrated in its councils at home, but viCtorious in all its operations abroad, and gaining continual accessions of empire, under the effect of convulsions which
P 4 shook .'Cicero, 3tio, in Verrem., Pxdianus, ibid,
C. HAPI. 0ook the' commonwealth itself to its base; and,
,V., what is still less to be paralleled in the history of
mankind, exhibiting the fpedacle of a nation, which continued from the earlicet ages to proceed in its aftairs abroad with a ficccfs that may be imputed in a great measure to its divisions at home.
War, in the detail of its operations, if not even in the formation of its plans, is more likely to fuc- ceed under single men than under numerous councils. The Roman constitution, though far from an arrangement proper to preserve domestic peace and tranquillity, was an excellent nursery of Ilatefmien and warriors. To individuals trained in this school, all foreign affairs were committed with little responsibility and less controul. The ruling passion, even of the least virtuous citizens, during some ages, was the ambition of being con- fiderable, and of riling to the highest dignities of the State at home. In the provinces they enjoy- ed the condition of monarchs; but they valued this condition only as it furnished them with the occalion of triumphs, and contributed to their im- portance at Rome. They were factious and tur- bulent in their competition for preferment and honours in the capital; but, in order the better to support that very contest at home, were faithful and inflexible in maintaining all the pretenlions of the State abroad. Thus Sylla, though deprived of his command by an ad of the opposite fation at Rome, and with many of his fiiends, who escape'd from the bloody hands of their perfecu-
tors,
tors, condemned and outlawed, still maintained c HA P.
xV. the part of a Roman officer of state, and pre- fcribed to Mithridates, in the terms which might have been expected from a Roman Magistrate in the molt undiftu'bed exercise of his trust. Ser- torius, in the fame manner, acting for the op- pofite faction, in some measure preserved a similar dignity of character, and on the proposals which were made to him by the fame Prince, refused to make concessions unworthy of the Roman republic. Contrary to the fate of other nations, where the State is weak, while the conduct of individuals is regular; here the State was in vigour, while the conduct of individuals was in the highest degree irregular and wild.
The reputation of the Romans, even in the in- tervals of war, procured them accessions of terri- tory without labour, and without expence. Thus, kingdoms were bequeathed to them by will; as that of Pergamus formerly by the testament of Attalus; that of Cyrene, at the bequest of Ptolomy Appion; and that of Bithynia, about this time, by the will of Nicomedes. To the fame effedc, princes and states, where they did not make any formal cession of their sovereignty, did somewhat equivalent, by submitting their rights co discussion at Rome, and by soliciting from the Romans, grants of which the world now seemed to acknowledge the vali- dity, by having recourse to them as the bais of tenures by which they were to hold their poflef- pns. To the fame effect alto, the sons of the last
Antiochus,
c H A P. Antiochus, king of Syria, having pafled two years
,at Rome, waiting decisions of the Senate, and so- liciting a grant of the kingdom of Egypt, on which they formed their opposite pretensions, thus stated themselves as fubjeas or dependents on the republic of Rome.
In Asia, by these means, the Roman empire ad- vanced on the ruin of those who had formerly op- posed its progress. The Macedonian line, in the monarchy of Syria, was now broken off, or extint. The monarchy itself was no more. For on the defeat of Antiochus at Sipylus, followed by the defection of provincial governors and tributary princes, who, no longer awed by the power of their former mafler, entered into a correspondence with the Romans, and were by them acknowledg- ed as sovereigns, the empire of Syria, once so en- tire, was split and dismembered. In this manner also the Itates of Armenia, long subjed to the Per- sians, and afterwards to the Macedonians, now be- came the feat of a new monarchy under Tigranes. And, to complete these revolutions of empire, the natives of the last diftridt to which the name of Syria was affixed, weary of the degeneracy and weakness of their own court, of the irregularity of the succession to the throne of their own kingdom; weary of the frequent competitions which involv- ed them in blood, invited Tigranes the king of Armenia to wield a sceptre which the descendants of Seleucus were no longer in condition to hold. This prince, accordingly, extended his kingdom to
both
both fides of the Euphrates, and held the remains H A P. of Assyria itself as one of its divisions . ,x
In these circumstances, the Romans were left undisturbed to re-eftablifl their province in the Lesser Asia: and under the auspices of Servilius, who, from his principal acquisition in those parts, had the name of Ifauricus, were extending their limits on the fide of Cilicia, and were hastening to the sovereignty of that coast, when their pro- grefs was suddenly checked by the re-appearance of an enemy, who had already given them much trouble in the eastern part of the empire.
Mithridates, king of Pontus, who appears to have revived in his own breast the animofities of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal against the Romans, had never ceased, since the date of his last mortifying treaty with Sylla, to devise the means of renewing the war. Having attempted in vain to engage Sylla in a league with himself against the Romans, he made a similar attempt on Sertorius, to which we have already referred. Affeding to confider this fugitive, with his little Senate, as head of the republic, he pressed for a cession of the Roman province in Alia in his own favour, and in return offered to aflift the followers of Sertorius with all his forces in the recovery of Italy. In this ne- gotiation, however, he found, as has been already remarked, that whoever assumed the character of a Roman officer of slate, supported it with a like inflexible dignity. Sertorius refused to difiember the empire, but accepted of the proffered aid from
Mithridates, X Strabo, lib. xi. fine.
CHAP. Mithridates, and agreed to supply him with of-
XV' ficers of the Roman eflablifhment to assist in the
formation and discipline of his troops.
The king of Pontus, now bent on correcting the error which is common in extensive and barbarous monarchies, of relying entirely on numbers, with less attention to discipline or military skill, proposed to form a more regular army than that which he had assembled in the former war; and, however little successful in his attempts, he endeavoured to rival his enemy in every particular of their discipline, in the choice and use of their weapons, and in the form of their legion. With troops beginning to make these reformations, and amounting to one hundred and twenty thousand foot, and sixteen thousand horse, he made an open declaration of war, and, without resistance, took possession of Cap- padocia and Phrygia, beyond the bounds which the Romans had prescribed to his kingdom. As he was to ad both by sea and by land, he began with customary oblations to Neptune and to Mars. To the first he made an offering of a splendid car- riage, drawn by white horses, which he precipi- tated from a cliff, and funk in the sea; to .the o- ther he made a sacrifice, which, as described by the historian1, filled the imagination more than any of the rites usually practised by ancient na- tions. The king, with his army, ascended the highest mountain on their route, formed on its summit a great pile of wood, of which he himself
laid 1 Appian

As soon as it was finifll- ed, the army around it began the solemnity with a feast, at the end of which the pile was set on fire, and in proportion as the heat increased, the hofR extended its circle, and came down from the mountain. The smoke and the flames continued to ascend for many days, and were seen, it is said, at the distance of a thousand fladia, or above an' hundred miles '.
After this solemnity was over, Mithridates en- deavoured to animate and to unite in a common zeal for his cause the different nations which, in forming his army, had been collected from the most distant parts of the empire. For this pur- pose he enumerated the successes by which he him- self had raised his kingdom. to its present pitch of greatness, and represented the numerous vices or defeds of the enemy with whom he was now to contend, reciting their divisions at home, their op- pression abroad, their avarice, and their infatiablc luff of dominion.
The Romans were some time undetermined in the choice of a person to be employed against this formidable enemy. Pompey, being still in Spain, saw with regret a service of this importance likely to fall to the ihare of another; and he had his partizans at Rome who would have ladly piut off

.XY until he himself could arrive wyith his army to
receive it. He had about this time, impatient of his absence from Rome, wrote a letter to the Senate, complaining, in petulant terms, of their neglec, and of the traits to which the troops un- der his command were reduced for want of pay and provisions, and threatening, if not speedily supplied, to fall back upon Italy. The Consul Lucullus, apprehending what might be the confe- quence of Pompey's arrival, with a military force, and wishing not to furnifl him with any pre- tence for leaving his province, had the army in Spain completely supplied, and, at the fame time, took proper measures to support his own preten- lions to the command in Asia. From his rank as Consul in office, he had a natural claim to this fta- tion; and from his knowledge of the country, and of the war ' with this very enemy, in which he had already borne some part under Sylla , he was
well x Vide Ciceronis in Lucullo, c. r et 2. 2 Plutarch. in Lucull. initio. Edit.

It is observed by Lord Bo- lingbroke, that Cicero, who, among his other pretensions to fame, aspired to that of a military commander, had an interest in having it believed, that great officers might be formed in this manner: But as he could not be ignorant that Luctlllus had acled under Sylla, it is probable, that he affeded to confidcr the part which was assigned to him by Sylla, as a mere civil employment. He is indeed mentioned as having charge of the coinage with which Sylla paid his army, and of the fleet with which he transported them into Asia : but it is not to be supposed, that there were the only operations confided by Sylla to a lieutenant of so much ability.

When the provinces came to be difiributed, the difficulties which presented themselves in Alia were thought to require the presence of both the Con- fuls. The kingdom of Bythinia, which had been lately bequeathed to the Romans, was in danger of being invaded before they could obtain a for- mal poifeffion of this inheritance; at the fame time that the enemy, by whom they were threat- ened, was not likely to limit his operations to the attack of that country. Of the Consuls, Cotta was appointed to seize on the kingdom of Bythi- nia, and Lucullus to lead the army againit Mithri- dates wherever else he should carry the war. Cot- ta set out immediately for his province. Lucullus, being detained in making the necessary levies, fol- lowed some time afterwards; but before his arri- val in Asia, Cotta had been obliged to evacuate Bythinia, and to take refuge in Chalcedonia. The king of Pontus, being superior both by sea and by land, had over-run the country in the neighbour- hood of this place; and, having broke the chain which shut up the mouth of the harbour, entered and burnt some Roman gallies, which were flation- ed there. Not thinking it advisable to attack the town of Chalcedonia, he turned his forces againil Cyzicus, a port on the Propontis, and blocked up the place both by ifa and by land; being well- provided with battering engines, and the other ne- ccfarics of a siege, he had lhocp of being soon
aible
CHAP. able to reduce it by ftorn. The inhabitants, nec sj , verthelefs, were prepared to refit, and were in ex-
pectation of being speedily relieved by the Romans.
Such was the state of affairs when Lucullus ar- rived in Asia; and having joined his new levies to the legions which had served under Fimbria, and to the other troops already in the province, he as- fembled an army of about thirty thousand men, with which he advanced to re-establish Cotta in his province, and to relieve the town of Cyzicus.
Mithridates being elated by his own fiucceffes, and by the fuperioritv of his numbers, did not sus- ficiently attend to the motions of Lucullus, suffered him to get possession of the heights in his rear, and to cut off his principal supplies of provisions and forage. Trusting, however, that his magazines would not be exhausted before he should have for- ced the town of Cyzicus to surrender, he continued the siege. But his engines not being well served, and the defence being obflinate, his army began to be distressed for want of provisions, and it became neceifary to lessen his consumption. For this pur- pose he secretly detached some part of his cavalry, which being intercepted by the Romans on their march, were cut off or dispersed; and the king, now feeing the remainder of his troops unable to' subsist any longer in their present situation, em- barked on board one of his gallies, ordered the army to force their way to Lampfacus, while lie himself endeavoured to escape with his fleet. In this retreat, being harraffed by Lucullus, the great-
er
er part of the late befigers of Cyzicus perified in C I A p. passing the Afopus and the GrannicLis. The king X himself, having put into Nicomedia, and fioin ,thence continuing his voyage thrqugh the Boipho- rus to the Eixine, was overtaken on that tea by a .storm, and loft the greatest part of his filipping. His own galley being funk, he himlcif narro,,-y escaped in a barge.
The whole force with which the king of Pon- tus had invaded Bythinia, being thus dispelled like a cloud, Lucullus employed some time in reducig .the towns into which any of the troops of Mi- thridates had been received; and having effectual- ly destroyed the remains of the vanquiihed army, took his route by Bythinia and Galatia towards Pontus. At the entrance into this kingdom was situate the town of Amyfus, a considerable fortress on the coast of the Euxine, into which had been thrown a sufficient force to retard the progress of an enemy. Mithridates, under favour of the de- lays;obtained by the defence of this place, as- enibled a new army at Cabira, near the frontier of Armenia. Here he mustered about forty thousand foot, and a considerable body of horse, and was soliciting the Scythians, Armenians, and all the nations of that continent to his aid.
Lucullus, in order to prevent, if possible, any further reinforcemcnts to the enemy, committed the flege of Amyfu, to M:.rena, and advanced with his army into the plains of Cabira. On this ground the Roman horse received repeated checks from those of the enemy, and we:e kept in continual

c H A P. alarm until their general, having time to observe
xv the country, avoided the plains on which the king
of Pontus, by means of his cavalry, was greatly superior. In pursuit of this plan, though very much straitened for provisions, Lucullus kept his polition on the heights, until the enemy could be attacked with advantage. the ikirmifhes which happened between the foraging parties, brought into acion considerable numbers from the refpec- tive armies; and the troops of Mithridates, having been routed in one of there partial encounters, the king took a resolution to decamp in the night, and remove to a gre~;ter distance from his enemy. As soon as it was dark, the equipage and the attend- ants of the leading men in the camp, to whom he had communicated this resolution, began to with- draw; and the army, greatly alarmed with that appearance, was seized with a panic, and could not be restrained from flight. Horse and foot, and bodies of every description crowded in dif- order into the outlets from the camp, and were trod under foot, or in great numbers perished by each other's hands. Mithridates himself, endea- vouring to flop and to undeceive them, was car- ried off as by the torrent, which could not be withifood.
The noise of this tumult being heard to a great distance, and the occasion being known in the Roman camp, Lucullus advanced with his army to profit by the confusion into which the ene- my were fallen, and by a vigorous attack, ha-
ving
ving put many to the sword, hastened their total c I A P. rout and difperfion.xv
The king himself was, by one of his servants, with difficulty mounted on horseback, and must have been taken, if the pursuing party had not been amused in seizing some plunder, which he had ordered on purpose to be left in their way. A mule, loaded with some part of the royal trea- sure, turned the attention of his pursuers, while he himself made his escape.
In his flight the king appeared to be most as- feded with the fate of his women. The greatest number of them were left at the palace of Phar- nacea, a place that must soon fall into the hands of the enemy. He therefore dispatched a faithful eunuch with orders to put them to death, leaving the choice of the manner to themselves. A few are particularly mentioned. Of two, who were his own fiters, Roxana and Statira, one died ut- tering execrations against her brother's cruelty, the other extolling, in that extremity of his own fortune, the generous care he took of their honour. Monime, a Greek of Miletus, celebrated for her beauty, whom the king had long wooed in vain with proffers of great riches, and whom he won at last only by the participation of his crown, and the earnest of the nuptial rites, had ever lamented her fortune, which, instead of a royal husband and a palace, had given her a prison, and a barbarous keeper. Being now told, that fle must die, but: that the manner of her death was left to her own

Berenice of Chios, another Grae- cian beauty, had likewise been honoured with the nuptial crown, and, having been attended in her state of melancholy elevation by her mother, who, on this occasion, likewise resolved to partake of her daughter's fate; they chose to die by poison. The mother intreated that she might have the first draught; and died before her daughter. The re- mainder of the dose not being sufficient for the queen, she put herself likewise into the hands of the executioner, and was fWrangled. By these deaths, the barbarous jealousy of the king was gratified, and the future triumph of the Roman general de- prived of its principal ornaments.
Lucullus, after his victory, having no enemy in the field to oppose him, overran the country, and passed without interruption through most of the towns in the kingdom of Pontus. He found many palaces enriched with treasure, and adorned with barbarous magnificence; and, as might be ex- peded under such a violent and difiruilful govern- inent, every where places of confinement crowded with prisoners of trate, whom the jealousy of the king had secured, and whom his supercilious ne- glect had suffered to remain in custody, even as- ter his jcalo.fy wras allayed.

Mithridates, from his late defeat, fled into Ar- c H A P. menia, and claimed the protection of Tigranes, xv who, being married to his daughter, had already favoured him in his designs against the Romans.
This powerful prince, now become sovereign of Syria as well as Armenia, still continued his re- fidence in the last of these kingdoms at Tigrano- certa, a city he himself had built, flocked with in- habitants, and distinguished by his own name. On the arrival of Mithridates to sue for his protection, Tigranes declined to fee him, but ordered him a princely reception in one of the palaces.
Lucullus continued his pursuit of this flying ene- my only to the frontier of Armenia, and from thence, fending Publius Clodius, who was his bro- ther-in-law, to the court of Tigranes, with in- firudions to require that Mithridates ihould be delivered up as a lawful prey, he himself fell back into the kingdom of Pontus, and soon after redu- ced Amyfus, together with Sinopi, and other pla- ces of strength, which were held by the troops of the king.
The inhabitants of these places had been origi- nally colonies from Greece, and having been sub- dued by the Persians, were, on the arrival of Alex- ander the Great, from refpeta to their origin, re- fiored to their freedom. In imitation of this ex- ample, and agreeably to the profession which the Romans ever made of protedting the liberties of Greece, Lucullus once more declared those cities to be free.

cient leisure to attend to the general itate of the Ro- man affairs that were committed to his government, found the following particulars from which we may collec the measure of abuse to which the conquered provinces were exposed. The collectors of reve- nue, under pretext of levying the tax imposed by Sylla, had been guilty of the greatest oppreflions. The inhabitants, in order to pay this tax, borrow- ed money of the Roman officers and merchants at exorbitant interest ; and, when they no longer had any credit, their effects were distrained for pay- ment, or themselves threatened with imprisonment and tortures: private persons were reduced to the necessity of exposing their children to sale, and cor- porations of felling the pictures, images, and other ornaments of their temples, in order to satisfy these inhuman creditors. Willing to restrain, or to cor- rect these abuses, Lucullus ordained, that where the fumn exacted for usury was equal to the capi- tal, the.debt should be cancelled; and in other ca- fes, fixed the interest at a moderate rate. These adts of beneficence or justice to the provinces were, by the farmers of the revenue, represented as ats of oppression and cruelty to themselves, and were, among their connections, and the fiharers of their profits at Rome, stated against Lucullus-as fubjeds of complaint and reproach.

It was at first in- troduced as a species of human sacrifice at fune- rals, and such viCtims were now kept by the weal-
Q 4 ' thy
C H P. thy in great numbers for the entertainment of the
I._ public, and even for private amusement. The
handsomest, the most active, and the boldest of the slaves or captives were feleded for this purpose. They were sworn to decline no combat, and to {tlun no hardlhip, to which they were exposed by their mailers; they were of different denomina- tions, and accustomed to fight in different ways; but those from whom the whole received their de- fignation, employed the fxvord and buckler, or target; and they commonly fought naked, that the place and nature of the wounds they received might the more plainly appear.
Even in this proflituttion of valour, refinements of honour were introduced. There were certain gra- ces of attitude which the gladiator was not per- mitted to quit, even to avoid a wound. There was a manner wvhich 'he studied to preserve in his fall, in his bleeding posture, and even in his death. He was applauded, or hissed, according as he fuc- ceeded or failed in any of these particulars. When, after a tedious struggle, lhe was spent with labour and with the loss of blood, he still endeavoured to preserve the dignity of his character, dropt or re- fumed the sword at his master's pleasure, and look.- ed round to the fpedators- for marks of their satis- faction and applause '.
Perobns of every age, condition, and sex, attend- ed at these exhibitions; and when the pair who were engaged began to Itrain and to bleed, the

fpe&ators, being divided in their inclinations, en- c H A P. deavoured to excite, by their cries and acclama- .',.. tions, the party they favoured; and when the con- test was ended, called to the victor to .strike, or to spare, according as the vanquished was supposed to have forfeited or to have deserved his life . With fpedacles of this fort, which must create so much disgust and horror in the recital, the Ro- mans were more intoxicated than any populace in modern Europe now are with the baiting of bulls, or the running of horses, probably because they were more deeply affeded, and more intensely moved by the scene.
Spartacus, a Thracian captive, who, on account of his strength and activity, had been destined for this barbarous profeifion, with about seventy or eighty of his companions, having escaped from their place of confinement, armed themselves with such weapons as accident presented to them, and reti- ring to some fastness on the ascents of Vesuvius, from thence harafled the country with robberies and murders. " If we are to fight," laid the leader of this desperate band, " let us fight against our "oppressors, and in behalf of our own liberties,
not to make sport for this petulant and cruel "race of men." Multitudes of flares from every quarter flocked to his standard. The Prefec of Capua turned out the inhabitants of his diftric? against them, but was defeated.

CH AP. the insurrection, furnished the rebels with arms,
x.x . and raised their reputation and their courage.
Their leader, by his generosity in rejecting his own share of any booty he made by his conduct and his valour, acquired the authority of a legal commander; and, having named Crixus and Oe- nomaus, two other gladiators, for his Subordinate officers, he formed the multitudes that retorted to him into regular bodies, employed a certain num- ber to fabricate arms. and to procure the neceflary accommodations of a camp, till at length he col- leted an army of seventy thousand men, with which he commanded the country to a great ex- tent. He had already fucceflively defeated the Praetors Clodius, Varinus, and Coffinius, who had been sent againit him with considerable forces, so that it became neceifary to order proper levies, and to give to the Consuls the charge of repressing this formidable enemy.
Spartacus had too much prudence to think him- self fit to contend with the force of the Roman State, which he perceived must soon be assembled against him. He contented himself, therefore, with a more rational scheme of conducting his ar- my by the ridge of the Appenines, till he fholdd gain the Alps, from whence his followers, whether Gauls, Germans, or Thracians, might separate, each into the country of which he was a native, or from which he had been brought into the state of bondage, from which they now endeavoured to extricate themselves.
While
While he began his progress by the mountains, c 1 A P.
XVI. in order to execute this project, the Consuls, Gel-. ' v lius and Lentulus, had already taken the field a- U. C. 6,8"

But Lentulus afterwards pressing hard upon Spartacus, who led the main body of the rebels, brought on an adtion, in which the confu- lar army was defeated with considerable loss. Caf- fius too, the Praetor of Cisalpine Gaul, having ad- vanced upon him with an army of ten thousand men, was repulsed with great fliughter.
In consequence of these advantages, Spartacus might no doubt have effeced his retreat to the Alps; but his army being elated with vitory, * and confidering themselves as masters of Italy,
were unwilling to abandon their conquest. He himself formed a new projeEt of marching to Rome; and for this purpose destroyed all his fu- perfluous baggage and cattle, put his captives to death, and refused to receive any more of the ·slaves, who were still in multitudes resorting to his itandard. He probably expedted to elude or to pass the Roman armies without a battle, and to force the city of Rome itself by an unexpeced as- fault. In this he was disappointed by the Con- fuls, with whom he was obliged to fight in the Picenum ; and, though victorious in the adcion, he loft hopes of surprising the city. But still thinking himself in condition to keep his ground
in
C IHAP. in Italy, he only altered his route, and direced xV'. his march towards Lucania.
The Romans, greatly embarrassed, and thrown into some degree of consternation, by the unex- peaed continuance of an infurredion which had given them much trouble, and which exposed their armies to much danger, with little profped of honour; not being courted, as usual, for the command in this service, they imposed rather than conferred it on Marcus Crassus, then in the rank of Praetor, and conlidered as a person of consequence, more on account of his wealth than of his abili- ties; though in this service, after others had fail- ed, he laid the foundation of a more favourable judgment. They at the fame time sent orders to Pompey, who had finished the war in Spain, to halten into Italy with his army; and to the Pro- consul of Macedonia, to embark with what forces could be spared from his province.
Crassus assembled no less than fix legions, with which he joined the army which had been already so unsuccessful against the revolt. Of the troops who had miscarried, he is said to have executed, perhaps only decimated, four thousand, as an ex- ample to the new levies, and as a warning of the severities they were to exped for any failure in the remaining part of the service.
Upon his arrival in Lucania he cut off ten thou- sand of the rebels, who were flationed at a dif- tance from the main body of their army, and he endeavoured to shut up Spartacus in the penzinfiia
' .
of Brutium, or head of land which extends to the c H A P. Straits of Messina. The gladiators desired to pass XV1 into Sicily, where their fellow-fufferers, the slaves of that island, were not yet entirely subdued, and where great numbers at all times were prepared to revolt: but they were prevented by the want of shipping. Crassus at the fame time undertook a work of great labour, that of intrenching the land from sea to sea with a ditch fifteen feet wide, and as many deep, extending, according to Plu- tarch, three hundred stadia, or above thirty miles. Spartacus endeavouring to interrupt the execu- tion of this work, was frequently repulsed; and his followers beginning to despond, entertained thoughts of surrender. But in order to supply by despair what they loft in courage, he put them in mind that they fought not upon equal terms with their enemies; that they must either conquer or be treated as fugitive slaves; and, to enforce his admonitions, he ordered one of his captives to be nailed to the cross in light of both armies. " This," he said to his own people, " is "an example of what you are to susser if you
fall into the enemy's hands." Whilst Crassus was busy completing his line of countervallation, Spartacus prepared to force it; and, having provided faggots and other materials for this purpose, filled up theditch at a convenient place, and passed it in the night with the whole body of his followers. Diretiing his flight to
Apulia,
c HA P. Apulia, he was pursued, and greatly harassed in
Xv. X__.* his march.
Accounts being received at once in the camp of Crassus and in that of Spartacus, that fresh troops -were landed at Brundulium from Macedonia, and that Pompey was arrived in Italy, and on his march to join Crassus, both armies were equally disposed to hazard a battle; the gladiators, that they might not be attacked at once by so many ene- mies as were collecing against them; and the Ro- mans under Crassus, that Pompey might not arrive to fiatch out of their hands the glory of terminating the war. Under the influence of there different motives, both leaders drew forth their armies; and when they were ready to engage, Spartacus, with the valour rather of a gladiator than of a ge- neral, alighting from his horse, and faying aloud, in the hearing of his followers, " If I conquer to- " day, I Ihall be better mounted; if not, I shall " not have occasion for a horse," he plunged his fwrord into the body of the animal. With this carneft of a resolution to conquer or to die, he ad- vanced towards the enemy; directing the division in which he himself commanded to make their attack where he underifood the Roman general -c:s poled. He intended to decide the adtion by forcing the Romans in that quarter; but after much bloodshed, being mangled with wounds, and still almost alone in the midst of his enemies, he continued to ight til'lc: was .ill d; and the vic- tory of courft declared fJr his enemy. About a
thousand
thousand of the Romans were flail; of .the van- c HA P. quifled the greatest slaughter, as usual in ancient XVI battles, took place after the flight began. The dead were not numbered; about fix thousand were taken, and, in the manner of executing the fen- tence of death on slaves, they were nailed to the cross in rows, that almost lined the way from Ca- pua to Rome. Such as escaped from the field of battle, being about five thousand, fell into the hands of Pompey, and furnished a pretence to his flatterers for ascribing to him the honour of termi- nating the war.
The mean quality of the enemy however, in the present cafe, precluded even Crassus from the ho- nour of a triumph; he could have only an ovation or military. procession on foot. But instead of the myrtle wreath, usual on such occasions, he had credit enough with the Senate to obtain the laurel crown '.
Pompey too arrived at the fame time in the city with new and uncommon pretensions, requiring a dispensation from the law and eftabliflled forms of the commonwealth. The service he had conducted in Spain being of the nature of a civil war of Ro- man citizens against one another, or against sub- jects of the empire, with a Roman general at their head, did not give a regular claim to a triumph: The vidor himself was yet under the legal age, and had not paifed through any of the previous teps of Questor, iEdile and Praetor; yet on the
present z Ad. Gellius, lib. v.
C H A . present occasion he not only insisted on a triumph,
. but put in his claim likewise to an immediate no- mination to the office of Consul.
It now became extremely evident, that the es- tablified honours of the State, conferred in the usual way, were not adequate to the pretensions of this young man: that' he must have new and singular appointments, or those already known beltowed on him in some new and singular man- ner. His enemies observed, that he avoided every occasion of fair competition with his fellow citi- zens; that he took a rank of importance to himself, which he did not submit to have examined; and that he ever aspired to an eminence in which he might Rtand alone, or in the firfi place of public consideration and honour. His partizans, on the contrary, flated the extraordinary favours bestowed on him, as the foundation of still farther diftinc- tions'. In enumerating his services upon his re- turn from Spain, they reckoned up, according to Pliny, eight hundred and feventy-one towns, from the Pyrennees to the extremities of that country, which he had reduced; observed that he had fur- passed the glory of all the officers who had gone before him in that service; and, in consequence of there representations, though still in a private flation, he was admitted to a triumph, or partook \with Metellus in this honour.
Pompey had hitherto, in all the late disputes, raken part with the aristocracy ; but not without
suspicion id. Cicer. pio Lege MIaniliA,
suspicion of aiming too high for republican go- CHAP.
XVL vernment of any fort. While he supported the. Senate, he affected a kind of diftinscion fupe- rior to those who composed it, and was not con- tent with equality, even among the first ranks of his country. He acquiesced, nevertheless, in the mere ihew of importance, and did not insist on- prerogatives which might have engaged him in contefis, and exposed his pretensions to too near an inspection. Upon his approach at the head of an army from Spain, the Senate was greatly alarm- ed; but he gave the most unfeigned assurances of his intention to disband his army as soon as they ihould have attended his triumph. The Senate accordingly gave way to this irregular pretention, and afterwards to the pretension, fill more dan- gerous, which, without any of the previous condi- tions which the law required, he made to the Con- u. c. 683. fulate. Crassus, who having been Praetor in the crat.' preceding year, now stood for the fame office, en- MrnLlP. tered into a concert with Pompey, by which not- withstanding their mutual jealousy of each other, they joined their interests, and were eleCcd to- gether.
Under the administration of there officers some important laws are said to have pafled, although most of the particulars have escaped the notice of those from whom our accounts are taken. It appears that Pompey now began to pay his court to the popular faion; and, though he professed to support the authority of the Senate, wished to have
VOL, II. R it
c u A P. it in his power, on occasion, to take the sense of -~ l what was called the aflembly of the People against
them, or, in other words, to counterad them by means of the popular tumults which bore this name.
The Tribunes, Quindius and Palicanus, had for two years successively laboured to remove the bars which had, by the conititution of Sylla, been opposed to the abuses of the tribunitian power. They had been strenuously resifted by Lucullus and others, who held the office of Consul, during the dependence of the questions which had arisen on that fubjedt. By the favour of Pompey and CraIfus, however, the Tribunes obtained a relti- tution of the privileges which their predecessors, in former times of the republic, had to often abused; and, together with the security of their sacred and inviolable charadcer, and their negative in all pro- ceedings of the State, they were again permitted to propose laws, and to harangue the people; a dangerous measure, by which Pompey at once ren- dered fruitless that reformation which was the 'only apology for the blood so lavishly shed, not only by Sylla, but likewise by himself. Caius Ju- lius Caesar, at the fame time, having the rank of Legionary Tribune conferred upon him by the public choice, was extremely active in procu- ring those popular ads; a policy in which he was more confilent with himself than Pompey, and only pursued the course of that party with which he had been associated in his earliest years'.
Under Sueoni!:s in C. Tul. Caiar. lib. .
Under this Consulate, and probably with the CHAP.
XVI. encouragement of Pompey, the law of Sylla, re- . speding the judicatures, was, upon the motion of the Prator, Aurelius Cotta, likewise repealed; and it was permitted to the Pr3etors to draught the judges in equal numbers from the Senate, the Lex Aure-- Knights, and a certain class of the People ', whose aria. description is not clearly ascertained. This was, perhaps, a just correcion of Sylla's partiality to the Nobles; and, if it had not been accompanied by the former ad, which restored to the Tribunes powers which they had so often abused, might have merited applause.
In the mean time, corruption spread with a haftl pace; among the lower ranks, in contempt of go- vernment; among the higher, in covetousness and prodigality, with an ardour for lucrative appoint- ments, and the opportunity of extortion in the provinces. As the offices of State at Rome began to be coveted with a view to the employments abroad, to which they conducted, Pompey, in or- der to display his own disinterestedness, with an oblique reproof to the Nobility who aspired to magistracy with such mercenary views, took a for- mal oath in entering on his Consulate, that he would not, at the expiration of his office, accept of any government in the provinces; by this ex- ample of generosity in himself, and by the censure it implied of others, he obtained great credit with the People, and furnished his emiflaries, who w-se
R 2 evet. : Tribui;i Erarii.
c T P. ever busy in founding his praise, with a pretence XvI.
t . for enhancing his merit. It may, however, from
his character and policy in other instances, be fu- fpeted, that he remained at Rome with intention to watch opportunities of raising his own confider- ation, and of obtaining, by the strength of his party, any extraordinary trust or commiflion of which the occasion should arise.
This adventurer, in the administration of his Consulate, had procured the revival of the Censors functions. These had been intermitted about sixteen years, during great part of which time the republic had been in a slate of civil war; and the prevail- ing parties, in their turns, mutually had recourse to adts of banifhmernt, confiscations, and military ex- ecutions against each other. In such times, even after the fw-eord was sheathcd, the power of Cen- for, in the first heat of party-refentment, could not be safely entrutted with any of the citizens; and the attempts hllich were now made to revive it, though in appearance successful, could not give it a permanent footing in the commonwealth. The public was arrived at a state in which men complain of evils, but cannot endure their reme- dies.
L. Gellius Poplicola and Cn. Cornelius Ientu- 1us, being entruiled, in the charaCter of Censors, with the making up of thc.rolls of the People, muflered four hundred and fifty thousand citizens.
''hey purged the Senate with great severity, hav- Il g eC-unged fixty-four from the number, and 7mong thei, C. Antonius, afterwards Consul, assign-
ing
ing as their reason, that he, having the command c H A P. on the coaits of Asia and Greece, had pillaged the X__, allies, and mortgaged and fquandcred his own. estate. But what most diftinguihed this Censor- ihip was an incident, for the fake of which, it is likely, the folcmnity of the Ccnfus had been now revived.
It was customary on such occasions for the Knights to pass in review, each leading his horcf before the Censors. They were quefRioned refped- ing their age, the number of their campaigns, and the petfons under whole command they had fcrved; and if they had been already on the military lift the ten years preicribed by law, they received an exemption for the future, and vere veited with the privileges which were annexed to this cir- cumftance. At this part of the ceremony the People where surprised to fee their Consul, Pompey tile Great, descending into the market-place, lead- ing his horse in quality of a simple Knight, but dressed in his consular robes, and preceded by the Lidors. Being quefioned by the Ccnfor, wrhethl. he had served the lated number of years, he in-. fwered that he had, and all of them in armie; commanded by himself. This farce was received with loud acclamations of the People; and the Censors having granted the customary exemption, rose from their feats, and, followed by a great multitude of the People, attended this equestrian Confil to his own Ihoelbc T.

c H A P. It is observed that Crafius and Fompey, although
xv . they entered on office in concert, yet differed in
the course of their administration on fubjeds which aie not particularly mentioned. As Craf- sus was in poiReflion of great wealth, he endea- voured, by his liberalities, to vie with the imposing state and popular arts of his colleague. In this view he gave a public entertainment at ten thou- sand tables, and distributed three months provision of corn to the more indigent citizens. To account for his being able to court the People in so sump- tuous a manner, it is said, that having inherited from his father a fortune of three hundred ta- lents, or near sixty thousand pounds; he increased it, by purchasing at a low price the estates of those who were proscribed in the late troubles, and by letting for hire the labour of a numerous family of slaves, initrucded in various arts and callings; and by these means was become so rich, that when, some time after this date, he was about to depart for Asia, and con'ecrated the tenth part of his estate to Herculus, he was found to possess seven thousand one hundred talents, or about one million three hundred and seventy thousand and three hundred pounds Sterling 2.
Pompey, at the expiration of his year in the Consulship, agreeably to the oath he had taken, re- mained at Rome in a private station; but, fill unchanged in his manner, maintained the reserve
and ' z Plutarch. in Craffo. As the interest of money was prohibited at Rome, under the denomination of usury being clandeflinc, was in fact unlimited, tle annual returns from such a capital must have been imnmenfe.
and stateliness of a person raised above the con- c HA P. dition of a mere citizen, or even above that of the xvI. first Senators of consular rank. Other candidates for consideration and public honours endeavoured, by their talents and eloquence, to make themselves necessary to those who had affairs to solicit with the public, or even to make themselves feared by those who were obnoxious to the law. They laboured to diftinguifl themselves as able advo- cates or formidable accusers at the bar, and to strengthen their interest by procuring the support of those to whom their talents either were or might become of importance. Pompey, on the contrary, flating himself as an exception to com- mon rules, avoided the courts of justice and other places of ordinary resort, did not commit his ta- lents to the public judgment, nor present his per- son to the public view; took the refpea that was paid to him as a right; seldom went abroad, and never without a numerous train of attendants. He was formed for the fiate of a prince, and might have stolen into that high Rfation even at Rome, if men, born to equality, could have suffered an elevation which no measure of personal merit could at once have procured; or had been willing, when troubled with faction, to forego their own im- portance, in order to obtain peace and the comn- forts of a moderate government. The pretensions of Pompey, however, were extremely disagreeable to the Senate, and not otherwise acceptable, even
R4 to i Platarcb. in Vit. Pomp.
c HA P. to the People, than as they tended to mortify the
Xvi. pride of that order of men. U. C. 654. The Consulate of Crassus and Pompey was fuc- Q.Horten- fius, C ceeded by that of Q. Hortenfius and Q. Cacilius creticus Metellus. In the distribution of provinces, Crete,
with the command of an armament to be sent into that island, fell to the lot of Hortenfius; but this citizen, having acquired his consideration by his eloquence in pleading the causes of his friends, and being accustomed to the bar, perhaps in a degree that interfered with the ordinary military character of a Roman officer of State, declined to accept of this government; leaving it, together with the command of the army that was to be employed in the reduEtion of the iftand, to his colleague Metellus, who afterwards received the appellation of Creticus, from the diftination he acquired in this service.
The Cretans, and most of the other seafaring people on the confines of Asia and Europe, had in the late war taken an active part against the Ro- mans. They had, by the influence of Mithri- dates, and by their own disposition to rapine and piracy, been led to prey upon the traders, and upon the carriers of revenue who were frequent- ly pafling to Rome from the provinces. The de- lire of sharing in the profits that were made by this species of war, had filled the lea with pirates and freebooters, against whom the Senate had em- ployed a succession of officers, with extensive com- mands, on the coafss both of Asia and Europe.
Among
Among others, M. Antonius had been sent on this c A P. service, and was accused of abusing his power, by xv_. oppressing the Sicilians, and the people of other maritime provinces, who were innocent of the crimes he was charged to repress. In a defeent on the island of Crete he was defeated and killed 1' and left the Romans engaged with the people of that island in a war which was thought to require the presence of one of the Consuls. And the lot, as has been observed, having fallen on Hortenfius, was transferred to his colleague Metellus.
Such was the state of affairs, and such the defti- u. c. 65.
L. Ca:. nation of the Roman officers, when Lucullus re- Melteus, ceived from Tigranes a return to the demand which "'Iar. he made of having Mithridates delivered up as his prisoner. This prince, at the arrival of Clodius, who bore the meflage, had made a progress to the coasts of Phcenicia, and to the farther extremities of his empire. To verify the state and title which he assumed of King of Kings, he affected, when he mounted on horseback, to have four captive oIvereigns to walk by his stirrup, and obliged them, on other occasions, to perform every office of me- nial duty and servile attendance on his person. Lucullus, initead of the stile which was asseted by this prince, had accosted him in his letter only with the simple title of king. His meltenger, how- ever, was admitted to an audience, and made his demand that Mithridatcc, a vanquifled enmrny, whose territories were ,!r^dv i the OlPlefion of

c H A P. the Romans, should be delivered up to adorn the x n. vidcor's triumph. This, if refused, said the bearer of
the message, the Roman general would be entitled to extort by force, and would not fail, with a mighty army for that purpose, to pursue his fugi- tive wherever he was received and protected. The king of Armenia, unused even to a plain address, much less to inullt and threats, heard this demand with real indignation; and though, with an ap- pearance of temper, he made offer of the cuftoma- ry presents and honours to the person who deli- vered the metfage, he took his resolution against those from whom it came, and from having bare- ly permitted Mitbridates to take refuge in his kingdom, determined to espouse his cause. He gave for anfwver to Clodius, that he would not de- liver up the unfortunate king, and that, if the Ro- mans invaded his territories, he knew how to de- fend them. He soon afterwards admitted Mithri- dates into his presence, and determined to support him with the necesSary force against his enemies.
Upon receiving this answer from Tigranes, Lu- cullus resolvcd without delay to march into Ar- menia. He chore for this expedition two legions and a body of horse, on whom he prevailed, though with some difficulty, to enter on a new war at a time when they flattered themselves that their la- bours were ended, and that the rewards they ex- pected were within their reach. With hasty mar- ches he arrived on the Euphrates, and pafled that river before the enemy were aware of his approach.
Tigranes
Tigranes treated the first reports of his coming c H A P. with contempt, and ordered the person who pre- xI. fumed to bring such accounts to be puniihed. But being assured, beyond a possibility of doubt, that an enemy was actually on his territories, he sent Metrodorus, one of his generals, at the head of a considerable force, with orders to take alive the person of Lucullus, whom he was desirous to fee, but not to spare a man of the whole army besides.
With these orders, the Armenian general set out on the road by which the Romans were known to advance, and hastened to meet them. Both armies, on the march, had intelligence of each other. Lucullus, upon the approach of the enemy, halted, began to intrench, and, in order to gain time, detached Sextilius, with about three thousand men, to observe the Armenians, and, if possible, without risking an action, to amuse them till his works were completed. But such was the incapacity and presumption of the enemy, that Sextilius, being attacked by them, gained an en- tire vicory with but a part of the Roman army; Metrodorus himself being killed, his army was put to the rout with great slaughter.
After this vitory Lucullus, in order the more effectually to alarm and to diftrad the Armenians, separated his army into three divisions. With one he intercepted and dispersed a body of Arabs, who were marching to join the king ; with another he surprised Tigranes himself, in a disadvantageous iituation, and obliged him to fly with the loss of
his
c H A P. his attendants, equipage, and the baggage of his
_.XV army. At the head of the third division he him-
self advanced to Tigranocerta, and invested that place.
After these disasters Tigranes made an effort to assemble the force of his kingdom; and bringing into the field all the troops of his allies, as well as his own, muttered an army of one hundred and fifty thousand heavy-armed foot, fifty-five thou- sand horse, and twenty thousand archers and fling- ers. He was advised by Mithridates not to risk a battle, but to lay waste the country from which the Romans were supplied with provisions, and there- by oblige them to raise the siege of Triganocerta, and repass the Euphrates, with the disadvantage of having an enemy still in force to hang on their rear. This counsel of Mithridates, founded in the experience he had so dearly bought, was ill suited to the presumption of the king. He there- fore advanced towards the Romans, impatient to relieve his capital, and the principal feat of his magnificence, Lucullus, trusting to the specimens he had already seen of the Armenian armies, ven- tured to divide his force, and, without raising the liege, marched with one division to meet this nu- merous enemy. In the action that followed, the Armenian horse being in the van, were defeated, and driven back on the foot of their own army, threw them into confusion, and gave the Romans an easy victory, in which, with very inconsiderable lois to themselves, they made a great slaughter of
the
the enemy. The king himself, to avoid being c u P- known in his flight, unbound the royal diadem from his head, and left it to become a part in the spoils of the day.
Mariaus, who commanded in Tigranocerta, hearing of his master's defeat, and fearing a re- volt of the Greeks and other foreigners, who had been assembled by force in that settlement, ordered them to be searched and disarmed. This order they looked on as the prelude to a maflacre, and crowd- ing together, defended themselves with the clubs and other weapons they could seize. They fur- rounded a party that was sent to disperse them, and having by that means got a supply of arms, they took poiffeiton of a tower which command- ed one of the principal gates, and from thence in- vited the Romans to enter the place. Lucullus accordingly seized the opportunity, and became malter of the city. The spoil was great; Ti- granes having colleced here, as at the principal feat of his vanity, the wealth and magnificence of his court.
Mithridates, who had been present in the late action, met the king of Armenia in his flight; and, having endeavoured to re-eftablifih his equipage and his retinue by a participation of his own, ex- horted him not to despair, but' to assemble his ar- my anew, and to perlift in the war. They agreed, at the fame time, on an embafly to the king of Parthia, with offers of reconciliation on the part of Tigranes, who, at this time, was at war with
that
c H A P. that prince, and of fatisfadion on the fubjeds in
xv'. . '. contest between them, provided the Parthians
would join in the confederacy againit the Romans. They endeavoured to persuade the king of Par- thia, that he was by no means an unconcerned fpetator in the present conteit; that the quarrel which the Romans now had with the kings of Ar- menia and Pontus, was the fame with that which they formerly had with Philip and with Antio- chus; and which, if not prevented, they would ibon have with Arfaces, and was no other than his being possessed of a rich territory, which tempted their ambition and avarice. Those republicans, they said, originally had not any poffefiions of their own, and were grown rich and great only by the spoils of their neighbours. From their strong-hold in Italy, they had extended their empire on the Wrest to the coast of the ocean; and, if not inter- rupted by the powerful monarchies 'which lay in their way, were hastening to reach a similar boun- dary on the East. The king of Parthia, they added, might expec to be invaded by these insatiable conquerors, and must now determine whether he siould'engage in a war joined with such powerful allies, of whom one by his experience, the other by his resources, might enable him to keep the dan- ger at a distance from his own kingdom r, or wait until these powers being overthrown, and become an acceflion to the Roman force, he should have the contest to maintain in his own territory singly

and unsupported from abroad. To these repre- CH A P. fentations Arfaces seemed to give a favourable ear, XVIJ agreed to the proposed confederacy, on condition that Mesopotamia, which he had formerly claim- ed, was now delivered up to him. At the fame time he endeavoured to amuse Lucullus with of- sers of alliance againit the king of Armenia.
In this conjuncture, it probably was, that Lu- cullus, in the apprehension of being superseded and deprived of the honour of terminating the war, made his report that the kingdom of Mithri- dates was now in his poffeftion, and that the king- dom of Tigranes was also in his power; and there- fore, that the Senate ihould, instead of a fucceifor, fend the usual commission to fettle the form of the province, and to make a proper establishment to preserve the territories which he had already sub- dued. But after these representations were dif- patched by Lucullus, it became apparent that the king of Parthia had deceived him with false pro- feflions, while he actually made great progress in a treaty with his enemies the kings of Armenia and Pontus, and meant to support them with all his force. In resentment of this ad of treachery, or to prevent the effeds of it, Lucullus proposed to carry the war into Parthia; and, for this purpose, ordered the legions that were flationed in Pontus to march without delay into Armenia.
These troops, however, already tired 'of the ser- vice, and fufpeting that they were intended for tome distant and hazardous enterprise, broke out
into
H A P. into open mutiny, and refused to obey their offi- ,XV_ cers. This example was soon afterwards follow-
ed by other parts of the army; and the gene- ral was obliged to confine his operations to the kingdom of Armenia. He endeavoured, by pas- ing the mountains near to the sources of the Eu- phrates and the Tigris, to penetrate as far as Artax- ata, the capital of the kingdom. By this march he forced Tigranes once more to hazard a battle, and obtained a victory; but his own army, not- withstanding their success, were so much difcou- raged with the change of climate, which they ex- perienced in ascending the mountains of Armenia, and with the early and revere approach of winter in those high lands, that they again mutinied, and obliged their general to change his plan of the war. He accordingly turned his march to the iouthward, fell down on Mesopotamia, and, after a short liege, made himself master of Nifibis, a rich city in that territory, where, with other cap- tives, he took Guras, brother to the king, who comr manded in the place.
Here, however, the mutinous spirit frill continu- ing to operate in the Roman army, it began to ap- pear, that the general, who had so often overcome the kings of Pontes and Armenia, was better qua- lified to contend with an enemy, than to win or to preserve the good-will of his own troops. A report being spread that he was soon to be recall- ed, he, from that moment, loit the small remains of his authority; the legions defeited their co-
lours,
loitrs, and treated, with scorn or indifference, all CHA . the attempts which he made to retain them.
This mutinybegan in that part of the army, which, having been transported into Asia, with the Consul Valerius Flaccus at their head, had mur- dered this general, to put themselves under the com- mand of Fimbria, and afterwards deserted their new leader to join with Sylla. Such crimes, under the late unhappy divisions of the republic, either re mained unpunished, or were stated as merits with the party in whose favour the crime was committed. These legions, however, were, by Sylla, who was not willing to employ such infiruments, or to in- trult his own fate, or that of the commonwealth, in such hands, left in Asia, under pretence of fecu- ring the province; and they accordingly made a considerable part in the armies successively com- manded by Murena and by Lucullus. The difpo- fition which they now exhibited, and that of the army in general, to disorder and mutiny, was great- ly excited by the factious spirit of Publius Clodius. the relation of Lucullus, who, having himself taken offence at the general, gave this earnest of his future conduct in the State, by endeavouring to stir up rebellion among the troops. " We, who " have already undergone so many hardships," lie said, " are fill kept on foot to escort the camcls " which carry the treasures of our general, and are " made to purfuc, without end, a couple of bar-
barous fugitives over barren defirts, and unculti. VOL. II. S " tvit .
H A P. " vated waftes, while the soldiers of Pompey, after -xv ' , " a few campaigns in Spain, or in Italy, are ent-
"joying the fruits of their labour in comfortable " settlements, procured by the favour of their
l' ader." Lucullus was so much aware of the decline of his authority, that he did not venture to hazard an affront by attempting to effect even a mere change of position. He hoped, that while he did not iflue any orders of moment, the resolution of his army not to obey him might remain a secret to the ene- my. This slate of his affairs, however, soon became known to Mithridates, and encouraged him to hope he might be able to recover his kingdom. That he might not susser the opportunity to escape him, he fell back into Pontus, with what troops he had then under his command, and, by his authority and in- fluence over his own fubjeas, soon augmented his force, penetrated among the scattered quarters of the Romans, who were left to occupy the coun- try, and separately surprised or destroyed confide- rable bodies of their troops. Among these, he attacked and defeated Fabius, the officer who was entrusted with the general command; and this king, though now turned of seventy, exposing his own perion in the action, received a wound which flopped him in the pursuit of his victory, and by that means prevented its full effec.
Lucullus, being informed of what had passed in Pontus, had influence enough with the army,
oi0
now anxious for their own safety, to put them in c H A P. motion towards that kingdom; but before his ar- XV' rival, Mithridates had ihut up Fabius in Cabira, and defeated Triarius with considerable slaughter. Here again the veteran monarch was wounded; and, to satisfy the troops that he was not dead, was raised up on a platform, where he remained in fight of the army while his wound was drefled. In this last defeat the Romans loft twenty-four le- gionary Tribunes, one hundred and fifty Centu- rions, and seven thousand men.
It was not doubted, however, that Lucullus, on his arrival, if the men had been disposed to ad under his command, would have been able soon to retrieve his affairs: but he was at this time super- feded; and it was known in the army, that Acilius Glabrio was set out from Rome on his way to fuc-' ceed him. The legions, therefore, under pretence that Lucullus was no longer their general, or that they themselves, by a decree of the People, had received their dismission, refused to obey him; and numbers, in fad, began to disband, taking the route of Cappadocia on their return to Italy.
This was the Rate of affairs when the commis- fioners, who, upon the report of Lullucus, had been sent by the Senate to fettle the kingdom of Pontus in the form of a province, acutally arrived. They found the Proconsul deflitute of power in his own camp, and Mithridates, whom they believed. to be vanquifhied, again in pofifficn of his king-

The Roman army in Asia, as a prelude to their present defection, had been taught to contrait the parsimony of Lucullus with the liberality and mu- nificence of Pompey, and from the comparison they made, were impatient to change their leader, a dif- position, which, it is not doubted, Pompey, by his intrigues, and with the aid of his agents, greatly encouraged. He could in reality ill brook the private station to which, by his late oath, in en- tering on the Consulate, he had bound himself. As he ever studied to support the public opinion of his own importance, he wiihed for occasions to derive tome advantage from that opinion; but no- :hing had occurred for twvo years that was worthy ds the high diflindion tp which he aspired. The command in Asia he coveted the more, that it seem- ed to be secured to Lucullus by the splendor of his successes, and by the unanimous judgment of the Senates and Nobles, who knew his faithful attach- ment to their order, and his fidelity to the arifto- cratical part of the conflitution. The difficulties in that fcrvice were over, and nothing but the glory of terminating the war remained. Pompey, either from envy to Lucullus, or from a design to openl a way to this glory for himself, contributed to the appointment of Glabrio, and to She nomina- ;ion of the TrPetors, who were sent with separate commands into the provinces of Asia and Bythi-

nia. If, upon the change he had thus produced, c H A P. the war flould become unsuccessful, or languish, I he had hopes to be called for by the general voice of the People, as the only person fit to bring it to a happy concluiion. Meanwhile a project was started, which was to place him near to this fcenc of action, and, if judged expedient, was likely to facilitate his farther removal, to the command of the army in Pontus.
The pirates frill continued to infest the seas, and were daily rising in their presumption, and in- creasing in' their flrength. They were receiving continual accession of numbers from those, who, by the unsettled state of Asia, were forced to join them for fubfitence. The impunity which they enjoyed during the diftra&ion of councils at Rome, and the profits they made by their depredations, encouraged many who frequented the seas to en- gage in the fame way of lite. They had been chaced, and numbers of them taken by M.' Anto- nius the orator, by Scrvilius Ifauricus, and, last of all, by C. Antonius, the father of him who, in the quality of Triumvir, is to become so conspicuous in the sequel of this history. But they had their retreats; and, upon the leafn remission of vigi- lance in the Roman officers, they again multiplied apace, put to sea in formidable tfquadrons, and embarked such numbers of men, as not only en- abled them to scour the seas, but likewise to make lefcents on the coasts, to enter harbours, destroy Ihipping, and pillage the maritime towns. They
S 3 cove-n
CHA.P. even ventured to appear off the mouth .of the XVs. ^-iL, Tiber, and to plunder the town of Ostia itself.
All the coafls of the empire were open to their depredations. Roman magifirates were made pri- foners in palling to and from their provinces; and citizens of every denomination, when taken by them, were forced to pay ransom, kept in captivity, pr put to death. The supply of provisions to Italy was intercepted, or rendered precarious and dif- ficult, and the price in proportion enhanced. Eve- ry report on these fubjeds was exaggerated by the intrigues of Pompey, who perceived, in this oc- cation of public distress, the object of a pew and extraordinary commission to himself.
Frequent complaints having been made, and frequent deliberations held on this subjed in the Senate, Gabinius, one of the Tribunes, at last pro- posed, that some officer of Consular rank should be veiled, during three years, with absolute powers, in order to put an effectual flop to there outrages, and to eradicate the cause of them, so as to secure for the future the inhabitants of the coast, as well as to protect the navigation of the seas. As Ga- binius was known to be in concert with Pompey, the design of the proposition was manifest; and it was received in the Senate with a general aversion.
For this," it was said, " has Pompey declined " the ordinary turn of Consular duty upon the "expiration of his office, that he might lie in ' wait for extraordinary and illegal appointments." Gabinius being threatened with violence if he
Ihould
should persist in his motion, thought proper to C-H AP. withdraw from the assembly. XV.
A report was immediately spread in the city, that the person of the Tribune Gabinius had been actually violated; multitudes assembled at the doors of.the Senate-houfe, and great disorders were likely to follow; it was judged prudent for the Se- nate to adjourn; and the members, dreading some insult from the populace, retired by sep.arate ways to their own houses. Gabinius, without farther regard to the .difent of the Senate, prepared to carry his motion to the People; but the other nine Tribunes were inclined to oppose him. Tre- bellius and Roscius, in particular, were engaged to put a flop by their negative, to any further pro- ceedings on that business. Pompey, in the mean time, with a dissimulation which conIfituted part of his character, affeded to Aiifapprove the motion of Gabinius, and to decline the commission with which it was proposed to invest him. He had recourse to this affectation, not merely as the fittest means on the present occasion to disarm the envy of the No- bles, and to confirm the People in their choice; but still more as a manner of proceeding which suited his own difpofitionl being no less desirous to appear forced and courted into high situations, than folici- tous to gain and to hold them. He thus provoked the citizens of his own rank, no less by the fhal- low arts which he pradtifed to impose on the pu- blic, than by the fate which he assumed. He could scarcely expecA to find a support in the or-
S 4 der
CH a p. der of Nobles, and lcaft of all among those who _,._.. were likely to become the personal rivals of his
fortune in the commonwealth: and yet it is men- tioned, that Julius Cefar, now about two-and- thirty years of age, and old enough to diftinguifli his natural antagonists in the career of ambition, took part with the creatures of Pompey on this occasion. He was disposed to court the popular sac- tion, and to oppose the aristocracy; either of which principles may explain his conduct in this instance. He had himself already incurred the displeasure of the Senate, but more as a libertine than as a disturber of the State, in which he had not hither- to taken any material part. In common with the youth of his time, he disliked the Senators, on ac- count of the remaining austerity of their manners, no less than the inferior people disliked them on ac- count of their ariftocratical claims to authority and power. But whatever we may suppose to have been his motives, Caxfar, even before he seemed to have formed any ambitious designs of his own, was ever ready to abet those of any desperate adventurer who counteracted the Senate, or set the orders of government at nought; and seemed to be actuated by a species of inflinc, which set him at variance with every form of a civil or political nature, if it checked the licence of faction, or bore hard on disorderly citizens of any fort'.
On the day in which the quelfion respeCting the motion of Gabinius was to be put to the People,
Pompey · 4::?,ra., A:- 'il'. x, c. 3
Pompey appeared in the Comitium; and, if we may c i A P. judge from the speech which is a'cribed to him, v employed a dissimulation and artifice somewhat too gross even for the audience to which it was ad- drelned. He took occasion to thank the People for the honours he had received; but complained, that, having already toiled so much in the public service, he still should be destined for new labours. " You " have forgotten," 'he said, " the dangers I en-
countered, and the fatigues I underwent, while yet almost a boy, in the war with Cinna, in the " wars in Sicily and in Africa, and what I susser-
e( cd in Spain, before I was honoured with any ,' magistracy, or was of age to have a place in the "Senate. But I mean not to accuse you of in- ' gratitude; on the contrary, I have been fully " repaid. Your nomination of me to conducl the ' war with Sertorius, when every one else declin- l' ed the danger, I confider as a favour; and the "extraordinary triumph you bestowed in confe- ' quence of it, as a very great honour. But I " must entreat you to confider, that continued "application and labour exhaust the powers of ' the mind as well as those of the body. Trust ' not to my line of life alone, nor imagine that I " am still a young man, merely because my number
of years is ihort of what others have attained. " Reckon my services and the dangers to which
I have been exposed; they will exceed the "number of my years, and satisfy you, that I ' cannot much longer endure the labours and
" careC
CHAP. "'cares which are now proposed for me. But if
XVI. L "( this be not granted me, I muit beg of you to
" confider what loads of envy such appointments "are likely to draw upon me from men, whose "displeasure, I know, you neither do, nor ought
to regard, although to me their envy might be "fatal: and I confers, that, of all the difficul- " ties and dangers of war, I fear nothing so much " as this. To live with envious persons; to be ' called to account for miscarriage, if one fails " in the public service; and to be envied, if one " succeeds; who would choose to be employ- ( ed on such conditions? For these, and many " other reasons, I pray you to leave me at reft; "leave me to the care of my family, and of my a' private affairs. As for the present service, I (' pray you to choose, among those who desire the "' employment, some person more proper; among " so many, you cannot surely be at a loss. I am " not the only person that loves you, or that has i experience in military affairs. There are many, " whose names, to avoid the imputation of flat- ' tery, I will not mention."
To this speech Gabinius replied; and, affecting to believe the sincerity of Pompey's declarations, observed, that it was agreeable to the character of this great man, neither to desire command, nor raflly to accept of what was pressed upon him.
They who are best able to surmount difficul- "ties," he said, " are likewise least inclined to ' engage in them. But it is your business, fellow-
" citizens,
citizens, to confider, not what is agreeable to CHAP. Pompey, but what is necessary to your own as- V fairs; not to accept of those who court you for offices, but of those who are fit to discharge the ( duties of them. I wifll we had many persons
of this description, besides the man I have propo- "fed to your choice. Did we not all with for
such persons likewise, when we searched among "the young and the old for some one to be oppo- " fed to Sertorius, and found none but himself? " But wifies cannot avail us; we must take men ' as they are; we cannot create them. If there " be but one man formed for our purpose, with "knowledge, experience, and good fortune, we
must lay hold of him, and seize him, if necessary, " even by force. Compulsion here is expedient "and honourable for both parties; for those who " employ it, because it is to find them a person " who can conduct their affairs; for him who " fffers it, because he is to have an opportunity ' of serving his country, an object for which no " good citizen will refuse to expose his person, or ' to sacrifice his life.
" Do you think that Pompey, while yet a boy, was fit to command armies, to protect your al- "lies, to reduce your enemies, to extend your "empire; but that now in the prime of life, ripe "in wisdom and experience, he can serve you no
longer ? You employed the boy, you susser the "man to be idle. When a private citizen of 'Equeffrian rank, he was fit for war and affairs of
" State;
C H A P." State; now he is a Senator, forsooth, he is fit for
xvr. L "_-.( nothing ! Before you had any trial of him, you
" made choice of him for the most important trust; " now that you have experience of his ability, of ' his conduct, and of his success, you hesitate. Is "the present occasion less pressing than the for- " mer? Is the antagonist of Sertorius not fit to *' contend with pirates ? But such absurdities can- < not be received by the Roman People. As for " you Pompey, submit to the will of your fellow,-
citizens. For this you was born, for this you ' was educated. I call upon you as the property " of your country; I call upon you as its safe-
guard and its defence. I call upon you to lay " down your life, if necessary. This I know, if " your country require it, you will not, you can- 4 not refuse.
" But it is ridiculous to accost you in this man- " ner; you who have proved your courage and " your love to your country in so many and fuclh " arduous trials. Be ruled by this great aflembly. " Despise the envy of a few, or study the more to "deserve the general favour. Let the envious " pine when they hear of your ad ions, it is whai " they deserve. Let us be delivered from the ' evils by which we are surrounded, while you ' proceed to end your life as you began it, with ' success and with glory."
When Gabinius had finiflhed his speech, Trc- bellius another of the Tribune%, attempted to re- ply; but such . clamour was immediately railed
by
by the multitude, that he could not be heard. CHAP. He then, by the authority of his office, sorbad the XV. - question; and Gabinius instantly proposed to have the sense of the Tribes, Whether Trebellius had hot forfeited the charalcer of Tribune ? Seventeen Tribes were of this opinion, and the eighteenth would have made the majority, when Trebellius thought proper to withdraw his negative. Ro- fcius, another of the Tribunes, intimated by signs (for he could not be heard) that a second fiould be joined with Pompey in this commission. But the clamour was renewed, and the meeting likely so end in riot and violence. Then all opposition to the motion was dropt. And, in this state of the business, Gabinius, trusting that, in the present hu- mour of the People, no man would dare to oppose the measure, or wilhing to increase the honour of Pompey's nomination, by the seeming concurrence of tome of the more refpeaable citizens, called( upon Catulus, who was then first on the roll of the Senate, to deliver his opinion, and led him up in- ,o the rostra for this purpofc.
This citizen, by the equability of his conduc, aind by his moderation, though in support of the aristocracy, had great authority even with the op- pofite party. He began his speech to the People with profeflions of public zeal, which obliged him to de- liver with plainness what he thought was conducive io their good, and which ;entitled him to a delibe- rate hearing, before they should pronounce on the ,r.its of what 1he wl about to (1lii'Cr. " If you
" lien,"
C H A P. liten," he said, "( something may fill be offered
XVI . to inform your judgment; if you break forth
again into disorders and tumults, your capacity "and good underfianding will avail you nothing.
I must begin with declaring my opinion, that powers so great, and for so long a time as are " now proposed for Pompey, ihould not be com- ' mitted to any tingle citizen whatever.
The precedent is contrary to law, and in it- " self, in the highest degree, dangerous to the *' State. Whence came the usurpations of Marius, " but from the habit of continual command; " from his being put at the head of every army, ' intrufed with every war, and no less than fix "times re-eleced Consul in the space of a few "'years ? What inflamed to such a degree the ar- " rogant spirit of Sylla, but the continual com-
mand of armies, and the exorbitant power or " Didator ? Such is human nature, that in age, as " well as in youth, we are debauched with power; *' and if inured for any time to ad as superiors,
e cannot submit afterwards to the equal and " moderate flation of citizens.
" I speak not with any particular reference to " Pompey; I speak what the law requires, and " lwhat I am sure is for your good. If high office "and public trufl be an honour, every one who "has pretensions should enjoy them in his turn; if ' they be a load or a burden, every one ought to " bear his part. These are the laws ofjuftice and
of republican government. By observing them,
" republics
republics have an advantage over most other CHAP;
XVI. , Rates. By employing many men in their turns, ,
they educate and train many citizens for every department, and have numbers amongst whom they may choose the fittest to serve on every par- ticular emergence. But if we susser one or a " few to engross every office or service of mo- " ment, the lift of those who are qualified for
any such trust will decrease in proportion. If we always recur to the fame person in every try- "ing occasion, we ihall soon have no other per-
f' son to employ. Why were we so much at a ' loss for experienced commanders, when Serto-
rius appeared to threaten Italy with an inva- ' sion ? Because command, for a considerable time "before that period, had been engroifed by a few, ( and those few alone had any experience. Al. "though, therefore, I have the highest opinion "of Pompey's abilities and qualification for this " service, I must prefer to his pretensions the
public utility and the express declaration of the " laws.
"You annually eled Consuls and Praetors: to " what purpose ? to serve the State, or to carry

So much of what Catulus is supposed to have delivered on this occasion is preserved among the fragments of Dion. Cassius '. It is mentioned by others, that the audience expreifed their good-will and refpedt for this Senator in a compliment which they paid to him, probably near the close of his i)peech, when urging some of his former argu- ments, he asked, " If this man to whom alone, by ' thus employing him in every service, you give "an opportunity of acquiring the skill and habits. "of a statesman or soldier, ihould fall, to whom
w ill you next have recourse ?" The People an- fwered, with a general acclamation, 7o yourfelfy. They revered, for a moment, the candour and abi- lity of this eminent citizen, but could not with- Ilanld the arts of Pompey, and the tide of popu- larity, which then ran so high in his favour.
T'his day being far spent in debate, another day was appointed in which to collec the votes, when a decree pafled to 'vest Pompey with the supreme command over all the fleets and armies of the re- public, in every sea without diftincion or limit,

C Hr A p. and on every coast within four hundred stadia, or , Xv . fifty miles of the ihore. This commission took place
in Italy, and extended throughout every province, during three years from the time of the ad being passed.
As Pompey owed these cxtraordinary powers to the Tribune Gabinius, he intended to have em- ployed him next in command to himself; but the law which excluded the Tribunes from fuc- ceeding to any public employment, in the first year after the expiration of their office, flood in the way of this choice; and Pompey did not persist in it.
Upon the publication of an edid investing an of- sicer of so much renown with such mighty powers for restoring the navigation of the seas, corn and every other article of importation at Rome con- fiderably fell in their price. The friends of Pom- pey already triumphed in the success of their measure, and he himself soon after, notwithftand- ing the meanness of the enemy opposed to him, gained much credit by the rapid, decisive and es- fectual measures he took to obtain the end of his appointment. Although it was the middle of winter, a season too rough, even in the Mediter- ranean, for such shipping as was then in use, he gave orders to arm and put to sea as many vefiels as could be collected or fitted out in every mara- time station. In a little time he had returns of two hundred and seventy gallies fit for service, one hundred and twenty thousand foot, and four thou- sand horse embodied within the limits to which his
commission
commission extended. That the pirates might be c H A P.' every where attacked at once, and find no refuge by ^,XVI changing their usual places of retreat, he divided the coasts of the empire into separate diftrids, appoint- ed lieutenants with full powers in each, afligned their flations, and allotted their quotas of ihipping and troops. He himself, with a squadron of lixty Ihips, proposed to inlped the whole, or to give his pretence where it ihould be required. He began with visiting the ports of Spain and Gaul, and the seas of Sardinia and Corsica; and in passing from thence, he himself went on flore, and travelled by land, while his squadron, coasting round the penin- fula of Italy, had orders to join him at Brundisium. In this j6urney, upon his approach to Rome, he en- joyed, in all refpeds, the Ilate of a great monarch, was received with acclamations by the People, and was courted by multitudes of every condition who went forth to receive him. All his complaints and representations were received as commands. The Consul Pifo, being supposed not to forward his le- vies with sufficient alacrity, would have been de- graded, if Pompey himself had not interposed to prevent a motion which the Tribune Gabinius in- tended to make for this purpose.
The fleet being arrived at Brundisium, Pompey hastened to reimbark, and from thence paifed by the Rfations of his several lieutenants in the sea-ports of Macedonia and Greece, to those of Pamphylia and Cilicia, which were the principal resort of the pirates. Such of theie banditti, as he captured in his
T z way,
'CH A P. way, were treated with mildness; and this ci'- ,i " ,cumfrance, together with the great preparations
which were reported from every quarter to be making against them, with the small hopes they had of being able to escape, induced them, in great numbers, to surrender themselves. In the bay of Cilicia he found a squadron of their ships as- fembled, and ready to cover the harbours at which they had been accuflomed to collect their naval itores, and to lodge their booty. They separated, however, upon his appearance, took refuge in dif- ferent creeks of that mountainous fiore, and as- terwards surrendered at discretion, delivering up ail the forts they had eredted, with all their flores of timber, cordage, and fails, of which they had made a considerable provision.
By these means the war was finished about the middle of summer, fix months after the nomina- tion of Pompcy to this command. In that time leventy-two gallies were funk, three hundred and iix were taken, and a hundred and twenty pirati- cal harbours or firong-holds on fior were de- flroyed. Ten thousand of the pirates were killed in action, and twenty thousand, who had furren- dered themselves, remained prisoners at the end of the war. These Pompey, having fufliciently de- prived of the means of returning to their former way of life, transplanted to different parts of the continent,where the late or present troubles, by thin- ning the inhabitants, had made room mfr their set- tlement. Upon this occasion he repeopled the city
of
of Soli in Cilicia, which had been lately laid waste, c H A P.
xv'. and forcibly emptied of its inhabitants by Ti- xv__ granes, to replenish his newly eftablifled capital of Tigranocerta in Armenia. After this re-establish- ment of Soli, the place, in honour of its restorer, came to be known by the name of Pompeiopolis l.
Whilst this successful commissioner was thus em- ployed in disposing of the pirates on the coast of Cilicia, he received a mesSage from Lappa in the island of Crete, then besieged by Metellus, inti- mating that the people of this place, although they held out against Metellus, were willing to furren- der to Pompey. This fort of preference implying estimation and popular regard, was one of the temptations which Pompey was supposed unable to retift; he accordingly, without consulting with Metellus, sent an officer to receive the surrender of Lappa.
Mctellus had commanded about two years in Crete, had almost reduced the island, and had a near profpece of that triumph, which he after- wards, with the title of Creticus, actually obtain- ed, on account of this conquefl. Pompey's com- mifilon, as commander in chief of all the sea and land forces of Rome within fifty miles of the coast, no doubt, extended to Lappa; but it was justly reckoned invidious to interfere in the province of a Proconsul, whose appointment preceded his own. And this ftep revived all the former impu- tations against him, that he confidered himself as every one's superior, strove to suppress every grow-
T 3 ing x Dion. Caflisr, lib, xxxvi. c. 2Q.
c H A P. ing fame, and threw his personal consideration as
,Y' , a bar in the way of every rising merit. Metellus,
flung with resentment, and trufling to the support of the Senate, ventured to contemn his orders; even after Od2avius, who had been sent by Pompey to take the inhabitants of Lappa under his protec- tion, had entered the town, and in his name com- manded Metellus to desist from the attack of a place already in pofneffion of the Romans. He nevertheless continued the siege, forced the town to surrender, and threatening to treat Octavius him- self as a rebel, obliged him to be gone from the island. The Senate, without otherwise deciding the controversy which was likely to arise on this sub- jecd, afterwards acknowledged Metellus as the con- queror of Crete, and decreed him a triumph in that capacity '.
The dispute, however, at this time, might have led to disagreeable consequences, if Pompey, while he was preparing to pass into Crete against Me- tellus, had not found another object of more im- portance to his plan of greatness . Lucullus had always appeared to him a rival in power and con- fideration more formidable than Metellus, and the war in Pontus and Armenia, likely to furniflh a more ample field of glory than the deftrudion of pirates.
Mithridates, though once nearly vanquiffied, was, by means of the diftracions which, commu-

nicating from the popular factions at Rome, had c H A P. infected the army of Lucullus, enabled to renew X the war with frefli vigour. Knowing that the Ro- man general was no longer obeyed, he not only ob- tained possession, as has been mentioned, of his own kingdom, but, together with Tigranes, began to adt on the offensive, and made excursions even into Ci- licia. Acilius Glabrio, the Proconsul appointed to succeed in the command of the Roman army, hear- ing the bad state of affairs in Pontus, flopped short in Bithynia, and even refused to furnish Lucullus with the reinforcements he had brought from Ita- ly. In there circumstances the province of Asia, likely to become a principal source of revenue to the commonwealth, was in imminent danger of being wreIted from their hands; and the friends of Pompey seized this opportunity to propose a farther enlargement of his powrers. Manilius, one of the Tribunes, in concert with Gabinius, moved the People to extend his commission to the provinces of Phrygia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Pontus; and of'courfe to commit the war in Armenia and Pontus to his diredion. This motion was ftrenu- oufly opposed by Catulus, Hortenlius, and all the principal members of the Senate. It was support- ed by Marcus Tullius Cicero and by Caius Julius Cafar, who both intended, on this occasion, to court the popular party, by espousing the cause of a person so much in favour with the People.
Cicero was one of the firit of the Romans who refted his consideration entirely on civil accomplish-
T 4 ments,
HA P. ments, and who became great by the services he '-h U was qualified to render his friends in a civil capa-
city, without any pretensions to the merit of a fol- dier. The character of a pleader was become one of the moif powerful recommendations to public .notice, and one of the surest roads to consequence and civil preferment. Cicero, with a fine genius .and great application, was supposed to excel all who had gone before him in this line of pursuit. His talents were powerful instruments in his own hands; they rendered him necessary to others, and procured him the court(hip of every party in its turn. lie was underitood to favour the ariftocra- cy, and was inclined to support the Senate, as the great bulwark' of the State, against the licence of the populace, and the violence of fac'ious leaders. But being now Prator, with a near profpccR of the Consulate, he sacrificed much to his ambition in -the pursuit of preferments, which wlere new in his family, and whichl the antient nobility were difpo- ied to envy. His speech, upon the motion of Mani- lius, was the first he had -ever made in a political character: it is still extant, and does more honour to his talents as a pleader, than to his steadiness in support of the constitution and government of his country'. He turned aside, by artful evasions, the wife counsels of Hortenfius and Cattlus; and, un- der pretence of setting forth the merits of Pom- pey, and of' fating precedents in his favour, daz- ;led his audience, by enumerating the irregular
honours j Cicer. Orat. pro Lcgc iMailia .
honours which they themselves had already con- HAP. ferred on this objec of their favour.
With such able advocates, in a cause to which the People were already so well disposed, the ihte- reft of Pompey could not miscarry; and an addi- tion was accordingly made to his former commis- sion, by which he became in reality sovereign of .the fairest part of the empire. Upon the arrival of this news in Cilicia, where he then was, he as- feted surprise and displeasure. " Are my ene- " mies," he said, " never to give me any respite C from war and trouble ?" He had talents, un- doubtedly, sufficient to support him in the use of means less indirect; but a disposition to artifice, like every other ruling paflion, will stifle the plain- *.et fuggcftions of reason, and seems to have made him forget, on the present occasion, that his own attendants at least had common penetration. They turned away from the farce which he acted with flame and disgust '; and he himfclf made no delay in showing the avidity with which he received what he thus affected to dislike; laid aside all thoughts of other business; immediately dispatch- ed his orders to all the provinces that were now subjected to his power; and, without passing his mandates through the hands of Lucullus, summon- ed Mithridates, then with an army of between thirty and forty thousand men on the frontier of Pontus, to surrender himself at discretion. This prince, being then in treaty with Phraates, who
had , I Phltarch. in Pompeio,
aAPr. had lately succeeded his father Arfaces in the -XV' kingdom of Parthia, and being in expectation of
a powerful support from that quarter, refused to liften to this imperious mefnage: and being difap. pointed in his hopes of assistance from the Par- thians, and finding that Phraates had joined in a league with his enemies, he endeavoured to pacify the Roman general; and finding that his advances for this purpose had no effec, he prepared for a vigorous reiiftance.
Pompey set out for Pontus, and in his way had an interview with Lueullus, who was then in Ga-. latia. They accosted each other at first with la- boured expressions of refped and of compliment on their respective services, but ended with dif- putes and sharp altercations. Pompey accused Lucullus of precipitation, in flating the kingdom of Pontus as a PRoman province, while the king himself was alive and at liberty. Lucullus sus- pec6ed that the late mutiny had been fomented by the emissaries of Pompey, to make way for his own succession to the command. He persisted in maintaining the propriety of the report which he had made to the Senate, and in which he had re- presented the kingdom of Pontus as conquered, and in which he had desired that commissioners should be sent as usual to secure the poffefion; observed that no province could be kept, if the troops Rationed to preserve it refused to obey their general; that if fich disorders wcre made the en- gine of politics in the competition of candidates
for
for office, the republic had worse consequences cHAP. to fear than the loss of any diitant province; that xv' although the fugitive king had taken advantage of the factions at Rome and in the army, to put him- self again at the head of some forces, he had not recovered any considerable portion of his kingdom, nor at the arrival of the commissioners of the Se- nate, been able to disturb them in fettling the pro- vince; that there was then nothing left for a fuc- ceflor, but the invidious task of snatching at the glory which had been won by another.
From this conference Pompey entered on the command with many indications of animosity to Lucullus; he suspended the execution of his or- ders; changed the plan of his operations; remit- ted the puniflments, and recalled the rewards he had decreed to particular persons, and in a manner which seemed to justify the suspicion of his having encouraged the late disorders, suffered them to pass with impunity; and treated with the usual confidence even the legions which had refused to obey the orders of their general. His own au- thority, in the outset, seemed to be secured by the animosity of the army to their late commander, and by their desire to contrafi their own conduct, and the success of the war under their present leader, with that which had taken place under his predecefior. Finding hinmfelf, therefore, at the head of numecrous and well-affeced forces, both by sea and by land, he covered the coasts of the .1'gean and Euxine Scas with his galleys, and,
at
C HA F. at the head of a great army, advanced in fcarch of
XVI.
, the enemy.
Mithridates, upon the approach of Pompey, continued retiring before him towards the LefTer Armenia, laid waste the country through which the Roman army was to pass, endeavouring to distress them by the want of provisions and forage.
For several days fuccefively the armies encamp- ed in fight of each other. Mithridates took his posts in such a manner, that he could not be safely at- tacked; and as his objec was to pass the Euphrates without being forced to a battle, he generally le- camped in the night, and, by his superior knowledge of the country, passed through ways in which the Roman army could not hastily follow without ma- nifeft danger of surprise. Pompey, sensible that, upon this plan of operation, the- king of Pontus muff effec&l his retreat, took a resolution to pass him by a forced march, not in the night but in the heat.of the day, when the troops of Asia were molt inclined to repose. If he should succeed in this design, and get betwreen their army and the Euphrates, he hoped to force them to a battle, or oblige them to change their route. According- vl, on the day he had chosen for this attempt, he doubled his march, paired the enemy's camp at noon-day unobserved, and was actually potled on their route, when they began to decamp, as usual, on the following night. In the encounter which followed, having all the advantages of a surprise, :ind in the dark, against an army on its march, and
little
little accustomed to order, he gained a decisive c H-A p. vitory, in which he cut off or dispersed all the XVI. forces on which the king of Pontus had relied for the defence of his kingdom I.
Mithridates escaped with a few attendants; and, in this extremity, proposed to throw himself again into the arms of Tigranes; but was refused by this prince, who was himself then attacked by a rebellion of his own son. Upon this disappoint- ment he fled to the northward, passing by the sources of the Euphrates to the kingdom of Col- chis, and from thence, by the eastern coasts of the Euxine, to the Scythian Bosphorus, now the Straits of CosTa, in order to take refuge in the Cherfone- sus, or Crim Tartary, at Panticapea, the capital of a kingdom which he himself had acquired, and which he had bestowed on Machares, one of his sons. Upon his presenting himself at this place, he found that Machares had long iince abandoned his father's fortunes; and, upon hear- ing of the ill itate of his affairs on his sirs flight from Lucullus into Armenia, had sent, as an of fering or peace, a golden crown to that general, and lsed for the protedion of the Romans. The father, highly provoked with this act of pufilani- mity or treachery, aflembled a force among his Scythian allies, and, deaf to all offers of fubmiflion or entreaties of this undutiful son, dragged him from the throne, and either ordered him to be put to death, or made his situation io painful, that he thought proper to put an end to his own !it.
In.
C H A P. In this manner Mithridates entered anew on
I_., the possession of a kingdom, in which he had not
only a safe retreat, but likewise the means of exe- cuting new projects of war against his enemies. By the maxims of the Romans, which Pompey himself had urged in his late dispute with Lucul. lus, no kingdom was supposed to be conquered, till the king was either killed, taken, or forced to surrender; and the Roman general, by this flight of the king of Pontus, found himself un- der a necessity either of pursuing him into his present retreat, or of doing what he himself had blamed in his predecessor, by making his report of a conquest before it was fully accomplished. While he was deliberating on the measures to be taken in these circumitances, he was invited by the younger Tigranes, son to the king of Armenia, then in re- bellion against his father, to enter with his army in- to that kingdom, and to give judgment on the dif- ferences subsisting between the father and the son.
In consequence of this invitation, Pompey marched into Armenia, joined the rebel prince, and, under pretence of supporting the son, was about to firip the father of his kingdom, when this monarch, as usual, with a meanness propor- tioned to the presumption with which he had en- joyed his prosperity, now resolved to cait himself entirely upon the vidcor's mercy. For this pur- ri'e he desired to be admitted into Pompey's pre- iJnce, and, with a few attendants, presented him- fl- ftor this purpose. Being told, at the entrance
n t,'
of the camp, that no itranger could pass on horse- c H A P. back, he dismounted, and was conducted on foot - to the general's pretence. In entering the tent, he uncovered his head, and having the diadem in his hand, offered to lay it on the ground at Pompey's feet; but was told with great courte- fy, that he might resume it; that, by submitting himself to the generosity of the Romans, he had not loit a kingdom, but gained a faithful ally '. At the fame time, under pretence of reimbursing the expence of the war, a fum of fix thousand ta- lents, or about one million one hundred and twen- ty-eight thousand pounds fierling was exaded from him; and he himself, to this great fum which was paid to the State, added a gratuity to the ar- my of a talent ' to each of the Tribunes, ten mi- nae 3 to each of the Centurions, and half a mina 4 to each private man.
Pompey, in disposing of the two Armenias, which were now in his power, allotted Sophene, or the Lesser Armenia, on the right of the Euphrates, to Tigranes the son, reserving Syria and Phoenicia, to which Antiochus, the last representative of the Macedonian line, had been restored by Lucullus, together with Cilicia and Galatia, to the disposal of the Romans.
Tigranes the father with great fubmiflion ac- quiefced in this partition ; but the son, who pro-

c n Ap. bably expeced to have been put in poffeflion of
XVI the whole of his father's kingdom, was greatly dif-
contented, and, while Pompey was yet in Arme- nia, entered into a correspondence with the king of Parthia, and solicitcd his aflifance to overturn the settlement which was now made. On account of these practices, whether real or supposed, this un- dutiful son of Tigranes was taken into cuflody, carried into Italy, and made a part in the orna- ments of the victor's triumph '.
The Roman general, having in this manner dif- posed of the kingdom of Armenia, or retained it still farther at the disposal of the Romans, by the con- finement of the rebel prince, resumed the thoughts of pursuing Mithridates into his preient retreat. For this purpose he left Afranius in Armenia, with a force fuficient to secure his rear, and to prevent any disturbance on this fide of the Euphrates. He himself pased the Araxes, and wintered on the Cyrus, or the Cyrnus, on the confines of Albania and Iberia. In the following summer, having de- feated the natives of those countries in repeated encounters, he advanced to the mouth of the Pha- sis, where he was joined by his fleet, then plying in the Euxine Sea, under the command of Servi- lius. Here he appears to have deliberated, whe- ther he should attempt to purfuc Mithridates any farther; but upon confidering the difficulties of the voyage, and of the march along a coast and a coun- try entirely unknol n, unfurnilhcd with any fate

harbour.for his ihips, or' even with any means of c H A P.
XVI. subsistence to his army'by land, he took his refo- lution to return, and to avail himself, in the best manner he was able, of the dominions which had been abandoned to him by the flight of their king'. With this resolution he directed his march, by the coast, back into the kingdom of Pontus; and, find- ing no refiflance, took all his measures as in a con- quered province. At one place he found a con- lideralle treasure,- which was disclosed to him by Stratonice, one of the concubines of the king, by whom she had a son named Xiphares. This wo; manl made the discovery on condition that; if her son were taken by the Romans, his life should be spared. But this unhappy son was exposed to other dangers besides those now apprehended by the mother. Mithridates, upon hearing of the price which was paid for the life of Xiphares, or- dered him to be slain. " That woman," he said, "fllould have likewise bargained with me in fa+ " vour of her son." At other places the Roman army found the vefliges of great magnificence, joined to monuments of superstition and of cruelty. They found some produtions of an art, in which the king was supposed to be master, relating to the compolition of poisons, and of their antidotes, and some records of dreams, together with the inter- pretations I, which had been given by his women.
From Pontus, Pompey, having made a proper disposition of the fleet in the Euxine, to defend the

C H A P. coast againit attempts of invasion from Mithrida-
. tes, whose forces were still formidable on the Bof-
phorus and the opposite shores, set out for the kingdom of Syria, which he now determined to seize in behalf of the Romans. Lucullus had al- ready, agreeably to the policy of his country, or under pretence.of fetting-the Syrians free, fepara- ted their kingdom from the other possessions of Ti- granes: but.tthe pretence upon which he ated in this matter being sufficient to prevent his seizing upon Syria as a Roman province, he was content, in the mean time, with restoring it to Antiochus, the last pretender of the Macedonian line, who had lived eighteen years in -the greatest obscurity in Cilicia. But Pompey now proposed to complete the tranfaclion, by seizing for. the Romans them- selves, what the other asseted' only to restore to the lawful owner r; and this; owner now pleaded in vain against the senten'ce of Pompey.that right of descent from the Macedonian line, which Lu- cullus had employed to ftipplant Tigranes 2.
On the march.into Syria, the Roman general, either in person or by his lieutenants, received the submission of all the principalities or diftricds in his way, and made the following arrange- ·*ments. The Lesser Armenia, once intended for the younger Tigranes, he gave to Dejotarus, king of Galatia 3, -who remained on the frontier of the empire a.faithful dependent, and wvhofe pof- sessions served as a barrier against hostile inva-
sions r Juftin. lib. xl. c. r. & 2. n Appia'n. in Mititridat. p. 244. 5. Eutropi'i', lil, vi.
lions from that quarter. Paphlagonia was given H A P. to Attalus and Pylaemenus, who were liberal xv., triubtaries to the Roman officers, and vigilant guards on the frontiers of the empire. Upon his arrival at Dainafcus, he had many applica- tions from the late fubjeas or dependents of the Syrian monarchy; among others, from Hyrcanus and Ariftobulus, two brothers contending for the sovereignty of Judea, who now repaired to his tri- bunal for judgment, and requested the interpofi- tion of his power in behalf of the party he should be pleated to favour.
Of these rivals, who were the sons of Alexan- der, late high-prieft of the Jews, Hyrcanus the el- der had succeeded to his mother Alexandra, whom the father had left his immediate successor in the kingdom; but was difpofTiefed by his younger brother Ariftobulus, who, being of a more active spirit, had formed a powerful fadcion against him among the people.
Hyrcanus took refitge among the Arabs, and prevailed upon Aretas, the chieftain of some power- ful tribe of that people, to assist 'him in recover- ing the sovereignty of his country. In conjunc- tion with this ally, Hyrcanus accordingly laid siege to Jerusalem, but was disappointed of his ob- jet by Scaurus, one of Pompey's lieutenants, who being then in Syria, interposed at the request of Xkriftobulus, fromn whom he received a prefcnt of three hundred ta!lets , and obliged the Arabs
I2T 3 tto i A';ou : . 5 . ****
:HAP. to defitl from their enterprize. Upon the arri-
-';. val of Gabinius, whom Pompey had sent before
him into Syria, Ariftobulus thought proper to make him likewise a present of fifty talents, and by these means remained in poifeffion of Jerusalem at the arrival of Pompey.
It is alleged that each of the contending parties made their presents also to the Proconsul him- self; Hyrcanus in particular, that of a beautiful piece of plate, admired for its workmanship and weight, being the model of a spreading vine, with its leaves and fruit in massy gold ; and such presents merit attention, as they furnilh some inltances of the manner in which great riches. now in so much request at Rome, were amafled by Roman officers in the course of their services. Be- fides what they obtained in this manner, it is likely that every conquest they effected, every revolution they brought about, and every protection they granted, was extremely profitable.
Pompey, on hearing the merits of the question between the two brothers, notwithstanding what his lieutenants had done for Ariftobulus, declared for Hyrcanus, and advanced towards the city of Jerusalem, to execute the decree he had passed. Upon his approach he was again met by Ariftobu- lus, who made fresh offers of fubmiflion, and of a public contribution in money; and Gabinius was detached, to take possession of the city, in terms of this submission. But upon a report that the
friencis I Joseph. Antiq. lib. xiv. c. z.
friends of Arifiobulus, though himself still in the H A P. hands of Pompey, refused to admit the Roman de- XV. tachment, this prince was put in arrest, and the whole army advanced to the walls.
The citizens being divided, those who espoused the cause of Hyrcanus prepared to open the gates of the city, while the others, who were attached to Ariftobulus, retired into the temple, and broke down the bridge by which this edifice was joined to the tfreets, and made every other preparation in that retreat to defend themselves to the last ex- tremity.
The Romans, upon the arrival of Pompey, bc- ing joined by the friends of Hyrcanus, took pof- session of all the principal stations within the walls, and prepared to attack the temple, into which their antagonifis had retired. This building had all the advantages of a citadel or fortess, built on a height, surrounded with natural precipices, or with a deep ditch overhung with lofty battlements and towers. To reduce it, Pompey sent for battering engines to Tyre, and cut down all the woods in the neighbourhood to furnish materials for the works he was about to erecd. All his attempts being, with great obstinacy, resifted by those who had taken refuge in the Temple. He observed, in the course of his operations, that the people within, although they at all times defended their own persons, when attacked, yet on the Sabbath- day they did no work, either in repairing any of
U 3 their
CH A p. their own .defences, in obfrucing or attempting
V to demolifli what the besiegers were ereting. He
accordingly took advantage of this circumstance, made no afiaults on that day, but continued his labour in filling up the ditch, and ereAed such works as were required to cover his approach. In this manner his towers, without interruption, were raised to the level of the battlements, and his en- gi;es playing from thence, made great havock an:!ilg the belieged. These devotees, however, animlated with zeal in defence of their Temple, even under the discharge of the enemy's misfiles, still continued at the altar to perform their usual ries; and took so little precaution against the dangers to which they were exposed, that num- bers perished in offering up the sacrifices, and mingled their blood with that of the vidtims.
In the third month after the siege began, one of the towers of the Temple was brought in ruin to the ground; and Fauflus, the son of Sylla, with two Centurions at the head of the divisions they commanded, entered the breach, and putting all whom they met to the sword, made way for more numerous parties to follow them, and covered the avenues and porches of the Temple with the slain. The priests, who were even then employed in the sacrifices, waited for the enemy with the utmost compoftire, and, without discontinuing their duties, were slain at the altars. Numbers of the people threw themselves from the precipices; and others, setting fire to the booths in which they had lodged !under the walls of the Temple, were consumed in
the
the flames. About twelve or thirteen thousand pe- c H A P.
XVI. rifhed on this occasion, without any proportional xo. loss to the besiegers, or to those who conduced the itorm.
Pompey, being master of the Temple, and struck with the obstinate valour with which it had been defended, had much curiolity to visit the interior recess, for the fake of which he was told that so much blood had been shed, and all his efforts with- stood with so much desperation. This place, into which no one was ever admitted, betides the high- priest, he supposed to contain the sacred emblems of that power who inspired his votaries with so ar- dent and so unconquerable a zeal. And he ven- tured, to the equal consternation and horror of his own party among the Jews, as of those who oppo- fed him, to enter with his usual attendance into the Holy of Holies. He found it adorned with lamps, candlesticks, cups, vessels of incense, with their supports, all of solid gold, containing a mars of the richest perfumes, and a sacred treasure of two thousand talents ,.
Having satisfied his curiosity, it is mentioned that he refpceed the religion of the place so much as to have left every part of this treasure untouch- ed, and to have given direCtions that the Temple itself should be purified, in order:to expiate the profanation of which he himself had been guil- ty. He reflored Hyrcanus to the priesthood or £overeignty of Judea, but charged him with a
U 4 considerable L Ab1put 1'.. 3S5,=:
cH A P. considerable tribute to the Romans, and at the * . , fame time stript the nation of all those possessions
or dependencies in Palestine and Celefyria, which had been acquired or held in fubjedion by their ancestors. Such were Gadara, Scythopolis, Hyp- pus, Pella, Samaria, Marissa, Azotus, Jamana, Are- thufa, Gaza, Joppa, and Dora, with what was then called Strato's Tower, and afterwards Cafarea. *Under pretence of restoring these several places to their liberties, they were released from their sub- jetion to the Jews, but in reality annexed to the Roman province of Syria '.
Pompey now recollecting that he had formerly carried his arms to the shores of the Atlantic, and to the boundaries of Numidia and of Spain; that he had recently penetrated to the coasts of the Euxine, and to the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea; in order that he might not leave any part of the known world unexplored by his arms, now formed a projet to finish this round of exploits, by visiting the shores of the Aliatic or Eastern Ocean: a circumstance which was to complete the glory of his approaching triumph, and raise him, as his flatterers were pleated to observe, to a rank a- bove every conqueror of the present or any prece- ding age '.
But while the Roman Proconsul was employed in the settlement of Syria, in the reduction of Jeru- falem, and meditating there farther conquefis, Mi-
thridates T Joseph. de Bell. Jud. lib. i. & vii. & Ant. lib. xiv. c. 6. Plut'arch. in Por1. p. 463,
thridates was busy in making preparations to re- c H A P. new the war. Having heard of the extremities to xv which the citizens of Rome had been frequently reduced by invasions from Gaul and Africa, and by the infurretions of their. own fubjeds and slaves, he concluded' that they were weakest at home, or might'be attacked with the greatest advantage in Italy.: He again, therefore, resumed the projet of marching an army of Scythians by the Danube and the Alps. He: visited all the princes in his neighbourhood, made alliances with many, which he confirmed by giving to some of them his daugh- ters in marriage, and persuaded them, by the hopes of a plentiful spoil, to join with him in the pro- jet of invading Europe. He even dispatched his agents into Gaul, to secure the co-operation of na- tions on that fide of the world, and trusted that, on his appearance in Italy, many of the difcon- tented inhabitants would become of his party, in the fame manner as they had declared for Hanni- bal; and that the slaves, so lately at open war with their masters, would likewise be a plentiful sup- ply of recruits to his army.
These projects, however, appeared to his own nation too hazardous and vast. They were suited to the state of a king who wished to perish with splendor; but not to that of fubjets and followers who had humbler hopes, and who chore to be go- verned by more reasonable profpeAs of fortune. The king himself, while he meditated such exten-. five designs, being confined by an ulcer in his face,
had
C H AP. had been for a considerable time concealed from
XVI -vi' public view, and had not admitted any petfon to
his pretence besides some favourite Eunuchs. The minds of his fubjecds, and of his own family in par- ticular, were much alienated from him by the late ats of barbarous severity against Machares and Xiphares, two of his own children, who, with some others, as we have mentioned, had incurred his re- fentment.
Pharnaces, another son, still attended the fa- ther; and, though disposed to betray him, was much in his confidence. The people of Phanagoria, a town on the shore of the Bosphorus, opposite to the fortress at which the king now resided, toge. ther with the inhabitants of the country, pretend- ing a variety of provocations, revolted and the army, during his confinement, losing the usual awe of his person- mutinied, and acknowledg- ed Pharnaces for king. They aflembled round the fcrtrefs in which Mithridates was lodged, and which he had garrisoned with a chosen body of men. When he appeared on the battlements, and desired to know their demands: " To exchange "' you," they said, " for Pharnaces ; an old king " for a young one." Even while he received this answer, and while many of his guards deserted him, he still hoped that, if he were at liberty, he might retrieve his affairs. He desired, therefore, by repeated messages, to know whether he might have leave to depart in safety? But none of the messen- gers he lent with this queflion being suffered to re-
turnr
turn, he apprehended that there was a design to CHAP. deliver him up into the hands of the Romans. XI. Under this apprehension he had recourse to his last resort, a dose of poison, which, it is said, he always carried for use in the scabbard of his fwvord. Being to apply this sovereign remedy for all his evils, he dismissed, with expressions of kindness and gratitude, such of his attendants as itill continued faithful to him; and being left with two of his daughters, who earnestly delired to die with their father, he allowed them to share in the draught, he had prepared and saw them ex- pire. But the portion which remained for himself not being likely to overcome the vigour of his con- ftitution, or, as was believed in those credulous times, being too powerfully counteracted by the es- fed of so many antidotes as he had taken against poison, he ordered a faithful slave who attended him, to perform with his sword what was in those times accounted the highest proof, as it was the last adt, of fidelity in a servant to his master.
Accounts of this event were brought to Pom- pey, while his army was encamped at the dif- tance of some days march from the. capital of Ju- dea, in his way to Arabia. The meflengers ap. peared carrying wreaths of laurel on the points of their spears; and the army, crowding around their general to learn the tidings, were informed of the death of Mithridates. This they received with acclamations, and immediately proceeded to nmake all the ordinary demonstrations of joy. Pom-
pey
c H A. pey himself, having now accomplished the prin-
XVI. cipal objeEt of the war, dropped his design on
Arabia, and direded the march of his army to- wards Pontus. Here he received the submission of Pharnaces, and, with many other gifts, was presented with the embalmed corpse of the king. The whole army crowded to fee it, examined the features and the scars, testifying, by these last es- feds of their curiosity, the refped which they en- tertained for this extraordinary man. He had, with ihort intervals, occupied the arms of the Ro- mans during forty years; and, though he could not bring the natives of Asia to match the legions of Rome, yet he frequently, by the superiority of his own genius, being firm in distress, rose from misfortune with new and unexpected re- sources. He was tall, and of a vigorous conftitu- tion, addicted to women, and, though superior to every other fort of fedution, to this his ardent and impetuous spirit made him a frequent and an easy prey. He appears to have loved and trusted many of that sex with a boundless passion. By some of them he was followed in the field; others he dif- tributed in his different palaces; had many chil- dren, and although, even towards his own sons, as well as towards every one else, on occasions which alarmed the jealousy of his crown, he was sanguinary and inexorable, yet in general he ap- pears to have entertained more parental affection than commonly attends the polygamy of Asiatic princes.
Pompey
Pompey proceeded to fettle the remainder of c A P. his conquests; and, belides the arrangements al- XV. ready mentioned, annexed the kingdom of Pontus to the province of Bithynia, gave the Bosphorus to Pharnaces, and put the province of Syria, extend- ing to the frontier of Egypt, under the govern- ment of Scaurus. He had now, from the time of his appointment to succeed Lucullus, for about three years, had the sole direction of the affairs of the Romans in Asia ; and had exchanged with the king of Parthia .provoking meflages, which, in a different conjuncure, might have led to im- mediate hostilities. But the circumitances were not yet ripe for such a measure, and Pompey had provided sufficient materials for a triumph, with- out attempting to eeak through those boundaries on which so many Roman generals were doomed to disappointment, and on which the progress of the empire itself was destined to stop.
Without entertaining any farther projects for the present, he set out with two legions on the route of Cilicia towards Europe, having Tigranes, ton to the king of Armenia, together with Arif- tobulus, late usurper of the Jewish throne, with his family, two sons and two daughters, as cap- tives to adorn his triumph .

Sb.A.u. began to run high against the ariftocratical party C!lbri. at Rome. The populace, led by some of the Tri-
bunes, were ever ready to insult the authority of the Senate; and the vices of particular men gave frequent advantages against the whole order of nobles. Corruption and dangerous fation pre- vailed at elecions, and the preferments of State were generally coveted, as fleps to the government .of provinces, where fortunes were amarfed by every species of abuse, oppression, and violence. Envy and indignation together concurred in rouiing the' L-. Corne- People againll these abuses. Cornelius, one of the EI- de ara- bitu. Tribunes, proposed a revere law against bribery,
by which persons convic'ted of this crime fllould be disqualified for any office whatever in the corn.
monwealth.
mncnwealth.. The Senate wished to soften the ri- H A P. gour of this law, by limiting the penalty to a pe- xI. cuniary fine; and the Consul, Calpurnius Pifo, moved for an edit to this purpose, in order to an- ticipate and to preclude the more violent law of Cornelius. But the Tribune prevailed, and ob- tained an ad imposing the feverer penalty. He likewise, by another decree of the People, attacked the discretionary jurifdidion of the Praetors ', obli- ged them to be more explicit in the edicts they published, and to observe them more exactly.
The crime of extortion in the provinces, how- ever, was the great disgrace of the Romans. To have found an effectual remedy for this evil, would have.done more honour'to the People than they had derived from all their conquefis. Severe laws were accordingly enacted, complaints were wil- lingly received, and prosecutions encouraged. Can- didates for popularity and public favour, generally began with endeavouring to bring some offender under this title to public justice; but the example of this State, after all, has left only this piece of inftrution to mankind; That just government over conquered provinces is fcarccly to be hoped for, and least of ail where republics are the conque- rors..
Manilius, one of the Tribunes of the People- in order to strengthen the inferior class of his confli- tuents, had obtained by surprise an acd A, by which the citizens of flaifhl extraction were to be pro-

c H A P. mifcuoufly inrolled in all the Tribes..' This ad,
,xv. having drawn upon him the,relfentment:of the Se-
nate, compelled him to seek for fecurity:under the protection of Gabinius aid Pompey. With this Lex Mani- view it was that he moved his famous ad, in which
Cicero concurred, to vest Pompey with the com- mand in Asia. This motion had procured him a powerful support, and on some occasions, raised the general voice of the People in his fayour. In- fomuch that soon after this tranfadtion,- being pro- fecuted for tome offence at the tribunal of Cicero, who was then Praxtor, and being refused the usual delays, the Praetor was obliged to explain this ftep in a speech to the People; in which he told them, that he adtually meant to favour Manilius, and that, his own term in office being about to expire, he could not serve him more effecually, than by hastening his trial, and by not leaving him in the power of a successor, who might not be equally disposed to acquit him. Such were the loose and popular notions of justice then prevailing, and the sacrifices made to party at Rome '.
At the eledtion of Consuls for the following year, there occurred an opportunity to apply the law against bribery. Of four candidates, Publius Autronius Petus, Publius Cornelius Sylla, L. Au- relius Cotta, and L. Manlius Torquatus, the ma- jority had declared for the former two; but there being convicted of bribery, were set aside, and their competitors declared duly elected.
About P Ilutarch. in Vit. Cicer.
About the fame time L. Sergius Catalina, who c I A P. has been already branded as the murderer of his X'vL own brother, under pretence of Sylla's profcrip- tions, having returned from Africa, where he had ierved in the quality of Praetor, and intending to fland for the Consulate, was accused of extortion in the province, and flopped in his canvas by a pro- Iecution raised on this account. In his rage for this disappointment, he was ripe for aly project of horror; and, being readily joined by Autronius and Pifo, the late disappointed candidates, formed a con- fpiracy to assassinate their rivals', to nlmalhcre the Senate, to seize the ensigns of power, and, with thc aid of their fadtion, to lay hold of the govern- ment :. Marcus Craflis and Caius Cefar, are men-. tioned by Suetonius as accefory to this plot. Craf- ifs was to have been named Dictator, and Cefari his general of the horse 3. Cifar was to have made a signal for beginning the nmaiEacre, by uncovering his shoulders of his gown ; but Crafils having wa- vered, absented himielf from the Senate, tild CaiTlr, though present, having made no iigual, the occa- lion pas'ed without the projected attempt.
This is the conipiracy ior which Publlus Sylla came to be tried as an accomplice, and \vwas de- fended by Cicero, in a pleading which is fill ex.. tant; whether Crallus and C. :lar, e;ing, accord- ing to Seutonius, implicated in the tfirli ifeps, tf- terwards broke off the conectiaon, may be quef- tioncd. But it is certain, thiit tlh plot was cair-

c i A P. ried on by the others to its full detection, ill the .. .. manner which remains to be told. The times in-
deed were pregnant with the feeds of extreme evil; many of those who, from their outset and profpeds, were deflined to run the political course, overwhelmed with the effets of prodigality and immnoderate expence in their suit to the People, incurred a ruin, which, if successful in their pre- tensions to office, was to be repaired by odious ex- pedients abroad, or, if disappointed, led them to projects of desperation and rage at home '.
The State appears to have apprehended an in- crease of tlhee evils from the number of foreigners, who, from every quarter, crowded to Rome as to the general resort of persons who wilfhed to indulge their own extravagance, or to prey upon, that of Texl' iapi. others. Under this apprehension, an edit was ob- de Pcrigr.L
i3. tained, upon the motion of C. Papius, Tribune of
the People, to oblige all firangers to leave the city : but it is lilkely, th-at the State was in greater danger from natives than foreigners. Cataline, having pre- vailed upon Ciodius, by the consideration of a fum of money, to drop the prosecution which had been commenced against him, was left to offer himself a candidate for the Consulate of the following year2.
The office of Censor had been revived in the perlons of Catulus and Craflus; but these officers found that its authority, so powerful in former times, was now greatly reduced. They scarcely ventured to give it a trial within the city; and, havin.' differed about the enrolment of citizens re-

tiding beyond the Po, and about fume other par- c 1 A P. ticulars, they resigned their power . Censors X'I.. were again named in the following year, but with no greater effect; some of the Tribunes, fearing to be themselves degraded from the Senate, put a negative on the usual funcdion of these officers in revising the rolls .
In the next Consulate, that of Lucius Julius Cr- u. c. 68,. far, and C. Marcius Figulus, Caius Cacfar, accu- c. '^lr. i- fed by Suetonius, as above, of hidden designs, but g'U. of whom we are from this time scarcely ever to lose fight, being now thirty-five years of age, entered on his career of popularity and ambition. It is remarked, that in his present Edilefihip, to- gether with Marcus Bibulus, not satisfied with the joint exhibition of public shews which were given to the People, at a common expence with his col- league, he gave separate entertainments on his own account. And destined, it Ihould seem, to be a thorn in the fide of those who were folicirous of public order, the gladiators he had aTenmblId on this occasion gave an alarm to the magiilracy, and he was ordered not to exceed a certain number. In his present office, or in that of 'Prctor, to which he was afterwards in course advanced, it is obfer- ved, that he took fiome iteps that were likely to revive the animosity of the late parties of Marius and Sylla; and, notwithitanding the a&t of indem- nity which had pafied, railed prosecutions, on a ch.arge of afatfination, againfl all those who had put any citizen to death in execution of Svlla's
X 2 prcfcrip-
c ii x r. proscription '. From this time Suetonius observes, .--,- . that Cicero, though it may be thought premature,
dated the beginning of his projet to subvert the republic, and to make himfelfmafter of.the State2.
What has most distinguished the present Con- fulate of Lucius Caesar, and Marcius Figulus, how- ever, is the competition of candidates for the fuc- ceflion to that office on the following year, and the consequences of the eletion which followed. The candidates were M. Tullius Cicero, C. Antonius, son of the late celebrated orator, L. Sergius Cata- lina, P. Sulpitius Galba, and L. Cassius Longinus, Quintus Cornificius, and Licinius Sacerdos.
Cicero was the first of his family who had ever resided, or enjoyed any honours, at Rome. He was a native of Arpinum, a country-town of Italy, and was confidered as an obscure person by those who were descended of antient families, but had great consideration on account of his eloquence and the consequences of it, to all such as had any interests at stake before the tribunals of juflice. Being solicited by Cataline to undertake his de. fence on a trial for malversation in Sicily, he did not at once rejet the request, nor always deny his aid to the factious Tribunes in support of their measures. He was undoubtedly, like other ambi- tious men at Rome, disposed to court every party, or to gain individuals 3; and had of late, in par-
ticular, I Su'ton, in Vit. C. J. Cefni is. ' . Ibid. c. ix. Suetonius ftlupofcs, that Cicero alluded to the confpiiacv o Auntroni::s and Sylla, in whlich Cra!it., as v.wll as C;rlcr, was :i!d to Tb eng . i i d.

ticular, considerably strengthened his interefl with c 1 A P. the People, by having ifupported the pretenlions of XvI. .their favourite Pompey, in having joined the po- pular Tribunes, in what they proposed in behalf of this aspiring citizen. He was, notwithftand- ing, probably by his aversion to appear for so bad a client as Cataline, saved from the reproach of having espoused his cause; and by his known in- clination in general to fuipport the authority of the Senate, he dilpofed the ariftocratical party to for- give the occasional part which he took with the Tribunes in particular questions, not immediately supposed to assec their ascendant in the State.
In the course of this competition fbr the Con- fulihip, Antonius and Cataline joined interefil to- gether, and spared no kind or degre.e of corrup- tion. Cicero complained of their practices in the Senate, and moved to revive the law of Calburni- us against bribery, with an additional penals-y of ten years banifhmentl. Cataline confidered this measure as levelled against himself; and incited by this provocation, as well as by the animosity of a rival, was then supposed to have formed a de- sign against Cicero's life, and to have expressed himself to this purpose, in terms that gave a gene- ral alarm to the electors, and determined gre: t numbers against himself. Hle had drawn to his in- terests many perfbns of infamous character and desperate fortune, many youths of good family, whom lie debauched or encouraged in their profli- gacy. His language, at their meetings, was all in-

c H A-'. dignation at the unequal and supposed unjufi di- XVII. .-^-_. ftribution of fortune and power. "Riches, au-
" thority and honour," he said, " are engrossed " by a few, while others of more merit are kept "in poverty and obscurity, or oppressed with "debts." He profelfed his intention, when in of- fice, to remove these grievances, to cancel the debts of his friends, to enrich them by plentiful divi- lions of land, and to place them in the flations of honour to which they were entitled.
Thcfe declarations, being made to numerous companies assembled together, could not be con- cealed. Curius, one of the fiacion, boafled to lFulvia, a woman of rank, with whom he had a criminal intrigue, that a revolution miuft soon take place, and specified the particular hopes and designs of their party. This woman men- tioned the fubjedq to her own confidents, but con. cealed the author of her information. Ln the mean time, Catalile was confidered as a person of the molt dangerous deligns, and was opposed in hi- election by all who had any regard to public or- der, or to the safety of the commonwealth. Ci- cero, at the fame time, being fiupported by the Se- nate, was elecccd, together with Caius Antoniuts The latter indeed flood candidate upon the fame interefl with Cataline, and wvas preferred to him only by a finall majority. r-. c. j y. By this event the designs of Cataline were sup-. C:ce. u posed to be fruflrated; but the Consuls were not :s.t'1h likely to enter on a quiet adminifIration. The Tri-
bunitia power', f-rom the time of its reflorationl
1V' .,
was gradually recovering its force, and extending c A:P. its operations. Every person that could give any , public disturbance, that could annoy the Senate, or mortify any of its leading members; every one that had views of ambition adverse to the laws, or who wished to take part in seenes of confusion and tumult; every person opprefled with debt, who withed to defraud his creditors; every.perfon who, by his profligacy or crimes, was at variance with the tribunals of justice, was comprehended under the general denomination of the popular party. The Roman People had once been divided into Pa- trician and.Plebeian, next into Noblemen and Com- moners; but now individuals took their fide with little regard to former diffincions againit or for the prcfervation of public order. In the assembly of the Centuries, as well as in that of the Tribes, the dif- orderly and the profligate began to prevail; and as it was impoflible that the colletive body of the People could meet in any fingie assembly, the co- mitia, for the most part, was but another name for such riotous tumults, as were made up of the per- sons who haunted the fireets of Rome. The minds of fober men were full of fear.and diftrufi, alarmed with formifes of plots, and various com- binations of desperate persons, who united their influence, not to carry elections or obtain pre- ferments, but to overturn the government, or to fiare in its spoils'.
One of the Tribunes of the prelcnt year, Scrvi- .ex Se.-. li.us Rullus, soon after his admillion into office, un- :i A.
X 4 .er I Cicero de Lcgr Ag.rara,
c H A P. der pretence of providing settlements for many of '~^. the citizens, promulgated the heads of an Agra-
rian Law, which lie carried to the Senate and the People. The subjed of former grants was now in a great mealfre cxhauftcd, and all Italy was inha- bited by the citizens of Rome. This Tribune proposed a new cxpecdient to provide for the indi- gent, not by conqueil, but by purchase. It was proposed, that all eilates, territories, or poiT-efions (o any forti which belonged to the republic, fhiould be solid that all acquisitions of territory recently made, and the spoils taken from any enemy, fiould be difpofec of in the fame manner, that the mo- ney arising from fitch sales fliould be employed in. purchasing arablc and cultivable lands, to be as- iigned in lots to the nccefiitous citizens; and that, to carry this law into execution, ten commifiioners ilhould be named in the fame manner in which the Pontiffs were named, not by the whole People, but by fcventeen of the Tribes felcrced by lot: that these commitlioners should be judges, without ap- peal, of what was or was not public property; of what was to be fold, of swhat was to be bought, and at what price; that they were to receive and to judge of the accounts of every Consul, or other officer, except Pompey, commanding in any pro- vince, whcre any capture had been made, or new territory acquired and in fliort, that they should, during five years, which was the intended term as their conmminion, be the sole masters of all pro-
perty
perty within the empire, whether public or pri- c i A r.
XVII. vate. VI-.
On the day that the new Consuls entered oi their office, when they returned in proceflion from the Capitol, and gave the first meeting to the Se- nate, Rullus had the presumption to propose this law, and to move the Conscript Fathers, that they would be pleased to give it the sanction of their approbation and authority in being carried to the People. Upon this occasion, Cicero made his firlt speech in the charater of Consul. The former part of it is loft; the remainder may be reckoned among the highest specimens of his eloquence. In. this and the two speeches he delivered to the Peo- ple, on the fame subjea, he endeavoured to demon- firate, (if we may venture to imitate the profusion of his own expreflions) that, from the first clause of this law to the last, there was nothing thought of, nothing proposed, nothing done, but the erec- ing in ten perfbns, under the pretence of an Agra- rian Law, an abfoiute sovereignty over the trea- fury, the revenue, the provinces, the empire, the neighbouring kingdoms and 'states; and, in short, over all the world as fir as it was known to the Romans. He painted in flch lively colours the abuses which might be committed by Rullus, and by his associates, in judging what was private and what public property, in making tales, in making purchases, in planting the colonies; and to expo- fed the impudence of the cheat, by which it was propeofd to firprife the People into the granting
of

rejc(ted, and its author hissed from the aflembly, and treated as an object of ridicule and scorn.
The splendour of the Consul's eloquence, on this occasion, appeared with great difiincion, and the spirit of the times continued to furnish lim with opportunities to display it '. Roscius Ame- rinus, having been Tribune of the People a few years before, had, by the authority of his office, set apart some benches in the theatre for the Equef- trian order. This gave offence to the People, so that Roscius was commonly hissed when he appear- ed at any of the public assemblies. On some one of these occasions the Consul interposed; and, in a popular harangue, secured the attachment of the Knights to himself, and even reconciled the People to the diftindtion which had been made in favour of that body.
There happened under the fame Consulate a business of greater difficulty, being a motion to re- store the sons of the proscribed to the privilege of being chosen into the ofices of State, of which they h:Ad becn deprived by an ordinance of Sylla. Their fate was undoubtedly calamitous and severe. Many of them who had been too young to -have incurred the guilt of their party, were now come of age, and found themselves tlript of their birth-

right, and fligmatized with this mark of diflho- c A P. nour. It was proposed, in their behalf, to take ., away this cruel exclusion. But Cicero, appre- hending that this proposal tended to arm and to strengthen persons, who, from long use, had con- traated an habitual difaffedion to the eflablifined government at Rome, powerfully opposed the mo- tion, and succeeded in having it rejeced '.
Though the orations on the two filbjects last men- tioned have perished, great part of that which he spoke on the trial of C. Rabirius still remains. This man, of a great age, a refpedable Senator, after an interval of six-and-thirty years, was brought to trial as an accomplice in the death of Apuleius Saturninus, the factious Tribune, who, as has been related, having seized the Capitol, was, by the Con- fuls Marius and Valerius Flaccus, adcing under the authority of the Senate, and attended by all the most refpedable citizens in arms, forced from his firong-hold, and put to death as a public enemy.
Titus Atius Labienus, one of the Tribunes, was the declared prosecutor of C. Rabirius; but his- torians agree, that this Tribune aded at the infti- gation, and under the diredion, of C. Crefar. The intention of the popular party was, by making an example of this rei'ecdable person in so strong a cafe, where the authority of the Senate, and the commands of the most popular Consul, where even the prescription of so old a date fimnold have re- pelled every danger, cfTedunlly, for the future,' to

C HA p. deter every person from ading in support of the
:vI. Senate, or fiom lending any force or opposition to
the designs of factious Tribunes, however turbu- lent or dangerous.
The Senate, and all the friends of established authority, were greatly alarmed, and united in de- fence of Rabirius. The popular party, as already described, the ambitious, the profligate, the bank- rupt, who were carneft to weaken the hands of government, and in haste to bring on scenes of confusion and trouble, took the opposite fide.
The prosecutor laid his charge for treason of the moll heinous nature, which must have led the convided, though a freeman, to die on the cross, the ordinary manner of executing the sentence of death on slaves. " The executioner stalks in the <' forum," said Cicero, " and the cross is erected " for a Roman citizen in the field of Mars." The accusation was first broughrt before the Praetor, who poffeired the ordinary jurifdidion in such cafes. And this magistrate empannelled two jud- ges, who w ere to determine in this mighty cause. These were Caius Julius and Lucius Caesar. At this court the defendant was condemned; and with appearances of animosity on the part of Caius Cafar, that greatly increased the public alarm. This rising citizen had always courted the popu- lace, and was strongly supported by them. That he Ihould aim at honours and power, it was said, is common; but that he wished to provide impu- nity for the lifturbers of the commonwealth, was
dreadful.
dreadful. The crime of Rabirius, even if he could c H A P. be convieted of it, had been committed the year . xl before Caesar was born. In the person of the ac- cufed every circumflance, even on the ftppofition of a true charge, pleaded for compaflion, and even for refpea : the fa(t, at the fame time, was denied, and a positive evidence was brought, that another had received a reward for killing Saturninus: but the policy of the facrion required this victim; and the sentence must have been executed, if the coni- demned had not fled, by appeal, to the judgment of the People, where indeed his caufc might be reckoned more desperate than it had been before a felet court. The parties attended this trial with great ardour. Hortenfius conducted the ap- peal and defence. Cicero pleaded in behalf of justice and government; painted the age, the in- firmities, the forlorn itate of the defendant, who had survived his relations and his friends. He pointed out the danger to government and to or- der from this precedent, in terms that must have melted every heart, not callous from ambition, ifac- tion, or profligacy of manners : but in vain. Even in the assembly of the Centuries, the m:jority was hastening to affirm the fentencc, when Q: Caeci!ius Metellus Celer, then Prnetor, and one of the Au- gurs, haflened to the Janiculum, and tore down the ensign which was planted there as a i!,;n of peace.

c }I A P. itrain. This form took its rife, as has been for-
m erly mentioned 1, in the firit ages of Rome, when the enemy inhabiting villages in the neighbour- hood were supposed at the gates, and the people convened in the field on one lide of the city might be assailed on the other. When the Centuries were formed, therefore, in the field of Mars, a guard was always posted on the Janiculum, and an ensign displayed. If any enemy appeared, the ensign was taken down, the aflembly dismissed, and the People took to their arms. This ceremo- ny, like many other cufloms both of superstition and law, remained after the occasion had ceased; and it was held illegal or impious in the People to proceed in any affair without the ensign in view. By this means the trial of Rabirius was put off, and the prosecutors, despairing of being able to work up the People again into an equal degree of violence, dropt the prosecution. The cause still remained undecided, and the power of the Senate, to defend its own authority, continued in a slate of flu^pence.
The Tribune Labienus laid aside thoughts of renewing this invidious prosecution, in order to pursue the object of some other more popular ads; one in particular, to repeal the almost only remain- ing ordinance of Sylla; that which conferred on the College of Priefls the power of filling up va- cancies in their own order. The right of election was again taken from the college, and, according
to 1 sCLd vol. i. c. 1.
tothe law of Domitius, given to seventeen of the C.H A '. Tribes, who were to be drawn by lot. This change X_ . was intended to open the way of Caius Caesar into that office; and he was accordingly promoted to it in the following year.
Others of the Tribunes likewise endeavoured to distinguish themselves by ads of turbulence and sedition. Metellus Nepos endeavoured to re- peal that clause of the ad against bribery and cor- ruption, which declared the party conviced to be disqualified for any of the offices of State. This Tribune, though sufficiently disposed to diibrderly courses, had many connections among the molt refpedtable citizens, and was persuaded, in this instance, to drop his design.
But of all the cabals into which the popular fation was distributed, none was more desperate, nor supposed more dangerous, than that of Cata- line, the late disappointed candidate for the Con- fulfhip. His rival Cicero had intimation, before the elections, of a design formed by this desperate party against his own person, and still continued to observe their motions. For this purpose he en- tered into a correspondence with a woman of the name of Fulvia, already mentioned, and who had given the first hints of a dangerous conspiracy ; by means of this woman, he procured the confi- dence of Curius, who gave him minute informa- tion of all the proceedings of the party.

to divert his colleague from this dangerous con- nesion, made him every concession. Having, in casting lots for the provinces of Gaul and Mace- donia, drawn the latter, which was thought to be: preferable, he yielded it up to Antonius; and by this, and every other means in his power, perfua- ded him to reft on the secure pofleflion of dignities and honours, lawfully obtained, in preference to expeAations formed on the projets of a few def- perate men.
In secret, Cataline encouraged his adherents by pretending to have many resources, and to be sup- ported by numbers who were ready to take arms at his command. In a formal meeting of his par- tv in Otober, a few days before the Consular elections, he opened the whole of his design; and in the speech which he made on that occasion, is said to have used expressions to the following pur- port: " The distressed can rely for relief on those
only who have a common cause with them-
! selves. Whoever is at ease in his own fortune, '' will not regard the suffering of others. If yotu ·' would know how I fiand affected to the parties ·( which now divide the republic, rich creditors, "and needy debtors, please to confider, what every ( one knows, that I have no safety but in the de-
f triuction of the one, and in the relief of the " otler: that my intercft is the fame with your own,
" and
' and that I have courage to attempt what may be c H A P. t' necessary for our common relief and-fecurity." L-
From the Itrain of this passage, the description *of a party'to whom it was with propriety addref- fed, may be easily collected. Cicero, who had frequently taxed Cataline with dangerous designs, .now determined' to lay the whole of his intelli- gence before the public; and for this purpose de- ferred the Consular elections, which were to have been held on the eighteenth of Otober, to a fu- ture day, and assembled the Senate. Cataline hav- ing, with the other members, attended, and hear- ing the charge, did not pretend to deny or to pal- liate his words. " There are," he said, "i in this " republic, two parties; one weak both in its
members and head; the other strong in its ' members, but wanting a head: while I have "the honour of being ftupported by this party, it " shall have a head." Upon these words, a gene- ral cry of indignation arote in the Senate; but no resolution was taken. Many, who were there present as members, were pleased to fee the Senate itself insulted; and Cataline, as if in condition to brave all his enemies, was, in all his expressions, .equally unguarded in the fireets and in the Se- nate. To Cato, who, in the public Forum, some days before this meeting, had threatened to have him impeached: " Do," he said; " but if you
light a flame in my fortunes, I will extinguifit ( it under the ruins of the commonwealth '."

c HA. A prosecution was actually raised against him xvn. in the name of Lucius Paulus, a young man of
diftinaion, for carrying arms against the public peace. On this occasion, however, he thought proper to soften his tone, and offered to submit to voluntary confinement, until his innocefnce filould be made to appear. " Np one," he said, "( who
knows my rank, my pretensions, and the interest I " have in the preservation of the commonwealth, " will believe, that its deftrution is to be apprehen- " ded from me, and that its safety is to come from " a native of Arpinum ." He offered to commit himself to the custody of Cicero, of Metellus, or of any other magistrate, till this injurious asper- sion were removed. To this offer the Consul re- plied, That he who did not think himself safe within the fame ramparts with Cataline, would not receive him into his house2.
By one effec of the unparalleled licence enjoy- ed by citizens of Rome, persons accused of the noft heinous crimes were at large, during the de- pendence of their trial, and might either proceed in the execution of their designs, or withdraw from justice. Such was the effet of the laws of Valerius and Porcius, which secured against violence, or the power of the magistrate, the person of every citizen, however accused, until he were finally condemned by the People. In support of this privilege, which was salutary, when the abuse of power in the ma-
giftrate X The town of which Cicero vwas native. , Ccro I n C.ta'.na.m, i. c. A,
giftrate was more to be dreaded than the licence c H A P. of crimes in the subjed, the Romans periifted even _ . after the depravity of manners was become too strong for the laws, and when exemption from every just restraint was fatally mistaken for liberty. The State had now been thrown, on many occa- sions, into the most violent convulsions, because there was not any regular method of reflling dif- orders, or of suppressing them on their firtl appear- ance.
Cataline, soon after the elections, at which, by the preference given to his competitors Murena and Silanus, he received a fresh disappointment in his hopes of the Consulship, sent Mallius, or Man- lius, an experienced soldier, who had served with himself under Sylla, to prepare for an insurrection in the diftrid of Etruria. This officer, in the end of October, under pretence of giving refuge to debtors from the opprefiion of their creditors, had actually afembled a considerable body of men '. Suspicions at the fame time arose againit Publius Sylla, who was making a large purchase of gla- diators at Capua, and infurredions were appre- hended on the fide of Campania and Apulia. In this slate of affairs, continual informations being brought of Cataline's designs, the Senate gave in charge to the Consuls to watch over the safety of the State; and these officers accordingly put chosen bodies of men under arms, and secured all the posts of consequence in the city. Metellus, the conqueror of Crete, who still remained without

c 1 A P. the walls in hopes of a triumph, was appointed to i __, command on the fide of Apulia. The Prxtor Me-
tellus Celer was sent into the Cisalpine Gaul, in order to secure the peace of that province'; and the Consul Antonius was destined to suppress the infurreftion of Mallius at Fasfulae .
Cataline mean while remained in the city, and had frequent consultations for the arrangement and the execution of his plot. At a meeting of the party, held in the beginning of November, in the house of M. Porcius Lecca3, a general massacre of the principal Senators was projected. The con- fpirators severally chose their flations, and under- took their several parts. Two in particular, who were familiar in Cicero's house, undertook in the morning, under pretence of a visit, to surprise and assassinate the Consul. But he being the fame night apprised of his danger by Fulvia, gave the proper orders, and the intended aflaffins, upon their appearance at his door, were refused admit- tance. He immediately after assembled the Senate in the temple of Jupiter. Cataline presented him- self with his usual presumption; and Cicero; as appears from an oration which he then delivered, instead of laying the. matter in form before the Senate, accofled Cataline in a vehement invective, *rging him to be gone from the city, where all his itceps were minutely observed, where his meaning .vas understood, and precautions taken against all
his Cicero in Cat. i. c. iz. 2 Now' Florcnce, - C: 'rrn uoro b S-la;, c. iO.
his designs. " I told you," said the Consul, " that c n A P. "your emiflary Mallius would be in arms by the xVI "first of November; that you intended a mafiacre "of the Senators about the fame time. I now re- "peat the memorable words you made use of ' when you were told, that many of the Senators "had withdrawn from the city. You ihould be " satisfied, you said, with the blood of those who "remained. Were you not surrounded, hemmed " in, and beset on every fide by the guards posted ' to watch you? Did your intention to furprifc "Prsnefte, on the night of the first of November, "escape me? Did you not find precautions taken " that implied a knowledge of your design ? There "is nothing, in flort, that you do, that you pre- "pare, that you meditate, which is not heard, " which is not seen, which is not felt by me in " every circumstance. What of last night? Were " you not at the house of Porcius Lecca? Deny "it! I have evidence. There are here present
persons who were of your company. But where "are we? What manner of government or re- "public is this ? The enemies and destroyers of "the commonwealth make a part in its highest "councils! We know them, and yet they are iss- "sered to live ! But, be gone. The time of en- "during you is pall. The world is convinced of "your guilt. Stay only till there is not a lingle " person that can pretend to doubt of it; till your " own partizans must be silent, and till the cla-
mour, which they would willingly raise againfl
Y , " every
c i AP. . " every necefihry at of government, be fuppref- XVII. " fed."
This being the general tendency of the Consul's speech, fraught with such alarming matter, and Urged with so much confidence, the audience was seized with terror, and numbers, who happened to be on the fame bench with Cataline, withdrew from his fide. He himself arose, and attempted to vindicate his character, but was silenced with a general cry of indignation; upon which he left the Senate; and, after concerting farther measures with those of his party, not thinking that a longer stay in the city could be of any use to his affairs, he withdrew in the night, leaving letters behind him to some of the Senators, in which he com- plained, that, by a combination of his enemies, he was driven into exile; and that, rather than be the occasion of any disturbance in the commonwealth, he was willing to retire. While these letters were handed about in the city, he took his way, preced- ed by the uflers and ensigns of a Roman Procon- ful, straight for the camp of Mallius, and entered into a Rate of open war. The features of this man's portrait are possibly exaggerated by the vehement pencils and lively colourings of Cicero and of Sallust. He is represented as able to endure hardships of any kind, and as fearless in any dan- ger; as, from his youth, fond of discord, afaflina- tions, and bloodshed; as fained with the blood of his own brother, whom he murdered to have his estate, and with the blood of his own child,
whom
whom he murdered, to remove the objection made c H A P. to him by a woman who refused to marry him with xv_. the profpeEt of being a step-mother. He is repre- sented as rapacious, prodigal, gloomy, impetuous, unquiet, dissembling, and perfidious; a description, of which the horrors are probably amplified: but for which it cannot be doubted there was much foundation, as he far exceeded in profligacy and desperation all those who, either in this or the for- mer age, were, by their ambition or their vices, hastening the ruin of the commonwealth.
Cicero always professed to have particular in- formation of the progress of Cataline. This, ac- cording to Sallust, he owed to Fulvia, by whose means he obtained a correspondence with Curius; but he himself, in none of his orations, gives any intimation of the manner in which he obtained his intelligence. It is probable that Curius desired to be concealed, that he might not be expoied to the rage of the conspirators as an informer and a traitor. On this account the Consul, although he was minutely apprised of particulars, was obliged to adopt the plan he had hitherto followed, to urge the conspirators themselves into open hostilities, and into a full declaration of their purpose. He had succeeded with refpea to Cataline; but his accomplices were yet very numerous in the city, and were taking their measures to co-operate with those who were in arms abroad.
In this state of affairs Fabius Sanga, a Roman citizen of distinCtion, came to the Consul, and in-
Y 4 formed
c H A P. formed him, that the ambafadors of the Allobro- ..- ~ ges, a people then inhabiting what is now called
the territory of Geneva, and part of Savoy, whose patron he was, had made him privy to a very mo- mentous affair; that, upon being disappointed in a suit, on which they had been employed to the Se- nate, they had been carried by P. Umbrenus to'Pub- ius Cornelius Lentulus the Pretor, who condoled with them on the fubje& of the wrong they had re- ceived, allured them of redress if they would merit the favour of those who were soon to' have the as- cendant at Rome-; and proposed, that they should immediately, upon their return to their own coun- try, prevail on their nation to be prepared with an army, to co-operate with their friends in Italy. Ci- cero immediately laid hold of this intelligence, as afiording means tobring the plot to light, in a proper manner, and with sufficient evidence, to convict the conspirators. Hie desired Sanga to encourage this correspondence; to advise the ambassadors to re- quire proper credentials to be shown to their coun- trymen; to procure a lift of the Roman citizens who, in cafe they fiould rife in rebellion against the Romans, were to become bound to protet them; and when they fiould be thus provided, and about to depart, lie infIrudted Sanga to bring him inti- mll:t-ion of tlheir motions, that they might be fecu- red, with their writings, and other evidence of the facts to be ascertained. Sanga, having inftruded the amblalfadors accordingly, gave notice of their
- ~ - .nmotion's
motions to the Consul. In the evening before they c H A P. were to depart, Cicero ordered the Praetors, L. , Flaccus and C. Pontinus, to march by different ways, and in small parties, after it was dark, to place a sus- ficient armed force to intercept the ambafiadors of the Allobroges. The parties were stationed on different fides of the river, at the bridge called Milvius, without knowing of each other, and with- out having any suspicion of the purpose for which they were posted, farther than arose from their having been told, that they were to seize any per- ibn who fliould attempt to pass in either direcion. About three o'clock in the morning the ambaffa- dors from the Roman fide entered on the bridge with a numerous retinue; and being challenged, and commanded to stop by the party that was pla- ced to intercept them, they endeavoured to force their way; and some blood was fled. But on the appearance of the Prators, with their ensigns of office, the travellers ceased to resist. Their dif- patches were secured. Volturcius, a Roman citi- zen, who was found in their company, was taken and searched. Letters were found upon him, in different hands, and under different feals, address- ed to Cataline. These, together with the pri- ibners, were immediately carried back to the city.
The Consul being apprised of the success which attended this part of his design, sent, before any alarm could be tt.ken by the party, meflages to Gabinius, Statilius, Cethegus, and Lentulus, dell- ring to fee them at his own house. The three for-
ellwr
c H A P. mer came with the messenger; but Lentulus was x..I., newly gone to bed, and, by his delay, gave some
cause to fufped that he was aware of his danger. He too, however, came before it was day; and the house of Cicero was presently crowded, not only with numbers of the Equestrian order that were in arms for the defence of his person, but likewise with many Senators whom he desired to be present. The ambassadors of the Allobroges, now prisoners, were likewise conducted thither, and the letters found in their possession, were produced unopen- ed. Cicero declared his intention to assemble the Senate without delay, in order to lay the whole matter before them. Many of the company were of opinion, that the letters should be first opened, in order to fee, whether they contained any matter of so much moment, as to require assembling the Senate, at a time when so, great an alarm was like- ly to be taken. Cicero, however, having no doubt of the contents of the letters, and of the import- ance of the matter, over-ruled those scruples, and the Senate was accordingly called. Mean time the Allobroges dropt some expreflions which im- plied, that some arms were concealed in the house of Cethegus. This occasioned a search being then made, and a considerable quantity of daggers and swords were accordingly found.
At the meeting of the Senate, Volturcius was first examined; he denied his knowledge of any treasonable designs, but appeared disconcerted; and, upon being reminded of the reward that had
been
been offered for the discovery of any plot against c A P. the State, and of the danger to which he himself x-_ would be exposed in prevaricating, he confefled, that the letters seized in his custody were sent by the Praetor Lentulus and others: that he had be- fides a verbal message to Cataline, informing him, that the plan was now ready for execution; that the station of every person was assigned; that some were appointed to set fire to the city in different places, and some to massacre their enemies in the midst of the confusion that was likely to be occa- sioned by the fire; and desiring that Cataline, in order to support his friends, and to profit by the diversion they were to make in his favour within the walls, should isue a proclamation to arm the slaves, and that he himself should march directly to Rome.
The deputies of the Allobroges being next in- troduced, acknowledged, that they had been char- ged by Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, and Cassius, with assurances of support to the council of their nation, confirmed by oath, accompanied with di reftions to march, without delay, a body of horse into Italy, where they ihould be joined by a nu- merous infantry, and receive proper infirusions in what manner they should farther proceed: that, to encourage them, Lentulus quoted a prophecy, found in the collecion of the Sibyls, by which he himself was pointed out as the third of the Cor- nelii' destined to arrive at the sovereignty of Rome:

The supposed conspirators were next called in their turns; and the letters, with the feals unbro- ken, were exhibited before them. Cethegus, being the first examined, perfilled in denying his know- ledge of any conspiracy; accounted for the arms which were found in his house, by laying, He was curious of workmanflip of that nature, and always bought what he liked. He preserved his counte- nance undisturbed, till his own letter was produ- ced, and then fell into great confusion, as the feal was immediately known to be his.
Lentulus next, with great confidence, denied the charge; affected not to know either Voltur- cius or the ambassadors; asked them upon what occasion they ever could pretend to have been ad- mitted into his house? He, however, supposing that nothing in the contents of the letter that was now produced could convict him, acknowledged the feal. It was the head of his grandfather. But the letter being opened, was found to be unligned, and in the following general terms " The bear- "er will inform you who I am. Fear nothing.
Remember whlere you tand; and neglec no- "thing. Call in every aid, even the meaneit." While he persisted in his denial, uome one asked him, If he had never quoted the Sybilline oracles

Gabinius too was at last brought to own his guilt; and in this manner the conspiracy was ful- ly laid open. Lucius Caesar, the Consul of the for- mer year, in the presence of Lentulus, whojwas married to his sifter, gave his opinion, that this un- happy man ihould be immediately put to death. " This," he said, " is no unprecedented mea, " sure. My grandfather, Fulvius Flaccus, taken in " open rebellion as this man is, was slain by
order of the Consul Gabinius. His son was ta- "ken into custody and put to death in prison." In the mean time Lentulus was ordered to diveit himself of the office of Prastor, and, together with his accomplices, was committed to close imprison- ment. This Cornelius Lentulus was distinguished by the addition of Sura to his name. He had been Consul about eight years before, and was after- wards, for his debaucheries, struck off the rolls of the Senate. He had now again condescended to ac- cept of the office of Prctor, in order to recover, in the capacity of a magistrate, his feat in the Senate.
A proclamation was issued to apprehend M. Cae- parius, who had been sent to procure an infurredion. in Apulia, together with P. Furius, Magius Chilo, and P. Umbrenus, who had first introduced the Gaulifi ambassadors to Gabinius. The Senate voted thanks to the Confil Cicero for his great vi- gilance, and for the confuimmate ability he had ih':vn in the difcovcrv and fuppreflion of this
trcafonable
CHA P. that the conspirators had differed about. the time
of executing their design. Lentulus was of opi- nion it should be deferred to the holy-days in De- cember; that Cethegus, notwithitanding, and the others, were impatient, and desired a nearer day.

He preserved his counte- nance undisturbed, till his own letter was produ- ced, and then fell into great confusion, as the feal was immediately known to be his.

He had now again condescended to ac- cept of the office of Prator, in order to recover, in the capacity of a magistrate, his feat in the Senate.
A proclamation was issued to apprehend M. Ca- parius, who had been lent to procure an infurrecion in Apulia, together with P. Furius, Magius Chilo, and P. Umbrenus, who had firIt introduced the Gaulifi ambassadors to Gabinius. The Senate voted thanks to the Consul Cicero for his great vi- gilance, and for the consummate ability he had ihc:vn in the difcovcry and fupprefflion of this
treasonable
C H A r. treasonable design ; to the Prators, for the faithful xvm execution of the Consul's orders; and to Anto-
nius, his colleague, for having detached himself from men with whom he was known to have been formerly conneced. A public thanksgiving to the gods was likewise decreed in honour of the Con- ful, and in consideration of this deliverance of the city from fire, of the People from massacre, and of Italy from devaflation and war.
An assembly of the People being called, Cicero gave this account of the proceedings of the Se- nate, in a speech which is still extant ', and early on the following day assembled that body again, to deliberate on the farther resolutions to be taken with refped to the prisoners. An agent had been busy in the night to raise some disturbance in fa- vour of Lentulus; but the design of setting fire to the city gave so great an alarm, that not only such as were pofeffed of considerable property, but every inhabitant, whatever might be his effects, trembled for his own person, and for the safety of his house. The avenues to the Senate, the Capitol, the Forum, all the Temples in the neighbourhood, by break of day, were crowded with armed men. The Consul had summoned the Equestrian order in arms to support the government, and citizens of every rank came forth to have a part in what might be required for the safety of their families.
When the Senate was assembled, the members differed in their judgment. Junius Silanus, one of the Confuls-eleCt, being called up first in order, de-
clared r In Cat. 3.
dared himself for a sentence of death. Tiberius c H A P. Nero differed from him, and proposed perpetual xvn. imprisonment. The majority, however, joined Si- lanus, until Caius Cxefar spoke. This able advo- cate declared against the opinion of Silanus, not as too revere, but as contrary to law; and infified on the danger of a precedent which might set the life of every citizen at the mercy of a vote in the Senate. Death, he said, was the common deftina- tion of all men; what no one could avoid, and what the wife frequently coveted. It was not, therefore, to be used as a punishment; and he was disposed, in this cafe, not to mitigate, but to increase, the feve- rity of the sentence. He proposed, therefore, that the eflates of the prisoners fliould be confiscated; that their persons Ihould be committed for life to the keeping of the most secure and best affected corporations in Italy; and that it fliould be de- clared treason for any one hereafter to move the Senate or the People for any mitigation of their punishment.
Cafar might be confidered as appearing on the fide of the popular faction, and as laying the ground upon which the proceedings of the Senate, and the conduc of any particular member, might be afterwards arraigned before the People. The terrors of the Porcian and Sempronian laws, when likely to be urged by so powerful an advocate, alarmed the greater part of the Senate. Silanus himself retracted his opinion. In this fludation the Consul submitting the quefion to the judge-
ment
c H A P. ment of the Senate, for his own part declared his ·x VL willingness to execute any decree they should form.
He treated Caesar with great refpeat, and with some art laid hold of the severe terms in which this po- pular citizen had spoken of the conspiracy, as a pledge of his future condu6t, in cafe the proceedings of government, with respect to the matter now be- fore them, ihould hereafter be questioned or brought under review. " The Senate," he observed, " had "no cause to dread the imputation of cruelty. It "was mercy to prevent, in the most effectual man- "ner, a crime to be perpetrated in so much blood. ' If this crime were not prevented, they were to
fee that city, the resort of nations, and the light " and ornament of empire, perish at one blow.
They were to fee heaps of her citizens unbu- "ried, and lying in their blood: they were to fee ' the fury of Cethegus let loose in murder; to
fee Lentulus become a king, Cataline command- " ing an army, and every where to hear the cries " of mothers, to fee the flight of children, and the " rape of virgins.-If the father of a family," he continued, " should spare a slave who had shed "the blood of his children, who had murdered " his wife, and set fire to his dwelling, how flould " such a father be confidered-as cruel, or as void "of affecion ?
" He desired them not to regard what was given " out, of their not being in condition to attempt ·' any thing vigorous against there men. He him- " self, as first magistrate, had not neglected the
" neceflary
' necefiary precautions; and the general ardour c HAP. " with which all ranks of men concurred in the xv. ' defence of their families, their properties, and "the feat of empire, rendered every resolution
they could take secure of the utmost effect. The "forum is full, all the temples in its neighbour-
hood are full, all the fireets and avenues to this " place of assembly are full of citizens of every " denomination, armed for the defence of their " country. But he requested that the Senate " would issue their orders before the fun went "down, and seemed to apprehend dangerous con- " sequences, if these matters were left undeter- ' mined, and the city exposed to the accidents ' of the following night. For himself, he pro- " sessed to have taken his resolution. Although " he felt the occasion full of perolnal danger, he " would execute the orders of the conscript fa- "thers," he said ; but, if he fell in the attempt,
implored their protection for his wife and his "children I."
All this appears to have passed in debate before Cato spoke. This virtuous citizen, then about thirty-three years of age, had, in the former part of his life, taken a very different course from the youths of his own time, and, both by his temper and education, was averse to the libertine princi- ples which had crept into .the politics and the manners of the age. He spoke chiefly in answer to Caius Caxfar, who, he observed, seemed to mif-

c H A P. take the question. " We are not enquiring," he xL. said, " what is the proper punifliment of a crime
"already committed, but how we may defend the "republic from an imminent danger with which
it is threatened. It is proposed to fend the pri- f' loners to iafe keeping in the country. Why "' into the country ? Because perhaps the faction "of profligate citizens is more numerous in Rome, " and mty rescue them. Is Rome the only plaee ' to which profligate men may resort, or are pri- ' toners of State most secure where the force of -' government is least? This proposal is surely an " idle one, if the author of it professes to entertain " any fear of these men. But if, in this general ' alarm of all the city, he anrd such persons be not "afraid, so much the more cause have we to be ' on our guard. We are beset with enemies, " both within and without the walls. While Ca- ' taline with fire and fvord- is hastening to your ' gates, you hesitate, whether you will cut off or ' spare his associates, who are taken with the torch "in their hands and the dagger at your breast ! " You muff firike those who are now in your " power, if you mean to intimidate those who are * coming to support their designs. The remiss- ' nets or the vigour which you now flow, will * be felt in the camp of Cataline, and will be at- * tended with suitable effects. I am therefore of
opinion, that we order these men, agreeably to ' the nrapdice which our ancestors have followed
" in
" in all cafes of treason and of open war againlt c I A 1 "the commonwealth, to immediate death." . XV
Such is said to have been the speech of Cato, by which the Senate was determined in the very momentous resolution which was taken on the present occasion; and however little we may be inclined to confider fuich compositions in many parts of ancient history as records of fad, much credit is due to this representation, as it is given by a person who himself became a partizan of Cxe- far, and as the words which he ascribed to these speakers muff have come in the perusal of his work under the infpecion of many who were present to the delivery of them'. The execution of the prisoners was accordingly determined, and Cor- nclius Lentulus, in the beginning of the follow- ing night, was, by order of the Consul, committed to a vaulted dungeon under ground, and firangled. His accomplices had the fame fate; and the minds of men, though somewhat quieted of their fears, were nevertheless fiunned with the scene, and be- held with amazement a Patrician of the Cornelian family, of the first rank in the commonwealth, who himself had been Consul, suffering, without any formal trial, by the hands of the common es-. ecutioner ofjuftice .
Z 2 While i T'I'e mre credit is due to this account of Crefar's and of Cato's speech, tjiat the fpecch which is ascribed to Cicero by the fame hiftori:n, is a faithful extrad, or contains the piu;port of the oration which flill remains ::mo;lg his works.

c H1 A P. While there thirgs were in agitation at Rome, xVI. Cataline was endeavouring to augment his force
in the field. He found about two thousand men under Mallius. These he formed into two legions, and as his party increased he completed their num- bers. He refuted for tome time to enrol the fu- gitive slaves, of whom many took refuge in his camp; thinking it would discredit and weaken his cause to reft any part of it on this support. But the freemen that joined him being ill armed, he was obliged to keep in the neighbourhood of the mountains, and frequently to change his ground, to avoid an engagement with the Consul; and he endeavoured to gain time, in hopes that, the in- tended blow being struck at Rome, a general de- section of the opposite party would ensue. But when accounts came that his design had failed in the city, and that his principal aflbciates were no more, those who were inclined to his cause were discouraged, and numbers who had already joined him began to fall off, he determined to remove to a distance from his enemies; and for this purpose directed his march to a pass in the Apennines, by which he might escape into Gaul. This design the Praetor Metellus had foreseen, made a forced march to prevent the effet of it, and Cataline at last, finding himself beset on every quarter, deter- mined to hazard a battle. Of the armies that were in the field againit him, he chore to face that of Antonius; either because it lay on his route to Rome, and, if defeated or removed, might
open
open his way to the city, or because he hoped to c H A P. meet in the commander of it some remains of in- xv--. clination in his favour. In whatever degree these hopes were at first reasonably conceived, they ceased to have any foundation; as Antonius, be- ing taken ill, had left the army under the com- mand of Petreius. With this commander Cata- line engaged in battle, and, after many efforts of valour and of conduc, fell, with the greater part of his followers, and thus delivered the State from a desperate enemy, whose power was happily not equal to his designs, and who has owed much of his celebrity to the orator and the hiltorian, who have made him the subject of their eloquent com- position'. Sallust appears to have been so intent on raising and finishing particular parts of his work, that he negle&ed the general order of his narrative. I have, therefore, in most parts of the relation, preferred the authority of Cicero to his. This great man was undoubtedly best informed, and he refted so much of his reputation on this tranfaaion, that he loses no opportunity of return- ing to it, and in different parts of his writings, when collected, has furnished a pretty full narra- tion of circumfiances refpeding the origin and termination of this wild and profligate attempt to subvert the government of the republic.

conceived in so much guilt, or of characters so atro- cious as those under which the accomplices of Ca- taline are described by the eloquent orator and his- torian ', from whose writings the circumflances of the late conspiracy are collected. The scene, how- ever, in this republic was such as to have no pa. rallel, either in the pass or in' the subsequent his- tory of mankind. There was less government, and more to be governed, than has been exhibited in any other instance. The inhabitants of Italy, as citizens of Rome, were become mailers of the known world. They pretended to govern in a body, but it was impossible they ever could meet in a fair and adequate convention. They were re- presented, therefore, by partial meetings or occa- iional tumults in the capital and to take the sense of the People on many a subjed, was little better than to occaficn a riot. Individuals were veiled with powers ailioft discretionary in the pro-
vinces, . Cicero in Sa;!uR.
vinces, or continually aspired to such situations. c H A '. At home they were impatient of government, and .v''. in haste to govern. Ruined in their fortunes by private prodigality, or by the public expence in soliciting honouys; tempted to repair their ruins by opprefion and extortion where they were in- trusted with command, or by desperate attempts against the government of their country, if difap- pointed in their hopes of sharing its profits. Not only were many of the prevailing practices difor- derly, but the law itself was erroneous '; adopt- ed indeed at first by a virtuous people, because it secured the persons and the rights of individuals againit the possibility of injustice, but now anxi- oufly preserved by their posterity, because it. gave a licence to their crimes.
The provinces were to be retained by the forces of Italy; the Italians, them el ves by the ascendant of the capital; and in this capital all was confiu- lion and anarchy, except where the Senate, by its authority and the wildom of its councils, prevail- ed. It was no doubt expedient for the People to reltrain abuses of the ariftocratical power; but when they aifumed the government into their own hands, or when the sovereignty was exercised ini the name of the collective body, Labues were mul-

H A P. tiplied, and the confusion or anarchy which pre- xyv. vailed at Rome spread from one extremity of her
dominion to the ,other. The provinces were op- pressed, not upon a regular plan to aggrandize the State, but at the pleasure of individuals, to enrich a few of the most outrageous and profligate citi- zens. The People, under pretence of exerting their own powers, were perpetually violating the laws which had been made to restrain usurpations; and the public interetls and the order of the State were in perpetual struggle with the pretensions of demagogues, or of single and profligate men. In such a iituation there were many temptations to be wick- ed; and in such a situation likewise, minds that were turned to integrity and honour had a proportion- ate spring and scope to their exertions and pur- suits. The range of the human chara6ter was great and extensive, and men were not likely to trifle within narrow bounds; they were defined to be good or to be wicked in the highest mea- sure, and, by their struggles, to exhibit a scene in- teresting and inftrutive beyond any other in the history of mankind.
Among the causes that helped to carry the cha- raders of men in this age to such distant extremes, may be reckoned the philosophy of the Greeks, which was lately come into fashion, and which was much affected by the higher ranks of men in the State '. Literature, by the difficulty and ex-

XVIII. fined to persons having wealth and power, it was confidered as a diftindion of rank, and had its vogue not only as an useful, but as a fashionable accomplishment '. The lessons of the school were admitted as the elements of every liberal and at- ive profession, and they were quoted at the bar, in the field, in the Senate, and every where in the conduct of real affairs. Philosophy was confider- ed as: an ornament, as well as a real foundation of strength, ability and wisdom, in the practice of life. Men of the world, instead of being ashamed of their fedt, affeced to employ its language on every important occasion, and to be governed by its rules so much as to assume, in compliance with particular systems, diflindions of manners, and even of dress. They embraced their forms in philofo- phy, as the fedaries in modern times have embra- ced theirs in religion; and probably in the one cafe honoured their choice by the sincerity of their faith and the regularity of their pracice, much in the fame degree as they have done in the other.
In these latter times of the Roman republic the fed of Epicurus appears to have prevailed; and what. Fabricius, on hearing rehearsed the tenets of this philosophy, wished for the enemies of Rome, had now befallen her citizens . Men were
glutted i The grandees had their saves sometimes educated to serve as secretaries to themselves, or as preceptors to their children.
2 See Plutarch. in Pyrr. The philosopher Cyneas, in the hearing of Fa- bricius, entertained his prince with an argument, to prove that pleasure was the chief good. Fabricius wilhed that the enemies of Rome might long en- tertain such tenets.
CHAP. glutted with national prosperity; they thought , XVi'that they were born to enjoy what their fathers
had won, and saw not the use. of those austere and arduous virtues by which the State had increased to its present greatness. The votaries of this feE ascribed the formation of the world to chance, and denied the existence of Providence. They re- solved the diftindions of right and wrong, of ho- nour and dishonour, into mere appellations of plea- sure and pain. Every man'spleafure was to him- self the supreme rule of estimation and of action. All good was private. The public was a mere imposture, that might be successfully employed, perhaps to defraud the ignorant of their private enjoyments, while it furnimied the conveniences of the wife . By persons so instructed, the care of families and of states, with whatever else broke in upon the enjoyments of pleasure and ease, were claifed among the follies of human life. And a led under these imputations might be confidered as patrons of licentiousness, both in morality and religion, and declared enemies to mankind. Yet the Epicureans, when urged in argument by their opponents, made some concessions in religion, and many more in morality. They admitted the ex- iftence of gods, but fiuppofed those beings of too. exalted a nature to have any concern in the affairs of men.. They owned that, although good and pleasure were synonymous terms, yet, among the varieties of pleasure, those of virtue were the
chief. i Cicero in Filbnem.
chief. A concession after which they ought to have c H A P. said that virtue or the chief pleasure was also the xv'_ . chief good, yet they frill returned to the general ap- pellation of pleasure, at the hazard of misleading the vulgar and even themselves in their choice '; and while they contended that their difference with o- ther fedts consisted in a mere dispute about words, those they were pleased to employ, served to sup- press the specific sentiments of conscience and ele- vatoin of mind, and to change the reproaches of criminality, profligacy, or vileness, by which even bad men are restrained from iniquity, into mere imputations of mistake, or variations of taste.
Other seaes, particularly that of the Stoicks, maintained, almost in every particular, the re- verse of these tenets. lThey maintained the rea- lity of Providence, and of a common interest of goodness and of justice, for which Providence was exerted, and in which all rational creatures were deeply concerned. They maintained, that although it be evident that happiness or the chief good is pleasant; yet it were albfil-r conversely to fay, that every pleaiure is happincts or the chief good. In
the I SEven the leader of this sect hinimflc, Ilhonigh more pFre in the choice of his pleafiure than many of his followtrs, yet vwas ifr stion being regulated in the choice he made by the more important occalions of lhunan life. To him tile rearing of a family, without which the human race mlmn speedily pc- rilh; the offices of State, without which society cannot cxilt; were not only !i.peifluons, but expressly precluded from the choice of a wife nan. His vrxrne was to be found in the peaceful retirement of a garden, in exemption ;'-.v"' ai or trOf -lc, in contemplation e.nd serenity of mind, in the society ' a ;-v* fIcledl ii icrcs, with sobriety and rnoderation of diet, and other fen- d.;.-i:tv.,*
c H A P. the application of there terms we must attend to ,_-^ the exemption from suffering, as well as the mea-
sure of enjoyment; and as our understanding can- not reach every possible effect upon which to efti- mate the least measure of pain, and the greatest of pleasure, Providence has not left us to the effect of such a discussion: we are taught to choose, on the first infpetion of things, the part of the in- nocent, of the praise-worthy and just: Of this choice the pleasure is most delightful, and the sense of having failed in it, the most grievous pain; in so much, that although in the nature of things there are many grounds upon which we prefer or reject the objects that present themselves to us, yet the choice which we make, and our own ations, not the event of our efforts, decides our happi- ness or our misery; that right and wrong are the most important and the only grounds upon which we can at all times safely proceed in our choice, and that, in comparison to this difference, every thing else is of no account; that a just man will ever ad as if there was nothing good but what is right, and nothing evil but what is wrong; that the Epicureans mistook human nature when they supposed all its principles resolvable into appetites for pl.afure, or aversions to pain; that honour and diihonour, excellence and defec, were confidera- tions which not only led to much nobler ends, but which were of much greater power in command- ing the human will; the love of pleasure was gro- veling and vile, was the source of dissipation and
of
of sloth; tlhe love of excellence and honour was C HA P. aspiring and noble, and led to the greatest exer- .VIL tions and the highest attainments of our nature. They maintained that there is no private good separate from the public; that the fame quali- ties of the understanding and the heart, wisdom, benevolence, and courage, which are good for the individual, are so likewise for the public; that these blessings every man may poflefs, indepen- dent of fortune or the will of other men; and that whoever does possess them has nothing to hope, and nothing to fear, and can have but one fort of emotion, that of fatisfation and joy; that his as- fedtions, and the maxims of his ifation, as a crea- ture of God, and as a member of society, lead him to ad for the good of mankind; and that for himself he has nothing more to desire, than the happiness of ating this part. These, they said, were the tenets of reason leading to a perfection, which ought to be the aim of every person who means to preserve his integrity, or to consult his happiness, and towards which every one may ad- vance, although no one has atually reached it.
In these disputes the celebrated fable of Pro- dicus seemed to be realized; and as virtue and pleasure there contended for the ear of youth, in- tegrity and corruption now strove for acceptance with a pampered and restless people.
Among those on whom the public fortune fee-c; ed to depend, Cefar is said to have embraced the doctrines of Epicurus; Cato those of 7,cno. The

CHAP. firfi, from indifference to moral diftindtions, in ,xvn. compliance with fashion, or from the bias of an
original temper. The other, from the force of conviction, as wvell as from the predilection of a warm and ingenuous mind. When such charac- ters occur together, it is impofIible not to fee them in contrait. And Sallust in relating what pafied in the Senate, on the iubjed of the Cataline confpi- racy, seens to overlook every other characder, to dwell upon these alone. Cxfar, at the time when this historian flourished, had many claims to his notice ; but Cato could owe it to nothing but the force of truth. He was distinguished from his infancy by an ardent and afectionate disposition. This part of his chara.cer is mentioned on occaiion of his attachment to his brother Capio, and the vehement Iorrow wit'h which he was seized at his death. It is mentioned, on occasion of his visit to the Dictator Sylla, when he was with d ifficulty re- firained, by the discretion of his tutor, from some ac or expreflion of indignation against this real or apparent violator of public justice. He had from his infancy, according to Plutarch, a resolution, a A:eadincfs, and a composure of mind, not to be mo- -ed by fl ttryv, nor to be ihaken by threats. 'Without ftwninig or insinuation, lie was the ta- olri te, o'f lis companions, and had, by his una'- !:ced generosity and courage, the principal place hii their confidence. Though in appearance stern
and S2., ;::; -c.:<.L hinci!f to Cxa:ar, and wsas emlpk'yced b ;i iii i i tie civil
and inflexible, he was warm in his affections, and c Is A '. zealous in the cause of innocence and justice. x vL Such are the marks of an original temper, affixed by historians as the characers of his infancy and early youth. So fitted by nature, he imbibed with ease an opinion, that profligacy, cowardice, and malice, were the only evils to be feared; courage, integrity, and benevolence, the only good to be coveted; and that the proper care of a man on every occasion is, not what is to happen to him, but what he himself is to do. With this profef- sion he became a striking contrast to many of his contemporaries; and to Cwefar in particular, not only a contrast, but a resolute opponent; and al- though in these times he could not furnith a sus- ficient counterpoise, yet he afforded always much weight to be thrown into the opposite scale. They v'cre both of undaunted courage, and -of great pe- netration; the one to diftinguiifl what was bet ; the other to avail himself of the most effeq&ual means for the attainment of any end on which he was bent. It were to mistake entirely the scene in which they were engaged, to judge of their abili- ties from the event of their different pursuits. Those of Cato were by their nature in direct op- polition to the current of manners, and they were a series of struggles with almofi insurmountable difficulties: those of Caxfar went with the tre.am, and except when he was jostled in the competition with others who ran the fame co.urle with himself, he had only to ftize the advmataecs cf which the
~s XC~vices
c HA r. vices and weaknesses of the times gave him an easy xvIII. L.Lr poiffefion. Cato endeavoured to preserve the order
of civil government, howev or desperate, because this was the part it became him to ad, and in which he chose to live and to die. Cefar hastened its ruin ; because he was eager for power, and wiihed to dif- pose of all the wealth and honours of the State at his own discretion.
Caesar, as versatile in his genius, as Cato was steady and inflexible, could personate any charac- ter, and support any cause; in debate he could derive his arguments from any topic; from topics of pity, of which he was insensible; from topics ofjuftice and public good, for which he had no regard. His vigour in refilting personal insults or attacks appeared in his early youth, when he with- stood the imperious commands of Sylla to part with his wife, the daughter of Cinna, and when he revenged the violence done by the pirates to himself; but while his temper might be supposed the most animated and warm, he was not involved .in business by a predilection for any of the inte- refts on which the People was divided. So long as the appetites of youth were sufficient to occupy him, he saw every obje&c of State, or of faction, with indifference, and took no part in public as- fairs. But even irn this period, by his application and genius, in both of which he was eminent, he made a distinguished progress in letters and elo- quence. When he turned his mind to objets of ambition, the fame personal vigour which appear- ed in his youth, became still more conspicuous;
but,
but, unfortunately, this pafflon, the most energe- c HA P tic and powerful in the human mind, instead of Xv.'- urging to genuine greatness, and elevation of na- ture, was in him a mere principle of competition among the leaders of faction at Rome. He had attained to feven-and-thirty years of age before he took any considerable part as a member of the com- monwealth. He then courted the populace in pre- ference to the Senate or better fort of the Peo- ple, and made his first appearance in support of the profligate, against the forms and authority of government. With persons of desperate fortune and abandoned manners, he early bore the cha- racers of liberality and friendship , was received among them as a generous spirit, come to explode the morose severity of those who would reltrain the freedom of youth within the limits of fobrie- ty and public order. Though himself a person of the greatest abilities, and the most accomplish- ed talents, having an opportunity to live on terms of equality with the greatest men that have yet appeared in the world, he chore to Ilart up as the chief among those who, being abandoned to every vice, saw the remains of virtue in their country with distaste and aversion. In proportion as he emerged from the avocations of pleasure, or from the sloth which accompanies the languor of diffi- pation, his desire to counteraCt the eflablifhed go- vernment of his country, and to make himself maf- ter of the commonwealth, became more and more evident. To this paflion he sacrificed every fen-
VOL. II A a timent
H A P. timent of friendflip or animosity, of honour, inte- ,Vl- reft, resentment, or hatred. The philosophy which
taught men to look for enjoyment indiscriminately wherever it pleased them most, found a ready ac- ceptance in such a disposition. But while he pof- sibly availed himself of the speculations of Epicu- rus to justify his choice of an object, he was not inferior to the followers of Zeno, in vigorous es- forts and active exertions for the attainment of his ends. Being about seven years younger than Pom- pey, and three years older than Cato; the first he oc- cafionally employed as a prop to his own ambition, or at Icaft, in the early part of his career, did not teem to perceive him as a rival; the other, from a fixed animosity of opposite natures, and from hav- ing felt him as a continual opponent in all his de- signs, he sincerely hated.
Cato began his military service in the army which was employed against the gladiators, and concluded it as a legionary Tribune, under the Pretor Rubrius, in Macedonia, while Pompey re- mained in Syria. He was about three-and-thirty years of age when he made his speech in the Se- nate, relating to the accomplices of Cataline; and by the decilive and resolute spirit he had shown on this occasion, came to be confidered as a principal support of the government and authority of the Senate I. To this body, as usual, every flagrant dif- order repreiled, brought an accession of power; and the discovery of a design, so odious as that of Ca-
taline, { r~~:t~iii'.ar h. h.Ct'n. Cd:- Lenr.l;;. p. 238,
taline, covered under popular pretences, greatly c H A P. served to discredit the supposed popular cause. X_ One of the first uses the Senate proposed to make of their advantage, was to have Cato elected among the Tribunes of the subsequent year. His fervi- ces were likely to be wanted in opposition to the schemes of Metellus Nepos, who was then arrived from the army in Syria, with recommendations to public favour as a candidate for the office of Tri- bune ; and if he ihould prevail in the.election 'hy the influence of Pompey, it was not doubted, he came charged with some measure to gratify the ambition or vanity of this insatiable suitor for per- fonal consideration and honour. It had not yet ap- peared what part he was to take in the disputes which were likely to arise on the legality or ex- pedience of the late summary executions; but it is not to be doubted, that he wished to hold the balance of parties, and that he would come prepared for the part that was most likely to pro- mote his own importance. Metellus was sent on before him to be supported by his friends in the competition which was expedced, and with his inftrudions to take such measures as were likely to favour his prctenfions.
The leading men of the Senate were now, for some time, aware of the intrigues of Pompey, and bore, with impatience, the personal superiority which he affected even to the firfi and most re- ipecded men of their order. They took occasion, in the present crisis, to mortify him, by admitting
A a . T2 lclln,
C H A P Lucullus and Metellus Creticus to the triumphs to .XVu1. which, by their refpedive victories in Pontus and
in Crete, they were long entitled. Hitherto the claims of these officers had been over-ruled by the popular faction, either to annoy the Senatorian party, to which they were attached, or to flatter Pompey, who was supposed to be equally averse to the honours of both. They had waited in Italy about three years, and, in the manner of those who sue for a triumph, still retaining the farces or ensigns of their late command 1, had refrained from entering the city.
Lucullus, having obtained the honour that was due to him, seemed to be satisfied with the ac- knowledgment of his right; and, as if merely to show with what fort of enemy he had fought, he entered the city with a few of the Armenian horsemen cared in armour, a few of the armed chariots winged with scythes, and about sixty of the officers and courtiers of Mithridates, who were his captives. He ordered the spoils he had gain- ed, the arms and ensigns of war, the prows of the gallies he had taken, to be displayed in the great circus, and concluded the solemnity with giving a feast to the People. The Senate hoped for his iupport againit the ambition of Pompey, and the factious designs of the popular leaders; but he was disgusted, and from thence forward scarcely ever took a part in the affairs of State.
The triumph of Metellus Creticus did not take place till after the acceflion of P. Junius Silanus
and r Cicero in Lucullo.
and Lucius Murana, Consuls of the following year, c H A P. after whose election, Cicero, before he had vacated xvtL. the office, or laid down the fasces, had occasion to de- fend his intended successor Murmna, against a charge of corruption brought upon the statute of Calpurni- us, by Servius Sulpicius, one of his late competitors, supported by Cato and others. The oration of Cicero on this occasion is still extant, and is a cu- rious example of the topics which, under popular governments, are recurred to even in judicial plead- ings. Great part of it consists in a ridicule of law terms; because Sulpicius, one of the prosecutors, used to give counsel to his friends who consulted him in matters of law; and in a ridicule of the Stoic philosophy, because Cato, another prose- cutor, was supposed to have embraced the doc- trines of that fee. Cato made no other remark on this pleading, but that the republic was pro- vided with a merry Coniul. The argument how- ever appeared sufficiently strong on the fide of Mu- rena, and he was acquitted.
At the close of this trial, Cicero, about to abdigate his power, and being to make the usual affevera- tion, upon oath, That he had faithfully, and to the best of his abilities, dischargcd his trust; pro- posed to introduce this solemnity with a speech to the People, but was ordered by Metellus, already elected, and acting in the capacity of Tribune, to confine himself to the simple terms of his oath. He accordingly refrained from speaking; but in- stead of fwcaring limply, That he had been faith-
A a3 ful
c H A P. fill to his trust, he took an oath, That he had pre- XVIII.
,. served the republic'. It was on this occasion,
probably, that Cato, now another of the Tribunes, addressing himself to the People, and alluding to the suppression of the late conspiracy, called Ci- cero the father of his Country2; and from this time entered upon an opposition to his colleague Metellus, which was not likely to drop while they continued in office. u. c.: eg. Soon after the accession of the new magistrates, D. Juniui silanus, L. a storm began to gather, which, though still aimed
at the party of the Senate, burit at last in a per- fonal attack upon the late Consul, who had been the prompter or instrument of the Senate in the late summary proceedings against the accomplices of Cataline. Metellus Nepos seems to have come from kfia, and to have entered on the office of Tribune, with a particular design to bring about the recep- tion of Pompey with his army into Rome; and in this project he was joined by Caius Cxefar 3, now in the office of Prxtor, who chose to support the Tribune in this measure, as an ad of hostility to the Senate, if not as the means of obtaining a pre- cedent of which he might in his turn avail him- self.
In consequence of a plan concerted with C-efar, the Tribune Metellus moved in the Senate, as had .been usual in the times of its highest authority, for leave to propofc a decree in the assembly of the

People recalling Pompey from Asia at the head of c H A p. his forces, in order to restore the constitution of x.1. the commonwealth, which, in the terms he after- wards employed to the People, had been violated by the arbitrary administration of Cicero. This was the firit attempt of the party to inflame the minds of the People on the subject of the late exe- cutions; and Pompey was, in this manner, offered to the popular party as their leader to avenge the supposed wrongs they had received. Cato, when the matter was proposed in the Senate, endeavour- ed to persuade Metellus to withdraw his motion, reminding him of the dignity of his family, which had been always a principal ornament and support of the State. This treatment served only to raise the presumption of Metellus, and brought on a vio- lent altercation between the Tribunes. The Se- nate applauded Cato, but had not authority enough to prevent the motion which was proposed fromz being made to the People.
Metellus, apprehending an obstinate refirfance from his colleague, endeavoured to fill the place of assembly with his own partizans; and, on the evening before the meeting, in order to intimidate his opponents, paraded in the streets with a nume- rous attendance of men in arms. The friends and relations of the other Tribunes earnestly beseech- ed them not to expose themselves to the dangers with which they were threatened. But, on the following day, the other party being already as- fembled by Metellus, at the temple of Castor, and
A a 4 the
c H A . the place having been in the night occupied by x H. persons under his direction, armed with clubs,
swords, and other offensive weapons ', Cato went forth attended only by Minucius Thermus, another of the Tribunes, and a few friends. They were joined by numbers in the streets, who could not accompany them to their place, being prevented by the multitude of armed men who already crowd- ed the avenues and the steps of the temple. But they themselves, from respect to their office, being suffered to pass, dragged along with them through the crowd, as an aid, in cafe any violence were of- sered, Munatius, a citizen much attached to Cato. When they came to the bench of Tribunes, they found that Metellus, with the Practor Julius Cxe- far, had taken their places there; and that, in or- der to concert their operations in the conduct of this affair, they were closely feated together. Ca- to, to disappoint this intention, forced himself in betwixt them, and, when the ordinary officer be- gan to read the intended decree, interposed his negative, or forbade him to proceed. Metellus himself seized the writing, and began to read; but Cato snatched it out of his hands. Metellus en- deavoured to repeat the substance of it from his memory. Thermus clapt a hand to his mouth. A general silence remained in the assembly, till Me- tellus, having made a signal concerted with his party to clear the comitium of their enemies, a great tu. mult and confusion arose ; and the Tribunes who
opposed X Plutarch in Catone, edit. Londin. . 241, 8&c.
opposed Metellus were in imminent danger. The CH A P. Senators had met in mourning, to mark their sense . XVIII. of the evils which threatened the commonwealth; and now, under the apprehension of some signal calamity, gave a charge to the Consuls to watch over the safety of the State, and empowered them to take such measures as might be necessary to pre, serve or to restore the peace '.
In consequence of this charge, the Consul Mu- rana appeared with a body of men in arms, had the good fortune to rescue Cato and Minucius Thermus; and probably by this seasonable inter- position effaced any remains of misunderstanding which might have subsisted between Cato and himself, on account of the prosecution for bribery which followed the late elections '.
Metellus, after the tumult was composed, hav- ing again obtained silence, began to read the pro- posed decree; but the Senatorian party, headed by the Consuls, being then in the comitium, he found it impossible to proceed; and, together with the Praetor Caius Caesar, retired from the assembly. From this time, these officers made no attempt to resume their motion, but complain- ed that the government was usurped by a violent faction, under whom even the persons of the Tri- bunes were unsafe ; and Metellus, as if forced to break through the rules which obliged the Tri- bunes to conitant residence at Rome, abandoned

C H A P. the city, even left Italy, and fled to the camp of --_I, Pompey in Asia, from which he had but lately set
out on his journey to Rome '. He had already threatened his opponents in the city with the re- fentment and military power of his general, and now endeavoured to excite the army and their com- mander to follow the example which had been set to them by Sylla and his legions, when oppressed citizens, a description which he now assumed to himself, fled to them for protecion and revenge.
It may well be supposed, that Caesar, remember- ing his own escape from the ruin of the Marian faction, and confidering Pompey as the head of an opposite interest, and a principal obstacle to his own ambition, muff look upon him with some de- gree of personal dislike and animosity; but his con- dud on this occasion sufficiently showed how little he was the dupe of any passion or sentiment which had a tendency to check his pursuits. Meaning for the present only to weaken the Senate, and to partake in the favour which Pompey enjoyed with the People; he undertook the cause even of a ri- val, and would have joined the populace, in deli- vering the commonwealth into his hands, rather than remain under a government which he confi- dered as the principal bar to his own elevation. But if he really meant to overthrow the Senate by force, he mistook his instrument. Pompey, no doubt, aspired to be the first among citizens, and wished for the ostentation of military power at
Rome; z Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvii. c. 43.
Rome; but even this he desired to receive as the c H AP. fruit of consideration and personal refped; and he xv . ever hoped to make the People bestow it, and even force him to accept of it as their gift. For this purpose he encouraged so many agents and re- tainers to found.his own praise; and for this pur- pose he had recently sent Metellus Nepos from his camp in Asia to take upon him the functions of a popular Tribune at Rome; but having failed in the project of vanity, his mind mifgave him in the project of force. No one ever courted diftinaion with a more incessant emulation to his rivals; but he was entirely dependent on the public opinion for any fatisfaftion he enjoyed in the possession of power. Trusting perhaps to this part of his charac- ter, Caesar, though no way remiss as a rival, was not yet alarmed at the elevation of Pompey, and thought that he was safe in admitting him to govern with the sword at Rome. Pompey was, at this con- .uncture, with his army moving. towards Italy, and his approach was matter of great apprehension to the friends of the commonwealth, who feared that, in return to the affront of his not being invited, upon the motion of Metellus, to come with his army, he would employ it in person to enforce his commands. Upon his arrival at Brundisium, how- ever, as formerly upon his return from Africa, he dispelled those fears by an immediate dismission of the troops, with infirutions, merely that they should attend at his triumph. He himself came forward to Romc w.ith !1he single equipage of his Procon-
fular
c H A P. fular rank. Multitudes of every condition went .XVIL forth to receive him, and with shouts and accla-
mations recompenfed the moderation with which he acquiesced in the condition of a citizen.
Cafar, from whatever motive he acted in regard to Pompey, gave every other sign of difaffedion to the Senate, and employed the name of this ri- ling favourite of the People, to mortify such of the members in particular as were objects of personal animosity to himself. The repairs or rebuilding of the Capitol being finished about this time, the honour of dedicating the edifice, and of being named in the inscription it was to bear, was, by a resolution of the Senate, conferred on Catulus, under whose infpedion the work had been execu- ted. But Cxfar, affecting to obtain this honour for Pompey, alleged that Catulus had embezzled the money allotted for the service.; that much yet remained to be done; and moved, that the inscription of Catulus should be erased; that the completion of the work being left to Pompey, ihould carry an inscription with his name 1. Here he probably aced as much from antipathy to one, as from an intention to flatter the other. But the design being extremely odious to the whole body of the Nobles, who saw, with indignation, in that proposal, an attempt to affront a most refpedable citizen, in order to flatter the vanity of one per- ion, and to gratify the profligate refcntments of
another; z Sueton. in Jul. Cesare, c. 15.
another; under this aspea of the business, Cxefar c H A P. was obliged to withdraw his motion '.
It was probably during this year in which Ca- far was Proetor, and before the arrival of Pompey from Asia (although historians refer it to an earli- er date), that Cxefar promoted, as has been already mentioned, prosecutions upon a charge of affaffina- tion against some of the persons concerned in the execution of Sylla's proscriptions. The Praetors had in charge by lot to superintend the application of particular laws. The law respecting assassination appears to have been the lot of Caesar; and he was entitled, in virtue of his office, the jurifdicion of which was still very arbitrary, to extend, by his ediCt or plan of proceeding for the year, the de- scription of the crime under his cognizance to any special cafe.
While he seemed to have formed so many de- signs against the peace of the commonwealth, and in the capacity of Praetor supported them with the authority of a magistrate, the Senatorian party made a powerful exertion of their influence to have him suspended, and aCtually obtained a de- cree for this purpofc. He affected at firfi to flight their authority; but finding that a power was preparing to enforce it, perhaps at the hazard of his life, he laid aside for some time the robes and badges of magistracy, dismissed his Lidors, and ab- stained from the functions of Prxtor, until, having rejected an offer of the People to restore him by
force, X Din. Ca 1. li. x'vii. c. 44
cHA . force, he was, with proper marks of regard, for ,_-~ lthis inflance of moderation and duty, reinstated by
an aft of the Senate itself'.
The ariftocratical party, meanwhile, to confirm and perpetuate the evidence on which they had proceeded against the accomplices of Cataline, continued their prosecutions on this subjed, and obtained sentence of condemnation, in parti- cular, against a citizen of the name of Vergun- teius, and against Autronius, who, about two years before, having been eleded Consul, was set aside upon a charge of bribery; and who, from the dif- gust which he took to the Senate upon that occa- sion, had conneted himself with the more defpe- rate party. · Publius Sylla, as has been mentioned, was also tried; but upon the pleading and tefti- mony of Cicero, who poffelfed all the information obtained on this subjed, was honourably acquit- ted.
Caesar likewise was accused by Vedius as ac- ceffary to the conspiracy of Cataline; but it is not likely that he was concerned farther than by the general encouragement he gave to every party at variance with the Senate. Opposition to this body was reputed the cause of the People, and was pre- tended by every person who had any passions to gratify by crimes of State, or who wished to weak- en the government, to which they themselves were accountable. Among the supporters of this in- terest, Crassus also was accused, but probably on no better grounds than Cefar.
The T Sueton. in Jul. C;esare, c. z6.
The whole of these proceedings, however, were c H A P. suspended by the approach of Pompey. This xv . leader had now drawn the attention of all men upon himself, was quoted in every harangue as the great support of the empire, and courted by mul- titudes, who, without inquiry, or knowledge of his person affeced to be classed with his admirers and friends. While the contagion spread, like a faflhion, among the People. He himself affeded indiffe- rence to this mighty tide of renown, though not without much dignity and state, which he tem- pered with affability and grace; employing the greatness he possessed to give the more value to his condescensions. His manner, though acceptable to the People and the army he commanded, was disagreeable to the Senate. Having previously sent Pifo, one of his lieutenants, before him to tand for the Consulate, he had the presumption to de- fire that the Senate would defer the elections un- til he himself could be present to canvass for his friend. The Senate, according to Dio, complied with his desire; but, according to Plu/rch, re- jeded the proposal with disdain. This author im- putes the resolution, which they took upon this occasion, to Cato, and subjoins, that Pompey as- terwards endeavoured to gain this opponent by a proposed marriage with one of his near relations; and that Cato declined the connection, faying, That he flould not be caught in a female Inare. Pifo, however, was eleced together with Valerius Meffala, and entered on his office before the folem- nity of Pompey's triumph.

rii, and the Commageni, together with trophies for c H, P. every battle he had fought, making in all a more xv-t. splendid exhibition than any that was to be found on the records of the State.
The triumphal processions of Pompey merit more attention than those of any other person, be- cause they exhibit his character as well as military success. Others took the benefit of an eftablifled practice to publish and to ratify the honours they had acquired; but Pompey, it is likely, would have invented the triumph, even if it had not been formerly thought of; and it is not to be doubted, that he over-ran some provinces in which the ene- my were subdued, or in which they were so weak, as not to be able to make any refiiance, merely to place them in the lift of his conqueits; and that he made some part of his progress in Asia merely to accumulate trophies and ornaments for this pompous scene.
The triumph, in its ordinary form, confited only of such exhibitions as had a reference to the service in which it was obtained; the captives and spoils of the enemy, with effigies or representations of the first, where the originals, by any accident, could not be displayed. But in the folemnities intlitu- ted for the honour of Pompey, were admitted what- ever could distinguish or signalize the occasion. Among there, according to the record transcribed by Pliny', there were many coitly ornaments of gold and of precious flones, not takexn from the

made of one entire. crystal; a model of the moon in gold, weighing thirty pondo; tables, utensils, ffatues, crowns adorned with precious stones, the representation also of an entire mountain in gold, with its herds of deer, and other animals, haunted with lions: and what serves as an evidence that these exhibitions were not limited to the spoils actually taken in war, there is mentioned an effigy of Pompey himself incruited with pearls. The whole conduEted with more arrangement and or- der, than were necfefary, perhaps, in the difpofi- tion made for any of the battles which the triumph was intended to celebrate.
Among the images, representations, and memo- riais which were carried before the victor on this occasion, there was held up to view a slate of the public finance, from which it appeared, that be- fore Pompey's time the revenue amounted to no more than fifty millions ; and that the addition which he alone brought to it amounted to eighty- five millions 2.
Soon after this pomp was over, an aflembly of the People was called in the Circus Flaminius, to re- ceive an address from the victorious commander: but, from an extreme caution not to offend any par- ty, the speech which he made, upon this occalion, was acceptable to none.

Pompey was suffered to pof-. fess the highest place in the conlideration of the public, merely because he assumed it; and he pre- ferved'his dignity, by never committing his repu- tation without being prepared, or without having concerted a variety of arts by which it might be supported 2.
Bb 2 CHAP. i Cicer. ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. 14. 2 Sallust in Catalin. c. 54. in contrasting the characers of Cefar and Cd. to, does not propose to decide on the comparativ- merit of their objects: for this he aflumes to have been consideration or glory, and the fame in both; but in reality he seems to have mistaken the object of either. That of Ce- far was not consideration: for although he courted the public opinion, when subservient to his power; yet he flighted it also, when it tsood in his way to dominion. In the objet of Cato, consideration had no fliare. His life was distinguished by the general tenor of reason, integrity, humanity and justice, in the public cause, whatever the world might think of his condut. And his resolution often led him into measures, iunfccefsful from the want of co- operation in a corrupt or misguided age. The great diltinction of Pompey, if we insert his character into this comparison, was the prevailing attention to consideration or. glory, in preference to either virtue or power.

Caius Antonius, the late colleague of Cicero in the Consulate, soon after the defeat of Cataline, proceeded to the province of Macedonia, of which, by the arrangements of the year, he had been ap- pointed the governor. He entered his province with the ensigns of vicory, which had been ob- tained by the defeat of Cataline; but these he soon forfeited by his mifcondut in a war againfl
the
the Thracians, and by the disgrace which he other- c H A P, wife incurred in the mal-administration of his _ . province. Complaints were exhibited against him for extortion. On this occasion, it had been re- ported by himself, or by some of his family, that, having agreed to divide the profits of his govern- ment with Cicero, part only of his exacions was made on his own account. This allegation, Cice- ro, in a letter to Atticus, mentions with scorn ; and, being asked to undertake the defence of An- - tonius, questions whether he can decently do so under this imputation'. But as he soon after- wards'undertook the cause, and employed his inte- reft to have the Proconsul continued in his pro- vince, it is probable that this imputation either gained no credit, or was entirely removed .
The Allobroges, though deprived of the sup- port they were made to expect from the party of Cataline, nevertheless took arms, and invaded the Roman province of Gaul. After a variety of events, they were repulsed by Pontinius, who then commanded the legions in that quarter, and forced to retire into their own country 3.
About the fame time, ICaius Julius Cwfar, upon the expiration of his term in the office of Prator, obtained his firIt military command, being ap- pointed by lot to the government of Lusitania where, under different pretences, he found an op-

C H A P. portunity to quarrel with the natives, to fliew his
own capacity for war, and to lay some ground for his claim to a triumph 1. In pufling his way to the preferments which he now held in the State, hc had ruined his fortune by largesses, public ihews, and entertainments to the People, by his lavifil bounty in private to needy and profligate citizens, and in. supporting every desperate cause against the Senate and the government; and is reported to have said of himself, when he set out for his province, that he needed one hundred and fifty millions Roman money, or one million two hun- dred thousand pounds sterling, to be worth no- thing 2. When about to depart from the city, he was pressed by his creditors, and had recourse to Crassus, who became his surety for great films 3.
A person who, in any other state than that of Rome, could fippofe such a fortune reparable, must have thought of means alarming to the State itself; but Caesar had now quitted the paths of pleasure for those of ambition; and, in an empire which extended over lo many opulent provinces, needed only to have power, in order to become rich. Although the province which now fell to his lot was not the most wealthy, or was only a ftep to somewhat farther, more considerable, and more likely to supply him with the means of pur- suing his objects, he was nevertheless reported,

even there, to have supplied his own wants, and to c II P. have enriched his army'.
In palling the Alps, on his way into Spain, at a village on the way, one of his company having ob- served, that " Here too there might be parties and " contejs for power." " Aly," said Cafar, with a charaderiflical confellion, " and 1 would rather "be tbefirlf man in this place, than the Jfcond at " Rome 2" Upon his arrival in Lusitania, he made the necefiary augmentation of the army, and soon over-ran all the diftrids that were dif- posed to resist his authority. With the fame ability with which he conducted his military ope- rations, he supported the dignity of a Roman governor, no less in the civil than in the de- partment of war. Historians, upon 1a idea which occurred to them, that the disorder in his own as: f:irs might have rendered him partial to insolvent debtors, and being at pains to acquit him of any such charge, observe. that he gave proofs of the contrary, among which they specify a rule which he followed, in ordering two thirds of the debtor's eflects to be sequestered for the use of his credi- tors 3.
While these things passed in the provinces, the People being indulged in their favourite gratifica- tions, suffered an increase of the political diftem- pers with which the public had been for some time insetcd. The expence and dissipation at- tending the public shews, in particular, were aug_ mented to a great degree. Lucius Domitius Ahe-

In there circumstances, during the c HA P. preceding year, it fell to the lot of Pompeia, as XLX. being wife to one of the Prators in office, to cele- brate, at her house, the festival of a certain female deity ' worshipped by the Romans; and at whose rites women alone were admitted. Every male domestic, even the huiband, was obliged to absent himself from home while the rites were admi- niftered. Clodius took this opportunity to carry on his intrigue; put himself in a female dress, and, being young and of an effeminate asped, ex- pe6ted to pass for a woman 3. Pompeia was sup- posed to be apprised of the design, and to have flationed a female slave to receive and conduct her paramour through the apartments. But being met by another slave who was not in the secret, his voice betrayed him. A cry of amazement and horror was immediately communicated through all the apartments, and the occasion of it discovered to the matrons, who were met to celebrate the rites. Clodius escaped, but not without being known. The college of Pontiffs made a report, that the sacred rites had been profaned. The Se- nate resolved, that inquiry should be made into the grounds of the scandal; and that the People ihould be moved to authorise the Pretor in of- fice to felet, without drawing lots, proper judges for the trial of the accused.
Clodius, x Plutarch. in Cesare, edit. Lond. p. og9. a Called the Bona & Dea. 3 Cicero ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. rs, x3.
C HA P. Clodius, by the suspicion of an incestuous com-
merce with his own fiter, the wife of Lucullus; by his perfidy in reducing the troops of that ge- neral to mutiny, and by his profligacy on every occasion, had incurred a general detestation; and many of the Senators, as the likeliest way of re- moving him from the commonwealth, combined in urging the present prosecution against him.
He himself, foreseeing the itorm, had taken re- fuge in the popular party, and endeavoured to silence the voice of infamy, by professing extraordi- nary zeal for the People, and vehement opposition to the Senate. These parties accordingly became interested in the issue of his cause. The popular leaders endeavoured to preserve him as an useful instrument, and the Senate to remove him, as a vile and dangerous tool, from the hands of their enemies. Even Cafar, though personally insulted, and so far moved by the scandal which had been given in his own house as to part with his wife, fill affected to confider as groundless the charge which was laid against Clodius; and being asked, why he had parted with a woman who, upon this supposition, mufl appear to be innocent, said, that his wife mutl not only be innocent, but above imputation. Pompey, to avoid giving offence, declined to favour either party; but being called upon in the assembly of the People to declare his opinion, whether this trial should proceed according to the decree of the Senate; made a long speech, full of refped to the Nobles, and of
submission
submission to the Senate, whose authority, in all c H A P. questions of this fort, he said, flhould ever with x--- him have the greatest weight. He afterwards, in the Senate itself, being called upon by Meflala the Consul, delivered himself to the fame purpose; and when he had done, whispered Cicero, who fat by him, that he thought he had now sufficiently ex- plained himself; intimating probably, that he meant to comprehend, in this declaration, also his judg- ment with refped to all the ads of the Senate which had pafled relating to the accomplices of Cataline '.
The Consul Pifo was inftruded to carry to the People, for their assent, an ad for the better con- dut of the trial of Clodius, dispensing with the usual mode of draughting the judges by lot, and authorising the Prator to feled them, that he might name the more refpetable persons. On the day on which this motion was to be made, a nu- merous party of young Nobility appeared for the defendant. His hirelings and retainers crowded the Comitium. Even Pifo, who moved the que- stion, difluaded the People from passing the law, and allowed the friends of Clodius to put a ridi- culous trick on the assembly, by distributing to the People, as they came forward to vote, two ballots, which, instead of being, as usual, one negative and the other affirmative, were both negative. This trick being observed, Cato, with the authority of Tribune, suspended the ballot, and firongly re- monftrated agai.ft the proceeding of the Consul 2.
In i Cicero ad Atticum, lib. i. epift. 13, 14. i6. X Ibid.
CH A P. In this he was supported by Hortenfius and Favo- ' X. nius. The assembly broke up, and the affair again
returned to the Senate. The members were im- portuned by Clodius, who cast himself at their feet as they entered; they, nevertheless, confirmed their former resolution by a majority of four hun- dred to fifteen '.
Hortenfius, however, having proposed that, in- flead of the motion which the Consuls had been inftruaed to make for the feletion of the judges, the Tribune Fuiius ihould move the People to grant commission for the trial, leaving the judges, as usual, to be drawn by lot; an edid was accor- dingly framed and passed to this effet. Horten- iius, who conducted the trial, was confident that no jury could acquit the accused. And the court, in all their proceedings, seemed at first inclined to severity. They even applied for a guard to pro- tea their persons againit the partizans of the cri- minal; but the majority, nevertheless, it was alle- ged, suffered themselves to be corrupted, or took money in the course of the trial. Of fifty-fix judges that were inclosed, twenty-five gave their voice to condemn, and thirty-one to acquit. Ca- tulus, on this occasion, asked the majority to what purpose they had desired a guard? "Was it," he laid, with a sarcasm, which modern juries could ill endure, " to secure the money you expected to "receive for your votes '?"
Soon after this judgment the Senate resolved that inquiry ihould be made concerning those
judges I Cicer. ad Att. lib. i. cpift. I3, 14, x6. iDio. Call lib. xxxvii. c. 46. Cicero ad Att. lib. i. cp. x6.
judges who had been corrupted in the trial. And c H A P. by this resolution gave a general offence to the XIX. Equestrian order, who confidered it as an imputa- tion on their whole body '.
Pompey, in the course of this tranfadion, had been obliged to declare himself for the Senate; but his objea was to be on good terms with all parties, and to manage his interest, by having some of his creatures always chosen into the highest of- sices of State. He offered, as candidate for the Con- fulate of the following year, Afranius, one of his dependants, who is represented by Cicero as a per- son of mean character, and who, having no per- fonal dignity, nor any credit with the People, was to be supported in his canvass by money alone. Pompey himself, and the Consul Pifo, openly em- ployed bribery in obtaining votes in his favour :.
A variety of resolutions were obtained in the Senate to restrain these practices. Two of them were proposed by Cato and Domitius. The first was levelled against the Consul Pifo himself, and gave permiflion, on the suspicion of illicit practices re- specting elections, to visit the house even of a magi- ftrate. By the other it was declared, that all those who were found difiributing money to the People should be confidered as enemies to their country 3.
The Senate, at the fame time, encouraged Lur- co, one of the Tribunes, to propose a new clause to corroborate the laws against bribery. By this
clause z Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvi. c. 46. Cicero ad Att. lib. i. ep. 17. 2 Cicero ad Att. lib. i. en. 16 3 Ibid.
C H A P. clause promises of money made to the People, if
. not performed, did not infer guilt; but, if per- formed, fubjeded the guilty person from thence- forward to pay to each of the Tribes an annual tax of three thousand Roman money, or about twenty-four pounds sterling; and there being thirty-five Tribes, this tax amounted in all to about eight hundred and forty pounds of our money. That the Tribune might riot be interrupted in carrying this law, the Senate farther resolved, that the formalities or reftridions of the Lex LElia and Fufial mhould not be opposed to himz. It ap- pears, however, that the liberality or other influ- ence of Pompey prevailed against these precau- tions, as Afranius was eleced, together with Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer.
Soon after the election of there officers the far- mers of the revenue of Asia, supported by the whole Equestrian order, complained, as has been mentioned, of the terms of their contract, in which they alleged that they had greatly exceeded what the funds of that province could afford, and made application to the Senate for relief. Their plea was contelted for some months with great animosity on both rides 3.
Upon the accession of the new Consuls, several other matters, tending to innovation and public disturbance, were introduced. Metellus Nepos, late Tribune, being now in the office of Praetor,
procured i These were formalitice and reflriaions provided to check the precipi- tate passing of laws.
2 Cicer. ad Atticum, lib. i. ep. i6. 3 Cicero ad Att. lib, i. rp. 17, i8.
procured a law to aboliih the customs payable at c H A P. any of the ports of Italy. The Romans, as has. X' been observed, upon the acceffibn of wealth de- rived from Macedonia, had exempted themselves from all the antient assessments, and they now completed the exemption of all the Italians from every tax besides that of. quit-rents for public lands, and the twentieth penny on the value of slaves when fold or emancipated. They were be- come the sovereigns of a great empire, and as such, thought themselves entitled to receive, not obliged to pay, contributions 1.
The Tribune Herennius, at the fame time, made a motion for an ad to enable Publius Clo- dius to be adopted into a Plebeian family, which, though an ad of a more private nature than any of the former, tended still more to embroil the parties of the Senate and the People. This sac- tious and profligate person had entertained great resentments against many of the Senators on ac- count of the prosecution he had lately incurred, and against Cicero in particular, who, having been called as an evidence on his trial, gave a very un- favourable account of his charader. The fum- mary proceedings against the accomplices of Cata- line, in which Cicero presided as Consul, exposed him to the resentment of the popular facion; and Clodius now proposed to qualify himself to be eleCted Tribune of the People, in order to wreck his vengeance on that magistrate in particular, as
well z Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. ep. 16. Dio. Cafi. is. vii. c, St.
cHAP. well as on the other abettors of the Senatorian
,'. party. The motion, however, for the present was
rejeded, though not finally dropt, either by Clodius himself, or by the popular faction, whose cause he professed to espouse '.
Two other motions were made in which Pom- pey was deeply interested: one, to ratify and con- firm all his ads in the province of Asia: another, to procure settlements for the veterans who had terved under his command. The firit, as it im- plied a refletion on Lucullus, many of whose judgments Pompey had reverted, routed this dtatef- man from the care of his household and his table, to that of the republic I. He opposed this mo- tion with vigour, and insisted that the ads of Pom- pey should be Separately examined, and not con- firmed in a tingle vote. In this he was supported by Catulus, by Cato, by the Consul Metellus, and by the Senate in general. Afranius, though vest- ed with the Consulate, and acting almost as the a- gent of Pompey, had neither dignity nor force to support filch a measure; and Pompey, finding it rejected by the Senate, declined carrying it to the People 3.
The other proposal, relating to the allotment of settlements for the soldiers of Pompey, was, by L. Flavius, one of the Tribunes, moved in the afiem- bly of the People, under the title of an Agrarian Law. In this ad, to guard against the imputation of
partiality I Dio. Caff. lib. xxxvii. c. Sr. 2 Plutarch. in Lucullo, edit. Lond. p. z97, 3 Dio. lib. xxtvii, c. 49.
partiality to any particular class, certain means of c H A.P,
XLX; relief were projected for the indigent citizens in ge-. neral ; and, to enable the commonwealth to extend its bounty, it was proposed first of all to revoke the conveyance of certain lands, which, having be- longed to the public in the Consulate of P. Mu- cius and L. Calpurnius, were fold by the Senate; and that the price [hould be restored to the pur- chafers. It was proposed, likewise, to seize cer- tain lands which had been confiscated by Sylla, but not appropriated to any particular use; and to allot, during five years, the fruits of the recent conquests in Asia to purchase settlements, which ihould be distributed in terms of this aft .
The Consul Metellus Celer, supported by the Se- nate, strenuously opposed the passing of this law. But the Tribune persisted with great obstinacy, and, to remove the obftrution he met with, committed the Consul to prison. The whole Senate would have attended him thither, and numbers accord- ingly crowded to the place, when the Tribune, veiled with the sacred defences of his person, to bar their way, planted his stool or chair of office in the door of the prison; and, having feated him- self upon it, " This way," he said, " you cannot " pass; if you mean to enter, you mutt pierce "through the walls 3 ." He declared his refolu- tion to remain all night where he fat. The par- ties were colleding their strength, and matters were
VOL. II. C c likely i Dio. lib. 1. a Cicer. lad Att. lib. i. ep To. 3 Dio. lib. xxxvii. p. £7.
c H A P. likely to end in greater extremities than'fuited tlie .XX. indirct and cautious conduc of Pompey. This
politician, although he engaged all his friends to support the motion of Flavius, affected to have no part in the measure, and now probably in secret inftruled the Tribune to remove from the doors of the prison. This at leaft:might be fufpe&ed from the sudden resolution of the Tribune, to give way, faying that he did so at the request of the prisoner, who begged for his -liierty .
It is supposed that Pompey, on this occasion, fe- verely felt the checks which his ambition received from the Senate; that he regretted, for a moment, the dismission of his army, and wished himself in condition to enforce what his craft or his artifice had not been able to obtain. The error he had committed in refignring- the sword, if he :cbnceived it-as such, might have' still been corrected by reco- vering the possession of some considerable province, which would have given him the command of an army and of proper resources to support his power. He, nevertheless, appears to have preferred the scene of intrigue in the city and the capital of the empire; a choice in which he was probably con- firmed by Cifar, who profefled great attachment to him, and who was about this time returned from the government which he held as Proprietor in Lusitania.
This officer, according to Dio, had found some pretence for a' war with the nations on the fron-
tier D.Q, lib. xxxvii. p. 5-.
tier of the Roman province; had obliged them to c ,r A F. take refuge in some of the islands on the coast, and AX, afterwards subdued them in that retreat. His objec was to return to resign his coimmand with the reputa- tion of victory, to obtain a triumph, and to offer hiri- self as a candidate for the Consulship 6f the follow- ing year. For this purpose he quitted his province without waiting for a fuccefror, and, upon his ar- rival at Rome, halted, as usual, with the ensigns of his military rank at the gates of the city, applied for a triumph, and at the fame time made interest for votes at the approaching election . The Se- nate, and the friends of the republic in general, were already become extremely jealous of his de- signs, and of his credit with the People. From a li- bertine he was become an ardent politician, seemed to have no passion but emulation or animosity to the more refpecCable orders of the State; without com- initting himself, he had abetted every factious lead- er against them, and feemned to be indifferent to consideration or honours, except so far as they led to power. Cicero and Cato were at this time the principal, or most conspicuous, members of the Senate. The first was possessed of consular rank, great ingenuity, wit, and accomplished talents: the other, pofneffed of great abilities and an in- flexible resolution, embraced the cause of the re- public with the fame ardour that others display- ed in conducing their interests or pursuing their pleasures. He had penetration enough to perceive

c HA p. in Cefar, long before the Senate in general was a-
X.X . larmed, a disposition to vilify the aristocracy, and,
in conjunction with needy and profligate citizens, to make a prey of the republic. Under this ap- prehension, he opposed him with a degree of keen- ness which Cafar endeavoured to represent as a mere personal hatred or animosity to hinmfelf.
The Senators, in general, now aware of their danger from Caesar, were disposed to refiif his ap- plications, whether made for honours or for pub- lic trufl. They, on the present occasion, disputed his pretensions to a triumph; and, while he re- mrained without the city in expectation of this ho- nour, refused, according to the forms of the com- monwealth, to admit him on the lift of candidates for the office of Consul. But the day of election being fixed, Cafar, without helitation, preferred the consulate to the triumph, laid down the en- signs of his late military character, aflumed the gown, and entered the city as a candidate for the Confulfiip '.
The People were at this time divided into a variety of factions. Pompey and Craflus diflrufted each other, and both were jealous of Cafar. Their divisions strengthened the party of the Senate, and furnifled that body with the means of thwarting separately many of their ambitious deligns. This Caesar had long perceived, and had paid his court- both to Pompey and to Crafius, in order to hinder their joining the Senate againit him. The expe-
dience I Sueton. in Cefarre, c. iS. Dio. lih, xxxv.i. c. 54.
dience of this precaution now appeared more clear- c H A 1. ly than ever, and he is supposed to have separate- xx. ly represented to these rivals the advantage which their enemies derived from their misunderstand- ing, and the ease with which, if united, they might concert among themselves all the affairs of the re- public, gratify every friend, and disappoint every enemy. Upon this representation, Pompey and Crafi'us were reconciled, and agreed to at in con- cert with Cefar, and in particular to support him in his pretensions at the approaching elecions '.
This private combination, which remained some time a secret, was afterwards, by a kind of mock- ery, called the Triumvirate, alluding to the de- fignation by which certain collegiate offices were known, derived from the numbers which were joined in the commission l. In the mean time, there leaders of supposed opposite fations, in abat- ing their violence against one another, took a fa- vourable aspet of moderation and candour. They paid their court separately to persons whom they wviihed to gain, and flattered them with hopes of being able to heal the divisions of their country. This fort of court they paid in particular to Ci- cero; and by their flatteries, and real or pretend- ed admiration of his talents, seem to have got entire possession of his mind. Pompey affected to place the merits of Cicero greatly above his own.

c H A P. " I, indeed," he said, " have served my country,
a. ," .but this man has prcferved it ." At this time
it appeaied that Ciccro, though a fine genius, was but a weak man. The Senators, with whom he had hitherto acted, were alarmed: Atticus, it seems, had taxed him with leaving his party, to commit himself into the hands of their enemies. In his anifwer to this imputation, he seems to have flattered himself that he had made an acquisition of Pompcy, not surrendered himself into his power; at leait, that he had reclaimed or diverted him from the dangerous projects in which he had been lately engaged, and that he thought himself like- ly to succeed in the fame manner with Cafar: 'b' much, that he triumphed in the- superiority of his own conduct to that of Cato, whp, by his au- iterity and vehemence, he said, had alienated the minds of men otherwise well dispose4 to the re- public W, " While I," he laid, " by a little dif- " cretion, disarm, or even reclaim its enemies 3."
Few persons, where his vanity did not blind him, were poffeifed of more penetration than Ci- cero; but it will afterwards appear how egregi- oufly he was mistaken on this occasion; he chose not to fee what checked his vain glory, or pre- vented his enjoying the court which was paid to

him by such eminent men as Pompey and Cafar. c H A P. His own importance, for the most part, intercep- '. ted every other objeCt from his view, and made him the dupe of every person who professed to admire him, and incapable of any serious regard for any one who did not pay him, on every oc- cafion, the expected tribute of praise; a defcrip- tion under which Cato, though his most sincere well-wisher and friend, appears at this time to have fallen.
Caesar, to the other arts which he employed to secure his election, added the use of money, which he obtained by joining his interest, in opposition to Bibulus, with that of Lucceius, another of the candidates possessed of great wealth. He himself having squandered his fortune, as has been ob- served, was still greatly in debt, and Lucceius willingly furnified the money that was given to the People in the name of both. This illegal proceeding, together with the menacing concerts of which he began to be fufpeded with Pompey and Crassus, greatly alarmed the friends of the republic. They determined to support Bibulus against Lucceius; and, in order to give Cafar a colleague who might occasionally oppose his dan- gerous intentions, they even went so far as to contribute fums of money, and to bid for votes as high as their opponents. In this crisis, it is said, that even Cato owned it was meritorious to bribe '.

c H A P. During the dependence of this contei, the Se- t-.-v. nate, by the death of Lutatius Catulus, was depri-
ved of an able member, and the People of a fel- low-citizen of great integrity, moderation, forti- tude, and ability; a model of what the RomanS in this age should have been, in order to have preserved the State. He partook with Cato in the aversion which Cefar bore to the most refpec- table members and best supports of the Senate, and would probably have taken part with him likewise in the continual efforts he made to maintain its au- thority. The arifocratical party, notwithstanding this loss, prevailed in carrying the election of Bi- bulus against Lucceius; and though they could not exclude Cefar from the office of Consul, they hoped, by means of his colleague, to oppose and to frustrate his designs I.
Ceiar, well aware of their purpose, opened his adminiftlration with a speech in praise of unanimity, and recommending good agreement between those who were joined in any public truit. While he meant to vilify the Senate, and to softer every dif- orderly party against them, he guarded his own behaviour, at least in the first period of his Con- fulihip, with every appearance of moderation and candour, paid his court not only to leaders of sac- tion, but to persons of every condition; and while he tookl care to espouse the popular fide in every question, was adcive likewise in devising regula- tions for the better government of the Empire: so
that I I'l;lar"ti. Appian. Dio, Sueton. &c.
that the Senate, however inclined to counteract CHAP. his designs, as calculated to raise himfelfon the XIX. ruins of the commonwealth, could scarcely, with a good grace, oppose him in any particular mea- sure. He set out with a project for the relief of such indigent citizens as had numerous families, including the veterans and disbanded soldiers of Pompey; these he proposed to fettle on some of the public lands il Italy. He gave out that he ex- peaed the concurrence of Cicero in this measure, sent him a menfage by Balbus , with assurances that he meant to consult with Pompey and himself in all matters of'importance, and that he bad hopes of briiging Crojfits also into the fame mind: words, from which it is manifest that the coalition of these persons was not yet publicly known. " What
," a fine profpea I have before me," fays Cicero to Atticus; " a perfec union with Pompey, even " with Cafar if I please; peace with my enemies, 4' and tranquility in my old age." But his heart soon after mifgave him; the honours of his for- mer life recurred to his mind. With his eminent talents, he was destined to transmit a more honest fame to posterity, and to become the lamented vicim of his country's betrayers, not the deteftate associate of their crimes 2
This Consulate is distinguished by the passing of many laws, particularly this, which was devised for the settlement of citizens on certain parts of the pu-

c H A P. blic domain; and therefore known by the title of XLX.
an Agrarian Law. On this act Cafar was to reft his popularity, and his triumph over the Senate. He gave out that he was to make a provision for twenty thousand citizens, without any burden to the revenue. But he well knew that his antago- nilts would perceive the tendency of the measure, or not susser it to pass without opposition; and he affected great moderation in the general purpose, and in framing every part of his plan; affecting iblicitude to obtain the content of the Senate; but, in reality, to make their opposition appear the more unreasonable and the more odious to the People. He declared, that he did not mean to firip the revenue of any branch that was known to carry profit to the public, nor to make any par- tial distribution in favour of his friends; that he only meant to plant with inhabitants certain un- profitable waftes, and to provide for a number of citizens, who, being indigent and uneasy in their circumitances, filled the city itself with frequent disorders and tumults; and that he would not pro- ceed a Rsep without consulting the Senate, and every perfori of credit and authority in the State.
In a way to save there appearances, and with these professions, CaSfar formed the first draught of an adt which he brought to the Senate for their approbation, and in hopes to obtain their support in proposing it to the People. It was difficult to find topics on which to oppose a measure so plau- fible, and conduted with so much appearance of
moderation
moderation and candour. But the tendency of the c H A P. as itself was evidently not to promote the peace - of the commonwealth, but to constitute a merit in the person who procured it, and to confer high measures of power on those who were to be in- trusted with its execution.
In great and populous cities indigent citizens are ever likely to be numerous, and would be more so, if the idle and profligate were taught to hope for bounties and gratuitous provisions, to quiet their clamours and to suppress their difor- ders. If men were to have estates in the country because they are fatious and turbulent in the city, it is evident that public lands, and all the refour- ces of the molt prosperous (late, would not be sufficient to supply their wants. Commissioners appointed for the distribution of such public fa- vours would be raised above the ordinary ma. giltrates, and above the laws of their country. They might reward their own creatures, and keep the citizens in general in a state of depen- dence on their will. The authors of such pro- pofals, while they were urging the State and the people to ruin, would be confidered as their only patrons and friends. " It is not this law I dread," said Cato; "it is the reward expected for obtain- " ing it."
Odious as the talk of opposition on such diffi- cult ground might appear to the People, this Se- nator did not decline it. Being asked his opinion in his turn, he answered, lThat he saw no occasion
for
c H A p. for the change that was now proposed in the state - 'T of the public domains; and entered on an argument
with which he meant so to exhaust the whole time of the fitting, as to prevent the Senate from co- ming to a question. He was entitled, by his pri- vilege as a member in that assembly, to speak with- out interruption, and might, if he chose to conti- nue speaking, persist until all the members had left the house. Cafar fufpefting his design, and fin(;ng it impoflible otherwise to lilence him, or- dem;d him into custody. The whole Senate in- itantly rose in a tumult. " Whither go you be- " fore the meeting is adjourned ?" said Caesar to Petreius, who was moving from his tide. " I go," said the other, " into confinement with Cato. (' With him a prison is preferable to a place in (' the Senate with you." The greater part of'the members were actually moving away with Cato, and Caef:r felt himself at once stript of the dif- guise of moderation he had assumed, and dreaded the spirit which he saw rising in to numerous a body of men, who, on former occasions, had main- tained their authority with a vigour too fatal to those who opposed it. He had relied on their want of decision, and on their ignorance of their own strength. But his rashness broke the charm. He wished that the prisoner would procure some friend among the Tribunes to interpose; but Ca- to, fceing him embarrassed, and the Senate enga- ged in the cause, went off in the custody of the LiACor w ithout any signs of reluctance. Cafar
immediately
immediately recolleting himself, and never hur- cHA P. ried too far by any passion, dispatched a Tribune x . of his own party with secret directions to rescue the prisoner; and this being done, the Senators again returned to their places. " I meant," said Caesar, " to have submitted this law to your judg- " ment and correction; but if you throw it aside, "the People ihall take it up '."
Caesar, upon this occasion, increased his own popularity, and diminished that of his enemies in the Senate, who were supposed in this, as in some other instances, to withfland with keenness every measure that was devised for the comfort of the People. The imputations cast out against him by Cato and others, were supposed to proceed from malice or cynical prejudices. Hc found himself itrong enough to extend his bounty to the People, so as to comprehend the lands of Campania, which were hitherto confidered as unalienable, and the richest demesne of the public, together with a valuable diftrit near the confluence of the Vul- turnus and the Sabbatus, formerly consecrated to pious uses.' In these valuable tracts of land there was sufficient subjec for an ample provision for the soldiers of Pompey, and for the retainers of those who, together with CrafTus and Caesar him- self, were proposed to be commiflioners for carry- ing this law into execution.
At the firit assembly of the People, Cefar .pro- poscd his scheme to impropriate the lands of Cam-

Caesar next called upon Pompey, though in a private station; and the audience, ignorant of the concert into which these leaders had enter- ed, were impatient to hear this oracle on the sub- jed of a measure which was likely to elevate a supposed rival so high in the favour of the People. To the surprise of all who were present, Pompey applauded the general design, and, in a speech of considerable length, difcufled all the clauses of the ad, and with great approbation of each. When he had done speaking, Cxefar, alluding to what had dropt from his colleague, and affecting to fear the interposition of force; " Will you support us," he said to Pompey, " in cafe we are attacked ?"- "If any one," said the other, " shall lift up a " sword against you, I shall lift up both sword " and fllield.'." Crassus being called upon, also spoke to the fame effect. The concurrence of all these leaders portended the unanimous consent of all parties; and a day being fixed for finally deciding the quellion, the assembly adjourned.
To oppose a measure so popular, and from which such numbers had great expectations, no means remained so likely to succeed as superstition. To

this aid Bibulus accordingly had recourse, and, by c IH AP.
XIX. virtue of the authority with which he was veiled, _-· proclaimed a general fait, and a suspension for the present year of all the affairs of State. The design of this suspension, and the extravagant length of time to which it was extended, probably enabled his colleague to treat it with contempt, and to proceed in the design of putting his question, as if no such proclamation had been issued. The assembly was accordingly summoned in the temple of Concord. Ciefar, early in the morning, secured all the ave- nues and the steps of the portico, where he had Vatinius, ohe. of the Tribunes of the People, who was entirely devoted to his interest, and'even in his pay ', stationed with a party, arid prepared to take the odium of all violent measures on him- self. Bibulus, however, attended by numbers of the Senate, and three of the Tribunes, who were engaged, by their negative, to put a flop to every proceeding, came into the place of assembly, with all the forrs of office, and protested against the legality of any meeting to be held in a time of general fast; but the oppolite party being in posses- lion of the temple, forced him from the fleps, broke the ensigns of the Lidors, wounded the Tribunes who interposed in his defence, and effedually re- moved all farther obftrudion to their own designs. The question then being put, the law pailed with-

This oath was probably a snare laid by Caesar for the most resolute of his opponents, like that which had been formerly laid by Marius, on a like occasion, for Metellus Numidicus, and by means of which that virtuous citizen was actually for some time removed from the commonwealth 1.
Metellus Celer, the late Consul, together with Cato and Favonius, unaware of the fiare which was laid for them, at first declared their resolution not to swear to the observance of any such ruin- ous law; but, on farther deliberation, they be- came sensible that in this they were serving the cause of their enemies. " You may have no need "of Rome," said Cicero, now awake from his dream, to Cato, "' and may go into exile with " pleasure; but Rome has need of you. Give " not such a victory to her enemies and your own°" Upon view of the matter, it was determined to comply 2.
Bibulus, on the day following that of his vio- lent expulsion from the assembly of the People, convened the Senate, represented the outrage he had received, and submitted the state of the re- public to their consideration. But even this as- fembly, though confiting of above fix hundred of the most powerful citizens of Rome, not destitute

" They appear," said Cicero upon this oc- cafion, " to think, that even if the republic should " perish, they will be able to preserve their fiih- "ponds."
The Consul Bibulus, even Catoi though far re- moved from any ambiguity of condut;, saw no pof- fibility of withitanding the torrent. The first re- tired to his own house, and from thenceforward during the remainder of his term in office, did.not personally appear in his public character, and even Cato absented himfelf-from the SenateI.
While Cefar engrossed the full exercise of the consular power, Bibulus was content with issuing his edicts or manifestos in writing, containing pro- tests, by which he endeavoured to flop all proceed- ings in public affairs on account of the religious fast, or continuation of holidays, which, according to the forms of the commonwealth, he had infti- tuted to restrain his colleague. In these writings, he published violent invecives against Cafar, in which, among other articles, he charged him with having had a part in the conspiracy of Cataline 2, The Tribune Vatinius, in return, issued a warrant to commit the Consul Bibulus to prison; and, in order to seize his person, attempted to break into

H A P. his house; but in this he was foiled, and the par- ,_'. ties continued, during the remainder of this Con-
fulate, in the fame situation with refpe6t to each other.
In dating the year, initead of the Consulate of Caxfar and Bibulus, it was called by some wag the Consulate of Julius and Cfar '. This able ad- venturer, though fufpeted of the deepcRf designs, went fill deeper in laying his measures for the ex- ecution of them than his keenest opponents sup- posed. He found means to tie up every hand that was likely to be lifted up againfl himself; as those of Pompey and Crafius, by their secret agreement, of which the articles were gradually disclosed in the effect.. le confirmed to Pompey all the ads of his administration in Asia, and, by putting him on the commission for dividing the lands of Cam- pania, and for fettling a colony at Capua, gave him an opportunity, which the other earnestly desired, of providing for many necessitous citizens of his party. He flattered Craftus sufficiently, by pla- cing him on the fame commiflion, and by admit- ting him to a supposed equal participation of that political consequence which the Triumvirs propo- fed to secure by their union. He gained the E- queftrian order, by granting a suit which they had long in dependence, for a diminution of the rents payable by the revenue farmers in Asia T. These he reduced a third and by this at, acquired with
that : Sueton. in C. Cxefare, c. lo. Dio. Caf lib. xxxvii. c. 6. 8. , Cicero ad Att. lib ii. ep. x, Appian. de Bell. Civil lib. ii. p. 43e.
that order of men the character of great liberality e H A P. and candour. He himself was the only person . x'x who, in appearance, was not to profit by these ar- rangements. He was occupied, as his retainers gave out, in serving the republic, and in promot- ing his friends; was the general patron of the distressed and the indigent, and had nothing to propose for himself.
With his content, and under his authority, Fu- fius, one of the Pretors, and Vatinius, one of the Tribunes, obtained two laws, both of them equi- table and salutary: the firit, relating to the use of the ballot in the Comitia, or assembly of the Peo- ple: the other, relating to the challenge of par- ties in the nomination of judges or juries. The introduction of the ballot in political questions had greatly weakened the influence of the aristocracy over the determinations of the People; and refo- lutions were frequently carried in this manner, which no party, nor any particular order of men, were willing to acknowledge as their measure. The Nobles imputed absurd determinations to the majority which was formed by the People, and there in their turn retorted the imputation. To leave no doubt in such matters for the future, Fu- fius proposed, that the separate orders of Patrician, Equestria'n, and Plebeian, ihould ballot apart'. This regulation had some tendency to reRfore the influence of the superior clafIes.

Cafar himself was busy in devising new regula- tions to reform the mode of elections, and to im- prove the forms of business in some of the pub- lic departments. By one of his ads the. priests were to be eleted agreeably to the former laws of Atius and Domitius, with this difference, that can- didates might be admitted even in absence. By another of his ads, regular journals were to be! kept in the Senate and in the assemblies of the People, and all their proceedings recorded for the infpetion of the public. By a third, persons con- vicded of treason were fubjeded to new penalties, and governors of provinces-to additional restraints, in the exercise of their power. Such officers were not allowed to receive any honorary gift from their provinces, until their services being confidered at Rome, were found to have entitled them to a tri- umph }. They were restrained from encroaching on the right of any State or principality beyond the limits of their province. They were obliged to leave copies of their books. and of their ads at two of the principal towns in their government 3, and, immediately upon their arrival at Rome, to give in a copy of the fame accounts to the trea-

fury. They were doomed to make reflitution of c HA P. all fubjets received in extortion, not only by them- XIX. selves, but by any of their attendants .
With these adts Caesar adorned his Consulate, and in tome measure difcountenanced the party which was disposed to traduce him. He is, ne- verthelefs, accused of having stolen from the trea- fury, to which he had access in the capacity of Consul, bars of gold weighing three thousand pondo, and of having concealed the theft by sub- tituting brass gilt, and of the fame form, in its stead 2.
Whatever foundation there may have been for this report, it soon appeared that Caesar had ob- jedts of a more serious nature, could copy, on oc- cafion, the example of Pompey, and, in his man- ner, cause what was personal to himself to be pro- posed by others, whom he might be free to support or difavowv according to the reception which his proposal fllould meet from the public. It cannot be doubted that he now conceived the design of ha- ving a military force, ifneceffary to support his pre. tensions in the city. Hitherto kingly power be- ing odious at Rome, whoever had aspired to it had always perilhed in the attempt, and the mere im- putation, however supported, was fatal.

c r A P. or unwilling to support their demagogues to this
XIX. .XI. extent; and the People in general became jealous
of their most refpedable citizens, when it appear- ed that merit itself approached to monarchical elevation. Marius, by the continued possession of the highest offices, and by the supreme command of armies, had acquired a species of sovereignty which he knew not how to resign. Cinna came into partnership with Marius, and wished to go- vern after his decease. Sylla, to avenge his own wrongs and those of his friends, to cut off a profli- gate faction, and restore the republic, took pof- session of the government. He led his army againfi usurpers, and had the power to become himself the most successful usurper, as he was put in possession of a sovereignty which he no doubt might have retained. So far in him, therefore, every ambi- tious adventurer found a model, and was inftruc- ted in the means which could insure to a tingle person the sovereignty of Rome. Cataline, with his accomplices Lentulus and Cethegus, by means of a profligate party among the populace or citi- zens of desperate fortune, had vainly attempted to overturn the State, or usurp its government 1. Ce- far was become head of the fame party; but an army like that of Sylla, a convenient station, and the resources of a great province, were neceflary to support the contest, and to carry it against his
rivals, x Speaking of the imaginary danger to a State of being overturned by the rabble; wre rr.ight as much fear, said a witty writer of the present age, that h city would be drowned by the overflowing of its own kennels.
rivals, as well as against the republic itself, to any c H A P.
XI. favourable iflle.
The republic had taken many precautions to prevent the introdulion of military power at Rome. Although the functions of State and of war were intrusted to the fame persons, yet the civil and military characters, except in the cafe of a Dictator, were never united at once in the fame person. The officer of State resigned his civil power before he became a soldier, and the soldier was obliged to lay aside his military ensigns and character before he could enter the city; and if he sued for a triumph in his military form, muff remain without the walls till that suit was dif- cuffed. The command of armies and of pro- vinces in the person of any officer was limited to a tingle year at a time, at the end of which, if the commission were not expressly prolonged, it was understood to expire, and to devolve on a fuccef- for named by the Senate.
That no leader of party might have an army at hand to overawe the republic, no military fta- tion was Iuppofed to exist within the limits of Italy. The purpose, however, of this precaution was in some measure frustrated by the situation of a province in which an army was kept with- in the Alps. Italy was understood to extend on. ly from the sea of Tarentum to the Arnus and the Rubicon: beyond these boundaries, on the northwef, all those extensive and rich tracts on both fides of the Apennines, and within the Alps,
D d 4 which
c i A P. which now make the dutchies of Ferrara, Bologna, x- ' Modeno, Milan, the States of Piedmont and Ve-
nice, with the dutchy of Carniola, and the whole of Lombardy, and part of Tuscany, were con- fidered, not as Italy, but as a province termed the Cisalpine Gaul, and, like the other Roman pro- vinces, was to be held by a military officer, sup- ported by an army.
This then was the most commodious flation at which a political adventurer might unite the great- eft advantages, that of having an army at his com- mand, and that of being so near the city of Rome, as not only to influence the public councils, but to be able also, by surprise, to occupy the feats of government whenever his designs were ripe for such an attempt.
Sylla had an army devoted to his pleasure; but, having the seas of Asia and Ionia to pass in his *way to Italy, could not, without giving an alarm from a great distance, and without putting his ene- mies on their guard, approach to the capital. He therefore, when he had this object in view, made no secret of his purpose.
Cxefar, from his native disposition, could not re- train his ambition short of the sovereignty, and without any signal incitement or singular circum- fiances, like those of Sylla, was prepared to obtain it. He arranged his measures like the plan of a cam- paign, which he had ability to digest, and the pa- tience to execute with-the greatest deliberation. He

The Cisalpine Gaul, or that part of Italy which extended from the Rubicon.to the Alps, was thus peculiarly suited to the purpose of Caesar. But the diftribution.of the provinces was fRill within the prerogative of the Senate; and the provincial governments were filled by their nomination, in pursuance of an express regulation afcxibed to Caius Gracchus, and known, from his name, by the title. of the Sempronian Law'. Caesar had ever been at variance with the greater part of the Senate. In the office of Prxtor he had been fu- spended by their authority. In his present office of Consul he had set them at open defiance. He had no profped of being able to obtain from them the choice he had made of a province; and- the proposal to put him in polteffion of the Cisalpine Gaul for a term of years, joined to the preceding parts of his conduc, would have given a general alarm, and opened at once the whole extent of his dlcign.
It . - Lex Scinproi:,, Vid. vol. . ii. c 10.
;CH A . It was necefTary, therefore, in order to obtain ,x. m this object, to set aside the authority of the Senate,
and to procure his nomination by some degree of surprise. The Tribune Vatinius accordingly, upon u rumour that the Helvetii, or the nations inha- biting the tracs or valleys from Mount Jura to the Alps, were likely to cause some commotion on the frontier of Gaul, moved the People to set aside the law of Sempronius, and, by virtue of their own transcendent authority, to name Cafar as Proconsul of the Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years, with an army of three legions. The senatorian party, as might have been expected, were greatly alarmed at this proposal. Theyvainly, however, hoped to evade it by substituting another appointment for Caesar in place of this province. It was proposed to make him fuperintendant of the public forests throughout the empire; a charge which, though not, in our acceptation of the word, a province, was however, like every other public department in that empire, known by this name. This substitute for the government of the Cisalpine Gaul was thought to be the better chosen, that it neither implied nor required the command of an army, and was to withhold the engine of military power from a person so likely to abuse it. This weak attempt, however, against so able an adversary, only tended to expose the meaning of those by whom it was made, and by shewing to the Senate their own weakness, hurried them into concessions which perhaps might have been other-
wife
wife avoided. In order that Csefar might not owe c H A P. every thing to the People and nothing to them, Ix. they extended his command at once to both fides of the Alps. On the one fide of these mountains he had a station from which to overawe the city: on the other, he had a great extent of territory, and a theatre of war on which he might form an army and inure them to service. The Senate, feeing he had already, by a vote of the People, obtained the first with an army of three legions for five years; and imagining that it was no lon- ger of any use to oppose him; or hoping to oc- cupy his attention, or to wear out the five years of his command in wars that might arise beyond the Alps, they joined to his province on the Po that of the Transalpine Gaul also, with an addi- tional legion. In this manner, whether from there or any similar motives, it is affirmed by some of the historians ', that the Senate even outran the People in concessions to Cafar; and to this occa- sion is referred the memorable faying of Cato " Now you have taken to yourselves a king, and " have placed him with his guards in your Ci- " tadel ."
Caesar, at the fame time, on the motion of the Tribune Vatinius, was empowered to fettle a Ro- man colony on the Lake Larius at Novum Co- mum, with full authority to confer the privilege

C H A P. of Roman citizens on those he ihould fettle in this x x place. Having obtained the great object of his
Consulate, in his appointment for a term of years to the command of an army within the Alps, he no longer kept any measures with the Senate, nor allowed them any merit in the advantages he had gained. He was aware of their malice, he said, and had prevailed in every suit, not by their con- cession, but in direct opposition to their will, Though capable of great command of temper, and of the deepest dissimulation when in pursuit of his objec, he appears, on this and other occasions to have had a vanity which he idly indulged, in braving the world when his end was obtained 1. As he insulted the Senate when no longer depend- ing on their consent for any of his objects, so he no longer disguised his conned ion with Pompey and Craflus, or the means by which, in his late measures, the concurrence of there rivals had been obtained.
. As such combinations and cabals generally have an invidious aspect to those who are excluded from them, the Triumvirate, for so it began to be cal- led in detetfation and irony 2, notwithifanding the popularity or influence enjoyed by those who had formed it, became an objcc2 of aversion and gene- ral abuse 3.

XIX. ator, performing on the public theatre, applied to _xl. - Pompey the Great, a sentence of reproach, which occurred in the part he was ating. The applica- tion was received with peals of applause, and call. ed for again and again .
The edidts that were published by Bibulus in opposition to Csefar were extolled, and received with avidity. The places of the fireets at which they were pofled up were so crowded with mul- titudes assembled to read them, that the ways were obftruated. Caesar and Pompey endeavoured to lessen the effe& of there edicts in speeches to the People, but were ill heard. Pompey loft his tem- per and his spirit, and funk in his consideration as much as Caesar advanced in power. It became manifest, even to the People, that Caesar was the only gainer by this coalition, that he had procured it for his own conveniency 2; but Pompey him- self probably felt that he was too far advanced to recede.
The Senate, and all the most refpetable citi- zens of Rome, though unanimous in their detefta- tion of the design that was formed by Caesar, Pom- pey, and Crassus, to dispose of the republic at their pleasure, yet either were, or believed themselves,
unable i " To our misfortune thou art great." He was called upon to repeat these' words again and again innumerable times. " The time will come ' when thou flalt rue this State ;" likewise repeated with peals of applause, P-c. Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. epift. 19. Val. Max. lib. vi. c. 2.

c H A P. unable to cope with the power of so many faaions
XIX, united. Cefar, in order to hold by force what he
gained by artifice, and by some degree of surprise, filled the streets with his retainers in arms, and showed, that, in cafe of any attempt to recal what had been so weakly given up to him, he was in condition to reift, and to lay the city in blood. If he were driven from Rome, he had provided within the Alps an army of two or three complete legions, with which he could maintain his pro- vince, or even recover his poieffion of the city. Every one censured, complained and lamented; but there was little concert, and less vigour, even among the members of the Senate.
Cato, with his declared disapprobation of the late measures, was reduced to the iingle expedient of assisting Bibulus in drawing up the edits or ma. nifeflos against. the proceedings of Caesar, which, as has been mentioned, were at this time receiv- ed with so much avidity by the People.
Cicero now declined taking part in any affair of State; but being known for an advocate of the greatest ability, was courted in this capacity by many citizens, who had affairs in dependence be- fore the courts of justice; but apprehending an attack which was likely to be made upon himself, on account of the tranfa&ions of his Consulate, he avoided, as much as possible, giving offence to any of the parties which divided the commonwealth. The florm was to be direced against him by Pub- lius Clodius, under whose animosity to the govern-
ment
rment of the Nobles, and to Cicero in particular, CHAP. it was perceived for some time to be gathering'. XX.
This bustling profligate having, in the former year, in order that he might be qualified for Tri- bune of the People, got himself adopted into a Plebeian family, could not obtain the necefiary ratification of the deed of adoption in the assembly of the Curiae, until his cause was espoused by Ca:- far, who seems to have taken his part, in resent. ment of some insinuations thrown out against him. self by Cicero in pleading for M. Antonius, his late colleague in the Consulate. Antonius being, as has been mentioned, on account of his admini- ftration in Macedonia, accused of extortion, was defended by Cicero, who took that occasion to la- ment the state of the republiC, brought under sub- jedion as it was by a cabal which ruled by vio- lence, and in contempt of the laws. Caesar was greatly provoked at these expressions: " This per- ' son," he said, " takes the fame liberty to vilify ~' the reputation of others, that he takes to extol " his own;" and confidering this speech as a warn- ing of the part which Cicero was likely to take in his absence, he determined not to leave him at the head of the Senatorian party to operate against him. His defiru&ion might be effeaed merely by expediting the formality of Clodius's adoption in- to a Plebeian family, to qualify him for Tribune of the People '; and Cxaer, on the very day in

Pompey likewise. Concurred in .executing. this deed of adoption for Clodius, and assisted ill the quality of Augur to carry it through the religious forms. Clodius, in the mean time, gave out, that he had no design on the Tribunate, but was.foli. citing' an embassy to Tigtanes. king of Armenia. Cicero was so much blinded by this pretence, that he was merry in. his letter to Atticus on the ab- furdity of Clodius, in having himself degraded in- to a Plebeian, merely to. qualify him to appear at the court of Tigranes. He was merry likewise with his not being put on the commiflion of twenty for the execution of Cefar's Agrarian Law. " Strange !" he said, " that he who was once the
only male creature in Cefar's house, cannot now "find one place among twenty in the lift of his " friends I."
The more effectually to impose upon Cicero and his friends, Caesar affected to believe, that the in- tention of Clodius was against himself, and taken up with the animosity of a person who had al- ready attempted to dishonour his house a; and he pretended to dispute the validity of his adoption, and of consequence, his qualification to be elected a Tribune. Pompey joined also in the fame vile artifice. " Nay," fays Cicero, upon hearing of
"their I Cicero ad Att. lib. ii. epift. 7. 2 In the intrigue with Cefar's wife.
their pretended opposition to Clodius, "this is CH AP. ' vexation merely. Send but the proper officers to xx. "me, and I will make oath, that Pompey told me "himself he had aflifced as Augur in passing that " decree '.
With these tranfaaions the year of Cafar's Cori- fulate drew to a close. He ratified his treaty with Pompey, by giving him his daughter Julia in mar- riage. During the former part of the year, this lady had been promised to Setvilius Caepio, and had been of gteat use to her father, by securing the services of Caepio againht Bibulus. But now it was found more expedient to attach Pompey, and Servilius, on his disappointment, was pacified by tie promise of Pompey's daughter. Cafar himself married the daughter of Calpurnius Pifo, who, together with Gabinius, the creature of Pom- pey, was deflined to succeed in the Consulate, and who was, by this alliance, secured in the interest of Caesar. " Provinces, armies, and kingdoms," said Cato on this occasion, " are made the dowries " of women ', and the empire itself an appendage " of female prostitution."
In this situation of affairs, and among parties who dealt in impositions and artifices, as well as in open and daring measures, some particulars are re- corded, which, to gain our belief, require some ac- quaintance with the intrigues of popular facion. Yettius, a citizen of some note, who had been em-

XLX. ^S \_gain intelligence of the Cataline conspiracy, now
himself appeared as the author of a plot, of which the origin and the issue were matter of various conjecture. Knowing that Curio, a young man of high rank, and a declared enemy of Caesar, was on bad terms likewise with Pompey, Vettius told him in confidence, that he himself had determined to assassinate Pompey, and proposed to Curio to join with him in that design. The young man com- municated the matter to his father, and the father to Pompey, who laid it before the Senate. Vet- tius being examined in the Senate, at first denied any intercourse with Curio, but afterwards con- sessed, that he had been drawn into a conspiracy in which this young man, was concerned with Lu- cullus, Brutus, Bibulus, and rome others, who had formed a design on Pompey's life.
It was fufpeted, that Cafsar had employed Vet- tius to pretend this design against Pompey, and by opening himself to these persons to engage some of them in a concert with himself; and that it was intended, as foorl as he had laid some founda- tion for an imputation of guilt against any of them, that he should, attended by a party of slaves, armed with daggers, put himself in the way of being ta- ken; that he should at first deny the plot, but after- wards susser himself to be forced, by degrees, to confess, and to declare his accomplices; but that this plan was difconderted by the early intimation which Curio gave to his father, before all the cir-
cumftances
cumftances projected to give it an air of probabi- c A A P. lity were in readiness. xIX.
It cas scarcely credible, however, that Cefar lhould have committed his reputation to the ha- zard of detecion in so infamous a project. He laid hold of it indeed with some avidity, and en- deavoured to turn it against his opponents. After Vettius had been examined before the Senate, and was committed to prison for farther examination, Cafar presented him to the People, and brought him into the rofira, to declare what he knew of this pretended most bloody design. The prisoner repeated his confession, but varied in the account of his accomplices, particularly in leaving Brutus out of the lift; a circumfiance likewise, in the scandal of the times, imputed to the partiality of Caesar, and confidered as proof of his clandefline relation to this young man. Vettius was remanded to prison, and a process commenced against him on the flatute of intended assassination. A trial muff have probably disclosed the whole scene, and for this reason was said to have been prevented, by the sudden death of Vettius, who was fippofed to have been strangled, by order of Cafar, in prison'.
By the influence of Pompey and Caesar, Gabi- u. c. 6pg. nius and Pifo were eleted Consuls; and, by their nius pi'o connivance, Clodius became Tribune of the People. Cefonnus, The ascendant they had gained, however, was ex- 4P0,- tremely disagreeable to many of the other officers of State, and even to some of the Tribunes. L.

lus, joined in a prosecution against Caesar, late Con- ful, for proceedings in office contrary to law and religion. Cefar, for some time, affected to join issue with them on the questions proposed, and to submit his cause to judgment; but at last, appre- hending delay and trouble, without any advantage from such an inquiry, he pleaded his privilege as a person destined for public service; and ac- cordingly, without flaying to answer the charge which was laid against him, withdrew from the city, continued to make his levies, and to afiemble an army in the suburbs of Rome. In this posture of affairs, one of the Quaestors, who had served under Caesar in his Consulship, was conviced of some misdemeanor 1; and the opposite party, as if they had of a sudden broke the chains in which they were held, commenced suits againit all the tools that had been employed by him in his late violent measures. Gabinius had been charged with bribery by Caius Cato, then a young man. But the Praetor, whose lot it was to exercise the jurifdic'ion in such cafes, being under the influence of Pompey, evaded the q.uestion. Caius Cato com- plained to the People, and, in stating the cafe, ha- ving said that Pompey usurped a Dicdatorial power, so far incensed part of his audience, that he nar- rowly escaped with his life '.
Vatinius, the late mercenary Tribnne, was ac- cufed before the Praetor Memmius, who willing-

ly received the accusation; but all proceedings in c HA P. the matter were suddenly flopped by the interpo- , sition of Clodius in his new situation; and the at- tention of the People and of the Senate soon as- terwards came to be more intensely occupied with the designs of this factious Tribune himself, than with any other business whatever.
The ruin of Cicero appears to have been the prin- cipal objec which Clodius proposed to himself in soliciting the office which he now held; and this, though affecting to be of the popular party, he pursued chiefly from motives of personal animofi- ty and resentment. Cicero had given evidence against him on his late trial, and afterwards in the Senate made him the objet of his wit and invecive 1. He is generally represented as effe- minate and profligate, void of discretion or pru- dence. On the present occasion, however, he seems to have managed with considerable fteadi- ness and address. He aated evidently in concert with Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus; but probably had not from them any particular direction in what manner he was to proceed.
Ever since the summary proceedings which were employed against the accomplices of Cataline, the danger of this precedent was a favourite topic with the popular faction. Clodius profefled that the whole object of his Tribunate was to provide a guard against such dangers for the future. He began with paying his court to the different par-
Ee 3 ties : Cicer. ad Att. lib. x,
c H A P. ties and different orders of men in the republic, by ax proposing such ads as were favourable to each; and
he itated his motion for better securing the People againit arbitrary executions, without any applica- tion to Cicero, as but one of many regulations in- tended by him for the benefit of the public, and which he joined with some acs of gratification to private persons. He gained the present Consuls by procuring them lucrative appointments, at the expiration of their year in office; to Pifo, Mace- donia including Achaia; to Gabinius, Syria with a considerable addition beyond the usual bounds of that province . He gained the indigent part of the People by an ad to remit all the debts which were due for corn at the public granaries; and by ordering, for the future, gratuitous diftri- butions to be made from thence2. He, at the fame time, procured another at extremely agree- able to many of the citizens, for restoring and in- creasing the number of incorporated Societies, which had been abolished about nine years before, on ac- count of the troubles to which they gave rife.
The operation of corporate bodies, in a city so much addided to fadion and tumult, had been the cause of frequent disorders. As persons, asseting to govern the State, endeavoured 'to gain the People by indulging their humour in idleness and diffipa- tion, with games, theatrical entertainments, com- bats of gladiators, and the baiting of wild beasts;
so 1 Plutarch. in Cicerone. 2 Padianus in Pifoniana. Dio. lib. xxxviii. Cicer. pro Domo fua,
so the head of every corporate body, though upon c i A r. a smaller tcale, had his feasts, his entertainments, M . and shews, forming to himself a party of retainers, on occasion, to be employed as his facion might require. The renewal, therefore, of such efta- blifhmcnts, a mreafure which carried to every am- bitious tradefnman in his flall the feeling and con- sequence of a Crassus, a Pompey, or a Cafar, as- feding to govern the world in their refpetive ways, was greedily adopted by the lower People. And Clodius took occasion, in the first ardour of fuchcorporate meetings, to foment and to dired their zeal to his own purpose . He even gained a considerable party in the Senate, by affecting to circumscribe the discretionary power of the Cen- fors in purging their rolls. Many of the mem- bers had reason to dread the Censorial anmmadver- lions, and were pleased with an ad which this Tribune obtained to provide, that, for the future, no one could be ffruck off the lift of the Senate without a formal trial, and the concurrence of both the Censors ".
Joined to so many arts pradtifed to reconcile dif- ferent parties to the mcafures he affecded to take for the security of the People, Clodius promulga- ted his law of provision againif arbitrary execu- tions, and gave it a retrofped, which was undoubt- edly meant to comprehend the uirlmary proceed- ings which had been held against Cethegus and

H A P. Lentulus, in the Consulate of Cicero. While the x - subjed was under consideration, he thought of two
circumitanccs which might operate againit his de- sign, and which he was therefore determined to pre- vent. One was, the practice of recurring to the celestial auspices, by which the proceedings of the People were sometimes suspended; and the other was, the opposition which he might expet from Marcus Cato, who was likely to confider the cause of the Senate and the republic as involved in that of the magistrate, who had preserved the State by executing their decrees. To secure himself against the firit, he procured an ediA to prohibit all per- sons from observing the heavens while the People were deliberating on any affair of State; and to obviate the second, he thought of a pretence for a temporary removal of Cato from Rome.
In the preceding Consulate, Cato, though arm- ed as he was solely with the reputation of inte- grity, unable to prevent the progress of a ruinous faction affecting popular measures, yet, by his unre- mitted opposition, he had forced them, on occasion, to show what Pompey in particular was extremely desirous to conceal, that they prevailed by corrup- tion and force, not by what they pretended, the free choice of their fellow-citizens. Clodius, foresee. ing if Cato remained at Rome, a like opposition, and possibly a disappointment in his design againa Cicero, devised a commission to employ him in so- reign service. Ptolomy, king of Cyprus, had put a personal affront on Clodius, by refusing to pay
'his
his ransom when taken by pirates on the coast of c H A P. Asia near to that island. But now, in the wretched x.vX Condition of nations, depending on the will of a single profligate citizen, he took an opportunity to be revenged on this prince, by procuring an aa to forfeit his kingdom and his treasure; and by making Cato the instrument of his revenge, he pro- posed to free himself at the fame time from the in- terruption which this citizen was likely to give to his projeCts in the city .
At an interview with Cato, Clodius had the im- pudence to pretend great admiration of his virtue; told him, that the commiflion to reduce Cyprus into the form of a province was solicited by ma- ny; but that he knew of none who, by his faith- fulness and integrity, was so well qualified for the trust as Cato, and that he meant to propose him to the People. " That," said Cato, " I know is a " mere artifice; not an honour, but an indignity ( intended to me." " Nay," said Clodius, " if " you do not go willingly, you shall go by force ;" and on that very day moved and obtained his no- mination from the People. Left the affair of Cy- prus ihould not detain him a sufficient time, he was farther charged in his commission to repair to Byzantium, to restore some exiles, and to quiet some troubles which had arisen in that place.
Cafar and Pompey likewise concurred in pro- curing this commission to Cato, in order to remove a powerful support from the Praetors Memmius
and ; Cicero pro Sextio.
c H A P. and Domitius, whose proposal to repeal all the adC --X.- of Caesar was yet in suspense.
The storm was now ready to burit upon the magiffrate who had presided in the suppression of Cataline's faction, and no man had any doubt of its dire&ion. Cato, before he left Rome, feeing Caesar in possession of the gates with an army, and ready, in the event of any tumult, under pretence of repressing disorders, to enter the city by force, and to seize on the government; or apprehending, that the cause in queflion, however just, was al- together desperate, earnestly exhorted Cicero, ra- ther to yield and to withdraw from the city, than to bring matters to extremities in the present slate of the republic T.
Cicero, however, was for omne time undecided. Having secured the support of L. Ninius Quadra- tus, one of the Tribunes, he proposed to obftrua the proceedings of his enemy, by opposing the negative of a colleague, to all his motions. After- wards, upon afurances from Clodius, that the pur- pose of the aa was altogether general, and had no special relation to himself; he was prevailed on not to divide the college of Tribunes, nor to en- gage his friends in the invidious task of giving the negative to a law, which was intended merely to guard the People for the future against arbitra- ry proceedings 2.
But Clodius, having thus made way for the de- claratory at, which he had drawn up in general
terms, I Plutarch. in Catone. T Dio. lib. xxxviii, c. I4.
terms, no longer made any secret of his design- a- c H A P. gainft the magistrate, who had dared to order the X execution of Lentulus and Cethegus, and boasted of the concurrence of Cafar and Pompey. In this neither of these professed friends of Cicero denied the imputation ; but excused themselves in private by pleading, that while their own acts of the preceding year were fill quefioned by the Praetor, it was necessary for them to keep terms with so violent a tribune as Clodius2; and Pom- pey, together with this apology for his prefeni conduct, gave Cicero the strongest assurances of future protection. " This Tribune," he said, ,' ihall kill me before he injure you." It is not credible that Pompey then meant to betray a per- son for whom he professed so much friendfiip; it was sufficiently base that, in the sequel, he did not perform his promise. On the contrary, when his aid came to be most wanted by his injured friend, he retired to the country, under pretence of business ; and being at his villa near Alba, where Lentulus, Lucullus, and many of the most refpedable Sena- tors repaired to him with the warmest intreaties in behalf of a person to whose eloquence and panegy- ric he owed so many of his honours, he coldly re- ferred them to the ordinary officers ofState for protection, faying, That as a private citizen he could not contend with a furiousTribune at the head of an armed People .>.

CH A P. In the mean time, the Consul Gabinius, though
xix.
under the absolute diretion of Pompey, promoted the attack againit Cicero, and checked every at- tempt that was made in his favour. When the Equefirian order, together with numbers of the muoiL iipedable citizens from every quarter of Italy, crowded in mourning to Rome, and present- ed a memorial to the Senate in his behalf; and when the members of the Senate itfeli proposed to take mourning, and to intercede with the Peo- .ple, Gabmius suddenly left the chair, broke up the meeting, went directly from thence to the assembly of the People, where he threw out injurious infi- nuations against the Senate, and mentioned the meetings which had been held by the Equestrian order, as bordering on sedition and riot; said, that the Knights ought to be cautious how they revi- ved the memory of that part which they them- selves had acted in the violent measures which were now coming under review, and which were so likely to meet with a just retribution from the People of Rome.
In this extremity Cicero attempted to fee Pom- pey in person at his country house; but while the suppliant was entering at one door, this treach- erous friend withdrew at another'. No longer doubting that he was betrayed by a person on whom he had so fully relied, he began to be agi- tated by a variety of counsels and projects. He was invited by Caesar to place himself in the fla-
tion Plutarch. in Cicerone.
tion of lieutenant in his province of Gaul; and, in c H AP that public charader abroad, to take refuge from XIX. the fiorm that was gathering against him in Italy. But this, from a person who had so much contri- buted to raise the storm, was supposed to proceed from a design to insult or betray him; or at best to reduce him to a fate of dependence on himself. Being attended by a numerous body of citizens, chiefly of the Equestrian order, who had taken arms in his cause, he Sometimes had thoughts of defending himself by force; at other times, he funk in despair, and, as appears from his letters, proposed to die by his own hands; an intention from which he was diverted only by the entreaties and anxious care of his friends.
Such was the state of affairs, when Clodius as- fembled the People to pass the act he had framed againfi arbitrary executions. He had summoned them to meet in the suburbs, that Cafar, who on account of his military command was then exclu- ded from the city, might be present. This artful politician being called upon among the first to de- liver his opinion, with an appearance of modera- tion, and unwillingness to bear hard on any per- son to whom the law might apply, referred the People to his former declarations ; said, that every one knew his mind on the subject of arbitrary ex- ecutions; that he certainly approved the ad which was now proposed, as far as it provided against such offences for the future; but could not concur
in
c H A P. in giving it a retrofpet to any tranfaaion already
X.L- passed.
While Caesar thus, in delivering his own opinion, asseted to go no farther than consistency and a regard to his former conduct seemed to require, he permitted or direced his party to go every length with Clodius, and meant either to ruin Ci- cero, or force him to accept of protection on the terms that should be prescribed to him.
When the general law had passed, there was yet no mention of Cicero; and his enemies might have still found it a difficult matter to carry the appli- cation to him; but he himself, in the anguish of his mind, anticipated the consequence, went forth in mourning to the treets, and implored mercy of every citizen with an aspet of despondency, which probably did not encourage any party to espouse his cause. He was frequently met in this condi- tion, and insulted by Clodius, who walked in the fireets, attended by an armed rabble; and deter- mined at last to abandon the city. Being escorted by a company of his friends, he passed through the gates in the middle of the night on the first of April, took the road of Lucania, and intended to have made his retreat into Sicily, where he flatter- ed himself the memory of his adininiftration in the quality of Quaestor, and the subsequent effects of his patronage at Rome, were likely to procure him a favourable reception '. But Clodius, im- mediately upon his departure, having carried a
special i Vid. Actionem in Verrcm.
special attainder, by which, in the language of c H A P. such ads, he was interdiced the use of fire and a , .. water; and by which every person within five hundred miles of Italy was forbid, under severe penalties, to harbour him; Virgilius, the Prator of Sicily, though his friend, declined to receive him. He turned from thence to Brundisium, pas- fed into Macedonia, and would have fixed his re- fidence at Athens; but apprehending that this place was within the distance prescribed to him by the aft of banishment, he went to" Thefalonica in his way to Cyzicum. Here he had letters, that gave him intimation of some change in his favour, entertained some profpea of being speedily recal- led, and accordingly determined to wait the issue of these hopes.
We have better means of knowing the frailties of Cicero, than perhaps is safe for the reputation of any one labouring under the ordinary defects of human nature. He was open and undisguised to his friends, and has left an extensive correfpon- dence behind him. Expressions of vanity in £ome passages of his life, and of pusillanimity in others, escape him with uncommon facility. Being at leafs of a querulous and impatient temper, he gave it full scope in his exile, perhaps not more from weakness, than from a design to excite his friends in redoubling their cflorts to have him restored. He knew the value of fortitude as a topic of praise, and might have aspired to it; but would it not, he may have queflioned, in the present infiance,

C H A P. encourage his party to sleep over his wrongs ? In i-w. any other view, his complaints resemble more the
wailings of an infant, or the firains of a tragedy composed to draw tears, than the language of a man supporting the cause of integrity in the midst of unmerited trouble. " I wish I may fee the "day," he writes to Atticus, " in which I shall "be disposed to thank you for having prevailed " upon me not to lay violent hands on myself; " for it is certainly now matter of bitter regret to " me that I yielded to you in that matter '."
In answer to the fame friend, who had chid him for want of fortitude, " What species of evil," he fays, " do I not endure ? Did ever any person "' fall from so high a state ? in so good a cause ? " with such abilities and knowledge ? with so much " public esteem ? with the support of such a re- " fpetable order of citizens? Can I remember " what I was, and not feel what I am ? Stript of " so many honours, cut off in the career of so "much glory, deprived of such a fortune, tore " from the arms of such children, debarred the " view of such a brother, dearer to me than I was " to myself, yet now debarred from my presence, ' that I may spare him what he mull susser from " such a fight, and myself what I mufl feel in be- .

From the whole of this correspondence of Ci- c H A P. cero in his exile, wve may collet to what degree Xx the unjust reproaches which he had suffered, the desertion of those on whom he relied for support, the dangers to which he left his family exposed, affected his mind. The consciousness of his in- tegrity, even his vanity forsook him; and his fine genius, no longer displayed in the Forum or in the Senate, or busied in the literary studies which afterwards amused him in a more calamitous time of the republic, now, by exaggerating the distress of his fortunes, preyed upon himself. It appeared from this, and many other scenes of his life, that although he loved virtuous ations, yet his virtue was accompanied with so unfatiable a thirst of the praise to which it entitled him, that his mind was unable to sustain itself without this foreign affirfance; and when the praise to which he aspired for his Consulate was changed into ob- loquy and scorn, he seems to have loft the sense of good or of evil in his own conduct or character; and at Theffalonica, where he fixed the fccne of his exile, funk or rose, even in his own esteem, as he seemed to be valued or neglected at Rome .

A Sermon Preached  in the Ersh Language to  His  Majesty's  First Highland  Regiment of Foot,  Commanded by Lordfohn  Murray, At   their  Cantonment at Camberwell, on the 18th Day  of  December  1745. Being  appointed as  a Solemn Fast.


God,  in dispensing   his  Judgments  and  mercies  to humankind,  no  doubt pays  regard  to  their  different  characters;  and  though  we  are  not  rashly to Judge  of men's  merit  by their  misfortunes  in  particular  instances, yet sacred  history  gives sufficient  authority to presume that public  calamities are the effect  of public corruption,  and that there  is no way of thoroughly averting  the  punishment  but  by  a general  reformation  of  manners.
It  is from  this  consideration  that  at  particular  times,  but  more  especially  in times of general distress, the national authority  is interposed  to admonish every congregation  and society of men  to humble  themselves before  God in a solemn  and open  manner,  that  he may avert  his deserved Judgments from  us and bless our resolutions towards a better conduct  for  the  future.
As our country  is  at present torn with domestic disorder, we can do no less in duty to our God, to our fellow-countrymen,  and to our own souls, than heartily  to  comply with  the  public  appointment,  in  humbling  ourselves before  God,  in  praying  that  he  would  forgive  our  sins,  and  disappoint the  malice  of our  enemies. This  is our  duty  as men  and  Christians,  in common  with  all  the  members  of  the  society  to which  we  belong. As I have had occasion to illustrate this on a former  occasion, I shall at present turn  your  attention  to your  peculiar  duty  as men who  are  in  the  more particular  manner  set  apart  for  the  defense  of your  country;  to  whose hands  the  sword  is entrusted  and whose  business  it  is, not  only by your pious and  regular behavior to draw down the blessing of God  upon  your country and contribute  to its peace and  good order, but more  particularly to repel the assaults of its enemies by the blessing of God on your  fidelity and courage. It  was  with  a  view to this that  I  made choice to these words of Joab,   in which  he addressed  himself to the army  of  Israel  when  they were ready to engage with their enemies. And it is to be hoped  that the  motive he uses to whet their resolution  may have the like effect  upon you. If it be made  to  appear  that your  people  and  the  cities of your  God  are  attacked and endangered  in their most valuable concerns, I doubt not but you will think the occasion  calls upon you to play the men, and exert your  utmost vigor  in their  defense.
In  the first place, shall endeavor  to  make  it appear that  it  is the  duty of  every  man  to  defend  his  country  when  in  danger.  Secondly,  that  the present  circumstances  of our  country  render  it the  indispensible  duty of every man, and yours  in particular, to be active in its defense.
In  the first  place,  by  a man's  country  is meant  that  society  or  united body of men of which he is a member, sharing all the advantages that arise from  such  a union. Not  merely  the  soil  or  spot  on which  he was  born, as  it  is  too  often  understood  by  many. On  this  supposition,  the  love  of one's  country,  which  has  always  been  esteemed  the  most  manly  virtue, might be rejected  as a mere whim or prejudice. No: the name of country bears a meaning  more  sacred  and  interesting.  It was  not  for  the  place of their  nativity  úia.t  Joab   exhorts  the  Israelites   to play the  men;  it  is for  their people  and  for  the  cities of their  God. As if  he  had  said, God  has already with a mighty arm  relieved your fathers  from  oppression, he made  them free  and  established  them  into a well-ordered  society; he entrusted  them as  keepers  of  his  oracles,  the  blessed  effects  of  which  deliverance  and establishment  you  now  feel. Do not the  laws he  gave you  serve to direct the  conduct  of every  individual  and  to  defend  you  from  the  violence  of others? Are you not instructed in the knowledge of the True God and have you  not  his worship  established  in  the  cities?
Take  courage   then,   and play the  Men for  your  People  and for   the  Cities of your God.
Suffer  not  that  people, whom  he has established  in peace and  liberty, to be scattered over the  face of the  earth,  his  laws to  be  canceled  or  his worship  corrupted.  It  is in a state of society alone that  man  can prosper  either  in  his civil or  religious interests.  We  do  not  subject  ourselves  to  government  merely  to  satisfy the  lusts of those who  are fond  of power.  It  is because  society, under  the regulation of  laws  and government,  is the  state for which  providence  has calculated  our  natures. No  sooner  do  we  make  our  entrance  here,  than we  stand  in  need  of assistance  of others; and were  it not continued,  and afterwards  reciprocally given and received through the whole of our lives, our  being  here  was  forlorn  and  comfortless  indeed.  Laws  are  necessary to secure our persons and properties, to protect the weak and restrain  the violent. Kings and judges become necessary to put those laws in execution and to apply their  sanctions when  necessary  for  the good  of  society.
Our religious  interests  too  are  maintained  under  the  influence  of sound  and wholesome  laws; and  the very name  of  it must  soon  perish  and  dwindle away amongst  men  were  it not  for  the union  into  societies. As the assistance of others  is necessary to  supply  us with  the  outward  conveniences of  life,  so it is likewise to instruct our minds and communicate what God has been pleased to reveal concerning himself  Had not particular men  in nations and countries been appointed to preserve the Oracles of God, our fathers  [would have] received the gospel  in  vain and we never should have heard  the  glad tidings of  salvation  through Jesus  Christ.  In  short,  it  is to society and mutual intercourse  that we owe the advancement of sciences, arts,  improvements,  and  everything  that  is conducive  to the welfare  of  a reasonable  being.
If society is a thing so indispensably necessary to human  nature, and if every individual member reaps such inestimable advantages from  their joint  confederacy,  we  can  no  longer  hesitate  in  drawing  our conclusion  that  each member  is bound, both  on  account  of  his  own  and the public welfare, to maintain that league from which he derives so many blessings. Or  shall we say  that  a  man  is  to lie idle and draw  his  nourishment from  that stock to which he contributes  nothing? Must he not contribute to the support  of that establishment  to which  alone he  owes the  security of his own person and property? The contrary conduct  is not only  unjust, but the height of folly and madness: For if he allows that roof which shelters him  to be destroyed, he himself must  suffer.  If any particular  person is  mean  and  dishonest  enough  to desert  the  public  interest  in  times  of danger,  his cunning ought  to  conceal  his sentiments  from  others  lest  his example  might  induce  them  likewise  to  throw  off  the  restraint  of  laws and  good  order  and  deprive  him  of that  security  and  those  privileges  he was unworthy to enjoy.  In  times of peace and  tranquility every man  may sufficiently  contribute  to the support  of the common  interest by keeping within  the sphere of  his  particular  profession;  but more  may be requisite when the public  is in danger. Thus you  are doubly bound  to defend  your country  as  men  who  share  the  influence  of  its  laws,  in  common  with others, and as men who are set apart and maintained  by the public for this very end. But I proceed to show, in the second place.
That the present circumstances of your country render it the indispensible duty of every man, and yours in particular, to exert your utmost vigor in its defense.
To  prove this, no more  will  be necessary than to show that every subject of Britain enjoys all the advantages that arise from  a  well-ordered  state and that this good order of government  is in danger of being subverted  unless we  exert  ourselves  in  its support.  If any  man  is insensible  of the  advantages that we enjoy  as subjects  of Britain  it must be owing to his want of experience  and  his being a stranger  to oppression. Were we, on  the  one hand, to behold the miserable confusion  that attends anarchy, or to groan under  the  insolence  and  pride  of  a  tyrant,  we  might  then  learn  to value our  present  happiness  at  a higher  rate. Were we  to  behold  violence  and rapine in the room ofjustice,  or  [to see] the unrestrained  lusts of a tyrant take the  place of  law  and  equity, we might thence  learn to consider  security  and  liberty  as a treasure  not  too  dearly bought  at the  expense of our blood. This our  fathers  felt,  and  they  have  left  us the  fruits  of their  toils in  our  present  happy  establishment.  Our  laws  secure  our  civil  liberties and  shelter  us  from  injury;  no man, however weak or  despicable,  can be injured without redress, nor can the most powerful  injure, without  being called  to  an account. Our  king, in whose wise  and  mild  government we have all cause to rejoice, can make no  law  without the advice of his people  given by their representatives  in parliament. And indeed the whole nation almost  shows  how well  they  are  satisfied  with  his  government,  by  that alacrity with which  they contribute  support  to the  king and  our  present constitution.  Nor  is  it  to  be  wondered  at:  For  where  are  the  instances of  his  oppression,  or  where  is  he  that  can  tax  him  with  any  encroachment on  his people's  privileges? Are not our  laws duly executed  and  our persons and properties secured, the happy effects  of which administration we behold  in that peace and independence which prevails in every part of our  country?  Nor  are we  less  happy  in  our  religious  establishment.  We have Moses and the prophets, the gospel of Christ, and the writings of his apostles  put  into our  hands with  freedom  to peruse  them;  there  to  learn our duty and with our own  eyes perceive what God requireth of  us.
Our worship  is not  clogged v^th  superstitious  ceremonies  calculated  to strike the  simple with  awe or  raise the  power  of  a  designing men. We have no whimsical doctrines for which there  is no foundation  in scripture. We are not bound  to yield implicit faith  to the dictates of others. Every man  may openly  profess  his  sentiments,  unless  manifestly  subversive  of the  state, without  any  apprehensions  of  the  rack  or  gibbet;  means  of  instruction frequently  used  even  where  Christianity  is  pretended  to.  Care  is  taken that  we  be  instructed  in  religion  in  our  youth  and  the  duties  of  it  afterwards  inculcated  through  the whole  of our  lives. In  that  particular,  that part  of  the  country  from  which  we  come  is  peculiarly  indebted  to  the king and government.  Free schools  have been  erected  for  the  instruction of  the  poor  and  ministers  supported  at the  expense of the crown. Where churches were thinly scattered,  [the king and government  saw to it]  that the  knowledge  of  religion  and  the worship  of God  might  be wanting  in no part  of  the  kingdom." How well some of them  have repaid  this care, let their own consciences answer. Blessed be God, we are not accountable for  the conduct  of others, nor  need we blush while our  own  character as faithful  and honest  [men]  remains entire.
What has now been mentioned  is a short review of privileges you  enjoy under the present government; your persons  and liberty  is secured; your religion  is established  pure and  undefiled  according to the Word of God.
What  change  for  the  better  this  rebellion  would  bring  is not  easily conceived. Do the authors of it propose to give greater security  to  our persons, to better our  laws, or reform  our  religion? Neither  can be expected  from the rapacious tempers of some, nor the avowed principles of  others.
Would they only substitute another  in the room  of the best of kings? This would argue them mad and declared enemies to their country: For what purpose rebel  against  one  whose  clemency  and  equitable  government  they  have experienced,  in  favor  of another,  of whom  nothing farther  is known  but that  he  has  been  bred  in  the  schools  of  tyranny  and  superstition?  The madness  of  such  a procedure  is  open  and  palpable,  or  looks  rather  like the daring attempt of desperate men  to advance their own  fortunes  at the expense  of their  country.  Shall we suppose  that, contrary  to the  declared inclination of this kingdom, they subvert the present government  by  force; where  then  is our  security? Where are our  laws and  privileges? Force has already  taken  place; we  are  already  enslaved  into  compliance with  their demands. And on what grounds can we presume but that they will maintain, by the measures of tyranny and oppression, what they have gained by force? Can we suppose that those who  [have] contemned  laws and justice in  making their acquisition will peaceably yield to these rules when  their success  shall  give  them  more  license  to  transgress?  As we  have  all  the reason in the world to dread the consequences of their  success,  so  we have reason  to  bless God  that  he  has put  the  means  in  his  majesty's  hands  to scourge their  insolence and protect this nation  from  the ruin  they intend it. It  is to be hoped  that  we,  upon  this occasion, will contribute our share towards  those  ends  as we  tender  the   Good of  our  People,   and  the Cities  of our Cod.
The  single  circumstance  of  its being hatched  and  supported  by the declared enemies of our country is sufficient  to obviate the most specious pretences  made  in  favor  of  this  rebellion.  Are  the  French,   against  whom we  have spent our  blood  and  treasure, whom  you  have encountered  like enemies in the  field,  now become our friends? Are they concerned  for our welfare?  Do they propose to rectify what  is amiss in our government  and render us happy at their own expense?  Let who will be ensnared  by such pretences, sure the very mention  of  it  is enough to rouse the  indignation of a reasonable man; and the more so, if it has misled any of those we may have  formerly  deemed  worthy  of our  friendship  and  acquaintance.'''  By what arguments  can they prove that the  French   have no design to extend their  dominion,  their  religion,  and  policy  to  this  island?  Does  any  part of  their  former  conduct  authorize  us  to  form  such judgment?  If  they have no such design,  if they are quite disinterested  in the present cause, there  must  be  some  uncommon  change  in  their  policy;  and  the  usage they now intend  [for]  the rebels  oîBritain,  very different  [from]  that they have shown towards others who relied on them. They too will  feel  in the consequences  that  they  are  only  made  tools  to  serve  the  purposes  very different  from  the ends they propose to themselves.
But  even  let us  suppose  the  French   only  meant  to  seat this  Pretender on  the throne   o{Britain  and  leave him  afterwards  the  free  management of the kingdom: What can we expect in our civil religious concerns  from a popish king but the subversion  of liberty and entire corruption  of our religion? May we not expect to have our bibles snatched from our hands, ourselves  dragged  to  the  stake  and  the  gibbet  for  perusing  the Word  of God? Ignorance and superstition again resume their tyranny in our lands and  we  and  our  posterity  bend  to  the  unnatural  dominion  of  priests and churchmen?  But to quiet  these our  apprehensions, we  are told  our future  mock  prince  has  no  regard  to  religion  at  all.  How  agreeable  a prospect it is to live under the dominion of an atheist, let those who have any  regard  to  religion  or virtue  Judge!
The  very name  of  religion  must be lost under such a government, or that form  established which is most conducive to the ends of  the  prince, not that which  is most  agreeable to the Word of God. And  is there any that bids fairer to enslave  humankind than  popery,  or  any  that  a  designing,  ambitious  prince  would  sooner pitch upon, for that end? But granting he had no personal attachment  to the Church  of  Rome,  yet  he  lies under  the  highest  obligations  to  those who  have; and  the establishment  of it here must  have been  a condition stipulated  in  order  to  engage  them  in  his  interest.  Has  he  not  received his  early  instructions  form  the  zealous  supporters  of  popery,  and  does not  he come  from  these  schools to claim the  sovereign direction  of our affairs  civil  and  religious?  Sure  it  is  natural  to  suppose  that  the  Court of  Rome,  who  consider  us  as their  enemies  and  our  religious  constitution  as  directly  subversive  of  their  authority,  will  take  this  and  every opportunity  to  sap  the  foundation  of  our  religion  and  policy  in  order to  subject  us  again  to  their  dominion.  These  things  are  so  open  and palpable  that  it must  argue very little concern  about  religion to  hesitate in  the  matter. The  mere  mention  of  a  change  in our  government  from France  or  Rome  is enough to create suspicions and rouse the spirits of the most  secure. But  allowing there were  no  such weighty prejudice  in  the case,  yet the very presence that is made to support this Pretender's claim is enough to fill every breast with indignation. We are told, here is a man, notwithstanding  we  are now under the best government, who has a right to command  us, our  persons, and  estates. It  is strange: Are we then,  by birth, the property of a man? May we be bought and  sold  like the beasts of the field? Were  any  man  to  sell  us  so we  should  be  surprised  at  his impudence, yet such  is  the pretence that  is  made to support this rebellion.
Though  the  government  we  are  under  is  the  most Just  and  equitable, though we are all averse to change, yet  we  belong to another  indefeasible  right  of succession  in consequence  of which  he now comes to claim  by force.  Such a claim  is certainly founded  on principles  the most  unheard and  extravagant.  We  must  suppose  that  government  is established  not for  the  good  of humankind  but to  satisfy  the  lusts of  a  Prince; and  that the whole  body of  a  people was made  for  his sake, seeing he  has a right to disturb  their  peace  and  happiness,  in  order  to  impose  his  dominion over them.  Since one  man  may thus become the proprietor  of millions, whose persons and  lives are only destined  to serve his pleasure; by what marks has providence distinguished  this wonderful  man  for whose sake millions of his own species were created? Were we not originally  formed after  the  Image of God,  as well as he? Are we not  reasonable beings and accountable  for  our  conduct?  We  are  accountable  for  the  changes  we make  in our  laws and  religion,  and  if we corrupt  that  religion  God  has given  us we must  answer  it  at the  great  Day. From what  right  then  has he a title to impose a change on us, for which we alone are accountable?
Blessed  be  God,  there  is nothing  either  in  Scripture  or  Nature  to  give countenance  to  such  a claim.  We  have voluntarily  submitted  ourselves to  a lawful  government;  we  have the Word  of God  known  amongst  us and  his  worship  established  according  to  it.  And  none  has  a  right  to withdraw our alliance from  our king or  force us to admit any corruption into our worship.
Thus  I hope  it  sufficiently  appears  that we  have  great  reason  now  to bestir  ourselves  in  defense  of  our  country.  Our  personal  security,  our religion,  laws,  and  everything  that  can  be  dear  to  a  reasonable  man  is called  into question. The  Disturbers  of  its  peace are now  advanced  into the very heart of the Kingdom and would direct their course towards the metropolis  which  you, with  others,  are  appointed  to  defend;  and  I  am persuaded  [that] when you  have occasion to act you will not be wanting to  your  religion,  your  kind,  your  country,  and  yourselves;  which  will effectually  wipe  away  any  reproach  that  may  be  thrown  upon  you  on their  account.
Remember,  you  are  men  sworn  to defend  your  country:
Take  courage, and play  the  Men for   your People  and for   the  Cities of your God.
If you  oppose your acquaintances it is to prevent their ruin: If you oppose your relations it is to save them and their posterity from  slavery  forever.
Let  us now humble  ourselves before  God; pray that  he would  forgive our  sins;  that  he  would  continue  the  Light  of  his  Gospel  amongst  us;
and strengthen our Hands in the Defence  of our holy religion and happy privileges.
