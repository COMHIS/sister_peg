fully satisfy me, and on which it solely depends whether I shall immediately mention this interesting subject to your sister, or be silent on it for ever. I have remarked, since her abode here, that your sister has had a very zealous admirer, who cannot have failed I imagine in pro-fiting from the many opportunities he has enjoyed of soliciting her favor.
               Of Captain Wilmot, cried I, you need have no apprehensions. I hope you do Fanny the justice to believe that the assi-duities of such a rival are by no means formidable.
               He possesses at least youth and good looks in his favour, replied Mr. How-ard; but you relieve my mind from a weight of painful anxiety, as this is a bar which must not only have proved wholly insurmountable, but one of those to ob-viate which I could not even have at-tempted; for though I shall not expect the heart of my mistress, I must possess a

sister's name for the interest he has taken in her concerns. I think I can do no less. An obligation may wound a proud spirit, but the testimonial of a proper gratitude cannot hurt an ingenuous one.
                  There is one circumstance, material and interesting, in Mrs. Hindon's letter, on which I have not yet touched, but which I conjecture will not pass unnoticed even by you, and as for me, it has em-ployed my thoughts day and night ever since it reached me: Roatsley, she tells me, appears to have been kept hitherto in utter ignorance with regard to our un-lucky transactions with his mother, and to be wholly unacquainted with the rejected application to our grandfather. Though how particulars of such importance in the family should have been concealed from his knowledge it is impossible to conjec-ture. There is indeed a mystery in this affair which Mr. Howard, Fanny, and myself, attempt in vain to unravel. Is

it too fanciful to imagine that Lady Lin-rose, fearing the known generosity of her amiable son's disposition might lead him to act against the wishes of Lord Bel-mont, may have determined on keeping him wholly in ignorance. I am bewil-dered in a variety of imaginary opinions, and not a little secretly delighted at find-ing myself enabled to exculpate him from those charges of pride and duplicity, which in spite of a too insinuating parti-ality, have sometimes painfully recurred to my mind.
                  Can it be, my Sophia! that Roatsley has been so long ignorant, and what is equally astonishing and unaccountable, has been informed from the lips of Mrs. Hindon only, that we are so nearly allied by the ties of blood? Yet what are these ties? how weak, how insufficient alone either to produce friendship or to excite esteem or admiration! The connection is indeed productive of satisfaction,

merely from the idea that it is a founda-tion for intercourse and a pretext for in-timacy. I think however, even in com-mon politeness, he ought to have ap-peared less dejected than he did upon the discovery. His silence and embarrass-ment during our last interview evidently confess what little satisfaction he derived from the information.
                  I have been reading Mrs. Hindon's letter once more; and tho' shock'd at the indelicacy too visibly expressed in almost every line, now that I am cool there are some passages in it which do not wholly displease me. How feeling, how consi-derate, how noble, has been Roatsley's conduct. His heart is indeed open to every call of distress, and to every senti-ment of compassion. How amiable is his delicacy compared to that of his part-ner in the generous transaction. It pains me not, nay I should be gratified, to re-ceive an obligation from my cousin, dis-tinct

from the sordid and humiliating consideration of money matters. The anxiety and trouble therefore which were exerted on this occasion, dilate my heart and animate my gratitude. I am alone hurt that the representations of my offi-cious agent were dictated with so little judgment as to excite his pity, and so little refinement as to mortify my feel-ings. To this was owing the distressing and unsuccessful attempt to wound me still more severely by pecuniary favours.
                  I have received a letter from Miss Par-sons, who promised at parting some-times to let me hear from her. She tells us that she is now most agreeably settled in that line, for which she regarded her-self as best qualified to earn her own in-dependent subsistence, and that she is to quit Mrs. Hindon's in a few days, who has been much displeased with the ingra-titude of her conduct towards so kind a

relation: these are the good lady's own words.
                  The lady with whom she was in terms, held her determination suspended as I told you, on account of some point on which Miss Parsons did not answer her wishes; but on that deserving young woman's offering her services in person, she was so much pleased with her ap-pearance, as to wave all deficiencies, and closed immediately with her terms. Pray who do you imagine this lady has turned out to be? no other than Lady Linrose herself: and Miss Parsons at this moment actually makes one of her family.

               LETTER XV. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     APRIL 2.
                  
               
               I Have been ill and unfit for writing for some days past; and tho' still feeble and dejected, I hasten to that soothing relief which pouring our anxieties into the bo-som of friendship ever bestows, even in the most ditressful situations.
               Mr. Howard, rambling over his grounds the other evening as it began to grow dusk, perceived on the high road at the foot of the hill, a carriage and four driving with great vehemence, as if desir-ous of arriving at the end of its journey before night should render travelling, in

the present state of the weather, dange-rous as well as uncomfortable. A period however was but too soon put to their career, by a most alarming accident: the axle-tree all at once gave way, and the coach was suddenly overset with a vio-lence which made Mr. Howard, who was at no great distance, tremble for the lives of the unfortunate travellers.
               He flew instantly to their assistance; and found they consisted of a lady and her maid, attended by two footmen on horseback, who were endeavouring to pull the unlucky Abigail out of the shat-tered equipage. This, with the aid of Mr. Howard, was, tho' with difficulty, effected: but they soon perceived that the situation of the girl was infinitely less deplorable than the condition in which they beheld the poor lady, who lay with-out motion at the bottom of the coach, her head and arm cut severely by the

glasses, her face covered with blood, and apparently dead.
               Having lifted her out of the coach, Mr. Howard, assisted by the maid, who forgot her own sufferings in her terror for her lady, wiped the blood from her face, endeavoured to stop its effusions with her handkerchief, plentifully be-sprinkled her with water, which a late fall of snow abundantly supplied on all sides; and having administered the aid of eau de luce, sal volatile, &amp;c. the poor lady, to their unspeakable joy, at length opened her eyes.
               As soon as she was sufficiently reco-vered, Mr. Howard informed her that his house was not above a quarter of a mile from the spot, and that every assistance could there be speedily procured to alle-viate her own sufferings and those of her maid; and besought her to allow him to help her into his own little carriage, for which he had dispatched one of the foot-men

at the moment of his coming up, and which was now arrived. This con-veyance was by no means suited to the present exigency, being a one horse chair, the only equipage this family boasts of. In this, assisted by the attendants, Mr. Howard placed the unfortunate la-dy, and slowly approached the house.
               I have brought you an unexpected guest, my dear, cried Mr. Howard, as he entered, supporting the feeble unfor-tunate; but would to heaven we had been introduced to the honour of her ac-quaintance in circumstances less unhappy, for she has met with a most alarming ac-cident and is severely hurt.
               Fanny received her with that cordial kindness to which her situation so justly laid claim. The surgeon, who had been sent for from the village adjoining, on examining her bruises declared that one of her arms was dislocated, and that there was a fracture of one of the small bones

near the wrist. The unfortunate lady immediately underwent the necessary ope-rations; but the groans which her agony excited rendered us incapable of remain-ing near her.
               At length however her acute sufferings were over. The operator departed, having enjoined the strictest attention to quiet and rest, and my sister and I were again admitted into her apartment to see every thing prepared by Therese, her own maid being unable to attend her. We then returned to the parlour, not a little eager to be made acquainted with the name of our lovely guest, a point in which we still remained ignorant.
               Mr. Howard instantly gratified our curiosity; having learnt from the servants that their lady was the Countess of Au-brey, and that they were on their way to her country residence in the next county, when this unfortunate accident put a pe-riod for the present to their journey. He

certain degree of her attachment; a wish to please, and a willingness to be pleased, on which to build my hopes of gaining the affections of my wife: without this I should be myself miserable, nor would it be in my power to render her happy.
               If she cannot compleatly bestow her heart, my dear Sir, cried I, may she like-wise withhold her hand. But I am cer-tain my sister is too sensible of the value of your's, to trifle with a proposal so ge-nerous and disinterested. Ifâ€”for our af-fections are not always in our own power, and the caprice of taste is but too often at variance with reason and judgmentâ€”if she cannot make a proper return, I am certain you have too much delicacy to wish her your's and too much good sense to be offended.
               Offended! Miss Seymour: be assured I never shall be offended; and believe me, hardly surprised.
               As Mr. Howard pronounced these

informed us likewise that he had sent an express to Sir William Meredith, (whose lady was Lady Aubrey's nearest relation, and tenderly attached to her, and who would be miserable, the girl said, if ab-sent from her lady at a juncture so cri-tical), acquainting him with this unfor-tunate event, and requesting that he and Lady Meredith would take up their re-sidence at Hubert Hill till all alarm re-specting Lady Aubrey was at an end.
               This accident you may suppose, by inte-resting our compassion so powerfully, had discomposed us not a little, and wholly interrupted the social tranquillity in which our evenings are usually spent.
               Mr. Howard in particular was uncom-monly grave, and testified an anxiety, which, had not the singular humanity of his disposition been well known to me, might have created suspicion. I am very apprehensive, said he, for the life of La-dy Aubrey. Her delicacy of frame

seems but ill calculated for sustaining an accident of this kind, and too much cau-tion cannot be pursued.
               The consequence too powerfully justi-fied his alarm: about three in the morn-ing I was suddenly awakened by Therese, who hastily drew aside my curtain. Ah! Mademoiselle! said she, la pauvre dame est tres mal.
               She then informed me that her Lady-ship had been excessively unquiet all the night, and so low spirited, that appa-rently worn out by restlesness and pain, she at length burst into tears; and telling Therese she could not rest, ordered her to bring a light into her chamber as she found sleeping impossible.
               The girl entreated her to swallow a few drops in some water, to which she con-sented; and giving over all thoughts of repose, she had her curtains drawn aside, and tried to beguile the tedious hours of midnight by entering into conversation

with Therese; who possesses all the lo-quacity of her nation, and who, from en-countering few of her equals to whom she can talk, seizes with avidity every opportunity she can lay hold of to in-demnify herself for the painful penance of silence, by making reprisals upon those who understand her language.
               Her Ladyship, she said, had made ma-ny enquiries about my sister and me, to whose humanity and hospitality she often repeated she owed her life; and the girl was in hopes she found herself somewhat easier, when she was seized all at once with a fit so violent and alarming, that Therese was obliged to call up her own maid to her assistance; and tho' she is now rather more composed, continued she, I am afraid Madame's fever is ex-tremely high. She talks very incohe-rently, mutters to herself in a manner truely frightful, and just now insists on rising and being dressed.
               
                  
This information made me hastily get up; and unwilling to disturb my sister, who of late has been rather indisposed, I threw my wrapping gown over me, and ordering Mr. Rudder, the surgeon, to be instantly sent for, I stole softly into Lady Aubrey's apartment, and approaching the bed, where her maid was unwillingly assisting her to rise, I enquired how she found herself; but oh! Sophia! how shall I find words by which to convey to you an idea of the sensations which over-powered me? Is it in language to fur-nish expressions adequate to those feelings which overwhelmed my senses, when the amiable, the unfortunate Lady Aubrey, with a frantic violence that eluded all op-position, suddenly springing from the bed, threw herself at my feet, and em-bracing my knees, exclaimed in accents which froze my bloodâ€”oh! my Lord! my beloved Lord Linrose! for the sake of heaven do not frown upon me so ter-ribly.

Your looks stab me to the soul! you terrify me my Lord!â€”oh! have mercy upon me!â€”I was dear to you once!â€”did you not say so?â€”and I have long, long forgiven you all you have made me endure.
               I heard no more, but fell senseless on the ground.
               Therese and the woman, terrified at the unaccountable scene before them, flew to our assistance; and while the one ineffectually administered hartshorn and other volatile restoratives to me, the other entreated her distracted lady to suffer herself to be again undrest and to return to bed: and so quickly does insanity change the object of its interest and pur-suit, that forgetting the idea which had but a moment before so violently agita-ted her bosom, she allowed herself to be again put to bed, and yielding to weak-ness, was for some time tolerably still and composed.
               
                  
Finding in the mean while that I shewed no symptoms of recovery, The-rese in terror awakened my sister, who flew half dressed into the room just as I had opened my eyes and began to recol-lect my situation.
               A seasonable flood of tears in some measure relieved the anguish of my feel-ings, and allayed Fanny's apprehensions of a relapse; and with her assistance, I summoned strength sufficient to quit Lady Aubrey's chamber, where the sound of her voice repeating in the most me-lancholy accents my father's name, and breathing her soft and heart breaking complaints at his cruelty and detestation, threw me into agonies unspeakable.
               Fanny, who was yet unacquainted with the cause of my agitation, and who hav-ing been merely informed that Lady Aubrey was delirious, in her anxiety on my account had not attended to the in-coherencies that fell from her lips, ea-gerly

poured upon me, the moment we left it, a thousand enquiries respecting the occasion of the fit with which I had been seized. I was unable to satisfy her; and felt relieved by the entrance of Mr. Howard, whose countenance informed me that to him at least the task of dis-closing it was unnecessary.
               For heavens sake, my dearest sister, compose yourself, cried Mr. Howard. The pain of this affecting incident I might have prevented, had I dreaded or foreseen an explanation so distressing and abrupt: but the apprehension of inflict-ing an unnecessary wound deterred me from an information which I was well qualified to have given the instant Lady Aubrey's name reached my ears.
               What information? cried Fanny. You frighten me, tho' without knowing why. I perceive this lady is one of our rela-tions: but why should the knowledge of that circumstance wound or distress us.
               
                  
If you will promise me, my dear, not to be too much affectedâ€”
               For heavens sake tell me to what all this preparation tends?
               I am just going to do so, said he, tak-ing her hand; and I hope you will not be alarmed when I desire you to recall to mind an unfortunate lady, whose name frequently occurs in the packet once en-trusted to my careâ€”Miss Marsdon.
               Good God! is it possible! Can Lady Aubrey be in fact that miserable, that ill fated woman: and subdued by a crowd of melancholy ideas, Fanny melted into tears; but frightened to witness the still superior anguish of my feelings, she for-got her own distress to soothe mine.
               Oh! my dearest Hermione! cried she, do not give way to this agitation. You will distract me. Consider, my love, that time must have long since greatly allayed Lady Aubrey's sufferings. Those of our dear, dear father, are hap-pily

lulled to perpetual rest. He is now disengaged from all the pains and sorrows of the world, and this accidental rencon-tre ought not too severely to affect us.
               The apprehension of alarming her made me exert myself to assume a com-posure to which I could not so speedily attain; but revolving in my mind all the circumstances that had occurred since Lady Aubrey's arrival, it was not diffi-cult for me to trace the cause of the me-lancholy delirium with which she had been seized, nor of that sudden burst of grief that so wholly overpowered her the instant I was presented to her sight; and which, tho' it seemed to us the natural consequence of depression and uneasiness, had undoubtedly its source in my re-semblance to my father, which has been ever deemed strikingly remarkable, and which must have overwhelmed her, even at the first moment, with some slight sus-picion of my being in fact one of those

daughters of whose existence I can hardly imagine she has remained wholly igno-rant; and her conversation with the lo-quacious Therese, a conversation possibly designed to ascertain her doubts, pouring undeniable conviction on her mind at a moment of fatigue, pain, and indisposi-tion, no wonder that such a conflict of emotions co-operating with her late acci-dent, should have disordered her imagi-nation.
               Upon interrogating Therese more mi-nutely, I find these conjectures strongly corroborated. Tho' sighs and tears, she says, often burst from the unfortunate invalid, her expressions were distinct, and to all appearance her reason clear, till after midnight; when calling Therese to the side of her bed, she enquired into a thousand particulars relating to her two ladies. Were they lately arrived from abroad? in what part of the continent did they usually reside? did they give

words, Fanny opened the door of the dressing room and looked in. The la-dies, cried she, are much astonished at your long absence; and Mrs. Hindon is so entertained with your tete a tete, that she is absolutely become witty on the oc-casion. I wish you would therefore ap-pear in your own defence, for I am quite fatigued in finding excuses for you.
               This she said with an air of gaiety that was instantly checked on perceiving the embarrassment her sudden appearance at this juncture occasioned. Mr. Howard seemed rather at a loss, and on his account I could not avoid feeling conscious. Fan-ny finding I answered her with some de-gree of awkwardness, looked first to the one, then to the other, as if with a design of penetrating into the cause of our being so evidently disconcerted; and observing the raillery in the drawing room accord so well with the confused situation into which her appearance had thrown us,

into the gaieties of Mâ€”, (within sixty miles of which place Therese had told her we lived,) or did we prefer the re-tirement of the country? on all of which Therese was sufficiently communicative.
               Late in the evening Lady Meredith ar-rived. All this day Lady Aubrey con-tinued in the most dangerous way. Her fever seemed rather on the encrease, tho' already so violent that she had not had one interval of returning recollection, but raved with unceasing and dreadful incoherency since the moment of my sud-den appearance.
               During this time you may easily judge what were my sensations. The weight on my spirits was indeed insupportable. Regarding Lady Aubrey in the light of a woman for whom my beloved parent had suffered so muchâ€”the woman who loved and had endured so much for himâ€”my heart became attached to her by a strong and irresistible impulse of affection, and

I could not but feel deeply interested in a life which was once so dear to him. Anxiety, and a respect almost filial, ur-ged me to watch with eager sedulity the turn of her fever, and to administer with my own hands the prescriptions ordered by the physicians who were called in to her assistance: but wholly overcome by the incoherent ravings of her delirium, no sooner was I seated by her bed side than my feelings rendered me incapable of remaining in silence and composure, and I was obliged to fly to another apart-ment for the relief of weeping aloud and at liberty.
               My sister and Mr. Howard intreated me to spare myself the anguish of a scene so dreadful; but when it became insup-portable, I made my escape, and while I preserved fortitude sufficient for the task, I felt a secret idea of duty which recompenced me for the pain of my at-tendance.
               
                  
Sir William Meredith was prevented from accompanying his lady by a fit of the gout. Her terrors on account of her niece were indeed extreme. She wept violently on alighting, and possessed hardly resolution sufficient for listening to the particulars of her accident.
               The countenance of the physician feel-ingly told how much was to be dreaded, All I can in conscience tell you, Madam, said Doctor Harding to Lady Meredith, is, that you will not remain long in the misery of suspense. One way or other it must soon be decided.
               This day, alas! has produced no symptom in the least favorable. Lady Aubrey continues to endure all the rest-less turbulence of delirium, is in conti-nual motion, shifts an uneasy posture perpetually without finding one that be-stows more relief, and is sometimes obliged to be detained by force from leaving her bed. She talks incessantly; and tho' her

discourse is incoherent, it is uniformly pa-thetic, melancholy, and interesting. She not only recurs often to my father's name, but if I mistake not, even Mr. Benseley's some hours ago escaped her. The friendly part he acted in those dismal scenes which lie so heavy on her disordered mind, ren-ders this a natural transition of ideas.
               
                  
                     
                        APRIL 12.
                     
                  
                  After a tedious suspense of ten days, Lady Aubrey's fever, thank Heaven, be-gins to give way to medicine. Doctor Harding this day pronounces his patient in a fair way of recovery. Her recollec-tion is perfectly restored, the violence of her fever is abated, and she is now sensi-ble of her aunt's attendance, who leaves not her chamber either day or night, having a small field bed placed in the room, wherein she has taken what little

repose the perturbation and anxiety of her spirits allowed.
                  This interval has been a period of real anguish to me. All the horrors of my father's sufferings and misfortunes, this wonderful and unexpected incident has renewed in my mind with augmented poignancy; and that gloomy impression which the soothing hand of time, the ha-bit of frequent reflexion, and the consider-ation of his transition, I trust, to a hap-pier world, had in some measure effaced, this accidental meeting has restored with redoubled violence, attended if possi-ble with encreased depression.
                  Mr. Howard and Fanny having insist-ed on my relinquishing an attendance which the presence of Lady Meredith rendered unnecessary, and which, igno-rant of the secret and singular the that binds my heart to that of the unfortunate Lady Aubrey might be deemed officious by her aunt, I have strictly forborn ever

since her arrival to enter the apartment; and so powerfully has my sensibility strengthened by this forbearance, that had my assistance been required I scarce think I could have summoned resolution sufficient for encountering the hazard of again hearing my father's name pro-nounced in the heart rending accents of the mournful invalid. Even now, that her reason and recollection, through the mercy of Heaven, are restored, I look forward with inexpressible apprehension to the idea of once more meeting her eyes. The pang this interview must occasion to her bosom, the pain with which it must overwhelm mine even in anticipation, agitates me beyond expression.
               
               
                  
                     
                        APRIL 17.
                     
                  
                  Lady Aubrey is much better. She now merely retains that languor and de-pression

which indisposition, independent of dejection, invariably leaves behind as a memento of its power.
                  Lady Meredith, who is a most amia-ble and agreeable woman, now happily delivered from the painful anxiety that oppressed her, gives us at times, when she can be spared from her attendance on her niece, a good deal of her com-pany, and expresses in the warmest terms her gratitude for our attention to Lady Aubrey.
               
               
                  
                     
                        APRIL 20.
                     
                  
                  As yet Lady Aubrey, who is now able to sit up, or rather to recline on the so-pha for some hours every day, has ex-pressed no desire for an interview with either my sister or myself, and the longer this meeting is delayed the more for-midable it appears. It is but too pro-bable,

indeed, that she views it with equal apprehension, and willingly lays hold of the pretence of indisposition to defer a conference which must be pro-ductive of so much pain and embarrass-ment to all parties.
                  I think it not unlikely, that perceiving the obscurity that is thrown over our si-tuation, the borrowed name we have as-sumed, the retirement in which we live, and the total alienation which has taken place between us and my uncle's family, she may be led to conclude our real rank in life a secret even to ourselves, or at least may be induced to suspect that the circumstances of our birth are but partially known to us; those particulars especially in which she herself is imme-diately concerned, she may naturally conjecture the least liable of any to have reached our ears. In this case, as all explanation upon our meeting is out of the question, part of the awkwardness of

the scene will be avoided, and I am la-bouring to think of it with a composure that shall enable me, when it takes place, to behave with the calm indifference of an unconcerned person.

                  Last night Lady Meredith delivered to us a message from Lady Aubrey, in-timating that her Ladyship had been for some days past beyond measure anxi-ous to return us personally her grateful acknowledgments for that benevolent hospitality to which she had been so infinitely indebted; but that the weak state of her nerves rendering her liable to be seized with agitation, and discom-posed by the most trifling occurrences, Lady Meredith had persuaded her into compliance with the injunctions of her physicians, which were on no account

to hazard any risk of being disordered or disturbed in her present feeble condition; finding herself now, however, much re-cruited both in strength and spirits, she hoped in a day or two to be well enough to ask the favour of a visit from us in her dressing room, and in the mean while recommended herself, with many kind and polite expressions, to our good wishes.

                  This formidable interview is at last over. Oh! Sophia! I did not imagine it more formidable than it proved.
                  This morning Lady Meredith came down to the parlour, for she seldom gra-tifies us with her company till dinner, and requested, in Lady Aubrey's name, the favour of my sister's company and mine above stairs. My heart beat vio-lently

she gave way to an expressive smile, and regarding me with an air that sufficiently explained her suspicions, hastily shut the dressing-room door, and departed as if determined not to interrupt us.
               At this little manoeuvre, which plainly discovered her false conclusions on sur-prizing us, I could not refrain from laughing; and even Mr. Howard was not able to resist half smiling at her mis-take. We then separated; but I was forced to support the whole weight of Mrs. Hindon's ridicule on being so long tete a tete with her brother. Her wit, however deficient in other respects, claims the merit of being voluble and keen in the extreme; but happily the entrance of more company soon relieved me.
               Fanny's countenance during the whole evening exhibited a picture of sly mean-ing and significance, which it was ex-tremely amusing to behold. Every fea-ture seemed filled with the importance of

at this message. I felt myself change colour; and involuntarily sat down on the first chair so evidently dis-composed, that Lady Meredith concluded I was ill, and said with much kindness, 'tis fortunate, my dear Miss Seymour, that I would not be prevailed with to accept of your most obliging offer of sharing my fatigue and attendance upon my niece, for I should have undoubtedly suspected that you had suffered for your humanity. I am certain you are indis-posed. Pray allow me to feel your pulse; for you must know I am reckoned an able physician by the poor people around our seat in the country. You are feverish I am convinced, and must nurse yourself for a day or two.
                  I assured her I was perfectly well; but she would not give immediate credit to my assertion, and entreated my sister to prevail with me to allow of the physician's attendance. Finding however that we

both made light of the proposal, she left us to prepare her niece for our appear-ance, who was so feeble and exhausted, that a trifle she said discomposed her spirits, and threw her into a tremor.
                  Alas! Sophia, this interview, though a circumstance of no moment in the eyes of Lady Meredith, was by no means a trifle to the unfortunate Lady Aubrey; and so wholly did the prospect of it over-power her feelings, that her aunt re-turned to us in a few minutes with an apology and request that we would be so kind as to defer our visit till the even-ing, as she found herself languid and oppressed, and meant to lie down for an hour or two.
                  I felt relieved by this short respite; and in the mean while endeavoured to prepare myself for the approaching pe-riod with a composure that might wholly confute any suspicions she might enter-tain of my being conscious of the inte-resting

and melancholy events that form a connexion so singular between us. As for my sister, her emotions, naturally less uncontroulable, at least after the first moments of agitation, I was under no apprehension that she would betray herself; and by preserving if possible an air of serenity myself, I hoped to render this meeting less affecting to Lady Au-brey, who by that means would be spared the painful reflections which our mutual perturbation might otherwise occasion.
                  In the evening, Lady Meredith re-turned again into the parlour. I am come once more, said she, to ask the favour of your company in Lady Au-brey's dressing room. She is by no means well to-day; and I am so apprehensive of a relapse, that I would have persuaded her to defer your visit till to-morrow, and go to rest early; but her heart is so bent upon the pleasure of seeing you, that I fear opposition would prove more

hurtful than the flutter of spirits which the sight of a new face in the present weak state of her nerves may occasion. I however shall remain below, and enjoy a tete a tete with Mr. Howard, that we may not prove too many at once for her.
                  We accordingly went up stairs. The dressing room windows had been dark-ened with blinds, under pretence that the light was offensive, but doubtless with the intention of concealing an emo-tion for which the inadequate allegation of debilitude and recent indisposition only could be given. Lovely even in sickness, she reclined on a sopha; from which, the moment we appeared, she made a feeble attempt to rise; but find-ing herself incapable of effecting it, she fell back in evident discomposure, and holding out a hand to each, burst into tears.
                  All my resolution forsook me at that moment. Beholding her the victim of

those calamities which had wholly embit-tered the declining days of my fatherâ€” calamities which she still lived to de-plore, and evidently felt at that instant with all the agony of recent and bitter disappointment, my heart melted with sympathetic sorrow, and forgetting the composure I had laboured to obtain, I pressed her offered hand to my lips with an enthusiastic fervour which told as plainly as words could have done that I partook in the griefs that oppressed her disconsolate bosom. This language was indeed too expressive not to be instantly comprehended, for raising herself by a sudden effort, she clasped me in her arms, and supporting her head on my shoulder, sobbed aloud..
                  Terrified at the violence of her emo-tions, I would have broke from her to have called Lady Meredith; but redou-bling her caresses, do not leave me, cried she the moment she could articulateâ€”

tears are habitual to me, and those I shed at this moment are produced by sensations which have not often, alas! found entrance into my heart. Let not this agitation frighten you, added she. It's vehemence will in time abate. The Almighty, I trust, sends you to me for my consolation and support. She was unable to proceed; but disengaging her-self from my embraces, she stretched out her arms to Fanny, who flew into them drowned in tears.
                  For heavens sake, dearest Madam, cried she, for I was unable to speak, endeavour to compose yourself; for your own sake and for ours try to be calm. Many, many days of happiness are yet I hope in store for us all. Your friend-ship and affection is alone able to consti-tute our felicity; and it will be the de-light of our lives if you will honour us so far as to flatter us with the hopes of being enabled, from the solicitude of the

tenderest regard and most filial affection, in some slight degree to contribute to your's.
                  Alarmed for the consequences of this scene, and afraid lest the frankness of Fanny's disposition should lead her in the height of her emotions to touch on par-ticulars much too delicate for the present moment, I ran to the door to call Lady Meredith, whose presence I imagined would put a period to a conversation that was about to become much too interesting to all parties, and which in the precarious state of Lady Aubrey's health might prove exceedingly hurtful to a frame so infinitely delicate; but perceiving my intention, she entreated me to sit down by her, and having swal-lowed some drops in water, she became somewhat more composed.
                  I trust in heaven, said she, again tak-ing my hand and obliging Fanny to seat herself upon the sopha, that there are

days of returning peace yet in store for me, since the Almighty has been pleased in his gracious providence to vouchsafe me, by means so unexpected and extra-ordinary, the gratification of that eager wish, in which has been centered all my hopes and expectations of satisfaction on this side the grave; for know, my ami-able young friends, continued she in ac-cents interrupted by tears, that you have been ever sinceâ€”(her voice failed her,) ever since my return to England, the subject of my thoughtsâ€”of my very dreamsâ€”and the unceasing source of my anxious but ineffectual pursuit. Poor Mr. Benseley! He was the firm and un-alterable friend of both. His steady and inflexible attachment no circumstances could change, no reverses could shake, while he remained convinced, continued she clasping her hands together with an energy the most affecting, that there still lay concealed within the secret recess of

the heart, a hidden and obscured, yet fervent sentiment of virtue, which called for the soothing hand of friendship to guard it from distraction and despair.
                  You will not wonder, Sophia, that the conclusion of this speech, by over-whelming me with the complicated sen-sations of astonishment, admiration, sor-row, and delight, should wholly over-power my feelings. Utterance was de-nied me: yet words, had I been able to command them, could have but feebly expressed the tumult of contending emo-tions that agitated my bosom. Throw-ing myself on my knees before the in-jured Lady Aubrey, I dissolved into tears; and while I kissed her hand and pressed it to my heart, my looks and my distress told her how much I venerated and admired her. Oh, Sophia! had you beheld the lovely unfortunate at that moment, you must have adored her.
                  
                     
She embraced me with the tenderest emotion; and I then reiterated my in-treaties that she would allow us to leave her. But while she detained me feebly by the hand, she requested Fanny to re-move the blinds, which now almost wholly obscured the declining rays of the evening, and fixing her eyes stea-dily for an instant on my face, tears again began to flow, and sighing with an expression the most mournful, she bade us good night. You may conclude that my sister and I could not speedily recover the appearance of composure. Yet af-fecting as this interview had proved, a mixture of somewhat soothing and con-solatory has insinuated itself amidst the bitterness of more poignant sensations. By a wonderful interposition of Provi-dence, we had been introduced to the knowledge of one of the most amiable of her sex, who not only felt inclined to accord us her friendship and affection,

a newly-discovered secret: but in so large a party all explanation was impossible; and indeed had she ever found an op-portunity for importuning me on the subject, I had determined in my own mind to leave her under the influence of an unjust surmise rather than anticipate Mr. Howard's declaration.
               One of the company happening to mention with great encomiums an Italian performer who is expected in this coun-try in the course of a month, all the la-dies were expressing their eager expecta-tions of then seeing him. I fancy Her-mione, whispered Fanny, we shall be mighty snug at Hubert Hill, (Mr. How-ard's country seat,) by that time.
               Perhaps we may, returned I with a gay air, which confirming her suspicions ap-peared to give her much delight.
               Mr. Howard at that instant joining us, she seemed ready to laugh in his face out of gayetÃª du coeur. Oh! cried she, still

but who was already our friend, who re-turned with fervor the warm attachment our hearts had imbibed almost the first moment that she was presented to our view, and the bitter recollection of whose past calamities our assiduous attention might prove the fortunate means of soothing into tranquillity. These reflec-tions were of the most pleasing nature, and grateful to our hearts; yet were they but ill calculated for wiping the tears from our eyes: on the contrary, by melting every sensation into tenderness we were almost exhausted with weeping, when Mr. Howard came to seek us in my dressing room, where we had taken refuge in hopes of acquiring that com-posure which our tete a tete had ba-nished still further than ever from our minds.
                  He kissed a hand of each, and telling us that supper waited, and that Lady Meredith was already in the parlour, we

tried to assumed smiling faces, and defer-ring any account of our affecting inter-view till a more convenient opportunity, accompanied him down stairs.
                  On our entrance, and during supper, Lady Meredith's countenance betrayed an expression of grave reserve so different from the frank and open familiarity of manner which since the relief of her anxiety had seemed the characteristic of her mind, that I instantly perceived she had been but recently informed of par-ticulars, which probably the agitation of Lady Aubrey's spirits had discovered to her only an hour or two before. Painful as it was both to witness this change and to suspect the cause, I made large allow-ances for the prejudice which induced her to regard us with repugnance. That Lady Meredith should behold with dis-gust, the offspring of him whose name in all probability she merely knew as the source of misery to her beloved niece,

and with whose subsequent agonies of re-morse she may be wholly ignorant, is not surprising, when such considerations have had power to outweigh in the scale of paternal affection every motive of huma-nity, compassion, and even duty. Yes, Sophia, even duty: for rigid as Lord Belmont's sense of integrity is reported to be, in regard to us, a mistaken notion of honour sways his conduct. It is for minds like the angelic Lady Aubrey's only to prove superior to such sentiments, to wave personal injuries, to discard pri-vate resentment, and to forget her own feelings and sufferings in her pity and affection for the penitent author of her calamities.
                  As Mr. Howard during supper had conversed on indifferent subjects, and Lady Meredith with an air of unusual ceremony seemed determined to follow his lead, the mortifying coldness of her manner deterred me from finding cou-rage

to ask how Lady Aubrey found her-self, and indeed I dreaded trusting my voice with the enquiry. However when the servants had retired, Mr. Howard saved me the trouble.
                  My niece tells me she is no worse, an-swered she coldly; but she is extremely low spirited; and the slightest agitation in her present weak condition may be fatal to a frame so exhausted as her's. I own I am under great uneasiness about her: the apprehension of a relapse terri-fies me.
                  A relapse! cried I in a tone which betrayed my emotion, heaven forbid! or we shall never forgive ourselves; and leaning my head upon my hand, I found myself unable longer to preserve the ap-pearance of the tranquillity I had endea-voured to assume.
                  Mr. Howard made me swallow a se-cond glass of Madeira; and Lady Mere-dith seemed so affected with my tears,

that pressing my hand with even more than her accustomed kindness, all cold-ness, prejudice, and reserve, seemed in-stantly to give way to the kindest sym-pathy and most soothing compassion. Compose yourself, my dear Miss Sey-mour, cried she; my apprehensions have been always accused of greatly magnify-ing every impending danger. It is ap-prehension only, thank God, that leads me to speak in a tone of such despon-dency. Lady Aubrey assures me, that far from being hurt by the late inter-view, it has soothed and gratified her heart; and even had the violence of her feelings, naturally acute, exhausted her a little for the present, from the kin-dred sensibility of your sympathetic hearts, I foresee in future infinite satisfaction and consolation to my unfortunate niece in the unexpected happiness of your friend-ship and society.
                  The subject was too delicate to admit

of more, and soon after we separated for the night.
                  This morning, when we met at break-fast, Lady Meredith paid us her compli-ments with much kindness, and the ap-pearance of revived spirits. Her niece, she said, her beloved niece, (for she sel-dom mentions her without some epithet expressive of affection) had enjoyed an excellent night's rest, and found herself much refreshed, so I hope in God, Miss Seymour, all our fears were wholly ground-less.
                  On her Ladyship's leaving us imme-diately after breakfast, Mr. Howard in-formed us that he had had a long walk with her in the morning, for she is an early riser, and that it had been produc-tive of a very interesting conversation; in the course of which he had picked up some particulars relative to Lady Aubrey that he was certain we must be eager to learn.
                  
                     
Lady Meredith, he said, had entirely contradicted the report, so universally cir-culated and so generally credited, of La-dy Aubrey's insanity. A fever of the most alarming nature had indeed attacked her brain, and held her life for many weeks suspended; but this was the natu-ral consequence of her misfortunes. Re-turning reason had been the immediate follower of recruited health: and tho' the most mournful depression had wholly banished tranquillity and peace from her bosom, religion the most devout, and re-signation the most humble and sincere, had supported her in the height of mi-sery, and had preserved her from the baneful effects of distraction and despair.
                  When her ill fated marriage took place, she had been but a few weeks in England. She had spent her life abroad, where Lord Embdon had acted at the Court of Turin in a public capacity. She had hitherto enjoyed little personal inter-course

with her numerous relations, and was particularly attached to none of them. Her native country, endeared to her neither by the force of private friendship nor by the insinuating remembrance of early prepossession, it was the inevitable and natural effects of her misfortunes to be disgusted with it, and her departure was a step which delicacy, pride, and af-fliction, all conspired to dictate.
                  The death of Lord Embdon, which happened at this juncture, (a stroke which it is to be hoped his weakly consti-tution rather than his child's calamities had inflicted,) involved the unfortunate daughter in accumulated distress. Thank heaven he died of a complaint wherein the spirits are not supposed by medical people to influence the disorder. He had been for many years afflicted with the stone; and refusing to submit to an ope-ration, fell a sacrifice to that painful dis-ease.
                  
                     
This event, while it dissolved her only remaining tie to England, left her wholly at liberty to pursue her intended scheme of future seclusion. Her grandfather, the old Earl of Aubrey, indeed still sur-vived, and beheld the ruined peace of his family with the weeping eye of a pa-rent. He entreated his grand daughter, the heiress of his possessions, not to desert him in his old age; but as she well knew that an hereditary regard for the succes-sor of his name and titles alone dictated this request, and that wholly governed by a woman who had lived with him for years, his heart but feebly retained the impressions of natural affection, her sense of duty did not interfere with the prose-cution of her intentions.
                  She therefore bade adieu to England; and having for a short time boarded her-self and attendants in the quiet retire-ment of a monastry, she from thence en-quired after an obscure but elegant re-treat,

which an early and tender friend-ship for it's deceased possessor had en-deared to her remembrance; and having purchased it from the present owner, she retired thither with the design of seclud-ing herself for ever from the world.
                  When this resolution was formed, Miss Marsdon was but eighteen, and possessed in the full glow of radience those charms which dejection, disappointment, and in-disposition, for fifteen years more, have scarce been able to impair. Her days, bounded by distress, the dreary prospect admitted no ray of reviving consolation except what resulted from the socety of one dear and maternal friend, who hav-ing been lately deprived of the husband of her heart, and never having been blessed with offspring, flew to indulge with her favorite young friend the un-bounded luxury of sorrow.
                  Madame de St. Hillaire, for some time combated not the intended seclusion

in a soft voice to me, it will be so delight-ful; tho' to own the truth I was afraid that haughty cousin of ours might have stood in the way.
               You are intirely out of the secret, said I. But pray be quiet.
               We were then called to a party at Com-merce, and an end put to our little tete a tete, which merely served to strengthen Fanny in her error. Oh, thought I to myself, while I observed her eyes sparkle with the prospect of a happy termination thus appearing to the uncertainties and difficulties of our present uncomfortable situation, will the same satisfaction brighten your countenance and lighten your heart, my dearest Fanny, when you find you are yourself the object that is to insure us this advantage.
               Captain Wilmot, who has been (per-haps designedly,) out of town ever since our affairs have worn an unfavourable ap-pearance, came in for a few moments.

of her amiable friend. But the violence of her own distress yielding to resignation and composure, she became conscious that tho' grief is seldom abated by reasoning the most convincing and judicious, time will infallibly lessen, and variety in some measure divert, it's bitterness. Her feel-ings, tho' poignant, were soothing and enthusiastic: tears unceasingly fell from her eyes; but they were tears of relief. Some pleasing recollection, some scene, interesting and endearing, often made them flow, and the luxuriant reveries of past delight in a great measure soothed the present sad reverse.
                  Far otherwise was the source of the bitter anguish of her friend. The re-membrance of past affection carried a sting which made her in horror fly from the thought; and the idea that the man she had loved and had lost was torn from her arms by the common stroke of death, supported not her feeling mind in the

height of languor and depression: all was misery unmitigated: the past was hor-ror, and the future presented only unde-served mortification and perpetual regret.
                  In solitude and obscurity were centered the only ideas of dejected tranquillity that could find entrance into the bosom of the fair mourner: a bosom of acute sensibi-lity, chilled by the cold hand of disap-pointment: but her anxious friend, re-flecting on her youth and amiable dispo-sition, hoped that after time had been given for meliorating her sorrows into peaceful resignation, a temper so calcu-lated for the active duties of benevolence would not remain unsubdued by the heartfelt gratifications which that noble principle affords, and foresaw that it would not prove impossible to prevail with her to relax in her present system.
                  Time justified the predictions of this valuable friend. By degrees, at her earnest entreaties, a select acquaintance

was admitted; and altho' through the whole of Lady Aubrey's residence a-broad, till the present moment, a weight of melancholy impaired her health and clouded her spirits, religion and princi-ple co-operating with the continual ef-forts of Madame de St. Hillaire, greatly softened the first anguish of her suffer-ings; and while she remained incapable of participating in the gaieties of life, its rational comforts were restored to her re-lish. Her society, tho' limited, was ele-gant, and judiciously chosen; and her solitary residence at length began to wear the aspect of a peaceful retirement, which the sad stroke of Madame de St. Hil-laire's death, added to the dying request of her grandfather, would probably alone have prevailed with Lady Aubrey ever to have quitted.
                  Lord Aubrey, sinding the infirmities of age overtake him with a hasty pace, the beginning of this year sent an earnest

intreaty to his grand daughter to grant him the satisfaction of beholding once more the last and only supporter of his family and dignities. She hesitated not to obey, however painfully her return to England must awaken every source of anguish, and arrived in London about the end of January, just in time to re-ceive his last injunctions, the old Lord having survived this affecting meeting only a few days.
                  Lady Aubrey now found herself pos-sessed of the accumulated wealth of a long line of noble and opulent ancestry. Independent of those estates which from entail were annexed to the title, her grandfather had left her considerable pro-perty; and he requested that a due re-gard to an ancient and honourable fa-mily, of which she was the head and or-nament, might prevail with her to spend her days in the old family castle; where her predecessors had lived time immemo-rial,

adored by their vassals, respected by their friends, and the pride and blessing of the country around.
                  In addition to these particulars, Lady Meredith mentioned to Mr. Howard, that though from several circumstances which on recollection strike her remem-brance, she conjectures her amiable niece wished her to be made acquainted with the singular event of her rencontre with this famiy, never could she summon cou-rage and calmness sufficient for entering on the painful subject till yesterday evening, when the violence of her emotions ren-dering her aunt at once suspicious and inquisitive, drew the formidable secret from her bosom.
                  Tho' tenderly attached to my niece, said Lady Meredith, the only surviving child of a deceased sister whom I almost idolized, I have not had the happiness, till her late return from abroad, of en-joying much of her company. She has

spent great part of her life on the conti-nent, where it was only in my power to visit her once for a few months; and it is only of late, that strict intimacy and affection have taken place which always indeed subsisted, but in a less powerful degree, between us. Length of absence, and difference of years, have however precluded that unreserved confidence, which, except at the open and undisguised period of early youth, is not easily be-stowed. Aware of the quick sensibility of Lady Aubrey's feelings, I forbore to probe wounds scarce closed, and care-fully avoided every subject likely to re-call the past to her mind: till last night, when the emotion in which I found her paved the way for a communication as unexpected as extraordinary. Lady Au-brey confessed that accident had intro-duced to her knowledge a family, to meet with whom had been her most earnest wish, tho' from a variety of circumstan-ces

she had for ever despaired of enjoying that satisfaction; and that altho' a com-plication of agitating sensations had wholly overpowered her at the first meet-ing, and rendered her so apprehensive of a second as to delay it till returning health and strength might enable her to support the feelings which she knew it must occasion, the inherent satisfaction resulting from the event she was convin-ced would be of infinite benefit both to her health and tranquillity in future.
                  It was not difficult, continued Lady Meredith, to divine who this family must be: and what I have seen of every individual in it, persuades me that Lady Aubrey will not find herself deceived in this flattering expectation.
                  Mr. Howard had just concluded this interesting narrative, when Lady Mere-dith entering the parlour, told us that Lady Aubrey requested our company; and that while we attended her Ladyship

she should accompany Mr. Howard once more in his rambles thro' the wood, as it was impossible ever to tire in walking over so delightful a spot as Hubert Hill, and she had not yet been shewn all the lions.
                  My sister and I then went up stairs. We found our dear Lady Aubrey in bed, for she is not allowed to rise till the morning is far advanced; but she looked more beautiful as she sat upright sup-ported by pillows, than any other wo-man I ever beheld in all the pride of youth, dress, and loveliness.
                  There is an expression of feeling lan-guor in her charming eyes, that would be alone captivating beyond expression, even divested of the aid they receive from the perfection of her other features, and I am not certain if it would be in my power to admire her so enthusiastically was she relieved from those traces of de-cay, which betraying the ravages of la-tent

anguish, bespeak in the same mo-ment the warmest admiration and the most compassionate sympathy. In the bloom of eighteen, Miss Marsdon may have been more beautiful, but could not have proved so interesting, so insinuat-ing as Lady Aubrey appears at this in-stant.
                  She embraced us both tenderly, and apologized for requesting our company at her bed side; but I cannot deny my-self, said she, the gratification of your company from mere motives of cold ce-remony, while my heart is under the in-fluence of sentiments so fervent. I am soothed and gratified beyond expression, continued she. My rest last night was more refreshing and tranquil than any I have enjoyed since my accident, which, far from accounting unfortunate, I shall ever regard as the blessing of providence. With a heart overflowing with gratitude to the Almighty, I offered up my hum-ble

thanks, and composed myself to sleep with an inward sensation of relief and sa-tisfaction, which cast a gleam of content-ment even over my dreams and my re-pose.
                  She appeared indeed calm and com-posed beyond our most sanguine hopes; and tho' a tear of feeling often fell from her eye, and her bosom heaved with an oppression not to be suppressed, a smile of resigned benevolence often broke thro' the sedate melancholy seated on her in-teresting countenance, and her sighs seemed more the offspring of relief than uneasiness.
                  Amidst the effusions of that melting and soothing tenderness which linked our hearts together, and which was tacitly acknowledged to have but one common source in my dear father, yet was his name not once pronounced. Amidst the free and mutual communication which a heart-felt interest claimed, tho' to this

His address to Fanny was constrained; her's to him, haughty, disdainful, and contemptuous. It is not like Fanny to shew so much spirit; but affronted va-nity will it seems excite a pride otherwise foreign to the character. It was easy to discern that he had been apprized of the change in our circumstances. Every word, every look and motion, betrayed not the timidity of a lover but the em-barrassment and perplexity of a man who felt himself involved in difficulties and knew not how to act. I was charmed with Fanny's behaviour. She not only supported her own dignity, but com-pleatly mortified the poor Captain, who tho' happy to be thus dismissed, could not feel much gratified from perceiving the indifference with which the conquest was relinquished.
               When the company were gone, and Fanny and I by ourselves, she interrogated me as to the tete a tete conversation that

every circumstance alluded and every en-quiry tended, it was a point at which none of us could arrive. It seemed too sacred, too aweful to be uttered, and must have led to particulars at which for worlds we would not as yet have ventu-red to hint.
                  Lady Aubrey, however, by degrees informed us of all we were most anxious to know: that during the whole period of our residence abroad she had main-tained a constant correspondence with Mr. Bensley, unknown to every one, and under promise of profound secrecy. Doubtless the appearance of preserving an intercourse of any kind with the a-vowed friend of my father, must have seemed an act of impropriety in the eyes of her own family, and might have been deemed romantic by the world; yet could not this amiable, this angelic woman, remain contentedly ignorant of the fate of a man to whom her whole heart had

once been given up, however unworthy he had proved himself by overwhelming her with unmerited shame and despair, and by driving her, in the gay season of a youth which fortune and nature had conspired to bless with a thousand envied advantages, to bury herself in solitude and obscurity.
                  The desire of addressing myself to Mr. Benseley, said Lady Aubrey, had taken possession of my mind for several months previous to my quitting England. From him only could a thousand circumstances reach my knowledge, which it was abso-lutely essential to my very existence to know, and which to no other person could even be hinted; yet a number of objections, and difficulties almost insur-mountable, deterred me from gratifying a wish that every moment grew more ir-resistible. The awkwardness of an ap-plication by letter appeared formidable, and the apprehension of being detected

in a step which I well knew my father would deem derogatory to my dignity, and fraught with impropriety, terrified me. This last bar was, alas! but too soon removed by that dear parent's death; and yielding to the potency of my anx-iety, I ventured at length to write to Mr. Benseley, and informing him of my resi-dence abroad, where I meant immedi-ately to retire, requested the favor from time to time of hearing from him.
                  By his answer I was relieved from much misery, and spared the anguish of vague and fruitless conjecture. I was made ac-quainted with a thousand particulars, minute and interesting: I was satisfied in the point nearest my heartâ€”the point in-deed which had dictated my ungoverna-ble and eager desire of information. I was informed of your secluded residence in the south of France, and my fervent and incessant prayers to heaven I found were at length answered:â€”remorse the

most poignant succeeded to errors whichâ€”
                  She stopped for a moment, unable to proceed; but recovering herselfâ€”dur-ing this correspondence, continued she, which regularly subsisted between Mr. Benseley and myself till within a fort-night of his death, I was minutely in-formed, according to my most earnest request, of every particular of your man-ner of life, your solitude, your amuse-ments, and the plan of education that had been adopted. All, all was interest-ing to me; and this singular participa-tion in your welfare gave an interest to my existence; and while I deplored the bar that for ever excluded all personal knowledge or intercourse between us, my heart strongly cherished and imbibed a warm and maternal affection, which was daily nourished and encreased by the perusal of letters from Bâ€” with which the worthy Mr. Benseley, indul-gent

to my secret wishes though not to my avowed request, often favoured me. These letters, dated from your solitary abode in Languedoc, written with all the enthusiasm of paternal admiration and affection, repeated with unwearied de-light the virtues, the talents, and accom-plishments of his amiable daughters; and though merely designed for the friendly eye of Mr. Benseley, were faithfully in secret transmitted to me. The returning consolation these epistles indicated thro' the means of his beloved children, to spirits worn out by agonizing repentance and remorse, began at length to afford comfort to mine, and blessing heaven for having touched a heart where virtue though obscured never was eradicated, I in my distant seclusion partook of his revived though dejected tranquillity, and bending with due humility under the just and aweful dispensations of Providence, strove with augmented fortitude to sub-mit

to evils to which it had pleased hea-ven to grant some alleviation.
                  In this way many years rolled on: in compliance with the earnest entreaties of a friend, who partook of my retire-ment and shared my sorrows, I con-sented to admit the society of a few cho-sen acquaintances, and at length began to experience the calm tranquillity, which, where religion possesses a due influence over a mind unburthened with the acute sensations of self reproach, humility and submission always in some measure re-store: yet still the source, after heaven, from whence my chief comfort flowed, was the frequent and interesting intelli-gence which Mr. Benseley's letters, en-closing others from the quiet retreat at Bâ€”, often afforded me; till in Octo-ber last, when a packet from my good friend, which had been anxiously ex-pected for an unusual length of time, was put into my hands. The seal an-nounced

fatal news, and my heart with secret apprehensions died within me.
                  Though the most romantic flight of imagination, continued this amiable wo-man, sighing with a bitterness that seemed to rend her bosom, never flattered me with the possibility of more than merely knowing he lived, and the most miracu-lous fluctuation of human events could grant me nothing beyond what I at pre-sent enjoyedâ€”the cold satisfaction of pe-rusing letters neither addressed to myself nor intended for my view; though the hand of death could scarce place a bar more unsurmountable between us than that which already subsisted; yet to be told that death itself had divided us, over-powered me with a pang yet unfelt, the violence of which appeared astonishing even to myself.
                  Between those calamities, however, with which, by the common lot of mor-tality, we are overwhelmed, and those

which a chequered series of dismal and singular events have produced, a mate-rial difference must ever be felt. The lenient quality that time so powerfully possesses, in mitigating the asperities of the former, proves wholly ineffectual in those afflictions which disappointed af-fection or early mortifications have in-flicted; and I confess this wound, though in the first moments of sorrow not inferior perhaps to any I had endured, reason and reflection much more speedily allayed; unlike the corroding sting which the me-mory of my former miseries perpetually renewed, a soothing and not unpleasing regret now rests on my mind, which, while it melts and subdues my heart, does not raise a blush for the uncon-querable weakness it confesses.
                  This affecting conversation, to which tears on my sister's part and mine were the only interruption, and which made the eyes of our dear and amiable Lady

Aubrey overflow with a bitterness that almost wholly exhausted her, terrified me with the apprehension of her sinking wholly under her agitations. I entreated her to defer for the present all further dis-course on this subject, and to allow of our leaving her. But to this she would not be persuaded to consent. My sor-rows have been of such a nature, said she, that all communication of them is impossible; and confidence, a solace which except with my dear deceased friend Ma-dam de St. Hillaire, I never could enjoy. A painful mixture of shame and pride, encreased perhaps by early prosperity and indulgence, sealed my lips, and confined my sufferings to my own solitary and de-solated bosom; how then can my chil-dren, my dear children, (repeated she, folding us alternately in her arms) deny me the satisfaction of giving vent to griefs in which their sympathetic hearts must feel a generous concern.
                  
                     
You may believe, Sophia, we returned the kind caresses of this amiable friend with all the enthusiastic warmth which a conduct so amiable, so truly great, could not fail to excite in circumstances so sin-gularly interesting.
                  Lady Aubrey then proceeded to in-form us, that Mr. Benseley had minutely acquainted her with all our intended schemes, and had with his usual kindness voluntarily promised, should his declining health permit of such a journey, to pay her a visit in the course of the following summer, attended by his wards; to whom this angelic woman was to have been personally introduced as a lady who ho-nored him with singular marks of friend-ship and regard, but without the slightest hint of any secret connection.
                  To this soothing scheme, said Lady Aubrey, which I had been unceasingly revolving in my mind how to accom-plish, I returned a most grateful and glad

had passed; but I persisted in evading all her enquiries; for it is but justice to al-low Mr. Howard to plead his own cause, while her mind is unbiassed by any pre-vious determination. Let him at least reap what benefit may result from an un-prejudiced surprize on finding herself warmly solicited by a man whom I know she esteems and respects.
               I believe you will not be astonished, when I confess that did I think this a point in which it would be allowable for me to interfere, I should prove a warm advocate in Mr. Howard's favour, and that I anxiously wish this union may take place. Did Fanny's heart feel the slight-est repugnance, far should I be from de-siring an event, against which in that case principle and delicacy would equally revolt: but if she is capable of enter-taining such sentiments as will allow her without reluctance to bestow her hand on that amiable man, I think I could al-most

assent, and requested to know at what time you were expected in England. But alas! to this letter I received no answer. I wrote another, and was informed by a relation, who had opened it after Mr. Benseley's decease, that the worthy man was no more. It is not easy to express the anguish and disappointment I expe-rienced on hearing this dismal intelli-gence. Tho' inured to mortification and regret, I found I had yet much to under-go ere I became callous to their attacks. This blow, by overturning the sole fa-vorite plan on which I had built any re-maining hopes of comfort, sunk me to the lowest state of despondency; and the loss of my invaluable friend, Madame de St. Hillaire, put the finishing stroke to my sufferings.
                  This last calamity pressed hard indeed. In all my other distresses, this beloved friend had been, under heaven, my chief support, and had in some measure sup-plied

the place of all I had lost. I had still a friend to love, a friend who re-turned my warm affection. An early separation from my relations in England, had kept me a stranger to all of them, my aunt, Lady Meredith excepted, and she I had known for too short a period to feel for her that attachment which now fills my heart. I was then berest of my last, my only friend. Ah! can human misery present a more dismal picture to a heart of sensibility, than the melancholy consideration that none exists to animate the feelings of fervent affection.
                  Still, however, the only form in which alleviation touched my bosom, was the hopes of one day meeting with you; and revolving on the means to procure my-self this consolation, in some measure dissipated my gloomy reflections. I knew not where, or to whom to apply for in-formation; and was in this state of me-lancholy and uncertainty, when the ac-count

of my Lord Aubrey's illness and request to see me arrived. Painful as was the idea of revisiting England, I he-sitated not instantly to comply: and my repugnance was in a great measure sub-dued, by the hopes of gaining some in-formation relative to you, tho' to chance alone I could owe the intelligence, Lit-tle likelihood indeed remained of success. A cruel peculiarity of circumstances de-prived me of any light to guide my re-searches, and an open and avowed pursuit was precluded me. Yet the possibility soothed and supported my spirits; and it was not till I had been some weeks in London, that I found how totally im-practicable it was to discover a private family whose names must ever be care-fully guarded from my ears. My own maid, who had been with me from my early youth, I ventured to entrust with the enquiry, and two different channels of information occurred; by means of La-dy

Linrose's servants, with one of whom she was acquainted; and if this failed, Mr. Benseley's relation might be applied to; but that gentleman I found was lately gone to Holland; and when I addressed myself by letter to him on the subject, he assured me in answer that the ladies names were as wholly unknown to him as was their abode; and Lady Linrose's maid also informed mine that she did not be-lieve two such relations were expected by the family, nor had she learnt that any account of them had been received.
                  Worn out by successive disappoint-ments, I could only conjecture that you were still in Languedoc; and unwillingly constrained to relinquish this pursuit, I prepared myself for taking possession of my country residence according to the dying request of Lord Aubrey, where I was anxious to find myself calmly settled. Fatigued with the civilities and attentions paid me by a numerous class of distant

relations and family acquaintance, who crowded on me immediately on my ar-rival, I determined to set out for Aubrey Castle even at that unpropitious season of the year, in defiance of sundry remon-strances from my friends, and contrary to the wishes of my kind aunt, who pro-mised to follow when the spring was fur-ther advanced. How shall I ever bless this resolution, concluded Lady Aubrey, how fervently shall my grateful prayers ascend to the Almighty, for having in-spired a measure from which I have de-rived such unspeakable comfort.
                  Shall not we too bless heaven, cried I, every hour of our lives, for the fortunate and providential rencontre. Ah! had we known, while we remained in that inhospitable city disowned and un-friendedâ€”had we but suspected that it contained one kind, invaluable friend, who could have participated in our diffi-culties, soothed our disappointments, and

aided us with comfort and advice, what an altered aspect must it not have worn. Lady Aubrey's kind interest would have compensated for every mortification, her friendship would have supported us un-der every reverse, and blest in her society, the cruelty of our relations would have lost the severe pang it inflicted.

                  Lady Aubrey finds herself now so much recovered, that the physicians de-clare their attendance no longer necessary, and she is now left to Mr. Rudder's care, who generally visits her twice a day.
                  I have insisted on attending her con-stantly; and instead of ceremoniously re-fusing my assistance, she receives it with undisguised pleasure, and regards my solicitude and anxiety with a warmth of gratitude which would a thousand times

repay my fatigues, were they even as severe as she perpetually imagines them to be; but the permission of being con-stantly with her, is a privilege and indul-gence which I would not for the world relinquish. She is still very weak; and I am so peremptory in the duties of my office as nurse, that I will not allow of her conversing on subjects which I know must agitate and affect her. This morn-ing, however, she entreated me to ac-quaint her where and in what manner we had lived since our arrival in England, and I gave her a brief account of our si-tuation. This I could not possibly con-trive to do, without touching on our disappointment in regard to Lord Bel-mont: but I passed over it as slightly as was in my power. She sighed bitterly however at my relation: alas! said she, how differently men feel: even in his place I should have taken you with de-light to my bosom.
                  
                     
In talking of pecuniary matters, I mentioned my obligations to Mr. Roats-ley. Yet, Sophia, dearly as I love and respect Lady Aubrey, I could not confess more. Shame tied my tongue, and my cheeks even glowed on repeating his name. I have heard a great character of that young man abroad, said she. He spent some weeks at Lisle, where he was much caressed and admired; but as I ne-ver quitted my home, and never enlarg-ed the private circle who sometimes fa-vored me with their visits, I was spared all chance of meeting with him.
                  
                     Adieu. H. SEYMOUR.
                  
               
            
            
               

pronounce her felicity in the mar-riage state secured; and what a happy asylum in our present situation must the house of Mr. Howard prove, when au-thorised to live under his continued pro-tection by the ties of relationship as well as by those of friendship. It is indeed an event which must at once relieve us from the difficulties that seem to await our un-connected state. Yet you may conjec-ture I would not for worlds insinuate a hint towards urging her to a step with which, in her place, I feel at this moment I myself could not comply.
               My sister seemed disappointed on find-ing her conjectures had been without foundation, and warmly joined in sound-ing the praises of Mr. Howard; adding, that in spite of the disproportion of our ages there was no man she would esteem so highly as a brother. Yet Sophia, dis-interested as we sometimes flatter our-selves we are, we view with different

               LETTER XVI. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     MAY 13.
                  
               
               LADY Meredith left us some days ago. Her old man at home, she said, would be impatient for her return, and she was sensible to what admirable hands she entrusted the care of her dear niece's health. The interval since I last wrote, has indeed produced a change so favora-ble in Lady Aubrey's health, that she is able to join us in the parlour; and finds herself so well, that she talks of leaving Hubert Hill in a few days. This reso-lution we have all combated with all the arguments and entreaties possible; but

she tells us seriously that she really longs to find herself tranquilly established in her new residence; and we have at length, tho' with great unwillingness, given up our importunities.
               You may believe I readily and joyfully consented to her earnest request of ac-companying her to Aubrey Castle, where Mr. and Mrs. Howard are to follow when some little business which at present detains the former here is concluded.
               
                  
                     
                        MAY 20.
                     
                  
                  I am still at Hubert Hill. Our be-loved Lady Aubrey set off this morning by herself. This change in our plans is occasioned by an indisposition which has seized my sister, and which, without be-ing in the least alarming, renders her low spirited and opprest. I should have been uneasy at leaving her in her present

situation; and Lady Aubrey, had I in-clined, would not have desired it. She has contented herself therefore with ex-acting Mr. Howard's promise to carry us both to her in a short time, when his business is finished and my sister's health re-established.
                  Short as is to be this interval of ab-sence, we did not separate without tears. How gracious, Sophia, have been the dispensations of Providence towards us: when we have imagined ourselves de-serted by the whole world, Mr. Howard excepted, and felt ourselves outcasts from our family, with what augmented relish must we not enjoy the soothing idea of possessing a tender and invaluable friend, who gratifies our hearts every moment with new proofs of attachment, and to whom our tenderness and regard are e-qually essential. What a new source of happiness has this unexpected connexion produced.
               
               
                  
                     

                     JUNE 3.
                  
                  Mr. Howard, who is ever anxious to afford us such amusements as the unifor-mity of our tranquil stile of life admits, asked me on Tuesday morning if I chose to accompany him in an excursion on horseback towards a part of the country that was entirely new to me, and beauti-fully romantic. I gladly consented; but just as we were equipt for our little ex-cursion, his attorney from town arrived on business, and perceiving how incon-venient his leaving home must prove, I insisted on prosecuting my expedition without him; and merely taking old James the gardener, who has past his days in the county, as my escort.
                  Fanny was lazy, and would not be per-suaded to stir from her work; so I set off about eleven, the morning being deli-cious

for the season, eager to explore some particular picturesque scenes which Mr. Howard had described as admirable subjects for my pencil.
                  The country around was so singularly beautiful, that I was tempted to go on further than I at first intended; for as we are regular people at Hubert Hill, and keep early hours, I wished to be home by two o'clock; but the sight of a very fine country seat at no great distance induced me to prolong my ride, from the desire of admiring it on a nearer view.
                  I had just turned the wall of a park that surrounded a house of a very noble appearance, which James, to whom I applied for information, acquainted me was called Holtenham Abbey, when a party of gentlemen and ladies issuing from a gate, with the intention of cross-ing the road, made my mare plunge, and unable to recover my seat, I was

thrown from it with such violence that screams resounded from every voice.
                  Happily I did not suffer from any in-tanglement with the stirrup or accoutre-ments, and felt at the moment no other bad consequences from the fall, than the painful one of confusion at having so many people to witness this awkward ac-cident, added to that dismay which the sudden shock unavoidably occasioned me.
                  I believe half a dozen gentlemen at least flew instantly to my assistance, to raise me from the ground, where, con-founded and without motion, I lay for some moments. Good heavens, Madam, exclaimed they all, one after another, how do you find yourself? I hope you are not hurt? Where have you suffered? and the rest of the company, who seemed dispersed in walking parties of two or three together, just then coming up, I felt myself nearly as severely stunned by the successive repetitions of the same en-quiries,

to which at first I was unable to make any reply, as I was by the fall it-self. Smelling bottles were presented me from all quarters; yet some little time elapsed before I could even recollect my-self sufficiently to express my thanks for the kindness and humanity of their solici-tude.
                  An elderly lady, who appeared parti-cularly concerned for me, and who seemed to be owner of the noble mansion, insisted, the moment I was a little reco-vered, on having me conveyed into the house, from which an avenue of no great length only divided us; and asked me, with much civility and tenderness, if I found it impossible with assistance to walk towards it.
                  Happy to escape from the company, and embarrassed by the curiosity and no-tice I excited, I thankfully accepted this obliging offer, and made a feeble attempt to move forward.
                  
                     
Pray allow me the honor of conduct-ing you, said a young man, who had obliged me to lean on his arm, but whose face from perturbation I had not yet dis-tinguished: the voice, however, was fa-miliar to my ears, and on regarding him I recollected my assistant to be Captain Bradshaw, the friend of Roatsley, against whom, notwithstanding that circum-stance, I had conceived no small degree of prejudice, from causes which you will I am certain recollect.
                  At the instant I cast my eyes on him, Miss Seymour, I believe, said he, and bowed with a diffidence that testified he had not forgotten the self-introduction to which he owed the acquaintance.
                  The old lady then led the way; and I slowly followed, supported by Mr. Brad-shaw, without whose assistance I now found I should have been unable to have stirred, from a severe sprain in my foot. Indeed so painful did it feel, that had not

my anxiety to escape from observation supplied me with fortitude to endure the uneasiness that walking occasioned, I should have concluded moving impossi-ble.
                  Most of the ladies seemed inclined to accompany us, tho' I very earnestly en-treated that I might not be the means of interrupting their walk. My worthy pa-troness however perceiving their intended civility considerably encreased my per-plexity, immediately said, pray ladies and gentlemen don't let this accident in-terfere with your rambles: since it has not, thank heaven, turned out very un-happily, Mr. Bradshaw and I shall attend the young lady; and saying this, she made a motion with her hand, which obliged the whole party, tho' with seeming reluc-tance, to leave us; for so powerfully does curiosity and the love of novelty prevail in most dispositions, that perceiving I was not a severe sufferer from the accident,

the company appeared to regard it as a little adventure, the conclusion of which they should not have been sorry to have witnessed.
                  When we reached the house, at which I did not arrive without considerable dif-ficulty, the door was opened by a foot-man, who ushered us into a superb par-lour, where a young lady apparently of about seventeen, who might have sat for the picture of Hebe, was placed by the fire with a book in her hand.
                  She seemed to have been confined by some slight ailment, having a large cap and hood tied carelessly under her chin.
                  I have brought you an unfortunate in-valid, Miss Lucy, cried my conductress, and explained my accident in a few words, while Mr. Bradshaw flew to pro-cure me a glass of cold water.
                  Good God, Madam, what a shocking accident! cried the young lady with much kindness. How dreadfully pale

eyes the same object when regarded as our own choice or as that of even our dearest and most intimate friend; and forcible as were Fanny's expressions, I cannot conjecture with any degree of cer-tainty how she will act. My influence over her mind is not trifling; but even were I still more convinced than I am that I should ascertain her happiness by promoting this affair, I should not possess resolution sufficient for interfering on a point of such infinite moment, especially at this time, when a peculiar delicacy de-ters me. Fanny, on my account as well as her own, may wish to conquer a re-luctance so adverse to our mutual comfort and which so many powerful motives of prudence and reason oppose, while at the same time this conflict may prove so se-vere, that it were cruelty to advise a step which may in this case be denominated a sacrifice.
               
                  

you look: pray where are you hurt? I hope not severely? and no sooner had I acknowledged that I suspected my foot had been slightly dislocated, than she in-sisted on supporting me into her dressing room; where, while the lady of the house dispatched a servant for a neigh-bouring surgeon, this amiable stranger assisted her maid in chafing my foot with Goulard and water to allay the swel-ling, which had encreased rapidly from the effort of walking.
                  Lady Mary, for so I found this hospita-ble old lady was called, ordered wine and cordials of all kinds to be instantly brought, which she insisted on adminis-tering to me with a benevolence that displayed her character in a point of view so humane as to give me the most fa-vourable opinion of her heart. Her young friend was if possible still more kind and equally anxious to provide every thing for my ease and comfort. My foot

however grew more uneasy, and soon be-came so swelled as to be perfectly stiff and extremely painful.
                  Finding myself worse, I was appre-hensive of being laid up with this stranger family, which spite of their civility and goodness might have proved as inconve-nient for them as disagreeable to myself: I made therefore as light of the accident as I possibly could; assured the ladies it was quite trifling, and insisted on re-mounting my mare and returning home; promising to walk her gently, and plead-ing the terror my sister must endure at my unaccountable length of absence.
                  The surgeon made his appearance just as I spoke, and joined the ladies in re-garding this proposal as absolute frenzy. There is no treating casualties of such a nature in this manner, Madam, said he, with much pomposity, and though it is to be hoped that ten days confinement, with proper care, may effect a cure, as

many weeks, if you are imprudent, may not set you again on foot.
                  If I was your father or mother, my dear Madam, cried Lady Mary, or any relation who possessed authority or influ-ence over you, I should not only now, but for ever prohibit your again ventur-ing on the back of that fiery, dangerous animal. I can no way reconcile myself, added she, to the present prevailing mode of ladies becoming professed jockies; an unaccountable passion for the masculine accomplishment of horsemanship seems now a days to have extended even to our sex, and it must certainly be acknow-ledged the least graceful and most absurd custom that fashion ever introduced among females. I am sure it persuades many a timid girl to brave dangers from which, under any other form, she would shrink with terror: but the ton is not only a sufficient apology for such enterprizes, but a support likewise. Excuse the free-dom

of my observation, dear Madam, continued she with a good humoured smile, and pray give me leave to send to inform your friends that you are safe and in good hands.
                  I returned a thousand thanks to Lady Mary for her benevolent civilities; but entreated she would not insist on my stay as I acknowledged myself extremely anx-ious to get home, and assured her there was not the slightest probable danger in my returning on horseback, as my mare was remarkably safe, and my fall had merely resulted from the sudden appear-ance of some of the company, which had startled her.
                  As to your going on horseback, cried she, pray talk of it no more, for indeed you must not think of such imprudence. However, since you are so very eager to leave us, I really wish it was in my power to contrive your removal in the way that would the least subject you to

inconvenience and uneasiness; but un-fortunately I have at present no carriage to offer you; my niece's chariot requir-ing some alterations, was left behind us in town, so that for some weeks we shall have no equipage but my coach, which a lady, who is just now my guest, got this morning to pay a visit in the neigh-bourhood, and I am really uncertain whe-ther or not she will be home till the even-ing. Pray, my dear, turning to her young friend, is there any hopes, think you, that Lady Linrose will behave bet-ter than her promise, and return to us before dinner.
                  Conceive my regret and astonishment, Sophia, at the sound of a name I so lit-tle expected to hear, and imagine to your-self my concern upon finding there was so much probability of my meeting with her Ladyship, which her return every instant might subject me to; a mortifica-tion which of all things on earth I most

wished to avoid. I was thunderstruck on perceiving myself plunged into a situ-ation so awkward, and changed colour so rapidly, that had not the ladies been happily otherwise engaged, they must have remarked my emotion.
                  I am indeed afraid, Madam, replied Miss Lucy, that my mother's return will hardly leave time sufficient for the young lady's removal this evening; for you know Mrs. Pelcourt and she are old friends; they must always have a long chat when they meet, and I make no doubt that if she insists on it, my mother will pass the day with her.
                  
                     Her mother. Here was a fresh sur-prise, which wholly disconcerted me. To find myself all at once involved in difficulties so singular and unlooked for, surrounded by relations who had behaved so unworthily by me, and who must feel themselves, when they made the disco-very, so ashamed, so vexed at the ren-contre,

threw me into a confusion and perplexity not to be expressed; and the idea that it was not impossible but Roats-ley himself might be of the party, put the finishing stroke to my embarrassment.
                  You will ask, I know, Sophia, why I, who was on this occasion the suffering person, who had done no injury to La-dy Linrose, and who had no cause to blush for my conduct towards her or her family, should undergo such apprehen-sions at the thoughts of seeing her:â€”ap-prehensions that ought only to have at-tended the consciousness of misconduct. I own there might have been more spirit perhaps in braving than in yielding to my present feelings; but the certainty of plunging a whole family into confusion was by no means either soothihg to my pride or gratifying to my resentment. I felt myself an unwelcome intruder, who was about to create disturbance and un-easiness, and I sunk under the dread of the scene that awaited me.
                  
                     
Come, dear Madam, cried Lady Ma-ry, finding I was silent, this day at least you must be contented to remain my guest: to-morrow, if you continue thus impatient, my carriage shall attend your commands; but in the mean time pray allow me to ask whither the message shall be directed with the assurances of your safety?
                  You are all goodness, Madam, said I at length, and I am truly ashamed of appearing thus obstinate and ungrateful; but indeed business of real moment, bu-siness of the last importance, renders my absence from home so particularly un-fortunate, that my stay is impossible.
                  I spoke with an energy that I believe surprised them, and must have surmount-ed all opposition had my removal been practicable.
                  Since the lady is so eager to be gone, said the surgeon, I think she might be conveyed with tolerable safety in a coach,

where her leg might be extended at ease on the opposite seat; but as for any other mode of travelling, particularly on horse-back, that, Madam, addressing himself to me with much importance, you would find not merely inconvenient but painful in the extreme, and really when patients refuse to be directed by their medical at-tendants, they undoubtedly cannot be-come responsible for the consequences of imprudence.
                  The awkwardness of my situation giv-ing defiance to all alarm, I was beyond measure provoked with the pedantic pa-rade of this man, who made my deter-mination to depart appear still more stub-born and unaccountable: but the mo-ment he left the room, I enquired, tho' with many expressions of gratitude and obligation, if a carriage could not be procured from the neighbouring village.
                  It is a poor little place, answered Lady Mary, and boasts of no conveyance be-yond

a cart. I believe a hired chaise might indeed be had from Nâ€”; but 'tis twelve miles distant, and it must be so late before it could arrive, that I should imagine a few hours could make little difference. 'Tis already almost two; and before a servant could go and return, the night must be far advanced: at all events to-morrow you shall have my coach; and tho' I ought to ask pardon for importun-ing you so much, I must confess that I secretly suspect this business of impor-tance to be nothing more than a pretext under which you wish to relieve the fears of your family in person. Now, my dear Madam, be assured I shall be most happy to be favoured with the company of any of your friends who on this oc-casion may chuse to visit you, and as a message to that effect can be instantly dispatched by your own servant, some of your family will join you in a few hours.
                  This is a plan, cried Miss Lucy with

            HERMIONE.
            
               LETTER XIII. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     FEB. 20.
                  
               
               I COULD not contrive to meet with Mr. Howard till dinner was announced, at which he seemed absent and absorbed; but as I then sat next him, I asked him to allow me to talk with him when we left the table.
               It is just the request I was going to make, said he: and when the ladies re-tired to tea and coffee, under pretence of business he made his excuses to the gen-tlemen and joined me in Mrs. Hindon's dressing room.
               No time is to be lost, dear Sir, said I to him the moment he entered, in chang-ing

                  
                     
                        SUNDAY EVENING.
                     
                  
                  On our return from morning prayers, I retired to read in my own apartment. Fanny remained in the parlour below, but joined me an hour after in the utmost per-turbation. On entering, she hastily ap-proached me, and throwing her arms around my neck, burst into a flood of tears, which instantly informed me of what she was unable by words to express.
                  My dearest girl, said I, whence pro-ceeds this agitation?
                  She could not immediately reply: but at lastâ€”Oh Hermione! exclaimed she, what have I to tell youâ€”Mr. Howard is my lover.
                  Well my dear, said I smiling, that is no very great calamity.
                  Good, heavens! could you ever have suspected such a thing? Could you ever have imagined that any thing so unlucky would have happened!
                  I believe I could, answered I. But

the utmost kindness, which cannot fail to render you perfectly at ease; so do pray, dear Madam, be prevailed with at least to continue with us till to-morrow.
                  My situation became now more distres-sing than ever. I at last determined on dispatching James in all haste to Hubert Hill, with orders instantly to return with Mr. Howard's one horse chair, and this plan I flattered myself would save me the mortification of the impending meeting, as in all likelihood it would arrive before Lady Linrose returned from her visit.
                  Yet a thousand different reasons ren-dered this scheme, tho' the best I could devise at the time, defective and un-comfortable. Lady Linrose I might by this means avoid; but her son might still be of the party; he, and the rest of the family, I might still encounter; and the late pecuniary transactions that had taken place since we last met, the indigent light in which I had been represented to

him, and the pride and incivility of his behaviour on the discovery he had so re-cently made, all conspired to make me wish myself in any quarter of the globe at that instant rather than under the same roof with him. A confusion of painful and even opposite sensations agitated and perplexed me, while I felt proud, piqued, and displeased. I was sunk, humbled, and dejected, and tears, owing their source less to mortification than sensibility, threatened every moment to burst from my eyes.
                  This plan, however, I now discovered with bitter dismay, was impracticable, for the day had suddenly changed it's as-pect, and it rained with great violence; and tho' I would with pleasure have de-fied any inconveniency, I knew not how to insist further on departing without in-curring the imputation of being self-wil-led and capricious. The weather equally prohibited every mode of travelling, ex-cepting

that which was not to be procur-ed; therefore all resistance was at an end; and it only remained that I should en-deavour to comply with a good grace to this cruel necessity. My countenance, I am afraid, betrayed my feelings; for my two amiable companions joined in intreat-ing me to make myself easy, and be-sought me to lose no time in dispatching my servant home with Lady Mary's kind message to my friends.
                  Just as they spoke, two ladies entered the dressing room. May I use the free-dom to enquire for the young lady, said one of them, (whom I recollected to have been particularly obliging and attentive to me at the moment of my accident,) I was sorry to learn below that it had been found necessary to call a surgeon.
                  His attendance Madam, answered I, was wholly unnecessary, as a slight sprain is all the inconvenience my fall has occa-sioned; and I am sure I ought not to re-gret

an accident to which I owe so much kindness and civility.
                  Indeed I am extremely sorry you have been so unfortunate, returned she; tho' we have profited so much from the event, that if it is only the means of confining you with us for some little time, we shall find difficulty enough in regretting it.
                  I endeavoured to return an answer ex-pressive of my satisfaction on having en-countered a family whose humanity did so much honor to their characters; but my mind was uneasy, and I fear my looks contradicted my words.
                  Yes, cried Lady Mary, interrupting, me, yet you were so extremely unwilling to trust yourself, tho' but for a single night, with this same hospitable family, that do you know, niece, our invalid in-sisted on returning upon the identical horse that gave us all this alarm, in spite of the surgeon's denunciation against so imprudent a scheme.
                  
                     
Good heavens! dear Madam, what an idea! But I hope you have entirely given up all thoughts of such a plan.
                  Before I proceed, however, in my ac-count of this formidable day, I must in-terrupt the present conversation by giving you a description of this lady, whose manners and conversation appear so affa-ble and engaging. I told you there were two who entered together; but the friend who accompanied this engaging young lady, and on whose arm she hung, was remarkable for nothing but an air of sycophantish obsequiousness, which in-stantly informed me she resided in the fa-mily in the comfortable capacity of an humble friend.
                  The young lady herself appeared about twenty. Her extreme height, which rendered her figure at first sight remarka-ble, had not imbibed the slightest degree of that awkwardness which often in very tall people precludes grace; on the con-trary,

her form was uncommonly ele-gant, and her features, tho' not so regu-lar on examination as a first glance lead me to conclude, being embellished by a very beautiful complexion, and her shape improved by an easy air, fully entitled her to the encomium of being what is generally esteemed a prodigious fine woman. You will presently discover, Sophia, why my pen is so minute in it's descriptions.
                  I was much embarrassed how to make an adequate return to so much civility, and yet retain in my own option the power of departing should an opportunity offer.
                  I hope you will believe Ladies, said I at length, that on any other occasion I should have been beyond measure grati-fied with an opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance, which even by anticipa-tion gives me the most sincere pleasure; but this day my leaving home is so singu-larly inconvenient, that I must confess I

shall not be quite at ease till I find my-self there; and if the evening improves, I hope you will neither conclude me un-grateful nor obstinate, if I still persist in my first intentions. Hubert Hill is not, by my servant's account, above seven or eight miles distant, and I mean to send him off directly with orders to return with Mr. Howard's little carriage, which if the afternoon proves tolerable, is a very easy conveyance.
                  Oh no doubt he will send his coach for you, cried the young lady. But are you quite determined to leave us?
                  Mr. Howard? said Lady Mary. I have the pleasure of knowing him well, and an excellent man he is. I was indeed told that he had lately entered into the mar-ried state, but I did not know how for-tunate he had been.
                  Perceiving her mistake, I presently un-deceived her by saying that my sister was equally so in her union with a man of his singular worth.
                  
                     
I make no doubt of it, returned she: Mr. Howard is a character of uncommon merit, whose connexion must confer hap-piness on any family with whom he is al-lied. I had at all events intended my-self the honor of waiting upon him and his new married lady, but I shall now have an additional motive.
                  Both Mr. Howard and my sister, I told her, would be much flattered with the intended favor; and added, that my bro-ther's one horse chair would prove a safe and comfortable conveyance for my re-turn, as in spite of my apparent courage I felt no inclination to venture on horse-back, since a more agreeable method of getting home could be adopted.
                  It was wonderful to observe the sud-den change which this last speech effected upon the manners of the young lady whose affability had hitherto appeared so engaging. An expression of surprize, which her countenance betrayed, might

have passed unnoticed, as also the obser-vation of her companion, who had not as yet articulated one syllable, but had remained in respectful silence till a faint smile from her young patroness induced her to say, truly it may prove a very safe, but surely it can't prove a very comfortable conveyance in such an evening as this promises to be.
                  The alteration which took place in the behaviour of the other, soon after con-vinced me I had considerably abated of my importance in her eyes, from being known. She immediately walked to-wards the window; her friend followed, and they whispered together some mi-nutes, while the bell summoned Miss Lucy's maid to dispatch James to Hu-bert Hill.
                  So tis only the people at the little white house on the hill, said the young lady in a low voice which I could distinctly over-hear while the message was transacting;

her friend replied with so much caution that I could only distinguish the words, quite private sort of people, I assure your Ladyship.
                  Lady Mary looked towards them as if uneasy at their behaviour, and address-ing herself to her niece, endeavoured to engage her in general conversation: but evidently undeceived as to the fancied importance of the visitor, her looks of civility and expressions of kindness were converted into silent indifference and haughty unconcern; and as if her curio-sity had been now thoroughly satisfied, she soon after left the room.
                  Well, Miss Seymour, cried Lady Ma-ry, whether you leave us or not, pray, while we have the pleasure of your com-pany, don't let us deprive the rest of my guests of partaking of it. I hope you are able to walk into the next room.
                  The amiable Miss Dudley then insist-ing that I should take the assistance of

why unlucky? How comes it that the mere mention of a proposal which must be at least acknowledged disinterested, from an amiable and worthy object, should give you this uneasiness. There are no rigid guardians to urge your com-pliance, nor, alas! parents to command your obedience; and believe me, my love, your sister will not even presume to ad-vise on a subject in which your own feel-ings and sentiments only are to be con-sulted.
                  I soon found, however, that her tears were those of agitation, doubt, and timi-dity. Disgust and repugnance had no part in her emotions. She confessed she esteemed Mr. Howard; that she believed him one of the best men in the world; but I never once thought of being his wife, said she. I regarded him as a friend sent by heaven to console us for the loss of one parent who is gone for ever, and of another who disowns us. I cannot

her arm, I made shift, tho' with no small degree of pain, to walk into the drawing room, which was luckily on the same floor.
                  When we entered, we found several gentlemen and ladies differently employ-ed: the young lady before mentioned was placed at the harpsichord, surround-ed by most of the former, whom she seemed enchanting by the divine power of music. Our appearance interrupted her for a moment; but after slightly bowing, she continued her concerto.
                  The gentlemen all advanced, and made their enquiries after me with great po-liteness. I cast my eyes over them with an anxious look, and a sensation of some-thing not unlike disappointment, on per-ceiving that Roatsley was not of the party, discovered to me that I should not have been quite so sorry to have beheld him as I had imagined.
                  Captain Bradshaw, the only person in

company whom till that morning I had ever set eyes on, appeared to regard him-self as an acquaintance, and paid me par-ticular attention. Ah, Sophia! how do trifles, as I have more than once ob-served, often influence us. This young man, against whom I had cherished no small degree of dislike, now no longer appeared what I used formerly to consider him. Nothing had occurred to alter my prejudice; yet it was already gone. I could regard him only as the friend of Roatsley; as his friend, I was convinced he must have merit; and the attentions of that friend could not but prove agree-able to me.
                  The certainty too of making him ab-jure his injurious opinion of me, grati-fied my pride, and the idea, supposing Roatsley was not at Holtenham, that on their next meeting Captain Bradshaw might chance to mention me to him, gave life to my conversation, even while

my spirits were every moment sinking under the apprehension of the return of Lady Linrose.
                  I could not help feeling confounded, when Miss Lucy Dudley, taking her re-ference from Mr. Bradshaw, called me occasionally Miss Seymour. The name, it is true, could lead to nothing, yet the certainty that she must have heard of me under that appellation confused me.
                  Oh! with what pleasure did I contem-plate the countenance of the only female relation, my sister excepted, whom I ever recollect to have seen, and how did I trace all the amiable qualities in its ex-pression which Miss Parsons's letter lead me to expect. Miss Jenny kindly tells me, that a family likeness between her features and mine augmented the parti-ality she was inclined to feel for her. Ah! Sophia! do you imagine that a strong and remarkable resemblance to her bro-ther diminished the affection I was dis-posed

to retain for her, from the mo-ment she was introduced to me.
                  The instant I was presented to her, I thought I remembered having seen her before; but it was not immediately that I recollected her to be the young lady who once occasioned me a pang, (I am sorry to confess it,) not unlike jealousy on perceiving her seated next her brother at the Opera, the evident object of his peculiar regard. There is the strongest similarity in the tones of their voices, which are both uncommonly pleasing, and something even in their turn of ex-pression so much alike, that the sweet Lucy recalled her brother every instant to my mind. Indeed, independent of this prepossession, her countenance and manners convey an idea of such infinite sweetness and sensibility, that I think at all times I must have been partial to her.
                  She had placed herself on the sopha by me; but in spite of her evident wish to

lessen the awkwardness of my situation, surrounded by a large company to whom but two hours before I had been acciden-tally introduced, and not one of whose names, (Captain Bradshaw's excepted,) I even knew, you may believe the con-versation was not kept up without visible difficulty.
                  At this time the young lady, before so particularly described, sat at her harpsi-chord rattling over some little cotillion tunes, and occasionally interrupting her-self to laugh and chat with several gen-tlemen who leant over her chair. Indeed I soon perceived the music was only a pretence to render the conversation, of which the poor stranger was evidently the topic, less remarked. She often looked at me herself, and carried the eyes of the gentlemen to examine me, while she continued her discourse in a half whisper, which the jumbling of the keys prevented my overhearing.
                  
                     
She appeared in great spirits; but an affectation too visible in every motion destroyed at least to me the natural grace of her appearance. I began to suspect she might be Miss Dudley; which idea prevented me from gratifying my curio-sity by means of her sister, and I em-ployed myself ineffectually in trying to discover a resemblance in her features either to those of Miss Lucy or her bro-ther.
                  At length,however, on that young lady's being called to the end of the room to examine some music, I enquired of Captain Bradshaw the name of the lady at the harpsichord; adding, I was so singularly situated as to be a stranger to the whole company.
                  Is it possible you should be ignorant of it, said he in a tone of surprize. It is the celebrated and admired Lady Eliza-beth Sedley, whom I am certain you must at least have heard of often.
                  
                     
Sophia, conceive, if you can, my feel-ings at this information. Ah! no! it is impossible: for except in a similar situ-ation, they are not to be conceived. My heart beat violently, even while a sudden faintness came over me, and I fear my agitation must have been too apparent, for Miss Lucy just then returning to her seat, said with much sweetnessâ€”I am afraid, Miss Seymour, your foot is more uneasy than you will own, for you look extremely pale; and Mr. Bradshaw fixed his eyes on me with a look of investigation that soon changed my complexion from the palid to a deeper dye.
                  The gentlemen now approaching the sopha, the harpsichord seemed deserted; and so I imagine thought Lady Elizabeth, for advancing towards us, she called out in a tone of careless familiarity, I am a-fraid, Miss Seymour, this will be a mi-serable afternoon for your excursion in the one horse chair, for it rains extremely hard.
                  
                     
The voice in which she pronounced these words let me into a secret that I had before half suspected, viz. that the mean-ness of my equipage had so much lowered me in her Ladyship's estimation, as to produce the change in her manner for which I had not been able to assign any other motive.
                  I know not whether Miss Dudley felt the indelicacy of her behaviour, but she immediately said, it is indeed extremely unfortunate, since Miss Seymour is so anxious to go, that Mamma should have occupied Lady Mary's coach to-day; for these little carriages, tho' mighty pleasant in fine weather, are not well adapted for rain.
                  Oh in such an evening the thing is im-possible, cried all the gentlemen at once. Miss Seymour cannot surely think of it.
                  It rained indeed harder than ever; and I was truly provoked by a change of weather so teizing and unlucky. My

foot was painful, my mind uneasy, I re-quired rest for both, and here I was not likely to enjoy ease in any form.
                  A carriage was soon after heard driv-ing up to the door, and my heart panted with expectation. I was convinced it was Mr. Roatsley, and no longer har-boured a doubt when I heard Mr. Brad-shaw call out, I dare say it is Roatsley, and instantly went out to meet him.
                  My perturbation, however, was not of long continuance; for this speech con-vinced me that tho' he might be expected he made not one of the family; and pre-sently after Mr. Bradshaw returned, ac-companied by Sir Edward Sudbury.
                  He met with a very gracious reception from the whole company, particularly from Lady Elizabeth, who seemed much pleased by his entrance. As he did not immediately recognize me amongst so large a company, I began to imagine that perhaps he designed to conduct himself

with a prudent reserve; and recollecting his advances in town, which had been in-terrupted by my departure, now absence had probably cooled his flame, he might incline to keep at a distance and withdraw his notice by degrees.
                  I soon found, however, how unjust was this surmise, when Sir Edward, dis-covering me, approached with his usual modesty and politeness, a glow of satis-faction being visible on his countenance.
                  He enquired with anxiety after my health, then for my sister and Mr. How-ard, and regretted in strong terms my un-expected departure from town, which he said had astonished him, as he had no doubt of finding me at Mrs. Hindon's on his return from a short visit he had made in the country about that time.
                  Dinner was soon after announced; and tho' with pain I walked into the parlour, supported by the arm of the sweet Lucy, who gaily ordered all the gentlemen to

think of marrying him. The idea is al-most unnatural; for the possibility of such an event never entered my imagina-tion. Indeed I always concluded his partiality to me was that of a father, and that the disparity of our years would have alone proved sufficient to have prevented the very notion of such an attachment. Had it been you, I should not have ex-perienced the slightest surprize; for I have more than once suspected that he loved you, particularly before we left Languedoc; but for myself, I always imagined he viewed me in the light of a girl who might have amused perhaps, but who had no likelihood of interesting him. Oh! what made him think of me, re-peated she several times in the greatest perplexity.
                  Calm your agitation my dear Fanny, cried I. Consider you are solicited, but not compelled. I have on my part long suspected that you was the object of Mr.

depart before us, and resolutely refused all their offers of assisting me.
                  She kindly placed herself next me at table; and Sir Edward, though Lady Elizabeth in a manner invited him to go to the other side by herself, contrived to seat himself on my other hand. This little mortification by no means softened the hauteur of her behaviour to me; on the contrary, from the moment she remarked Sir Edward's assiduities, her countenance betrayed a scornful displea-sure, but ill concealed under the mask of neglect and indifference.
                  As the evening advanced, I grew more engrossed with the expectation of seeing Lady Linrose; and about eight her La-dyship entered the drawing room, ac-companied by her eldest daughter.
                  I easily recollected the face that had been pointed out to me at the Opera. It's expression, however, was much changed. The sour severity of her aspect

had now entirely given place to smiles, good humour, and condescension; and though I could not wholly divert myself of the prejudice of my first prepossession, I had at least the impartiality to condemn myself for it.
                  I hope you did not wait dinner for me, Lady Mary, cried she, after the first compliments were over, for my good friend was rather indisposed, and so anxious for my stay, that I found it would have been unkind to have refused.
                  I did not expect your Ladyship, re-turned Lady Mary, and now that you are returned I ought not to regret your absence, as to that alone I owe the com-pany of another visitor, who has only fa-voured me with it because my coach was not to be had to carry her home. Pray give me leave, Miss Seymour, added she, to have the pleasure of in-troducing you to Lady Linrose.
                  I coloured at the introduction. But

Lady Linrose, with much politeness and no change of countenance, said she should be happy to have the honour of knowing me, and hoped her having the carriage had been no very material inconvenience to me.
                  Miss Dudley, however, to whom I un-derwent the same ceremony, only half bowing to my curtsey, stared me in the face with evident curiosity, and a look of supercilious ease which wholly discon-certed me.
                  She is by no means plain; but a look of conscious superiority renders her fea-tures determinedly unpleasing.
                  My accident, for which Lady Linrose testified much regret and concern, fur-nished conversation for the first quarter of an hour: but her open and unreserved affability immediately convinced me that no suspicion had arisen in her mind on hearing my name, and her manner was so totally opposite from what I expected

to have found it, that in spite of my long cherished resentment I could not avoid feeling delighted to perceive the mother of Roatsley so much more amia-ble than I had conceived possible.
                  Relieved from my alarm of being known, I flattered myself I should soon grow more composed: but ah! Sophia, remained there not yet sufficient to dis-turb and distress me? Lady Elizabeth! to meet with her, and in a party so gay, where the relations on both sides seemed met to rejoice over the approaching union which was soon to cement their friendship and intimacy by still stronger ties! Oh how sunk, dejected, and dispi-rited did I feel.
                  The company were not yet sat down to cards, but continued chatting during a short interval which succeeded to the entrance of Lady Linrose and her daugh-ter, when the door opened, and Mr. Howard, who anxious to relieve Fanny's

apprehensions, had set off in defiance of the inclemency of the evening, was an-nounced.
                  Lady Mary received him with the kindness and familiarity due to an old friend, (for I find they have been long acquainted), and congratulated him on my fa
                        â€¢
                     ety, which I give you my word, said she, you chiefly owe to me; for so eager was Miss Seymour to return home, that I was obliged to exert the authority which above forty years seniority has given me over her, to prevent her risk-ing her neck upon that horrid horse of your's, which I hope you will dispose of in all haste.
                  My joy at seeing Mr. Howard, who was equally delighted to find me so slightly hurt, drove Lady Linrose for an instant from my mind. The idea soon recurred, however, when on turning round, I perceived the alteration which his unexpected appearance had produced

on her countenance. A look of gloom, astonishment, and vexation, were there predominant; and a flush of embarrass-ment tinged her cheeks. The truth seemed at once to have flashed upon her mind. Mr. Howard, she well knew; and my name had been repeated to her so often from his lips, that no doubt could remain. She seemed for a mo-ment confounded and irresolute, but on Lady Mary's presenting Mr. Howard to her, she appeared suddenly to recollect herself and received him as an utter stranger, whom she had never before beheld, with a cold formality not untinc-tured with hauteur.
                  He on his part, finding her design was to affect ignorance, bowed with po-lite distance, and continued to chat with his usual ease to Lady Mary.
                  From the moment of his appearance, Lady Linrose kept a profound silence. She often glanced upon me an eye of

scrutiny as if by stealth, and her looks were by no means expressive of satisfac-tion: but the instant I seemed to remark her notice, she withdrew it and employed herself very busily at her knitting, which she entangled and disentangled unceas-ingly with much ingenuity.
                  Mr. Howard, in spite of the most pressing entreaties, insisted on returning home, though the evening was damp and cold. I would have given the world to have accompanied him; but finding the proposal would be received with great opposition, I prevailed on myself to say nothing, Lady Mary promising herself to accompany me to Hubert Hill in the morning.
                  After he was gone, the company di-vided into little parties. Those who preferred cards, sat down to the card ta-ble, while most of the young people seemed more inclined to chat.
                  All the gentlemen, Sir Edward and

Captain Bradshaw excepted, flocked around Lady Elizabeth's chair. They seemed indeed most zealous in their de-voirs, and attached themselves wholly to her; listening with delight to every little sally which levity drew from her lips, while she received their homage with a pride she took but little pains to conceal. Oh! my Sophia, from this severe ex-pression, are you not afraid that my un-fortunate partiality has given birth to the worst of passions, envy and injustice. Disappointment, by calling forth our powers of exertion, is generally thought to improve the heart; but I fear you will conclude my mortifications have had a very different effect on mine. Believe me, however, my dear, when I solemnly declare that those mean passions are far from having influenced me in my repre-sentation of Lady Elizabeth. Had her manners possessed that polished dignity, or her conversation that unassuming good

sense, which from the choice of Mr. Roatsley I could not but expect, be as-sured I should have admired with un-prejudiced eyes the woman of his heart: but oh! how opposite did I conceive that woman to be from what I find her. How pleased, how gratified did she not seem with the flattery and attention of the gentlemen present; who really, as far as one day's acquaintance could ena-ble me to judge, appeared uncommonly insipid in their conversation, and far from engaging in their address. But pro-bably they suffered not a little from the comparison my thoughts were continu-ally drawing between them and another, ah! how infinitely their superior.
                  Ought I not to regard this marriage as a material fault in Mr. Roatsley's charac-ter: for that his chief, if not his only aim in it is fortune, I cannot help being convinced; and is it not an unpardona-ble error to prize the advantages of splen-dour

so highly, and to hold domestic happiness in so low estimation. Yet I ought not to judge thus harshly. We know not a thousand circumstances which may render this match not only laudable but meritorious; and of Lady Elizabeth I merely form my opinion from the obser-vation of a few hours, where the little de-fects of address must be supposed wholly to have influenced my judgment. Erro-neous as this mode of conclusion may be, yet the manner so generally bespeaks the character, that where the one is informed and intelligent, the other seldom or ne-ver appears trifling or disgusting.
                  But to return to the company. Lady Linrose being engaged at whist, still pre-served towards me the cold distance she had assumed since Mr. Howard's appear-ance, and addressed herself to me no more during the remainder of the even-ing. Her eldest daughter seemed lan-guid and out of spirits, and at length

Howard's affections, and I sincerely own have secretly wished his passion that suc-cess which in my opinion it so justly me-rits. I am convinced the attachment and protection of a character like his must se-cure happiness to the woman whom he honours with his choice, provided her heart is properly disposed for feeling and answering the tenderness of his. If this is however wanting, believe me Mr. Howard himself has too much delicacy to demand the hand which prudence alone bestows on him; and I am certain pos-sesses too large a share both of good sense and modesty to be disobliged. If then you feel the least actual repugnance to this union, after having maturely weighed and considered all sides of the question, hesitate not to tell him so without co-quetry or affectation.
                  Repugnance is a strong word, said she, after a pause. We are under infinite ob-ligations to him, and he is our only friend.

took up a book, in which however she only occasionally looked, often recurring to the investigation of my figure, which appeared much the most amusing em-ployment of the two; for she examined me sometimes for minutes together with no great cordiality in her countenance, and with entire disregard to the uneasi-ness it gave me. Lady Elizabeth was soon persuaded to retire to the next apartment, where she was solicited to play on the organ, which induced almost all the company to follow her. Miss Lucy Dudley, however, seeing me dis-engaged and silent, kindly resumed her seat on a sopha; where, with Sir Edward and Mr. Bradshaw, we made a sort of distinct cotterie, and began to chat very agreeably together.
                  Lady Linrose, who appeared to re-mark with displeasure her daughter's at-tention to me, soon called her to look over her cards, and kept her by her side

the rest of the evening; and a message from the music room soon after request-ing Sir Edward to accompany on the flute Lady Elizabeth's voice in a song, unwillingly obliging him to leave the drawing room, Mr. Bradshaw and I were left in a manner tete a tete on the sopha. I found him agreeable and intelligent, attended with a certain bluntness of man-ner which rather inspired the idea of sin-cerity than rudeness, and we soon entered into a most interesting conversation.
                  Pray, said he, may I ask your opinion of Lady Elizabeth. She is universally followed and admired; yet I cannot help suspecting that her splendid fortune and brilliant prospects have contributed full as much to place her so high in the lists of beauty as any intrinsic charms she possesses; but I make no doubt you will not agree in my opinion, for I know on this subject it is impossible you should talk according to conscience.
                  
                     
Why so, said I.
                  Because it is wholly but of nature for one fine woman to give her genuine sen-timents of another.
                  Do you then imagine envy so univer-sally prevalent.
                  By no means. I only believe that the terror of such an imputation induces every handsome female to bestow upon another encomiums infinitely beyond her private opinion.
                  To prove my sincerity, said I, I will acknowledge, that Lady Elizabeth, tho' undoubtedly a fine looking woman, is less so than from report I expected to find her.
                  Had she trusted to nature, returned he, she might have merited the appella-tion you give her; but affectation and coquetry will distort the finest features, and produce awkwardness where we ought to admire grace.
                  That the friend of Mr. Roatsley should

express to a stranger, with so little re-serve, an opinion so unfavourable of the woman who was soon to be united to him, surprized me not a little, and I could only account for it by supposing that her coquetish behaviour had pro-voked him so much as to put him out of all patience and had rendered his pru-dence off its guard.
                  I thought, said I, all her little follies of that sort were soon to have a speedy conclusion.
                  Conclusion, repeated he, in a voice of undisguised displeasure; not so long as youth and good looks remain, I'll be sworn; at least if we may judge of the future by the present.
                  I thought Lady Elizabeth had been on the verge of matrimony, said I, with as much composure as I could assume, yet trembling to hear it confirmed from authority so indisputable.
                  And pray can you, Miss Seymour,

who have passed part of the winter in town, pretend to imagine that matri-mony, to a vain woman, excludes the attentions of a crowd of followers.
                  Your reproof of my ignorance is just, said I, (attempting to smile, though in-wardly depressed by an answer so unsatis-factory and evasive, and which yet ta-citly acknowledged the truth of Lady Elizabeth's engagement) but I was little in company, had few acquaintance, and spent my time chiefly at home in a very sober domestic family.
                  Yes, we could not conceive where you had hid yourself, for you were to be seen no where. It was at one time con-cluded that you must have left town.
                  That was exactly the case, returned I.
                  Not exactly, for I think you did not go till the beginning of March.
                  I could not avoid being rather sur-prised, on finding Mr. Bradshaw, with whom I had had when in town not the

slightest intercourse or acquaintance, so well informed of my motions; and read-ing my thoughts from a transient ex-pression in my countenanceâ€”you are astonished, said he, smiling, to find me so accurate in this point; but I believe you would be still more so were I to inform you how long I have had the ho-nour of considering myself intimately ac-quainted with you, though entirely with-out your knowledge or participation.
                  I must confess my surprise, cried I, laughing, and also my regret, that I should have been so fortunate without knowing it.
                  O, in regard to Miss Seymour, I give you my word I am extremely intelligent.
                  I began faintly to suspect from whence this information had been derived, and to flatter myself that it might have owed its origin to Roatsley's solicitude. This idea produced an anxiety beyond mea-sure potent, to draw some soothing par-ticulars

from his friend; but as if eager to excite a curiosity be meant not to gra-tifyâ€”perhaps, cried he, you might be no less surprized were you to know that I was in constant pursuit of you all the beginning of the winter; nay, and what is yet more wonderful and perplexing, I do not claim either merit to myself or gratitude from you, for the indefatigable pains and industry I employed in hunting after you at every place of amusement where it was probable you might appear.
                  It is very wonderful indeed, cried I, secretly delighted, nor could I ever have suspected, stranger as I found myself in this country, that I possessed any friends sufficiently interested in me to be solici-tous how or where I passed my time.
                  O, cried he with an investigating look that seemed to penetrate into what effect his words might produce, nature has been so bountifully profuse to some of her happy favorites, as to endow them

with the gift of creating friends by a coup d'oeilâ€”friends, who exist but in their sight, who live but on their smiles, and who watch with unwearied patience and assiduity, every opportunity for a meet-ing which indulgent fortune may throw in their way: friends, who develope at one glance, and adore almost in an in-stant, those virtues and excellencies which in common mortals require inti-macy, investigation, and length of time, to expand and discover themselves.
                  Vague as were these expressions, a dawning ray of hope led me to give them an interpretation so conscious, as covered me with blushes. I knew not what re-ply to make; and the earnest look with, which he evidently tried to develope my thoughts, compleated my embarrassment.
                  I am quite in the dark, cried I at length, and cannot conceive at what you aim.
                  So I perceive, said he with a satyrical

smile; but I intreat that my words may not throw you into any perplexity. I should be miserable, were your rest to-night to be disturbed from a fruitless at-tempt to unriddle my mysterious oracles.
                  I believe my rest will not be easily in-terrupted this night, replied I with a careless air, for my fatigues, or rather my alarm, has exhausted me a good deal, and I feel quite drowsy and stupid.
                  Perceiving the gravity with which I spoke, Mr. Bradshaw instantly-assumed a more reserved behaviour, and shifting the discourse to other topics, I discovered that he had not gone into the country at the time I imagined, from the private conversation I overheard, nor for some weeks after. "I was several times un-der the apprehension of recruiting orders, said he, but received a longer reprieve than I had dared flatter myself with the hopes of obtaining.
                  The card party having now concluded

their rubbers, and Lady Elizabeth, with her suite of attendants, being returned into the drawing room, a period was put to our conversation. But it left the strongest impression on my mind, and at supper I could not help secretly wishing that Mr. Bradshaw might be placed next me. In this however I was disappointed; for Sir Edward betrayed an anxiety so eager to procure a seat next mine, that the other with a grave bow gave way to him.
                  At this little manoeuvre Lady Eliza-beth appeared by no means pleased. In-deed nothing could be more pointed than the haughtiness of her manner to me the whole evening. A coquet, it would ap-pear, expects the exclusive privilege of enjoying the homage of every man who beholds her; for tho' the rest of the gen-tlemen, Mr. Bradshaw excepted, attend-ed her with the most zealous assiduity, the mortification she experienced in finding

I should be shocked to disoblige him. But he has so surprized me, that I know not what to think of the matter, nor how to collect my scattered thoughts to pon-der on the consequences. Now tell me seriously Hermione, what would you do in my case?
                  Why I will tell you sincerely, said I. Were I you, with your disposition, your gratitude to Mr. Howard, and your indif-ference to every other man, I believe I should be his wife.
                  Yet I am not the least in love with him, cried she.
                  Involuntarily I was about to reply, that being romantically in love was by all ac-counts far from an indispensible requisite towards happiness in the married state; but conscious how different my own pri-vate sentiments were from according with this opinion, I checked myself from touching on an argument that carried not conviction to my own mind, though from

this devotion was not unanimous, evi-dently hurt and corroded her. Whether the meanness of my equipage, and the humility of my abode, at the little whtie house on the hill, increased her indignation, I know not, but she regarded me with looks of contempt, and behaved to Sir Edward with so much childish ill hu-mour, that I began at length to suspect some secret partiality must have produced a conduct for which mere selfish vanity seemed an inadequate cause.
                  This sullen behaviour of Lady Eliza-beth, the cold distance of Lady Linrose, and the imperious disregard of her eldest daughter, added to my being conscious how disagreeable my presence, tho' from very different motives, must prove to them all, made me feel beyond measure uncomfortable; and the painful weight which lay heavy at my heart, and wholly depressed my spirits, made Sir Edward's conversation not merely unpleasant but

irksome to me; especially as my suspi-cion of Lady Elizabeth's attachment was strengthened and confirmed every instant by her increasing uneasiness. When I considered however how inferior Sir Ed-ward was in all points to his competitor, it was not possible for me to conceive that caprice, or folly itself, could be blind to the striking difference between them.
                  The cordial intimacy that subsisted be-tween the two families, and indeed in-cluded all present but myself, not only ex-cluded me from all share of the conver-sation, which I was far from regretting, but made me feel awkward, as well as miserable. Lady Mary indeed often ad-dressed herself to me with peculiar civili-ty; but as I was placed at a distance from her, politeness did not compensate for the rude neglect of her niece.
                  The conversation happening to turn on resemblances, I think, said Sir Edward, I never beheld a more striking likeness

than the profiles of Miss Lucy Dudley and Miss Seymour exhibit at this mo-ment. I have been considering them on each side of me for some time, with al-most an equal mixture of wonder and admiration.
                  A likeness! repeated Miss Dudley. I must acknowledge I scarce ever beheld two faces in my opinion more opposite.
                  I am extremely sorry to differ from you, Madam, returned he; but I still dare ap-peal to the company if my remark is not just.
                  Strikingly so indeed, cried Lady Ma-ry; tho' till it was mentioned I own I was not sensible of the resemblance. But in spite of the difference of complex-ion it is really remarkable. Don't your Ladyship think so, added she, turning to Lady Linrose?
                  I must confess, returned her Ladyship, with a cold, embarrassed air, I am of

Caroline's opinion: I cannot perceive the likeness.
                  Good heavens! cried Caroline, how should there be any. The eyes of the one are black, and Lucy's are quite blue.
                  I did not speak of the eyes of the two ladies, but of their profiles, said Sir Ed-ward. There is even somewhat in the ex-pression of countenance so much alike, that had I never before been in company with either, I should have concluded them nearly related.
                  What effect these words produced in the countenances of Lady Linrose and her daughters, I had not resolution to examine, and conscious confusion made me keep my eyes fixed on the table; from which however I soon raised them in astonishment on hearing Lady Linrose say, you pay my daughter a very unme-rited compliment by the comparison, Sir Edward, and really now you put it into my head, I don't know but there is some

sort of likeness, especially in the under part of the face: and soon after, when we were separating for the night, her La-dyship wished me a good night with par-ticular civility and affability.
                  Confounded with the various events of the day, the moment I found myself a-lone in the chamber allotted me, I threw myself into a chair, and gave way to a train of reflections, which so wholly over-powered me, as to banish all desire of sleep. I could not but admire the singu-larity of that chance, which had conduc-ted me so strangely into the midst of my relations, and to the party which of all others I wished the most to avoid; while I knew that my presence, by overwhelm-ing them with confusion and embarrass-ment, must prove still more disagreeable to them than to myself. Lady Elizabeth tooâ€”to feel all my half-suppressed emo-tions animated and renewed by this un-expected

and unwished for rencontre, ah! Sophia! don't you pity me?
                  After passing a very restless night, I found my foot so much worse, that walking even into the next room was al-most impracticable. I therefore sent a message to Lady Mary by her maid, who assisted me to dress, intimating that if her Ladyship would give me leave, I should breakfast in my own apartment, where I wished to remain till the carriage was ordered to carry me home. By this means I avoided seeing any of the com-pany, whom I really dreaded encounter-ing at breakfast, after the perturbation of the preceding day. I regretted how-ever, that in escaping from the others, I must be deprived of seeing Mr. Brad-shaw, whose mysterious discourse it must be owned astonished though it did not perplex me, and formed no inconsidera-ble portion of my reflexions during the night.
                  
                     
Lady Mary entered my chamber soon after, and made a thousand kind enqui-ries respecting my health. She informed me that Lady Linrose was confined to bed with a headach, and that Mr. Brad-shaw had set off for his quarters two hours before breakfast: and after kindly disapproving of my imprudence in ven-turing home, told me, since I was deter-mined to go, she should herself see me safe to Hubert Hill, as she wished to take the earliest opportunity of waiting on Mrs. Howard.
                  Miss Lucy Dudley was likewise so obliging as to pay me a visit before I left Holtenham. While she sat with me in my chamber, Lady Mary again entered. I think an airing will be of service to you, my dear, said she to her, after your late confinement. Pray will you accom-pany me to Mrs. Howard's. Her hus-band is an old friend of mine, and I pos-sess few or none I respect so highly.
                  
                     
With all my heart, my dear Madam, cried she; and having sent the maid for her hat, we immediately proceeded down stairs, which was to me a very difficult undertaking and one that I did not ac-complish without great pain, though I had an assistant on each hand.
                  When we entered the hall, we were met by Lady Elizabeth and Miss Dud-ley. The former, with a reluctant bow, hoped I was well: and the other, with-out even vouchsafing me that civility, hastily called outâ€”Lucy, where are you going?
                  I mean to accompany Lady Mary and Miss Seymour. The day is fine, and an airing will be agreeable.
                  I believe Mamma will not allow of your going, sister.
                  Why so.
                  Nay, I shall go ask her: and instantly returning, saidâ€”Mamma does not chuse

you should risk taking cold by airing to-day Lucy.
                  Lord how odd, when it is the sweetest weather in the world.
                  O there is no chance of cold in such a morning, cried Lady Mary. It will do her good I'm convinced.
                  It is Mamma's commands, said Miss Caroline gravely; and although the sweet Lucy went herself to solicit, she came back disappointed. I am very sorry, said she, taking my hand, that I cannot have the pleasure of your company a lit-tle longer; but I hope Lady Mary will visit at Hubert Hill more than once while we remain at Holtenham, and I shall most assuredly be of the party next time.
                  Lady Linrose, you perceive, adheres with conscientious integrity to her pro-mise of debarring all intercourse between her family and ours. Angry as I am, there is somewhat in her manners so insi-nuating,

that I cannot so cordially blame her conduct as I did before I saw her: nay what is still more strange, I cannot avoid suggesting excuses for her beha-viour; and even feel somewhat soothing and consolatory in the idea that Roatsley's mother, whom I desire so much to love and respect, seems more worthy of these sentiments than I ever imagined she could prove. Her son resembles her extremely, though the expression is different.
                  I believe, Sophia, prejudice and par-tiality blind the eye of judgment so un-accountably, that people are seldom to be trusted in their prepossessions where a strong and lively interest is at stake. Per-haps we have judged too hardly of this family. To oppose Lord Belmont in a favourite point, may be to relinquish all hopes of his favour for ever; and if such is the inflexibility of his temper Lady Linrose is not so much to blame.
                  Fanny was much relieved by my re-turn

my knowledge of Fanny's temper it might have been not improperly offered to her, and only added, that her own feelings must direct her.
                  We were interrupted by Mrs. Hindon, who came to inform us that the carriage waited to carry us to afternoon prayers. I believe poor Fanny's devotions were not a little disturbed; and on our return I observed she met the eyes of Mr. How-ard with a confusion which seemed to forebode no great severity.
                  I had evidently shewn on which side my suffrage rested; but I cautiously withheld any advice likely to prejudice her mind, which tho' diffident and fear-ful, appeared neither averse nor deter-mined.
                  
                     Adieu. H. SEYMOUR.
                  
               
            
            
               

though I looked miserably ill. My foot was painful, and my mind in agita-tion; and the instant Lady Mary left us, I was put to bed, where however I did not sleep, but enjoyed a more soothing relief in relating to my sister all the cir-cumstances of my disagreeable adventure.
                  
                     H. SEYMOUR.
                  
               
            
            
               LETTER XVII. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     JUNE 6.
                  
               
               AS my sprain still confines me to the sopha, and my journal is always my fa-vourite amusement, I have employed the two last days almost constantly in writing. Indeed I am happy to fly to

any occupation that has the power of di-viding my thoughts: for my Sophia will easily conceive the late incident was but ill calculated for destroying that fatal im-pression, which I flattered myself time and absence, assisted by my most vigor-ous exertions, would at length subdue. Would to heaven the marriage was once finally concluded. When doubt (absurd as it is to doubt) is converted into cer-tainty, my endeavours I am convinced must be successful. I may suffer at first, but these turbulent feelings will abate. At present a thousand circumstances are ever ready to occur to rouse and animate an attachment alas! too insinuating.
               How can I account for Roatsley's con-duct, hinted to me by his friend. Oh! my dear, was it indeed Roatsley who oc-casioned Mr. Bradshaw's researches? why then his silence to Mr. Howard's letter; and why, with engagements so serious on his hands, could he allow in

himself a solicitude so fruitless? His con-duct altogether is inexplicable, and the more I attempt to unravel it, the less my conjectures give me satisfaction.
               Are you not astonished, my love, at my representation of Lady Elizabeth Sid-ley. Is it possible to believe Roatsley can make such a sacrifice to fortune. Oh! Sophia! a sacrifice to principle I am convinced it must be. Duty and per-suasion have prevailed with him to ac-quiesce in a match on which his family have set their hearts.
               
                  
                     
                        JUNE 10.
                     
                  
                  I have been visited during my confine-ment by the good parson's family, who spent yesterday with us.
                  Mrs. Heathcote, though unacquainted but by report with Lady Mary Lawrence, told us a thousand little country anec-dotes

of her, which all proved the good-ness of her heart and the liberality of her ample purse; for she is possessed of a splendid income, having been left by her late husband the sole disposal of his fortune. This fortune, Mrs. Heathcote said, it was generally supposed would center in her neice, Lady Elizabeth Sed-ley, who was not much beloved by the ladies in the neighbourhood, as she uni-formly behaved to them with a conscious superiority, and imperious reserve, that rendered her company formal and dis-gusting. Indeed, said she, her Ladyship, I am told, exacts a deference and atten-tion that few are willing to pay; for which reason there is usually a party at Holtenham of people of the first rank and importance from town, with whom alone Lady Elizabeth will associate on a footing of equality.
                  I ventured to enquire, finding the good woman both intelligent and communi-cative,

whether or not Lord Linrose pos-sessed any property in this part of the country. She believed not, she told me: but since Mr. Howard had left England, above one half of the estates around had changed their original proprietors; and my Lord Belmont had lately made two different purchases of considerable amount, which had secured to him a decided par-liamentary interest in the county. On one of these estates, said she, to which he has given the name of Mount Dudley, and which is not above seven miles dis-tant, he has built a very elegant though not a very large house, and has presented it to his favourite grand son Mr. Roats-ley, who however has never lived in it as it has not yet been put in order for a family: but I understand they are fitting it up in all haste, and furnishing it very magnificiently for his place of residence so soon as his marriage is concluded: so

you will have them for neighbours pre-sently.
                  Is that event soon to take place, de-manded Fanny.
                  Indeed, Madam, nobody seems to know. It has been long talked of; and before Mr. Roatsley set out on his tra-vels, every one said it would happen di-rectly on his return. But it has been whispered since his return, that matters are not in such forwardness as was ima-gined. The young man's ardour is sus-pected to be cooled; nay some people say it never was extremely violent; but that when he was very young, and the lady hardly fifteen, there subsisted a childish attachment between them, which originated entirely on the side of Lady Elizabeth; and that Lord Belmont, who has been unfortunate in some of his fa-mily, particularly in the article of ma-trimony, and who was not easily recon-ciled to the present Lord Linrose on his

marriage, although by the death of a dlstant relation her Ladyship has brought him a very considerable fortune, exacted a promise, and promoted an engagement between his grandson and this lady, which is intended to be concluded on his Lordship's return from the Continent.
                  Lady Elizabeth is much to be pitied, in my opinion, cried Fanny, if with all her splendid advantages of birth and fortune they cannot secure the heart of the man she has chosen.
                  I agree with you perfectly, Madam: But I believe ladies of superior rank and education don't always think in that man-ner; and by what I hear, Lady Eliza-beth is not much calculated for domestic happiness.
                  Conscious of my secret anxiety, I for-bore, while Mr. Howard and the rest of the company were present, to prolong the subject: but finding my self acciden-tally alone with Mrs. Heathcote, for a

quarter of an hour after dinner, I artfully renewed the topic of Lady Elizabeth; and she then told me she was intimately connected with the gentlewoman who had superintended her education as go-verness, from whence she had drawn the early part of her information. Mr. Roats-ley, said she, has been I know acquainted with the young lady from infancy. She was his sister's friend, and had often been his own playfellow. It is not improbable therefore that her infantine attachment had produced in him a return of affection before he went abroad that might par-take more of gratitude than passion. It must be owned Lady Elizabeth has but ill answered the fond expectations of her family; and probably he finds himself disappointed, after several years absence. But there is no trusting to report. It is very certain however that he has not once visited at Holtenham since his arri-val; though, owing to Lady Mary's in-disposition,

the family only passed a very few weeks this winter in town. They say Lady Elizabeth is much offended at the coolness of his assiduities, and that there is a very formidable rival, Sir Ed-ward Sudbury, in the way, who is much in favour with her Ladyship at present, but I dare say there is nothing in it.
                  All this accounts a little, Sophia, for Captain Bradshaw's insinuations.

                  To-day I have ventured to take a short walk, and am considerably better. We have had compliments of enquiry from Lady Mary after my health more than once.
                  We have been rather uneasy at not hearing from our dear, dear Lady Au-brey all this while; and we now find we have had but too much reason for appre-hension:

alas! she has had a relapse; but thank God not an alarming one. She is now, she tells us, in the kindest of letters which we received this morn-ing, quite recovered, and has got Sir William and Lady Meredith with her at the castle. I find myself settled here, says she, much to my satisfaction. The ancient architecture of my abode has nei-ther banished light, nor precluded cheer-fulness; and I am determined its gran-deur shall on no account be fettered with state or parade. My mind begins to partake of the tranquility around me; and I am enabled myself to taste that comfort which an overgrown and other-wise useless fortune allows me the privi-lege of dispensing to others. But when shall my rising satisfaction receive its full completion in the dear society of my be-loved children? when shall I again fold them to my heart, and receive, in tears of heartfelt pleasure, a compensation for

                     FEB. 22.
                  
               
               WELL, my dear Sophia, after dis-appointments so severe, and prospects so chearless and dreary, the scene begins to brighten. Fanny has at last yielded in Mr. Howard's favour, and finds herself perfectly satisfied and at ease now that her future fate seems determined.
               Mr. Howard appears delighted with his good fortune, tho' a propriety of feeling peculiar to himself deters him from testifying it in a manner too pointed. An admirer after forty must not, as he justly observed, adopt the behaviour of one twenty years younger. There is a

those of bitterness and misery which have flowed with such profusion from my eyes? I will not however soften your feeling hearts into a hasty compliance with my wishes, which may not prove, just at this time, wholly convenient to the wor-thy Mr. Howard. I will trust to your affection to expedite your visit as soon as you can, and till I enjoy the happiness of seeing you, do not fear that I am either solitary or desponding; no, on the con-trary, be assured I am grateful, con-tented, and happy. I have at present the pleasure of Sir William and my dear aunt's company, who will not leave me for some time. My doors are never shut against those in my neighbourhood who favour me with their visits, without exacting a scrupulous return; and my mind is at ease while I rest assured of the love and attachment of those clear and amiable children who are so entirely pos-sessed of mine.
                  
                     
Dear and ever valued Lady Aubrey! With what delight shall we fulfil our promise. Mr. Howard's business will detain him a fortnight longer: but I have written that if any more delays in-tervene, and my sister continues well, I shall undoubtedly make the journey by myself.

               LETTER XVIII. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     JUNE 15.
                  
               
               I WILL not anticipate, Sophia. But why is fortune so industrious in throwing accidents in my way which prove the ut-most exertion of my resolution.
               
                  
Yesterday Miss Patty Heathcote walk-ed up in the morning, to inform us that a set of stroling players had lately ar-rived in the little village near us; that they had fitted up their theatre in a barn, where for some preceding evenings they had performed some of the best plays, much to the satisfaction, said she inno-cently, of very excellent judges; and that as neither she nor her mother had ever seen a play, they would take it as a pro-digious favour indeed if Mr. and Mrs. Howard and I would do them the ho-nour to go and make a party with them.
               The little girl's eyes, while she deli-vered this message, sparkled with an ea-gerness which persuaded Mr. Howard at once to agree to the measure, and made me really anxious for its success; and Fanny, who with the sedate character of a sober married woman preserves all the innocent eagerness of seventeen, is al-ways

so much delighted with any frolic, that she was desirous of going the instant it was proposed.
               As the village is scarce a mile and an half distant, and it was bright moon light, it was agreed that the whole party should walk to and from the theatre, concluding that the performance would not detain us very late; myself excepted, whom Mr. Howard insisted on carrying thither in his little equipage, as walking, after my late accident, might prove hurtful, my foot, though almost well, being still weak. Miss Patty ran full speed down the hill, breathless with ex-pectation to equip herself for the play-house, and to request that her father and mother and all the children old enough to accompany them, would assemble at Hubert Hill to dinner, from whence we should all set off together.
               The labours of the toilet are little known in the rural world; and Nature

has so lavishly decked this happy inno-cent family with rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, and smiling countenances, that they are as unnecessary as unknown. An hour after, we beheld the good par-son and his wife ascending the hill, fol-lowed by five of their children; and no masked ball or birth night assembly ever occasioned more entertainment and de-light than did this excursion to our rustic theatre.
               We set off at half past four, for the children would not cease teizing us till we were on foot; and having arrived a full hour too soon, took possession of the front bench, which in this play house might be denominated the stage boxes, being the most convenient place in the barn for seeing the performance.
               We had not been long seated, before several gentlemen entered, the most of whom by their dress appeared to be officers. Miss Patty informed me they

belonged to a company at present quar-tered in the village; but as the place was but indifferently lighted up it was not easy immediately to distinguish their faces.
               They had not engaged my attention above a few moments, when my com-panion, Miss Patty, asked me in a whis-per if I did not think that gentleman in the dark coloured coat, the handsomest young man I had ever seen; and turning to where she pointed, I beheld Mr. Roats-ley leaning against one of the side scenes, engaged in conversation with some gen-tlemen.
               You may easily imagine I was in a tre-mor; and I had not an instant given me to compose or recollect myself, when I perceived Mr. Bradshaw approach him, and gently pulling him by the arm, whis-per something in his ear, which made him at once change colour and glance his eyes with eagerness around the house.

Captain Bradshaw just then made me a respectful bow; and his friend taking the reference of his look, instantly followed his example, with an expression in his countenance of satisfaction and delight which I fear almost conveyed equal plea-sure into mine. He came directly up to me, and paid me his compliments with a politeness not however unmixed with confusion; while on my part, the recollection of Mrs. Hindon's letter, the obligation for which my avowed acknow-ledgements were due, and the secret hu-miliating benefit I knew he had intended to bestow, threw an awkwardness and constraint over my reception of him which I could not for some time either conquer or conceal.
               Happily Mr. Howard immediately joined us; and by addressing himself to Roatsley, gave me a momentary relief. Perceiving I seemed at a loss, he partly comprehended the cause; and kindly

paved the way for my acknowledgments by entering at once on the subject. I did myself the pleasure of writing to you, Mr. Roatsley, said he, some time ago, but as I have not been favoured with an answerâ€”
               I should not have failed most certainly in seizing the earliest opportunity of ac-knowledging any letter of your's, returned he, had I been conscious of the favour; but I have been making a little excursion of late, and having no fixed abode, I sup-pose they knew not where to forward my letters, as I was so negligent as to leave no orders about them.
               Nay, Sir, had you really been guilty of any omission, no apology was necessary to me: for I acted but as amanuensis to my fair sister: and my letter was only intended to express her acknowledgments added to my own, for the polite attention with which you have interested yourself in her affairs.
               
                  
A deep blush overspread the counte-nance of Mr. Roatsley at this speech, and an embarrassment took possession of his features little inferior to my own when I added, that he must have con-cluded me extremely ungrateful to have so long deferred returning my very sin-cere thanks, for an obligation which should always induce me to consider my-self as particularly indebted to him.
               His confusion was now augmented; and bowing, he stammered not a little while he repeatedâ€”what pleasure he must receiveâ€”how delighted he must beâ€”and how happy he should think him-self to be of the smallest service to Miss Seymour.
               He then turned to address himself to Mr. Bradshaw as if anxious to change the subject; and just at that instant per-ceiving my sister, for whom he had not even enquired, he left me to pay his compliments to her; but soon returning,

he entered immediately on a new topic, enquired how I had amused myself in the country during the winter, asked if I could really leave town at that gay sea-son without the slightest regret, and placed himself next me, where there happened fortunately to be a vacant seat. His l
                     â€¢
                  te confusion now gave way to a gaiety and animation which convinced me that the ceremony of distant and oc-casional meetings had not hitherto al-lowed of that easy intimacy between us which developes without constraint or disguise the real temper of mind. My conscious feelings had always thrown a reserve over my own manner to Mr. Roatsley, which could not fail to affect his; but the unexpected satisfaction of this sudden rencontre had given to both a flow of spirits that would not be re-strained, and which while it wholly ba-nished Lady Elizabeth Sedley from my recollection presented Roatsley in a point

dignity suited to that period, which even love, all-powerful love, must not entirely discard. He possesses all the tenderness, while he has exploded the flights of a lover; and Fanny, who imagined that courtship must be serious, aweful and for-mal, and that she should find an unusual embarrassment attend her new situation, is charmed to perceive that Mr. Howard is exactly what he was before, and that she is if possible still more at ease with him than formerly.
               This is rendered more practicable, as they have taken the precaution of keep-ing the present posture of affairs a pro-found secret from this family; nor do they intend informing them how matters are likely to be concluded till it is un-necessary any longer to retain them in ignorance. Indeed Mrs. Hindon's entire disregard of delicacy, added to her pas-sion for raillery, makes her the last per-son

of view entirely new and still more insi-nuating. I had before admired him as a character of real and unassuming dignity. The amiable softness of his address had charmed me; and all I saw, and all I heard of his disposition, (however com-bated at times by pique and displeasure) had served but to augment my esteem. I had considered him as rather of a grave turn of mind: this evening however, the early part of it at least, fully satisfied me of my error. He was not merely in good spirits, but lively and animated beyond measure, and his friend Captain Brad-shaw, who joined us, and who really is a very agreeable young man, added to the gaiety and life of the party.
               The commencement of the play, which by the way was King Lear, put a period for a short time to this general chat. But the performance was so miserable, that it was impossible to pay attention to it, and Mr. Roatsley again addressed himself in

conversation to me. He soon recurred to my leaving town, and talked of it with the most flattering regret. I shall not do you the injustice to suppose, said he, that possessing in yourself those never failing resources which give defiance to vapours and ennui, you could either en-dure much regret on leaving the mere amusements of the town, or suffer from vacancy or languor on returning to the country; but early in March, every thing around is so bleak, and the com-munication between one neighbour and another so often impeded by bad roads or bad weather, that a comfortable, agreeable society, in which (after all our various ways of pursuing pleasure), it must be confessed our first enjoyment consists, is less practicable in the country than in town; besides most people are of that opinion, and the country of course must have been quite deserted when you arrived in it.
               
                  
Yes, answered I; but when I retired to Hubert Hill I was so singularly situa-ted as to carry along with me the only friends to whom, at least in this part of the world, I can lay claim, and they were such as must have enlivened and en-deared the most dismal and uncomforta-ble spot.
               After such a declaration, I must not presume to enquire of whom this enviable party consisted.
               You safely may, said I, since my bro-ther and sister constituted the whole.
               And is your heart, Miss Seymour, so entirely engrossed by these friends, amia-ble and deserving as they are, that no place is left in it for the numbers who must have mourned your absence.
               When I left London, said I with a sudden warmth, which the recollection of our forlorn situation forcibly excited, it contained not one human soul, who, had they been certain they should have

beheld me no more, would have endured one moment's regret.
               The idea was so melancholy, that a tear started into my eye, not I'm afraid unseen by Roatsley, for he instantly re-pliedâ€”Ah! Miss Seymour, that is wholly and utterly impossible. Those who are formed by nature for charming their own sex and enchanting our's, cannot fail of converting into friends and admirers all blest with the happiness of their acquaint-ance.
               This compliment, pronounced in a voice of mixed eagernese and softness, could not fail to confuse me: and unable to make a proper reply, or to disclaim a compliment much too flattering even for acknowledgement, I could only reply with much hesitationâ€”oh! Mr. Roatsley, how can you possibly imagineâ€”besides you know I am quite a stranger in Eng-land.
               Loveliness, continued he in the same

strain, is an object too interesting to man-kind in general to prove a stranger in any quarter of the globe. Where there are souls to feel its influence, it must be felt with force and energy irresistible.
               To this an answer was still more im-possible and I did not attempt it. Find-ing I was silentâ€”I have the pleasure of considering myself, said he, after a pause, as your first English acquaintance. Will you not then allow me the inexpressible happiness of a place in this envied list of your friends. Be assured I shall yield to none in the interest. I hold in your wel-fare.
               The warmth of his expressions, and still more the eagerness of his counte-nance, covered me with blushes, and I could only reply by a slight bow of ac-knowledgement. I took courage at length to add, that the obligations I owed him sufficiently proved his claim to be considered in that light.
               
                  
This conversation naturally led him, with a gaiety that soon banished my con-scious confusion, to mention the circum-stances of our first meeting, from which, by an easy transition, he proceeded to talk upon many interesting topicks. In the course of this discourse, I was not a little surprized to hear him mention Lord Belmont's name more than once with the most unconscious ingenuousness, and found myself still more bewildered when I perceived he seemed even desir-ous of drawing from me every circum-stance relating to my situation abroad that he could contrive, without an ap-pearance of impertinent curiosity, to ob-tain.
               Various were the particulars into which he had the address, though with the ut-most politeness, to penetrate. I was asto-nished and confounded by his behaviour, yet I still remained convinced that his ig-norance was feigned: and while I an-swered

simply and naturally to all his en-quiries, pride made me disdain to force him to an explanation, which must de-tect his duplicity, and cover him with confusion.
               At lengthâ€”your accent is so little defective Miss Seymour, said he, that it is difficult for me to believe you never were in England till now.
               I left it when so very young, replied I, that I have not the most distant re-collection of ever having been in it.
               Having quitted it so very early, is equivalent to your never having been in it. But I always understood, Miss Sey-mour, that France had had the honour of your birth.
               Astonished, and entirely off my guard at this speech, I involuntarily exclaimed â€”good heavens! Mr. Roatsley, how can you say so? Is it possible you can affect this ignorance.
               Ignorance! repeated he. Little as I

have had the happiness of enjoying your company, and short as has been the pe-riod of our acquaintance, it is not sur-prizing that I should be ignorant of this as well as of a thousand other circum-stances into which I have never had the presumption to enquire, however anxious my desire of information has been.
               Are you indeed serious, cried I; for inexplicable as it appeared, I now per-ceived that all was as yet a secret to him.
               Never more so than at this moment. But why should it astonish you so much? is it not the natural consequence ofâ€”
               Because, cried I, interrupting him, I have believed till this instant that you were as perfectly well informed of every circumstance of my birth and education as the most intimate of my friends can 
                     â€¢
                  e, or as I myself am.
               My ignorance, be assured, answered he, has resulted neither from want of anxiety nor want of exertion to obtain

information; but simply that from your recent arrival in this country your circle of acquaintance was not extensive, and none seemed more in the secret than myself. Miss Seymour cannot suppose that where she appeared she could re-main disregarded and unnoticed. Vari-ous were the accounts relating to her that reached my ears; but they were uniformly vague and unsatisfactory, and I am convinced void of foundation. Since however the fate of my enquiries ap-pears to you so extraordinary, I hope you will not think my earnest request of an explanation too presuming. Under the happy title just now granted me may I dare to venture on such a demand?
               Amazement, satisfaction, and a variety of other emotions, at once so powerfully assailed me, that for a few moments I could not articulate; and grew so sud-denly pale, that Roatsley hastily applied to Miss Patty for her smelling bottle;

who, extremely frightened, was about to have alarmed my sister, and the rest of the party, had I not recollected myself, and assured her my indisposition was slight and already gone off. To any other person my countenance might have discovered that my spirits were more af-fected than my health; but engrossed with the novelty of the performance, which had now advanced to the begin-ning of the second act, my young com-panion had not given the slightest atten-tion to our conversation, and having been often told I suppose that fine ladies were vapourish and hysterical, did not seem either suspicious or surprised.
               Far otherwise were the conclusions of Mr. Roatsley. Shocked and confounded, he began to apprehend a mystery, to un-ravel which he had not received the slightest hint or assistance. I am in the agonies of the most painful suspense, said he after a pause: but since the subject is

with whom one would incline to in-trust a subject of this nature.
               Mr. Howard is extremely urgent with Fanny to have the ceremony which is to unite them as soon as possible performed; and as a thousand reasons conspire to make us wish ourselves no longer a burthen on the constrained civilities of Mrs. Hindon, Fanny has promised that after the usual forms of law are concluded, she shall not invent unnecessary delays.
               Since my last Mrs. Hindon has more than once renewed her favorite topic. It is not without infinite reluctance that she relinquishes any plan to which in her own mind she has attached an importance. Lady Farnford however seems to have given up all hope; and her son, I under-stand from Miss Parsons, has been twice refused admittance at Mrs. Hindon's door, in pursuance no doubt of his mo-ther's request to her friend to give no countenance or encouragement to a pas-sion,

so distressing, I am contented nay even eager to remain in ignorance.
               You shall be informed of every thing you may desire to know, said I, when I found myself a little recovered; but at present all explanation is impossible. A few words will not suffice; and even if they should, I am incapable myself of entering on the subject.
               From whom then, will you allow me to expect it?
               From my brother, Mr. Howard. He will tell you all.
               
                  All! repeated he, still more con-founded. The solemnity of the phrase almost alarms me.
               The entrance of a large party of gen-tlemen and ladies just at this instant cre-ated a noise and bustle which carried our eyes to the door. Good God! ex-claimed Roatsley in a tone of vexa-tion; and I instantly discovered Lady Marry Lawrance, her niece Lady Eliza-beth,

Miss Dudley, and in short the whole party at Holtenham, (Lady Lin-rose and Miss Lucy Dudley excepted) escorted by Sir Edward Sudbury and se-veral other young men.
               As we had taken possession of the front bench, seats for so many people occa-sioned some confusion. That on which we were placed could not contain above one half of the ladies, it being already more than half filled; and though the one behind was almost empty, having been purposely kept for the more fashion-able part of the audience, they seemed to disdain occupying it, and stood some time very civilly expressing their disap-pointment aloud with the expectation that our party would rise and give them place.
               This act of politeness, however, we had no sort of intention of performing. Indeed, for myself, the haughty pre-sumption of their behaviour would have

deterred me from taking any steps to-wards their accommodation; but at pre-sent the unexpected appearance of Lady Elizabeth, who for an hour before had not once obtruded on my mind, now wholly banished that pleasing satisfac-faction and inward complacency which the knowledge that Roatsley had not yet deserted us diffused over my feelings. I was sunk and dispirited, and not in the least disposed to be civil and attentive to any of this fashionable set, Lady Mary excepted, who came up to my sister, and addressed us with her usual good breeding and affability.
               Miss Dudley, a few minutes after she entered, perceiving her brother, who had risen to pay his respects to the ladies, immediately called outâ€”Lord brother, when did you arrive in this part of the world?
               Only last night, returned he. I came to spend a few days with Bradshaw at his

quarters, and he brought me hither for the purpose of encouraging these poor people. I did not expect to find so much good company, nor to meet with so many of my friends.
               Nay, answered she, we never should have thought of coming to this poor lit-tle place, which must be a sad, stupid affair, but it seems the man who dig-nifies himself with the title of manager prayed Lady Mary so hard to patronize them, that out of mere compassion she bespoke the play, and insisted we should all attend her.
               Lady Elizabeth just then advancing, exclaimed in a tone of impatience loud enough to be heard all over the houseâ€” Lard, only think of these people having taken our places; and presently per-ceiving meâ€”how do you do, Miss Sey-mour? cried she with a careless air; and without waiting a reply, continued in my

hearing to express her wonder, what the people could mean.
               
               Her harangue was all at once inter-rupted by the unexpected sight of Mr. Roatsley, who came forward to pay her his compliments. I watched what ef-fect this sudden meeting might produce in the countenances of both, and re-marked that they mutually reddened ex-tremely at the rencontre; but while Roatsley addressed himself to her with a respectful but distant air, her manner to him appeared to betray an over acted display of dignity and reserve. She re-covered her little embarrassment very speedily however; for she immediately recurred to her scornful expressions of surprise, and repeated her complaints to him, who politely offered her the place he had just quitted by me.
               No, cried she carelessly, I can't be di-vided from my party.
               
                  
Had your Ladyship engaged places? said he.
               O Lord, no. How should one think of such a thing in such a place as this. But when the people came to solicit us to go, they told us the first bench should be reserved for any people of fashion who might take it into their heads to come, and behold all the parsons wives and daughters I believe in the county have assembled to take possession of the only tolerable places in the barn.
               Roatsley looked by no means pleased at this rude speech, which he knew I could not but overhear, and replied with quicknessâ€”But as your Ladyship can't suppose any of the ladies will give up their seats, I would advise you to accept of mine.
               Mr. Howard and the good Doctor having by this time risen to accommo-date the company, and placed some of the children behind, room was at length

made for them; and by this arrange-ment Roatsley was once more placed next me with Lady Elizabeth on his other hand.
               Her Ladyship chose not to favour me with any further notice during the re-mainder of the evening; and Miss Dud-ley, who did not even afford me the ci-vility of a distant bow, sat with her eyes fixed on the spot where her brother was placed, whom she examined with an as-pect of such ill humour and displeasure, every time he addressed himself to me, that I felt beyond measure uneasy.
               She had not the smallest reason, how-ever, to dread or even to suspect any assi-duity on his part towards me; for his behaviour was now totally changed. He looked grave, thoughtful, and absorbed. The little he said was forced and con-strainedâ–ª and his attentions were divided with the most scrupulous exactness equally between Lady Elizabeth and myself.
               
                  
Her admirer, or rather her attendant, Sir Edward, under pretence of avoiding to crowd her, insisted on relinquishing a place her Ladyship had procured him immediately behind her, and teized me not a little, (for it must be owned I was not in the best humour) by standing at my side with his usual solicitude, and en-tering into conversation with me. I was less than ever in a mood for listening to him, particularly as I observed that Roatsley lent an attentive 
                     â€¢
                  ar to all that passed between us; the purport of which consisted in much anxiety in regard to my accident, and at length in an explicit but diffident request that I would allow him the honour of visiting me at Hubert Hill, and would favour him with an in-troduction to Mr. Howard, whom he said he had never been so fortunate as to meet at Mrs. Hindon's.
               The recollection of his behaviour on a certain occasion, rendered a refusal, or

even an evasion of this demand, impossi-ble, though the unbounded satisfaction he testified on my compliance, made me speedily apprehend that I ought not to have consented, and induced me to fear I had granted more than I designed by the introduction.
               He and Mr. Roatsley seemed inti-mately acquainted. Between the acts they joined each other, and continued in earnest conversation; and from the gra-vity of the one countenance and the too apparent exultation of the other, I could not avoid suspecting that Sir Edward was confessing his sanguine expectations to his friend. You smile at my vanity, Sophia; but the attentions of this young man are so pointed and undisguised, that they attract universal observation where-ever I meet him; though my manner (uniformly as reserved as good breeding will allow it to be) testifies as plainly as

words almost could do, how little I am gratified by his notice.
               Lady Elizabeth, deprived of the de-voirs of one admirer, and not much soothed by the cold politeness of another, lavished all her smiles, good humour, and condescension, upon a young man of a very singular appearance, who sat on her left hand, and who seemed so entirely to atone for the neglect of the others, that I perceived her supposed partiality to Sir Edward was merely the indiscriminate love of flattery and admi-ration. Her present lover (for such his assiduities evidently confessed him to be) I was informed possessed a splendid for-tune, and was of distinguished rank, but his name I have forgot. He was dressed in the stile of a common groom or horse jockey, and his hair, cut short behind, hung about his ears with a negligence which betrayed not only disrespect for the company, but a total disregard both

now deprived of all the ostentatious advantages that once rendered it so de-sirable.
               Captain Wilmot appears to bear his disappointment with an admirable good grace; though the frigid hauteur with which Fanny behaved to him the even-ing they met, by discovering the uncon-cern of her heart, and opening his eyes to the falsity of his self-sufficient security of her affections, must have proved very little gratifying to the all-potent vanity of his character. He has taken care to be constantly engaged ever since, except one morning, when he found courage to step in for ten minutes. Fanny was a-bove stairs when he entered; but fol-lowed him a short time after into the parlour. He blushed extremely, and appeared much embarrassed on paying her the usual compliments; nor did his awkwardness seem less conspicuous from an air of forced gayety with which he en-deavoured

of cleanliness and propriety; yet an air of conscious consequence, and a very handsome figure, which he tried in vain to disguise, betrayed his latent impor-tance. He seemed possessed of exuber-ant spirits; for his Lordship and Lady Elizabeth, by their talking and laughing, gave great offence and occasioned much disturbance to the rustic part of the au-dience, who were not so refined as to despise the performance, but on the con-trary enjoyed it with all the relish of novelty.
               The actors indeed were so miserably bad, that the whole exhibition had infi-nitely more the appearance of the comic than of the Tragic Muse; and attending to it was so little interesting, and in my situation of mind so impossible, that I ought not to blame her Ladyship for en-deavouring to draw amusement from another channel, especially as I myself followed her example most part of the

evening: but there was an unfeeling and unpardonable indelicacy in testifying with so little disguise the ridicule which the poor people who were labouring for our amusement excited, and the bursts of ungoverned laughter, and severe raillery, that reached their ears from this polite party, was a mortification in which I would not for worlds have joined. I had the satisfaction of perceiving that Roats-ley was equally shocked at their beha-viour: and not only applauded wherever any particular expectation of approbation was betrayed, but engaged all the gen-tlemen round him to drown, by every tes-timony of satisfaction, the hissing with which Lady Elizabeth's gay admirer frequently assailed the performers.
               All particular conversation was at an end between Roatsley and me from the moment of Lady Elizabeth's appearance; and that which had preceded her en-trance, by perplexing andengrossing us,

had mutually unfitted us for discoursing on those little trifles that usually present themselves as topics of general discussion. He seemed so evidently oppressed with something that lay uneasily on his mind, that I could not possibly conclude mere curiosity to have excited an impression so apparently unsurmountable; and soothed and gratified as I had been in the beginning of the evening, I soon be-gan to suspect that he regarded with pain and displeasure the coquetry of Lady Elizabeth's behaviour. He often fixed his eyes upon her for some mo-ments together with a look of scrutiny and investigation, seemed to watch every word and movement that escaped her, and though he seldom addressed himself to her, to me he attended still less. He appeared indeed wholly absorbed by his own reflections; and scarce could I trace the same insinuating manner, which but

one half hour before had delighted me so much.
               The pain of this observation, which strehgthened every moment, convinced me I had been unconsciously deluding myself with false and chimerical hopes. If Lady Elizabeth was indifferent to him, why did her conduct so evidently affect and displease him; if his chains were heavy and his heart unconcerned, her pre-sent conduct was precisely what he ought to have desired and enjoyed; and if his eager professions of regard and friendship for me were as warm and potent as I wished them, whence came this sudden languor and reserve, when by an act of confidence I was about to give him a proof of my esteem.
               There was but one way of solving these inconsistencies, and it was blind-ness not to perceive it: involved in an engagement, with the splendid advan-tages of which probably he was himself

dazzled, he had resolved to pursue the path so anxiously pointed out to him by his family, while the folly and insipidity of the object of his vows, without ope-rating so violently as to deter him from his purpose, shocked his feelings and opened his eyes to the dangers of fulfilling it.
               These reflections only served to shew me that redoubled exertions were re-quired to fortify my mind against the weakness of my heart; and I began to form a secret plan of mental rigour which I flattered myself must in time re-store the tranquillity I had lost.
               Sufficient time was given me for these good resolutions; for Sir Edward on the one hand had been called away by Mr. Bradshaw, and Roatsley on the other preserved his determined silence so reso-lutely, that I had no apprehension of any interruption. The return of the former, however, at length forced me to

give a constrained attention to his con-versation; but finding that to affect a gaiety foreign to my feelings was beyond measure irksome and insupportable in my present frame of mind, yet conscious I could not too soon drive from my thoughts a crowd of flattering retrospec-tions, which sometimes for an instant banished my despondency and occasioned a new conflict, I endeavoured, as an escape both from Sir Edward and my-self, to lend an ear to the play, the pa-thetic beauties of which not even the miserable deficiencies of the performers could wholly obscure.
               The player who appeared in the cha-racter of Gloster, happened to be in fact blind; a circumstance which, as his voice was good and his action much su-perior to that of his companions, ren-dered him an interesting and most me-lancholy object. In the fourth act, when the unexpected meeting between Gloster

and his son takes place, the pathos and feeling with which the unhappy father exclaimedâ€”

                     â€”Oh dear son Edgar!
                     The food of thy abused father's wrath!
                     Might I but live to see thee in my touch
                     
                     I'd say I had eyes againâ€”
                  
affected me so poignantly, that I could not command my tears. In this how-ever I was not singular; for I perceived Roatsley equally softened: nothing in-deed could be more mournful than the scene before us, nor could any sound have appeared more inhuman than a loud and childish fit of laughter, which just at that instant burst from Lady Elizabeth. Good heavens! cried she to her admirer, if the people a'nt cry-ing. Nay that is too ridiculous indeed. Pray do look, Mr. Roatsley, turning to himâ€”pray for God's sake observe the tears; how soft and pretty all this is.
               He gave her no reply; but regarding

me for a moment, who on this occasion was the particular object of her observa-tion and ridicule, a sigh escaped him that seemed to be vented from the heart, and he again set himself to listen to the play with the anxiety of a person who wished to avoid all interruption.
               When all was concluded, Mr. Brad-shaw came up and enquired how I had been entertained. The performance on the whole, said he, was such as might have been expected, but that little stroke of Gloster's was truly pathetic.
               Lady Elizabeth, who did not distinctly hear what he said, chose to join in the conversation though she continued to preserve towards me the same contemp-tuous disregard, and demanded of what he was talking?
               I was mentioning to Miss Seymour, cried he, the circumstance, of the poor fellow who played Gloster.
               
                  
Oh yes! cried she, inconsiderately, I never laughed so much in my life.
               It is an excellent jest to the poor blind devil, returned he sarcastically, to be deprived of sight; and being constrained in that dismal state to make such ex-ertions for subsistence is a still better one.
               Lord I don't mean so, for that cer-tainly must be quite dreadful to be sure; only I was vastly amused seeing the peo-ple pretend to cry, when undoubtedly the whole affair was more like a farce than any thing else.
               There is Roatsley, returned Mr. Brad-shaw, who appears as much dejected as if he had been weeping the tender woes of Belvidera when performed by the ini-mitable Mrs. Siddons, and Miss Sey-mour too looks not only as if she had been crying, but as if she could cry for an hour to come.
               I merely look as if I was fatigued and half asleep, cried I.
               
                  
How unfortunate must I be in my choice of topics, answered he with a smile; for twice have I endured the mor-tification of learning from Miss Sey-mour's lips that I had set her asleep. Pray are you half asleep too, cried he, turning to Roatsley, are you infected with Miss Seymour's lethargic disorder. In-deed if I may be allowed (lowering his voice) to judge from appearances, I should pronounce you affected with simi-lar symptoms.
               This speech, pronounced with an ex-pression of the most cruel archness, and of which I did not lose a syllable, hurt me severely. The most painful confu-sion dyed my cheeks, and I had not cou-rage for some moments to look up, lest I should encounter the eyes of Roatsley; but I believe he was equally confounded and embarrassed, for he made no answer, and a short silence succeeded, which was beyond measure awkward and distressing.
               
                  

our abode. The sooner the alteration in our circumstances takes place, the sooner shall we be enabled to conquer that reluctance which it must at first occasion. We have been unwillingly constrained, from a cruel peculiarity in our fate, to prove a burthen on the humanity of our friends too long. I will not wound your delicacy by touching on the unspeakable obligations under which you have laid us, and for which simple gratitude is I fear all the return that will ever be allow-ed us to testify; that however you may be assured is warm from our hearts, and never can be effaced from our remem-brance: but your sister, Mrs. Hindon, we have incommoded greatly too long. I have been considering many different plans, continued I; but as a strict eco-nomy must be the basis of all our schemes, and that is in fact an art I have yet to learn, it is not easy to fix; neither, from my short residence in this country, am I

to disguise it. Finding his situation, in spite of all his efforts, ex-ceedingly uncomfortable, he made haste to change it, and abruptly took leave.
               
                  
                     
                        FEB. 25.
                     
                  
                  Fanny and Mr. Howard have this day had a long conversation together, in the course of which he laid before her the state of his finances, and suggested the plan of life which he thought would be most conducive to their mutual happiness.
                  His paternal estate, Hubert Hill, does not exceed three hundred and twenty pounds a year; and this, with a couple of thousands bequeathed him by a friend, constitutes his whole fortune; nor has he any addition to hope for independent of my sister's precarious pittance when Mr. Benseley's affairs are settled. This no doubt is a very slender income, especially
This was soon interrupted by Brad-shaw, who appeared rather to have en-joyed than regretted the mutual confu-sion he had occasioned. Miss Seymour, cried he, I was extremely sorry I was obliged to leave Holtenham without having the happiness of again seeing you. I wished much to enquire how you had rested, and longed particularly to know of you if you had discovered the solution of the enigma I gave you to unriddle.
               I have even forgot that you gave me any enigma to solve, said I; and as I raised my eyes to answer him with as much indifference as I could assume, I perceived Roatsley's eyes were fixed on my face with an expression of earnest penetration that wholly disconcerted me; happily, however, my sister, from whom by the accidental change of places I had been separated just then joined us; and some previous consultation in regard

to our mode of departure relieved me from further persecution.
               The evening, though a little cool, was pleasant, and walking, had I been able for it, was the method of travelling I should have preferred; but my sister, who in her rural situation retains the embers of latent vanity, was much pro-voked by the contempt and haughty in-solence with which our humble party had been treated by the proud train from Holtenham, and was not a little morti-fied at the idea of being obliged to find her way through a crowd of powdered footmen and magnificent equipages to go home on foot with the parson and his wife; while this fashionable company were leaving the rustic theatre with as much eclat and parade as had attended their entrance, followed by all the gay male part of the audience. She there-fore determined to remain till the last, and whisperingly informed me of the

reason; though Mr. Howard and the good Doctor, who were far from sus-pecting this plan, urged her to be gone, as it began to grow late and there was no apparent reason for delay.
               Poor Fanny, ashamed to confess this spark of secret pride, which would have appeared wholly incomprehensible to the one and perhaps rather absurd to the other, was put to great difficulties in order to compleat her project; but she was resolved to save herself this little humiliation if possible. Mrs. Heath-cote's care for herself and children, gave her likewise much pain. The good wo-man wrapt them all carefully up in large thick cloaks and handkerchiefs brought for the purpose, till they exactly resem-bled Russian boors in the prints of tra-vellers; and besought Fanny in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the house, to make herself warm, for walk-ing home in the night air was extremely

apt to give people colds; and indeed Mrs. Howard, though this cloak is old and a little worn out, it is thick and comfortable, and I wish you would allow me to wrap it round you.
               All this was the more severe on poor Fanny's irritable feelings, as Lady Mary's carriage, which had occasioned her some little delay, just then being announced, her Ladyship in passing stopped to bid her good night; and Lady Elizabeth following, escorted by her gay admirer, looked with a smile of ridicule but half suppressed, at the appearance of our companions.
               Roatsley, who had been called away by his sister, had returned but a moment before; but perceiving Lady Mary un-attended, again left me to conduct her to her carriage, having first besought the honour of seeing me to mine, and requested that I would not depart till his return. This circumstance rendered me

fully as anxious as my sister to delay our going, while I was no less ashamed to acknowledge the cause.
               My dear, cried Mr. Howard to Fanny on coming up to us, for heavens sake let us be gone. We shall lose the advantage of the moon if we are not directly on foot. It is already on its decline.
               I was silent; and she only replied by saying we should go presently.
               Unconscious of our secret views, he could only attribute to a childish desire of outstaying the company, our unwil-lingness to depart, and insisted on setting off immediately with me, leaving his wife under the care of the good parson, with whose family she was to walk home.
               My sister, much pleased with this plan, which left her motions in her own power, urged me to go; and severe as it was to leave the house before Roatsley's return, before we had finally adjusted at what time and in what place he was to

receive the communication so much de-sired, I was absolutely constrained to al-low Sir Edward to lead me to the little carriage. Had I been perfectly uncon-scious of any secret interest beyond that anxiety which I felt in common with my sister to be on terms of intimacy with a relation so amiable, I should undoubt-edly have acquainted Mr. Howard with my wish to remain, and acknowledged the cause; but the particulars were too long for immediate discussion at that mo-ment, and on that spot, where Sir Ed-ward never for an instant left my side: afraid therefore to discover an eagerness too keen, especially before Mr. Brad-shaw, of whose animadversions I was extremely apprehensive, I permitted Mr. Howard in silence to place himself by me and we drove off.
               On stepping in, I perceived by the glare of the flambeaux Roatsley in earnest conversation with Lady Elizabeth at the

window of Lady Mary's carriage, and he still stood in the same place when I lost sight of him.
               When we got home, Fanny being longer in making her appearance than we expected, Mr. Howard grew at length uneasy, and went himself to see after the walking party. Finding myself alone, I threw myself on a chair, and giving way to a train of reflexions which alternately soothed and tormented me, I indulged unconsciously in a fit of musing which softened rather than relieved me.
               But I hastily conclude this letter, hav-ing an immediate opportunity of sending it to my Sophia.
               
                  Adieu. H. SEYMOUR.

if a numerous family should bless their union; yet as Mr. Howard is a man of moderate views, and addicted to no ex-pensive pleasures, and Fanny has ever been accustomed to solitude and fruga-lity if not absolutely to a strict oecono-my, I think it sufficient, with some at-tention, for all the necessary indulgencies of life.
                  His little feat is situated, he says, in a delightful part of the country. The grounds are laid out with taste; and the house, tho' small, is fitted up with infi-nite neatness in a rustic style. This he proposes making their constant residence; and hopes, by living himself on the spot, to improve it to great advantage, being extremely fond of farming himself.
                  He did not fail, in the very first mo-ments of Fanny's approbation, to give me the warmest and most pressing invi-tation to join their family. Indeed with-out that condition I believe he never

would have prevailed with his bride, for she has ever expressed the most painful reluctance at the idea of being separated from me. It was no small satisfaction to me however, to perceive the cordiality and eagerness with which Mr. Howard made this request. Partial as I have al-ways been, said he, to the abode of my youth, with how much delight must I now enjoy it, when blest with compa-nions who possess the power of converting any spot into a paradise.
                  He sets out for Hubert Hill to-mor-row, to give the necessary directions previous to our going down; and in the mean while all other preparations are making, that the ceremony may take place as soon as he returns. Are you not entertained with Fanny's metamor-phosis into a sedate, rustic farmer's wife, who when you knew her but three years ago was a little wild giddy girl of thir-teen. I am satisfied however she will

conduct herself to admiration in that ca-pacity. She is possessed of a very chear-ful, contented disposition, the first bles-sing of Providence; and the reverses of fortune which the last five months have produced, by compleatly convincing her of the fallaciousness of her sanguine ex-pectations of the gay enjoyments of the world, formed in ignorance and solitude, have disposed her mind for relishing and returning to the pure pleasures of retire-ment and domestic life. In society, she has experienced only mortifications, dis-appointments, and disgusts, instead of finding it, as she had concluded, a scene of perpetual gaiety, admiration, and de-light. In lieu of universal conquest, her admirers have been transient, and her lover insincere. She has made no friends since she left France; and is therefore the more eager to cement to herself him who has proved on trial strongly and truly at-tached to her.
                  
                     
As for myself, this event is every thing I can wish. It secures me an agreeable home with those I love, and conveys me from this hateful city, which I wish from my soul I had never entered.
               
               
                  
                     
                        MARCH 3.
                     
                  
                  Mr. Howard is returned from his ex-cursion, much pleased with some little improvements he has begun; and the papers are now ready for signing. Mr. Howard, in the event of no family, leaves his wife sole heiress of all he pos-sesses: but should any children spring from this marriage, her jointure is two hundred per annum. Having no friend to consult on this occasion, all she feared was Mr. Howard's too great generosity; and as she was ashamed even to mention pecuniary matters to him, I was unwil-lingly obliged on this occasion to be her

agent, and absolutely insisted that if her own money, should any be recovered, was settled upon her as he proposed, a deduction of equal value should be made from this stipulation. Every thing there-fore relative to settlements is finally ad-justed; and but that Fanny's timidity makes her catch at trifles to delay the aweful ceremony, things ere now would have been concluded.
                  Fearing Mrs. Hindon would be ex-tremely disobliged at Fanny's conduct in concealing from her this affair, I per-suaded her the other day to confess her present situation; and suggested that as that lady, from whatever motives, had received us into her family, and testified towards us a thousand civilities with great apparent hospitality and kindness, she had reason to be not a little offended at the want of confidence and cordiality this secrecy betrayed; besides common report would soon render all further con-cealment

useless, and deprive Fanny of an opportunity of paying her the com-pliment of confidence.
                  She intreated me to undertake this commission for her. It was not an agree-able one; but as to Fanny it would per-haps have been still more awkward, I consented.
                  Good heavens! cried Mrs. Hindon, as soon as I had hinted 
                        â€¢
                     he connection which was likely soon to place my sister among the list of her relationsâ€”married to my brother! Miss Fanny to be my brother's wife! Well I declare he is extremely sly, for I could have laid a bet that you were his favorite of the two. He is a bold man however, to think of incumbering himself with a wife and fa-mily in his present circumstances. I wish them happy with all my heart; but I plainly perceive he had his own private reasons for regarding my poor nephew's proposals with so much disapprobation.

Well, every one for themselves in this world; but I always suspect some self-interested motive at bottom when I hear such a piece of work made about senti-ment, and so many professions of disin-terested friendship; I think besides, since matters were so far advanced, that Mr. Hindon and myself might have been sooner made acquainted with a love af-fair that was going on under our own roof.
                  I pleaded Fanny's diffidence as an apo-logy; but my excuse was in fact ex-tremely lame, and was not easily admit-ted. Mrs. Hindon could with difficulty prevail on herself to pardon the disrespect. But this story had gone in all points so contrary to her plans and wishes, that I could forgive a little ill humour occa-sioned by chagrin, and found it not on the whole so hard to reconcile her to it as I had feared. A marriage, tho' even not of her own negociating, afforded some

speculation for her active mind to work on; and so fond is she of being officiously busy, that she has set off to-day, accom-panied by Fanny, to assist with the ut-most cordiality and eagerness in the pur-chase of some bridal apparatus.
               
               
                  
                     
                        SIX IN THE EVENING.
                     
                  
                  I had hardly laid down my pen this morning, when Mr. Roatsley was an-nounced. The sight of him, so wholly unprepared as I was for the interview, threw me into the utmost confusion, and I am certain I must have performed the first ceremonials with great awkwardness. The recollection of his late conversation with Mr. Howard, of which I had been solely the subject, and the obligations his generous conduct had laid me under, overpowered me with embarrassment. I knew not how to express my gratitude

for a service so essential, which yet from a thousand circumstances I blushed to remember, and possessed scarce courage to touch on: added to this, the disco-very I had made since our last meeting, and the mortifications attending our re-jected application to his family, struck me so forcibly, that I was in agitation inexpressible when he entered.
                  He comes, thought I, at once to con-vince me how injurious were my suspi-cions of his pride and duplicity, to ex-press his regret for the ill conduct of his relations, and to shew me how dissimilar is his generous mind from that of his un-feeling mother.
                  So certain was I of the intention of his visit, that I even wished the explanation over, which must to him prove so em-barrassing, as it was likely so little to redound to the honor of his family, and expected every moment when the subject should be introduced. But most care-fully

an adequate judge of the safety or pro-priety of any step, without asking the advice and assistance of that friend whom Fate has left us. Do you imagine how-ever, without being too lavish of your trouble, that a reputable family might be found who would consent immediately to receive us for a moderate sum, till that mode of life can be clearly ascertained of which our finances will hereafter allow.
               Perhaps there might, said he. But surely Miss Seymour you do not think of removing immediately.
               You do not seem to approve of this scheme, cried I, finding he said nothing more and seemed buried in thought. Is there any other you would advise?
               Ah, Miss Seymour! cried he at last; there is a schemeâ€”but I tremble to men-tion it.
               At these words his face was overspread with a confusion which covered mine with blushes. The seriousness of his

did he guard against every topic that could lead to this point; which he evidently avoided with the most sedulous precaution. Yet his manner possessed that insinuating attention, and his voice that winning softness, which seemed to imply the utmost satisfaction in my com-pany, and which bestows on his a charm, that may be felt, Sophia, alas, too a-cutely! but which cannot be delineated.
                  The interesting elegance of his address is indeed so uncommonly engaging, that I think it must be wholly impossible even for a stranger to behold him enter with-out pleasure, or see him depart without experiencing regret. It is not alone that he is perfectly well bred and intelligent, for from moderate parts, polished by education and knowledge of the world, this may be expected, and uncharacte-ristic of the English nation as the refine-ment of good breeding is supposed to be, I have seen, since my residence here,

more than one person to whom I think that panegyric is justly due; but Mr. Roatsley's mind speaks in his counte-nance and in his manner, and confers on every look and on every motion that grace which a disposition compleatly amiable, and talents thoroughly well cul-tivated, cannot fail to diffuse over the appearance and behaviour.
                  My first flutters giving way to the re-spectful ease of his conversation, I took courage at length to mention the obliga-tion I owed him. I have been inex-pressibly desirous, said I, of an opportu-nity to return you my most grateful ac-knowledgments for the attention and trouble you have been so humane as to bestow upon an affair which has occa-sioned me more uneasiness and perplex-ity than it is possible to conceive.
                  I am then extremely sorry, cried he with warmth, that my presence should have induced you for an instant to recall

a subject so painful. Let it be banished, I beseech you, for ever from your re-membrance, and along with it all ex-pressions of gratitude to which I cannot flatter myself I merit the slightest claim. Heaven knows what exertions I would make, what anxiety I would undergo, to merit the approbation of Miss Seymour; but as yet I am not so happy as to con-gratulate myself with having had it in my power to perform any service that could deserve her thanks. Let me know my dear Madam, added he, by what means I can procure a title to that happi-ness, and you shall perceive, by the avi-dity with which I shall obey your com-mands, how infinitely I should prize my good fortune in obliging you.
                  Does he wish me, thought I, to apply to him to interceed with Lord Belmont; or are these professions mere words of course, to which are annexed neither meaning nor intention. I was piqued

that he adhered so determinedly to the resolutions of his relations, and only made a slight inclination of my head very gravely in return to this speech.
                  A degree of surprize was evident in his countenance at the stateliness of my man-ner; the cause I think he must have been with ease able to comprehend. However he chose to place it to another account; and finding that an air of chagrin invo-luntarily hung on my featuresâ€”â€”Miss Seymour, said he, after several ineffectual attempts to amuse me on different sub-jects which a slight degree of penetration sufficed to shew did not interest meâ€”I cannot but perceive that I have been so unfortunate as to offend you; and so se-vere, so painful is this idea, that tho' my confession may at first rather encrease than diminish your displeasure, I cannot resist trusting to your candour and indul-gence by a sincere avowal of the only circumstance wherein I think it is possible

for me to have given cause for your dis-pleasure.
                  Finding I made no reply, for in truth I knew not what to answerâ€”I sincerely confess, continued be, and let, I beseech you, the severity of this confession plead in my behalf, that after having been blest with your company that happy even-ing at Dover, my ideas and expectations of the dignity of your behaviour were raised to so just an height, that they could not but suffer some abatement on witnessing what I could not but consider as an impropriety, and which I am cer-tain Miss Seymour herself would have regarded as an indelicacy. I am con-scious I ought to have judged less rashly. I know that I ought to have suspected my own eyes, rather than any indecorum in you; but I was led to do you injustice by a multiplicity of circumstances, which can hardly have given more pain to your feelings than they have conveyed to mine;

and you may recollect, Madam, that the instant you appeared still more unac-countable, instead of plunging deeper into doubt, I penetrated into the whole mystery, and not only in my own mind fully acquitted you of the imprudence of a clandestine interview with a young man who merited only your scorn and de-testation, but also immediately perceived that though the whole was wrapt in ob-scurity, the veil was not placed over your conduct by your own hands; and I no longer hesitated to ask an explanation from Mr. Howard, since I was com-pleatly convinced all must redound to your honour.
                  Oh! Sir, cried I, penetrated by this speech and the eagerness with which he entered on his justification, be assured when I reflect on this painful affair, it is not only without the slightest displeasure at any part of your conduct, but with

the utmost gratitude for the humane in-terest you testified in it.
                  May I then flatter myself I am forgiv-en, cried he warmly, and kissed my hand with a fervor that dyed me with Crimson.
                  I had just withdrawn it, when Mrs. Hindon and Fanny returned from their excursion, followed by a servant loaded with various purchases.
                  I introduced Mr. Roatsley to Mrs. Hindon, who appeared much delighted with the acquisition of an acquaintance of his rank and figure, and began con-versing with her accustomed volubility and avidity even before she had seated herself.
                  As she held a pretty large parcel in her hands, part of Fanny's paraphranalia, he politely offered to relieve her by plac-ing it on the table.
                  Perhaps Sir, cried she facetiously, these ladies may generously reward your

trouble by presenting you with part of the contents.
                  I shall be much delighted with the honor of any gift from these ladies, re-turned he. But pray may I be allowed to ask of what nature is the donation?
                  Poor Fanny blushed up to the ears. Good God, Madam! cried she, with a reproachful look.
                  Nay, answered she, laughing immode-rately, I'm sure I shan't tell; but if Mr. Roatsley should be clever enough to guess it, you know neither of us can help that. Lord, look, look, cried she with entire disregard to Fanny's confusion, how con-scious Miss Fanny appears of the secret: and Miss Seymour, I declare she blushes too, as much as to sayâ€”but I must take care not to blab.
                  Roatsley smiled at our mutual confu-sion; for indeed I felt extremely for poor Fanny, and was not a little ashamed also for Mrs. Hindon's indelicate raillery.
                  
                     
If my enquiries give the ladies so much pain, said he, I am afraid I must be contented to remain in ignorance; tho' I confess my curiosity is raised to the highest pitch to discover this important secret.
                  Mr. Hindon just then entered; and an introduction taking place between him and Mr. Roatsley, I was in hopes Fanny would have been relieved from her per-secution. His lady, however, seemed determined such an excellent joke should not have so speedy a termination.
                  My dear, cried she, let us see if you
can solve this riddle, which has puzzled Mr. Roatsley's brain in vain to unravel, and the bare mention of which has plunged these ladies into the most painful confusion. The secret, or rather the so-lution, is contained in that package of brown paper that lies on the table.
                  I shall take a very simple method of discovery, returned he, and seizing the

parcel as Fanny was flying to secure it, he instantly cut the packthread with which it was tied, and holding it above her reach a number of favors composed of white and silver dropt on the ground.
                  The secret is discovered at length, ex-claimed Mrs. Hindon, laughing with great vociferation. Well I'm sure ladies you need not care much, for it is of a nature that will soon speak for itself, and I'm sure you must acknowledge I said never a word of the matter.
                  It is then a matrimonial one I presume, said Mr. Roatsley, with a constrained air and in a very low voice to Mrs. Hindon.
                  Yes, returned she, smiling expressively as if she was not at liberty to satisfy him further, though she evidently seemed impelled by a strong inclination to enter upon family transactions, equally unsoli-cited and impertinent.
                  Poor Fanny returned to her seat much ashamed and confused; while Mr. Hin-don

manner, the embarrassment that had seized him, and an unusual expression of softness in his countenance, altogether infused suspicions into my mind of the most distressing nature: but Mr. Howard instantly recovered his dignity, and tak-ing my hand with a benevolent smile, as if he had really penetrated into my thoughts and read my apprehensions.â€”Be not alarmed, said he; presumptuous my secret wishes perhaps once were, but I have been long sensible of their utter impropriety; and the conviction that they never could be crowned with success has long since nipped them in the bud. It is indeed a plan on which the whole hap-piness of my future life depends, but of which I now confess to you your lovely sister is the object.
               Situated as I was, continued he, (for I knew not what reply to make) an in-mate for months in your family, under the title of your father's friend, I enjoyed

following, laughed most indelicately in her face; and as I appeared little less embarrassedâ€”Poor Miss Seymour! cried he half ironically, tapping me familiarly on the back, Mr. Roatsley I am certain will agree with me that your complexion requires no foreign aid, so pray don't blush so very deep:â€”which piece of ad-vice you may suppose was not much cal-culated to enable me to profit from it.
                  Mr. Roatsley finding his presence ra-ther augmented the awkwardness of Fan-ny's situation, suddenly wished us good morning and departed abruptly.
                  This transaction was in itself trifling, had it not shewn the family with whom we reside in a vulgar and absurd point of view; and the affair of the parcel could have excited neither curiosity nor suspi-cion, had not Mrs. Hindon bestowed an importance on it by her ill-judged rail-lery, sufficient to convince Mr. Roatsley that something "more was meant than

met the ear." However, except in hav-ing given poor Fanny some uneasy mo-ments, it was of little consequence, as she has at length consented that Friday shall unite her with Mr. Howard; and imme-diately after the ceremony, at which on-ly Miss Parsons and this family are to be present, we set off for Hubert Hill; which being seventy five miles from town, we shall not reach till the second evening.
                  But tell me, my Sophia, how shall I account for Roatsley's behaviour during our tete a tete this morning? To sup-pose him entirely ignorant of an affair which must have naturally and unavoid-ably occasioned some disturbance, and no small degree of discussion in his fa-mily, is to imagine what is not only im-probable, but I own almost impossible. Have I not reason then to be displeased with the inflexible pride, (alas, it is a fa-mily failing!) which his conduct too plainly indicates: still perhaps retaining

the embers of that trifling partiality he seemed once disposed to feel for me, yet proudly ashamed, or weakly afraid to venture on a step his family unjustly pro-hibits, he seeks my company and con-versation under the pretended veil of ig-norance. But under a pretence so shal-low, never shall he receive the shadow of my notice, never shall I countenance that person as my friend, who disdains to acknowledge he is allied to me.
                  Yet, my dear, how impossible is it to see Mr. Roatsley and to retain displea-sure. In vain I call offended dignity and wounded pride to the aid of my indigna-tion. He is absent, and I blame him; but when present, to preserve even a cold reserve, proves the utmost exertion of my resolution.
                  
                     H. SEYMOUR.
                  
               
            
            
               

               LETTER XV. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  
                     MARCH 6.
                  
               
               HOW infinitely insinuating is this proud cousin of our's. I become every hour more afraid of myself, yet every moment exhausts my imagination with efforts to discover indulgent motives for a conduct which reason and feeling equal-ly condemn.
               Mrs. Hindon having asked the favor of his company to her assembly last night, I was not surprised to see him en-ter: for I confess I expected he would profit from her invitation, tho' at the time he had hinted something of a prior engagement, which he said in all proba-bility

would prevent him. But never was I so much struck, so much con-founded by his appearance. How in-conceivably superior did he look to every one of his own sex who was present.
               There is an air of dignity, I had almost said of grandeur, in his figure, equally the result of the most elegant symmetry of form and the most lively penetration and intelligence of countenance, which to a superficial observer might, I should ima-gine, at first sight wear the aspect of hauteur, did not the amiable softness of his address entirely contradict that idea; and I make no doubt but this contrast may augment the prepossession which every one on the slightest acquaintance seems inclined to feel for him; for all must be delighted to perceive that person who appears, tho' merely from the grace-ful superiority of his height, to look down on others, descend on conversing with them into the gentlest and least assuming equality.
               
                  
The apartments were filled with com-pany before he arrived; and being sur-rounded by a group of young people at one end of the room, he did not imme-diately distinguish me.
               Shall I confess that I felt impatient on finding myself unnoticed, and hurt at per-ceiving that Mrs. Hindon, on his en-trance, detained him in conversation a considerable time. I found some conso-lation, however, in observing that he seemed to give her his attention with constraint, and that he often cast his eyes with anxiety around, as if but little interested in what he heard.
               During this interval Miss Farnford and another young lady detained me in an insipid chit chat, while both my eyes and mind wandered to another subject. Having soon discovered him however, he instantly engaged their admiration, and attracted their whole attention.
               
                  
Who's that, pray, Miss Pierson? ex-claimed Miss Farnford.
               It is the handsome Mr. Roatsley. I'm sure you must have heard of him, re-turned the other.
               He is absolutely the handsomest crea-ture I ever beheld. Pray is he a man of fortune?
               Lord, cried the friend, don't you know that he is brother to Lord Linrose, and possessed of heaven knows how many thousands a year. He is just returned from abroad, in consequence of a splen-did inheritance left him by an uncle in Ireland; and all the world says that he is amazingly clever, accomplished and agreeable; indeed he has all the appear-ance of it, for he is astonishingly hand-some.
               I should suppose then he a'nt married, since he is so lately come home?
               No, but just on the verge of being so. The wedding cloaths and equipages are

all bespoke, and I'm told his marriage is to take place immediately.
               Oh! Sophia! don't you feel for me at this moment. My sensations were un-utterable. I felt as if my blood was con-gealed within my veins, and every pulse had refused any longer to perform it's function. I had not courage sufficient to ask Miss Pierson what authority she had for this unlook'd-for information; but my companions, unsuspicious of my agi-tations, went on with their conversation in a half whisper, and Miss Farnford's curiosity soon satisfied mine.
               But who pray is the happy woman? cried she gayly.
               Lord Mortonbury's daughter, Lady Elizabeth Sedley. She is a piece of per-fection by all accounts. Nobody before was ever so accomplished. She has all sorts of languagesâ€”music, painting, nay poetry too, at her finger's ends; then she is reckoned a prodigious fine woman,

and dances divinely. Besides all this, she has a vast fortune, being an only child; so that she is esteemed the first match almost in England; and they say that her father and Lord Belmont, Mr. Roatsley's grandfather, have all along designed them for each other, even from their infancy.
               Well, that's so odd in old people, re-turned Miss Farnford. I'm sure if papa was to do so by me, I should hate my husband horridly, were he ever so hand-some.
               That is far from being the case with Lady Elizabeth; for it seems she is vastly in love with him, and indeed no wonder, for I suspect in her situation you would not carry your love of contradiction quite so far.
               Miss Pierson's conversation was sud-denly interrupted by Mr. Roatsley's ap-proach; who having just at this moment discovered me, came forward in the

height of my perturbation, with a smile which was suddenly on regarding me converted into a look of apprehension and anxiety. The intelligence to which I had just been listening, could not fail to give me the most uneasy emotions, and the mortification attending this secret confession, wounded me no less. What? cried I to myself, have I been all this while weakly allowing an attachment to steal on my heart, which can neither be excused by reason nor principle? Why do I envy another that happiness which I never had the slightest grounds for be-lieving would ever prove mine? and why should I feel myself so unaccountably in-terested in the fate of a man, of whose pride and inflexibility, spite of his insinu-ating exterior, I have such glaring proofs?
               These interrogations, tho' meant to rouse me from my too susceptible weak-ness, had by no means the desired effect;

a dangerous intimacy to which no other man had access. The snare, even at forty three, was not to be avoided; for where the mind and form both equally conspire to charm and seduce, no age is exempted from feeling their united force. Against such there is no defence, and one only cure; for where hope is completely extinguished passion seldom continues to torment. In this case it often changes both its nature and its name, and melio-rating into a tender friendship, consti-tutes a less selfish gratification instead of proving the misery of our lives.
               This, Miss Seymour, has been exactly my case. My efforts however to escape from one danger have led me into ano-ther no less insinuating. Tho' I intreat you to believe me, when I solemnly de-clare that I never was for one moment either so mad or so interested as to wish for my own enjoyment at the price of your amiable sister's prosperity; nor

and scarcely had Mr. Roatsley begun the usual enquiries after my health, when he addedâ€”I am afraid, Miss Seymour, your countenance replies too plainly to my question. I am afraid you find your-self indisposed. Perhaps the heat of the room affects you? W
                     â€¢
                  ll you allow me the honour of conducting you to the other, where you will have more air, I imagine. Hardly able to reply, I al-lowed him to lead me away tacitly con-firming his conjecture, partly from the effects of an unconquerable embarrass-ment which seized me at that instant, and partly with the view of concealing my agitation from my two companions, of whose suspicions I was apprehensive.
               Miss Farnford however, the instant she saw me addressed by a young man of so elegant an appearance, contrived to pin herself to me for the rest of the even-ing, in hopes of improving this acciden-tal meeting into an acquaintance; and

made so many attempts to attract his no-tice and engage him in conversation, that I really blushed for the forward and child-ish coquetry of her behaviour; particu-larly as from seeing her constantly by my side, or hanging on my arm, he must have concluded her one of my most inti-mate friends; and tho' he answered her with civility, and the most scrupulous good breeding, he seemed by no means charmed with her stile of manners.
               She was so much delighted with him however, that I was in continual pain lest he should overhear her expressions of admirationâ€”a matter which gave her very little concern. Pray don't you think this Mr. Roatsley the finest young man you ever beheld in your life? said she at length, when he had turned for a mo-ment to speak with Mrs. Hindon.
               Yes, he is handsome, said I, with an affected air of indifference. At least I believe he is thought so.
               
                  
Thought so! repeated she; Lord but don't you think so. I never saw any person have so much the look of a man of fashion. But he is just going to be married.
               Is he, said I, faintly.
               Yes indeed, and the lady is so in love with him as never any body was before. Indeed I don't wonder at that circum-stance in the least. But pray don't you think it is too much to be Mr. Roatsley and the possessor of such prodigious wealth at once? Don't you think so?
               Yes, perhaps;â€”oh no, not at all, re-turned I with an emotion to which only Miss Farnford could have been blind; but eager to talk, she perceived not my perplexity, or attributed it to my late indisposition.
               But pray tell me, how did you become so well acquainted with him?
               We crossed over in the same packet boat from Calais.
               
                  
Did you indeed. I wish I had made one of the party. I dare say it must have been a very agreeable one.
               Yes, pleasant enough, said I, quite fatigued with giving attention to a train of questions so little interesting, while my thoughts were entirely occupied with a subject that proved, alas! too much so.
               Mr. Roatsley again joining us, pre-vented her proceeding; and Lady Farn-ford's carriage being announced, Miss was summoned soon after to attend her mother. Being then relieved from the frivolous interruption of our companion, wo entered into a conversation, the life and spirit of which were maintained solely by his own efforts; for though I exerted myself to the utmost, a weight unspeakable oppressed my spirits, and wholly dampt the satisfaction this even-ing would have otherwise afforded.
               Yet I own his behaviour puzzled and

astonished me. Had you witnessed what passed during this evening, Sophia; had you beheld the unconscious ease with which he conversed, you never could have suspected that any desire of conceal-ment lay upon his mind. All seemed open, sincere, and unreserved. He ap-parently wished me to confess many little circumstances relating to our life abroad, and even presumed to hint at enquiries respecting my father and our abode in Languedoc, tho' with a politeness quite distinct from impertinent inquisitiveness, and with which, in a stranger, I might have been gratified, supposing them the result of interest in my concerns; but which in my cousin I could only suspect to be the consequence of an imperfect information that had excited his curio-sity. These are conclusions, however, which did not till afterwards occur. At the time, I could think of nothing but the intelligence that had just been com-municated

to me, and the destruction of a thousand airy dreams which had made the strongest impression in my bosom.
               Oh! my Sophia! however you may and must condemn, do not despise me for the weakness which every line of my journal displays. Good heavens! were any eyes but yours to see my writing! The very idea makes me tremble. But to unburthen my mind to you, by dis-closing my inquietudes, is the only so-lace of my existence. When I reflect how unreserved, how perfectly free from concealment or restraint, are my com-munications, I can scarce conceive how I possess resolution to transmit them to writing. Indeed had not an early habit of confidence familiarised me to the idea of laying open my heart upon paper, I should never have found courage to risk the hazards of so long a journey as they must take before they reach your hands.
               Mr. Roatsley declined joining any of

the card parties, tho' strongly solicited by Mrs. Hindon; and Fanny being en-gaged at the commerce table, he gave to me his whole attention. He enquired what were my engagements in public, and hoped to have the pleasure of meet-ing me either at Ranelagh next evening, or at the Opera on Saturday: but I said, that on my sister's account I should not have it in my power to visit any public place till her affairs were finally settled; and that immediately after it, I should accompany her to the country.
               What? said he with some surprise, at this unpropitious season do you think of leaving town? I hope, however, your stay will be short? The country can have no attractions at present.
               I have no thoughts of returning again to town, answered I with a melancholy I could not wholly repress. A thousand reasons conspire to make me wish myself settled in the country, tho' we were

blocked up with snow and enjoyed not the society of a single individual out of our own little family circle for months to come.
               That is a very singular taste at your time of life, said he. That Miss Sey-mour should incline to seclude herself in retirement is not merely cruel, but I had almost said, unnatural. Shall I not even have the pleasure of seeing you at the Opera before you go?
               I answered I was afraid not, as we were to set off on Friday. At this moment Mrs. Hindon approaching, requested that he would favour her with his com-pany to supper together with a small party who had been selected.
               To this he instantly consented. On seating ourselves at table, tho' he made an attempt to get by me, I was placed at a considerable distance, as Mrs. Hindon, out of respect, asked him to seat himself at the upper end, at her right hand, and

entertained him in a very earnest half-whisper during the repast.
               Sensible of her imprudence, I was seized with apprehension lest we and our situation were the topics on which she had chosen to expatiate; which, from her extreme neglect of delicacy and entire disregard to propriety, was not improba-ble, and must have involved us in the se-verest mortification. I was seriously mi-serable from the instant this suspicion oc-curred; and began even to dread that she had been soliciting his aid or plead-ing our cause;â€”an idea that tormented me in the cruellest manner; for she often glanced her eye on Fanny and on me, and led Mr. Roatsley to regard us in a similar manner. I am now happily re-lieved however from these fears; for when I afterwards sounded her on the subject, she did not betray by the slightest hint having acted so imprudently, nor

could I gather from her discourse any circumstances to alarm me.
               After supper I was asked to sing. Mr. Roatsley is passionately fond of music, and confessed himself a performer on several instruments. This you may be-lieve did not diminish my natural timi-dity; but the intreaties of the company were so pressing, and those of Mr. and Mrs. Hindon so importunate, that I was constrained to comply, and acquitted myself indeed very ill.
               My spirits, low and oppressed, made the little song of "Ah! my charmante Louise" affect me almost to tears while I sung. How many painful recollections did it bring to my mind, when my So-phia and myself received our instructions together in that delightful accomplish-ment.
               I slept very ill last night. Confound-ed by a variety of conjectures, I knew not which implicitly to credit. From one

while her future prospects seemed favor-able, and her situation in life promised to prove almost equal to her merits, should any consideration on earth have induced me to make known my present presump-tion. I should have had then no re-maining wish but for her happiness and success in every pursuit. The disap-pointment of my wishes as to the latter, has however given birth to hopes that the first is not still unattainable, and induced me to flatter myself that should she deign to allow of my most zealous endeavours to contribute to it, it may not prove be-yond my power in some measure to con-sole her for what she has lost.
               Do not however imagine, that I shall so far descend from my age and charac-ter as to be offended by a refusal. An admirer at my time of life must not pre-tend to assume the lover of twenty. I am aware of the great inequality of our years, and of many other objections your

source of anxiety however I considered it was in my power to be relieved, and any certainty was preferable to my present suspense: besides, to matrimonial intel-ligence entire belief is not always to be given; and as Roatsley observes, to what we dread we are most liable to give our confidence; I therefore resolved to pay a morning visit to Miss Pierson, to whom I have owed one a considerable time, but whose acquaintance indeed, till this acci-dent, I had not much inclination to cul-tivate. At present however she is the only channel from whence I can draw in-formation, and her society is become in-teresting. I intended, with all the ap-parent indifference I could assume, to renew the subject of her recent intelli-gence, and endeavour to discover on what grounds she had advanced the fact with such apparent certainty. She was from home however when I called, and I am just returned not a little disap-pointed.
               
                  
How unlucky it is that I must leave town while I remain in this painful un-certainty. Yet why do I call it so, when but for the delusions of a too sanguine mind I should not harbour a doubt con-cerning the authenticity of Miss Pierson's intelligence. I have formed fifty little schemes to meet with her; but not being able to form a pretext for calling again myself, I intend to make Fanny go in my place to pick up what accounts she can learn respecting this affair.
               
                  
                     
                        ELEVEN AT NIGHT.
                     
                  
                  Miss Pierson has saved me the trou-ble of planning some little artifice to meet with her, by returning my visit this very evening in an easy way, accompanied by Miss Farnford.
                  My heart beat severely at their en-trance. How do circumstances, appa-rently

the most trivial, change the face of things. Two girls, whose acquaint-ance but a few days ago, from the frivo-lous though harmless insipidity of their conversation I should rather have avoided than courted, were now become the ob-jects of my most anxious solicitude.
                  I was in hopes, from the eagerness with which they had before entered on the subject I now wished so much to in-troduce, that they might of themselves lead to it; and one is but too apt to con-clude others in some measure influenced by circumstances that convey interest and agitation to our own bosoms. Miss Farn-ford and her friend were struck with Roatsley's elegance, and the intelligence of a wedding, interesting to all girls, had attracted their curiosity and attention; but after the conjecture relating to jew-els, settlements, finery, &amp;c. were ad-justed, to which such a topic generally gives birth, the idea in all probability

occurred to them no more. I was there-fore obliged to touch on it myself in the manner I imagined least liable to suspi-cion. Fortunately the penetration of my companions was not to be dreaded, and still more fortunately Mr. and Mrs. Hin-don were engaged abroad.
                  In the course of conversation I men-tioned a catalogue of marriages as the news of the day; and tacked Mr. Roats-ley's to the end of my list, tho' not with-out a glow on my cheek.
                  O don't you remember it was I who told you of that match, said Miss Pier-son, the other night when we were here.
                  I will not vouch for the authenticity of half my intelligence, said I; and per-haps little more credit ought to be given to this last union than to many of the others.
                  Oh I ask your pardon. I assure you Mr. Roatsley's marriage is an undoubted fact. But certainly you ought to know

all about it better than any body, for I am told that he is your cousin; tho' I be-lieve I ought to request your excuse for mentioning it, as I believe you don't wish it to be made public.
                  I never heard of it till the other even-ing, said I; and now that I recollect, you I believe was my authority.
                  And that I promise you is as good as possible: for Lady Mary Lawrence, who is aunt to Lady Elizabeth Sedley, and who has had the charge of her from her infancy, (Lady Mortonbury having died when her daughter was quite a child,) is extremely intimate with my mother, and has frequently mentioned to her this projected alliance, which she is exceed-ingly eager should take place, as the young man is a very particular favorite with her, and she designs I know to pre-sent her niece with a very valuable set of jewels on the occasion, and they are actu-ally bespoke: tho' Lady Mary told my

mother the affair was not to be concluded till Lord Belmont's return from abroad, (who has been the chief promoter of the match,) and his Lordship is not expected till autumn; therefore the marriage is not publicly talked of by the relations on either side, but all the world knows of it for all that.
                  My doom is then fixed, said I to my-self. My authority is undoubted, and all delusion at an end. Let me not sink however with unpardonable weakness under the blow. Let me resist this over-whelming regret with all my fortitude. Had it not been from the foible of a too susceptible heart, all efforts had been on this account unnecessary. Let me there-fore atone to my own mind by the most rigorous exertions for the error I have committed, and let a name so fatal, so interesting, be mentioned in my journal no more.
                  These reflections, which in an instant

passed through my mind, bestowed a mo-mentary enthusiasm that enabled me to talk with a composure on the subject for which I applauded myself not a little.
                  I make no doubt but Lady Elizabeth will be extremely happy, said I, for Mr. Roatsley really seems to be an agreeable man.
                  Oh! extremely clever and agreeable certainly, cried Miss Farnford, (who had been examining some work with Fanny above stairs, but who just then returned,) and the handsomest creature I ever be-held. But I think if he is actually go-ing to be married the lady has reason to be not a little jealous, for if ever I disco-vered a man to be in love in my life, Mr. Roatsley is deeply so with Miss Seymour.
                  I blushed excessively, but attempted to laugh it off.
                  Nay you need not blush so violently, cried Miss Pierson, for Miss Farnford

did not accuse you of being in love with him. I give you my word however I made the same observation. During supper his eyes were never from you; and when you sung, (and really you sung di-vinely,) I never beheld a countenance ex-press admiration and delight as his did. He seemed to feel every note.
                  My confusion was inexpressible. Con-scious guilt made me extremely appre-hensive lest it should excite the notice and raillery of my two gay companions; and Fanny, instead of endeavouring to relieve me from my embarrassment, had the roguery to plunge me still deeper in-to difficulties. If music be the food of love, cried she, Mr. Roatsley was proba-bly dreaming of his intended during the song, and of course might be more feel-ingly disposed to relish its pathetic charms than if he had been in the same comfortable state of indifference with the performer. This she uttered with a most

malicious smile; but fortunately the la-dies were in haste to pay other visits, and left us soon after.
                  Adieu, my dear Sophia. I shall not write again till the marriage is concluded.
                  
                     H. SEYMOUR.
                  
               
            
            
               LETTER XVI. TO MISS BEAUMONT.
               
                  HUBERT HILL,
MARCH 10.
                  
               
               HERE we are, all safe and well; tho' we have had two dismal days for travel-ling, and did not arrive at the end of our journey till late yesterday evening, the roads being rendered almost impassable by a late very heavy fall of snow. We

found a comfortable, snug mansion, a delightful fire, and an elegant little re-past ready to be placed on the table, all of which we enjoyed extremely, after having been frozen so many hours on the road.
               Dinner being over, Mr. Howard car-ried us through the different apartments of this rustic dwelling, which are fitted up with infinite taste though with a fru-gality adapted to its size and simplicity. None of the rooms are large, but chear-ful in the highest degree, and having been all newly painted, papered, &amp;c. possess an air not only of uncommon neat-ness, but even of elegance, a property which in my opinion consists in symme-try rather than in splendor.
               I know you will expect the particulars of the wedding: but neither romance nor incident is to be expected where six-teen is united to forty. Fanny would allow of no forms, though Mrs. Hindon

sister may feel, and the force of which she may not be able to surmount. If howe-ver she thinks, after consulting with you, that there are any advantages to compen-sate these obstacles, if the warmest at-tachment and the most unbounded in-dulgence, if my legal protection, and the command of a fortune much too narrow, alas! for her pretensions and almost be-neath her acceptance, yet with which I flatter myself a mind like her's could be contented;â€”if these circumstances weigh in any degree against the opposite scale, I must so far adopt the language of a lo-ver as to declare that she will literally render me the happiest of men. I shall receive her hand as a fresh blessing from heaven, and regard it as a condescension for which I shall ever consider myself her debtor.
               Some hints in this speech of Mr. How-ard's had confused me so extremely, that I made no attempt to answer or interrupt

wished extremely to detain us a few days, to introduce a little merriment to season, as she said, the solemnity of the affair. But Fanny was inexorable. She would not even consent to make a bridal ap-pearance; but was drest simply in a tra-velling dress, being on the wing for Hu-bert Hill.
               
                  
                     
                        MARCH 11.
                     
                  
                  This morning being a clear frost, we walked out for an hour and an half. The country around could not be seen to advantage, where every object was co-vered 
                        â€¢
                     ith snow; yet it appeared beau-tiful. The house is situated in the most romantic spot I ever beheld; fronting the south west, on the gentle slope of a hill which rises by a very gradual assent. A noble river, the banks of which are shaded with very fine old trees, runs be-low,

within sight of the windows; and the eminence behind, on which there is a thriving plantation, gives the little mansion a very snug appearance. The garden is an excellent one, and well stored with common fruit trees of the best kinds, that amply compensate for the want of those luxurious ones to be obtained only through the expensive aid of a hot house. The pleasure ground, tho' of small extent, is laid out with ad-mirable taste, and the little inclosures kept in such good order, that I think in summer Hubert Hill must be the most delightful spot in the world.
                  I am surprized Mr. Howard spoke so faintly in its praise. But no doubt he wished to surprize us in favor of our fu-ture residence. It is on a very small scale indeed, and partakes more of an ornamented farm than a country feat; but I think the worthy owner has reason to be not a little vain of the improvements

he has himself effected since it came into his possession by the death of his father; an event that took place only a few years previous to his acquaintance with our family.
                  From the period of his succession to Hubert Hill till that of his leaving Eng-land, an amiable sister, who died of a consumption at the age of twenty-nine, presided at the head of his table; and it is to her taste and regularity that Fanny owes the comfortable and neat elegance of various conveniences not to be expec-ted in the house of a bachelor.
               
               
                  
                     
                        MARCH 19.
                     
                  
                  Nothing but continual rain or snow, and no possibility of stirring out of doors. We endeavour, however, to make our-selves the more comfortable within; Fanny, who makes all the bustle of a

young mistress of a family vain of the importance of her new charge, finds con-tinual amusement and employment in directing all her little houshold matters, for which she really seems to possess a talent, tho' I sometimes alledge that her orders are calculated rather to confuse than adjust. Being displeased with the furniture of her drawing room, which is a little antique, we have set about a se-rious piece of work in order to fit it up with elegance. We have begun to work chairs and hangings in imitation of na-tural flowers; which, as there is scope given both for taste and ingenuity, is an agreeable occupation. You know this sort of work is a convent accomplish-ment; by which means Fanny and I are adepts in it. I have likewise undertaken to cover the walls of the little chearful parlour with landscapes, for which many delightful scenes even from its windows furnish ample subject; so that we are

provided with abundant employment for at least a twelvemonth to come. Mr. Howard, who has a well chosen collec-tion of the works of the best authors, both French and English, generally reads to us while we sit at work. The even-ings we divide with a little music, and our favourite chess, so that they never ap-pear too long, and our life on the whole glides along in a tenor so smooth, ratio-nal and placid, that I hope in a short time to enjoy it with perfect relish. Even at present I am conscious I could no where be more happy.
               
               
                  
                     
                        MARCH. 21
                     
                  
                  This evening I received a letter from Mrs. Hindon. Oh Sophia into what agita-tion has it not thrown me. Read, my dear, what that officious woman writes.
                  
                     
                        

                        TO MISS SEYMOUR.
                        I have been prevented from writing you sooner, my dear Miss Seymour, by a slight fever, which though by no means alarming, proved troublesome for a few days, and was attended by a headach so severe that an application to my pen has been till this day wholly impracticable; although I have been for this week past extremely desirous to inform you of a piece of good fortune, the merit of which I must take entirely to my self. To give you a clear and distinct idea of the whole affair, I must begin by previously ac-quainting you, that perceiving you ad-hered obstinately to your resolution of at-tempting no further application to your family, a measure which I always freely confessed to you I could not but highly disapprove of, I myself, out of mere friendship, determined upon a step, the happy success of which I am convinced

must for once induce you to applaud my management.
                        As Mr. Roatsley, from his visits and polite civility, appeared to have taken no part in the family transactions, I seized an opportunity, the evening he did us the honour of supping with us, to hint at the difficulties and distressing embar-rassments in which doubtless you must have found yourselves involved, had not the marriage of the one sister offered an agreeable home for both: but what was my surprize on finding that he listened to me with all the pity and astonishment of a man who was wholly unconcerned in the affair; and when, emboldened by the compassion he testified, I ventured to tell him what a severe disappointment Lord Belmont's cruel behaviour had proved, he declared he had never been informed of the application, nor could he believe it possible he said that an affair so melan-choly and interesting should have failed

of success with his Lordship, whose heart was open to every call of distress and to every sentiment of humanity. These were Mr. Roatsley's very words. De-lighted to find my auditor so much more agreeably disposed than I could have hoped for, you may believe I delayed not laying hold of this favourable moment to expatiate on the mortifying and severe reverse of situation which but a very short time ago had been all at once pre-sented before your eyes, by the cruel re-jection of his Lordship, whose favour was now become, through the impru-dence of your late guardian, still more essential. I represented, in terms the most pathetic and moving, the state of distressful poverty and dependence, to which but so lately it seemed likely you must both have been reduced, had not the happy and fortunate event before mentioned in part offered a relief, and I failed not to hint, in a pretty explicit

manner, how useful and acceptable, nay how necessary some addition to your present finances must undoubtedly prove; more especially as your future expecta-tions, were they even realized to the ut-most of your hopes, would afford but a very scanty support and be scarcely ca-pable of bestowing the mere necessaries of dress; while for those of subsistence you was constrained to depend upon the limited income of your brother in law.
                        Never was man more affected than Mr. Roatsley at this recital, and he ex-pressed his sympathy in the strongest terms. We had not however either lei-sure or opportunity for discussing matters fully. But he faithfully promised to ex-ert his utmost activity and avail himself of Lord Belmont's interest towards con-tributing to place you in a situation suit-able to your birth and education. So eager was he in the cause, that he called two different times on the two succeeding

days, with the intention no doubt of making further enquiries and to consult what could be done most speedily and ef-fectually for your service. I was un-luckily from home both times, but I think you told me you had seen him the day before you left town, tho' I perceived he had not chosen as yet to make his good intentions known to you; and on my part, as I doubted not but my ap-plication would turn to good account, I had determined to be silent on the sub-ject till I could surprize you agreeably with the certainty of your good fortune. The morning after Mr. Roatsley again did me the honour of calling; but we were then all engaged at church on the grand affair. Having been so unsuccess-ful, he addressed himself to me by letter the very evening after, and a very pretty letter it is, I give you my word, inform-ing me in the genteelest terms that his endeavours in behalf of my friend had

him, except by bowing my head in ac-knowledgment of the compliments he paid me. Finding however that he now expected a reply, I thanked him in my sister's name for the honour of his good opinion; as to what success his proposal might receive, I declared myself wholly ignorant; grateful she cannot fail to prove, said I, but what lengths that sen-timent may carry her, I am unable to conjecture.
               If Miss Fanny, said he, elated with the gay hopes and lively prospects of youth, should think with reluctance on uniting herself to a man whose age corresponds so ill with her own, I must regret with fervor, but never shall repine at her de-termination. There is one obstacle how-ever, Miss Seymour, which severely damps my feeble hopes, and is indeed the circumstance that has induced me to open my intentions first to you, as it is a particular in which I imagine you can

been so happily crowned with success, that thro' the interest of a certain noble-man in power, who was the intimate friend of Lord Belmont, a pension of two hundred per annum had been pro-cured for Miss Seymour, while she re-mained unmarried.
                        But as I have reason to imagine, (says he, for I give you the very words of his letter,) that your amiable young friend labours under present difficulties, will you Madam venture to assist me in a pious fraud which will engage my warm-est gratitude and respect: your friendship and intimacy in all probability must af-ford you a pretext for offering Miss Sey-mour that assistance which it may be improper to appear as coming from me. In answer to this, I immediately wrote Mr. Roatsley that I agreed most willingly to his generous scheme, and the day fol-lowing received a bill for two hundred pounds, enclosed in a letter as expressive

of gratitude and acknowledgments as if I had conferred on him the greatest of all favors.
                        As a boon from so near a relation, pro-bably intended as a discharge in full of all demands upon himself and his rela-tions, I cannot suppose that even your delicacy, (over refined as I have some times thought it,) will object to the pre-sent; neither can I prevail with myself to take the merit of a gift, the magnifi-cence of which, when considered as mine, must undoubtedly have awakened your suspicion. Mr. Roatsley made yet ano-ther attempt to visit me soon after this transaction, but I was confined to my bed, and had it not in my power to see him.
                        Adieu, dear Miss Seymour! Pray accept Mr. Hindon's best wishes and mine, and present the same to my bro-ther and his fair bride; and believe me
                        
                           your sincere friend and servant, MARTHA HINDON.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     

Oh! Sophia! what were my emotions on reading this letter! No words can speak my feelings. Though penetrated with the exertions of my amiable cousin in my favour, how severely was I morti-fied, how deeply wounded, to find my-self the object of his compassionâ€”of his generosityâ€”of his pecuniary assistance. Oh! how did all the pride of my heart rise at the humiliating idea.
                  Why did Mrs. Hindon presume to in-terfere, without my knowledge or con-sent, in an affair for which she possesses the requisites neither of judgment nor delicacy. Proud as she appears of her success, I shall for ever regret the busy officiousness which dictated a step so dreadful to me to think of. Yet I fear I am unjust. The poor woman had cer-tainly no apparent aim but my advantage in this unlucky transaction, and perhaps prejudice alone induces me to suspect it the mere effects of her intermedling dis-position,

which derives its highest grati-fication from prying into the concerns of others, and is delighted to find occupa-tion for its restless and frivolous activity.
                  The letter, at the first reading, threw me into agonies. I perceived only the mortifying point of view in which Mrs. Hindon had represented me to Roatsley, and that reflection poisoned and wholly embittered the satisfaction which the no-tion of his anxiety and interest might otherwise have excited. To paint in co-lours the most pitiable and moving, so as to raise his pity and sympathy, the si-tuation to which we might have been reduced?â€”good heavens! can she ima-gine this a circumstance from which I could derive satisfaction? Her repre-sentation too was by no means just, and had not even the merit of truth to re-commend it: for tho' at present I am constrained to depend upon the limited income of my brother in law, Mr. How-ard

expects that a very few weeks will in all human probability see Mr. Benseley's affairs adjusted, and two thousand pounds at least retrieved, for his wife's share and mine, out of the wreck of our for-tune. From the interest of my patri-mony, slender as it is, in this retired abode I am certain I shall have not only all my necessary wants supplied, but pos-sess the ability of making such little use-ful presents to my sister, as shall secure to me my independency in my own eyes. But this is a notion which to Mrs. Hin-don must appear the mere fiction of a romantic brain. Born an heiress, and accustomed to derive that vain impor-tance on which her heart is fixed from the possession of wealth and an ostenta-tious display of grandeur, she regards opulence as the first of human blessings and its deprivation as the harbinger of the most acute misery.
                  Of the pension I heard with unfeigned

regret. Shocked at the circumstances which had given birth to the acquisition, I felt it as a painful weight which de-pressed my mind, and from which to be free I would have given the world had I possessed it. But having communicated the letter to Mr. Howard, he represented it to me in ajuster point of view; tho' in reading it to himself I observed that he blushed indignant at the unfeeling hints with which the epistle is interspersed.
                  I ought to consider, he said, that the obligation of soliciting this annuity was inferior to the claims, which in my pre-sent situation justice alone, independent of humanity, gave me upon my relations; and that as an acquittal of the great debt owing me from their kindness and atten-tion, this salary had doubtless been pro-cured, which was evidently designed to extinguish all future expectations.
                  As Mr. Howard perceived however that I was vexed and ashamed, and as

yet undetermined how to act, delicacy made him forbear any other advice on the subject than merely that which I had at first solicited and which naturally re-sulted from reading the letter; and as my happiness and advantage were the sole ideas that dictated his sentiments, he thought these acquirements would not readily be the production of a measure which even in prospect gave birth to such uneasiness. He therefore concluded, with a feeling peculiar to his disposition, it must be confessed that our good sister's notions of affluence are not the most ro-mantic in the world; therefore while she thought she possessed the power of pro-curing you what she herself esteems the chief good in life, and which no doubt bestows many valuable and rational gra-tifications, she scrupled not by what means the advantage was gained, tho' a little more delicacy exerted in the trans-action had probably given it a very diffe-rent

aspect to what it now wears. How-ever she meant all for the best, tho' it cannot be denied that to talk to her of ease, comfort, and compleat indepen-dence on forty or fifty pounds a year, is to present different shades of colour be-fore eyes whose organs have been from infancy impaired. Indeed the happy disposition that gives existence to such sentiments, is beyond, infinitely beyond the reach of adverse fortune; and is in itself a blessing which no worldly acqui-sitions can confer.
                  By praise so delicate, Mr. Howard la-boured to convince me, that however I should determine, his opinion should fol-low mine; and that if my resolution was to give way to pique, and to reject this seeming compromise with my family, he on his part should rather applaud than blame the spirit that induced me to refuse a favor, which, however otherwise advantageous, overwhelmed me with

mortification. Yet it was not difficult to discern, that he might be apt to consi-der my rejection as an absurdity to which false delicacy and offended pride alone gave rise; and when on the other hand I coolly reflected that my finances were by no means ascertained, that it was not quite impossible amidst the chapter of ac-cidents from which they had already suf-fered severely but that I might really one day become dependent on the worthy Mr. Howard and my sister, a situation I could indeed but ill brook, I resolved to conquer my reluctance and yield to ne-cessity; tho' my heart rose against my judgment, and had I been alone I should have indulged in tears, which indeed were not wholly restrained even in Mr. Howard's presence, at sight of the bill.
                  Oh! Sophia! what steps were to be taken here, in this most cruel of all cir-cumstances? â€”To return it instantly without doubt. But how conceal from

the generous donor that I was acquainted from whence it came. Since Mrs. Hin-don could not retain his secret, tho' so powerfully urged and intreated, how could I possibly flatter myself that she would pay greater regard to mine. I had no path to pursue that had not been attempted by him without success; how-ever on some plan I was obliged suddenly to determine. I therefore sat down to my bureau without loss of time to answer her letter.
                  I thanked her in terms warmer than were my feelings, tho' I fear my coldness will surprize her, for the interest and trouble she has taken in this business; but re-enclosed the bill, which I besought her to return to the right owner, informing him that even as her gift, I could not possibly prevail with myself to accept of it.
                  I have asked the favor of Mr. Howard to thank Mr. Roatsley by letter in his

            SOPHIA.
            BY Mrs. CHARLOTTE LENNOX.
         
         
            

            SOPHIA.
            
               
                  CHAP. XVIII. Harriot's Artifices produce the desired Effect on the unsuspecting Sophia.
               WHEN they arrived at Mrs. Lawson's, Sophia, who lit-tle expected such a visit, had wandered, as usual, in the wood, accompanied with Dolly: Mrs. Lawson immediately sent Fanny in search of her: and Harriot, expres-sing an impatience to see her sister, went along with her.
               They found Sophia sitting under an oak, with Mrs. Gibbons on one

who beckoned to him. Sir Charles saw at once his Sophia, and the fatal sign, which planted a thou-sand daggers in his heart. Tremb-ling and pale he leaned against a tree, which concealed him from view, and saw her advance towards his ri-val, saw her in earnest discourse with him; and, to compleat his distrac-tion and despair, saw the happy youth throw himself at her feet, doubtless to thank her for the sacri-fice she made to him of a richer lover.
               Such was the inference he drew from this action; and now rage and indignation succeeding to grief, in these first transports, he was upon the point of discovering himself, and sacrificing the hated youth to his vengeance; but a moment's re-flection shewed him the dishonour of a contest with so despicable a ri-val, and turned all his resentment

about in an adjacent field, whose air and mien had a great resemb-lance of the youth whom he had seen in the inn. Sir Charles, eager to satisfy his doubts, followed him at a distance, and the youth turning again his wishing eyes towards the house, the baronet had a full view of his face.
               At the sight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his breast: he hastily retreated be-hind a hedge, determined to watch his motions; for he imagined, and with reason, that he came there to meet his mistress; and who that mi-stress was, whether Sophia, or the curate's daughter, was the distract-ing doubt, which he now expected to have satisfied.
               He walked along by the side of the hedge, still keeping William in sight, who suddenly turning back, rather flew than ran to meet a wo-man

who beckoned to him. Sir Charles saw at once his Sophia, and the fatal sign, which planted a thou-sand daggers in his heart. Tremb-ling and pale he leaned against a tree, which concealed him from view, and saw her advance towards his ri-val, saw her in earnest discourse with him; and, to compleat his distrac-tion and despair, saw the happy youth throw himself at her feet, doubtless to thank her for the sacri-fice she made to him of a richer lover.
               Such was the inference he drew from this action; and now rage and indignation succeeding to grief, in these first transports, he was upon the point of discovering himself, and sacrificing the hated youth to his vengeance; but a moment's re-flection shewed him the dishonour of a contest with so despicable a ri-val, and turned all his resentment

against Sophia, who having quitted her supposed lover, took her way back again to the house. Sir Charles followed her with disordered haste, resolved to load her with reproaches for her inconstancy: then, unwil-ling to gratify her pride by such an acknowledgment of his weakness, he turned back, cursing love, wo-men, and his own ill fate. In this temper he wandered about a long time; at last he again returned to the inn, where, after having given orders to have his horses got ready, he wrote that letter to Mr. Herbert, in which he so well disguised the an-guish of his heart, that the good old man believed his breaking off the af-fair was the effect of his lightness and inconstancy only, though Sophia's quicker penetration easily discovered the latent jealousy that had dictated it.
               Sir Charles ordered his servant to

deliver the letter into Mr. Herbert's hands; then mounting his horse, he bid him follow him as soon as he had executed his commission. The young baronet, who retired to his country seat to conceal his me-lancholy, and fondly flattered him-self that he should soon overcome that fatal passion which had been the source of so much disgust to him, found his mind so cruelly tortured with the remembrance of Sophia, that he reassumed his first design of going abroad, and unfortunately set out for Dover the day before Mr. Herbert's arrival.
               The good old man being obliged to send Sophia this bad news, filled his letter with tender consolations, and wise and prudent cousnels: he exorted her to bear this stroke of fortune with that dignity of patience which distinguishes the good and wise.
               
                  

                  The virtue of prosperity, said he, is temperance, the virtue of ad-versity fortitude; it is this last which you are now called upon to exert, and which the innocence of your life may well inspire you with: for be assured, my dear child, that it is the greatest con-solation under misfortunes to be conscious of having always meant well, and to be convinced that nothing but guilt deserves to be considered as a severe evil.
               
               Sophia in her answer displayed a mind struggling against its own ten-derness, offering up its disappointed hopes, its griefs, and desires, in pi-ous sacrifice to the will of Provi-dence, and seeking in religion all its consolation and support.
               
                  Can a virtuous person, said she, however oppressed by poverty, and in consequence neglected by the world, be said to want friends

and comforters who can look into his own mind with modest appro-bation, and to whom recollection furnishes a source of joy? Every good action he has performed is a friend, every instance of pious resignation is a comforter, who cheer him with present peace, and support him with hopes of future happiness. Can he be said to be alone, and deprived of the plea-sures of society, who converses with saints and angels? is he without distinction and reward whose life his almighty Creator approves?
               
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXVII. Sophia meets with a new Subject of Affliction.
               THE loss of Sir Charles hav-ing clouded all Sophia's views of happiness, she earnestly intreated Mr. Herbert's permission to settle herself in that humble sta-tion to which Providence seemed to call her; and as she believed Mrs. Gibbons might be very useful to her upon this occasion, she resolved to apply to her as soon as she had his answer.
               Notwithstanding all her endea-vours to bear this shock of fate with patience, a fixed melancholy took possession of her mind, con-vinced that Sir Charles had loved her; and that, by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances, he

had been prevented from giving her the utmost proof of his affection; her tenderness no longer combat-ted by suspicions to his prejudice, gained new force every day, and all his actions now appeared to her in a favourable point of view: so true it is, that when a person is found less guilty than he is suspected, he is concluded more innocent than he really is.
               Mr. Herbert, after a long silence, at length acquainted her, that he was ill, and desired her not to leave Mr. Lawson's till she heard further from him.
               The shortness of this billet, the trembling hand with which it ap-peared to be written, filled Sophia with the most dreadful apprehen-sions. Sir Charles was now forgot, and all her thoughts were taken up with the danger of her worthy friend: she determined to go to

him; and although Mr. Lawson and his wife endeavoured to dis-suade her from taking such a jour-ney, and William, urged by Dol-ly, and his own eagerness to serve her, offered to go and bring her an exact account of the state of his health, yet her purpose remained unalterable.
               "My dear benefactor is ill," said she,
and has none but strangers about him; it is fit that I should go and attend him;
and if I must lose him, pursued she,
bursting into tears, it will be some comfort to me to reflect that I have done my duty.
               
               She set out early the next morn-ing in the stage-coach: Dolly wept at parting, and engaged her lover to attend Sophia to her jour-ney's end; that if Mr. Herbert should be worse than they appre-hended,

side of her, and Dolly on the other; for the old gentlewoman was pre-vailed upon by Sophia to endure the company of the innocent girl, who had never offended her; and Dolly, instructed by her lovely friend, made good use of these opportunities to recover her favour.
               William leaned on a branch close by Sophia, to whom he addressed his discourse, while his eyes often stole tender glances at his beloved Dolly. Harriot, when she approached, cried out affectedly,
Upon my word, sister, you have a brilliant assem-bly here; I did not expect to find you in such good company.
               
               Sophia, surprised to see her sister, ran hastily to meet her, and embrac-ing her kindly, enquired with a sweet anxiety for her mother, and whether she also had been so good as to visit her. Harriot scarce answered her ques-tion; her attention was all fixed upon

he might be near to assist and comfort her.
               Sophia, when she saw him rid-ing by the side of the coach, at-tempted to persuade him to re-turn; but William charmed to have an opportunity of expressing his zeal for her service, would not quit her; and her spirits being too weak to contest this point with him, she was obliged to suffer his attendance.
               They reached the place where Mr. Herbert was, in the even-ing of the third day: he had taken lodgings at the house of a farmer, where he was attended with great tenderness and care.
               Sophia appeared with so deep a concern upon her countenance, and enquired for him with such extreme emotion, that the good woman of the house concluding

she was his daughter, thought it necessary before she answered her questions, to preach patience and submission to her, wisely observing, that we are all mortal, and that death spares nobody, from the squire to the plough-man.
               She ran on in this manner till she perceived Sophia grow pale, and close her eyes: she had just time to prevent her from falling, and with William's assistance, placed her in a chair, where while she applied remedies to recover her from her swoon, the youth with tears in his eyes, asked her softly, how long Mr. Herbert had been dead.
               "Dead!" repeated the farmer's wife,
who told you he was dead? no, no, it is not so bad as that neither.
               
               
                  
William rejoiced to hear this, and as soon as Sophia shewed some signs of returning life, he greeted her with the welcome news. She cast a look full of doubt and anguish upon the countrywoman, who confirmed his report, and offered to go with her to the gentleman's room. Sophia instantly found her strength return; she followed her with trembling haste; and, lest her presence should surprise Mr. Herbert, she directed the good woman to tell him, that a friend of his was come to see him.
               She heard him answer in a weak voice, but with some emo-tion,
It is my dear child, bring her to me.
               
               Sophia immediately appeared, and throwing herself upon her

knees at his bed-side, burst into tears, and was unable to speak.
               The good old man holding one of her hands prest in his, tender-ly blamed her for the trouble she had given herself in coming so far to visit him; but acknow-ledged at the same time, that this instance of her affection was ex-tremely dear to him, and that her presence gave him inexpressi-ble comfort.
               Sophia entered immediately upon the office of a nurse to her bene-factor, and performed all the duties of the most affectionate child to the best of parents.
               Mr. Herbert employed the little remaining strength he had in en-deavours to comfort her, and in pious exhortations.
Weep not for me, my dear child,
would he say,
but rather rejoice that

the innocence of my life has divested death of his terrors, and enabled me to meet him with calm resignation, and with humble hope. At this awful hour, how little would it a-vail me, that I had been rich, that I had been great and powerful? but what comforts do I not feel from an unre-proving conscience? these com-forts every one has it in his power to procure: live virtuous then, my dear Sophia, that you may die in peace: how small is the difference between the longest and the shortest life! if its pleasures be few, its mi-ries are so likewise; how little do they enjoy whom the world calls happy! how little do they suffer whom it pronounces wretched! one point of fleeting

time past, and death reduces all to an equality. But the distinc-tion between virtue and vice, and future happiness and misery are eternal.
               
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXVIII. The Character of Mrs. Howard.
               SOPHIA had need of all the consolation she derived from her reflections on the virtue and piety of her friend, to enable her to bear the apprehensions of his approaching death with any degree of fortitude; but when she least expected it, his distemper took a favourable turn, and in a few days the most dangerous symptons were removed.
               The Bath waters being judged absolutely necessary for the entire re-establishment of his health, he resolved to go thither as soon as he had recovered strength enough to bear the journey.
               Sophia at his earnest desire con-sented to return to Mr. Lawson's,

and remain there till he came from Bath, but she would not quit him till he was able to take this jour-ney; and by the sweetness of her conversation, her tender assiduity, and watchful care, contributed so much towards his recovery, that he was soon in a condition to travel with safety.
               He accompanied her the first day's journey to Mr. Lawson's; and being met at the inn by this worthy friend and young William, he consigned his beloved charge to their care, and pursued his way to Bath.
               Sophia was received with great joy by Mrs. Lawson and her daugh-ters: Dolly hung a long time upon her neck in transports, and as soon as they were alone, informed her that Mrs. Gibbons and her mother were perfectly reconciled; that she had consented to her nephew's

marriage, and even shewed an im-patience to conclude it:
but I prevailed,
said she,
to have the ceremony delayed till you, my dear friend, could be pre-sent; for I could not think of being happy, while you to whom I owe all, was afflicted.
               
               Sophia embraced her tenderly, congratulated her upon her change of fortune, and gave many praises to her lover, to whom she acknow-ledged great obligations for his care and attention to her.
               Dolly's cheeks glowed with plea-sure while she heard her William commended by one whom she so much loved and revered.
               The young lovers were married a few days afterwards; and Sophiaâ–ª who had so earnestly endeavoured to bring about this union, and had suffered so much in her own interest by her solicitude concerning it, was

one of those to whom it gave the most satisfaction.
               Mean time Mr. Herbert conti-nued indisposed at Bath, and Sophia uneasy, lest in this increase of his expences, her residence at Mr. Lawson's should lay him under some difficulties, resolved to ease him as soon as possible of the charge of her maintenance: she explained her situation to Mrs. Gibbons, and re-quested her assistance in procuring her a place.
               Mrs. Gibbons expressed great tenderness and concern for her upon this occasion, and assured her she would employ all her interest in her service. She accordingly men-tioned her with great praise to a widow lady of a very affluent for-tune, who had established such a character for generosity and good-ness, that she hoped, if she could be induced to take Sophia under

William: so handsome a youth seemed worthy to feel the influence of her charms; and all the artillery of her eyes was instantly levelled against him. Having returned his respectful bow with an affected cour-tesy, and the fashionable toss of the head, she deigned to take some little notice of Mrs. Gibbons, and honour-ed Dolly with a careless glance, whose amiable figure, however, at-tracted a second look; and after ex-amining her with an inquisitive eye, she turned away with a little expres-sion of scorn in her countenance, and again attacked William, practising a thousand airs to strike him; all which he beheld with the utmost indifference.
               Sophia, being impatient to see her mother, took leave of Mrs. Gibbons; but Harriot, who had a new conquest in view, was unwilling to go so soon, professing herself inchanted with the

her protection her fortune would be made.
               Mrs. Howard, so was the lady called, no sooner heard that a young woman of merit, well born, and genteely educated was reduced to go to service for subsistence, than she exclaimed with great vehemence against the avarice and luxury of the rich and great, who either hoarded for their unthankful heirs, or lavished in expensive pleasures, those superfluous sums which ought to be applied to the relief of the indigent.
Oh that I had a for-tune,
cried she,
as large as my heart, there should not be one distressed person in the world! I must see this young lady Mrs. Gibbons, and I must do something for her. You have obliged me infinitely by putting it in my power to gra-tify the unbounded benevolence

of my heart upon a deserving object.
               
               Mrs. Gibbons, when she related this conversation to Sophia, filled her with an extreme impatience to see the lady, not from any mean considerations of advantage to her-self, but admiration of so excellent a character. She accompanied Mrs. Gibbons in a visit to her at her country seat, which was but a few miles distant from the village where they lived; and Mrs. Howard was so pleased with her at this first interview, that she gave her an invitation to spend the remainder of the summer with her, and this in so obliging a manner, that Sophia immediately complied, not thinking it necessary to wait till she had consulted Mr. Herbert upon this offer, as she was fully persuaded he could have no objec-tions to her accepting it, Mrs.

Mrs. Howard being so considerable by her family and fortune, and so estimable by her character.
               This lady, who had made an early discovery of Sophia's economical talents, set her to work immediately after her arrival; her task was to embroider a white sattin negligee, which she undertook with great readiness, pleased at having an op-portunity of obliging a woman of so generous a disposition, and in some degree to requite her for her hospitality.
               Mrs. Howard indeed always pre-vented those on whom she conferred favours, from incurring the guilt of ingratitude; for she took care to be fully repaid for any act of benevo-lence; and having a wonderful art in extracting advantage to herself from the necessities of others, she sometimes sought out the unfortu-nate with a solicitude that did great

honour to her charity, which was sure to be its own reward. A few ostentatious benefactions had suffi-ciently established her character; and while her name appeared among the subscribers to some fashionable charity, who could suspect that her table was served with a parsimony which would have disgraced a much smaller fortune; that her rents from her indigent tenants were exacted with the most unrelenting rigor, and the naked and hungry sent sigh-ing from her gate?
               It has been well observed that what is called liberality is often no more than the vanity of giving, of which some persons are fonder than of what they give. But the vanity of giving publicly is most prevailing; and hence it happens, that those who are most celebrated for their charity, are in reality least sensible to the feelings of humanity: and

the same persons from whom the most affecting representation of pri-vate distress could not force the least relief, have been among the first to send their contributions to any new foundation.
               Sophia knew not how to recon-cile many circumstances in Mrs. Howard's conduct with her general professions of benevolence and ge-nerosity; but that lady had been so used to disguise herself to others; that at last she did not know herself; and the warmth and vehemence with which she delivered her senti-ments imposed almost as much up-on herself as her hearers.
               Sophia's amiable qualities how-ever soon produced their usual ef-fects, and inspired Mrs. Howard with as much friendship for her as so interested a temper was capable of. She wished to see her fortune established, and was very desirous of

serving her as far as she could, con-sistent with her prudent maxims which were to make other persons the source of those benefits, the merit of which she arrogated to her-self.
               Chance soon furnished her with an opportunity of exerting her ta-lents in favour of Sophia, and of engaging, as she conceived, her eternal gratitude. A country lady of her acquaintance coming one day to visit her, with her son, a clown-ish ignorant youth, Mrs. Howard was encouraged by the frequent glances he gave Sophia, to form a scheme for marrying her to him; and in this she foresaw so many pos-sible advantages to herself from So-phia's grateful disposition, that she pursued it with the most anxious so-licitude.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXIX. Mrs. Howard is taken in her own snare.
               MR. Barton, so was the young squire called, having con-ceived a liking for Sophia, repeated his visits frequently, emboldened by Mrs. Howard's civilities, who took every occasion of praising Sophia, and insinuating that he would be extremely happy in such a wife.
               She sometimes left him alone with Sophia, in hopes that he would declare his passion to her: but the rustic, awed by the dignity of her person and manners, durst not even raise his eyes to look on her; so that Mrs. Howard, finding the affair did not advance so fast as she wished, rallied Sophia upon her ill-timed reserve, and hinted her

views in her favour, which she con-sidering as an effect of her friend-ship, listened with respect, and even gratitude, though her heart refused to concur in them.
               This conversation passed in the presence of Mrs. Howard's only son, a youth about nineteen, who had come from the university to pass a few days with his mother. As soon as she quitted Sophia, he approach-ed her, and, with a look of tender-ness and concern, told her,
He was sorry to find his mother so zealous an advocate for Mr. Bar-ton, who could not possibly de-serve her.
               
               "Nor can I possibly deserve him," replied Sophia with a smile;
he is too rich.
               
               
                  Love only and merit can de-serve you,
resumed the young student, sighing,
and if love were

merit, I know one who might â€”hopeâ€”
               
               He paused and hesitated, and So-phia, to whom the language of love in any mouth but Sir Charles's was odious, suddenly quitted him, to avoid the continuance of a discourse which she considered as mere un-meaning gallantry.
               Mean time, her rustic lover not having courage enough to declare his passion to her, had recourse to the indulgence of his mother, who till that time had never refused any of his desires.
               He told her that he never liked any young woman so well in his life as Mrs. Sophia Darnley; and that he was sure she would make a good wife, because Mrs. Howard had told him so, and encouraged him to break his mind to her, but he was ashamed: he declared he

would marry no body else, and begged his mother to get her for him.
               Mrs. Barton, full of rage against her neighbour, for thus endeavour-ing to ensnare her son into a mar-riage, as she conceived unworthy of him, resolved to go to her, and load her with reproaches. While her chariot was getting ready, she con-tinued to question her son, and heard a great many particulars from him, which convinced her that his affections were more deeply engag-ed than she had imagined.
               After ordering the young squire to be locked up till her return, she flew to Mrs. Howard, and, with the most violent transports of rage, upbraided her with the treacherous part she had acted, by seducing her son into a liking for a poor crea-ture, who was a dependent upon

place, and declaring she would turn shepherdess.
               Sophia told her, smiling, that she was sure that sort of life would not please her.
               "Oh! how can you think so," cried Harriot,
is not the dress ex-cessively becoming? then love in these woods is so tender and sin-cere! I will engage there is not a nymph in this hamlet whose frown would not drive her lover to despair: own the truth now,
said she, turning with a lively air to William,
are you not violently in love?
               
               The youth bowed, blushed, and sighed; and not daring to look at his mistress, he suffered his eyes, full as they were of tender expression, to di-rect their glances towards Sophia. "I am proud to own, madam," said he to Harriot,
that I have a heart capable of the most ardent passion.
               
               
                  

her charity, and whom she took this method to get rid of.
               Mrs. Howard, who held Mrs. Barton in great contempt, on ac-count of her ignorance, and valued herself extremely upon her philo-sophic command over her passions, listened with an affected calmness to all Mrs. Barton's invectives; and when she found she had railed her-self out of breath, she began to declaim in a solemn accent against avarice, and that vile sordid dispo-sition of parents, who, in the mar-riage of their children, preferred the dross of riches to the real treasures of wisdom and virtue. She very charitably lamented Mrs. Barton's want of discernment, and littleness of mind; and concluded that Miss Sophia's merit rendered her deserv-ing of a husband even more con-siderable than Mr. Barton.
               
                  

                  Then marry her to your own son,
replied Mrs. Barton, with a sneer;
no doubt but he will be more worthy of her.
               
               
                  If my son should declare a pas-sion for Miss Sophia,
resumed Mrs. Howard,
it would soon be seen how far my sentiments are exalted above yours.
               
               "I am glad to hear this," re-turned Mrs. Barton,
for I am very sure Mr. Howard is in love with this wonderful creature whom you praise so much; and since you are so willing to make her your daughter-in-law, I shall be under no fear of my son's marrying her.
               
               Mrs. Howard, at this unexpected stroke, turned as pale as death, and, with a faultering voice, asked her,
What reason she had for sup-posing her son was in love with Miss Sophia?
               
               
                  
Mrs. Barton, who enjoyed her perplexity and confusion, suffered her to repeat her questions several times, and then maliciously referred her to the young gentleman him-self, "Who," said she,
upon finding you so favourably dis-posed, will, I doubt not, be ready enough to own his inclina-tions.
               
               Mrs. Howard was now so far humbled, that she condescended to to intreat Mrs. Barton to tell her what she knew of this affair.
               "All my information," said Mrs. Barton,
comes from my son, to whom Mr. Howard, considering him as his rival, declared his better right to the lady, as hav-ing first acquainted her with his passion.
               
               At this intelligence Mrs. How-ard's rage got so much the better of her prudence, that she uttered a

thousand invectives against the in-nocent Sophia, which drew some severe sarcasms from Mrs. Barton who being now fully revenged, rose up to be gone; but Mrs. Howard, sensible that a quarrel upon this oc-casion might have consequences very unfavourable to her reputation, seized her hand, and led her half reluctant, again to her chair, where after she had soothed her into good humour, by some flattering expres-sions, which coming from one of her acknowledged understanding, had great weight. She told her with the most unblushing confi-dence, that she was now convinced she had been deceived in the cha-racter of the young woman on whom she had with her usual gene-rosity conferred so many benefits.
I find to my inexpressible con-cern,
pursued she,
that this modest, sensible, and virtuous young

creature, as I once believed her, is in reality an artful hypocrite, whose only aim is to make her fortune, by ensnaring some unex-perienced youth into a marriage. Let us join our endeavours then, my dear Mrs. Barton, to preserve our sons from this danger: this is a common cause, all mothers are concerned in it; we will shew the young dissembler in her proper colours, and prevent her imposing upon others as she has done upon us.
               
               Mrs. Barton, who never carried her reflections very far, was so well pleased with Mrs. Howard's present behaviour, that she forgot all the past: these two ladies became on a sudden the best friends in the world, and this union was to be cemented with the ruin of Sophia's fame, such beginnings have certain female

friendships, and such are the leagues in which the wicked join.
               Mrs. Barton proposed to have her sent for into their presence, and af-ter reproaching her severely, dismiss her with contempt; but the more politic Mrs. Howard, whose views were at once to destroy Sophia's re-putation, and to secure her own, disapproved of this harsh treatment, as she called it, and charitably re-solved to ruin her with all possible gentleness.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXX. Sophia leaves Mrs. Howard.
               MRS. Howard accordingly wrote to Mrs. Gibbons, and acquainted her, that having disco-vered an intrigue carrying on be-tween Sophia and her son, she thought it necessary to dismiss her immediately out of her family; but that the poor young creature might be exposed as little as possible to censure, she begged she would come herself to fetch her away, and deli-ver her to her friends, with a cauti-on to watch her conduct carefully.
               She recommended secrecy to her for Sophia's sake; and assured her that if it had not been for this dis-covery of her bad conduct, she had resolved to have provided for her handsomely.
               
                  
Mrs. Gibbons, whom this letter threw into the utmost astonishment, immediately communicated the con-tents of it to Dolly and William, with whom she now lived.
               Dolly burst into tears of grief and indignation, and earnestly in-treated her to go immediately and take Miss Sophia out of a house where her merit was so little under-stood: but William, who looked farther into the consequences of this affair than either his wife or his aunt, believed it necessary for the justification of Sophia's honour, that Mr. Lawson should wait upon Mrs. Howard, and demand an ex-planation of those censures which she had cast upon a young lady con-fided to his care; rightly judging, that if malice was the source of her accusation, she would not dare to pursue it with a man of his charac-ter; and if it arose from the infor-mation

of others, he would be able to detect the falshood of it.
               These reasons prevailed with Mrs. Gibbons, who had been very desirous to shew her eloquence upon this occasion, and was resolved, she said, not to have spared Mrs. Howard for her immature conclu-sions.
               William went immediately to his father-in-law, and acquainted him with what had happened. Mr. Lawson was grieved from the consi-deration of what Sophia's delicate sensibility would feel from such an attack upon her reputation; and this was the worst that he apprehended could happen from calumnies which the purity of her manners and the innocency of her life would be al-ways a sufficient refutation of. A wise and virtuous person, he knew, was out of the reach of fortune, though not free from the malice of it.

All attempts against such a one are, as the poet says, like the arrows of Xerxes; they may darken the day, but cannot stiflle the sun.
               His impatience to take Sophia out of the hands of a woman whom he conceived to be either very ma-licious, or very imprudent, made him defer his visit no longer than till the afternoon.
               When he sent in his name, Mrs. Howard, who had no suspicion of the occasion of his coming, ordered him to be shewn into a parlour, where she suffered him to wait near an hour before she admitted him to her pre-sence; a country curate being in her opinion a person too insignificant to lay claim to any degree of conside-ration, and besides, this sort of neglect being affected by many per-sons of quality, to whom it certainly gives great importance and dignity,
"And mighty constant too! no doubt," interrupted Harriot with a malignant sneer; for she had observ-ed the sigh and the look, and was ready to burst with vexation and dis-appointment, to find her conquest obstructed already by her sister, as she supposed; and being now as im-patient as she was before unwilling to be gone, "Come, Sophy," said she, taking her under the arm,
my mamma will take it ill that you make no more haste to see her, for we shall return to town immediately.
               
               "Sure you will stay one night," said Sophia.
               "Oh not for the world!" ex-claimed Harriot affectedly;
How can you imagine I would stay so long in an odious village, to be rusticated into aukwardness,
pur-sued she with a spiteful laugh,

their imitators never lose any op-portunity of exercising it.
               Mr. Lawson was at last summon-ed to the lady's dressing-room, where he expected to have found Sophia, but was glad to see Mrs. Howard alone. She asked him with a little superciliousness, if he had any business with her; to which he replied, with a solemnity in his look and accent that surprised her,
That being a friend to miss So-phia Darnley, and the person to whose care she was confided by her relations, he thought it his duty to enquire what part of her conduct had given occasion for those unfavourable suspicions which were entertained of her.
               
               "Mrs. Gibbons, madam," pur-sued he,
has communicated to me a letter which she has receiv-ed from you, wherein there is a heavy charge against miss Sophia;

a charge which none who know her can think it possible for her to deserve. There must cer-tainly be some mistake here, ma-dam; you have been misinform-ed, or appearances have deceived you, and in justice to you, as well as to one of the most vir-tuous and amiable young women in the world, I am resolved to trace the source of these calum-nies, that her innocence may be fully cleared. I beg of you then, madam, let me know what foundation you have for believ-ing that Miss Sophiaâ€”
               
               Mrs. Howard, whom this speech had thrown into great confusion, interrupted him here, to prevent his repeating those expressions in her letter, the meaning of which, though obvious, she durst not avow.
               "I find," said she,
that you and Mrs. Gibbons have seen this

affair in a worse light than I in-tended you should; my son has been foolish enough to entertain a liking for this girl, whom I took under my protection, with a view to provide for her hand-somely, and she has been wise enough,
pursued she, with an ironical smile,
to give him en-couragement, I suppose; but with all her excellencies, I am not disposed to make her my daugh-ter-in-law.
               
               Mrs. Howard threw in this last softening expression, in hopes it would satisfy Mr. Lawson, and ad-ded,
that to prevent any thing happening, which might be dis-agreeable to her, she begged he would take Sophia home with him.
               
               "Most willingly, madam," said he;
but since it seems to be your opinion, that this young gentle-woman

woman has encouraged the clan-destine addresses of your son, I think it will be proper to exa-mine first into the truth of these suspicions, that you may not part with worse thoughts of her than she deserves.
               
               Mrs. Howard being thus prest, and unwilling to enter into an ex-planation that would expose all her artifices, was forced to acknow-ledge that she had no other foun-dation for her fears than the pas-sion her son had owned for her; and having made this unwilling concession, she left him with a countenance inflamed with stifled rage, saying she would send Sophia to him.
               Accordingly she went into the room where she was at work, and told her, her friend the curate was waiting to carry her home. Ob-serving

her to look extremely sur-prised, "If you consider," said she,
what returns you have made me for the benefits I have conferred upon you, you will not think it strange that we should part in this manner.
               
               "Bless me," cried Sophia,
what have I done to deserve such re-proaches?
               
               
                  I cannot stay to talk to you now,
said Mrs. Howard;
I have explained myself to Mr. Lawson; I am sorry to say, that I now can only wish you well.
               
               She hurried out of the room when she had said this; and So-phia, in the utmost perplexity and concern, flew down stairs to Mr. Lawson, who was already at the gate waiting to help her into the chaise: she gave him her hand, ask-ing

him at the same time, with great emotion,
What Mrs. Howard accused her of?
               
               As soon as they drove away, Mr. Lawson related all that had past between that lady and him, which filled Sophia with new astonishment: she could not com-prehend Mrs. Howard's motives for acting in the manner she had done with regard to her; all her conduct appeared to her highly ex-travagant and inconsistent; she asked Mr. Lawson a thousand questions, full of that simplicity which ever accompanies real good-ness of heart.
               He gave her some notion of the dangerous character of Mrs. Howard, and greatly blamed her for having so suddenly accepted her invitation, without first consulting Mr. Herbert. "It is a maxim, pursued he,
of one of the wisest

of the antients, that in form-ing new connections of every sort, it is of great importance in what manner the first ap-proaches are made, and by whose hands the avenues of friendship are laid open.
               
               Mr. Lawson, by this hint, gave Sophia to understand, that he did not think Mrs. Gibbons a proper person to introduce her into the world. She was now sensible that she had been too precipitate; but her motives were so generous, that Mr. Herbert, whom in a let-ter she acquainted with the whole affair, easily justified her in his own opinion, though he earnestly recommended it to her not to let her apprehensions of being burthen-some to him draw her into new in-conveniencies.
               Mr. Lawson having, as he ima-gined, prevented Mrs. Howard

from making any future attack upon Sophia's reputation, by obliging her to acknowledge her innocence, was surprised to hear wherever he went, of the calumnies she invented against her.
               Nothing is more common than for persons to hate with extreme inveteracy those whom they have injured; and although Mrs. How-ard was convinced, that Sophia would not admit a visit from her son, (who now openly avowed his passion for her;) that she refused to receive his letters, and shun-ned every place where she thought it possible to meet him; yet pre-tending to be apprehensive that the youth would be drawn into a clan-destine marriage, she sent him away precipitately upon his travels, and this gave a colour to new invectives against Sophia, who trusting only to her innocence for her justification,

had the satisfaction to find that in-nocence fully acknowledged in the esteem and respect with which she was treated by all the persons of fashion in the neighbourhood.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXI. Sophia returns to Town, and hears news that reduces her to Despair.
               MR. Herbert, who in every new trial to which Sophia was ex-posed, found greater cause for admi-ration of her character, praised the gentleness and forgiving spirit which she discovered upon this occasion; but Mrs. Gibbons was not wholly satisfied with her conduct,
You ought to discriminate upon Mrs. Howard, said she, and tell the world how desirous she was to have you married to her friend's son, though she makes such a clutter about her own: indeed you want spirit, miss Sophia,
added the old lady, with a little contempt.
               
                  

                  and ashamed to shew my face in any assembly in town afterwards.
Saying this, she courtesied disdainfully to Mrs. Gibbons and her nephew, and tripped away, pulling her sister away with her.
               Dolly joined the two ladies, but walked by the side of Sophia, not aiming at any familiarity with the in-solent and affected Harriot; and as they pursued their way home, she had the mortification to hear her lover ridiculed and despised by the disap-pointed coquet, who supposed she mortified her sister by the contempt she expressed for a man who had so little taste as to like her.
               Sophia, as well in compassion to poor Dolly, who suffered greatly up-on this occasion, as in justice to the amiable youth, defended him warm-ly, which drew some coarse raillery upon her from Harriot.
               When they came near to Mr.

                  I am not of your opinion, ma-dam, replied Sophia; for in taking revenge upon our enemies, we are only even with them; in passing over their malice we are superior.
               
               
                  Well, well, interrupted Mrs. Gibbons, I have no notion of such superiousness: I always resent in-juries, and Mrs. Howard shall feel my resentment for her malice to you. I have not returned her last visit yet, and perhaps I may not this month; this is pretty severe I think.
               
               Sophia, composing her counte-nance as well as she could, thanked Mrs. Gibbons for this instance of her friendship to her; but she had no opportunity to observe whether she kept her word, for she was sum-moned to town by a letter from her mother, which gave her a melan-choly account of her affairs.
               Mrs. Darnley acquainted her that

the gentleman who paid her the an-nuity which Sir Charles had stipu-lated for her when he procured him her late husband's place, was dead. She desired her to come immediately to town to assist her under her mis-fortunes; and added in a postscript, as if reluctantly, that Harriot had left her, and was not so dutiful as she could w
                     â€¢
                  sh.
               Sophia read this letter with tears; and, impatient to comfort her af-flicted mother, she instantly prepared for her little journey.
               All Mr. Lawson's family parted from her with great regret; but Dolly's affliction was extreme, and Sophia amidst so many greater causes of sorrow, felt a new pang when she took leave of her tender and in-nocent friend.
               To spare Mr. Lawson the trouble of conducting her to town, she ac-cepted a place in the coach of a la-dy

with whom she had lately become acquainted, and who professed a particular esteem for her.
               On her arrival at her mother's house, she found only a servant there, who informed her that her mistress had taken lodgings at Kensington for the air, having been indisposed for some weeks past.
               Sophia ordered her to get a hack-ney coach to the door, and was hur-rying away without daring to en-quire for her sister, when the maid told her miss Darnley desired to see her before she went to Kensington.
               "Where is my sister," said So-phia, with a faultering accent.
               The answer she received was a stroke of fortune more cruel than any she had yet experienced: her sister, she found, lived in the house which Sir Charles had once offered to her.
               
                  
Trembling and pale she ordered the coachman to drive thither, and drawing up the windows, relieved her labouring heart with a shower of tears.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXII Which leaves Sophia in her former Perplexity.
               THE first thought that struck the amazed Sophia was, that Sir Charles, either following the motions of his natural inconstancy, or in revenge of her supposed con-tempt of him, had married Harriot. Certain that she had now lost for ever this lover, who with all his real or imputed faults, she had never been able to banish from her heart, she resigned herself up to the sharp-est agonies of despair, and had al-ready arrived at her sister's house be-fore she was able to stop the course of her tears.
               A servant in the livery of her own family opened the door. This cir-cumstance

surprised Sophia, who pulling her hat over her eyes to con-ceal her disorder, asked him, with some hesitation, if his mistress was at home.
               The fellow replied, he believed she was, and opening the coach-door, shewed her into a parlour, telling her, with a smart air, that he would enquire of his lady's wo-man whether she was visible yet or no.
               Sophia having summoned all her fortitude to enable her to go through this severe trial with dignity, had time enough to recollect and com-pose herself before any one appeared; and now several circumstances rush-ed upon her memory which, in the first transports of her astonishment and grief, had escaped her attention.
               Mrs. Darnley, in her letter, had not mentioned Harriot's marriage, but barely said she had left her. The

servant who delivered her message called her miss Darnley; and though she lived in a house that belonged to Sir Charles, yet it was scarcely suit-able to the quality of his wife.
               A few moments reflection upon these appearances made the generous Sophia change the object of her con-cern. The misfortune for which she had grieved so much, seemed light, compared with that she appre-hended: she wept no longer for the inconstancy of her lover; she trem-bled for the honour of her sister-; and her greatest fear now was, that Sir Charles was not married.
               While she was absorbed in these melancholy thoughts, Harriot's maid entered the room, who after glanc-ing over Sophia with a supercilious eye, (for she was very simply drest,) asked her,
If she had any business with her lady.
               
               
                  Tell her, replied Sophia, that her sister is here.
               
               
                  
The girl blushed, courtesied, and flew to acquaint her mistress; and Sophia was instantly desired to walk up stairs.
               She found Harriot in her dressing room, in an elegant dishabille, having just finished her morning's work, which appeared in a suit of ribbons made up with great taste.
               As soon as she saw Sophia, she rose from her chair, and saluted her with affected dignity; but at the same time with an air of embarrass-ment that encreased every moment: so that being unable to bear the sweet but penetrating looks of her sister, she resumed her work, alter-ing and unripping, without any ap-parent design, yet affecting to be extremely busy, and to shew how perfectly she was at ease, talked of the most trifling matters imaginable, while Sophia gazed on her in silent anguish, anxious to know the truth

of her situation, yet dreading to have it explained. At length she told her that she was going to Ken-sington to her mother, and desired to know if she had any message to send to her.
               Harriot suddenly interrupting her, as if she feared some further questi-ons, began to exclaim against her mother's unreasonable temper, say-ing, that she had offended her vio-lently only because she had it not in her power to comply with some very extravagant expectations which she had formed.
               
                  Sister, said Sophia, I am wholly ignorant of your affairs; I know not what cause of discontent you have given my mother, but I see there is a great alteration in your condition of life, and I hopeâ€”
               
               
                  What do you hope, pray Miss? interrupted Harriot, reddening: I suppose I am to have some of your

satirical flings; your temper is not altered I find.
               
               "Dear Harriot," resumed Sophia, with tears in her eyes (this causeless anger confirming her suspicions)
why do you reproach me with be-ing satirical? is it a crime to be anxious for your happiness?
               
               
                  I wish you would not trouble yourself about me, replied Harri-ot, I know best what will make me happy; you should not pre-tend to instruct your elders, miss Sophy; I am older than you; you know, you have often up-braided me with that.
               
               
                  Sister, said Sophia calmly, you desired to see me, have you any thing to say to me?
               
               
                  I know, answered Harriot, that I shall meet with ungrateful returns for my kindness; never-theless I shall act like a sister to-wards you, and it was to tell you

Lawson's house, the sight of Sir Charles's chariot threw her into a fit of trembling; Harriot perceived it, and, willing to undeceive her, if she hoped to find the young baro-net there,
I am charged with Sir Charles's compliments to you,
said she;
he insisted upon our using his chariot for this little excursion; my mamma and I would fain have persuaded him to accompany us, but he pleaded an engagement, and would not come.
               
               Dolly now looked with great con-cern upon her fair friend, who, sup-pressing a sigh, asked if Sir Charles was quite recovered.
               
                  I do not know that he has been ill,
replied Harriot.
Indeed when he came from Bath, the fatigue he had endured with his sick uncle, whom he had sat up with several nights before he

so that I wished to see you: I very much doubt whether, if you were in prosperity, you would do the same by me.
               
               
                  Have I behaved so ill in adver-sity then, said Sophia, that you form this hard judgment of me, Harriot?
               
               
                  Pray don't upbraid me with your behaviour, miss, said Har-riot; other people may have be-haved as well as you, though they are not prudes.
               
               
                  You say you are in prosperity, sister, said Sophia, but perhaps you and I have different notions of prosperity: let me know the truth of your situation, and if I find you happy according to my notions of happiness, you will soon be convinced that I can take a sister's share in it.
               
               "I am not obliged to give an "account of my conduct to you,

replied Harriot, who had listen-ed to this speech with great emo-tion;
and I must tell you, sister Sophia, that if you go on taking this liberty of questioning and censuring me, I shall not care how seldom I see you. As to my mother, I know that it is my du-ty to do every thing for her that is in my power; and this I have offered to do already.
               
               Saying this, she rang the bell, and her maid appearing, she gave her some orders which necessarily re-quired her attendance in the room; so that Sophia, finding she could have no further discourse with her sister, rose up and took leave of her with an aching heart. Her griefs all aggravated by the apprehension of her sister's dishonour, and the ha-tred which she felt for Sir Charles, as her seducer, struggling with a ten-der remembrance, her gentle bosom

was torn with conflicting passions, and she proved but too well the truth of that maxim, That philosophy easily triumphs over past and future evils, but the present triumph over her.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXIII. Contains an interesting Discovery.
               MRS. Darnley received her daughter with unusual ten-derness; she felt how much she stood in need of her filial care; and her behaviour was dictated by that interested kindness which only gives in expectation of receiving back doublefold.
               Sophia saw her pale and emaci-ated, and was greatly affected with the sight: she would not mention her sister, for fear of discomposing her; but Mrs. Darnley soon intro-duced the subject that was most in her thoughts, and exclaimed against Harriot's undutifulness and want of affection with the most violent trans-ports of passion.
               
                  

                  I have been the best of mo-thers to her,
said she, melting into tears;
I have always indul-ged her in all her wishes, and impaired my fortune to support her extravagancies, and how has she returned this kindness! Would you think it, my dear Sophy, though she is in affluent circum-stances, and I, by the loss of my annuity, am plunged into all my former distresses, she has re-fused to pay those debts which I contracted during the time she lived with me; and thinks it suf-ficient to invite me to reside in her house, where, no doubt, I should feel my dependence se-verely.
               
               "Sir Charles," said Sophia sigh-ing,
does not act with his usual generosity; if he has married my sister, why does he suffer you to be in distress.
               
               
                  
"Married your sister!" repeated Mrs. Darnley, in astonishment.
               "Ah, madam," resumed Sophia,
is she not married then to Sir Charles?
               
               
                  Why, is it possible that you can wish him to be married to Harriot?
said Mrs. Darnley.
               "Alas!" cried Sophia,
ought I not to wish it, when I see her in his house?
               
               "Oh," resumed Mrs. Darnley,
I perceive your mistake; but that house is not Sir Charles's now; Lord Lâ€” bought it of him, with the furniture, some time ago; it might have been yours, and without any offence to your virtue tooâ–ª yet you thought fit to refuse it: but I will not pretend to reprove one so much wiser than myselfâ€”
               
               "Well, madam," interrupted So-phia eagerly,
then it is not to Sir

Charles that my sister is married, to whom is she married?
               
               
                  You have seen her, have you not?
said Mrs. Darnley, looking a little confused.
               "I have indeed seen her," said Sophia,
but she did not explain her situation to me.
               
               "And do you imagine," re-sumed Mrs. Darnley, peevishly,
that she would be less reserved with her mother? and if she was afraid of telling you the truth, is it likely she would own it to me?
               
               
                  Then I fear it is bad indeed with Harriot,
cried Sophia, in a melancholy accent,
since she has so much to conceal from a mother and a sister.
               
               
                  You were always censorious, Sophy,
said Mrs. Darnley, with some passion;
for my part, I am resolved to think the best.

If Lord Lâ€”is married pri-vately to your sister, her charac-ter will one day be cleared to the world, and she thinks no pru-dent person can blame her, for chusing to bear for a time a few undeserved censures, rather than to struggle with poverty and con-tempt.
               
               Sophia, now convinced of Har-riot's unhappy conduct, burst into tears. Mrs. Darnley, after looking at her in silence a moment, said, with some confusion;
Then you do not believe your sister is mar-ried, Sophy?
               
               "Ah, madam," replied Sophia,
you do not say that you know she is, and whatever reasons there might be for concealing her mar-riage from the world, certainly there are none for hiding it from you.â€”In vain,
added she, with still greater emotion,
would your

parental tenderness seek to de-ceive yourself.
               
               
                  Reproach me no more with my tenderness for your sister,
interrupted Mrs. Darnley, angrily;
I am too much affected with her ingratitude already.
               
               "I am sorry she is ungrateful," said Sophia;
but, oh! my dear mamma, it is not fit you should accept of her assistance.
               
               "I hope," said Mrs. Darnley, casting down her eyes,
that I know what to do as well as my daughter.â€”But Sophy,
added she, after a little pause,
I am sorry to tell you, if you do not know it already, that if you have still any thought of Sir Charles, you deceive yourself; I am very well informed, that a match has been proposed to him, and he has given so favourable an answer

that it is expected the marriage will be concluded, as soon as he comes from Paris: I heard it all from one of the young lady's relations.
               
               This was a severe stroke to poor Sophia, who had just begun to breathe again, after the anguish she had suffered, in the belief that Sir Charles had forsaken her for her sister, and added perfidy and baseness to his inconstancy.
               Mrs. Darnley, who saw her grow pale, and her eyes swimming in tears, while she struggled to con-ceal her emotions, could not help being affected with her distress, and endeavoured to console her.
               Sophia, more softened by this tenderness, suffered her tears to flow a few moments unrestrained; then suddenly wiping her charm-ing eyes,
Pardon this weakness,

died, made him look a little pale and thin; but he is now ex-tremely well, and more gay than ever: and it is well he is so,
pursued she,
for we have so much of his company, that if he was was not entertaining, we should find him very troublesome.
               
               All this was daggers to the heart of poor Sophia: those pleasing ideas which she had indulged upon read-ing her mother's letter, that repre-sented Sir Charles as having suffer-ed in his health, from his endea-vours to vanquish his passion for her, now vanished, and left in their room a sad conviction that she was become wholly indifferent to him.
               She might indeed, knowing her sister's malice, have attributed what she said to artifice; but her manner of accounting for the alteration in Sir Charles's looks, which her fond fancy had dwelt upon so much, was

madam,
said she,
this indeed is not a time to weep for myself, your sorrows claim all my tears.
               
               
                  Aye, I have sorrows enough, Heaven knows,
said Mrs. Darn-ley,
my debts unpaid, my annuity gone, what have I to trust to?
               
               "Providence," interrupted So-phia,
your piety and my industry. Alas! my dear mamma, your greatest affliction is not the loss of your annuity, or the debts with which you are encumbered, it is my sister's unhappy fall from virtue. That parent,
pursued she,
who sees a beloved child become a prey to licentious pas-sions, who sees her publicly in-cur shame and reproach, expel-led the society of the good and virtuous, and lead a life of dis-honour embittered with the con-tempt

of the world, and the se-cret upbraidings of her own con-science; that parent can best judge of your anguish now: I have only a sister's feelings for this misfortune! but these feelings are strong enough to make me very unhappy.
               
               Mrs. Darnley appeared so much moved with this discourse, that So-phia pursued it, till she brought her mother to declare, that she would rather suffer all the inconve-niencies of poverty, than give a sanc-tion to Harriot's guilt, by partaking of its reward.
               Sophia, to relieve her anxiety, laid down a plan for their future subsistence, and proved to her, that by her skill in several little useful arts, it would be easy for her to supply her with all the necessaries of life.
We

will first,
said she, "pay your "debts.
               "How is that to be done?" said Mrs. Darnley hastily.
               "The furniture of your house," said Sophia,
the plate, and other pieces of finery, which Sir Charles Stanley presented to you, will, if converted into money, not only pay your debts, but provide a little fund for present expences, and a reserve for future exigencies; mean while, my in-dustry and care will, I hope, keep want far from you. I have friends, who will find employ-ment for my little talents; and if I can but make your life easy and comfortable, I shall think myself happy.
               
               Mrs. Darnley, with tears in her eyes, embraced her daughter, bid her dispose of every thing as she

pleased, and assured her she would endeavour to bear her new condition of life with patience and resignation.
               Sophia immediately wrote to a gentleman of the law, who had been an intimate friend of her father's; and he undertook to manage their little affairs in town. A few days afterwards he brought them a hundred pounds, which was all that remained from the sale, after every demand upon Mrs. Darnley was paid.
               She read over the accounts with great emotion, bitterly regretting every trinket she had parted with, and told Sophia, that it was absolutely neces-sary they should settle in some village near town, for she could not bear the thoughts of ex-posing

her poverty, to her acquain-tance, and of being seen in a worse condition than for-merly.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXIV. Sophia continues to act romanticly, and Harriot like a Woman who knows the World.
               SOPHIA, who thought her mother's declining health a bet-ter reason for not residing in Lon-don, hired in an adjacent village, at a very small rent, a little house, or rather cottage, so neat, and situ-ated so happily, that an imaginati-on lively as hers was, and a little romantick, could not fail of being charmed with it. To this place she removed her books, and being provided by her friend Dolly with an innocent country girl for a ser-vant, she conducted her mother to her rural abode, and had the satis-faction to find her pleased with it, novelty having always charms for

her, and here for a few days, it supplied the place of those other gratifications to which she had been accustomed.
               In the midst of these cares, So-phia did not forget her unhappy sis-ter: she wrote several letters to her, in which she employed all the power of virtuous eloquence to bring her to a sense of her errors, but in vain.
               Harriot did not deign to answer her, but in a letter to her mother, she complained of the injurious treatment she received from Sophia, and earnestly intreated her to leave her sister, and reside with her.
               Although Mrs. Darnley refused this offer with seeming steadiness, yet her discontent was but too apparent. A life of retirement, which often obliged her to seek in herself, those resources against lan-guor

and melancholy, which she used to find in the dissipations of the town, could not be grateful to one who had never accustomed her-self to reflection, whose mind was filled with trifles, and its whole stock of ideas derived from dress, cards, and every other fashionable folly.
               To be capable of enjoying a ru-ral life, there is something more necessary than a good understand-ing: innocence and purity of man-ners must contribute to give a re-lish to pleasures, which are found-ed in reason, virtue, and piety.
               Hence it was, that Sophia, in the bloom of youth, found happiness in the solitude of a village, while her mother, in a declining age, panted after the vanities of the town.
               In vain did Mr. Herbert fill the letters he wrote to Mrs. Darnley, with maxims of morality and pious

admonitions; he experienced here the truth of that observation, that it is a work of great difficulty to dispossess vice from a heart, where long possession seems to plead pre-scription.
               Sophia, who knew her mother's taste for living at ease, that she might be able to gratify it, applied herself diligently to her work, which was a piece of embroidery, that had been bespoke by a benevolent lady, in order to give her present employment; and, by exhibiting it as a proof of her ingenuity, to pro-cure her more. She likewise exer-cised her invention in drawing little designs for fan-mounts; and always chose such subjects as conveyed some moral lesson to the mind, while they pleased the imagination.
               Some of these drawings were dis-posed of, by the lady her friend, so advantageously, that Sophia was

encouraged to pursue her labour; and Mrs. Darnley, flattered by the prospect of more easy circumstances, began to enlarge her scheme of ex-pence, made little excursions about the country in a post-chaise, talked of hiring a better house, and of passing two months at least in Lon-don during the winter.
               Mean time Harriot became more earnest in solicitations to her mother, to come and live with her; her si-tuation began to be so generally suspected, that she was in danger of being wholly neglected.
               She wrote to her in a strain of tenderness and duty, that revived all the ill-judging parent's affection, who invited her to make her a visit in her little retreat, and promised her a favourable reception even from Sophia herself.
               Sophia was indeed far from op-posing this visit; she was rather desi-rous

so natural, and so full of probabi-lity, that she could expect no arti-fice there.
               Every thing Harriot said was con-firmed by facts, which left no room for doubt: his assiduity to Harriot, his neglect of her, appeared but too plain. Did he not lend his chariot for a visit in which he would not share? Did he not send his com-pliments in a manner that shewed his heart was so much at ease, that he felt not even any resentment for her leaving him? Could there be stronger proofs of indifference than these?
               Such were her thoughts, and her heart was so oppressed by this sud-den and unexpected shock, that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears. Dolly, who looked at her with tender anxiety, and saw her colour come and go, and her charming eyes bent on the ground, as if she

of drawing her sister thither frequently, with a hope that her example and her arguments might one day influence her to change her conduct.
               Harriot received this invitation with joy; for such was the depra-vity of her mind, that she exulted in having an opportunity of dis-playing the grandeur of her dress, and equipage to her sister; to her who had made virtuous poverty her choice, and shewn that she despised riches, when they were to be pur-chased by guilt. The pride of hu-man nature (says an eminent writer) takes its rise from its corruption, as worms are produced by putrefac-tion.
               
               The wretched fallen Harriot was proud! the diamonds that glittered in her hair, the gilt chariot, and the luxurious table; these monuments of her disgrace contributed to keep

up the insolence of a woman, who by the loss of her honour was lower than the meanest of her servants, who could boast of an uncorrupted virtue.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXV. Harriot visits her mother in her Cottage.
               SOPHIA was busily employed upon her embroidery, when Harriot, from her gay chariot, alighted at her door; she entered that humble abode of innocence and industry, in a kind of triumph, and accosted her sister with a haughty expression of superiority in her looks and air, as if she expected the splendor of her appearance should strike her with awe.
               Sophia received her with the modest dignity of conscious virtue; and Harriot, tho' incapable of much reflection, yet soon perceiv-ed the miserable figure she made, in the presence of such a charac-ter, and stood silent and abashed,

while Sophia contemplated her finery with an eye of pity and of anguish.
               Harriot, at length recovering herself, asked for her mother, who that moment entered the room. The sight of her daughter's equi-page, had thrown her into an a-greeable flutter of spirits, and she readily pardoned the fine lady, all the faults of the ungrateful child.
               Harriot, emboldened by so kind a reception, proposed to her to ac-company her to town, promising to make her abode with her a-greeable, by every instance of duty and affection.
               Mrs. Darnley blushed, and was silent. Sophia fixed her eyes upon her mother, anxious and impatient for her answer; she cast a timid glance at Sophia: she read in her speaking eyes her sentiments of this proposal; and turning to Har-riot,

she told her faintly, that not being satisfied with her conduct, it would be very improper for her to countenance it, by residing with her.
               Harriot burst into tears, and ex-claimed against her sister's malice, who, she said, acted like her most cruel enemy, and sought to ruin her character, by estranging herself from her company, and preventing her mother from taking notice of her.
               Sophia, with great gentleness, proved to her, that the loss of her reputation was the necessary con-sequence of her living in a manner unsuitable to her circumstances; that her mother and her, by com-plying with her request, could not preserve her from censure, but would incur it themselves.
               "You call me cruel, Harriot," said she,
for estranging myself from your company; but consi-der

a little, whether it is not you that are both cruel and un-just. Why would you deprive me of the only reward the world bestows on me, for a life of vo-luntary poverty; you have ex-changed a good name for dress and equipage; and I, to preserve one, subject myself to labour and indigence: you enjoy your pur-chase; but I should lose mine, were I to have that complaisance for you which you require. Leave me my reputation then, since it is the sole recompence of those hardships to which I wil-lingly submit; and if you wish to recover yours, be contented to be poor like me.
               
               Sophia, finding her sister listened to her, tho' it was sullenly, and with down-cast eyes, expatiated in a tender manner upon the errors of her conduct, and the fatal con-sequences

that were likely to fol-low.
               Harriot at length interrupted her, with a pert air, and said,
She would not be taught her duty by her younger sister;
then turning to her mother,
I hope, madam,
said she,
my sister will not have so much power with you, as to make you forbid my coming here.
               
               She put her handkerchief to her eyes, as she said this; to which Mrs. Darnley replied, with great vehemence,
That no person on earth should ever prevail upon her to cast off her child.
               
               Sophia was silent, and observing that her presence seemed to lay them under some restraint, she rose up, to retire to her work, telling her sister, as she passed by her "That far from hindering "her visits, she would rather en-courage

her to repeat them often,
that she might be convinced it was possible, to be happy in a cottage.
               
               Harriot laughed, and muttered the words romantick and affecta-tion, which Sophia took no no-tice of, but left her at liberty to converse freely with her mother.
               Mrs. Darnley talked to her at first in a chiding strain, and af-fected to assume the authority of a parent; but, a slave to her appe-tites, she could not resist any op-portunity of gratifying them; and Harriot found it no difficult mat-ter to force a present upon her, to supply those expences which her extravagance, and not her wants, made necessary.
               Harriot now came often to the village, and gave it out, that she was upon the best terms imagina-ble with her mother and sister, not

doubting but the world would cease to suspect her, since Sophia approv-ed her conduct.
               The frequency and the length of her visits made Sophia entertain hopes of her reformation, since the time she spent with her mo-ther, was taken from that dan-gerous and immoral dissipation, which forms the circle of what is called a gay life. For it is with our manners as with our health; the abatement of vice is a degree of virtue, the abatement of disease is a degree of health.
               Mr. Herbert being perfectly re-covered, filled Sophia with extreme joy, by the account he sent her of it, and of his resolution to come and live near her.
               While she impatiently expected his arrival, and sent many a long-ing look towards the road, near which her little cottage was si-tuated,

she one day saw a gentle-man ride by full speed, who in his person and air had a great resem-blance to Sir Charles Stanley. Her heart, by its throbbing emotion, seemed to acknowledge its con-queror; for poor Sophia was still in love: she loved, though she despaired of ever being happy; and by thus persisting in a hopeless pas-sion, contradicted that maxim, that love, like fire, cannot subsist with-out continual motion, and ceases to be as soon as it ceases to hope or fear.
               Sophia, not able to remove her eyes from the place where she fan-cied she had seen Sir Charles, con-tinued to look fixedly towards the road, and was beginning to believe she had been mistaken, when a ser-vant in Sir Charles's livery rode by also, and put it out of doubt that she had really seen the master.
               
                  

feared to look up, lest they should betray her anguish, cast many an angry glance at her envious sister, and wished her a thousand miles off.
               Sophia having a little recovered herself, hastened towards her mo-ther, who, with a face of ignorant wonder, was following Mrs. Law-son about her little farm, asking a thousand questions, without heed-ing the answers she received. So-phia approaching, paid her duty to her with her usual tenderness and respect, which Mrs. Darnley return-ed with slightly kissing her cheek, telling her that she thought her complexion was greatly improved, and appealed to Harriot for the truth of her observation.
               Harriot answered,
That indeed she could not flatter her sister so much as to say she thought so; for if there was any alteration, it was rather for the worse.
               
               
                  
This unexpected incident a-wakened a thousand tender melan-choly ideas in her mind; and find-ing herself too much softened, she had recourse again to her work, to divert her imagination from an object, she had vainly endeavoured to forget.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXVI. Sir Charles appears again upon the Scene.
               SOPHIA was not deceived when she imagined she had seen Sir Charles; it was really he who had rode by her window, and it was her little abode he was in search of, though in his extream eagerness he had overlooked it.
               He had left England with a hope that change of scene, and a variety of new objects, would efface the idea of Sophia from his heart, and restore him to his former tranquility; but amidst all the delights of Paris he found himself opprest with langour: no amusements could entertain him, no conversation engage his attention; disgusted with every thing he saw

and heard, peevish, discontented, and weary of the world, he avoided all company, and had recourse to books for relief; but Sophia was too much in his thoughts to render study either instructive or amusing. He past whole days in solitude, feeding his melancholy with the reflection of a thousand past circumstances which served to soften his mind, and make him feel his loss more sensibly.
               When he reflected on her exalted virtues, her wit, her elegance, the attractive graces of her person, and the irresistable sweetness of her man-ners, he lamented his hard fate that had put such a treasure out of his reach; but when his conscience told him that it had once been in his power to have become possessor of this treasure, that he had trifled with that innocent affection till he had alienated it from himself to another

object; his anguish became insup-portable, and he sought to relieve it by rousing his indignation against her, for her preference of so unwor-thy a rival.
               He called to mind her interview with this happy rival in the field, and concluded he was far more fa-voured by her than himself had ever been, since her discourse to him had produced so tender and passionate an expression of acknowledgment as that the had beheld.
               These circumstances, which his imagination dwelt upon in order to lessen his regret, added to it all the stings of jealousy; so that, almost frantic with rage and grief, he was a hundred times upon the point of committing some desperate action.
               A violent fever was the conse-quence of these transports, which, after confining him a long time to his bed, left his body in a weak and

languishing condition, and his mind sunk in an habitual melancholy.
               His physicians recommended to him the air of Montpelier, and he was preparing to set out for that place when he happened to meet with a gentleman who made him al-ter his resolution.
               This person had been his gover-nor, and now attended Mr. Howard in the same quality.
               Sir Charles, who had a flight ac-quaintance with Mrs. Howard, was prevailed upon, nowithstanding his aversion to company, to receive a visit from her son: he invited the young gentleman to dine with him, and he having not yet forgot the lovely Sophia, drank her health after dinner by the name of miss Darnley.
               Sir Charles, who could not hear that name without a visible emotion, told him he knew two young ladies so called, and asked whether it was

the eldest or the youngest sister that he meant?
               Mr. Howard replied,
That he was ignorant till then that miss Darnley had a sister.
               
               
                  Yes she has a sister, said his governor, who is much hand-somer than herself, and for whom a youthful passion would be thought perhaps more excusa-ble.
               
               The young gentleman, who knew his governor talked in that contemp-tuous manner of Sophia in com-pliance with his mother's humour, in revenge avowed his admiration of her in the most passionate terms, and forgetting that Sir Charles had said he was acquainted with her, des-cribed her excellencies with all the enthusiasm of a lover.
               Sir Charles listened in silence; and when the other had done speaking told him, with an air of forced gai-ty,

that it was easy to see he was very much in love.
               This, indeed, was his real opi-nion; nevertheless, he felt no emo-tions of jealousy or resentment against a rival whom he believed as unhappy as himself; he asked him with a seeming carelessness if miss Sophia was not to be mar-ried to the son of a rich farmer in the village where she lived? and waited his answer with an agi-tation of mind which appeared so plainly in the frequent changes of his colour, that Mr. Howard must have observed it, had not the question given him almost as much concern.
               After a short pause he replied,
That he never heard she was go-ing to be married;
but, added he, sighing,
I remember I have seen a very handsome young man

at Mr. Lawson's, who per-haps â€”
               
               
                  Aye, aye, interrupted his go-vernor, smiling, he was the fa-voured lover no doubt, you have nothing to do but to forget her as soon as you can.
               
               The youth sat pensive and silent for some time, then suddenly rising, took leave of Sir Charles and went away; his governor prepared to fol-low him, but the baronet, anxious to hear more of Sophia, detained him to ask several questions concern-ing her acquaintance with Mr. Howard.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXVII. Gives the reader some necessary infor-mation.
               SIR Charles found his old friend had lost no part of his former candor and sincerity: though by the trust reposed in him he was obliged to discountenance as much as possible the passion of his pupil for a young woman so much his in-ferior in rank and fortune; yet hav-ing seen and conversed with Sophia, he did justice to her extraordinary merit, and acknowledged that Mrs. Howard had treated her harshly.
               He related to Sir Charles in what manner Mrs. Howard had invited her to her house, and the suspicions she entertained of Sophia's encou-raging her son's passion, and design to ensnare him into a clandestine

marriage. "Suspicions," added he,
which her subsequent behaviour entirely destroyed, for the youth was rash enough to avow his pas-sion openly, and sollicited her by frequent letters and messages to grant him an interview, which she absolutely refused, and this conduct did her honour and procured her great esteem; yet it is very likely that her affections are otherwise engaged, and that she has some difficulties to en-counter, for she looks thought-ful and melancholy, and affects retirement more than persons of her age generally do.
               
               Sir Charles was thrown into so profound a reverie by this account of Sophia, that he heard not a word of what his friend afterwards said which had no relation to this inte-resting subject, and scarce perceived when he went away.

Sophia, without attending to this difference of opinion, with regard to her complexion, was only solli-citous to know if her mother had been well; and while she was mak-ing some tender enquiries concern-ing her health, Mrs. Darnley, who never consulted either time or place, suddenly interrupted her, to draw her aside from the company, and asked her abruptly,
Whether she was not surprised at Sir Charles's indifference?
               
               Sophia, still smarting with the pangs her sister's discourse had given her, replied, in a tone of resent-ment,
That nothing now could surprise her with regard to Sir Charles.
               
               "Why, to say the truth, So-phia," replied Mrs. Darnley,
I believe he has quite forgot you; but there was a time when you 
                        â€¢
                     ight have been happy.â€”Oh,
After reflecting a long time with mingled grief, resentment, and compassion, upon her melan-choly, which he supposed was oc-casioned by some disappointment in the affair of her marriage with the young farmer, and which probably her want of fortune was the cause of, he suddenly formed the gene-rous design of removing this obstacle to her union with the person whom she preferred to him, and, by making her happy, entitle himself to her esteem, since he had unfortunately lost her heart.
               The novelty of this resolution and its extraordinary generosity, filled him with so many self-flatter-ing ideas, as suspended for a while his jealousy and his grief.
               Instead of going to Montpelier he set out immediately for England, and during his journey was continually applauding himself for the uncom-mon

disinterestedness of his con-duct.
               Nothing is more certain, than that the motives even of our best actions will not always bear exami-nation; we deceive ourselves first, and our vanity is too much interest-ed in the deception, to make us wish to detect it. Sir Charles ei-ther did not or would not perceive the latent hope that lurked within his bosom, and which, perhaps, suggested the designs he had formed.
               How must such an instance of generous passion, thought he, af-fect a mind so delicately sensible as Sophia's! she who had once loved him, and what was more than pro-bable had not yet entirely forgot him.
               He never asked himself, why his imagination dwelt upon these pleas-ing images? why he prosecuted

his journey with such eager haste, as if the purport of it was to receive, not to resign for ever the woman he so passionately loved?
               When he arrived at his own house scarce would he allow himself a few minutes rest after his fatiguing journey: he hastened to Mr. Her-bert's lodgings, to prevail upon him to justify by his concurrence the de-signs he had formed in favour of Sophia.
               Mean time the secret and power-ful impulse by which he was ac-tuated, kept his mind in a continu-al tumult. He hoped, he feared, he wished: he was all anxious expectation, all trembling doubt; he heard with grief that Mr. Her-bert was at Bath; for now he knew not how to get access to Sophia, who being ignorant of his intentions,

and offended by his behaviour, might possibly refuse to see him.
               He went to the house where Mrs. Darnley lived when he left England; he was surprised to see it shut up. This incident perplexed him more, and rendered him more impatient.
               He returned to his house, passed a restless night, and early in the morning ordering his horses to be saddled, set out immediately for Mr. Lawson's; where he arrived before he had resolved how to intro-duce himself, or who he should en-quire for.
               However, upon the appearance of a servant at the door, he asked for Mr. Herbert; which Mr. Law-son hearing, came out himself, and, though he did not know Sir Charles, politely requested him to alight, telling him, he had just received a letter

from Mr. Herbert, which ac-quainted him that he was per-fectly recovered, and that he was in the way to London.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXVIII. Sir Charles has an interview with Mr. Lawson.
               SIR Charles accepted Mr. Law-son's invitation, and alighting, followed him into a parlour, but in such perturbation of mind that he scarce knew what he did. The good curate, surprised at the pen-siveness and silence of his guest, knew not what to say to him, or how to entertain him: he gave him an account of Mr. Herbert's illness, which seemed to engage his atten-tion very little; but happening to mention Sophia in the course of his relation, the young baronet started as from a dream, and turned his eyes upon him with a look of eager-ness and anxiety, but said not a word.
               
                  
Mr. Lawson paused, as expecting he was going to ask him a question, which Sir Charles perceiving, said with some confusion,
I beg your pardon, Sir, you mentioned miss Sophia, I have the honour to know her, pray how does she do?
               
               "I hope she is well, Sir," repli-ed Mr. Lawson,
I have not seen her a long time.
               
               "Then she does not reside with you now," said Sir Charles, with a coun-tenance as pale as death, dreading to hear something still more fatal.
               As Mr. Lawson was going to an-swer him, William, not knowing his father-in-law had company, en-tered the room abruptly; but seeing the baronet, he bowed, apologized for his intrusion, and instantly re-tired.
               The various emotions with which

this sudden and unexpected sight of his rival filled the breast of Sir Charles, caused such a wildness in his looks, that Mr. Lawson, in great astonishment and perplexity asked him if he was taken ill?
               Sir Charles endeavouring to com-pose himself, replied,
That he was very well,
but in a faultering accent asked, who the young gen-tleman was that had just left the room.
               Mr. Lawson told him he was his son-in-law.
               "Your son-in-law!" cried Sir Charles, eagerly,
what! mar-ried to your daughter! is it pos-sible?
               
               Mr. Lawson knew enough of So-phia's story to make him compre-hend now who this young gentle-man was, who discovered so extra-ordinary a concern upon this occa-sion:

and, charmed to have an op-portunity of doing her service by removing those suspicions which he had been told had produced so fatal a reverse in her fortune, he gave the baronet a circumstantial account of his daughter's marriage: sensible that he was too much interested in this detail to make him think it impertinent, he introduced it no otherways than by declaring himself under the greatest obligation to miss Sophia, who having honoured his daughter with her friendship, had been the chief instrument of her present happiness.
               While the good curate related all the circumstances of an affair which had had such melancholy conse-quences, the baronet listened to him with an attention still as the grave; his eyes were fixed upon his with a look of the most eager anxiety,

and he scarce suffered himself to breathe for fear of losing any of his words.
               In proportion as his doubts were removed, his countenance e
                     â€¢
                  pressed more satisfaction, and when, upon his reflecting on all that he had heard, it appeared plainly that the fatal meeting which had caused him so much anguish, was the effect of Sophia's solicitude to serve her friend, and that the passionate ac-tion of the youth was an acknow-ledgment of gratitude, not an ex-pression of love, he was not able to conceal the excess of his joy, but, rising up in a sudden transport, he took the curate's hand, and pres-sing it eagerly, "You know not," said he,
Mr. Lawson, how happy you have made me! but where is miss Sophia, is she gone to Bath with her good friend Mr. Herbert?
               
               
                  

girl, girl,
pursued she, kindling with anger as she spoke,
you were always obstinate and con-ceited; what a foolish part have you played with all your wit! but I am to blame to trouble myself about you.
               
               Sophia now eased her loaded heart by a shower of tears.
It is to little purpose now,
said Mrs. Darnley,
to repent of your imprudent behaviour; you were too wise to take a parent's advice, when it might have been useful: when a man of rank and fortune makes his addresses to a woman who is inferior to him in both, he expects a thousand little com-placencies and attentions from her, which, without wounding her honour, may convince him that it is not to his riches she sa-crifices herself.
               
               "Ah, madam," cried Sophia,
"No, Sir," replied Mr. Law-son;
she lives with her mother. You know, I suppose, that Mrs. Darnley has lost her annuity by the death of the gentleman upon whom it was charged.
               
               "I never heard it till now," said the baronet, whose tenderness was alarmed for his Sophia;
tell me I beg you what is her present situation.
               
               
                  Her eldest daughter has left her,
said Mr. Lawson,
and she has retired with miss Sophia to a village about five miles from hence, in the road to London, where that excellent young lady supports her mother and her-self by the labour of her hands.
               
               "Angelick creature!" exclaimed Sir Charles, with his eyes swimming in tears. Then, after a little pause,

he desired a direction to the place where Mrs. Darnley lived, and took a kind leave of Mr. Lawson, telling him he hoped soon to visit him again.
               Sir Charles, although he galloped as fast as it was possible, found his horse went too slow for his impati-ence; so eager was he to see Sophia, and gain her pardon for the unrea-sonable conduct which his jea-lousy and rage had made him guilty of.
               The account Mr. Lawson had given him of the part she had taken in his daughter's marriage with the youth whom he had considered as his rival, not only removed the torturing pangs of jealousy, which he had so long felt, but made him view several circumstances in So-phia's behaviour in a light favour-able to his own ardent wishes.
               
                  
He fondly fancied that the me-lancholy in which he had heard she was plunged, was occasioned by a tender remembrance of him; and that the hope of still being his, might have been the chief cause of her rejecting the addresses of Mr. Howard.
               How different were these ideas from the gloomy ones which had hitherto perplexed his mind! he seemed like a man waked from a frightful dream of despair and death, to a certainty of life and joy.
               Amidst these transporting reve-ries he had passed by Sophia's house, without perceiving it to be the same he had been directed to; and when he had reached the end of the village, he looked about for it in vain, and saw no one of whom he could enquire

for it but an old woman, who was sitting under a tree near the road, making up a nosegay of some flowers, such as the late season pro-duced.
               He stopped his horse, and asked her if she knew where Mrs. Darnley lived? At the mention of that name she rose as hastily as her feebleness would permit her, and told him, she knew the house very well; and, if he pleased, would go and shew it him.
I am making up this nosegay for the sweet young gentlewo-man her daughter,
said the old woman:
I carry her flowers every day; heaven bless her, she is my only support. There is a great many fine folks here-abouts, from whom I could ne-ver get any relief; but since she came hither I have wanted

for nothing. Pray let me shew you her house; old and weak as I am, I would walk ten miles to do her service.
               
               Sir Charles, alighting from his horse, ordered his servant to lead it to the nearest public house, and wait for him there; he told the old woman, he would accept of her offer, and walk along with her. Then taking two guineas out of his pocket, he gave them to her, in reward, he said, for the gratitude she expressed for her young benefac-tress.
               The good woman received his bounty with a transport of surprise and joy, and pleasingly repaid him by talking of his beloved Sophia; of whom she related many in-stances of tenderness and charity to-wards the poor of the village, and filled him with admiration of that

true benevolence, which even in the midst of indigence, could ad-minister to the greater wants of her fellow creatures.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXXIX. Sophia receives an unexpected Visit.
               WHEN they came within sight of Sophia's little cot-tage, the old woman, pointing to it, told him, Mrs. Darnley and her daughter lived there: upon which the baronet, dismissing her, walked up to it with disordered haste. A row of wooden pales led to a small grass-plat before the door.
               As he approached, he saw Sophia sitting at a window at work. He stopped to gaze upon her; she ap-peared to him more lovely, more engaging than ever. He wished, yet dreaded her looking up, lest her first thoughts upon seeing him be-ing unfavourable, she should resolve to refuse his visit. He went for-wards

with a beating heart, and cautiously opening the little gate, reached the door of this humble habitation unheard and unseen by Sophia: the door flew open at his touch; poverty has no need of bolts and bars, and every good an-gel is the guard of innocence and virtue.
               The noise he made in entering, and the sound of her name, pro-nounced in a tender accent, made Sophia hastily raise her head. At sight of Sir Charles, she started from her chair, her work fell from her trembling hands, she looked at him in silent astonishment, una-ble, and perhaps unwilling to avoid him.
               The baronet, whose heart la-boured with the strongest emotions of tenderness, anxiety, hope, and fear, had not power to utter a word; and while her surprise kept

her motionless, threw himself at her feet, and taking one of her hands, pressed it respectfully to his lips, tears at the same time falling from his eyes.
               Sophia, whose gentle mind was sensibly affected with this action, and the paleness and langour which appeared in his countenance, found it impossible to treat him with that severity which his capricious con-duct seemed to demand of her; nevertheless, she drew away her hand, which he yielded with re-luctant submission.
               "I hoped," said she, in an ac-cent that expressed more softness and grief than anger or disdain,
that I should be spared any farther insults of this sort from you; those I have already suf-fered have sufficiently punished me for my weak credulity.
               
               Sir Charles, when she began to

speak, rose up; but continued gazing on her with the most passi-onate tenderness, while every word she uttered seemed to pierce his heart.
               "I will not," pursued Sophia, gathering firmness as she spoke,
ask you, why you have intruded upon me thus unexpectedly? or why you assume a behaviour so little of a-piece with your past actions? I only beg you to believe, that I am not again to be deceived; and although I am persuaded my good opinion is of no con-sequence to you, yet I will tell you, that if it is possible to regain it, it will be by never more importuning me with vi-sits, which my situation in life makes it very improper for me to admit of.
               
               
                  

                  that is a snare which, has been fatal to many young women in my circumstances. Who sees not the advantages this gives a man whose aim is to seduce? I am persuaded these pernicious max-ims are not yours, but his, for whose ungenerous purpose they are so well calculated.
               
               Sophia guessed truly; the young baronet had often had discourses of this sort with Mrs. Darnley, who nevertheless took it ill that her daughter should offer her such an affront as to suppose she did not understand maxims as well as Sir Charles.
               Nothing is more certain than that we are never made so ridicu-lous by the qualities we have, as by those we affect to have. Mrs. Darn-ley, with all her ignorance, aspired to be thought witty: she therefore vindicated her claim to what So-phia
Sophia, when she had said this, went out of the room, without casting a look back upon Sir Charles, who followed her in great disorder, conjuring her only to hear what he had to say.
               As she was passing to her own chamber, she was met by her mo-ther, who seeing Sir Charles, was filled with surprise and joy; and perceiving that Sophia was avoid-ing him, cried to her with an an-gry accent,
Where are you go-ing? what is the meaning of this rudeness?
               
               Sophia, without answering her, retired to her own room, not without great perturbation of mind; for there was something in the baronet's looks and words that seemed to merit a hearing at least; but she dreaded the weakness of her own heart, and was fully per-suaded that any condescension on

her side would give him too great an advantage over her.
               Mrs. Darnley, finding any endea-vours to retain her were fruitless, advanced towards Sir Charles with great obsequiousness, congratulated him upon his return, and thanked him for the honour he did her in visiting her in her poor little ha-bitation.
               Sir Charles saluted her respect-fully, and took a seat.
There is a sad alteration, Sir,
said she,
in my poor affairs since I saw you last. I never thought to have received you in such a ho-vel! You have heard, I suppose, of my misfortune?
               
               Sir Charles, who was in great confusion of thought, and had scarce heard a word she said, replied care-lessly,
Yes, madam, I am sorry for it.
               
               The coldness of this answer cast

a damp upon those hopes which she had eagerly admitted upon seeing him again; and, impatient to be relieved from her torment-ing anxiety on account of this un-expected visit, she asked him abruptly,
whether she might wish him joy, for she heard,
she said,
that he was going to be married.
               
               Sir Charles, rouzed by this ques-tion, replied hastily,
Who could have told you any thing so un-likely? Married! no, madam, there never was any foundation for such a report.
               
               "Indeed I believe so," said Mrs. Darnley, almost breathless with joy to find him deny it so ear-nestly.
To be sure people are very envious and ill-natured, and those who told me, no doubt, designed to do you an ill office.
               
               
                  
"And they have succeeded," said Sir Charles, sighing,
if they have been able to persuade miss Sophia, that after having aspir-ed to the possession of her, I could descend to love any other woman. I came to implore her pardon, madam,
pursued he,
for all the extravagancies of my past conduct, and for that unreasonable jealousy which was the source of them, could I have been so happy to have prevailed upon her to have heard me.
               
               "What!" interrupted Mrs. Darnley eagerly,
and was my daughter so rude as to leave you without hearing what you had to say. I protest I am asham-ed of her behaviour; but I hope you will be so good to excuse it, Sir; I will insist upon her com-ing in again.
               
               
                  
"No, madam," said Sir Charles, holding her, for she was hurrying a-way,
miss Sophia must not be con-strained: I cannot bear that.
               
               Mrs. Darnley unwillingly resum-ed her seat, and inly fretting at her daughter's obstinacy, trembled for the event of this visit.
               Sir Charles, after a silence of some minutes, suddenly rose up, and took his leave. Mrs. Darn-ley, in great anxiety, followed him to the door, and said she hoped to see him again. He answered only by a low bow, and walked away full of doubt and perplexity.
               Sophia's steadiness in refusing to hear him, banished all those flat-tering ideas of her tenderness for him, which he had so eagerly ad-mitted; for he concluded that if her heart had not been steeled by indifference, she would, not-withstanding

her just reasons for resentment, have been rejoiced to give him an opportunity of justify-ing himself.
               He had reached the house where his servant was attending with the horses, without having determin-ed what to do. To return to town without seeing Sophia again, and being assured of a reconcilia-tion, was misery which he could not support; and he dreaded mak-ing a new attempt to see her, lest he should receive more proofs of her insensibility and disdain.
               In this perplexity the sight of Mr. Herbert alighting from a stage-coach, was a relief as great as it was unexpected; and in the sud-den joy he felt at meeting with a man whose interposition could be so useful to him, he forgot that his former behaviour must

necessarily have given rise to strong prejudices against him, and ran up to embrace the good old man with extreme cordia-lity.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XL. In which the History begins to grow dull.
               MR. Herbert was surprised at this meeting, and repaid the civilities of the young baronet with some coldness: upon which Sir Charles, in some confusion, de-sired to have a few moments con-versation with him.
               They walked together down a meadow; and Sir Charles, hav-ing with a candor and sincerity becoming the rectitude of his in-tentions, related all those cir-cumstances which had concurred to excite his jealousy, and with that powerful eloquence which passion inspires, expatiated upon

the motives of his conduct, a conduct which he acknowledged laid him open to the most un-favourable suspicions; Mr. Her-bert, convinced of his sincerity, and full of compassion for the uneasiness which his mistaken jealousy had caused him, under-took to make his peace with Sophia, and assured him he would very shortly wait upon him in town.
               This would not satisfy the anxious lover; he declared he would not leave the place till he was assured of his pardon; and Mr. Herbert, who certainly was not displeased with his ob-stinacy, could with difficulty per-suade him to wait only till the next day for an account of his success.
               Sir Charles unwillingly took

the road to London, and Mr. Herbert hastened to congratu-late his beloved charge upon the agreeable prospect that was once more opening for her.
               Mrs. Darnley had, during this interval, been employed in re-proaching poor Sophia for her behaviour to Sir Charles. In the vexation of her heart, she exclaimed in the severest terms against her pride and obstina-cy; she told her, she might be assured Sir Charles would never attempt to see her again; that it was plain he was disgusted with her bad temper.
               She burst into a passion of tears, while she enumerated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune, which, she said, Sophia had thrown from her; and among many motives which

had called maxims; no matter whether they were pernicious or not. The word maxim sounded learnedly in her ears: she told her daughter, with great asperity, that she was so conceited and vain of her own wit, that she would allow no one else to have any. Sophia found it difficult enough to appease her, but she suc-ceeded at length, and they joined the rest of the company.
            
            
               

she urged, ought to have deter-mined her to act otherwise, that of being able to out-shine her sister was one.
               Sophia answered only by sighs: she herself was not absolutely sa-tisfied with the unrelenting se-verity with which she had treat-ed Sir Charles. The more she reflected upon his behaviour, the more she condemned herself for not hearing what he had to offer in his own de-fence.
               She had once thought it proba-ble that he had been deceived by the report that was spread through Mrs. Gibbons's folly, of her encouraging the addresses of her nephew, and his extravagant conduct might be occasioned by jealousy: a fault which a woman is always disposed to pardon in a

In the vexation of her heart, she exclaimed in the severest terms against her pride and obstina-cy; she told her, she might be assured Sir Charles would never attempt to see her again; that it was plain he was disgusted with her bad temper.
               She burst into a passion of tears, while she enumerated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune, which, she said, Sophia had thrown from her; and among many motives which

she urged, ought to have deter-mined her to act otherwise, that of being able to out-shine her sister was one.
               Sophia answered only by sighs: she herself was not absolutely sa-tisfied with the unrelenting se-verity with which she had treat-ed Sir Charles. The more she reflected upon his behaviour, the more she condemned herself for not hearing what he had to offer in his own de-fence.
               She had once thought it proba-ble that he had been deceived by the report that was spread through Mrs. Gibbons's folly, of her encouraging the addresses of her nephew, and his extravagant conduct might be occasioned by jealousy: a fault which a woman is always disposed to pardon in a

lover. While she revolved these thoughts in her mind, Mrs. Darnley perceived her uneasiness, and added to it by new re-proaches.
               Mr. Herbert's arrival put an end to this tormenting scene. Sophia first heard his voice, and flew to receive him; Mrs. Darn-ley followed, and seeing her bath-ed in tears, while the good old man saluted her with the ten-derness of a parent, she told him, with an air half serious, half gay, that her daughter loved him so well, she had no affec-tion for any one else. She then entered abruptly upon the affair of Sir Charles, though she hard-ly expected Mr. Herbert would join with her in condemning Sophia.
               He pleasingly surprised her by

saying, that Sophia was to blame; and that he came prepared to chide her for her petulance and obstinacy.
               Mr. Herbert, who saw a sweet impatience in Sophia's looks, explained himself immediately, and told her he had met Sir Charles; who had fully remov-ed all the suspicions his strange conduct had occasioned, and convinced him, that he deserved more pity than censure.
               "No doubt." pursued he, look-ing on Sophia with a smile,
you will be surprised to hear, young lady, that Sir Charles was witness to the interview you had in the mea-dow behind Mr. Lawson's house, with a certain hand-some youth, whom he had

heard was his rival, and a favoured rival too. What were his thoughts, do you imagine, when he saw this handsome youth throw himself at your feet, and kiss your hand?
               
               Mrs. Darnley now looked at her daughter in great astonish-ment; and Sophia, who yet did not recollect the circumstance of her meeting William, was so per-plexed, she knew not what to say.
               Mr. Herbert enjoyed her in-nocent confusion for a few mo-ments, and then repeated all that Sir Charles had told him, of his jealousy and rage; his vain attempts to banish her from his remembrance; the resolution he had formed after his con-versation

with Mr. Howard con-cerning her; and how happily he had been undeceived at Mr. Lawson's, where he found his supposed rival was the husband of her friend.
               "Well," interrupted Mrs. Darnley, with great vehemence,
I hope you are satisfied now, Sophia! I hope you will treat Sir Charles with more civi-lity if he comes again.â€”Mr. Herbert, I beg you will exert your power over her upon this occasionâ€”I think there is no doubt of Sir Charles's honourable intentions.
               
               Thus she ran on, while So-phia, who had listened to Mr. Herbert's relation with the soft-est emotions of pity, tender-ness, and joy, continued silent

with her eyes fixed upon the ground.
               Mr. Herbert, willing to spare her delicacy, told Mrs. Darn-ley, that relying upon Sophia's good sense and prudence, he had ventured to assure Sir Charles of a more favourable recepti-on, when her prejudices were re-moved.
               
                  He will come to-morrow, my child,
pursued he,
to implore your pardon for all the errors of his past conduct, and to offer you his hand. I am persuaded you will act properly upon this occasion; and in a marriage so far be-yond your hopes and expec-tations, acknowledge the hand of Providence, which thinks fit to reward you, even in

this world, for your steady ad-herence to virtue.
               
               Sophia bowed and blushed; her mother, in a rapture, embraced and wished her joy.
               Mr. Herbert now endeavoured to change the conversation to sub-jects more indifferent; but Mrs. Darnley, ever thoughtless and unseasonable, could talk of no-thing but Sir Charles, and the grandeur which awaited her daughter.
               All night her fancy ran upon gilt equipages, rich jewels, mag-nificent houses, and a train of servants; and she was by much too happy to taste any re-pose.
               Sophia enjoyed the change of her fortune with much more rational delight; and among

all the sentiments that arose in her mind upon this occasion, that of gratitude to heaven was the most frequent and the most lively.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XIX. Sophia is agreeably surprized.
               MRS. Lawson easily prevailed upon her guests to stay that night and the following day, which, being Sunday, Harriot could not re-sist the temptation of displaying her charms and her fine cloaths in a country church, which was so new a triumph, that the thoughts of it kept her waking almost the whole night.
               The ridiculous airs she assumed to draw the admiration of the simple villagers, who never saw any thing so fine and so gay before, and who stared at her with stupid surprize, made Sophia often blush for her: but her affected glances were chiefly directed to the beautiful youth, whose insensibility had so greatly

               
                  CHAP. XLI. The History concluded.
               MR. Herbert, who had accept-ed a lodging in Sophia's cottage, went to Sir Charles the next day, according to his pro-mise. He found him waiting for him full of anxious impatience; and hearing from the good old man, that Sophia was disposed to receive him favourably, he embrac-ed him in a transport of joy; and his chariot being already ordered, they drove immediately to the village.
               Mrs. Darnley welcomed the baronet with a profusion of civi-lities. Sophia's behaviour was full of dignity, mingled with

that softness peculiar to her cha-racter.
               Sir Charles, after a long con-versation with her, obtained her leave to demand her of her mo-ther, to whom he shewed the writings, which were already all drawn; and by which Sophia had a jointure and pin-money, equal to the settlements that had been made upon Lady Stan-ley.
               He now ventured to intreat that a short day might be fixed for their marriage. It was with great difficulty, that Sophia was pre-vailed upon to consent; but her mother's impetuosity carried all before it, and Mr. Herbert him-self supported the young baronet's request.
               The ceremony was performed by Mr. Lawson in his own parish-church:

after which he and his amiable family accompanied the new wedded pair to their country-seat, where they passed several days with them.
               Mr. Herbert having previously acquainted Sir Charles with Har-riot's situation, the baronet, tho' he detested her character, and de-clared he never could pardon her for the miseries she had caused him; yet was desirous to have her decently settled, and pro-mised to give a thousand pounds with her in marriage, if a reput-able match could be found for her: he even put notes for that sum into Mr. Herbert's hands, and earnestly recommended it to him, to take the affair under his ma-nagement.
               Harriot, during the time she lived with her mother, had been

courted by a young tradesman in tolerable circumstances; and although she thought it great in-solence for a person in business to pretend to her, yet, actuated by a true spirit of coquetry, while she despised the lover, she took pleasure in his addresses.
               This young man still retained some tenderness for her, and al-lured by the prospect of a for-tune, was willing, notwithstand-ing any faults in her conduct, to make her his wife.
               Mrs. Darnley proposed him to her, and Mr. Herbert enforced her advice with all the good sense he was master of. But Harriot received the proposal with the utmost disdain; insisted that she was married as well as her sister; that her rank in life was superior to hers; and added, by way of

threat, that her appearance should be so likewise.
               The extraordinary efforts she made to support this boast en-gaged lord L. in expences that en-tirely alienated his affections from her, disgusted as he long had been with her insolence and folly.
               His relations concluded a match for him with a young lady of suitable rank and fortune; and, after making a small settlement on Harriot, he took leave of her for ever.
               The vexation she felt from this incident, threw her into a dis-temper very fatal to beauty. The yellow jaundice made such ravage in her face, that scarce any of those charms on which she had valued herself so much, remained. All her anxious hours

were now employed in repairing her complexion, and in vain en-deavours to restore lustre to those eyes, sunk in hollowness, and tinctured with the hue of her distemper.
               Although thus altered, the re-port of the fortune she was likely to have made her be thought a prize worthy the ambition of a young officer, who had quitted the business of a peruke maker, in which he was bred, for an ensign's commission, which made him a gentleman at once.
               He offered himself to Harriot with that assurance of success, which the gaiety of his ap-pearance, and his title of cap-tain, gave him reason to expect, with a lady of her turn of mind.
               Harriot, charmed with so im-portant

a conquest, soon con-sented to give him her hand; and Sir Charles Stanley, finding his character not exceptionable, gave her the fortune he had promised, to which Sophia ge-nerously added a thousand pounds more. The baronet procured her husband a better commission; but designedly in one of the colonies, whither he insisted upon his wife's accompanying him.
               Harriot, in despair at being obliged to quit the delights of London, soon began to hate her husband heartily, and he, enter-ing into her disposition and cha-racter, lost all esteem and ten-derness for her. Her behaviour justified the rigid confinement he kept her in; and while she suffered all the restraint of jea-lousy,

she was at the same time mortified with the knowledge that pride and not love was the source of it.
               Mrs. Darnley lived not long after the departure of her favourite daughter; for so Harriot always continued to be.
               Sophia attended her mother du-ring her long illness with the most duteous care, and had the satisfaction to be assured by Mr. Lawson, who assisted her in her preparations for death, that her attachment to the world, which the affluent circumstances to which she was raised but too much increased, had at length given way to more pious senti-ments; and she died with the resignation of a christian.
               The ill conduct of her sister, and the death of her mother,

proved at first some interruption to Sophia's happiness; but these domestic storms blown over, she began to taste the good fortune which heaven had bestowed on her: her chief enjoyment of it was to share it with others; and Sir Charles, who adored her, put it amply in her power to indulge the benevolence of her disposition.
               He took upon himself the care of rewarding her friends; he presented Mr. Lawson to a very considerable living: he pro-cured Dolly's husband a genteel and lucrative employment; and married her sister to a relation of his own.
               Mr. Herbert, who was above receiving any other gratification from Sir Charles than the entire friendship which he ever pre-served

for him, had the satis-faction to spend most part of his time with his beloved daugh-ter, as he used tenderly to call Sophia, and to behold her as happy as the condition of mor-tality admits of.
               Sir Charles's tenderness for her seemed to increase every day; and when Mr. Herbert some years after this marriage took occasion to compliment him up-on the delicacy, the ardor, and the constancy of his affection, he replied,
You attribute to me a virtue, which, in this case, I cannot be said to possess; had my passion for my So-phia been founded only on the charms of her person, I might probably ere now have become a mere fashionable husband; but her virtue and

mortified her pride: she saw his eyes constantly turned towards the pew where she sat; but she saw plainly that it was not her charms that drew them thither. She had no suspicion that Dolly was the ob-ject of his affection, and sensible, to her great grief, of her sister's power to charm, she no longer doubted that this envied conquest was hers.
               Thus disappointed, she appeared so much out of humour, and so im-patient to return to town, that Mrs. Darnley, over whom her power was absolute, complied with her importunity, and set out with her for London, as soon as they returned from church; notwithstanding all the endeavours of the good cu-rate and his wife to detain them to dinner.
               Sophia was now left alone to her own melancholy reflections; this

wit supply her with graces ever varied, and ever new. Thus the steadiness of my af-fection for her,
pursued he, smiling,
is but a constant in-constancy, which attaches me successively to one or other of those shining qualities, of which her charming mind is an inex-haustible source.
               
            
            FINIS.
         
      
   


visit from her mother and sister had produced a sad reverse in her si-tuation: hitherto hope had not quite forsaken her: the idea of being still beloved by Sir Charles lessen-ed all her griefs, and supported her amidst the doubt and anxiety which his mysterious conduct had involved her in: his indifference, so appa-rent in her sister's account of him, gave her pangs unfelt before: and never till now did she think herself unhappy; for, unperceived by her-self, she had encouraged a secret hope that the passion she had in-spired him with, would not be ea-sily subdued; and that perhaps all which she had thought exceptiona-ble in his conduct, proceeded not from a settled design to the preju-dice of her honour, but from that irresolution and slowness with which a man, too sensible of his superio-rity in birth and fortune, proceeds

in an affair of marriage, where he has no obstacles to fear, and where every thing depends upon himself.
               She now perceived the necessity of banishing Sir Charles from her heart; but at the same time, she perceived all the difficulty of the task. Though ashamed of her tears, she wept, and passionately exclaim-ed against her own weakness, which had kept her in a delusion so fatal to her peace. She continued the whole day in her chamber, wholly absorbed in melancholy thoughts.
               Dolly, who knew enough of her situation to guess the cause of this new affliction, was grieved to find herself excluded as well as the rest of the family; and although she ardently wished to console her, yet she durst not intrude uncalled upon her retirement. While she waited impatiently for her appearance, a visitor arrived, who she knew

would be welcome to her charming friend. As soon as she perceived him, she flew with eager haste to inform Sophia, and, tapping at her door, told her in a joyful voice, that Mr. Herbert was just alighted.
               Sophia, surprised at the news, instantly opened her chamber-door, and smiling tenderly upon the charming girl, to whom she excus-ed herself for her long absence, hastened to receive the good old man, who, after some affectionate enquiries concerning her health, rallied her upon the melancholy that appeared in her countenance.
               Sophia blushed and fixed her eyes on the ground, not a little surprised at his talking to her in that manner; and when with a bashful air, she looked up again, and saw a more than usual chearfulness in his eyes, her confusion encreased, and for a few moments she

could not help feeling some re-sentment against her benefactor, for thus diverting himself with her uneasiness.
               Mr. Herbert whose thoughts were wholly employed on the pleasing news he brought, did not perceive how much his beha-viour embarrassed her: to prevent his renewing a subject so disa-greeable, she talked of the visit her mother and sister made her.
               Mr. Herbert asked her,
If they had mentioned Sir Charles, and what she thought of him now?
               
               
                  I think of him as I ought to do,
replied Sophia, with some warmth, "I despise him."
               "Be not too rash, my dear child," said Mr. Herbert;
if your sister, whose malice I well know, has suggested any

thing to Sir Charles's disadvan-tage, be assured she deceives you; for I am convinced he not only loves you, but loves you with honour.
               
               Sophia, who from the first words Mr. Herbert uttered, had been in great agitation, as expecting something extraordinary, was so overwhelmed with surprize at what she heard, that her speech and colour forsaking her, she remain-ed pale, silent, and motionless in her chair.
               Mr. Herbert, perceiving how powerfully this news operated on her spirits, began to be appre-hensive of the consequences, and was rising hastily to give her some assistance, when Sophia, roused to recollection by this mo-tion of her venerable friend, and ashamed of the extreme sensi-bility she had discovered, apolo-gised

for it with a charming modesty, that greatly affected the good old man, who, if he had known in what melancholy thoughts she had passed the day, would have told her with more cau-tion, a circumstance that raised her at once from despair to hope, and produced so great a change in her situation.
               As we are never so ready to fear a disappointment as when we are nearest the completion of our wishes, Sophia, with a sweet apprehensiveness, which yet she laboured to conceal, hinted her doubts of the baronet's sin-cerity; Mr. Herbert answering explicitly to these half expressed doubts, told her, that he was fully persuaded Sir Charles would act like a man of honour.
I will give you an exact account,
said he to her,
of what has passed be-tween

us, from which you may judge yourself of his conduct:
he then took a letter out of his pocket, and desired her to read it.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XX. Mr. Herbert acquaints Sophia with the Result of the Interview be-tween Sir Charles and him.
               SOPHIA, trembling a little at the sight of Sir Charles's hand-writing, took the billet, and found it contained a message from him to Mr. Herbert, requesting in very earnest terms, the favour of an in-terview, and an offer to wait upon him at any hour he should ap-point.
               "You may be sure," said Mr. Herbert, receiving back the billet which Sophia gave him without speaking a word,
that I did not suffer Sir Charles to come to me; hearing from the messenger that his master was at home waiting for my answer, I attended him

immediately. I perceived a little embarrassment in his countenance upon my first entrance, but that soon wore off: he welcomed me with great politeness, and after thanking me for the ho-nour I did him, in preventing his visit, he entered immediate-ly upon the affair which had occasioned his sending to me.
               
               
                  You have, Sir, said he, shewn so truly a paternal affection for the young lady to whom I have paid my addresses, and are so much esteemed and reverenced by her, that I think I may without any impropriety, ad-dress myself to you upon this occasionâ€”
               
               "Here he paused, and seemed a "little perplexed.
               
                  To be sure, added he, I ought to have done this before; my conduct must have appeared ca-pricious

both to her and you, and indeed it was capricious,â€” butâ€”
               
               
                  Here he paused again, and fixed his eyes on the ground. His frankness,
pursued Mr. Herbert,
pleased me greatly, and disposed me to give him a fa-vourable attention.
               
               
                  I cannot blame Miss Sophia, resumed he, for acting as she has done; my heart did homage to her virtue at the time that I suf-fered most from the contemptu-ous behaviour it suggested to her. Fain would I hope, added he sighing, that the prejudices she has conceived against me have not entirely banished me from her remembrance; the de-licacy of my passion would be but ill satisfied by calling so de-serving a woman my own, unless I could likewise boast a prefer-ence

in her heart that left me no room to doubt my fortune had any share in determining her in my favour.
               
               "I know not," pursued Mr. Her-bert,
whether Sir Charles expect-ed any answer to this declara-tion; it is certain he looked on me with a kind of anxious timi-dity, and stopped a moment; I continued silent, and he pro-ceeded in this manner.
               
               
                  I know Miss Sophia has an understanding too solid, and a mind too noble to suffer any con-siderations of rank and fortune to determine her solely in an affair upon which the happiness of her life depends: she would not sure-ly give her hand where her heart did not acknowledge a prefer-ence. 'Tis thus I answer all those doubts which my situation, and perhaps an overstrained de-licacy

suggest: I am impatient to convince her of the purity of my passion; and considering you as her friend, her guardian, and one who is in the place of a fa-ther to her, I will take no steps in this affair but such as have the sanction of your approbation; I will not even presume to visit her without your permission: be you my advocate with her, tell her I lay myself and fortune at her feet, and will receive her from your hand as the greatest blessing that heaven can bestow on me.
               
               "Now, my child,," pursued Mr. Herbert, looking on Sophia with a smile,
how would you have had me answer to this discourse? was it necessary, think you, to play off a few female artifices here, and keep Sir Charles in doubt and anxious suspence, or did the

apparent openness and candor of his procedure deserve an equal degree of frankness on my part?
               
               "It is not to be doubted," said Sophia blushing,
but that on this occasion, as on every other, you acted with the utmost prudence.
               
               "I find," resumed Mr. Herbert, that you are resolved beforehand, to approve of whatever I said: well then, I told Sir Charles, that his present declaration en-tirely satisfied me; that being fully convinced of his sincerity, I looked upon his offer as high-ly honourable and advantageous to you; and that I was very sure you would have all the sense you ought to have of so generous an affection.
               
               
                  He then begged me to set out immediately for this place, and prepare you to receive a visit from him. This request I could

not possibly comply with, having business in town, which would necessarily detain me for some hours; but I promised him to go as soon as that was dispatched, which probably might be in the afternoon.
               
               
                  He modestly asked my leave to accompany me; but this I de-clined, as fearing his sudden ap-pearance, without your being previously acquainted with what had past, might occasion some perplexity and uneasiness to you; so it was agreed that he should come to-morrow.
               
               "To-morrow," replied Sophia, with an emotion she was not able to suppress.
               "Yes, my child," replied the good old man,
have you any ob-jections to this?
               
               "I know not," replied Sophia, with downcast eyes and a faultering

accent,
what I ought to do; I have been so used to consider Sir Charles's professions in an unfa-vourable point of view; my heart has been so accustomed to sus-pect himâ€”to guard itself against delusive hopesâ€”perhaps I ought not to admit his visit so easily; â€”perhaps I ought to resent his former behaviour. I own I am greatly perplexed, but I will be determined wholly by your ad-vice.
               
               Mr. Herbert saw her delicate scruples, and, to favour her modes-ty, answered, with the authority of a guardian,
When Sir Charles visits you next, Miss Sophia, he comes to offer you his hand; he has asked my consent as your guardian and your friend; and I, presuming on my influence over you in both these characters, have given it freely; and how

indeed, having your interest and happiness sincerely at heart, could I do otherwise? but if you think his former behaviour, in which however there were only suspi-cions against him, deserves to be resented, at a time when those suspicions are absolutely destroy-ed, you must go through with your heroism, and see him no more; for as the poet says,
"He comes too near who comes to be denied.
so he has offended too much who needs a pardon.
               
               Sophia, who felt all the force of this, reasoning, answered only by a blushing silence. Mr. Herbert then told her, that Sir Charles had de-clared to him that he would make the same settlements on her as had been stipulated for his mother; for he added, with equal delicacy and

tenderness,
Miss Sophia, in vir-tue, wit, good-sense, and every female excellence, brings me an immense portion.
               
               "Sir Charles," pursued Mr. Her-bert smiling,
by a strange contra-diction, which is, I suppose, al-ways found in lovers, though he was impatient to have me with you, yet could not help detain-ing me to have the pleasure of talking of you: he painted to me very naturally, the uneasiness he had suffered from your supposed contempt of him: he told me, that he was at one time deter-mined to travel, in order to efface you from his remembrance; but, (said he, rising and unlock-ing a cabinet, from which he took out a paper and put into my hands,) you shall judge whether amidst all my resentment I did not still love Miss Sophia; that

is my will, which I ordered to be drawn up previous to my in-tended journey.
               
               
                  He then, to spare me the trouble of reading it all through, pointed to the place where you was mentioned, and I found he had bequeathed you an estate of four hundred pounds a-year for life, and five thousand pounds to be disposed of as you pleas-ed.
               
               This last circumstance touched Sophia so much that tears filled her eyes; she sighed, and turned her head aside to conceal her emo-tion, while Mr. Herbert, without seeming to observe it, continued to repeat to her several expressions used by Sir Charles, which shewed the greatness of his affection, and his veneration for her virtues.
               "We parted at length," pur-sued Mr. Herbert,
extremely

well satisfied with each other, and to-morrow, or next day, at farthest, you may expect to see Sir Charles here; for he told me, that if he received no ill news from me, he would conclude I had prepared him a favourable reception; and, presuming on this hope, he would immediate-ly set his lawyer to work to prepare the writings, that no-thing might be left undone which could convince you of the sincerity of his affections; therefore, my dear child, set your heart at rest; and since providence has thought fit to reward your piety and virtue, receive with humble gratitude that fortune to which you are raised, and which puts it so largely in your power to do good. I will now leave you,
said the good old man rising,
to your own

reflections; I have scarce spoke a word yet to our kind friends here, for I was so impatient to see you, that I left them very abruptly.
               
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXI. Sophia is threatened with a new Dis-appointment.
               MR. Herbert had no sooner left the room, than Sophia, in an ardent ejaculation, thanked heaven for thus relieving her from her distress: but it was long ere the tumult in her mind raised by such unhoped for happy news subsided, and gave place to that calm recol-lection which supplied a thousand pleasing ideas, and filled her with the softest emotions of gratitude, tenderness, and joy.
               She was now freed from those tormenting doubts, which made her consider her tenderness for Sir Charles as a crime, and occasioned so many, painful struggles in her mind. What joy to reflect that

the man she loved was worthy of her affection! how pleasing was the prospect that opened to her view; to be blest with the power of shewing her gratitude to her friends, her piety to her mother; to repay her sister's unkindness with acts of generosity; and indulge the benevolence of her heart in relieving every distress which fell within her power to relieve!
               These were the advantages which she promised herself in the change of her fortune, and for these her grateful heart lifted itself up every moment in thanks and praise to that providence that bestowed them on her.
               While Sophia was thus absorbed in thought, Dolly opened the door, and running up to her, eagerly cried,
Tell me true, my dear miss, has not Mr. Herbert brought you some good news?

I am sure he has; I never saw him so joyful in my life: and you look glad too,
pursued she, peering in her face with a sweet earnestness.
May I not ask you, Miss Darnley, what this good news is?
               
               "You may, my dear," said So-phia smiling,
but not now; you shall know all soon. At pre-sent I would rather talk of your affairs.
               
               
                  Indeed I am greatly obliged to you, miss,
said Dolly,
for what you have done for me. Mrs. Gibbons seems almost as kind to me as ever she was, and you have talked so sensibly to my mo-ther, that she repents of her be-haviour to Mrs. Gibbons: and she likes Mr. William so well, that I am sure she would be glad to be reconciled to her.
               
               
                  

                  That is what I have been la-bouring at all this time,
resum-ed Sophia.
If Mrs. Lawson can be persuaded to make some conces-sions to the fantastick old gentle-woman, all may go well yet: it shall be my care to bring them together; and if my endeavours to produce a reconciliation fail, perhaps I may be able to engage a more powerful mediator in your interest.
               
               Sophia had Sir Charles in her thoughts, who she doubted not would readily undertake the cause of the distressed lovers, and possibly add something to her Dolly's porti-on, to lessen the inequality there was between them in that point. She spoke with such a chearful confidence, that Dolly, full of hope and joy, thanked her with artless transports of gratitude that moved her even to tears.

The next day, though in expec-tation of seeing Sir Charles, her heart laboured with a thousand emotions; yet kindly attentive to the affairs of her friend, she re-solved to make Mrs. Gibbons a visit, to prepare the way for the hoped for interview between her and Mrs. Lawson. As soon as she had disengaged herself from Mr. Her-bert, she set out alone for Mrs. Gibbons's house; but scarcely had she crossed the first field when she saw William, who who was as usual, sauntering about Mr. Lawson's grounds, in hopes of seeing his mis-tress.
               Sophia beckoned to him, and he eagerly flew to meet her; for, next to Dolly, he thought her the most charming woman in the world; and he adored her for the goodness with which she interested herself in his and his Dolly's happiness.
               
                  
When he drew near, Sophia told him she was going to visit his aunt; the youth respectfully expressed his concern that his aunt could not have that honour; she was gone, he said, to visit a relation who lived a few miles up the country.
               Sophia then told him the design upon which she was going, and the favourable disposition Mrs. Lawson was in. "I am persuaded," said she,
all might be made up, if we could but bring them toge-ther. Mrs. Lawson only wants opportunity to repair her fault; but how shall we contrive to give her this opportunity? what expe-dient can we find out to overcome your aunt's obstinacy, and prevail upon her to enter Mrs. Lawson's door again?
               
               "I know one, madam," said the youth,
which I think would do.
               
               
                  
Sophia concluding from the ti-midity of his look, that she was concerned in this expedient, prest him to speak freely, assuring him she would assist to the utmost of her power.
               "My aunt, madam," said he,
is as you know a great observer of forms: she would not for the world fall under the censure of having failed in any part of cere-mony or good breeding; now, madam, if you would be pleased to make a point of her return-ing your visit, and permit me to tell her that you are offended with her neglect, and that you insist upon this proof of her po-liteness, I am persuaded she will come.
               
               "Well," said Sophia, smiling,
if you are of opinion this will do, you have my consent to say whatever you think will affect her

most; make me as angry and as ceremonious as you please.
               
               
                  Nothing shall be wanting on my part to promote the success of this affair,
added she, with a graver look and accent;
for I believe you have a sincere affec-tion for my young friend, and I shall not be at rest till I see you both happy.
               
               The youth, in whose breast the sweet benevolence of her looks and words excited the strongest tran-sports of gratitude, not able to find words to express his sense of her goodness, suddenly threw himself at her feet, and kissed her hand with a mixture of tenderness and awe.
               Sophia, smiling at this sally, step-ped back a little; upon which he rose up, and, with a graceful con-fusion, paid her his thanks: she again repeated her promise of serv-ing him, and took leave: he bow-ed

low, following her for some time with his eyes, and sent a thousand kind wishes after her.
               Sophia, at her return, acquaint-ed Dolly with what had passed be-tween her lover and her, and filled her with pleasing hopes of the suc-cess of his scheme: but now the day wore away, she was in conti-nual expectation of seeing Sir Charles; her heart throbbed with anxiety; every noise she heard, sounded like the trampling of horses, and then an universal trembling would seize her. She dreaded, yet wished for his ar-rival; and at every disappointment she sighed, and felt her heart sink with tender despondency.
               Such were her agitations, till the evening being far advanced, she gave up all hope of his coming that night. Mr. Herbert had assigned a very pleasing reason for his visit being deferred till the next day;

and, her mind growing more com-posed, she went in search of the good old man, who, Dolly told her, was gone to walk in the meadows behind the house; for she had kept herself out of his sight as much as possible, unwilling that he should observe her emotions. She saw him at a distance, walking with a slow pace, and she perceived he observed her; but to her great surprize, she saw him cross into another field, and take a quite contrary way, on purpose to avoid her.
               Struck with this little accident, she stood still, and paused a few mo-ments: she felt herself strangely alarmed, yet wondered why she should be so, and took her way back again to the house with sad fore-bodings on her mind.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXII. Sophia suspects the Cause of her Lover's mysterious Conduct.
               WHEN Mr. Herbert returned from his walk, and met the curate and his little family at supper, Sophia, who heedfully ob-served him, saw an alteration in his countenance, which realized all her melancholy apprehensions, and con-vinced her that some new misfor-tune awaited her: his eyes, which studiously avoided her's, expressed nothing but grief and confusion; but he retired so early to his cham-ber, that Sophia, finding there was no hopes of explaining himself that night, passed it in an anxiety of mind, which suffered her not to taste the least repose. Early in the morning he knocked at her door,

and desired her to join him in the garden; she was already drest, and instantly complied.
               As soon as she came up to him, he took her hand, and pressed it af-fectionately, but spoke not a word.
               Sophia, who feared as much as she wished to know what had hap-pened, had not power to ask for an explanation; so they both conti-nued silent for some minutes.
               At length Mr. Herbert told her he was going to London; Sophia, in a faultering accent, asked him what had happened to occasion this sudden resolution?
               "Alas! my dear child," said the good old man, in great emotion,
I am ashamed and grieved to tell you thatâ€”Sir Charles has, I fear, deceived me.
               
               Although Sophia had reason to expect some sad reverse of fortune, and had endeavoured to prepare her-self

for it, yet this fatal confirma-tion of her fears shocked her so much, that Mr. Herbert, who saw a death-like paleness overspread her face, and felt her hand cold and trembling, fearing she would faint, made haste to lead her to a little bench of turf which was near them.
               Sophia recovering, saw so much concern in his looks, that struggling to repress her own anguish, she en-deavoured to comfort him, and, smiling through the tears that filled her charming eyes,
Let not this instance of my weakness alarm you, sir,
said she;
and doubt not but, with the assistance of heaven, I shall bear this strange insult with proper fortitude.
               
               
                  How worthy are you, my good child, of better fortune!
said Mr. Herbert; then taking a letter out of his pocket,
My first de-sign, pursued he,
was to seek

some explanation of this myste-rious letter, before I made you acquainted with it, but I per-ceived that my too apparent un-easiness had alarmed you, and I thought it would be less cruel to inform you of the whole matter than to leave you in doubt and un-certainty: this letter was deliver-ed to me yesterday in the even-ing, by one of Sir Charles's ser-vants, just as I was walking out towards the road, in hopes of meeting his master. My sur-prise at receiving a letter, when I expected to see himself, made me open it instantly, without ask-ing the servant any questions, and while I was reading it he went away, doubtless being directed to do so.
               
               Mr. Herbert then gave the letter to Sophia, who, unfolding it with trembling emotion, found it was as follows:

                           SIR,
                        
                        Since it is impossible my mar-riage with Miss Sophia can ever take place, I could wish you would look upon all that passed between us upon that subject, as a dream: I dreamt indeed, when I ima-gined there was a woman in the world capable of a sincere attach-ment; and I ought to be asham-ed to own, that upon so delusive a hope I was ready to act in op-position to the general maxims of the world, and be pointed at as a silly romantic fellow. However, I beg you will assure the young lady, that as I have no right to blame her conduct, so I have not the least resentment for it, and am so perfectly at ease on this occasion, that I can with great

sincerity congratulate her on her approaching happiness.
                        
                           I am, Sir,
                           Your humble servant, CHARLES STANLEY.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Although this letter gave Sophia a sad certainty of her misfortune, yet it relieved her from those worst pangs which a heart in love can feel, the belief of being abandoned through indifference, or inconstan-cy. Unperceived by ourselves, pride mixes with our most tender affec-tions, and either aggravates or les-sens the sense of every disappoint-ment, in proportion as we feel our-selves humbled by the circumstances that attend it.
               The ill-disguised jealousy, the personated calmness, the struggling

resentment that appeared in this letter, convinced Sophia that Sir Charles was far from being at ease, and that to whatever cause his pre-sent unaccountable behaviour was owing, yet she was sure at least of not being indifferent to him.
               It was not difficult to perceive that he had been deceived by some malicious reports, and her suspicions fell immediately upon Harriot; but rejecting this thought, as too in-jurious to her sister, she returned the letter to Mr. Herbert without speak-ing a word, but with a look much more serene and composed than be-fore.
               Mr. Herbert, who saw nothing in this letter like what her pene-tration had discovered, and who conceived it to be only a poor arti-fice to disengage himself from pro-mises which he now repented of,

was surprised to find her so much less affected with it than expected, and asked her what she thought of it?
               Sophia told him, that she was fully persuaded Sir Charles had been prejudiced against her.
               "Do you think so, my dear," said he, after a little pause;
then it is your sister to whom you are obliged for this kind of-fice.
               
               "I hope not, sir," replied So-phia, sighing;
that circumstance would aggravate my concernâ€” indeed I think it would be a crime in me to suspect her of being capable of such unkind-ness.
               
               "Well," resumed Mr. Herbert,
I will, if possible, discover this mystery before night; you shall hear from me to-morrow; in the

mean time calm your mind, and resign yourself entirely to that Providence, which, while you continue thus good and virtuous, will never forsake you.
               
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XVI. Sophia is visited by Mrs. Gibbons, and makes new Discoveries.
               MR. Herbert now left her, to go and take leave of the cu-rate and his family; and Sophia, whose fortune had undergone so many revolutions in so short a time, retired to her chamber, where she passed great part of the day alone, at once to indulge her melan-choly, and to conceal it from ob-servation.
               In the afternoon Dolly came up, in a great hurry of spirits, to ac-quaint her that Mrs. Gibbons was come to wait upon her; that she had been met at the door by her mother, and that several courtesies had passed between them.
               The poor girl, though transport-ed

with joy at this favourable be-ginning, no sooner perceived, by the pensive air in Sophia's coun-tenance, and the sighs that escaped her, that her suspicions of some new disappointment having hap-pened to her were true, than in-stantly forgetting the prosperous situation of her own affairs, her sweet face was overspread with ten-der grief, and a tear stole from her eyes; but Sophia, whom nothing could have awakened from that stupifying sorrow in which any great and sudden misfortune plunges the mind, but the desire of being useful to her friends, soon assumed a more chearful look, and hastened to receive her visitor.
               Mrs. Gibbons was in full dress, and had omitted no superfluous or-nament that could serve to shew Sophia how well she understood every sort of punctilio. As soon as

the first compliments were over, "You see, madam," said she,
what affluence your commands have over me: I once little thought that I should ever have entered this impolished house again; my nephew attended me to the door, but I would not suffer him to come in, because I am not sure that you are willing to let these people know the ho-nour you do him by receiving his adorations.
               
               Sophia, though a little startled at these words, yet supposed she had no particular meaning in them, and ascribed all to her fantastick manner of expressing herself; but Mrs. Gibbons being resolved to hasten the conclusion of an affair which she had very much at heart, spoke so intelligibly at last, that Sophia could no longer be ignorant of her design, all the ill consequences

of which suddenly striking her ima-gination, she exclaimed in a tone of surprise and terror,
Sure I am the most unfortunate creature in the world! is it possible, Mrs. Gib-bons, that you can be serious? have you really given any cause for a report, that I receive your nephew's addresses? if you have, you have done me an irreparable injury.
               
               Sophia's spirits were so greatly a-gited that she did not perceive how much of her situation these words discovered; so that Mrs. Gibbons, who saw the tears flow fast from her eyes, immediately comprehended the whole truth.
               "I see plainly," said she, in great concern,
that I have been deceived, and others perhaps have been so too; I shall never discapitulate myself for being the cause of any misfortune to you:

some more advantageous treatise has been on the tapestry, and this unlucky affair has done mischief.
               
               
                  Give me leave to ask you, madam,
interrupted Sophia with some peevishness,
what founda-tion had you for believing that I considered your nephew as my lover? you know his heart has been long since engaged.
               
               
                  I acknowledge I have been to blame, my dear miss,
resumed Mrs. Gibbons,
I was too san-guinary in my hopes; but I beg you will disclaim no more, this will do no good; only tell me if it is possible to repair the harm I have done by my foolish schemes.
               
               To this Sophia made no answer; but Mrs. Gibbons, who wanted neither tenderness nor candour, and who was greatly concerned at the uneasiness she saw her under, urged her so frequently, and with so much

earnestness, to tell her if she could be of any use in clearing up a mis-take that had possibly been disad-vantageous to her, that Sophia, still attentive amidst all her own dis-tresses to the interest of her friend, thought this a favourable opportu-nity to serve her; and therefore told Mrs. Gibbons, that if she was really sincere in her offers, there was one way.
               "I understand you, madam," interrupted Mrs. Gibbons,
and I believe I may venture to say that I thought of this expedition be-fore you did. I cannot, indeed, Miss Darnley, I cannot consent to my nephew's marriage with the young woman here; you know I have been affronted.
               
               Sophia now urged some argu-ments in favour of Mrs. Lawson, but chiefly rested her defence upon her ignorance of those forms of po-liteness

and good breeding which Mrs. Gibbons was so perfectly mistress of.
               This compliment put the old lady into so good a humour, that she cried out,
Well, my dear Miss Darnley, in regard to you, I will take off the probition I laid on my nephew to visit here no more; and this I hope,
added she smiling,
will set matters right in another place; as for the rest, I shall take no resolution till I see how they behave.
               
               Sophia, in her transport at hav-ing succeeded so well with the old lady, felt all her own griefs sus-pended; and indeed, when she re-flected upon what had happened with regard to herself, she found she had less cause for reflection than Mr. Herbert, or her own fears, had suggested.
               Mrs. Gibbons acknowledged that

she had flattered herself with the hope of her nephew's being well received by her; and that, in con-sequence of it, she had talked of their marriage as an event which was very likely to happen, and which would give her great joy. Sophia, being fully persuaded that these reports had reached Sir Charles, though by what means she was not so well able to determine, easily ac-counted for that jealousy and re-sentment which had produced so strange an inconsistency in his be-haviour, and which Mr. Herbert considered as a piece of artifice to palliate his lightness and inconstancy.
               The good old man, animated by his affection for the poor afflicted Sophia, rode with the utmost speed to town, and alighted at the house of the young baronet. The ser-vants informed him, that their master was in the country, which

was all the intelligence they could give him: for they neither knew where he was, nor when he would return. Mr. Herbert, perplexed and concerned at this new disap-pointment, repaired immediately to Mrs. Darnley's, hoping to hear some news of him there.
               Harriot, in answer to his en-quiries, told him with an air of triumph, that the same day they returned from visiting Sophia, Sir Charles had waited on her mam-ma and her, and had as usual past great part of the afternoon with them.
               Mr. Herbert, who was struck with this incident, endeavoured to make some discoveries concerning their conversation, and Harriot's malice made this no difficult mat-ter: for she could not forbear throwing out some sarcasms against her sister, whose extreme sensibility,

she insinuated, had already found out a new object.
               Mr. Herbert, by his artful ques-tions, drew her into a confession of all that had passed between her and the baronet upon this subject; and was convinced that her ma-lignant hints had poisoned his mind with suspicions unfavourable to Sophia.
               He went away full of indigna-tion at her treachery, and still doubtful of Sir Charles's sincerity, who he could not suppose would have been so easily influenced by Harriot's suggestions, (whose en-vious disposition he well knew,) if his intentions had been absolute-ly right.
               The next morning he received a letter from Sophia, in which she acquainted him with the discove-ries she had made; and modestly hinted her belief that Sir Charles

had been imposed upon by this report of her intended marriage, which she found was spread through the village; and which, as it was very probable, he had intelligence from thence, had confirmed any idle raillery to that purpose, which her sister might have indulged her-self in.
               Mr. Herbert reflecting upon all these unlucky circumstances, began to suppose it possible that Sir Charles had been really deceived. He went again to his house, but had the mortification to hear from a servant whom he had not seen the day before, that the baronet was at his seat inâ€”
               Thither the good old man re-solved to go; the inconveniencies and expence of such a journey, which in his years, and narrow circumstances were not inconsi-derable, had not weight enough

with him to make him balance a moment whether he should transact this affair by letter, or in person. The happiness of his dear and amiable charge depend-ed upon his success: he therefore delayed no longer than to make the necessary preparations for his journey, and, after writing to So-phia to acquaint her with his de-sign, he set out for Sir Charles's seat, where he met with a new and more severe disappointment. The first news he heard was, that the baronet was not in that part of the country; and upon a fuller enquiry of his servants, he was informed that their master had the morning before set out for Dover with an intention to go to Paris.
               Mr. Herbert, dispirited with this news, and fatigued with his fruit-less journey, retired to his inn,

where he passed the lonely hours in melancholy reflections upon the capricious behaviour of Sir Charles, and the undeserved distresses of the innocent Sophia.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXIV. Displays certain singularities in the character of Sophia, and their ef-fects on the heart of Sir Charles.
               SIR Charles, however, notwith-standing appearances, was at present more unhappy than guilty. His resolution to marry Sophia, though suddenly formed, was not the less sincere: he had always loved her with the most ardent pas-sion, and had not the light charac-ter of her mother and sister con-curred with those prejudices which his youth, his fortune, and his converse with the gay world led him into, his heart, which had never ceased to do homage to her virtue, would have sooner suggested to him the only means of being truly happy.
               
                  
An overstrained delicacy likewise proved another source of dis-quietude to him. The inequality of their circumstances gave rise to a thousand tormenting doubts: he was afraid, that dazzled with the splendor of his fortune, she would sacrifice her inclinations to her in-terest, and give him her hand with-out her heart; and when doing jus-tice to the greatness of her mind, and the real delicacy of her senti-ments, he rejected this supposition as injurious to her, his busy imagi-nation conjured up new forms of distrust: he trembled left, mistak-ing gratitude for love, she should be deceived by her own generosity and nice sense of obligation, and ima-gine it was the lover she preferred, when the benefactor only touched her heart.
               Such was the perplexed state of his mind, when Mrs. Darnley and

Harriot proposed making her a visit. With some difficulty he conquered his desire of accompanying them; but his impatience to hear of her, carried him again to Mrs. Darnley's much earlier in the evening than it was likely they would return; pre-suming on his intimacy in the fa-mily, he scrupled not to go up stairs, telling the servant he would wait till the ladies came home.
               He sat down in the dining-room, where he gazed on Sophia's picture a long time. At last a sudden fancy seized him to visit her apartment, which he knew was on the second floor: he ascended the stairs with-out being perceived, and with a tender emotion entered the room where his beloved Sophia used to pass so many of her retired hours.
               It was still elegantly neat, as when its lovely inmate was there; for

Harriot, who hated this room be-cause it contained so many monu-ments of her sister's taste and indus-try, never went into it; and it re-mained in the same order that she had left it.
               The first thing that drew the young baronet's attention, was a fire-screen of excellent workman-ship; it was a flower-piece, and executed with peculiar taste and propriety: the wainscot was adorned with several drawings, neatly fram-ed and glassed. In this art Sophia took great delight, having while her farther lived appropriated all her pocket money to the payment of a master to instruct her in it. Sir Charles considered the subjects of these drawings with a peculiar plea-sure. The delicate pencil of So-phia had here represented the Vir-tues and the Graces, from those lively ideas which existed in her own charming mind.
               
                  
Her little library next engaged his notice: many of the books that composed it he had presented her; but he was curious to see those which her own choice had directed her to, and in this examination he met with many proofs of her piety as well as of the excellence of her taste.
               Several compositions of her own now fell into his hands: he read them with eagerness, and, charm-ed with this discovery of those trea-sures of wit, which she with mo-dest diffidence so carefully concealed, he felt his admiration and tenderness for her encrease every moment.
               While he was anxiously searching for more of her papers, a little sha-green case fell from one of the shelves upon the ground. He took it up, and as every thing that be-longed to her excited his curiosity, he opened it immediately, and with

equal surprise and pleasure, saw his own miniature in water colours, which was evidently the perfor-mance of Sophia herself.
               Had it been possible for her to imagine the sudden and powerful effect the sight of this picture would have upon the heart of Sir Charles, she would not have suffered so much uneasiness for the loss of it as she really had; for, forgetting where she had laid it, she supposed it had dropt out of her pocket, and was apprehensive of its hav-ing fallen into her sister's hands, who she knew would not fail to turn this incident to her disad-vantage.
               While Sir Charles gazed upon this artless testimony of Sophia's affection for him, the softest gra-titude, the tenderest compassion, filled his soul. "Oh, my So-phia,"
said he,
do you then

truly love me! and have I cruelly trifled with your tender-ness!
               
               This thought melted him even to tears; he felt in himself a de-testation of those depraved prin-ciples which had suggested to him a design of debasing such purity! he wondered at the hardness of his own heart, that could so long resist the influence of her gentle virtues, and suffer such sweet sen-sibility to waste itself in anxi-ous doubts, and disappointed hope.
               Being now determined to do justice to her merit, and make himself happy, his first design was to go immediately to Mr. Lawson's; but, reflecting that Sophia had great reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct; and that, to remove her prejudices,

the utmost caution and delicacy was to be observed, he conceived it would be more proper to make a direct application to Mr. Her-bert, whom she loved and reve-renced as a father, than to pre-sent himself before her, while her mind yet laboured with those unfavourable suspicions for which he had given but too much cause; and hence new fears and doubts arose to torment him. He dread-ed lest her just resentment for his injurious designs should have weak-ened those tender impressions she had once received; and that, in the pride of offended virtue, every softer sentiment would be lost.
               Impatient of this cruel state of suspense and inquietude, he left Sophia's apartment, and repairing to the dining-room, rang the bell

for the servant, of whom he en-quired where Mr. Herbert lodged. Having obtained a direction, he went immediately to the house; Mr. Herbert was not at home, and Sir Charles, grieved at this disappointment, and at Mrs. Darnley's not returning that night, from whom he hoped to have heard some news of Sophia; the agitation of his mind made him think it an age till the next day, in which he determined to put an end to all his perplexities, and to fix his fate.
               After his interview with Mr. Herbert, and the good old man's departure, to prepare Sophia for his intended visit, the young ba-ronet resigned his whole soul to tenderness and joy. His impati-ence to see Sophia encreased with his hope of finding her senti-ments

for him unchanged, and he regretted a thousand times his having suffered Mr. Herbert to go away without him.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXV. Lets the reader into some circum-stances that help to display Sir Charles's conduct.
               MEAN time a card came from Mrs. Darnley and Harriot, acquainting him that they were re-turned, and thanking him for the use of his servants and chariot. Sir Charles, eager to hear news of his Sophia, went immediately to wait on them; and scarce were the first compliments over, when he enquir-ed for her with such apparent emo-tion, that, Harriot mortified to the last degree, resolved to be even with him, and said every thing that she thought would torment him, and prejudice her sister.
               She told him that Sophia was the most contented creature in the

world; and that she was so charmed with her present way of life, and her new companions, that she seemed to have forgot all her old friends, and even her relations.
She is grown a meer country girl,
said she,
is always wan-dering about in the fields and meadows, followed by a young rustic who has fallen in love with her. I rallied her a little upon her taste; but I found she could not bear it, and indeed he is ex-tremely handsome, and she says, has had a genteel education.
               
               Harriot was at once pleased and grieved at observing the effect these insinuations had on Sir Charles; his colour changed, he trembled, and fixing his eyes on the ground, he remained pensive and silent, while Harriot, notwithstanding her mo-ther's insignificant frowns, proceed-ed in a malicious detail of little cir-cumstances

partly invented, and partly mistaken, which fixed the sharpest stings of jealousy in his heart.
               If in dealing with cunning per-sons we were always to consider their ends, in order to interpret their speeches, much of their arti-fice would lose its effect; but Sir Charles had so contemptible an opi-nion of Harriot's understanding, that although he knew she was ma-licious, he never suspected her of being capable of laying schemes to gratify her malice; and did not sup-pose she was mistress of invention enough to form so plausible a tale as that she had told.
               Impatient under those cruel doubts which now possessed him, he resolved to go, late as it was in the evening, to Mr. Lawson's house; and taking an abrupt leave of Mrs. Darnley and her daughter, he went

home, and ordered his horses to be got ready. He scarce knew his own design by taking this journey at so improper a time; but in the ex-treme agitation of his mind, the first idea of relief that naturally presented itself was to see Sophia, who alone could destroy or confirm his fears; and this he eagerly pur-sued without any farther reflection.
               The servant to whom he had sent his orders, made no haste to exe-cute them, as conceiving it to be a most extravagant whim in his mas-ter to set out upon a journey so late, and in that manner. While he with studied delays protracted the time, hoping for some change in his reso-lutions, Sir Charles racked with impatience, counted moments for hours; message after message was dispatched to the groom. The horses at length were brought, and Sir Charles, with only one servant,

galloped away, never stopping till he came to the place where Sophia resided.
               It was now night, and the inde-corum of making a visit at such a time in a family where he was a stranger, first striking his thoughts, he resolved to alight at an inn which he saw at a small distance, and there consider what it was best for him to do.
               A guest of his appearance soon engaged the attention of the host and his wife. They quitted two men with whom they had been talking, and, with a great deal of officious civility, attended upon Sir Charles, who desired to be shewn into a room. As he was following the good woman, who declared he should have the best in her house, the two persons before mentioned, bowed to him when he passed by

them; the salute of the younger having a certain grace in it that drew his attention, he looked back on him, and at the sight of a very handsome face, and a person un-commonly genteel, his heart, by its throbbing emotions, immediately suggested to him, that this beau-tiful youth was the lover of his So-phia.
               The jealousy which Harriot's in-sinuations had kindled in his heart, now raged with redoubled force; this rival, whom she had called a rustic, and whom he fondly hoped to find such, possessed the most at-tractive graces of form, and proba-bly wanted neither wit nor polite-ness. Sophia's youth, her tender-ness, her sensibility, wounded by his dissembled indifference, and the cruel capriciousness of his conduct, all disposed her to receive a new

impression, and who so proper to touch her heart as this lovely youth, whose passion, as innocent as it was ardent and sincere, banished all doubt and suspicion, and left her whole soul open to the soft pleadings of gratitude and love?
               While he was wholly absorbed in these tormenting reflections, and incapable of taking any resoluti-on, the officious landlady entered his chamber to take his orders for supper.
               Sir Charles, surprised to find it was so late, resolved to stay there all night, and after giving the good woman some directions, his restless curiosity impelled him to ask her several questions con-cerning the old man and the youth whom he had seen talking to her.
               
                  
The hostess, who was as com-municative as he could desire, told him, that the old man was one farmer Gibbons, of whom she had been buying a load of hay; that the young one was his son, and a great scholard.
His aunt, pursued she, breeds him up to be a gentleman; and she has a power of money, and designs to leave it all to him, much good may it do him, for he is as handsome a young man as one would desire to see. Some time ago it was all over our town that he was go-ing to be married to the parson's youngest daughter, and she is a pretty creature, and disarves him if he was more richer and hand-somer than he is; but whatever is the matter, the old folks have changed their mind, and his

aunt, they say, wants to make up a match between him and a fine London lady that boards at the parson's; but I'll never believe it till I see it, for she and the par-son's daughter are great friends, they say, and it would not be a friendly part to rob the poor girl of her sweetheart. To say the truth, I believe there is some juggling among them; but this I keep to myself, for I would not make mischief; therefore I never tell my thoughts to any body, but I wish the young folks well.
               
               Sir Charles, who had listened to her with great emotion, dis-missed her now, that he might be at liberty to reflect on what he had heard, which, although it did not lead him to a full discovery of the truth, yet it suggested thoughts which relieved

him in some degree from those dreadful pangs of jealousy with which he had hitherto been tortured, and ballanced at least his fears and his hopes.
            
            
               

               
                  CHAP. XXVI. The Baronet's Jealousy accounted for: he leaves England.
               HIS impatience to free himself from this state of perplexity and suspence, allowed him but little repose that night; he rose as soon as the day appeared, and it was with some difficulty that he prevailed up-on himself to defer his visit till a sea-sonable hour; and then being in-formed that Mr. Lawson's house was scarce a mile distant, he left his ser-vant and horses at the inn, and walk-ed thither, amidst a thousand anxi-ous thoughts, which made him dread as much as he wished for an i

                  ter-view, which was to decide his fate.
               As he drew near the house, he perceived a young man sauntering

about in an adjacent field, whose air and mien had a great resemb-lance of the youth whom he had seen in the inn. Sir Charles, eager to satisfy his doubts, followed him at a distance, and the youth turning again his wishing eyes towards the house, the baronet had a full view of his face.
               At the sight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his breast: he hastily retreated be-hind a hedge, determined to watch his motions; for he imagined, and with reason, that he came there to meet his mistress; and who that mi-stress was, whether Sophia, or the curate's daughter, was the distract-ing doubt, which he now expected to have satisfied.
               He walked along by the side of the hedge, still keeping William in sight, who suddenly turning back, rather flew than ran to meet a wo-man

It is not perhaps very necessary to enquire whether the Vehicle of so much Delight and Instruction be a Story probable, or unlikely, native, or foreign. Shakespear's Excellence is not the Fiction of a Tale, but the Re-presentation of Life; and his Repu-tation is therefore safe, till Human Nature shall be changed. Nor can he who has so many just Claims to Praise, suffer by losing that which ignorant Admiration has unreasonably given him. To calumniate the Dead is Baseness, and to flatter them is surely Folly.
            From Flattery, my Lord, either of the Dead or the Living, I wish to be clear, and have therefore soli-cited the Countenance of a Patron, whom, if I knew how to praise

he was no longer able to stand, but letting himself gently sink on the Ground, and look-ing piteously in the Face of his afflicted Wife, "Alas! said he, my Love,â€”I am dying."
               Friar Lorenzo, who, for what Reason is unknown, was not willing to take Julietta out of the Monument, and carry her to his Cham-ber the Night she was interred, the following Night finding Romeo did not appear, accom-panied by a faithful Brother of the Order, he came to the Monument with Instruments to break open the Vault, and arrived there the same Moment that Romeo sunk down upon the Earth, and seeing it already opened, and Pietro standing by it, he asked him where Ro-meo was.
               
                  Julietta hearing the Voice, and knowing is to be the Friar's, raising her Head, and weep-ing, said, "Heaven pardon you, how well you sent the Letter to Romeo!"
               
               "I sent it, replied he, by Friar Anselmo, with whom you are acquainted; wherefore then do you speak to me in this Manner?"
               "Descend, replied Julietta, (redoubling her Tears) and see."
               The Friar going down, immediately per-ceived Romeo stretched out, having yet some small Remainder of Life; "Oh, my Son! Oh, Romeo! cried he, what does this mean?"
               
                  Romeo, opening his languishing Eyes, and knowing the Friar, with Tears which ran fast down his dying Cheeks, recommended Ju-lietta to his Care, and devoutly asked Pardon of God and him for the Offence he had been guilty of in hastening his own Death.
               
                  
It was with great Difficulty the unhappy Lo-ver pronounced these last Words, which, as soon as he had finished, he expiredâ€”Julietta, shrieking aloud, and calling many Times on the Name of her loved Husband, oppressed at last with agonizing Grief, fell fainting on his Body, and continued so long in that State of Insensibility, that the two Friars and Pietro, who were busied in giving her all the Assistance they were able, thought she was dead: Re-covering however to a painful Sense of Woe, she wildly wrung her Hands, tore off her Hair, and bathed the lifeless Body with her Tears; then clasping him to her throbbing Bosomâ€” "Oh thou loved Center of all my Wishes, said she, my dear, my only Lord, once the sole Bliss of my Life, now, ah! now my on-ly Misery!â€”How art thou cut off in the Spring of Youth, and early Bloom of Beau-ty!â€”Thou, at a Time when all are fondest of Life, hast willingly shortened thy Course; and me, me, the unhappy Cause!â€”Yes, my dearest Lord, thou didst come to finish thy Days in the Arms of her, who, in Life, thou hadst loved most, and who loved thee above all earthly Thingsâ€”Hither thou didst come to breathe thy last Sighs, and to be interred near me; not suspecting these bitter Tears would have bewailed thee deadâ€”Where art thou now, my Love?â€”Art thou not still with me?â€”I know thou artâ€”Thou can'st not stay in a Place where I am notâ€”Thy dear Spirit still wanders about meâ€”I seeâ€”I hear theeâ€”Thou wonderest at my long Stayâ€”Fear not, my dearest Lord, but I will follow thee: The

most painful Death that could be inflicted on me would not equal the Torments of living without theeâ€”I come then, I come, my only Loveâ€”Stay one Moment for me; that my freed Soul may mount with thine, and be with thee for ever."
               The two Friars and Pietro, wholly subdued by Grief, wept excessively at this dismal Scene; yet they used their utmost Endeavours to comfort her, but all in vain.
               "My Daughter, said Father Lorenzo, what is done cannot now be undone: If Tears could recal thy Romeo to Life, ours should flow as fast as thine; but there is no Remedy for what is past; comfort thyself then and re-solve to live; and if thou art not willing to return to thy Father's House, I will place thee in a holy Monastery, where thou may'st spend the Remainder of thy Life in serving God, and praying for the Soul of Romeo."
               
               
                  Julietta, whose Thoughts were wholly swallowed up in the blackest Despair, heard with gloomy Silence all the Friar had been saying, and, obstinately bent on Death, col-lecting her whole Force of Grief, and vio-lently restraining all the Powers of Life, she expired, holding her Romeo fast locked in her Arms.
               While the two Friars and Pietro were endeavouring to recover her, some Soldiers passing that way by Chance, alarmed by the Light they saw in the Monument, ran hastily thither; being informed of what had happened to the unfortunate Lovers, they left the Friars under a good Guard, and took Pietro
                  

along with them to the Prince, to whom he minutely related their whole History.
               The Morn being now come, the whole Ci-ty was filled with Grief and Consternation at this melancholy Adventure; the People ran in Crouds to the Monument of the Capelletti; and the Prince being resolved that one Grave should hold the faithful Lovers, their Funeral Obsequies were performed with great Pomp by the two distressed Families of the Montecchi and Capelletti, between whom there was after-wards a transient Peace. The Friar and Pie-tro were pardoned, and the Father of Romeo, in every Particular, fulfilled the dying Re-quests of his beloved Son.
            
            
               

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.
               
               ON the Incidents in the foregoing Novel, Shakespear has formed the Fable of his Ro-meo and Juliet, one of the most regular of all his Tragedies. How closely he has followed the Story may be partly seen by this Translation, which is literal from the Original Italian of Bandello; yet I think it will not be difficult to prove, or at least to make it appear highly pro-bable, that he never saw, and did not understand the Original, but copied from a French Tran-slation extant in his Time; or, what is equally probable, from an English Translation of that French one, both very bad, in some Places rather paraphrased than translated; in others, the Author's Sense absolutety mistaken, many Circumstances injudiciously added, and many more altered for the worse, or wholly omitted. The Story of Romeo and Juliet may be found translated in a Book, entituled, Histoires Tra-giques extraictes des Oeuvres de Bandel, printed in Paris, in the Year 1571, seven Years after Shakespear was born. A literal Translation of

this Story, from the French, is in the second Tome of the Palace of Pleasure, printed at London in the Year 1567, which is a Col-lection of Novels, translated into English by William Painter, from several Greek, Latin, Spanish and Italian Authors (as the Title Page says) but some of them are taken from Translations of those Authors into French, of which Romeo and Juliet is one.
               Had Shakespear ever seen the original Novel in Bandello, he would have been sensible that the Translation of it is extremely bad: That he did not see it, must be owing to nothing else than his not understanding Italian; for can it be supposed, that having resolved to write a Tragedy upon the Subject of an Itali-an Story, he would rather chuse to copy from a bad Translation of that Story, than follow the Original.
               This Supposition would be as absurd as to imagine a Man would slake his Thirst with the muddy Waters of a polluted Stream, when the clear Spring, from whence it issues, is with-in his Reach. That Shakespear consulted the Translator, appears from his having followed him in all the Alterations he has made in the Original; some few of which I shall take no-tice of, and shew that in some Places he has not only taken Circumstances from the Trans-lator, but also made Use of his Thoughts and Expressions.
               In Bandello the Lovers pass the Night af-ter their Nuptials in the Garden; the Trans-lator makes Romeo ascend the Chamber of

                  Julietta, in which he is followed by Shake-spear.
               
               The Translation makes them both com-plain of the Tediousness of the Day, wish the Sun to hasten his Course, or that they were able to add Wings to his Speed; Bandello is silent upon the Subject, but Shakespear puts al-most the same Words in the Mouth of Ju-liet.
               
               The Translator makes Juliet, upon hearing that her Cousin is slain by Romeo, break into Complaints and Reproaches against her Hus-band, and after she has for some Time given a Loose to her Resentment, her returning Ten-derness for Romeo forces her to repent of the injurious Words which, in the first Emotions of her Grief and Rage, she had uttered against him; she condemns herself for her too hasty Censure, and begs Pardon of the absent Romeo for her unkind Reproaches.
               There is not the least Foundation for all this in the Original. Bandello every where shews Juliet so much engrossed by her extreme Passion for Romeo, that all other Affections, all Tyes of Consanguinity, all filial Duty and Obedience is swallowed up in the Immensity of her Love; and therefore when the News of Tibbald's Death and Romeo's Banishment is brought to her at the same Time, she does not weep for the Death of her Cousin, but for the Banishment of her Husband. Shakespear has indeed the same Thought: Juliet being told by her Nurse, that her Parents were weeping over the dead Body of Tibbald, replies,

                     

                     Wash they his Wound with Tears; mine shall be spent
                     When their's are dry, for Romeo's Banish-ment.
                  
               
               Her superior Affection for Romeo is also painted by Shakespear in that Speech wherein she laments his Banishment, and acknowledges it is a greater Misfortune to her than the Death of all her Relations would be; but both these Circumstances the Translator has in common with Bandello: He differs from him in making Juliet complain of her Husband's Cruelty in killing her Cousin, and Shakespear has exactly followed that Hint.
               When the Father of Juliet is informed of his Daughter's Sorrow for having offended him in refusing Count Paris for her Husband, Shakespear makes him praise the good Friar, by whom he supposes all this Alteration was brought about, in almost the same Words of the Translator.
               
                  Now 'fore God, this reverend holy Friar,
                  Our whole City is much bound to him.
               
               This is not the first Benefit we have receiv-ed from this holy Man, to whom every Citi-zen in this Commonwealth is dearly bound."
               But in Bandello the Mother of Juliet only says, "That in Gratitude for the Friar's successful Admonitions they ought to make a

Present to his Monastery, which was very poor."
               In Bandello, the Friar, who is sent with the Letters to Romeo, is detained at a Monastery in Mantua: The Translator makes him be stopped at his own Convent in Verona; which last is followed by Shakespear.
               
               There is no Mention made in the Original of the Apothecary, of whom Romeo buys the Poison; there we are only told that he had mortal Drugs in his Possession, which was given him by a Spoletto Mountebank in Mantua, long before.
               The Translator makes him walk through the Streets in Mantua in order to find a Person that would sell him such a Composition, and accordingly he goes into the Shop of an Apo-thecary, whose Poverty is observable from the miserable Furniture of it; and he for a Bribe of fifty Ducats furnishes him with a strong Poison.
               
                  Shakespear has not only copied this Circum-stance from the Translator, but also borrowed some Hints from him in his celebrated Descrip-tion of the miserable Shop.
               These few Instances are sufficient to prove that Shakespear took the Incidents on which he has founded his Tragedy of Romeo and Ju-liet from the Translation; and consequently that he did not peruse, because he did not un-derstand, the original Italian.
               
               His Management of the Tomb Scene, and the Death of the two Lovers, is entirely co-pied from the Translator, who differs greatly from the Original in those Circumstances.

The plain and simple Narration of that melan-choly Event in Bandello is more natural, more pathetic, and fitter to excite the Passions of Pity and Terror, than the Catastrophe of the Tragedy, as managed by Shakespear, who has kept close by the Translator.
               In Bandello, when Pietro informs his Master of Juliet's Death, Astonishment and Grief for some Moments deprive him of Speech; reco-vering a little, he breaks into Complaints and Self-Reproaches; then, wild with Despair, he flies to his Sword, and endeavours to kill him-self, but being prevented by his Servant, he sinks into an Excess of silent Sorrow, and, while he weeps, calmly deliberates on the Means, he should use to die in the Monument with Juliet.
               
               The Translator makes Romeo, upon receive-ing the fatal News, resolve immediately to poison himself; and for that Purpose Romeo dissembles his Affliction, and tells his Servant he will go and walk about the Streets of Man-tua to divert himself; but his real Design is to procure some Poison, which having purchased of a poor Apothecary, he goes immediately to Verona.
               
               
                  Shakespear has here copied the Translator exactly, and makes Romeo in the Midst of his Affliction for the Death of his Wife, and while the horrible Design of killing himself was forming in his Mind, give a ludicrous Detail of the miserable Furniture of a poor Apothecary's Shop; a Description, however beautiful in itself, is here so ill timed, and so inconsistent with the Condition and Circum-stances

him, I could praise with Truth, and have the World on my Side; whose Candour and Humanity are universally acknowledged, and whose Judgment perhaps was then first to be doubted, when he condescended to admit this Address from,
            
               My Lord,
               Your Lordship's most obliged, and most obedient, humble Servant, The AUTHOR.
            
         
         
            

of the Speaker, that we cannot help being shocked at the Absurdity, though we admire the Beauty of the Imagination.
               There appears so much Contrivance and Method in Romeo's Design of buying Poison, and going to Verona to drink it in the Monu-ment of his Wife, that he might expire near her, that we can hardly suppose it to be the spontaneous Effect of a sudden and furious Transport of Grief. In the Original therefore we see him not taking this Resolution till the first violent Sallies of his Sorrow are abated; till after, in a sudden Transport of Despair, he had ineffectually endeavoured to fall upon his Sword; but while he forms that fatally re-gulated Design, he is dissolved in Tears, and plunged in a calm and silent Excess of Sor-row.
               The French Translator makes Romeo, when he breaks open the Monument where Juliet lies, command his Servant to be gone and leave him alone, fiercely menacing him with Death if he disobeys.
               
                  Shakespoar does more than imitate him here; for in the Play Romeo injudiciously adds a Rea-son for that Command; which so far from forcing Obedience, ought rather to have pre-vented it.
               
                  The Time and my Intents are savage wild;
                  More fierce, and more inexorable far
                  Than empty Tygers, or the roaring Sea.
               
               Yet Romeo, a few Lines above in the same Speech, condescends to dissemble with his

Servant as to the Cause of his going into the Monument.
               
                  Why I descend into this Bed of Death,
                  Is partly to behold my Lady's Face;
                  But chiefly to take thence from her dead Finger
                  A precious Ring, a Ring which I must use
                  In dear Employment.
               
               To pass by the Absurdity of those Contra-dictions, let us only compare this wild and in-consistent Behaviour of Romeo in the Transla-tion and the Play, with the calm, sedate, yet fixed Despair of Romeo in the Original.
               As soon as he has determined upon the Manner of his Death, he writes an affecting Letter to his Father, in which he relates the History of his Love and Marriage with Juliet-ta; entreats his Pardon for disposing of him-self without consulting him; provides hand-somely for all his Servants, particularly his Confident, Pietro; and earnestly entreats that he may be interred in the Monument with Juliet, where he goes to die.
               This done, taking the Letter and Poison with him, he goes to Verona, opens the Mo-nument by the Help of Pietro, and desiring him to watch in the Church-yard lest any Person should surprize him, he descends into the Vault; there, after tenderly gazing on his Wife, and giving some Moments to the Tears and Complaints which that sad Object drew from him, he drinks off the Poison; then ascending a few Steps, and leaning on the Side

of the Monument, he calls his Servant; tells him what he had done; gives him the Letter to his Father; assures him he will be well pro-vided for, at his dying Request; then taking Leave of him, descends again into the Vault, and clasping the Body of his Wife in his Arms, calls out to Pietro to close the Monu-ment upon him, and leave him to expire.
               There is something extremely affecting in this determined, yet calm, and (if the Ex-pression may be permitted) gentle Despair of Romeo, in the Original: His desiring to have the Monument closed upon him, while he is yet alive, that he may expire in the Arms of his beloved Juliet, is also beautifully pathetic, and consistent with that violent Passion he had for her when living.
               
                  Romeo, in the French and English Transla-slations, dies before Juliet awakes, and the Friar and Peter enters the Monument the same Moment that he expires; then Juliet awaking, they press her to leave the Monument, but she refusing, and they both being alarmed at the Approach of some Soldiers, cowardly run away, and Juliet, left alone, stabs herself with a Dag-ger.
               
                  Shakespear has copied all these Circumstan-ces from the Translator. Romeo dies in the Play before Juliet awakes; the Friar fearing to be discovered by the Watch, as he calls it, but there is no such Establishment in any of the Cities of Italy, presses her to leave the Monument; she refuses; he runs away; and she stabs herself with Romeo's Dagger.
               In Bandello, while the dying Husband is holding her lifeless Body, as he supposes, in his

Arms, and shedding his last Tears for her Death, she awakes; she opens her Eyes, gazes on him, and entreats him to carry her out of the Monument.
               
                  Romeo is for some Moments lost in a Tran-sport of Surprize and Joy to see her alive, but reflecting that he is poisoned, that he must shortly die and leave her, his Agonies return with double Force: How pathetically does he complain of his miserable Destiny! With what tender Extasy does he congratulate her Return to Life! With what affecting Sorrow lament his approaching Death, which must tear him from her! nor is the Astonishment, the Grief, and wild Despair of the wretched Juliet less beautifully imagined.
               The Speech of Romeo to the dead Body of Tibbald is very moving, and expressive of the Gentleness and Candour of his Disposition: His sinking from the Arms of his Wife when the Poison begins to exert all its Force; his falling extended at her Feet; gazing on her with a Look that seemed at once to give and ask Compassion; and gasping out "Alas! my Love, I die," is pathetic to the last De-gree.
               The Friar the same Moment arrives at the Monument; Juliet hearing his Voice, passion-ately upbraids him with not sending to Romeo; he justifies himself; descends into the Vault, and beholding Romeo extended almost lifeless on the Earth, breaks into an Exclamation of Sur-prize and Grief. Romeo then opening his Eyes for the last Time, recommends Juliet to

his Care, and asking Pardon of Heaven for his Offence, expires.
               The tender Expostulations of the Friar with Juliet after Romeo dies; her gloomy Silence; her fixed Despair; and lastly, her Death, oc-casioned by the Violence of her stifled Grief, are Circumstances truly tragical, and wrought up with all the Force of a poetic Imagi-nation.
               Had Shakespear ever seen the Italian Author, these striking Beauties would not have escaped him; and, if by copying the Translation only, he has given us a very affecting Tragedy, what might we not have expected, had he drawn his Hints from the beautiful Original.
               How little Shakespear owed to his own In-vention in his Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, may be seen by comparing that Play with the foregoing Novel: What Variations he has made, he was led into by copying from the French Translation, or perhaps from the En-glish one, in the Palace of Pleasure, which is literal from the French; and since it is pretty clear he did not understand the Italian, it is probable he took many more of his Plots from that Book, in which a great Number of the Italian Novels are translated; some from French Translations; as Romeo and Juliet, and others from the original Authors.
               There is not one Incident of Shakespear's Invention in his Play of Romeo and Juliet, ex-cept the Death of Paris by Romeo: This Character might have been very well spared in the Drama; his Appearance is of little Use, and his Death of still less, except to divert

our Compassion from the two principal Persons in the Play, whose Deaths make up the Ca-tastrophe of the Tragedy.
               
                  Paris seems only introduced to fall by the Hands of Romeo; and why must our Com-passion of the unfortunate Romeo be suspended by the undeserved Fate of Paris? What Ne-cessity is there for making Romeo, who is all along represented as an amiable and virtuous Character, imbrue his Hands in the Blood of an innocent Youth, (whose Death is of no Consequence) just before he expires?
               This Incident, however, is the only one of the Poet's Invention throughout the Play: The Fable and all the Characters, except Mer-cutio were formed to his Hands.
               Mr. Pope, in his Preface to his Edition of Shakespear's Plays, tells us, that "Shakespear's Characters are Nature herself; and that it is a Sort of Injury to call them by so distant a Name as Copies of her."
               It is certain, that all the Characters in Ro-meo, excepting, as I said before, Mercutio's, are exact Copies of those in the Novelist; and since he copied them from the Translator, and not the Original, in this Instance Mr. Pope's Observation of other Authors, may be applied to Shakespear, that "His Picture, like a mock Rainbow, is but a Reflexion of a Re-flexion."
            
            
               

               The seventh Novel of the third De-cad of the Hecatomythi of Giraldi Cinthio.
               
               
                  IN Venice there was a Moor, who for his extraordinary. Valour, and the many Proofs he had given of his consummate Pru-dence and superior Genius for War, was extremely dear to that Republic, which, more than any other, delighted in rewarding great and virtuous Ac-tions.
               A Venetian Lady of wonderful Beauty, named Disdemona, not subdued by the irregu-lar Sallies of a female Appetite, but struck with the great Qualities and noble Virtues of the Moor, became violently enamoured of him; and he, no less charmed with the Greatness of her Mind, than with the extreme Beauty of her Person, burnt in the most ardent Flames for her.
               Fortune so far favoured their mutual Pas-sion, that, notwithstanding the united Endea-vours

of all the Lady's Kindred to prevent it, they found Means to get their Marriage so-lemnized; and during their Abode in Venice they lived together in the greatest Harmony and Tranquility imaginable.
               It happened, that the Senate of Venice re-called their Forces which were at Cyprus, and gave the Command of those which were to be sent thither in their stead to the Moor.
               
               This Dignity was never conferred upon any but Persons of unquestionable Courage and Fidelity.
               The Moor therefore, considering this Com-mand as a Reward for that Valour he had shewn in the Service of the Republic, received it with great Joy; but when he reflected on the Length and Danger of the Voyage, the Necessity there seemed of leaving Disdemona behind him filled him with inconceivable Con-cern.
               
                  Disdemona, whose Felicity wholly centered in the Moor, was transported to find the Se-nate, by the public Dignity they bestowed on him, had given a Sanction to her Choice; and having resolved to accompany her Husband in so honourable an Expedition, waited for the Time of their Departure with the utmost Im-patience.
               The secret Grief which prey'd on the Heart of the Moor, beginning, as the Time of parting approached nearer, to spread a Gloom on his Countenance, and give an Air of Restraint to his Behaviour; Disdemona, ex-tremely alarmed, entreated him to tell her the Cause of that Change she observed in him:

"What is the Reason, said she, that I see you melancholy and dejected at a Time when the Honours you have received from the Senate give you most Reason to rejoice?"
               "The Excess of my Love for you, replied the Moor, sighing, prevents me from enjoying those Honours as I ought; since they force me to the sad Necessity of suffering one or other of two Things, both equally insupportable; for either I must expose you to the Dangers of the Sea, by taking you with me to Cyprus, or else leave you behind me at Venice: The first can-not but be a most heavy Misfortune to me, since every Fatigue you will suffer, every Danger you are exposed to, will bring me the extremest Affliction; and as for the second, parting with you is more terrible than parting with my Life."
               "Ah! my dearest Husband, said Disdemona, what Thoughts are these which you have suf-fered to afflict you? Did you imagine I would consent to a Separation from you? How could you wrong my Love so much? That Love, which, to be with you, would impel me to pass even through Flames; well may I then resolve to accompany you to Sea, in a secure and well mann'd Ship: If there are Dangers and Fatigues to be endured, you shall not en-dure them alone: I will share your Fortune whatever it be, and nothing but Death shall di-vide me from you."
               The Moor, in a Transport of grateful Tenderness, throwing his Arms round her Neck, and pressing her to his Bosom, cried out, "Heaven long preserve you, my most dear,

my lovely Wife, in these affectionate Senti-ments for me."
               Some little Time after, the necessary Pre-parations for their Voyage being ready, the Moor, with Disdemona and their Attendants, entered a Galley, and set sail for Cyprus; whi-ther, after, a pleasant and easy Voyage, they arrived, together with all the Forces under the Moor's Command.
               Among the Officers in these Troops was a Lieutenant, very dear to the Moor: Nature had given him a most beautiful and graceful Person, but a Mind replete with all Manner of Wickedness; however, he knew so well how to conceal his vicious Inclinations under an ap-parent generous and noble Behaviour, that his Hypocrisy, assisted by the Speciousness of his Form, procured him the Esteem and Friend-of all his Companions.
               The Moor, who had conceived a particular Friendship for him, took great Pleasure in his Conversation, and invited him frequently to his House, and Disdemona, fond of every Oc-casion of gratifying the Humour of her Hus-band, treated him with equal Civility.
               The Lieutenant had married a young Wo-man at Venice, whom he brought with him to Cyprus; Disdemona, fond of this Woman, because she was an Italian, and also an agree-able Companion, went often to her House, and passed great Part of the Day with her.
               The villainous Lieutenant having, by these Means, frequent Opportunities of seeing Dis-demona, became violently enamoured of her; and neither restrained by the Fidelity he owed

his Wife, or the Respect and Gratitude due to his Friend and Commander, resolved to use his utmost Endeavours to gratify his infamous Passion.
               Well knowing that Death would be the Consequence of his presumptuous Attempt if it came to the Knowledge of the Moor, he durst not discover his Flame to Disdemona any other Way than by Sighs and passionate Glances, hoping in Time to inspire her with Desires like his own.
               But the Lady, whose Thoughts were wholly engrossed by the Moor, took so little Notice of those silent Addresses, that her Indifference persuading him some other Lover possessed her Heart, Rage, Jealousy and Despair produced the Effects of the most violent Hatred, and he resolved to be revenged both on her and the Lover she favoured.
               A young Gentleman, who was Captain of a Troop at Cyprus, and greatly beloved by the Moor, was suspected by the Lieutenant to be the happy Rival who enjoyed the Affections of Disdemona; his Death therefore he deter-mined to procure; and by accusing the Lady to the Moor of Adultery, prevent any other from possessing her, since he could not.
               His Design thus laid, he waited only for some favourable Opportunity to put it in Exe-cution; the Moor's passionate Affection for his Wife, and the great Affection which subsisted between him and the young Captain, making the Villain apprehend his Enterprize would be very hazardous and doubtful.
               
                  
Fortune however assisted his wicked Inten-tions, and when he least expected it afforded him the Means of effecting them.
               The Captain happening indiscreetly to draw his Sword upon a Soldier and wounding him, the Moor was so much offended that he de-prived him of his Command.
               
                  Desdemona, who only regarded this young Gentleman because he was beloved of her Husband, was greatly concerned that he had fallen under his Displeasure, and often solici-ted for his Pardon.
               "I am so pressed, said the Moor one Day to the Lieutenant, with my Wife's Entreaties in Favour of the Captain, that I believe I must comply with her Desire, and pardon him."
               "She has Reason, said the Villain, seizing this Occasion to execute his Scheme, that she may see him as usual."
               "What is it you say?" replied the Moor hastily.
               "Do not insist upon my speaking plainer, resumed the Lieutenant: Far be it from me to sow the Seeds of Discord between Man and Wife; yet methinks if you would open your Eyes, some Things would not escape your Observation."
               The Moor, rouzed to Attention by these Words, and greatly disturbed at the latent Meaning of them, earnestly entreated the Lieutenant to explain himself more clearly; but the artful Villain absolutely refused; and though the Moor used his utmost Endeavours to persuade him to give him the Satisfaction he desired, yet he persisted in an obstinate De-nial:

Nevertheless, the Hints he had thrown out fixed a thousand Stings in the Breast of the wretched Husband; he ruminated Night and Day on the Purport of those fatal Words, and the more he reflected on them, the more his Disquiet encreased.
               
                  Disdemona, ignorant of the Cause of his Melancholy, did not neglect to solicit still for the Captain;â€”"Why, said she to him one Day, will you suffer a small Fault to cancel the Friendship which has subsisted so many Years between the Captain and you? Must all his Services and long-experienced Fidelity be wholly forgot for the Sake of one inconside-rate Action? The Soldier he wounded is no longer at Enmity with him; they are recon-ciled; and why should you continue inexo-rable?"
               The Moor, no longer able to suppress the Emotions with which his Heart had been long agitated, replied in a Rage.
               "It is strange, Disdemona, it is very strange, that you should be so extremely concerned about this Man; if he was your Brother, or some other Relation, his Interests could not be dearer to you."
               The Lady answered in a soft and humble Accent: "Heaven forbid, my Lord, that I should incur your Displeasure by soliciting for the Captain's Pardon, to which nothing has in-duced me but the Concern I am under to see you deprived of so good a Friend; a Friend whose Fidelity you have so often praised to me; the Fault he has committed is not great enough to merit your Hatred; but you Moors are by

Nature so furious, that every little Thing moves you to Anger, and a Desire of Revenge."
               "And that, answered the Moor (excessively enraged at her Words) ome Persons, who little think of it, shall prove; yes, they shall see me take a severe Vengeance for the Injuries I have suffered; and then, and not till then, shall I be satisfied."
               
                  Disdemona, full of Fear and Wonder at these ungentle Words, and unaccustomed Rage of her Husband, trembling and pale, re-plied, "Although my only Inducement to plead for the Captain was the Consideration of your Ease and Satisfaction, yet since my Solicitations are displeasing to you, I will ne-ver more speak to you on this Subject."
               To this humble and submissive Answer the Moor made no Reply; but comparing his Wife's earnest Entreaties for the Captain with the Lieutenant's Insinuations, a thousand black Suspicions rose in his Mind, tortured with Doubts of her Fidelity, and wishing, yet dreading, to be freed from his distracting Sus-pence.
               He quitted her with a gloomy Silence, and sending for the Lieutenant, renewed his En-treaties, that he would speak more openly con-cerning his Wife and the Captain.
               The Villain, who had resolved to effect the Ruin of these two Innocents, after long resist-ing the Moor's Solicitations, as if unwilling to give him Pain, feigning at last to be overcome by his repeated Prayers, said, "I cannot deny, my Lord, but that my extreme Reluctance to give you Uneasiness has prevented me thus

long from telling you what must afflict you more than any other; but since you command me to speak plain, the Regard I have for your Honour as my Friend, and the Duty I owe you as my General, will not permit me to disobey you: Know then, that your black Colour is become distasteful to your Wife; she is passionately in love with the Captain, and her Impatience at finding herself deprived of the Pleasure she took in his Company, is the Cause of her continual Solicitations for his Pardon, that she may converse with him as usual."
               These Words gave mortal Agonies to the Soul of the wretched Moor; and though he was but too well convinced of the Truth of them, yet, dissembling his Conviction in or-der to try him further, "I know not, said he, with a furious Countenance, why thou hast dared to load my Wife with these infamous Aspersions?"
               "This Rage, replied the Lieutenant, is the Reward I expected for my friendly Infor-mation; but since my Duty, and the Desire of preserving your Honour, has carried me this Length, I will not now go back: What I have told you is but too certain; and if your Wife, with a counterfeited Tenderness, has so blinded your Eyes, that you will not see your Dishonour, there is no Reason why I should not declare the Truth to you: The Captain himself has owned to me the Favours he has received from her; not satisfied with possessing her in Secret, he must have a Con-fident in his Happiness; but had I not been

afraid of your Resentment, I would that Mo-ment have rewarded his presumptuous Confes-sion with the Death he merited."
               The Moor, racked with unutterable Pangs, cried out, "Give me the Means of seeing with my own Eyes the Truth of what you have said, or else be sure I will make thee wish thou hadst been dumb."
               "It would have been easy to do this, re-plied the Villain, while the Captain and you continued in Friendship, and he had free Ac-cess to Disdemona; but now that you have punished him for a slight Fault, instead of taking Vengeance for an irreparable Injury, it will be difficult to satisfy you; but though I am persuaded that he enjoys Disdemona, whenever you give him an Opportunity, yet, it is cer-tain, since he is in Disgrace with you, he is obliged to act more cautiously than before, when, through your Friendship for him, he came to your House every Day; however, added he, taking Leave of him, I do not des-pair of being able soon to give you an Oppor-tunity of seeing what you will not believe without it."
               The unhappy Moor then returned to his House, carrying a poisoned Arrow in his Breast, and impatiently waited for the Day in which the Lieutenant was to prove the Truth of what he had told him, and confirm him in eternal Misery.
               Nor was the Villain himself wholly at ease, when reflecting on the known Chastity of Disdemona, he was sensible he could not give

the Moor such a convincing Proof of her Dis-loyalty as he demanded.
               After long deliberating with himself on the Methods by which he might best execute the horrid Scheme he had begun, he at last thought upon a Stratagem which seemed to promise Success.
               
                  Desdemona, as has been already said, went often to visit the Lieutenant's Wife; the Vil-lain, when she was one Day at his House, observed a Handkerchief at her Girdle, finely wrought in Moresco Work, which, because it was presented her by the Moor when he mar-ried her, she had a particular Value for it; it being also highly prized by the Moor himself: This Handkerchief the Lieutenant determined to steal, and with it accomplish her absolute Ruin.
               
                  Disdemona being extremely fond of a little Child of his, about three Years of Age, he took her in his Arms and carried her to the Lady, who receiving her from him, kissed her several Times, and pressed her close to her Breast.
               The Villain, in the mean while, drew her Handkerchief gently from her Girdle, and concealing it in his Pocket, went away trans-ported with Joy at his good Success.
               
                  Disdemona, wholly ignorant of her Loss, returned to her House, and did not miss her Handkerchief till some Time after, when hap-pening to have Occasion for it, and not being able, after diligent Search, to find it, she con-cluded it lost; and remained extremely terri-fied

lest the Moor should ask for it, as he often did.
               The Lieutenant, who had all this while been watching for an Opportunity to dispose of it where it might produce the Mischief he had projected, found Means at last to leave it on the Captain's Bed, whom he visited one Morning before he was up for that Purpose.
               The Captain rising soon after he went away, the Handkerchief fell upon the Floor, and he finding something under his Feet, stooped to take it up, and seeing the Handkerchief, knew it to be Disdemona's, but was not able to ima-gine how it came there; resolving however to return it to her, he put it in his Pocket, and going out, was informed that the Moor was not at home; taking this Opportunity therefore to deliver it, he went to a back Door, and knocked softly; Fortune, as it should seem, conspiring with the cruel Lieutenant to ruin the innocent Disdemona, brought the Moor back just in that Moment, who, hearing some-body knock in that cautious Manner, full of tormenting Distrust, he ran to a Window, and opening it, enquired in a surly Accent, who was there?
               The Captain, hearing the Moor's Voice, and fearing that he intended to do him a Mis-chief, ran away without speaking a Word.
               The Moor ran eagerly down Stairs, and rushed into the Street to seek him, but he was already out of Sight; then returning full of Rage and Grief, he went to his Wife's Apart-ment, and asked her if she knew who it was that had knocked below?
               
                  
The Lady replied, "that she could not tell who it was;" which indeed was true.
               "I think, said the Moor, it seemed to be the Captain."
               "I know not, replied Disdemona, whether it was him or any other."
               The Moor supposing she did not answer him truly, with Difficulty restrained his Rage from breaking into Reproaches and Menaces; but resolving to act nothing against her till he had consulted his wicked Confidant; and to prevent her discovering his Disorder, left her suddenly, and went to the Lieutenant, to whom he related what had happened, en-treating him to go to the Captain and endea-vour to make some more Discoveries.
               The Villain, secretly exulting at this Acci-dent, promised him to do as he required; and placing the Moor, where unseen himself, he might see them together, though not hear their Discourse, he artfully contrived to bring the Captain near the Place, and began to talk with him on indifferent Things, using at the same Time such Gestures with his Head and Hands, as persuaded the Moor they were talk-ing about Disdemona, and making a Jest of his Dishonour and her Incontinence.
               When they parted, the Moor eagerly quitted his Concealment, and came to the Lieutenant to know what they had been saying.
               The subtle Villain, suffering himself to be long entreated before he would discover what he had heard, at length confessed, that the Captain told him, "he had often enjoyed Dis-demona, when, by his being abroad, they had

an Opportunity to meet; and added, that the Captain had told him also, that the last Time he was with Disdemona, she gave him that Handkerchief which he had presented her the Day of their Marriage."
               The Moor thanked the Lieutenant for this Intelligence, and told him, "that he would ask Disdemona for that Handkerchief, and if she could not produce it, he should be con-vinced all that he had told him concerning her Infidelity was true."
               Accordingly, one Day after Dinner, dis-coursing freely with Disdemona on indifferent Things, he took Occasion to speak of the Handkerchief, and asked to see it.
               The Lady, who had long dreaded this De-mand, blushed excessively, and thinking to conceal her Confusion, which was well ob-served by the Moor, rose and pretended to seek for it; and after she had employed herself in this Manner some time, "I cannot find it, said she (returning to her Husband) perhaps you have it yourself."
               "Is it probable, replied he, that I would desire you to give it me if I had it in my Pos-session; however, look for it no more at pre-sent; you will find it perhaps some other Time."
               Then leaving the Room, he began to con-sider in what Manner he should murder his Wife and the Captain without bringing on himself the Suspicion of being the Author of their Deaths.

his Behaviour to her much altered, often en-deavoured to discover the Cause.
               "What ails you, my Lord, said she to him many Times? Why do I behold you always disturbed and uneasy? You who used to be the gayest Man in the World, are now become the most peevish and melancholy."
               The Moor, continuing to dissemble his Re-sentment, returned her evasive Answers, with which she was but ill satisfied; conscious she had given him no Cause for treating her un-kindly, she concluded Possession had abated his Flame, and Disgust had succeeded to his once violent Passion for her; full of these me-lancholy Apprehensions, she went to the Lieu-tenant's House, in order to unburthen her Heart to his Wife, with whom she lived in great Familiarity.
               "Alas! said she, weeping, as soon as she saw her, I know not what to think of my Lord; he, who was once all Love and Ten-derness towards me, is become so altered with-in these few Days, that I am persuaded he no longer loves me; and I fear I shall prove a sad Example to all young Ladies who presume to marry against the Consents of their Parents; and a Warning to the Italian Women never to join themselves to Men, between whom and them Nature and Heaven have placed such wide Distinctions.â€”I know, added she, sigh-ing, that my Lord is fond of your Husband, and communicates to him all his Affairs; if through him then you are acquainted with the Cause of the Moor's unaccustomed Cold-ness

to me, I entreat you to let me know it, and do not refuse me your Assistance in this Di-stress?"
               The Lieutenant's Wife was indeed well ac-quainted with the whole Affair; her Husband having often pressed her to join with him in his cruel Schemes against the innocent Disde-mona; but though she never would consent to the being accessary to her Ruin, yet, dreading her Husband's Resentment if she betrayed his Secret, she only replied, "I advise you, Madam, to beware of giving the General any Suspicions of your Fidelity, and let it be your continual Study to persuade him of your Truth and Affection."
               "All this I do, replied the weeping Dis-demona, but all is in vain."
               In the mean time the Moor, restless, unre-solved, and seeking Occasion to be convinced of what he wished not to know, entreated the Lieutenant to contrive it so, that he might see Disdemona's Handkerchief in the Captain's Hands.
               This, although the Villain thought very dif-ficult, yet he promised to perform, and watched all Opportunities of keeping his Word.
               The Captain had a Woman in the House who was very skilful in Works of Embroi-dery; she having seen Disdemona's Handker-chief, and understanding that it was to be re-turned to her, resolved to work one like it.
               The Lieutenant being informed of this, and one Day knowing that Woman was seated at a Window working, with the fatal Hand-kerchief before her for a Pattern, he carried the

                  Moor through the Street, who perceiving his Wife's Handkerchief in that Woman's Pos-session, had no longer any Doubt of her Infi-delity, and took a firm Resolution to murder her and the no less injured Captain.
               Conferring therefore with the Lieutenant upon the Means of executing his horrid Pur-pose, he earnestly entreated him to undertake to murder the Captain, assuring him that he would never forget the Obligation.
               The Lieutenant excusing himself from complying, as well for the Wickedness of the Deed, as for the great Danger in attempting it, the Captain being a very brave and coura-gious Man; the Moor added to his Entreaties the Present of a large Sum of Money, which at last fixed him in a Resolution to obey him.
               The Lieutenant had not waited long for an Opportunity of executing his impious Design, before Fortune presented him with a very fa-vourable one.
               The Captain coming late one Night out of the House of a Courtezan, whom he kept, the Lieutenant, who was watching for him, rushed suddenly, and with one Stroke of a Scymetar cut off his Leg.
               The unhappy Captain fell to the Ground, and the Lieutenant upon him, who sought to finish the Murder; wounded as he was, however, he drew his Sword, and endeavoured to defend himself, crying out aloud for Help.
               Some Soldiers who were quartered near the Place, came running to his Assistance; so that the Lieutenant, fearing to be discovered, left him and ran away; yet he did not go far, but

taking a little Compass, joined some other Persons, who, drawn by the Captain's Cries, were hastening to him, and mixing among the Crowd who were about him, he saw that his Leg was cut off, and did not doubt but he would die of the Wound; nevertheless, con-cealing his inward Joy at his Success, under an Appearance of great Concern for the Cap-tain's Misfortune, he lamented it as if it had happened to his Brother.
               In the Morning the News of this Accident was spread all over the City, and coming to the Knowledge of Disdemona, she, who was naturally tender and compassionate, expressed great Sorrow for it.
               The Moor, distracted with Rage at this Confirmation (as he thought it) of her Af-fection for the Captain, went hastily to his wicked Confidant:â€”"Dost thou know, said he, trembling with Fury, that my Wife is in such Grief for the Captain's Misfortune, that she is almost distracted?"
               "How can it be otherwise, replied the Lieu-tenant, when he is her Soul."
               "Her Soul, repeated the furious Moor, Ah I will tear her Soul from her Body!â€”I should be unworthy the Name of a Man if I suffered such a Wretch to live."
               Then consulting together how they should dispatch her, whether by Poison, or a Dag-ger, the Lieutenant pausing, said, "I have thought of a Method by which you may kill her, without giving Suspicion to any one that you had any Hand in her Death, and this it is: The House in which you live is very old,

and the Cieling of your Chamber has many Cracks in it; 'tis my Advice that we should beat Disdemona with a Bag of Sand till she dies, that no Mark of Violence may appear on her Body; when she is dead we will throw down Part of a rotten Beam from the Cieling, and having broke her Scull, pretend she was killed by the Fall of the Beam as she lay in Bed.
               This cruel Contrivance pleased the Moor extremely, and having agreed to execute it the following Night, he found Means se-cretly to convey the Lieutenant into a Closet within the Bed-Chamber.
               The unhappy Disdemona retired at her usual Hour to Bed, and the Moor with her; they had not lain long before the Lieutenant mak-ing some little rustling in the Closet, the Moor asked his Wife if she heard any Noise?
               She answering in the affirmative, rise then, said the Moor, and see what it is?
               The Lady got up immediately, and the Lieu-tenant that Moment rushing out of the Closet, gave her a furious Blow with a Bag of Sand on her Back; the wretched Disdemona fell on the Floor almost breathless, yet faintly calling her Hus-band to help her, he throwing himself out of the Bed, replied, infamous Woman, thou now receivest the Reward of thy Unchastity, thus ought all Adulteresses to be treated, who deluding their Husbands with a feigned Affec-tion, load them with Shame and Grief.
               The wretched Lady hearing these Words, and feeling herself near her End, by another Blow which the cruel Lieutenant had given

her, sighed out with a broken and interrupted Voiceâ€”Since Justice has been denied me in this World, Oh, let the Divine Justice bear Witness to my Innocence, and receive my Soul to Mercy.
               The remorseless Villain, unmoved with this pathetic Exclamation, striking her a third Time with all his Force, she expired immediately.
               When they were convinced she was dead, the Lieutenant took her off the Floor, and crashing her Scull laid her in the Bed, then with the Moor's Assistance, broke down Part of a Beam, and placed it so as to give it an Ap-pearance of having fallen upon her Head.
               The Lieutenant then went cautiously out of the House; and the Moor with loud Cries, began to call for Help, saying the House was tum-bling down; the Servants and Neighbours ran in to his Assistance, and some of them ap-proaching the Bed, found Disdemona within it dead, and, as they supposed, murdered by the Fall of the Beam.
               This piteous Spectacle drew Tears and Complaints from all who beheld it, and the next Day the Corpse of the injured Lady was buried, amidst the universal Grief of all the Inhabitants of Cyprus, to whom her Virtues had rendered her extremely dear.
               The Manner of her Death not being suspect-ed by any one, the villainous Perpetrators of it thought themselves absolutely secure, but the Almighty Justice would not long permit such a Crime to remain unpunished.
               
                  
The Moor, who had loved the unhappy Lady with the utmost Excess of Passion, find-ing himself deprived of her for ever, and not able to endure the Loss, his whole Soul was filled with the most torturing Anguish, and in the Frenzy of his Grief, he would search for her in every Apartment of the House, and call incessantly on her Name; then reflecting, that by the Lieutenant's Accusations he had lost this beloved Wife for ever, and with her all the Comfort and Happiness of his Life, he conceived so violent a Hatred of him, that he could not endure to have him in his Sight, and had he not feared the inviolable Justice of the Venetian Senate, he would have put him to Death; but not being able to do this, without hazarding his own Life, that he might in some Measure gratify his Revenge, he deprived him of his Post.
               The Lieutenant enraged as this Treat-ment, resolved to effect his Ruin; and for that Purpose went to the Captain, who was now recovered, but with the Loss of his Leg, having been obliged to have a wooden one in its stead "The Time is now come, said the diabolical Villain, in which you may take Vengeance on the Man who was the Occasi-on of the Loss of your Leg; if you will go with me to Venice, I will there discover him to you and the Senate, and prove the Truth of what I now say; but here, for many Rea-sons, I dare not speak plainer."
               The Captain, who wished for nothing so much as to be revenged on this secret Enemy, thanked the Lieutenant for his Information,

and a few Days after they both embarked for Venice.
               
               When they arrived, the Lieutenant told him that it was the Moor who had cut off his Leg, through an Opinion that he had dis-honoured his Wife, and that for the same Cause he had also murdered her, and made it be reported that she was killed by the Fall of a Beam.
               The Captain hereupon accused the Moor to the Venetian Senate, of having deprived him of his Leg, and murdering his Lady, producing the Lieutenant for a Witness to both these Facts.
               The Lieutenant then related the Manner in which it had been executed, adding, that the Moor had communicated this whole Scheme to him, and offered him great Rewards to assist him in it, which because of the Wickedness of the Deeds, he had absolutely refused.
               The Senate, enraged at the Cruelty which had been practised by a Barbarian upon two of their Citizens, sent Orders to have the Moor arrested at Cyprus, and brought with a strong Guard to Venice.
               
               Soon after his Arrival he was publicly tried, but persisting in a Denial of the Crimes with which he was accused, he was put to the Tor-ture, but such was his extream Obstinacy and Contempt of Pain, that all the different Torments which were inflicted on him, were not able to force a Confession from his Lips.
               He was therefore sent back to Prison, and some Time after banished from Venice for ever, but though he had escaped Death by the

Law, yet the Relations of Disdemona procured him to be murdered in the Place to which he had retired.
               The Lieutenant returned to his own Coun-try, and continuing still in his wicked Practi-ces, he accused one of his Companions of having offered him a Reward to kill his Ene-my; the Gentleman was seized and racked, but he denied the Fact so resolutely, and spoke so much against his wicked Accuser, that he also was put to the same Torture, so that being miserably mangled, he died as they were taking him down from the Rack, to carry him to his own House.
               The Lieutenant's Wife, after her Husband's Death, returning to Venice, related all the foregoing Particulars to the Senate. And thus by the especial Providence of God was the Death of the innocent Disdemona revenged.
            
            
               

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of Othello, or the Moor of Venice.
               
               
                  OTHELLO, or the Moor of Venice, the Plot of which is drawn from the foregoing Novel of Giraldi Cinthio, has always been esteemed one of the best of Shakespear's Tra-gedies.
               'Tis confessed the Fable is more regular, the Incidents less numerous and closer connect-ed, and the Subject more of a Piece than any other of his Plays, except Romeo and Juliet.
               
               The Fable Shakespear found already form-ed to his Hands, some few Alterations he has made in it, and generally for the better.
               Thus it stands in the Poet.
               
                  Othello, a Moor descended of Royal Blood, eminent for his great Valour, and the Services he had done the Venetians in their Wars, is preferred by the Senate to the Government of the Island of Cyprus, which was threatned with an Invasion by the Turks.

               The fifth Novel of the eighth Decad of the Hecatomythi of Giraldi Cinthio.
               
               
                  THE Roman Empire was at the Heighth of it's Grandeur and Power, when Maximine, a great and virtuous Prince, reigned over it; this Emperor, who desired no-thing more ardently, than the Welfare and Hap-piness of all his Subjects, was extremely nice in the Choice of those Persons whom he deputed to govern the Provinces dependant on the Em-pire, assigning those Employments only to Men whose Integrity and Virtue were well known to him.
               

of Venice, who had married him unknown to her Father.
               
                  Iago, Ancient to Othello, being jealous that the Moor had had an Intrigue with his Wife, and desirous of procuring the Post of Lieutenant for himself, which was possessed by Cassio, a young Officer very dear to the Moor, to gratify his Revenge and Ambition at once, he entertains a Design of making Othello jealous of Desdemona and Cassio, so to bring a-bout her Death, and the Removal of Cassio.
               
               To effect this, by various Arts he raises Suspicions in the Mind of Othello, and to con-firm them prevails on his Wife, who attend-ed Desdemona, to steal a Handerchief which the Moor had given her.
               This Handkerchief he drops in Cassio's Apartment, and Othello accidentally seeing it in his Hand, is convinced of his Wife's In-fidelity, orders Iago to kill his Rival, promising to make him his Lieutenant in his stead, and himself smothers Desdemona in her Bed.
               
                  Cassio escapes only with a slight Wound.
               
                  Emilia, the Wife of Iago, finding her Mis-tress murdered, and hearing Othello declare he had killed her through her Husband's In-formations that she had wronged him with Cassio, in whose Possession he had seen the Handkerchief he had given her; she con-fesses she had stolen the Handkerchief at her Husband's Request.
               
                  Iago, finding himself discovered, stabs his Wife, and in Part confesses his Villany.
               
                  Othello, in Despair, falls upon his Sword and dies, and the Punishment of Iago is left to

                  Cassio, who before Othello's Death was or-dered by the Senate to take upon him the Go-vernment of Cyprus.
               
               In Cinthio the Moor is mentioned without any Mark of Distinction; Shakespear makes him descended from a Race of Kings, his Person is therefore made more considerable in the Play than in the Novel, and the Dignity which the Venetian Senate bestows upon him is less to be wondered at.
               In the Play, Cassio, the Person of whom Othello is jealous, is represented to be a young amiable Officer, remarkable for the Agreeable-ness of his Person, and the Sweetness of his Manners, and therefore likely enough to in-spire Desdemona with a Passion for him.
               In the Novel, these Qualities are all ascrib-ed to the Villain who betrays the Moor to the Murder of his Wife; and the suspected Rival is no more than an ordinary Person.
               
                  Cinthio might perhaps think it necessary to give his Villain a pleasing Person and insinuat-ing Address, in order to make his Artifices less suspected; but to give Probability to the Jea-lousy of the Moor, was it not also as neces-sary to make the suspected Rival possess some of those Qualities with which the Minds of young Ladies are soonest captivated.
               
                  Shakespear therefore paints Cassio young, handsome, and brave; and Othello, who feeds his Jealousy, by reflecting that he himself is neither young nor handsome, by the same Train of Thought falls naturally into a Sus-picion, that what he loses, for want of those

Qualities, will be gained by another who pos-sesses them.
               But on the other Hand Shakespear has made a very ill Use of the Lieutenant's Wife.
               
                  Cinthio shews this Woman privy, much a-against her Will, to the Design on Dis-demona; and though she dares not discover it to her, for fear of her Husband's Resentment, yet she endeavours to put her upon her Guard, and gives her such Advice, as she thinks will render all his Schemes ineffectual.
               
                  Shakespear calls this Woman Emilia, and makes her the Attendant and Friend of Desdemona, yet shews her stealing a Hand-kerchief from her, which she gives to her Husband, telling him at the same Time that the Lady will run mad when she misses it; therefore, if it is not for some Purpose of Im-portance that he wants it, desires him to re-turn it to her again.
               If her Husband wants it for any Purpose of Importance, that Purpose cannot be very good; this Suspicion however never enters her Mind, but she gives it him only upon that very Condition, which ought to have made her refuse it.
               Yet this Woman is the first who perceives Othello to be jealous, and repeats this Obser-vation to her Mistress, upon hearing him so often demand the Handkerchief she had stolen, and fly into a Rage when he finds his Wife cannot produce it.
               
                  Emilia pronounces him jealous, perceives the Loss of that fatal Handkerchief, confirms some Suspicions he had entertained, and though

she loves her Mistress to Excess, chuses rather to let her suffer all the bad Consequences of his Jealousy, than confess she had taken the Handkerchief, which might have set all right again; and yet this same Woman, who could act so base and cruel a Part against her Mis-tress, has no greater Care in dying, than to be laid by her Side.
               Mr. Rymer, in his Criticisims on this Play, severely censures the Characters as well as the Fable, and Conduct of the Incidents.
               That of Emilia though more inconsistent than any, he has taken no Notice of; and most of the Charges he brings against the others have little or no Foundation.
               The Character of Iago, says this Critic, is against common Sense and Nature. 
                     Shake-spear would pass upon us a close, dissem-bling, false, insinuating Rascal, instead of an open-hearted, frank plain dealing Sol-dier; a Character constantly worn by them for some Thousands of Years in the World.
               
               The Soldiers are indeed greatly obliged to Mr. Rymer for this Assertion, but though it may in general be true, yet surely it is not absurd to suppose that some few Individuals amongst them may be close dissembling Villains.
               
                  Iago was a Soldier, it is true, but he was also an Italian; he was born in a Country remark-able for the deep Art, Cruelty, and revengeful Temper of its Inhabitants. To have painted an Italian injured, or under a Suspicion of be-ing injured, and not to have shewn him re-vengeful,

would have been mistaking his Cha-racter.
               It is with Justice indeed that Mr. Rymer condemns Shakespear for that unnecessary and diabolical Cruelty he makes Iago guilty of in urging Othello to the Murder of the innocent Lady who had never offended him; his Point was gained by making Othello jealous, and procuring his Consent to the Death of Cassio, who stood in his Way to Preferment: But the Murder of Desdemona was such an Excess of wanton Cruelty, that one can hardly con-ceive it possible a Man could be so transcend-ently wicked.
               
                  Cinthio indeed makes Iago not only urge Othello to the Murder of his Wife, but is him-self the Perpetrator of it; this seems still more absurd; but he tells us, that he had been vio-lently in love with Disdemona, and the Indif-ference she had discovered towards him con-verted his Love into a settled Hatred.
               
                  Shakespear injudiciously copies Cinthio in making Iago confess a Passion for Desdemona, as it rendered his urging on her Murder less probable; since in the Play Iago had no Op-portunity of declaring that Love to her, and consequently could not be stimulated by her Contempt of him to act so cruel a Part against her.
               But he has greatly improved on the Novel-ist by making him jealous of the Moor with his own Wife; this Circumstance being suf-ficient, in an Italian especially, to account for the Revenge he takes on Othello, though his Barbarity to Desdemona is still unnatural.
               
                  
Upon the whole, there is very little Difference between the Character of the Lieutenant as it is drawn in the Novel, and Iago as managed in the Play; his ambiguous Questions, dark Hints, and villainous Arts to raise Suspicions in the Mind of Othello are the same in the No-vel as in the Play; and the Scene where Othello is made to observe the Gestures of Cassio while he is talking to Iago, is exactly copied from Cinthio; as is likewise a preceding one, where Othello, tormented with Doubts about his Wife, threatens Iago with Destruction, unless he gives him ocular Proof of her Dis-honesty.
               This Demand, with Iago's Expostulations, Arguments, and satisfactory Replies, are also the same with those in the Novel.
               The Character of Desdemona fares no bet-ter in Mr. Rymer's Hands, than that of Iago; her Love for the Moor, he says, is out of Na-ture.
               Such Affections are not very common in-deed; but a very few Instances of them prove that they are not impossible; and even in Eng-land we see some very handsome Women married to Blacks, where their Colour is le
                     â€¢
                  s familiar than at Venice; besides the Italian La-dies are remarkable for such Sallies of irre-gular Passions.
               
                  Cinthio, it is true, says, that Disdemona was not overcome by a womanish Appetite, but represents her, as Shakespear does likewise, subdued by the great Qualities of the Moor.
               Courage in Men has always had an invin-cible Charm for the Ladies; Desdemona ad-mired

the Moor for his Valour, and the Tran-sition from extreme Admiration to Love is very easy in a female Mind.
               Mr. Rymer alledges, that Shakespear makes Desdemona a Senator's Daughter instead of a simple Citizen; and this he imputes to him as a Fault, which is perhaps a great Instance of his Judgment.
               There is less Improbability in supposing a noble Lady, educated in Sentiments superior to the Vulgar, should fall in love with a Man merely for the Qualities of his Mind, than that a mean Citizen should be possessed of such exalted Ideas, as to overlook the Disparity of Years and Complexion, and be enamoured of Virtue in the Person of a Moor.
               However, it is not true, that Shakespear has changed a simple Citizen into a Lady of Qua-lity, since Desdemona in the Novel is men-tioned as a Woman of high Birth.
               
                  Cinthio calls her Cittadina, which Mr. Ry-mer translates a simple Citizen; but the Ita-lians by that Phrase mean a Woman of Quality.
               If they were, for Example, to speak of a Woman of the middle Rank in Rome, they would say, Una Romana; if of a noble Lady, Una Cittadina Romana: So in Venice they call a simple Citizen Una Venitiana; but a Woman of Quality, Una Cittadina Veritiana.
               
               That Simplicity in the Manners of Desde-mona, which Mr. Rymer calls Folly and Mean-ness of Spirit, is the Characteristic of Virtue and Innocence.
               
                  

                  Desdemona was conscious of no Guilt, and therefore suspected no Blame: She had so late-ly given the Moor an incontestable Proof of her Affection, that it was not unnatural for her to impute his sudden Starts of Passion to some other Cause than Jealousy.
               The whole Stress of the Proof against Des-demona is laid upon the Handkerchief, as well in the Novel as the Play; though I think in the Novel it is more artfully managed; there the Moor insists upon seeing it in the Captain's Possession e'er he will resolve any Thing against his Wife, and the Lieutenant contrives to give him this Satisfaction.
               
                  Othello, in the Play, has not the least Ap-pearance of Proof against his Wife, but see-ing the Handkerchief in the Lieutenant's Pos-session; yet this is brought about by mere Ac-cident.
               
                  Bianca, to whom Cassio had given it to have the Work copied, (which, by the way, was an odd Whim for a Soldier) comes to him while he is engaged in a private Discourse with Iago; and Othello observing them concealed, and in a Fit of Jealousy, throws the Handker-chief at his Head.
               This happens well for Iago's Plot; but as he did not, and indeed could not foresee, this lucky Accident, methinks it would have been more natural, since every Thing depended upon that, to have made it the Effect of some Contrivance of his.
               The Outlines Iago, Desdemona, and Cassio's Characters are taken from the Novel; but that of Othello is entirely the Poet's own.
               
                  
In Cinthio we have a Moor, valiant indeed, as we are told, but suspicious, sullen, cunning, obstinate and cruel.
               Such a Character married to the fair Desde-mona must have given Disgust on the Stage; the Audience would have been his Enemies, and Desdemona herself would have sunk into Contempt for chusing him.
               With what Judgment then has Shakespear changed the horrid Moor of Cinthio into the amiable Othello, and made the same Actions which we detest in one, excite our Compas-sion in the other!
               The Virtues of Shakespear's Moor are no less characteristic than the Vices of Cinthio's; they are the wild Growth of an uncultivated Mind, barbarous and rude as the Clime he is born in; thus, his Love is almost Phrensy; his Friendship Simplicity; his Justice cruel; and his Remorse Self-Murder.

                  SOME Italian Merchants meet-ing at Paris, whither their dif-ferent Affairs had brought them, they went, as was their Custom, to sup together at a Tavern; and, towards the Close of the Entertainment, their Spirits being raised by the Wine, of which they drank pretty freely, they began, after having discussed several other Subjects, to speak of their Wives, whom they had left behind them in their Houses; and one of them, laughing, said:
               "I know not how my Wife employs herself in my Absence, but this I am certain of; that when I am at a Distance from her, I freely in-dulge myself in the Pursuit of any young Girl that pleases me, and never fail to make myself Master of her Person, if I possibly can."
               Another replied, "that he did the same; because, added he, whether I believe my Wife unfaithful, or not, she will be so if she pleases."

A Third assured his Companions "that he was of the same Opinion;" and, in fine, they all agreed in declaring, "that they believed their Wives would not lose Time in their Absence;" except a Genoese Merchant, named Bernabo Lomillin.
               
               This young Man, who was passionately fond of his Wife, affirmed, "that by the especial Providence of God he had married a Woman so accomplished in all Virtues, that Italy could scarce produce her Equal."
               "Her Person, said he, is perfectly beauti-ful; she is in the Prime of her Youth; and is not only skilled in all domestic Employments fit for a Person of her Rank, but she reads, writes, and discourses upon Business, as well as if she was a Merchant; she is also wise, prudent and amiable; and so absolutely chaste, that I am persuaded, if I was to be absent from her ten Years, she would preserve her Fidelity to me inviolable."
               This last Praise extremely diverted a young Merchant of Piacenza, named Ambrogiuolo, who, laughing, asked Bernabo "if he possessed this Privilege above other Men by a Patent from the Emperor.
               "This Happiness, replied Bernabo, a little offended, is not granted by the Emperor, but by God, whom I look upon to be little more powerful than the Emperor."
               "I do not in the least doubt, replied Ambro-giuolo, but that you believe what you say; but you have too little considered the Nature of

Things, otherwise you would not be so grossly deceived, but would speak less assuredly upon this Matter; do you imagine that we, who have delivered our Sentiments thus freely of our Wives, believe we have married Women, whose Dispositions are different from yours? no, we hold all Women to be alike; and the Judgment we have formed of them arises from our having well reflected on their Na-tures; let us then examine this Matter a lit-tle."
               I have always understood Man to be the noblest Animal of God's Creation; and that the Woman holds the next Place; if Man therefore, as he is generally believed, and proves by his Faculties, is the nearest to Per-fection, he must certainly be endowed with more Firmness and Constancy than the Wo-man, who is universally allowed to be a fickle and variable Creature; yet since Man, with all his Firmness and Constancy cannot resist those Desires which make him seek the Pos-session of any one that pleases him, how canst thou hope that a Woman, changeable and un-fixed by Nature, should be able to resist the Force of Intreaties, Praises, Gifts, and a Thousand other Temptations, with which Men who know the Sex, endeavour to ensnare them?"
               "Can you then, reflecting upon this Truth, believe your Wife faithful?"
               "I confess, though you should tell me you do, I could not believe you."
               "Is not your Wife a Woman, has she not Flesh and Blood as other Women have?

are not the same Desires given to her as to others, and the same Ability to resist them? 'tis therefore possible, although she be very virtuous, that she may do as others do; and you ought not so positively to affirm the con-trary."
               To this long Speech Barnabo replied:
               "I am a Merchant, and not a Philosopher, therefore will not pretend to reason with you; but this I must say, that those Women who are unchaste, are so, because they have no Sense of Shame, and are indifferent about the World's Opinion; but Women who are wise and virtuous, are so sollicitous to preserve their Honour, that they become stronger than Men, who take no Care to restrain their irre-gular Appetites; and my Wife is of the Num-ber of those Women who are watchful over their Appetites, and sollicitous to preserve their Honour."
               "Truly, replied Ambrogiuolo, if every Time a Woman was unfaithful to her Husband, a Horn should grow out of her Forehead, and bear Witness to the Fact, I believe few Wo-men would be guilty of Infidelity; but the Horn neither grows, nor in Women who manage their Intrigues wisely, does there re-main the least Trace of their Crime; for their Shame does not consist in their Infidelity, but in that Infidelity being discovered; there-fore when they can be unchaste securely, they are so, and when they are not unchaste, 'tis because they are stupid; and be assured there-fore,

that she only is chaste who was never sollicited, or being sollicited never yielded."
               "And although I am convinced of this Truth, by considering in general the Frailty of Human Nature, yet I would not speak so positively as I do, if I had not many Times, and with many different Women, proved it beyond Contradiction; and I am also persuad-ed, that if I was near thy supremely virtuous Wife, I should in a very short Space of Time bring her to that, to which I have brought many others."
               "It Signifies nothing disputing, replied Barnabo, (greatly disturbed) Words prove nothing at all; but since you say that no Wo-man is able to resist Sollicitations, and are so confident of your own Power with the Sex, that you are absolutely certain you can corrupt my Wife, I am willing to lose my Head if you succeed in your Attempts upon her Chastity, and if you do not, you shall lose a Thousand Florins of Gold to me."
               "I know not, returned Ambrogiuolo, al-ready fired at his Proposition, what I should do with your Head if you lost it to me, but if you are willing to have a Proof of what I have maintained, do you lay five Thousand Florins of Gold (which ought to be less dear to you than your Head) against a Thousand of mine, and I will oblige myself to go to Genoa, and in three Months from the Day I depart from hence, will prevail upon thy Wife to yield to my Desires, and, in Token of my

Success, will bring with me some of her most precious Things, and give you such certain Marks, that you yourself shall confess I have accomplished my Design."
               "But you must promise me faithfully that you will not come to Genoa during my Stay there, nor write any Account of this Matter to your Wife."
               
                  Bernabo was extremely pleased with this Proposal, but the other Merchants, who were present, fearing some bad Consequence would arise from such a strange Scheme, were very much troubled, and endeavoured to prevent its being put into Execution.
               However, the two Persons concerned were so resolutely bent on their Purpose, that all Dissuasions were ineffectual; and an Obliga-tion in Writing being drawn up, they both signed and sealed it in the Presence of their Companions; and a few Days after Ambrogiuolo went to Genoa; Bernabo, according to his Promise, staying at Paris to expect his Re-turn.
               As soon as Ambrogiuolo arrived at Genoa, he began secretly to enquire after the Behaviour and Manner of Life of Bernabo's Wife, and comparing the Reports of others, with what Bernabo had told him concerning her, he found the Merchant had not been too lavish in her Praises; and his Enterprize now ap-pearing even to himself rash and impractica-ble, he was beginning to lose all Hopes of being able to accomplish it, when Chance

threw in his Way a poor Woman, who was often employed in the House of Madonna Zinevra, so was the Wife of Bernabo called.
               
                  Ambrogiuolo corrupting this Woman with a Sum of Money, engaged her to assist him in his Design on the Lady.
               Giving Orders therefore for a Chest to be made after a particular Manner, he laid him-self into it, and the old Woman pretending she had some Business to transact a few Miles out of the Town, which would oblige her to stay a Day or two away, intreated Madonna Zinevra, who had a great Kindness for her, to let this Chest stand in her Bed-Chamber till she returned, the Lady consented, and the Chest, with Ambrogiuolo within it, was placed where she desired.
               
                  Zinevra retiring to Rest at her usual Hour, Ambrogiuolo, when he was assured that she was asleep, came softly out of the Chest into the Chamber, and, by the Light of a Taper which was burning, took particular Notice of the Pictures and Furniture of the Room.
               Then advancing to the Bed, where the Lady and a little Girl that was with her slept very soundly, he gently uncovered her, and saw that she was no less beautiful naked than drest, and as he was thus contemplating her, and wishing to discover some particular Mark about her Person, which might help him to deceive her Husband, he at last spied a large Mole under her left Breast, with several Hairs round it of the Colour of Gold.
               
                  
Satisfied with this Discovery, he replaced the Cloaths, but her Beauty inflaming his De-sires, he was some Moments in Suspence whether he should not wake her, and declare the Cause of his coming thither, to be his Love of her.
               Reflecting however upon the Severity of her Virtue; he resolved not to hazard his Life by discovering himself, but passed the rest of the Night at his Ease in the Chamber.
               Day approaching he retired into the Chest, taking with him a Purse, a Ring, and some other Trifles.
               In this Confinement he passed another Night, and the Day following the Woman coming for her Chest, he was released; and hav-ing thus traiterously accomplished his Intenti-ons, he left Genoa, and arrived at Paris before the Time prefixed for his Return.
               
                  Bernabo and the Merchants who were pre-sent at the Wager, were summoned by Am-brogiuolo, and when they were all met, he de-clared he had won the Wager, for that the Wife of Bernabo had yielded to his Desires, producing as a Proof of what he said, the Things which he had taken away, saying they were given him by the Lady; the Furni-ture of whose Bed-Chamber he also described.
               
                  Bernabo confessed that his Description of the Bed-Chamber was right, and also that the Things he produced were certainly his Wife's, but added, that neither of these Circumstances were any Proof of his Wife's Infidelity, since

he might by some Stratagem have procured the Knowledge of the one, and the Possession of the other, and therefore if he had no other Proofs, these were insufficient to make him give up the Wager.
               "These Prooofs, replied Ambrogiuolo, ought to be sufficient, but since you will oblige me to produce more, I will."
               
                  "Madonna Zinevra, your Wife, has a large Mole under her left Breast, round which there are two or three Hairs of the Colour of Gold."
               
                  Bernabo struck to the Heart by these Words, made known by the Change of his Colour, and the Rage and Grief which took Possession of his Features, that what Ambrogiuolo had said was true, but a few Minutes after, con-firming it by his Words,
               "Gentlemen, said he, Ambrogiuolo has van-quished, I confess it, and am ready to pay him the Money he has won, whenever he comes to demand it."
               Accordingly the next Day Ambrogiuolo went to the Lodgings of Bernabo, who paid him the five Thousand Florins; and departing from Paris, went to Genoa, with a fell Soul against the betrayed Zinevra.
               
               As soon as he arrived, he retired to one of his Country Houses, at a small Distance from the Town, and there calling a faithful Ser-vant, he ordered him to get two Horses ready,

and carry a Letter from him to his Wife, im-porting his Desires, that she should return with the Bearer to him; and then gave a strict Com-mand to the Servant to murder her as soon as they came into a convenient Place.
               The Servant assured him of his Obedience, and rode immediately to Town with the Let-ter; which Zinevra receiving with great Joy, prepared herself for her Journey the next Morning; and accompanied only by the Per-son who came to fetch her, she took the Road to her Husband's Villa, discoursing as they went upon indifferent Things: when coming into a large and solitary Valley, sur-rounded with high Trees, the Servant, think-ing this a fit Place to execute his Master's Or-ders, suddenly stopt, and drawing out a large Knife seized the Lady by the Arm.
               "Madam, said he, recommend your Soul to God, for you must die in a few Moments."
               The Lady hearing these dreadful Words, and beholding the fatal Knife, all trembling with Fear and Surprize, cried out,
               "Oh! Mercy gracious Heaven! why will you murder me? Tell me in what I have of-fended you, that you resolve to kill me?"
               "Madam, replied the Servant, you have not offended me in any Thing, how you have offended your Husband I know not, but he has commanded me to murder you without

Mercy in this Place, and if I do not obey him, threatens to hang me.
               "You know by what Tyes I am bound to him, and that I have it not in my Power to re-fuse Compliance with any of his Orders; God knows I pity you; but I must execute his Will."
               "Oh grant me Mercy, for the Sake of Hea-ven! replied the Lady, all dissolved in Tears; do not become a Murderer of one who never injured you to please another.
               "God, from whom nothing is concealed, knows I never was guilty of any Action for which I merit this Usage from my Husband; but of that no more.
               "Suffer me only to represent to you how you may at once avoid offending God, please your Master, and serve me, and that in this Manner:
               "You may give me your upper Coat and Hat, and take my Cloaths, and returning with them to your Master, tell him you have mur-dered me; and I swear to you by that Preser-vation for which I shall be obliged to you, that I will keep myself concealed, and wander into some distant Place, and neither you or he shall ever hear of me again in this Country."
               The Servant, who was very unwilling to murder her, easily yielded to his Compassion and her Entreaties, and gave her his Coat and Hat, together with what Money he found a-bout her; and after earnestly desiring her to quit Genoa as soon as possible, took her Cloaths, and leaving her alone and on foot in the Val-ley,

               The fifth Novel of the eighth Decad of the Hecatomythi of Giraldi Cinthio.
               
               
                  THE Roman Empire was at the Heighth of it's Grandeur and Power, when Maximine, a great and virtuous Prince, reigned over it; this Emperor, who desired no-thing more ardently, than the Welfare and Hap-piness of all his Subjects, was extremely nice in the Choice of those Persons whom he deputed to govern the Provinces dependant on the Em-pire, assigning those Employments only to Men whose Integrity and Virtue were well known to him.
               

returned to his Master, to whom he de-clared, "that he had murdered her, and that her dead Body was devoured by the Wolves."
               The unhappy Lady being alone and discon-solate in the dreary Valley which had been destined for the Scene of her Murder, knew not whither to direct her Steps; but Night drawing on, and her Apprehensions of that dreadful Place encreasing with the approaching Darkness, she struck into a foot Path, which led at last to a little Village; and there going into the Cottage of an old Woman, procured some Necessaries fit for her Appearance as a Sailor, and thus clad, took her Way towards the Shore.
               There happening to meet with a Catalonian Gentleman, whose Ship lying near the Place, had landed to refresh himself at a Fountain; he entering into Discourse with the poor Wan-derer, supposing her to be a Man, at her Re-quest, received her as a Servant to wait upon his own Person.
               
                  Madonna Zinevra, who had taken the Name of Sicuranno, followed Signor Encarach, her new Master, to his Vessel; and, having better Cloaths given her, began to serve him so dili-gently, and with such Fidelity, that he soon conceived a great Esteem for her.
               Some time after, the Catalonian sailing with a Cargo to Alexandria, he took with him some very fine Falcons, which he presented to the

Sultan, who being pleased with the Gift, fre-quently invited the Merchant to his Table.
               
                  Sicuranno always attending his Master upon these Occasions, the Sultan was so well pleased with his Carriage and Behaviour, that he asked him of the Catalonian; who, though very un-willing to part with him, could not refuse the Sultan's Request, and therefore left him be-hind at Alexandria.
               
               
                  Sicuranno had not been long in the Sultan's Palace, before he acquired as great a Share of that Monarch's Confidence and Esteem, as of the Catalonian's, his former Master.
               It being a Custom, at a certain Time of the Year, to hold a Fair at Aeri, a City in the Dominions of the Sultan, to which a great ma-ny Christians and Saracen Merchants resort-ed, the Sultan, in whose Favour Sicuranno encreased daily, appointed him to command the Soldiers that were sent there, to guard the Merchants and their Goods while the Fair continued.
               
                  Sicuranno being now Captain of the Guard at Aeri, acquitted himself of this Charge with his accustomed Diligence and Exactness.
               Among the foreign Merchants which re-sorted to this Fair, there were several Venetian, Placentian, Genoese, and other Italians, with whom Sicuranno, who still had a great Fond-ness for his Country, frequently conversed.
               
                  
If happened one Day, when he was at the Warehouse of the Venetian Merchants, that, among other Trinkets, he saw a Purse and a Girdle, which he knew to have once belonged to himself; he was greatly surprized at the Sight of those Things, but concealing it from Observation, enquired whose they were? and if they were to be sold?
               
                  Ambrogiuolo, who had come to Alexandria with some other Merchants in a Venetian Vessel, being told that the Captain of the Guard was enquiring about these Things, came forward, and said, with a Smile "Sir, the Things are mine, and not to be sold; but if you have any Inclination for them, I will present you with them freely."
               
                  Sicuranno seeing him smile, suspected, that by some Means or other, he had discovered who he was; nevertheless, keeping a firm Countenance, he replied;
               "You smile, I suppose, because you see me, who am a military Man, enquiring about these female Trifles."
               "No, Sir, said Ambroguiolo, I do not smile at that, but at reflecting on the Manner in which I gained those Things."
               "Ah! I beseech you, said Sicuranno, hastily, let us know how you gained them then?"
               "Sir, replied Ambrogiuolo, these Things were given me by a Lady of Genoa, called Ma-donna Zinevra, the Wife of Bernabo Lomillin, with whom I had the Honour to pass a Night,

in her Husband's Absence; and she enteated me to keep them faithfully for her Sake: I smile, therefore, at reflecting on the stupid Fol-ly of her Husband, who was silly enough to lay five thousand Florins of Gold against a thousand of mine, that it was not in my Power to prevail over the Chastity of his Wife; this, however, I accomplished; he lost the Wager; and he who ought rather to have punished himself for his Stupidity, than his Wife for doing that which all Women will do, went to Genoa, and, as I have since heard, caused her to be mur-dered."
               
                  Sicuranno hearing this, knew this Man im-mediately to be the Cause of all his Misery, and resolved within himself to be severely re-venged on him; and in order to acomplish his Design, he feigned himself to be extremely well pleased with this Story, and began to en-ter into a strict Intimacy with Ambrogiuolo, whom he managed so artfully, that at last he confessed the whole Truth to him concerning the Stratagem by which he had deceived Ber-nabo, and gained the Wager.
               When the Fair was ended, Sicuranno, by large Promises, engaged Ambrogiuolo to go with him into Alexandria, where he procured him a Warehouse, and lodged Money in his Hands; so that Ambrogiuolo thinking he might be able to encrease his Fortune there, willing-ly stayed at Alexandria.
               
               
                  Sicuranno, who ardently desired to have his Innocence made known to Bernabo, practised

so well with some Genoese Merchants who were in that Country, that they prevailed up-on Bernabo, who was now reduced to very low Circumstances, to come to Alexandria; and Sicuranno caused him to be privately re-ceived there by some of his Friends.
               
                  Sicuranno, who had already made Ambro-giuolo recount to the Sultan the Story he had first told him, and which had pleased him great-ly, finding it now a proper Time to execute his Intention, since Bernabo was arrived, took an Opportunity to entreat the Sultan to give Orders, that Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo should be brought before him; and to make Ambro-giuolo, by Menaces (if he would not by gentle Methods) declare, if what he had boasted con-cerning the Wife of Bernabo was true.
               The Sultan consented; and the two Mer-chants being brought before him, he command-ed Ambrogiuolo, with a threatening Counte-nance, to confess truly, how he had won the five thousand Florins of Bernabo.
               
               
                  Ambrogiuolo seeing his Friend Sicuranno (who was present) look upon him with rageful Eyes, and threatening him with the most horrid Tor-ments if he did not reveal the Truth; pressed on every Side, and supposing the worst Conse-quence of his Confession would be the Restitu-tion of the Money and the Things, he re-lated the whole Affair just as it happened; and having finished his Narration, Sicuranno, as invested with Authority by the Sultan, turned to Bernabo, and asked him "what

Punishment he had inflicted upon his Wife on Account of that Lye?"
               "Sir, replied Bernabo, being inflamed with Rage for the Loss of my Money, and the Dis-grace my Wife's Infamy had brought upon me, I ordered a Servant to murder her, and, ac-cording to his Report, he did so, and her Body was soon after devoured by Wolves."
               These Facts thus laid open before the Sultan, and all that were present, who could not ima-gine what was to be the End of such an Exami-dation, Sicuranno, addressing himself to the Sultan, said:
               "My Lord, you may plainly perceive by their Confessions, what Reason this good Wo-man had to glory in a Lover and a Husband.
               "The Lover by an infamous Falshood robs her of her Honour, destroys her Fame, and deprives her of her Husband; and the Husband giving more Credit to the Falshoods of others than to the often experienced Truth of his Wife, commands her to be murdered, and her dead Body to be devoured by Wolves; and so great is the Affection which this Lover and Husband bore her, that they both continued with her a long Time, and neither of them dis-covered her.
               "That you may be able therefore to know this clearly, and give to each the Reward they have merited, grant me the Favour I am going to implore of you, which is to pardon the De-ceived and punish the Deceiver, and I will then make the injured Lady herself come into your Presence?"
               
                  
The Sultan, always disposed to comply with any Request of Sicuranno's, granted this im-mediately, and desired him to make the Lady come.
               
                  Bernabo, who firmly believed his Wife to be dead, was greatly astonished at this Propo-sition; and Ambrogiuolo began now to appre-hend he should suffer something worse than paying back the Money.
               
                  Sicuranno being thus assured of having her Request granted by the Sultan, cast herself at the Feet of that Monarch; the Tears fast streaming down her Cheeks, and losing with her assumed masculine Voice, the Desire of appearing masculine, spoke in this Manner.
               "My Lord, in me behold the injured, the unhappy Zinevra, who, through the wicked Falshoods of that Traitor Ambrogiuolo, have been obliged to wander miserably through the World in the Form of a Man, and by this cruel Husband doomed to be murdered and de-voured by Wolves.
               Then opening her Waistcoat, she discovered her Bosom, by which the Sultan, and all who were present, knowing her to be a Woman, were filled with Astonishment and Compas-sion.
               
                  Zinevra then turning to Ambrogiuolo, fierce-ly demanded of him. "when it was he had seduced her Virtue, as he had once openly boasted?"
               
                  Ambrogiuolo, who now knew her, and was struck dumb with Shame and Fear, answered nothing.
               
                  
The Sultan, who always believed her to be a Man, was so astonished at what he now saw and heard, that, for some Moments, he knew not whether all was not a Dream; but his Wonder ceasing, he began to praise, with the highest Expressions of Esteem, the Virtue, Constancy, and unblameable Manners of Zi-nevra, and gave Orders to have her magnifi-cently drest in a female Habit, appointed Wo-men to attend her, and, as he had promised, pardoned the deceived Husband Bernabo, who falling at the Feet of his Wife, entreated her also with Tears to forgive him.
               
                  Zinevra raised him up, and kindly assuring him that she would forget all that was past, threw herself into his Arms, and as her Hus-band embraced him tenderly.
               The Sultan then commanded Ambrogiuolo to be carried immediately to one of the highest Places in the City, and fastened to a Stake, his Body to be anointed with Honey, and exposed naked to the Sun, and there left to die; which was accordingly executed; after which he ordered all his Effects to be given to Zinevra, which amounted to ten thousand Pistoles; and make-ing a magnificent Feast, he publicly bestowed the highest Honours and Applauses on Zinevra for her Courage and Virtue, and presented her Husband and her with ten thousand Pistoles more, giving them Leave to depart, and a Ship to carry them back to Genoa; where they soon after arrived, extremely rich, and were received with great Honours by their Citizens;

especially Madonna Zinevra, who had been thought dead by every one, and who, from that Time till her Death, lived in the highest Reputation for Courage, Constancy and Vir-tue.
            
            
               

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of Cymbeline.
               
               THE Plot of the foregoing Novel forms one of the Actions of Shakespear's Tragedy, called Cymbeline; I say one of the Actions, because this Play, with his usual Ir-regularity, is composed of three or four dif-ferent ones.
               He has copied all those Circumstances from Boccacio, that were necessary to serve his De-sign; but he has entirely changed the Scene, the Characters, and the Manners; and that he has done so greatly for the worse, is I think easy to prove.
               
                  Boccaccio introduces some young Merchants in a Tavern, where two of them, being heated by Wine, lay a fantastical Wager; one that his Wife was absolutely chaste, and not to be corrupted by any Methods whatever.
               The other, that she was frail like the rest of the Sex; and that to prove it, he would prevail upon her in a very short Time to violate her Faith to her Husband.
               
                  
It happened, that the Government of In-spruck, a rich and populous City, became va-cant, which the Emperor resolved to bestow upon one of his Officers, named Juriste, a Man whose Fidelity he had often experienced, having been several Years near his Person, and, during that Time, had behaved with so much Wisdom and Prudence, that he had conceived a great Esteem for him.
               Having taken this Resolution in Favour of Juriste, he ordered his Attendance one Day in his Closet, and spoke to him as follows.
               "Juriste, the good Opinion I have con-ceived of you, from the Manner in which you have behaved yourself, since you have been in my Service, has determined me to be-stow the Government of Inspruck upon you. I might give you many Directions for your Conduct in this high Employment, but I shall confine them all to this one: Do Jus-tice to all Persons without any Distinction; let this be the Rule and Guide of all your Actions. Other Faults, which either through Negligence or Ignorance, you may hap-pen to commit, I possibly may excuse; but any Act of Injustice I will never par-don. Since it is not given to every Man to be able to practise all the Virtues, if you are conscious of any Defect in your Temper, which may incline you to act with less Im-partiality than I require, do not accept of this Government, but continue here in my Court, where your Services are very agree-able to me, and do not lay me under the Necessity of doing what will be very pain-ful

                  Shakespear makes the Lady in Question, not the Wife of a Merchant, but the Heiress of a great Kingdom.
               The Husband, who lays so indiscreet a Wager, not a simple Trader intoxicated with Liquor, but a young, noble, though unfor-tunate Hero, whom, for the extraordinary Qua-lities of his Mind and Person, the Princess had secretly married.
               And the Scenes, instead of a Tavern in Paris, and the House of a private Family in the Court of Britain, and the Chamber of the Princess.
               To this injudicious Change of the Charac-ters is owing all the Absurdities of this Part of Shakespear's Plot; he has given the Man-ners of a Tradesman's Wife, and two Mer-chants intoxicated with Liquor, to a great Princess, an English Hero, and a noble Roman.
               The King, enraged at Posthumus for dar-ing to marry his Daughter, contents himself with only sending him into Banishment, and presses the Princess to take for another Hus-band a Man whom she detests, while her first is only divided from her by a very incon-siderable Distance, and while there is a Proba-bility of meeting him again.
               Since he was so resolutely bent upon mak-ing her marry the stupid Son of his second Wife, surely it would have more facilitated his Design, to have either taken away the Life of Posthumus, or kept him in a strict and secret Confinement, and by that Means

have deprived the Princess of all Hope of ever seeing him; but Posthumus must only be ba-nished to make Way for the scandalous Wager.
               This adoring and obliged Husband of a beautiful and virtuous Princess, no sooner ar-rives at Rome, but he engages in a ridiculous Dispute concerning the Beauty, Wit, and Chastity of his Lady; and tamely suffers one of his Roman Friends, to maintain that she was as liable to be corrupted as any other of her Sex.
               The Dispute growing warm, the Roman engages to take a Journey to Britain, and corrupt the Chastity of the Princess, which, if he accomplishes, Posthumus is to reward him with the Ring that she had given him at parting; and to facilitate his Design, writes a Letter to the Princess, recommending Jachimo to her as one of his most valued Friends.
               
                  Jachimo accordingly arrives in Britain, de-livers his Letter to the Princess, and is very kindly received.
               It must be observed that the Princess is strictly guarded by the King's Orders, and this is very natural, since he intended to force her to marry her stupid Step-brother.
               But how comes it that this confined Princess, guarded by her Father's Guards, and watched by her Mother-in-law's Spies, should be able to give an Audience to a foreign Stranger, who comes from the very Place where her ba-nished Husband resides?
               
                  
We see no Stratagem made use of to elude the Vigilance of her Guards; no Bribes given to buy the Secresy of Spies.
               The Friend of her banished Husband is introduced by his Confident, who though known to be so, both by the King, Queen, and Rival of Posthumus, is still permitted to attend her.
               This is not indeed very probable, but it is absolutely necessary for the Plot, because this faithful Confident is to carry the Princess af-terwards into a dark Wood, in order to kill her, by his Master's Orders.
               So the Story goes in Boccaccio, so also goes the Plot in the Tragedy.
               There is only this small Difference, that in Boccacio it is a private Gentlewoman, who, attended with one Servant, rides a small Jour-ney to meet her Husband at his Country House.
               But in Shakespear, it is the Heiress of a great Kingdom, who notwithstanding her Guards, the Dignity of her Station, and Weakness of her Sex, rides Post with one Man Servant to a Sea-port Town, for a short. View of her Husband. But of this hereafter.
               Let us see how Jachimo begins his Court-ship to this great Princess: After having insi-nuated into her Bosom some jealous Suspici-ons of her Husband's Constancy, he goes on to praise her Beauty familiarly enough, consi-dering he had but a few Minutes Acquaint-ance with her Highness.
               
                  
Then begs Leave to "dedicate himself to her sweet Pleasure," and supposing the Bar-gain concluded, offers to kiss her.
               The Princess calls Pisanio, her Husband's Confident; he happens not to be within hear-ing; and this is very convenient, for there is a Necessity for a long Conversation to make all right again, for the second Part of Jachimo's Stratagem.
               Her Highness then turns to her impudent Gallant, tells him, "if he had been honour-able he would not have sought such a base End of her," and that she "disdains him and the Devil alike."
               The Gallant upon this Lucretia-like De-nial, changes his Note, praises the Virtue and Constancy of her Husband, and assures her, he only made this Attempt on her Chastity, in order to try if she was really as pure as she was believed to be.
               Her Highness is pacified, professes herself his faithful Friend, and offers him all her In-terest in the Court.
               
                  Jachimo waves this princely Offer; but de-sires her to allow him to put a Chest of Goods under her Care for one Night, to which the Princess consenting, assures him his Chest shall be placed in her own Bed-Chamber.
               Upon this Expedient the whole Plot turns.
               
                  Jachimo, concealed in the Chest, furnishes himself like Ambrogiuolo, with Proofs of his hav-ing dishonoured the Lady, and, returning to Posthumus, declares he has won the Wager.
               
                  

                  Posthumus, satisfied with his Proof, though the Honour of a Princess, and of a Princess who loved him to Distraction, was in Ques-tion, dispatches Orders to his Servant to kill her; and to give him an Opportunity to exe-cute his Commands, writes to the Princess that he is at Milford-Haven, supposing that this Intelligence will bring her immediately to meet him.
               To pass by the Absurdity of supposing a great Princess, guarded by an incensed Fa-ther, and the jealous Vigilance of a designing Step-Mother, should be able to leave the Court, and ride like a Market-Woman with a single Attendant to meet him; what Reason had he to expect such a dange-rous Proof of Affection from a Woman, who had so easily been prevailed upon to violate the Faith she had lately given him?
               The Wife of Bernabo the Merchant might indeed find it necessary to keep herself unsuspected by her Husband, since her Hap-piness depended upon his believing her vir-tuous.
               But the Princess's Constancy to Posthumus was the Cause of her Disgrace; by marrying Cloten she might regain her Liberty, and con-sequently have better Opportunities of follow-ing her private Intrigues.
               But what Inducement could she have for incurring the Resentment of the King her Father, only to seem constant to a banished Man, whom she was dishonouring in pri-vate?
               
                  
Her Constancy to Posthumus in Defiance of her Father's Anger, could only be the Effect of a violent Passion for him; but her aban-doning herself to a loose Intrigue with his Friend, was absolutely inconsistent with her Love for him.
               If Posthumus then believed her unchaste, he could not possibly expect she would endea-vour to preserve the least Appearance of Fi-delity, since it was her Interest to abandon him publicly, much less endanger her Per-son by so extraordinary an Effect of Love and Obedience as that he required of her.
               The injured Princess however is impatient to be on Horseback, she whips out of the Palace in a Minute, and passes invisibly, we cannot help supposing, though there is no In-chantment in the Case, through the midst of her Attendants and Guards, and gallops away to meet her Husband.
               When she arrives in the destined Wood, Pisanio acquaints her with the Orders he had received to kill her, and his fixed Resolution not to obey them.
               The Princess indeed puts a very pertinent Question to him.
               
                  Imo.
                  Wherefore then
                  Didst undertake it? why hast thou abused
                  So many Miles, with a Pretence? this Place?
                  Mine Action? and thine own? our Horses labour.
                  The Time inviting thee? the perturb'd Court,
                  For my being absent? whereunto I never
                  
                     
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far
                  To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy Stand,
                  Th' elected Deer before thee?
               
               
                  Shakespear no doubt foresaw his Readers would ask this Question if the Princess did not, but though he found it an easy Matter to make Pisanio satisfy her as to that Particular, the Reader is not so easily answered.
               For why indeed did he bring her into so shocking a Situation, if he resolved not to murder her? Why did he not acquaint her with the cruel Orders of her Husband while she was in her Father's Palace?
               If it was a bold and hazardous Action to quit the Court in such a strange Equipage, to have a short Conference with a faithful Hus-band, why must she expose herself to so emi-nent a Danger, only to be told of the Cruelty and Injustice of that Husband?
               But the Truth is, she has a great many strange Adventures to come yet, and these must be brought about at the Expence of Pro-bability.
               But what Resolution does the Heiress of Britain take after being told that her Husband, believing her to be an Adulteress, had ordered her to be killed.
               One would imagine, that full of a just Dis-dain for so vile and scandalous a Suspicion, the Pride of injured Virtue, affronted Dignity, and Rage of ill requited Love, would have carried her back to the Court, there by dis-claiming all future Faith and Tenderness for

the unworthy Posthumus, restore herself to the Affection of her Father, and all the Rights of her royal Birth.
               No, she only weeps, complains, reproaches a little, and then resolves to dress herself in the Habit of a Boy, and wander a-foot to procure a Service.
               Here Shakespear drops Boccacio, after having servilely copied from him all the Incidents which compose this Part of the Plot of Cymbeline; but by changing the Scene and Characters has made these Incidents absurd, unnatural, and improbable.
               The rest of the Play is equally inconsistent, and if Shakespear invented here for himself, his Imagination is in this one Instance full as bad as his Judgment.
               His Princess forgetting that she had put on Boy's Cloaths to be a Spy upon the Actions of her Husband, commences Cook to two young Forresters and their Father, who live in a Cave; and we are told how nicely she sauced the Broths.
               
                  Guid.
                  "But his neat Cookery!
               
               
                  Arv.
                  He cut our Roots in Characters,
                  And sauc'd our Broth, as Juno had been sick,
                  And he her Dieter.
               
               Certainly this Princess had a most oecono-mical Education; however she is to change her Situation, seem dead, be buried, and come to Life again, and hire herself to a new Master."
               
                  
To bring all this about, Shakespear makes her drink a Potion, resembling that of Juliet's in its Effects; this Potion is tempered by the Queen's Physician, whom she had desired to prepare her a Poison.
               
                  Pisanio being in the Queen's Apartment when the Drug was brought in, looked ear-nestly at it, which the Queen observing, desir-ed him to accept of it, telling him it was a fine Cordial.
               The Physician, who is by, whispers Pisanio, that the Queen having desired him to prepare her some mortal Poison, he had given her a Drug, which would only make the Person that drank of it fall into a Sleep, resembling Death.
               One would think Pisanio was sufficiently warned, yet we find him giving this Drug to the Princess when he left her in the Wood, as-suring her it was a rich Cordial given him by the Queen, and intreating her to drink some of it when she was sick.
               This Blunder however produces a great many other Events; Imogen thought to be dead, is buried by the young Foresters (who are her Brothers, though unknown) in the Wood.
               
                  Cloten follows the Princess with an Intention, as he declares, "to ravish her, and then kick her back to Court," and is disguised in the Cloaths of Posthumus, though there is no other Reason for his being thus disguised, but only that the Princess may afterwards suppose him Posthumus when she finds him dead. Being af-terwards killed by the Brothers of Imogen, one of them cuts off his Head, and buries him beside the supposed Youth.
               
                  
It may seem a little shocking for a generous young Man, a Prince, though he did not know as himself, to cut off the Head of his Enemy, it ter having killed him; but his Head must be cut off, or else how could Imogen mistake him for her Lord?
               The Princess awaking from her Trance, supposes she is travelling to Milford-Haven, and cries, "Ods pittikens, is it six Miles yet?" recovering her Senses perfectly, and seeing a headless Man lying near, drest in the Cloaths of Posthumus, she laments over him, believing him to be her Husband.
               This is indeed a very pathetic Distress; but what does the unhappy Heiress of Britain do, now she thinks her Husband is killed? Why she accepts the Post of Page to the Enemy of her Father and Country; who, with a hostile Army, is wasting the Kingdom, over which, by Right of Birth, she is to reign.
               But why does the Princess disgrace her Sex and Dignity by accepting so scandalous an Employment? Is it the Fear of Death from the Romans? No, certainly there is no such Thing threatened.
               Besides, a Lady, fond to Distraction of a Husband whom she finds lying murdered by her, can hardly be supposed so attentive to her own Danger in those distressful Moments as to provide so cunnningly for her Safety.
               However, the Princess, full of Despair as she is, dresses up a clever Tale in a Trice; invents a Name for her murdered Husband; calls herself his Page; says he was slain by

to me, which is the punishing you seve-rely for any Act against Justice, and there-by acquitting what I myself owe to it."
               
                  Juriste, who was greatly pleased with the honourable Employment the Emperor had be-stowed upon him, thanked his Majesty for it with much Submission: "Doubt not, my gra-cious Lord, added he, but that I will most exactly perform what you require, and bend my whole Thoughts towards the Preservation of Justice, and so much the more will I make it my continual Study, as your Words have kindled a glorious Emulation in my Soul, to deserve, if possible, not your Approbation only, but your Praises."
               "It is well, said the Emperor, much pleased with this Reply; if your Actions are as good as your Words I shall indeed have great Cause to praise you;" then ordering the Letters Patent to be made out, he invested Juriste with full Authority in his Government, and sent him away immediately to take Possession of it.
               
                  Juriste, as soon as he arrived at Inspruck, applied himself with great Diligence to the Ad-ministration of Justice, not only in rewarding Virtue and punishing Vice, but in filling all the inferior Posts and Offices with Men of ap-proved Virtue and Wisdom; so that by this Conduct he increased the Emperor's Esteem of him, and acquired the Love of all the In-habitants of Inspruck.
               
               In the heighth of his Reputation for Wisdom and Justice, it happened that a young Man, named Lodovico, a Citizen of Inspruck, ra-vished

Mountaineers; and expresses her Fears that she should never get so good a Master.
               Hereupon Lucius takes her to be his Page; and her Highness goes off very well contented with her Situation.
               It would be an endless Task to take Notice of all the Absurdities in the Plot, and unnatu-ral Manners in the Characters of this Play.
               Such as the ridiculous Story of the King's two Sons being stolen in their Infancy from the Court, and bred up in the Mountains of Wales till they were twenty Years of Age.
               Then, at their first Essay in Arms, these Striplings stop the King's Army, which is flying from the victorious Romans, oblige them to face their Enemies, and gain a compleat Victory.
               With Inconsistencies like these it every where abounds; the whole Conduct of the Play is absurd and ridiculous to the last De-gree, and with all the Liberties Shakespear has taken with Time, place and Action, the Sto-ry, as he has managed it, is more improbable than a Fairy Tale.
               As Mr. Pope observes, little more than the Names in this Play is historical.
               
                  Hollingshead says in his Chronicle, "that Cymbeline was in such Favour with Augustus Caesar, whom he had served in the Wars, that he left him at Liberty either to pay or not to pay his Tribute, as he pleased;" which Cir-cumstance is thus used by Shakespear.
               
               
                  

                  Augustus sends to demand the Payment of the Tr
                     â€¢
                  bute which had been, by the wicked Counsels of the King's second Wife, neglected: Cymbeline, according to the Queen's Directions, refuses to pay it: Hereupon War is declared; an Army of Romans comes into Britain; the King's Forces are put to Flight; but being rallied, and led on again by two Boys in a nar-row Lane, they give the Romans a total De-feat, and take their General Prisoner; and after this Victory the King pays the Tribute which he had before so peremptorily refused.
            
            
               

               The ninth Novel of the third Day of the Decamerone of Boccaccio.
               
               
                  A Nobleman of the Kingdom of France, named Esnard, Count of Roussillon, being of a weak and sickly Constitution, always kept a Physician, named Ge-rard de Narbonne, in his House. This Count had one only Son, called Ber-trand; he was extremely handsome and of a sweet and gentle Disposition; the Count caused several young Boys of his Age to be educated with him; among whom there was also a little Girl, named Giletta, Daughter to the Phy-sician.
               This Girl loved Bertrand with a Tender-ness and Ardor very uncommon to one of her Age.
               The Count dying, left his Son under the Guardianship of the King; and his Majesty sending Orders for him to come to Paris, Gi-letta, whose Affection encreased with her

Years, remained in the utmost Affliction at Roussillon.
               
               The Physician dying soon after the young Count's Departure, Giletta would have set out for Paris to see her beloved Bertrand; but being a great Fortune, her Conduct was care-fully watched; and not being able to find a reasonable Excuse for such a Journey, she was obliged for the present to quit her Design.
               Growing now of Years fit to be married, her Relations proposed several Matches to her, which she, without explaining the true Cause, refused, the secret Passion she had long felt for Bertrand gaining Strength by the Reports she had continually heard of his extraordinary Beauty and Accomplishments, she resolved never to give her Hand to any other Man.
               But while she was languishing with a hope-less Desire of seeing the Count, News came that the King of France was extremely ill; a Swelling in his Stomach having been badly treated, had turned to a Fistula; and the An-guish he felt from his Distemper was encreased by his Despair of ever getting it cured; no Physician being found that was able to remove it, notwithstanding great Numbers had been tried, who had all left it worse than before.
               The King, therefore, in the utmost Des-pair at their bad Success, would no longer ad-mit of Advice or Assistance.
               
                  Giletta, overjoyed at this News, thought she had now not only a good Excuse for go-ing to Paris, but if the King's Distemper was

what she believed it to be, there was also a Possibility of gaining Bertrand for a Husband.
               Her Father having discovered to her many valuable Secrets of his Art, she made a Pow-der of a certain Herb, which she had been taught by him was a Remedy for the Dis-ease she imagined the King was afflicted with; and privately getting a Horse prepared for her, went immediately to Paris.
               
               Her first Care after her Arrival was to gain a Sight of her dear Bertrand; and then pro-curing an Audience of the King, she earnest-ly entreated him to let her look at the Swel-ling.
               The King seeing her so young and hand-some, could not refuse her Request; as soon as she saw it, she immediately entertained Hopes of curing him, and said, "Sire, if you are willing, I trust in God I shall be able, without giving you much Pain or Fatigue, to cure you of this Distemper in eight Days."
               The King laughing at these solemn As-surances, replied, "Since the greatest Phy-sicians in the World have not been able to cure me, how is it possible a young Woman should perform what was too difficult for them; I give you thanks for your good Will, but I am determined never more to follow any Pre-scription whatever."
               "Sire, replied Giletta, you despise my Art because I am young, and a Woman; I am not indeed a Physician; nor is it by my own Know-ledge that I pretend to cure you; but by the Help of God, and the Knowledge of Gerard

de Narbonne, who was my Father, and when he was alive, a celebrated Physician."
               The King, being moved with these Words, began to reason with himself in this Manner:
               "This Woman, perhaps, is sent by Provi-dence for my Relief; ought I not, at least, to try what she can do? especially since she says she will cure me in a little Time, and that too without much Pain:" Then having taken his Resolution, he said, "But, Damsel, if after having made me break through my Resolves, you do dot cure me, what Punishment are you willing to submit to?"
               "Sire, answered Giletta, make me be care-fully guarded, and, if after the Expiration of eight Days, I do not cure you, sentence me to be burnt; but if I do cure you, what shall be my Recompence?"
               "You seem to me, said the King to be still unmarried; if you perform what you have pro-mised, I will give you a rich and honourable Husband."
               "Truly, Sire, said Giletta, I am very well pleased with your Design of marrying me; but I must be at Liberty to name my Husband, and no Person whatever, except those of the Royal Blood, must be refused me."
               The King agreed to her Request imme-diately, and promised her it should be punctu-ally complied with.
               
                  Giletta, thereupon, began to administer her Medicine, which she pursued so happily, that before the Time prefixed, she restored him to Health.
               
                  
The King feeling himself perfectly cured, said to her, "Damsel, you have well gained your Husband." "Then, Sire, she replied, I have gained Bertrand, Count of Roussillon, whom I began to love in my Infancy, and have ever since loved with the most ardent Af-fection.
               The King thought her Demand very high, but as he had given his Promise he was resolved not to break it, and ordered Bertrand to be called; to whom he said; "Count, you are now grown a Man, and perfected in all the Accomplishments of a Nobleman; it is my Will, therefore, that you should take upon you the Government of your Country, and carry with you the Damsel I have given you for a Wife." "And who is that Damsel, Sire, replied the Count?" "That is she, said the King, who with her Medicines has restored me to Health."
               
                  Bertrand, as soon as he looked upon her, immediately remembered her; and though her Person appeared to him extremely handsome, yet, sensible of the Disproportion of her Birth to his, he answered, with great Disdain, "What! Sire, would you give me a female Quack for a Wife?' God forbid I should ever be the Husband of such a Woman."
               "Will you then, replied the King, make me break my Word with this young Maid, who demanded you for a Husband in Reward for restoring me to Health?
               "Sire, replied Bertrand, you may take away all I possess; and, by the Power you have over me, give me to whom you please;

but, it is certain, I never shall be contented with such a Marriage."
               "You will be happy, no doubt, replied the King; the Damsel is fair and wise; she loves you ardently; and I hope you will enjoy a more agreeable Life with her, than with a Lady of noble Birth."
               
                  Bertrand being silent, the King gave Or-ders to make great Preparations for the Nup-tials; and when the determined Day came, Bertrand, though unwillingly, married Gi-letta in the Presence of the King.
               The Ceremony over, the Count, having taken his Resolution, desired the King's Per-mission to return to his Country, there to consummate the Marriage: The King grant-ing his Request, he mounted his Horse, but instead of going to Roussillon went into Tus-cany, and knowing that the Florentines were at War with the Republic of Sienna, he offered his Service to the first, who received him gladly, paid him great Honours, and gave him the Command of a Regiment, with large Appointments, which prevailed upon him to continue in their Service.
               In the mean time, the new-married Lady, little pleased with such a Disappointment, flattered herself, that by her prudent Behaviour, she should be able to recall him; and being re-ceived at Roussillon with all the Honours due to the Wife of Count Bertrand, she applied her-self in the Absence of her Lord to the Ma-nagement of his Affairs, which she performed with so much Solicitude and Discretion, that

all the People at Roussillon were extremely pleased with her wise Government, held her in the utmost Esteem and Affection, and greatly blamed their Lord for his unkind Be-haviour to her.
               Having put every Thing at Roussillon into exact Order, she sent two Gentlemen to her Lord, whom she ordered to acquaint him, that if her Presence was the Cause of his Ab-sence from his Country, to make him easy, and to engage him to return, she would quit Roussillon for ever. To this Messuage the Count replied with great Harshness;
               "Tell her she may do what she pleases, and assure her that I am determined never to live with her as my Wife, till she gets this Ring which I wear on my Finger into her Possession, and has a Son begot by me in her Arms; both which cannot possibly happen, as I never intend to see her more."
               The two Gentlemen thought these hard Conditions, and after long solliciting him in vain to change his Purpose, returned to the Lady, and related to her his Answer.
               The unhappy Giletta, greatly afflicted at this Account, deliberated with herself a long Time on the Means she should use to accom-plish those two Things, and retrieve her Hus-band.
               After much Thought, she at last assembled all the best and wisest of the Count's Sub-jects, and in very moving Language relat-ed all she had done through her Affection for the Count, his Disdain of her, his Unkind-ness and obstinate Resolution never to live

with her, and lastly, declared that she was determined not to keep her Lord in perpetual Banishment by her Stay at Roussillan, but to retire and pass the remainder of her Life in Pilgrimage and devout Works for the Salva-tion of her Soul; intreating them to take great Care of the Affairs of the Country, and to signi-fy to their Lord that she had quitted Roussillon, with a fixed Resolution never to return thither any more.
               While she was speaking many Tears were shed by the good People to whom she addres-sed herself, who all humbly intreated her to change her Resolution, and continue among them; but she was immoveable, and recom-mending them to God, took Leave of them.
               Then furnishing herself with Money and rich Jewels, she set out in the Habit of a Pil-grim, attended by a Chambermaid and one of her Cousins, and took the Road to Florence, never stopping till she reached that City.
               Arriving there, she hired a Lodging in a Inn which was kept by a good Widow, and passing for a poor Pilgrim, remained there in Hopes of hearing something about her Lord.
               She had not been long in the Inn when Bertrand happened to pass by the Door on Horseback, with a great Retinue.
               
                  Giletta knew him immediately, but endea-vouring to suppress the Emotions his unex-pected Sight gave her; she took Occasion as he passed, to enquire of her Landlady his Name and Condition.
               
                  

a young Maid of the same City; her Relations complaining to Juriste of this Injury, he ordered Lodovico to be seized, and carried to Prison, who confessing the Fact, was, ac-cording to a Law in force there, condemned to lose his Head.
               The unfortunate Youth had a Sister, named Epitia, a Virgin of most exquisite Beauty, and but just entered into her sixteenth Year; Na-ture had not only been lavish in the Graces she had bestowed on her Form, but endowed her also with a most excellent Understanding, which had been well improved by the Study of Philosophy, her Father having spared no Expence in the Education of his Children.
               This Sentence gave great Affliction to E-pitia, who loved her Brother with the most tender Affection; reflecting however, that her Sorrow was of no Use to her Brother, she re-strained her Tears, and took a Resolution to attempt something to deliver him.
               For this Purpose she sent to intreat an Au-dience of the Governor, which being granted, she appeared before him, and throwing herself at his Feet, thus spoke to him.
               "I come, my Lord, to implore your Com-passion for my Brother, my only Brother, who, though he has indeed incurred the Sentence of the Law, yet, through your milder Justice, will, I hope, find it miti-gated: Reflect, my Lord, I beseech you, on his early Youth, his Inexperience in Life, and the Force of that unhappy Pas-sion, which caused his Crime; reflect also that his Crime, though great, is not a com-plicated
Who replied that he was a Foreigner, cal-led Count Bertrand, remarkable for his Po-liteness and Affability, and added, that he was very much in love with a Neighbour of hers, a young Woman well born, and very virtuous, but so poor that no one was willing to marry her; and that her Mother being a discreet, sensible Woman, perceiving the Count's Passion for her Daughter, took great Care to preserve her from his dishonourable Attempts.
               The Countess after enquiring and getting all the Information she was able from her Landlady, concerning this Woman and her Daughter, retired to reflect upon what she had heard, and weighing well every Parti-cular Circumstance in her Mind, she con-ceived a Design of turning the Count's Infi-delity to her own Advantage.
               But concealing her Intentions from her two Attendants, she went privately one Day in her Pilgrim's Habit to the House of her Rival, and easily getting Admittance, found her Landlady had not misrepresented the Condi-tion of these good People, whose extream Poverty was very discernible from every Thing about them.
               The Countess on her Entrance saluted the Mother with great Civility, and desired the Favour of some private Discourse with her.
               The Gentlewoman rising, told her she was ready to hear her, and led her into another

Chamber, where as soon as they were seated, the Countess began in this Manner.
               "My good Lady, I perceive that Fortune is as much your Enemy as mine, but if you are willing, 'tis in your Power to give your-self as well as me Consolation."
               The good Woman replied, "that she de-sired nothing so much as to procure herself Relief, provided she could do it honestly."
               "'Tis necessary then, said the Countess, that I should rely on your Fidelity, but if you deceive me, you will ruin my Design and hurt your own Interest."
               "You may tell me whatever you please with great Secresy, replied the Gentlewoman, you shall never find me deceitful."
               "The Countess then beginning her Story with her Love of Count Bertrand while she was yet a Child; pursued it through all its Circumstances till she brought it down to the present Time; relating every Thing in so af-fecting and artless a Manner, that the good Woman could not doubt the Truth of what she said, and began to have great Compassion for her.
               "'Tis only by your Means, added the Countess, that I can accomplish those two Conditions, upon which my Happiness de-pends, if what I hear be true, that my Hus-band loves your Daughter."
               "I know not, Madam, replied the Gen-tlewoman, whether the Count really loves my Daughter, but I know that he makes great

Professions of it; but what is it you would desire of me? how is it in my Power to serve you?"
               "I will tell you, replied the Countess, but first you must let me know how I shall return the Obligation you are able to confer upon me?"
               "I see your Daughter is handsome, and old enough to be married, and by what I have heard, and now observe, you keep her at Home for want of a Portion to marry her, I intend therefore to reward the Service you may do me, by giving her immediately as much Money as you shall think necessary to marry her honourably."
               The good Woman, who was in great Ne-cessity, was pleased with the Offer, but being cautious and discreet, replied,
               "Madam, tell me what it is you require of me, and if I can do it honestly I will, and you shall afterwards make what Acknowledg-ments you please."
               "You must then, said the Countess, send some Person in whom you can confide to Count Bertrand, to let him know that your Daughter will consent to his Desires, but that in order to be convinced of the Truth of that Passion he pretends for her, he must send by her Messenger that Ring which he wears on his Finger, and that done, she will be ready to grant all he requires.
               "This Message will certainly bring him to your House, I will be concealed in your Daughter's Chamber, and supply her Place;

perhaps I may be so fortunate as to prove with Child by him, and thus by your Assistance, having the Ring on my Finger, and a Child in my Arms begat by him, I may at last ac-quire his Affection, and prevail with him to live with me for the future as his Wife."
               The good Woman was at first startled at this Request of the Countess's, fearing her Daughter's Reputation might suffer if she complied with it.
               But reflecting that it would be a good Ac-tion to procure the Love of a Husband to a Wife that deserved it; she not only promised the Countess to perform all she desired, but in a few Days sent a Messenger with great Se-cresy to the Count, who hearing the Message, notwithstanding he thought it hard to give away his Ring, complied with his Mistress's Command, and came to her Appointment.
               
                  Giletta being dextrously conveyed into the Chamber instead of the young Woman, the Count passed the Night with her, retiring very early the next Morning for fear of giving any Occasion for Slander; but he renewed his Visits every Night, always believing it was his beloved Mistress who received him.
               The Countess finding herself with Child, would no longer admit the nightly Visits of her Husband, and calling for her Benefactress, said,
               "Madam, I have (Thanks to God and your Assistance) accomplished what I desired,

and it is now Time to know what I can do for you in Return."
               The good Woman told her she might do what she pleased, but that for her Part she de-sired no Reward for the Service she had done her, having only in her Opinion done what she ought.
               The Countess expressed herself pleased with her modest Reply, but insisted upon her naming a Portion for her Daughter.
               The Gentlewoman thus constrained with great Hesitation and much Shame, asked a hundred Pounds.
               The Countess seeing her Confusion, and admiring the Moderation of her Demand, gave her five Hundred Pounds in Money, and Jewels to the Value of five Hundred more, and taking Leave of the Mother and Daughter returned to her Inn.
               The good Woman, who was enriched greatly beyond her Expectations, sent Word to the Count to forbear his Visits, and retired with her Daughter into the Country to some of her Relations.
               
                  Bertrand being informed that his Wise had left Roussillon, yielded to the Desires of his Peo-ple, and went thither, which the Countess hearing, was extremely pleased, and resolved to stay at Florence till she was brought to Bed.
               When the Time was expired she was de-livered of two Sons, both very like their Fa-ther, and as soon as she was able to bear the Fatigue of Travelling she left Florence, and

came without being known by any one to Montpellier; there she rested two or three Days, and then with her Children took the Road to Roussillon.
               
               On her Arrival she enquired after the Health of her Lord, and hearing that he was well, and was that Day giving a great Feast to some Noblemen and Ladies in his Palace, she presented herself in the Hall where they were all assembled, wearing the Habit of a Pilgrim, in which she had left Roussillon, and holding her two Sons in her Arms: Then throw-ing herself at the Feet of her Husband with Tears streaming from her Eyes, she said.
               "My Lord, I am your unhappy Wife, who, abandoned by you, did notwithstanding apply myself diligently to the Management of your Affairs; I have long wandered miserably about the World, and now come to demand you in the Name of God, since I have been able to accomplish those two Conditions you proposed by the Gentleman I sent to you; look on me, my Lord, and behold in my Arms not only one Son by you but two, behold likewise your Ring, and according to your Promise receive and acknowledge me for your Wife.
               The Count, who had listened attentively to her, was struck motionless with Astonish-ment. He knew the Ring, and observed the Children to be very like him, and wholly lost in the Perplexity into which those Accidents had thrown him, he asked her how it could be?
               
                  
The Countess then, to the great Amaze-ment of her Lord and all who were present, related every Circumstance that had happen-ed to her since her Departure from Roussillon.
               
               
                  Bertrand being convinced of the Truth of what she said, was struck with her Per-severance and Wisdom, and gazing on the Children, which he knew by their Resem-blance to him to be his own, mindful of the Promise he had made her, and moved with the Remonstrances of the Ladies and Gentle-men that were with him, and the Intreaties of his People, who all conjured him to re-ceive and acknowledge her, his Obstinacy at last gave Way.
               He raised the Countess from her Knees, embraced her tenderly, acknowledged her to be his lawful Wife, and the Children she brought with her his Sons. And then giving Orders for her being drest according to her Rank and Fortune, passed the rest of that Day and many others following, in Feasting and rejoycing, to the great Satisfaction of all the People in Roussillon.
               
               From this Time he always lived with her as his Wife, esteemed and honoured her for her Virtues, and loved her with the greatest De-gree of Tenderness.
            
            
               

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing Novel in his Comedy of All's Well that ends Well.
               
               The Fable of All's Well that ends Well.
               
               
                  BERTRAM, the young Count of Roussillon, having lost his Father, is left un-der the Guardianship of the King of France, who sends Orders for him to come to Court.
               
                  Helena, the Daughter of a famous Physi-cian, lately deceased, being violently in Love with the Count, resolves to follow him to Paris.
               
               The old Countess of Roussillon, Mother to Bertram, who is very fond of Helena, being informed that she was in Love with her Son, questions her about it, which after some eva-sive Answers, she at last confesses, and also acknowledges her Intention to go to Paris, to offer her Service to cure the King, who was sick of a Fistula, which by his Physicians was pronounced incurable.
               The Countess permits her to go, and the King, after many Intreaties, submits to make Use of her Medicine; which effects his Cure.
               
                  Helena before the Trial obliges the King to promise, that if he was restored to Health by

her Applications, he would give her her Choice of a Husband among those Persons he had a Right to dispose of.
               Accordingly when the Cure is compleated, she demands Count Bertram.
               
               The King orders him to marry her; he re-fuses on account of the meanness of her Birth; the King insisting upon his Obedience, Bertram at last complies, and seemingly with great Wil-lingness, but when the Ceremony is performed, declares to a Confident that he hates his new Wife, and is determined never to live with her, but will go to the Wars in Tuscany to avoid it.
               He then sends a flattering Message to Helena, and desires that she will take Leave of the King immediately, and give him to understand that this sudden Parting proceeds from her own earnest Inclinations to be gone.
               
                  Helena complies with this Injunction, and meeting her Lord, he excuses his Absence for two Days to her, gives her a Letter to carry to his Mother, and bids her hasten to Roussillon.
               
               She departs, and he having thus got rid of her, steals immediately to Florence.
               
               The old Countess of Roussillon is extremely enraged at the Contents of her Son's Letter, which informs her that he is determined never to live with his new Wife, and a Billet is delivered to Helena also, upon her Ar-rival at Roussillon, containing these Words. "When thou canst get the Ring upon my Finger, which never shall come off, and

shew me a Child begotten of thy Body that I am Father to, then call me Husband, but in such a then I write never."
               
                  Helena in Despair at this cruel Epistle, and desirous that her Presence might not banish her Lord from Roussillon, steals away at Night, leaving a Letter for her Mother-in-law, in which she informs her that she is gone a bare-foot Pilgrimage to St. Jaques, entreats her to recall her Son from the Wars, and declares, "that she is going to embrace Death to give him Freedom;" however, she stops at Flo-rence, meets with a Widow, whose Daughter, Diana, the Count was in Love with, and prevailing upon these two Women, by large Sums of Money, to assist her in her Design upon her Husband, she supplies Diana's Place in the Assignation she had made by her Advice with the Count, and gets the Ring which he had presented her in her own Possession, giving him in Return another which she had received from the King.
               A feigned Account of her Death, confirmed by the Rector of the Place where she died, being carried to Roussillon, the old Countess sends the News to her Son, entreating him to return, which he does immediately; and the King, being then at Roussillon, pardons the Count for his unkind Usage of Helena, whose Loss he seems greatly to regret, and the Daughter of an old Lord, named Lafeu, is proposed to him for a second Wife.
               
                  Bertram eagerly embraces the Proposal, de-claring "he had been violently in Love with

            TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN, EARL OF ORRERY.
            
            
               
                  My LORD,
            
            I Have no other Pretence to the Honour of a Patronage, so illus-trious as that of your Lordship, than

one; the Honour of no Husband has been injured by it; the violated Virgin is the only Person who has been wronged; and her Wrong my Brother is willing to repair, by making her his Wife. I know the Law ordains, that the Ravisher, although willing to marry the injured Maid, shall never-theless die for the Offence he has commit-ted; yet I cannot think, my Lord, that the Makers of this hard Law designed it to be fulfilled in the very Letter of it; Justice over-strained is no longer Justice but Cruelty; the Boundaries of Right and Wrong are so near, that whoever reaches the Extremity of the one, is in Danger of invading the Borders of the other; if the Excess of Virtue be Vice, the Excess of Justice is Cruelty; Mercy is as much the Attribute of Hea-ven as Justice: Here then I beseech you, let them be united; punish my Brother for his Offence, but let that Punishment fall short of Death, and do not let loose upon him all the Rigour of a Law, that was, perhaps, rather made to inspire Terror, than to be exactly executed; let your Wisdom cor-rect it's Severity; you whose delegated Power is our living Law; and punish not by Death a Crime, which may be better repaired by Life."
               The beautiful Epitia ended here; and those Tears which, while she was speaking, she had with Difficulty restrained, now falling fast down her fair Face, Sorrow gave so languish-ing a Sweetness to her Countenance, that Ju-riste stood like one entranced, his Ears eagerly

the young Lady, which was the Cause of his Contempt for Helena."
               
               The Match being concluded on, Lafeu de-sires his intended Son-in-law to give him some Token to send his Daughter; upon which the Count presents him with the Ring he had re-ceived from the supposed Diana.
               
               
                  Lafeu immediately recollects that he had seen that Ring upon Helena's Finger, and the King looking at it, immediately declares that it was the same he had given her at parting.
               
                  Bertram assures them they were mistaken; that the Ring never was Helena's, but thrown to him from a Window in Florence by a Lady who was in Love with him.
               The King, alarmed by these Falshoods, entertains a Suspicion that Bertram had mur-dered his Wife, and sends him to Prison.
               In the mean Time Helena, finding herself with Child, rides post with the Widow and her Daughter to Marseilles, where she had been informed the King was.
               On her Arrival she is told the King is at Roussillon; and meeting with a Gentleman belonging to the Court, who was going there, she delivers a Petition to him, entreating him to present it to the King; the Gentleman pro-mises to do so, and Helena and her Associates follow him to Roussillon.
               
               The Gentleman arrives with the Petition just as the Count is carried off guarded, and the King receiving it reads it aloud; it is signed Diana Capulet; who accuses the Count of having debauched her at Florence under a Promise of Marriage when his Wife died, the

Performance of which she now claims, Helena being dead; and entreats the King would oblige him to do her Justice; the Count is brought again into the King's Prefence, and Diana and her Mother appear to make good the Charge against him; which he denies, and calls his deified Diana a common Strumpet.
               
                  Diana then produces the Ring which he had given Helena, when she met him in her stead; and claims the other which the Count had declared was thrown to him from a Win-dow, and says that she gave it him in Bed; the Count, then acknowledges the Ring was her's; the King, who knew it was the same he had given to Helena, asks her if it was her's; she provokes him by her evasive and contra-dictory Answers, and he orders her to be car-ried to Prison.
               
                  Diana desires her Mother to get Bail for her, and immediately Helena appears, and tells her Lord she had accomplished both the Conditions he had imposed on her; gives him back his Ring, and declares she is with Child; upon which Bertram promises to love her for the future dearly; and the King takes upon himself the Care of providing Diana with a Husband, and paying her Portion.
               
                  Shakespear, in his Comedy of All's Well that Ends Well, has followed pretty exactly the Thread of the Story in the foregoing Novel.
               He has made Use of all the Incidents he found there, and added some of his own, which possibly may not be thought any Proofs

either of his Invention or Judgment, since, at the same Time that they grow out of those he found formed to his Hand, yet they grow like Excrescences, and are equally useless and dis-agreeable.
               The supposed Death of Giletta, as she is called in the Novel, or Helena, as she is named in the Play, is wholly an Invention of Shakespear; yet it produces nothing but a few Ambiguities in the Dialogue, which are far from entertaining, and a base Suspicion of the Count's having murdered her, which he bears with a Tameness unbecoming the Cha-racter of a brave Soldier and a haughty No-bleman.
               The Catastrophe of the Story, though the same in the Play as the Novel, yet is very differently conducted in each: There is more Probability in the Incidents which lead to it in the Novel, and more Contrivance in those of the Play.
               The Reconciliation between the Count and his Lady is very natural and affecting in Boc-cace; in Shakespear it is lost amidst a Croud of perplexing and, in my Opinion, uninte-resting Circumstances.
               The Character of the Heroine is more exalt-ed in the Original than the Copy.
               In Boccace we see her, after her Marriage and the cruel Flight of her Husband, taking the Government of the Province in her own Hands, and behaving with so much Wisdom, Prudence and Magnanimity, as acquired her the Love and Esteem of the People, who all

murmured against the Injustice of their Lord in not being sensible to so much Merit; nor does she endeavour to procure his Affection by a Stratagem, till she has given Proofs that she deserved it.
               
                  Shakespear shews her oppressed with Des-pair at the Absence of the Count, incapable of either Advice or Consolation; giving unne-cessary Pain to the good Countess her Mother-in-law (a Character entirely of his own In-vention) by alarming her with a pretended Design of killing herself, and by some Means or other, which we are not acquainted with, gets the Rector of the Place, to whom she had vowed a Pilgrimage, (which by the Way she does not perform) to confirm the Report of her Death.
               After having accomplished her Design of bedding with her Husband and procuring the Ring, she rides Post to Marseilles with the Widow and her Daughter, on Purpose to ex-pose her beloved Husband to the King's Re-sentment, and the Contempt of all the Courtiers who were present; by making Diana complain to the King of the Count's having debauched her under a Promise of Marriage when his Wife was dead.
               After she has thus exposed the Frailties of her Husband, she has the Cruelty to suffer him to be accused of having murdered her, and in Consequence of that Accusation, seized and imprisoned by the King's Order.
               
                  
The Discovery of her Plot is attended with none of those affecting Circumstances we find in the Original.
               After having made him endure so much Shame and Affliction, she haughtily demands his Affection as a Prize she had lawfully won.
               In Boccace she knÃ©els, she weeps, she per-suades; and if she demands, she demands with Humility.
               In Shakespear she is cruel, artful, and inso-lent, and ready to make Use of the King's Authority to force her Husband to do her Jus-tice.
               The Character of Helena being thus ma-naged in the Play, Shakespear has with Art, made the old Countess (who is an amiable Character) bear Witness to the Vir-tues of Helena; for otherwise we should not have discovered them; we must therefore take her Word for it, that her Daughter-in-law is wise, gentle, prudent and virtuous; for, ex-cept her extreme Cunning, she has nothing striking in her Character; and, except her Perseverance, nothing amiable.
               It is indeed surprizing, that Shakespear, as he has followed so exactly the Copy of Boccace, should deviate from him so much in the Cha-racter of the two principal Persons in his Play, whom, at the same Time, he intends as well as the Novelist to make happy.
               The Count suffers rather more in his Hands than the Lady; in the Novel his greatest Fault is flying from a Woman he had married, and

taking a Resolution never to live with her, but upon Conditions he himself was determined to render impossible.
               Yet this Behaviour admits of much Ex-tenuation: The Woman he had married was forced upon him by the absolute Authority of the King; her Birth was greatly inferior to his; her Person had not attracted his Atten-tion; he had no Inducement to love her; on the contrary, he had great Reason to be of-fended with her for forcing herself, ungenerous-ly as he thought, upon him.
               Her Behaviour indeed after his leaving her merited his Affection; but he was then in love with another Woman, and incapable of listen-ing to the Dictates of his Reason; and when he does yield to acknowledge her For his Wife, he yields to the Force of Conviction; he loves her because he is persuaded she merits it, and accordingly that Love is pure and lasting.
               In Shakespear, when the King offers her to him for a Wife, he refuses her with great Coarseness and many contemptuous Expres-sions; yet upon the King's exerting his Au-thority, meanly submits, and contradicts his former avowed Sentiments.
               After his Marriage, he declares his con-tinued Hatred for her to his Friends, yet con-descends to dissemble unworthily with her to get rid of her.
               In Florence he attempts to corrupt a young Woman of good Family and Reputation, and succeeding as he imagined, openly boasts of it.
               
                  
Upon the News of his Wife's Death, of which he thinks himself the Cause, he expres-ses great Joy; and without taking Leave of the young Woman he supposes he has de-bauched, hastens back to Roussillon. There a Marriage being proposed to him with the Daughter of an old Courtier, he accepts it im-mediately; declaring his Passion for that young Lady, which he durst never reveal, was the Cause of his Hatred to Helena. A very im-probable Tale; because his Quality set him above a Refusal from any Lady; and he is re-presented to be passionately in Love at Flo-rence.
               
               But to go on; when Diana, his Florentine Flame, presents, by the Contrivance of his Wife, a Petition to the King, informing him, that the Count had debauched her by a Promise of Marriage, and then cruelly stole away from her, the Count denies the Charge, and is base enough to defame the Woman he had ruined, calling her a common Creature and infamous Prostitute; and, in the Course of his Exami-nation, invents several ridiculous Lies.
               Upon the Appearance of his Wife, he ac-knowledges all; meanly begs Pardon of both; and promises to love his Wife for the fu-ture dearly.
               It is not easy to conceive a Reason why Shakespear has thus mangled the Characters of Boccace; when, except in a few trifling Cir-cumstances, he has so faithfully followed the Story.
               
                  
It was not necessary to make Helena less amiable, or the Count more wicked in the Play than the Novel, since the Intrigue in both is exactly the same; and certainly he has vio-lated all the Rules of poetical Justice in con-ducting, by a Variety of Incidents, the two principal Persons of the Play to Happiness; when they both (though with some Inequali-ty) merited nothing but Punishment.
            
            
               

               The Thirty-sixth Novel of Bandello. Volume the Second.
               
                  WHEN the Imperial City of Rome was taken and sacked by the united Arms of Spain and Germany, a rich Merchant of Esi, named Ambrogio, was taken Prisoner among the rest of the Inhabitants, This Merchant, by a Wife who was lately dead, had two Children, a Boy and a Girl, both, beyond all Imagination beau-tiful, and so like each other, that when they were both dressed in Boy's or Girl's Cloaths, it was difficult to know the one from the other; so that the Father himself, who for his Diversion often tried the Experiment, was ex-tremely puzzled to distinguish them.
               
                  Ambrogio, who loved them with great Af-fection, spared no Expence in their Educa-tion, but caused them to be taught every Thing that was fit for their Birth and Fortune.
               
                  
At the Time that Rome was sacked, they were about fifteen Years of Age.
               
                  Paolo, so was the Boy called, was taken Prisoner by a certain German, who for his great personal Valour was held in high Esteem by his Nation.
               This Man having taken several other Pri-soners of considerable Rank, drew large Sums for their Ransom; his Share of the Plunder had also been very great, having got a large Quantity of Gold and Silver Plate, many rich Jewels and Cloaths; so that being very well satisfied with his Gain he lest Rome, and went to Naples, taking with him his little Captive Paolo, whom he loved and treated like his own Son.
               The twin Sister of Paolo, who was called Nicuola, fell into the Hands of two Spanish Soldiers, and Fortune was so favourable to her, that upon her telling them she was Daughter to a very rich Man, they treated her with great Respect, in Expectation of receiving a considerable Sum for her Ransom.
               
                  Ambrogio, through the Favour of some Neapolitan Friends who were in the Spanish Troops, avoided Captivity, and had also an Opportunity given him of concealing the great-est Part of his Treasure in a subterraneous Vault, but what remained in his House was pillaged.
               This Loss he bore with great Indifference, Grief for his Children's Captivity, and his Endeavours to find them, taking up all his Thoughts.
               
                  

taking in the Music of her Accents, while his Eyes wandered o'er all the enchanting Beauties of her Form; and that he might the longer in-dulge the Pleasure he felt in hearing and seeing her, he obliged her to repeat her former Argu-ments in her Brother's Favour. Epitia drawing a good Omen from this Willingness in the Go-vernor to hear her Pleas, added many other Persuasions to those she had already used to pro-cure her Brother's Pardon, the Hope she be-gan to entertain giving new Grace and Vigour to her Words.
               
                  Juriste, wholly subdued by the Charms of her Person, and the uncommon Strength of her Understanding, in a Youth so blooming, resolved, if possible, to win her to his Desires, and commit the same Fault with her, for which he had condemned her Brother to die.
               After pausing a little, as if reflecting upon what she had said, Epitia, said he, your Ar-guments have so far prevailed upon me, that, whereas your Brother, according to the Sen-tence of the Law, was to lose his Head to-morrow, I will defer his Execution till I have well considered what you have urged on his Behalf; and if I find your Reasons convincing, I will pardon him; and so much the more willingly will I do it, as I should have been afflicted to have punished him with that Rigour the Law requires. Epitia, full of the pleasing Hope these Words inspired, thanked him with much Submission, telling him, she hoped to find him no less merciful in, giving her Bro-ther Pardon, than he had been kind in post-poning the Execution of the Sentence; and
After a diligent Search he at length found Nicuola, whom he redeemed for five Hundred Ducats, but all the Methods he could use to discover where Paolo, was proving ineffectual, he began to fear he was killed.
               This Apprehension filled him with excessive Affliction, and no longer able to stay in Rome, which continually renewed in his Mind the Remembrance of his lost Son, he returned to Esi, the Place of his Birth, and satisfied with the Riches he possessed, quitted Merchandiz-ing entirely.
               In this City there dwelt a rich Merchant, named Gerard Lanzetti, whose Wife being lately dead, and he through his Intimacy with Ambrogio, having frequent Opportunities of seeing the charming Nicuola, fell violently in Love with her; his own advanced Age, and the extream Youth of Nicuola, did not prevent him from demanding her in Marriage of her Fa-ther, assuring him at the same Time that he would take her without any Portion.
               
                  Ambrogio had too much, Understanding, not to be sensible that so unequal a Match could be productive of no good Consequences; yet to avoid offending the old Lover, he would not give him an absolute Denial, but put him off, by saying he had still Hopes of recover-ing his Son, and could not think of parting with Nicuola till he heard some News of her Brother.
               In the mean Time the Fame of Nicuola's extraordinary Beauty spread through the whole

City of Esi, her Charms was the Subject of ge-neral Conversation. When she went abroad the People gathered in Crouds to gaze on her, and the noblest Youths in the City were continu-ally passing before her Windows, in Hopes of gaining a momentary Sight of her.
               But he who was most assiduous in watch-ing for Opportunities to see her, was a young Gentleman, named Lattantio Puccini, lately come to the Possession of an immense For-tune, by the Death of his Father and Mo-ther.
               The diligent Attendance of this Youth be-fore her Windows, at last attracted the Ob-servation of Nicuola, who being charmed with the Gracefulness of his Person, and flat-tered by his constant Assiduities, shewed her-self frequently at her Window, and with be-witching Smiles and encouraging Glances, endeavoured to assure him that she was pleased with his Passion, which Lattantio perceiving, thought himself the happiest Lover in the World.
               
                  Nicuola, who found an irresistible Sweetness in those new Desires that had taken Possession of her young Bosom, opened her whole Soul to the insinuating Passion, which grew at last to such a Height, that Life was insupportable to her unless she saw him every Day.
               
                  Lattantio, no longer able to content himself with beholding his beautiful Mistress at a Dis-tance only, was endeavouring to procure the Means of speaking to her in private, when some urgent Affairs calling Ambrogio to Rome, where he proposed to stay several Months, he

was unwilling to leave Nicuola to the Care of Servants, and therefore took her to Fabriano, and left her with a Brother of his who had a Wife and Family.
               
                  Nicuola's Departure from Esi was so sud-den and unexpected, that she had no Time to inform her Lover of it, so that he hearing her Father was gone to Rome, supposed he had taken her with him, and remained for some Time extremely disconsolate.
               Absence however producing its usual Ef-fects, so weakened the Idea of Nicuola in his Mind, that an accidental Sight of the fair Catella, Daughter to Gerard Lanzetti, entirely erazed the Remembrance of Nicuola, and he resigned himself wholly up to the Influence of this new Charmer.
               
                  Nicuola on the contrary grieved beyond Measure, at not having been able to inform her Lover of the Place to which she was hurried, passed her Time in Sighs, Tears, and Com-plaints.
               The rigid Austerity of her Uncle, who kept her always in his Sight, made it impos-sible for her to fend a Letter or Message to Lattantio; so that this Restraint adding a fret-ful Impatience to her Grief, she thought every Hour of Absence a thousand Years, and wearied out by continual Anxiety and restless Wishes, she fell into a deep and settled Melan-cholly, which not all the tender Consolations of her Cousins, who thought it was occasion-ed by the Absence of her Father, could re-move.
               
                  
In this Manner she languished several Months, at the End of which her Father left Rome, and passing by Fabriano called for his Daughter, and returned to Esi.
               
               
                  Nicuola left Fabriano with as much Joy as a Soul long tortured in Purgatory feels at quit-ting it for Paradise, feeding her Imagination with the Transports her Return would give her ravished Lover, and enjoying by Antici-pation the exquisite Pleasure of an Interview after so tedious an Absence.
               But on her Arrival at Esi, these pleasing Expectations were all changed to the most racking Jealousy. Report informed her that Lattantio was fallen in Love with Catella, and this cruel News was confirmed by his shocking Indifference towards herself, for he took no more Notice of her than if he had never seen her before.
               
                  Nicuola now abandoned herself entirely to Despair, the Infidelity of Lattantio was ten Times more insupportable than his Absence had been, and so low was the unhappy Beauty reduced, as to endeavour by repeated Letters and Messages to recall herself to his Re-membrance, but those proving all ineffectual, she resolved to die, unless by some Means yet untried, she could recover the Heart of her ungrateful Lattantio.
               
               While Nicuola was thus consuming with an almost hopeless Passion, Ambrogio found it necessary to take another Journey to Rome, and as his Daughter was unwilling to go a second Time to her Uncle's at Fabriano, he

placed her till his Return in a Monastery, where one of her Cousins, named Sister Cam-milla Bissa, was professed.
               This Convent was formely in great Repu-tation for Sanctity, but Nicuola had been there but a short Time before the disorderly Be-haviour of the Nuns gave her great Disgust. Their Conversation, instead of turning upon the holy Lives of the Fathers, their Piety, their Abstinence, and good Works, were in-temperate, loose, and profane: Love was the Business of their Lives; they were not asham-ed to discover their Intrigues to each other, but would even boast of their scandalous Ap-pointments. Instead of Fasting and Prayer, they indulged themselves in the most delicate Repasts and slothful Ease. Instead of wearing Shifts made of Hare-skin next their Bodies, they wore Linen of the highest Prices, adorn-ing themselves with the richest Silks and most expensive Ornaments, heightening their na-tive Beauty with all the Embellishments of Art, and not scrupling even to make Use of Paints, Washes, and Essences, to supply the Defects of Nature.
               Thus adorned, and practising all the allur-ing Artifices of loose Curtezans, they wasted whole Days in Discourses with the young Rakes of the City, who spent the greatest Part of their Time at the Grate of their Con-vent.
               
                  Nicuola, extremely scandalized at the inde-cent Behaviour of the Nuns, often regretted her being placed in their Monastery, and finding no Alleviation of her Griefs amongst

such disagreeable Companions, she gave her-self up to her secret Discontent.
               It happened one Day when Sister Camilla was with her, that some body told that Nun, Lattantio, who often came there on account of Linens and fine Works which he em-ployed those Nuns to make, wanted her at the Grate.
               
                  Camilla went immediately, without taking Notice of Nicoula's Disorder, who no sooner heard the Sound of that Name than her fair Face and Bosom was all overspread with a glowing Red, which in a Moment changed to an ashy Paleness, and though her trembling Limbs were scarce able to support her, yet im-pelled by an eager Desire to see again that much loved Face, and hear the dear Sound of his Voice, she crept to a little Place, where unseen herself, she might both hear and see her faithless Lover.
               This Practice she continued as often as she had any Opportunity, and one Time when she was thus employed, she heard Lattantio complain to Camilla of his ill Fortune in los-ing a Page, who had served him three Years with the utmost Exactness and Fidelity. The Youth he told her was just then dead of a Fever in his House, which gave him great Concern, because he despaired of ever get-ting another as faithful and affectionate as he had been.
               When he was gone, Nicoula reflecting up-on this Incident, it came into her Head to dis-guise herself like a Boy, and serve her Lover

in the quality of a Page, but not knowing how to procure a Habit necessary for her De-sign, she remained for some Time in more Discontent than ever.
               At length she took a Resolution to acquaint her Nurse with this new Scheme which Love had inspired, and if possible engage her Assist-ance in executing it.
               
                  Phillippa, for that was the Name of her Nurse, loved Nicuola with as much Tender-ness as if she had been her own Child, and being desired by Ambrogio when he left Esi, to see his Daughter very often, and to take her when she had an Inclination to her own House; she never failed to visit her at the Con-vent every Day, and the Nuns, with whom Ambrogio had left Directions for that Purpose, permitted Nicuola to go out with her when-ever she desired it.
               To this good Woman Nicuola had entrusted the Secret of her Passion for Lattantio, and flattering herself that her Tenderness for her would make it easy to engage her Assistance in a Scheme that her whole Soul was now bent upon accomplishing, she sent for her one Day, and disclosing her Design, earnestly con-jured her to afford her the Means of exe-cuting it.
               
                  Phillippa, after having for a long Time in vain endeavoured to dissuade her from an Attempt so dangerous to her Reputation, at last consented to her Desire, and taking her to her own House, furnished her with a Suit of

Cloaths, which had belonged to her own Son, a Boy about Nicuola's Age, who died a few Months before, and thus equipt she went to the Street where her Lover lived.
               Chance assisting her Design, brought Lat-tantio to the Door of his House, just as Nicuolo entered the Street, which she observing, as-sumed the Air and Manner of a poor Stran-ger just arrived, gazing at every Thing she saw, and wandering backwards and forwards, as if at a Loss what Place to go to.
               
                  Lattantio struck with the Appearance of so genteel and pretty a Youth, stood still for some Moments observing him, and supposing the poor Boy might possibly want a Service, he made a Sign to him as he passed by to ap-proach.
               
                  Nicuola accordingly came forward, and Lattantio being still more pleased with him on a nearer View, asked him his Name, and whether he was born in Esi.
               
               "My Lord, replied Nicuola, my Name is Romulo, I was born in Rome, and lost my Fa-ther when the City was taken, my Mother died many Years before; I attended a Noble-man as his Page, who was mortally wounded when the City was sacked, and because I wept and lamented his Misfortune, two Spanish Soldiers beat me cruelly, and left me in a miserable Condition."
               "If thou art willing to serve me, said Lattantio, I will take thee to be my Page, and treat thee in such a Manner that thou shalt have no Cause to complain of thy Condi-tion."
               
                  
"My Lord, replied Romulo, I accept your Offer with great Willingness, and desire no other Recompence for my Services than what you shall judge they deserve.
               
                  Romulo accordingly entered that Day into his new Employment, in which he acquitted himself with so much Diligence and Polite-ness, that in a few Days he entirely gained the Favour of his Master, who no longer re-gretted the Loss of his former Page, but thought himself the happiest Man in the World, in the Attendance of so genteel and so faithful a Servant.
               
                  Romulo was now clad in an elegant Livery, and finding his Services agreeable to his Master, and blest with his Sight and Conversation every Day, he would not have changed his Condition for a Place in Paradise.
               It has been said before, that Lattantio was enamoured of Catella, the Daughter of Gerard Lanzetti, Nievola's old Lover.
               This young Lady observing Lattantio pas-sing every Day before her Windows, and by his Looks and Actions endeavouring to shew the Violence of his Passion for her, always looked upon him with great Complacency, though her Heart was as yet wholly insensible of the soft Power of Love, so that Lattantio endeavoured in vain by repeated Letters and Messages to prevail upon her to take some Re-solution in his Favour.
               The artful Fair-one, though she was not disposed to return his Love, yet being pleased

with his Assiduities, would not entirely de-prive him of Hope, but while she carefully avoided coming to any Explanation with him, by her encouraging Looks and Smiles she kept his Hopes alive, and encreased his Desire.
               The extream Avarice of her Father, notwith-standing his great Riches, was the Cause that Catella had all the Opportunities she could wish to indulge her coquet Disposition, for Gerard kept only three Domestics in his House.
               One of these was an old Woman, who hardly ever stirred from the Fire-side, another a Lackey, who always went abroad with him; the third a young Maid-servant, who being bribed by Lattantio, left the young Lady the Liberty of showing herself at the Window as much as she pleased, and every Day brought her a Letter or Message from Lattantio.
               
               The unhappy Lover finding all his Sollici-tations hitherto fruitless, conceived a Design of sending Romulo to intercede for him, hop-ing from a Form and Youth, so engaging, and an Address so insinuating, to induce her to make some Return to his ardent Passion.
               Accordingly giving his Page the necessary Instructions, he ordered him immediately to go to the House of Catella.
               
               Poor Romulo received this Commission with a breaking Heart, and hastily quitting his Master's Presence, ran to his good old Nurse to acquaint her with this new Misfor-tune.
               
                  

added, that she was persuaded, if he would consider what she had said, he would find Rea-sons sufficient to induce him to set her Bro-ther at Liberty. Juriste replied, he would fully consider of it, and would not fail to comply with her Solicitations, provided he could do it without offending Justice.
               
                  Epitia, greatly pleased with her Success, took Leave of the Governor, and went to the Prison to visit her Brother, to whom she rela-ted all that had passed between Juriste and her, and assured him she did not doubt but she should obtain his Pardon.
               The unhappy Youth received this News with Transport, and earnestly begged his Sis-ter to renew her Visit to the Governor, as soon as possible, to know his Resolution, which she promising, they parted, each full of the most pleasing Expectations.
               At the End of three Days she returned to Juriste, and with a graceful Sweetness, de-manded to know what he had resolved concern-ing her Brother. This second Sight of the charming Maid added Fuel to the unlawful Flames of Juriste, who, after gazing on her passionately for some Moments, took her Hand, and thus replied.
               Lovely Epitia, I have not failed to consider all the Arguments you used in your Brother's Favour, and have also diligently sought for others, to enforce them, that I might be able to comply with your Request, but I find all are insufficient, and your Brother is con-demned, not only by a particular, but a uni-versal Law, since he knowingly and wilfully
Oh! Mother, cried he, throwing himself on her Neck all drowned in Tears, I am re-duced to the last Distress, Fortune not con-tented with the Misery I indure in being Wit-ness to the continual Sighs of my perjured Lattantio for Catella, has ordered it so, that I, tortured as I am with Love and Jealousy, must sollicit this happy Rival to yield to the Addresses of my Lover; was there ever, my dear Mother, a Destiny so cruel as mine? If this hated Embassy should be curst with Success, if I should indeed be so wretched to gain my Rival for Lattantio, there will be no other Remedy for my Woes but Death, for it is impossible I should endure Life and behold my Lattantio in the Arms of another.
               Advise me, assist me, my dear Mother, in this deplorable Extremity. Alas! I hoped by my Fidelity and Services, to have made my-self so dear to Lattantio, that when I disco-vered myself to him, the Greatness of my Love would induce him to take Compassion on me, and restore me to the Possession of that Heart that was mine before it was Catella's, but how have I deceived myself! he thinks, he talks of nothing else but Catella; perjured Man, she only is the Object of his Wishes, and I am utterly abandoned. Unhappy me, what shall I do when my Father comes home, if he should discover what I have done, will he not kill me with his own Hands? certainly he will, for what can I say in Excuse for my-self? Help me! oh help me! my dear Mother, tell me what I shall do to avoid the Misery with which I am threatened?
               
                  

                  Phillippa was so moved with the Tears and Complaints of this her dear foster Child, that for some Time she could do nothing but weep. Recovering herself at last, you ask my Advice, my dear Daughter, said she, alas! how often have I given it you in vain, when in discoursing to me of your unhappy Love, I foresaw, and would have prevented the fatal Consequence of it?
               Now then I beseech you pay more regard to my Council; resume your own Dress, and either remain with me or go back to the Monastery, and I will take care your Adven-ture shall never be known to your Father; 'tis possible he may return soon to Esi, and I would not for all the Wealth in the World he should discover you in this Dress, the Conse-quence would be fatal to both you and me.
               Quit then this dangerous Scheme, my dear Nicuola, you see Lattantio is every Day more enamoured of Catella, and you labour in vain to recal his Affection. Why will you hazard your Life and Honour in so hopeless an Enterprize? All the Reward you can ex-pect for this unworthy Servitude is eternal In-famy both to yourself and Family. Nor is this all; your Father may perhaps sacrifice your Life to the Honour of your House, which he will think you have disgraced; how mean, how unworthy is it for one of your Sex, your Birth and Education, to persist in loving one who despises you? to follow one who flies from you? Ah, when I was of your Age I was never guilty of such Weakness, I

was pursued, I did not pursue, I scorned others, but was not scorned myself: Collect your scat-tered Reason, my dear Daughter, quit all Thoughts of this ungrateful Man, and place them on one more worthy your Affection.
               There are many noble Youths in this City who would esteem it a Happiness to gain you for a Wife; but if your Adventure should be discovered, depend upon it, you would find it very difficult to get a Husband; how are you sure Lattantio has not already discovered you, and in Contempt of your Weakness means to take some Opportunity of making you sub-servient to his looser Pleasures? Oh! my Ni-cuola, beware in Time, stay here with me, and shun all the Dangers which threaten your Innocence, your Reputation and your Life."
               
                  Nicuola listened attentively to her Nurse's Discourse; and when she had ended it, stood for some Moments fixed in Thought, then sighing deeply "My dear Mother, said she, I acknowledge that your Advice is just and rea-sonable; but, alas! I am incapable of follow-ing it; since I have done so much, I will see the End happen what will.
               I will go to Catella, and perform my Com-mission, and see whether I am able to prevail with her: Lattantio has yet had only general Answers from her, perhaps she may refuse him: God, who knows my Heart, knows that I only desire to possess Lattantio with Ho-nour: Providence, perhaps, will at length favour my blameless Passion: In the mean time, I will call here every Day, and acquaint

you with every thing that happens to me; and if my Father should come home suddenly, we must provide in the best Manner we can for the Honour of our House; it is, perhaps, as great a Degree of Folly to anticipate Evil by Apprehensions, as to indulge one's Self in a blind Security."
               
                  Romulo then embracing the good old Wo-man, who, silently grieved at the Obstinacy she could not cure, went away, and arrived at Catella's House just as her Father, attended by his Lackey, went out.
               
                  Catella's Maid being at the Door, he in-formed her that he was sent by Lattantio with a Message to her Lady, and desired her to procure him Admittance to her.
               The Girl, shewing him into a ground Par-lour, ran up stairs to her Mistress, and, out of Breath with Joy, cried, "Oh! Madam! Lattantio has sent his beautiful Page, whom you have so often admired, to speak to you."
               Where is he? interrupted Catella impa-tiently; and being told by the Maid that she had ventured to bring him into the House, and that he was waiting for her in the Par-lour; Catella with eager Haste flew to him, and entering the Room, was so astonished with a nearer View of that miraculous Beauty which had charmed her at a Distance, that for some Moments she doubted if she was not in the Presence of an Angel.
               
                  Romulo, making her a low Reverence, de-livered the Message his Master had sent.
               
                  

                  Catella heard him with an inconceivable De-light, not because the Purport of his Words pleased her, but the Sound of that enchanting Voice conveyed an unusual Transport to her Heart; lost in silent Admiration, she stood contemplating the lovely Form before her, while her soft Bosom heaved with, till then, unknown Desires; then breathing an ardent Sigh, and darting a Glance at him, which bet-ter than the most expressive Words ex-plained the tender Passion which had taken a full and absolute Possession of her Soul: "Why, Oh lovely and too dangerous Youth, said she, why do you hazard thus your Life by coming to me on such a Business? Alas! if my Father should return and find you here, the Conse-quence would be fatal both to you and me."
               
                  Romulo, who had well observed her passion-ate Looks, the Changes of her Colour, and the interrupting Sighs that made her Words al-most unintelligible, was persuaded she had entertained a Passion for him, and pleased be-yond Measure at this happy Accident, he as-sumed more Earnestness in his Looks and Voice.
               "It is fit, Madam, said he, that a Servant should in all Things obey the Will of his Master; and dangerous as this Embassy is, yet I undertook it willingly at his Command, who has a Right to all my Obedience; send me not away then I conjure you, Madam, without a favourable Answer; but have

Compassion on my Master, who loves you with the most ardent Passion imaginable."
               
                  Catella suffered him a long Time to solicit her in this Manner, without making him any Answer; when at last, seeing him about to leave her, and vanquished by the irresistible Force of her Passion: "Oh! Heavens! cried she, in a languishing Voice, what you desire of me, charming Youth, I cannot grant; you your-self make it impossible: Alas! by what En-chantment have you thus robbed me of myself?"
               You divert yourself, Madam, at my Ex-pence, replied Romulo; I am no Enchanter, and have practised no Arts upon you; all I want is to prevail upon you to let me carry my Master some agreeable News, who cannot live if you continue thus inexorable; speak, Madam, will you allow me to give him Hopes that you will relent?"
               
                  Catella continuing silent, Romulo, bowing with a discontented Air, moved towards the Door; when she, rouzed by that Action, and no longer able to restrain herself, hastily snatched his Hand, and lifting up her fine Eyes to Heaven, "Oh! cried she, in a faultering Voice, to what am I reduced!" then fixing them with a passionate Look on his Face, "No Man in the World but you, said she, could have made me thus forget what I owe to myself; I love you, charming Youth; I can-not live unless you return my Passion; leave a Servitude so unworthy of you, and be the Lord of me and all I have: I ask not to know your Birth or Fortune; mine can supply the Disadvantages of both; all I require of you is

to quit the Service of Lattantio, whom I can never love, and from this Moment will never give a favourable Glance to, and devote your-self entirely to me."
               
                  Romulo, finding the Business would go on as he wished, after some further Discourse with Catella, promised her to be wholly guided by her Will; assuring her he would always most gratefully acknowledge the Honour and Hap-piness to which she raised him; but at the same Time earnestly entreated her to act with all imaginable Caution in the Affair between them, to prevent its coming to the Know-ledge of Lattantio, who, if he discovers my good Fortune, added he, will not fail to sa-crifice me to his Revenge.
               
                  Catella promising to follow his Advice im-plicitly, Romulo kissed her Hand with a re-spectful Tenderness, assuring her he would see her very soon again, and then went home, where he found his Master waiting for him with an anxious Impatience.
               
                  Romulo then told him, "that he was obliged to wait a long Time before he could procure Admittance to Catella, whom he found highly incensed against him, as well on Account of the severe chiding she had just then suffered from her Father for encouraging his Love, as because she had been informed that he had formerly loved a young Lady of that City very passionately: I used my utmost Endevaours, added Romulo, to remove this Sus-picion from her Mind, but all in vain; and she

dismissed me with an Assurance that she would never see you more."
               
                  Lattantio was extremely afflicted at this sad News; he made his Page repeat several times all the Arguments he had used to Catella in his Favour, and afterwards entreated him to take another Opportunity of speaking to her on the same Subject.
               
                  Romulo promised to do all that lay in his Power for him: The next Day the discon-tented Lattantio passing through the Street where his Mistress lived, in hopes of seeing her, Catella, who was at her Window, no sooner espied him standing opposite to it, than darting a dreadful Frown at him, she hastily withdrew, leaving him overwhelmed with Grief at this Confirmation of his Misfortune.
               The unhappy Lover returned to his House, and shutting himself up in his Chamber with Romulo, began to lament his unfortunate Des-tiny; and being greatly mortified at the con-temptuous Treatment he received from Catel-la, he broke into Invectives and Reproaches against her.
               
                  Romulo seeing his Master moved as he de-sired, began to reason on the fantastic Effects of Love, and pursuing his Discourse, "How often does it happen, said he, that a Man be-comes violently enamoured with a Lady who repays his Passion with Indifference and Dis-dain; and, while he consumes away in hope-less Wishes for her, some unhappy Fair-one languishes in Secret for him."
               
                  
"Your Observation is very just, returned Lattantio, and the same Thing has happened to myself: Some Months ago I was beloved by one of the most beautiful Virgins in this City, who was lately come from Rome; I per-ceived her Passion, and I returned it with the most ardent Affection; but she left the City, and I could not discover to what Place she was gone.
               "In the mean time I happened to see this haughty Beauty, whose Charms took so abso-lute Possession of my Heart, that all Remem-brance of the other was totally erased.
               "The Fair-one I had abandoned returned to Esi, and by Letters expostulated with me on my Infidelity, and tenderly endeavoured to recal my Affection; but I was so wholly en-grossed by my Passion for the ungrateful Ca-tella, that I never took any Notice of her re-peated Complaints."
               "Ah! my Lord, replied Romulo, Love has well revenged your Injuries to Love; Ca-tella by her Disdain of you repays without de-signing it your Infidelity to one who gave you her Heart without Reserve; and it is possible the unhappy Maid you have abandoned wastes her Days in fruitless Wishes, and loves you still though hopeless of ever being beloved again."
               "I know not that, said Lattantio, but it is certain I did once love her with a most ardent Affection, for she was beautiful as an Angel; and Catella, (ah! how Cruelty has altered her) Catella compared to her is all Deformity; to say the Truth, added Lattantio, looking fixed-ly

on Romulo, thy Face has so strong a Re-semblance of the charming Nicuola's, that if thou wert dressed like a Woman I should swear thou wert she herself; thy Age and her's I be-lieve are little different; but I think she is something taller than thee: But why do I thus trifle? Let us speak again of that fair Devil, whom in spite of myself I cannot banish from my Thoughts: Tell me, Romulo, hast thou Courage enough to solicit her once more on my Account?"
               "I will do all I can for you, replied Ro-mulo; and though I was sure of perishing in the Attempt, I would return to her again and plead for you."
               But here we must quit for a while the un-faithful Lover and his disguised Mistress, to relate what happened to Paolo the lost Bro-ther of Nicuola.
               
               His Master, the German, having turned all the rich Moveables he had got at the sacking of Rome into Money, prepared to leave Na-ples, and return to his own Country; when he was suddenly seized with a violent Fever, of which he died in a few Days; having by his Will left Paolo Heir of all his Wealth.
               The fortunate Paolo, now free, and in Pos-session of a large Fortune, having caused his Patron to be honourably interred, took Post for Rome; and there enquiring for his Father, was told, he was gone to Esi, whither he also went.
               But instead of going directly to his Father's House, he alighted at an Inn, and leaving his

committed a Crime, the Punishment of which he knew to be Death; his Guilt therefore ad-mits of no Extenuation; and notwithstanding the earnest Desire I have to please you, I must deliver him up to the Rigour of that Law he has offended: There is indeed one Way, and but one Way, by which you may save your Brother; I love you, charming Epitia, give me Possession of your Person, and I will change your Brother's Sentence to a Punishment less than Death; if you love him you will not scruple to make this small Sacrifice to save his Life, which I am resolved not to spare on any other Terms.
               The fair Face of Epitia, which, at the Be-ginning of this Speech, had been overspread with a languid Paleness, glowed with a rosy Blush at the infamous Conclusion; her Eyes, which had been filled with Tears, now darted forth Rays of mingled Rage and Disdain, and that sweet Voice, that before only uttered the most persuasive Accents, was now changed to a severe and haughty Tone.
               "My Brother's Life, said she, with a noble Fierceness, is indeed very dear to me, but my Honour is far dearer; my Life I would wil-lingly lose to save his, but I will not preserve him with the Loss of my Honour; quit then these unworthy Thoughts, and if you can pardon my Brother, make that Benefit such a Gift, as you without Dishonour may bestow, and I without Infamy receive."
               "I have already told you, replied Juriste, the Terms upon which I will consent to re-lease your Brother, nor ought you to think

Baggage to the Care of his Servants and his Host, he went out alone, and took his Way to the Street where his Father lived; happen-ing to pass by the House of Gerardo Lanzetti, Catella being as usual at her Window, spied him, and supposing him to be Romulo, was greatly surprized at his walking on without taking any Notice of her.
               Her Father not being at home, she ordered her Maid to run after him and tell him she de-sired to speak with him: The Girl did as she was directed; and overtaking Paolo, "Sir, said she, come back immediately; my Lady ex-pects you."
               
                  Paolo, by his Request, and the Girl's fa-miliar Manner of accosting him, supposed he was mistaken for another Person, and resolved within himself to see who this Lady was; and beginning to suspect that she was some Curte-zan; "I will see the End of this Adventure, thought he, and try my Fortune; but the La-dy will be deceived if she thinks to get much Money from me; I will give her but half a Crown at the most."
               At the same Moment that Paolo, conducted by the Maid, arrived at the Door of the House, Gerardo appeared at the Head of the Street: The Girl seeing him, turned hastily to Paolo, "Oh, Sir, said she, there is my Master yonder; walk hereabout, he will not stay long, when he goes out again I will come and let you know."
               
                  Paolo accordingly went away, having first taken good Notice of the House that he might know it again.
               
                  
The Girl, as soon as he was gone, ran in and shut the Door, without being perceived by Gerardo, who, walking leisurely, as old Men do, gave her Time enough; and ar-riving at his House, knocked at the Door, and was let in by the Girl, highly pleased that he had not discovered her.
               
                  Paolo, who staid at a little Distance to ob-serve the old Man, had a Glimpse of Catella, who was standing at a Window, and was charmed to a Degree of Rapture with her Beauty.
               His Thoughts being now wholly engrossed by this fair Unknown, he walked pensively on to his Father's House, end seeing the Windows shut, he enquired of a Shopkeeper where Am-brogio Nanni lived, who told him he had not been seen Esi for several Months past.
               
                  Paolo then returned to his Inn, languishing with an eager Desire to see again the Fair-one that had charmed him: But doubting lest there might be some Danger in the Adventure, he resolved to take one of his Servants with him when he went to see her again.
               In the mean time Ambrogio returned, as has been related, and Gerardo going out of his House met him; and after he had welcomed him to Esi, added, "Ambrogio, you are come in good Time, for I am weary of Delays, and am determined to know at once whether you will give me your Daughter or no?"
               You see, answered Ambrogio, that I am but just arrived; we shall have Leisure enough

to talk of this Affair when I have a little re-covered the Fatigue of my Journey."
               While the two old Men were talking in this Manner, Ambrogio on Horseback, Gerardo on foot, Romulo, who was going to Catella, en-tered the Street, and seeing her Father returned, ran away terrified almost out of her Senses, and went to her Nurse's House.
               "Oh, my dear Mamma, said she, out of Breath with Fear and Haste, my Father is come back; what shall I do?"
               "I will go to him, repied Philippa, and in the mean Time do you put on your own Cloaths, and do not stir from hence till my Return."
               
                  Nicuola, now no longer Romulo, having resumed her own Dress, Philippa went to Ambrogio, who had just dismounted and was entering his House.
               The old Woman saluted him with a chear-ful Countenance, expressing great Joy at his safe Return: Ambrogio having thanked her, enquired for his Daughter.
               "I saw her this very Morning, said the good Nurse, and staid a great while with her in the Convent: How the dear Child will be transported to hear of your Arrival! I had Her frequently at my House during your Absence, sometimes she has staid with me four or five Days together: Truly she is a fine Girl, and works admirably well with her Needle: With your leave, Sir, added she, I will go to the Convent and inform her of your Return, and carry her to my House, where she may stay a

few Days till your's is put in order to receive her."
               
                  Ambrogio consenting, the old Woman took her Leave; but beforeâ–ª she went home, she called at the Convent to settle Matters with sister Camilla, who being a perfect Mistress of Intrigue, she assured Philippa that Nicuola's Absence from the Convent should do her no Hurt, for she would punctually follow all her Directions.
               
                  Philippa, very well satisfied with her Suc-cess, returned home, where Nicuola impatient-ly expected her; she desired her to compose herself for all was now safe; and then related distinctly all that had passed, and told her she was at Liberty to go home the next Day to her Father, or to stay with her for some Days; Nicuola chose the latter; and being now freed from her tormenting Apprehen-sions of being discovered to her Father, she gave a Loose to her Grief on Lattantio's Ac-count; her Passion seemed to gather new Fire from the Difficulties which opposed it, and she resolved to accomplish her Desires or die.
               
                  Philippa combated these Thoughts with all the Reason she was Mistress of; drawing Ar-guments from her despair to induce her to forget Lattantio: "You may be now con-vinced, said she, that Lattantio loves Catella with inexpressible Ardour, and will never think of any other Woman, and in a short Time no Doubt will ask her of her Father in Mar-riage."
               
                  
"Ah! this is what I dread, replied Nicuo-la, weeping; Oh! spiteful Fortune! my Fa-ther's sudden Return has broke all my De-sign; I had conceived Hopes, and with Rea-son too, of putting Lattantio into such Dis-grace with Catella that she would sooner con-sent to marry a Moor than him; but my Fa-ther's unlucky Return has ruined me."
               "Ruined you! interrupted Philippa, say rather that his Return has preserved you from Ruin; if it be true what you have told me concerning Catella's Fondness for you, I fore-see nothing but Shame and Misery can attend the Prosecution of your Designs: Had you gone back to her again, the shameless Wan-ton would by some Means or other have cer-tainly discovered your Sex; and the Conse-quence would be eternal Infamy to you; since being persuaded herself you was the Strumpet of Lattantio, she would persuade the World to believe you so too."
               "That she should believe me the Mistress of Lattantio, replied Nicuola, is what my Wishes aimed at; yet this could not have hurt my Character; for though she discovered my Sex, she had no Opportunity of knowing my Name and Family, and Lattantio would have appeared so treacherous and ungrateful to her, that she would never again have endured him in her Sight."
               
                  Philippa could not be convinced by his false Reasoning of Nicuola's: "Set your Heart at Rest, my Child, said she; for no human Arts can change the Decrees of Providence:

If it be the Will of God that Catella should be the Wife of Lattantio, all your Artifices to prevent this Union will be fruitless: Quit this hopeless Enterprize then, and attend to your real Happiness; you are young, beautiful and rich; your Brother Paolo, poor Youth! is certainly dead, or else, in all this Time, we should have had some Accounts of him; by his Death (God rest his Soul) if you behave well, you will inherit your Father's whole Estate; with this blooming Youth, this beau-tiful Person, and these great Riches, do you imagine you can want the Addresses of many noble Youths, among whom you may fix upon one more lovely than Lattantio?"
               While Philippa and Nicuola wasted the Time in these Kinds of Discourses, Paolo em-ployed his in walking before the Windows of Catella in Hopes of seeing her again; and Lat-tantio, who staid at home impatiently, ex-pecting the Return of his Page, saw the Night approaching with great Surprize, not know-ing to what Cause he should attribute his long Stay.
               He passed the whole Night in the most tor-menting Suspence, fearing some Misfortune had happened to the Youth whom he tenderly loved on Account of his Fidelity, the Sweet-ness of his Manners, and the exact Attention with which he waited on him: Nor was Ca-tella free from a restless Inquietude; she loved Romulo with extreme Ardour, and wished for nothing so much as to be united to him for ever.
               
                  

                  Nicuola, whose ardent Passion rendered her incapable of tasting the soft Blessings of Sleep, spent the Night in sighing and talking of Lat-tantio to her Nurse, whom she would not suffer to take any more Repose than herself.
               The Morning now approached, and Lat-tantio not seeing Romulo appear, rose in great Agitation of Mind, and went about the Town seeking him, and enquiring of every one whom he thought could give him any Intelli-gence of him.
               While he was thus employed, a Shopkeeper who had listened to the Description he gave of the Person and Dress of his lost Page, in-formed him that he saw such a Youth go into the House of an old Woman, named Philip-pa, who lived near the great Church.
               
                  Lattantio, thanking the Man for his In-formation, accepted his Offer of shewing him the House; and knocking at the Door, Phi-lippa opened a Window, and asked him what he wanted? "Good Woman, said Lattantio, with your Leave, I should be glad to speak ten Words to you." "Oh! a hundred, replied Philippa, who knew him, and was almost out of her Wits with Surprize and Joy; then closing the Window, she told Nicuola who was below, and ran down hastily to let him in.
               
                  Lattantio entering the House, was seated by the good Woman in a Place where Nicuola could hear and see all that passed; Lattantio then obliging Philippa to sit near him, thus be-gan: "My good Woman, it may appear

strange to you that I, who have never don you any Favour or Kindness, should come to demand both of you; however, I depend so much upon your good Sense and Benevolence, for which you are in very high Esteem, that I will freely require a Favour of you, and doubt not but to be obliged by your Compliance: Without more Ceremony then, tell me, I be-seech you, for what Cause a young Boy, of a most beautiful Person, drest in white, with a gold Tassel on his Cap, came and secreted himself yesterday in your House? as I am in-formed. You must know, my good Philippa, that this Boy is my Page, for whom I have a great Affection, which he deserves on Account of the Readiness and Fidelity with which he has always obeyed my Commands: I sent him abroad yesterday on some particular Business, and I have never seen him since; and being told, as I said before, that he came here, I am come to desire you will restore him to me again, or tell me at least for what Cause he has left me?"
               "My Son, replied the old Woman, I thank you for your good Opinion of me, and for having deigned to honour my poor Habita-tion with your Presence, an Honour, which indeed I have for some time ardently wished for, having some particular Business to dis-course with you upon; and since you have been pleased to give me this Opportunity, I will make Use of it: But first as to the Ques-tion you asked me concerning your Page; I do assure you I can give you no Account of him;

there is no Boy in my House, nor have I seen such an one as you describe any where here-abouts."
               "You suspect perhaps, interrupted Lattan-tio, that I intend to chastise my Page for not returning home last Night; but upon my Ho-nour I have no such Design; therefore do not conceal the Truth, but tell me for what Rea-son he staid away?"
               "Upon the Faith of a Christian, said Phi-lippa, neither Man or Boy was in this House yesterday; and I am sorry I cannot answer your Demand; I would do it very willingly if I was able."
               
                  Lattantio here breathing a deep Sigh, Phi-lippa looked earnestly on him; "These ar-dent Sighs, said she, and this restless Anxiety on Account of your Page, might persuade any other Person that you loved him too well; but I have often heard that you loved a very beautiful young Lady, so that I cannot easily believe you to be an Enemy to Women."
               "Would to Heaven, replied Lattantio, passionately, that I did not love, I should be the happiest Man in the World: Yes, my good Philippa, you have been truly informed; there is a young Lady in this City whom I love more than my own Soul:" These Words he accompanied with a profound Sigh; Tears at the same Time falling fast from his Eyes, notwithstanding all his Endeavours to restrain them.
               
                  

                  Philippa seeing him so softened, thought she had now an Opportunity to speak more fully to him: "I know well, my Son, said she, in a soothing Accent, that an unfortunate Lover is the most unhappy Being in the World; no Grief is equal to that of loving without being beloved again; this is your Case, and my Soul melts with Compassion for you."
               "How do you know this so certainly? in-terrupted Lattantio," rouzed to Attention by her Words.
               "Enquire not how I came to know it, re-plied she, it is sufficient that I do know you love and are not beloved; and some Months ago you loved a Lady more beautiful than your present Mistress, who returned your Pas-sion with equal Warmth; now at this very Moment I am convinced she languishes and dies for you, ungrateful as you are, and you no longer preserve the least Remembrance of her."
               "I know not that, answered Lattantio, though you may perhaps, for methinks you are perfectly well acquainted with my Affairs; tell me then, I beseech you, by what Means you know the Lady I love at present bestows her Affection on another?"
               "I do not think it necessary to answer that Question, replied Philippa, and you must pardon me if I tell you that you are justly punished by the Disdain of one Lady for your Infidelity and Ingratitude to the other; and happy will it be for you if your Punishment stops here."
               
                  

them hard or dishonourable, since it is possible I may be so charmed with your generous Com-pliance, that I may afterwards make you my Wife."
               "This improbable Hope, replied Epitia, shall not delude me, I will not even bring my Ho-nour into Danger." "Why should you so in-juriously doubt the Efficacy of your own Charms? replied Juriste; there is nothing more likely than that I shall marry you; go then, and consider of my Proposal, and to-morrow I will expect your Answer."
               "There is no Necessity to consider up-on what I have already resolved, said Epi-tia; I will never be your's on those base Terms; but if you set the Liberty of my Bro-ther at the Price of taking you for a Husband, I will marry you on Condition that you release him immediately."
               "I advise you, replied Juriste, to reflect well on my first Proposal; it is in my Power not only to give your Brother Pardon, but to be serviceable also to all your Friends and Re-lations in this Country; my Will here is the Law; and provided you consent to my De-sires, you shall command me in all Things."
               Saying this, he left her; and Epitia finding there was nothing more to be expected from him, oppressed with inconceivable Anguish, went to the Prison, and related to her Brother all that had past between her and the Governor; then melting into Tears, she conjured him to submit patiently to an Evil, which his own ill Fortune, or a sad Necessity, had brought upon him.
               
                  
"Ah! poor Nicuola, added she, raising her Voice, lovely and unfortunate Maid! what hast thou not done to recall the Affection of this unfaithful Man? but all in vain; while he, insensible of thy Charms, and unmoved by those Proofs of unalterable Affection which thou hast given him; follows the haughty Ca-tella with a rejected Love, and meanly sues to one who hates and despises him."
               The Youth, lost in Amazement at hearing all these Particulars from one whom he thought had been an absolute Stranger to him, gazed on her in Silence, not knowing what to answer. While Nicuola stood trembling in her Con-cealment, her Heart beating with anxious Ex-pectation, Fear and Hope taking Possession of her Soul by Turns. Philippa expecting Lat-tantio's Reply, continued silent; and he re-covering a little from his Surprize and Con-fusion, beholding her with an earnest Look thus spoke:
               "Since you are so well acquainted with my Affairs, Philippa, I will speak freely and at large to you."
               "'Tis true, I was once enamoured of Nicuola Nanni, and I have some Reason to think she had also an Affection for me. She left this City with her Father, and I could ne-ver discover to what Place she went, and in the mean Time I saw this fair Devil Catella, the Daughter of Gerardo Lanzetti, whom I have loved passionately ever since; for some Time she received my Addresses favourably, but within these few Days her Behaviour has been

wholly changed; I sent my Page to her with a Message Yesterday, but he never re-turned to bring me an Answer, so I have at once lost all Hopes of gaining the Object of my Affections, and am abandoned by a Ser-vant for whom I had a great Esteem."
               "Had he returned, and informed me that she was resolved to persevere in her unjust Dis-dain, I would have endeavoured to conquer my Passion, and dispose myself to love one to whom my Services would be more accepta-ble; for indeed I am convinced it is a great Degree of Madness to follow one who flies from me, and to love a Woman who is re-solved never to return my Passion."
               "I am glad you are grown so reasonable, my Son, said the good Woman, but pray answer me truly to one Question: If Nicuola, whom you once loved, should continue still to love you in spite of your Infidelity, with a most ardent Affection, what would she deserve from you?"
               "Truly Philippa, replied Lattantio, in that Case she deserves that I should love her more than myself; however it is impossible that she should continue to love me, seeing that I have injured her so basely; not only in abandon-ing her for a Person far less amiable than her-self, but in never returning any Answer to many Letters which she sent me; so that I must appear to her the most ungrateful of Mankind."
               "Notwithstanding all this, replied Philippa, she loves you still, loves you with an unshaken

Constancy; and often in Confidence has she declared to me, that she not only did love you with as much Violence as ever, but would continue to do so while she lived."
               "Oh! it cannot be, interrupted Lattantio, it is impossible, why should you endeavour to deceive me?"
               "I do not deceive you, replied Philippa, I can give you convincing Proofs of what I say, Nicuola loves you more than ever; for you she forsook her Father's House, for you she forgot the Delicacy of her Sex, the Riches she was born to, and the Rank she held in Life, and submitted to do you all the Offices of a menial Servant. Nay, be not astonished, pursued she, for all this the lovely and too loving Nicuola did for you; tell me then, if I make it appear plainly that she has done this, what does she deserve?"
               "You tell me Wonders, replied Lattantio, Things which surpass Belief, yet if they are true, without doubt Nicuola merits all my Love, which I can shew no other Way than by being hers for ever."
               
                  Philippa having brought him to the Point she desired, rose up hastily, and bid the trem-bling Maid, who had heard all that passed, dress herself immediately in her Boy's Cloaths; which being done, she led her into the Room where Lattantio was; her Face all covered with Blushes, and her fine Eyes bent on the Ground in a sweet Confusion.
               "Behold, said Philippa, presenting her to Lattantio, behold your Nicuola, behold your

                  Romulo, your so much desired Page, this is she who despised the whole World for your Sake, and with the utmost Hazard of her Life and Honour waited on you Night and Day."
               
                  Lattantio, lost in Astonishment at what he heard and saw, continued silent and immovable in his Chair, his Eyes fixed on the blushing Maid, who not being able to meet his Looks, hid her averted Face with one of her Hands, while Philippa related her whole Story.
               "Is it possible! cried Lattantio, recovering from his Amazement, can Nicuola have done so much for me? Oh! I should be the most ungrateful, the most detestable of all human Beings, if I could be insensible to such match-less Tenderness and Truth: I will not waste Time in needless Excuses for my past Faults, said he, rising, and approaching Nicuola; but if it be true, that you love and pardon me, from this Moment I vow to be only your's, and will make you my Wife whenever you please."
               
                  Nicuola, who now saw herself arrived to the Summit of all her Wishes, could hardly contain the swelling Transport; and turning her fine Eyes on Lattantio, big with unuttera-ble Joy and Love, she held out her Hand to him, which he received and kissed passionate-ly.
               "My Lord, said she, receive my Faith, which I now give you, with an Assurance that your Will from henceforward shall be always mine; and that the Name and Quality of

Wife shall not hinder me from continuing still to be the most obedient of your Servants."
               
                  Lattantio then taking a Diamond from his own Finger put it on her's, and in the Presence of Philippa solemnly contracted himself to her. That done, he desired her to change her Dress immediately and go home with Philippa to her Father's, whither he intended shortly to fol-low them and demand her of Ambrogio for his Wife.
               In the mean Time Paolo, full of a restless In-quietude, left his Inn as soon as he had dined, and returned to the Street where Catella lived, and standing before her Windows, he anxiously waited for another View of that sprightly Fair-one, whose Charms had already taken an ab-solute Possession of his Heart.
               
                  Catella, who longed as impatiently to see again the lovely Page, no sooner spied Paolo standing in the Street and gazing up at the Window, than supposing him to be Romulo, she hastily called her Maid, "Yonder is Ro-mulo, said she, waiting for Admittance, go and let him in; my Father is now abroad, I can see him with Safety."
               The Girl obeyed her Orders; and Catella running down Stairs with eager Haste met Paolo as he entered, and taking him with her into a Room, "Oh Romulo! Oh my Love! said she, how tedious has the Time appeared since I saw you last! and Oh! how long are you in taking Resolutions! but I will not part with you now, continued she, throwing her Arms about his Neck, and reclining her Face on his Shoulder, with a languishing Sweetness,

No, my lovely Youth, I will not part with you till you have told me whether I am to live or die; for if you will not be mine, certainly Life will be insupportable to me."
               Live, charming Maid, said the transported Paolo, pressing her to his Breast with incon-ceivable Ardour, live and dispose of the Desti-ny of your Romulo."
               
               At this Moment Gerardo, finding his Door open, walked in softly, and hearing a strange Voice in the Parlour, he entered precipitately. At the Sight of a Man with his Daughter, he was going to give Vent to a Rage which might have had fatal Effects, had it not been suddenly allayed by a Sight of Paolo's Face, which was so like Nicuola's that he immediate-ly concluded it was that fair Maid drest in the Habit of a Boy: Possest with this Belief he approched the Lovers, and taking Paolo by the Hand, "Nicuola, said he, it is well thou art not what thou seem'st to be, otherwise I should make both thee and Catella repent this Familiarity:" then turning to his Daughter, he bid her go up to her Chamber and leave Nicuola with him, "for I, added the old Man, smiling, am fitter Company for her than you."
               
                  Catella obeyed and left the Room, much wondering at her Father's Moderation, and at his calling the Youth Nicuola; but being well pleased that she had escaped so easily, she re-solved patiently to wait the Event.
               
                  Paolo, on the other Hand, was full of un-easy Confusion, not knowing how the old

Man would behave to him, seeing that he took him for his Sister.
               "My dear Nicuola, said Gerardo, why are you thus disguised? How comes it that Am-brogio, your Father, suffers you to go about alone in this Manner? Tell me the Truth; what was the Cause of your coming hither? Did you want to see what Sort of a House I keep, and in what State I live? I spoke to your Father two Days ago about giving you to me for a Wife, and I have insisted upon knowing his Resolution soon; I assure you, you will be very happy in having me for a Husband; you shall govern my House, and command me in all Things: Why art thou silent, my Nicuola? Speak, and tell me thy Mind."
               The old Man, at the finishing these Words, made an Offer of kissing the supposed Ni-cuola, who pushing him away roughly, said, "Forbear this Freedom, speak to my Father, and suffer me to depart; I came here by mere Accident, and without any Design."
               "I will let you go since you will have it so, said Gerardo, and will see your Father pre-sently, and finish this Affair."
               
                  Paolo accordingly left him, and went to his Father, who had just given his Consent that Lattantio should marry his Daughter, he having come there to demand her.
               
                  Ambrogio, at the unexpected Sight of his long-lost Son, was ready to expire with Joy; who, after the first Caresses were over, ac-quainted him with his good Fortune, and the great Riches that had been bequeathed to

him. The joyful Father, seeing his Daughter so happily married, and his Son return with so much Wealth, thought himself the happiest Man in the World.
               In the midst of the mutual Congratulations of this happy Family, Gerardo arrived, and was so astonished at the Sight of Paolo and his Sister together, that he doubted whether he was awake or asleep.
               
                  Ambrogio relieved him from his Perplexity, by telling him of the unlooked-for Return of his Son; informing him also that he had mar-ried Nicuola to Lattantio, and then, at Paolo's earnest Entreaty, he desired him to give him his Daughter for a Wife.
               The old Man was at first much affected at the Loss of his intended Bride; but seeing there was no Remedy, he resolved to bear it patiently, and consented that Catella should marry Paolo.
               
               Both these Marriages were performed the same Day, to the great Satisfaction of the four Lovers, who lived ever after with the greatest Harmony imaginable.
            
            
               

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing Novel in his Comedy called Twelfth-Night, or What You Will.
               
               The Fable of TWELFTH-NIGHT, or WHAT YOU WILL.
               
               
                  SEBASTIAN and Viola his Sister, Twins, and so like each other in Person, that in the same Cloaths they could not be distin-guished, embark in a Vessel, (upon what Ac-count, or with what Design we are not in-formed) which is cast away upon the Coast of Illyria.
               
               
                  Viola escapes drowning by the Assistance of the Captain and some of the Mariners, and gets safe to Land; but Sebastian her Brother is suspected to have perished.
               
                  Viola being informed that the Country where she now is, is Illyria, and that it is governed by a Duke, named Orsino, who is in Love, but not beloved again by a noble Lady; she expresses a Wish to be received into her Service.
               
                  
The Captain tells her, the Lady is so af-flicted for the Death of her Brother that she will admit of no Solicitations whatever, not even the Duke's; whereupon, Viola, without further Reflexion, entreats the Captain to provide her with a Disguise, and recommend her as an Eunuch to the Duke, in whose Ser-vice she is very desirous to be placed.
               The Captain consents, and Viola, under the Name of Caesario, soon gains the Duke's Favour and Confidence, who sends him to the Countess Olivia, the Lady he loves, to so-licit her Favour for him.
               
                  Viola is by this Time violently in love with the Duke, yet she executes her Commission very faithfully, and pleads strongly for her Master to the Lady; the disconsolate and rigid Olivia is presently struck with the Beauty of the young Page, and falls downright in Love with him.
               
                  Viola very honestly resists all her Offers; but the Lady will not be repulsed; she sends to entreat he will come to her again; and her Messenger meeting Sebastian, who had also escaped drowning, but was ignorant of his Sister's Fate, deceived by the Resemblance, takes him for Caesario, and entreats him to come to his Lady.
               
                  Sebastian, though much surprized at the Ad-venture, resolves to follow his Fortune; he is introduced to Olivia, who supposing him to be Caesario, urges him to marry her; to which Sebastian, who is immediately charmed with her Beauty, gladly consents.
               
                  
The unhappy Youth burst into a violent Passion of Grief at this cruel and unexpected News, and not able to bear the Terrors of approaching Death, with the most ardent Sup-plications, he begged his Sister not to leave him in that Extremity.
               "Can you, my Epitia, said he, the Tears fast streaming down his pale Cheeks as he spoke, can you endure to have your Brother mangled by the Hands of a base Executioner, dragged to a painful Death at these early Years, divided from you for ever; him who lay in the same Womb with you, whom the same Father begot, bred up in Infancy together, the Partaker of all your childish Sports, and in riper Years the Companion of your Studies? Oh my Sister! are these soft Ties so loosened? Does Nature speak so faintly in you, that you can abandon me to a shameful Death? I have erred I confess; you by your superior Wisdom may correct my Errors; but do not, Oh do not deny me your Assistance in this sad Ex-tremity; has not Juriste told you, that he may possibly make you his Wife; and why should you doubt but he will do so? Have you not Charms sufficient to engage his Heart to you for ever? Nature has made your Person consummately beautiful, and blessed you with an Understanding superior to all your Sex; every female Grace is yours, and every mascu-line Virtue, tempered with a Sweetness which gives you irrestible Attractions. Thus a-dorned, can you, ought you to fear Juriste will not marry you? you, whom the Emperor of the World might be proud to call Wife.â€”
The Duke, some Time after, impatient to see Olivia, comes to her House, attended by Caesario.
               
               
                  Olivia comes out to meet him, and seeing Caesario, supposing him to be the Person she had married, reproaches him with Breach of Promise; what that Promise is we are not told.
               The Duke complains of her Cruelty; she takes little Notice of him, directing her Looks and Words to Caesario; last the Duke being provoked by her Declaration that she could not love him, tells her he will re-venge the Disdain she treats him with upon her Minion his Page, whom he knows she loves.
               
                  Caesario professes his Willingness to die by his Commands, and is following the Duke, but stopped by Olivia, who bids him remem-ber their late Engagements, and declares he is her Husband; the Duke storms; Caesario de-nies the Charge; ahd the Priest is called in by Olivia to witness that he had married them, which he does.
               
                  Caesario persisting in his Denial, many Al-tercations ensue; at last Sebastian, who had been engaged in a Quarrel with Olivia's Uncle, appears; the Company are all astonished at the Resemblance between him and Caesario, who is discovered to be Viola his Sister:
               
                  Olivia acknowledges Sebastian for her Hus-band, and the Duke marries Viola. The rest

is all Episode, and makes up the greatest as well as the best Part of the Play.
               It has hitherto been uncertain whether the Story of Twelfth-Night, or What You Will, was borrowed from any Novel, or an Inven-tion of Shakespear.
               
               Mr. Langbaine, in his Account of the Dra-matic Poets and their Writing, says, that he knows not from whence that Play was taken, but the Resemblance of Sebastian to his Sister Viola was doubtless first borrowed, not only by Shakespear, but all our succeeding Poets, from Plautus, who has made Use of it in several Plays, as Amphitrio, Maenechmi, &amp;c.
               It is really surprising to see the Admirers of Shakespear so solicitous to prove he was very conversant with the Antients; they take all Opportunities to find in his Writings Illusions to them; Imitations of their Thoughts and Expressions! and will not scruple to allow their Favourite to have been guilty of some little Thefts from their Works, provided it will make out his Claim to an Acquaintance with them.
               It is very much to be doubted whether or not he understood the Italian and French Lan-guages, since we find he made Use of Tran-slations from both when he borrowed of their Authors; and still less probable is it that he understood and studied the Greek and Latin Poets, when he, who was so close a Copyer has never imitated them in their chief Beauties,

and seems wholly a Stranger to the Laws of dramatic Poetry, well does the Poet say of him,

                     
                        Shakespear, Fancy's sweetest Child,
                     Warbles his native Wood-Notes wild.
                  
               
               His true Praise seems to be summ'd up in those two Lines; for wild, though harmo-nious, his Strains certainly are; and his mo-dern Admirers injure him greatly, by sup-posing any of those Wood-Notes copied from the Antients; Milton, by calling them native, allows them to have been untaught, and all his own; and in that does Justice to his vast Imagination, which is robbed of great Part of its Merit by supposing it to have received any Assistance from the Antients, whom if he un-derstood, it must be confessed he has profited very little by, since we see not the least Shadow of their Exactness and Regularity in his Works.
               Though it should be granted that Shakespear took the Hint of Sebastian and Viola's Re-semblance from the Maenechmi and Amphitrio of Plautus, yet he might have done that with-out understanding Latin, since there were Translations of both those Plays in his Time; and to his own Invention, had that been the Case, might be attributed almost all the perplex-ing Adventures which the Resemblance of the Brother and Sister gave rise to in the Twelfth-Night, and which are very different from those in the Latin Author.
               
                  
But Shakespear had a much more ample Sup-ply for the Fable of this Comedy in the fore-going Novel, from whence he undoubtedly drew it, and which not only furnished him with the Hint of the Resemblance between Sebastian and Viola, but also with the greatest Part of the Intrigue of the Play.
               
                  Sebastian and Viola in the Play are the same with Paolo and Nicuola in the Novel; both are Twins, and both remarkably like each other.
               
                  Viola is parted from her Brother by a Ship-wreck, and supposes him to be drowned; Nicuola loses her Brother at the sacking of Rome, and for a long Time is ignorant whe-ther he is alive or dead.
               
                  Viola serves the Duke, with whom she is in love, in the Habit of a Page; Nicuola, in the same Disguise, attends Lattantio, who had forsaken her for Catella.
               
               The Duke sends Viola to solicit his Mistress in his Favour; Lattantio commissions Nicuola to plead for him with Catella.
               
               The Duke's Mistress falls in love with Viola, supposing her to be a Man; and Catella, by the like Mistake, is enamoured of Nicuola; and lastly, the two Ladies in the Play, as well as in the Novel, marry their Lovers whom they had waited on in Disguise, and their Bro-thers

wed the Ladies who had been enamour-ed of them.
               Though Shakspear has copied the Novelist in all these Particulars, yet he differs from him in others, which very much lessens the Proba-bility of the Story.
               
                  Sebastian and Viola in the Play are parted by a Shipwreck, and Viola is cast upon the Coast of Illyria; but we are not told with what In-tention this Brother and Sister embarked, or whither their Voyage was bound.
               The Poet had Occasion for them in Illyria, and there they are at the Service of the Au-dience; no Matter if introduced with Propriety or not; we must be contented to take them as we find them: Well; Viola, after giving some Tears to the Memory of her Brother, whom she fears is drowned, is desirous of being re-commended as an Attendant to a Lady with whom the Sovereign of the Country is in love; but being told it would be difficult to procure Admission to her, she all of a sudden takes up an unaccountable Resolution to serve the young Batchelor-Duke in the Habit of a Man; take it in her own Words addressed to the Captain of the wreck'd Vessel:

                     Conceal me what I am; and be my Aid
                     For such Disguise as haply shall become
                     The Form of my Intent: I'll serve this Duke;
                     Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him;
                     It may be worth thy Pains; for I can sing;
                     And speak to him in many Sorts of Music,
                     That will allow me very worth his Service.
                  
               
               
                  
A very natural Scheme this for a beautiful and virtuous young Lady to throw off all at once the Modesty and Reservedness of her Sex, mix among Men, herself disguised like one; and, prest by no Necessity, influenced by no Passion, expose herself to all the dangerous Consequences of so unworthy and shameful a Situation.
               We find this Incident managed with much more Decency in the Novel.
               
                  Nicuola is violently in love with and beloved by Lattantio; and finding that, during a short Absence from him, he became enamoured of Catella, upon hearing he had lost his Page and wanted another, she disguises herself like a Boy, and offers her Service to wait upon him with a View of recalling his Affections by this extraordinary Instance of her Tenderness and Fidelity, and of seizing every Opportunity of traversing his new Passion for Catella.
               
               This Project, though not altogether pru-dent and wise, was far from being inconsistent with the Temper and Circumstances of Ni-cuola, stimulated as she was by Love, Jealousy and Despair, to attempt something extraordi-nary for the Recovery of her Lover.
               But what are Viola's Motives for so rash an Enterprize? She is neither in love with or abandoned by the Duke, and cannot reasonably propose to herself any Advantage by thus hazarding her Virtue and Fame: His Person she had never seen; his Affections she was in-formed

were engaged; what then were her Views and Designs by submitting to be his Attendant?
               
                  Bandello does not even make Nicuola resolve upon such an Expedient till the Design was suggested to her by over-hearing Lattantio la-ment the Loss of his Page and wish for ano-ther.
               But the Novellist is much more careful to preserve Probability in his Narration than the Poet in his Action: The Wonder is that Shakespear should borrow so many Incidents from him, and yet task his Invention to make those Incidents unnatural and absurd.
               The Passion of Olivia, the Duke's Mistress, for the disguised Lady, is attended with Cir-cumstances that make it appear highly impro-bable and ridiculous: She is represented as a noble and virtuous Lady, overwhelmed with Grief for the Death of a beloved Brother; her Grief indeed is of a very extraordinary Na-ture, and inspired her with strange Resolu-tions according to the Report of Valentine, the Duke's Servant, who had been sent by him with a Message to her:
               
                  Duke.
                  How now! what News from her?
               
               
                  Val.
                  So please, my Lord, I might not be admitted;
                  But from her Hand-maid do return this Answer:
                  The Element itself, till seven Years hence,
                  
                     
Shall not behold her Face at ample View;
                  But, like a Cloystress, she will veiled walk,
                  And water once a Day her Chamber round
                  With eye-offending Brine: All this to season
                  A Brother's dead Love, which she would keep fresh
                  And lasting in her sad Remembrance.
               
               This sorrowful Lady, however, makes her first Appearance in the Company of a Jester, with whom she is extremely diverted; and not-withstanding her Vow which we are told of in another Place, hot to admit the Sight or Company of Men, she permits the Duke's Page to approach her, shews him her Face, and bandies Jests and smart Sentences with all the lively Wit of an airy Coquet.
               Then follows her sudden Passion for the sup-posed Youth, which is as suddenly declared, without any of those Emotions that Bashful-ness, Delicacy, and a Desire of preserving the Decorum her Sex and Birth oblige her to ob-serve, must raise in the Mind of a Woman of Honour.
               Had Shakespear, by mixing so much Levity in the Character of Olivia, designed a Satire on the Sex, he would have certainly led us by some Reflexions on the Inconsistency of her Behaviour to have made that Inference; but this is not the Case; for Olivia is every where highly extolled for her Virtues.
               It is his injudicious Conduct of the Fable that gives so much Impropriety to the Man-ners of his Persons, at least in this Instance,

which is the more surprizing, as the Novel furnished him with one much better contrived, and Characters more suitable to the Action.
               
                  Catella acts the same Part in the Novel that Olivia does in the Play; but Catella is a young gay libertine Girl, whose Birth was but mean, and Education neglected; it was not there-fore surprizing that she should so easily fall in Love with a Page, indecently court him, and resolve to marry him, such an inconsiderate Conduct was agreeable to her Character; but in the noble and virtuous Olivia, 'tis unnatu-ral and absurd, and what makes it still more so is, that as Shakespear has ordered the Mat-ter, Olivia is disgracefully repulsed by this Youth, and yet continues her Suit, whereas Cattella meets with a ready Compliance from the supposed Romulo, who sees his Designs on Lattantio likely to succeed by his Mistress's fortunate Passion for him.
               
                  Olivia's taking Sebastian, the Brother of the disguised Viola, for the beautiful Page, and marrying him, is with very little Variation borrowed from Bandello: but Paolo in the Novel is much more naturally introduced than Sebastian in the Play.
               
                  Paolo comes to Esi to seek for his Father and Sister, but we are not acquainted with Sebastian's Motives for going to Illyria; the Poet indeed had Business for him there, and there he lugs him without the least Shadow of

a Reason for it, which is left to the Imaginati-on of the Reader to supply.
               The Behaviour of Lattantio in the Novel is more natural and consistent, than the Duke's in the Play: They both marry the Women that had attended on them disguised, but the Difference of their Stations, Circumstances, and Characters, makes the same Action na-tural in one, which in the other is absurd and ridiculous.
               
                  Lattantio had been in Love with Nicuola, but her Absence, joined to the natural Incon-stancy of Youth, so wild and inconsiderate as his, transferred his Affections from her to Catella; she slights him, and he being inform-ed that his abandoned Nicuola, impelled by the Violence of her Passion for him, had dis-guised herself in Boy's Cloaths, and waited on him as his Page; he repents of his False-hood, and charmed with her Tenderness and Fidelity makes her his Wife.
               This Conduct in Lattantio is very natural, but why should the Duke, a sovereign Prince who so passionately adored Olivia, all at once take a Resolution to marry Viola, a Stranger whom he had never seen in her proper Garb, because she had served him in Disguise; 'tis absurd to suppose he could in a Moment pass from the most extravagant Passion imaginable for Olivia, to one no less extravagant, for a Person, whom till then he had always believed to be a Boy; and 'tis also highly improbable that a great Prince would so suddenly resolve

Oh, my dear Sister, comply with his Proposal; and since you have a reasonable Hope of having your Honour repaired by Marriage, do not, I conjure you, cast away the Life of your Bro-ther."
               The miserable Youth, ending with a new Gush of Tears, cast his Arms round the Neck of his weeping Sister, and holding her fast folded to his sobbing Bosom, would not part from her, till, vanquished by his Tears and her own Affection, which pleaded too strong-ly for him, she promised to consent to what Juriste required, on Condition, that he mar-ried her afterwards, and gave him a free Pardon.
               This being concluded on, she left her Bro-ther, tasting, by Anticipation, the Joy of re-covered Life; and returning the next Day to Juriste, with downcast Looks and faultering Accents, she told him, that the Desire of de-livering her Brother, and the Hope which he had given her of making her his Wife, had induced her to consent to his Desires; but she required a free Pardon for her Brother; that he should not only have his Life, but an Ex-emption from any other Punishment which he had incurred by his Offence.
               
                  Juriste, who now thought himself the hap-piest Man in the World, since he had gained the most lovely and amiable Woman in it to his Will, replied, "that he confirmed the Hope he had formerly given her to marry her, and that if she would pass that Night with him, her Brother should be sent home to her in the Morning."
               
                  

to marry a Girl, who had no other Title to his Favour than an imprudent Passion, which had carried her greatly beyond the Bounds of Decency.
               The Duke's Reasons for this extraordinary Action are far from being convincing.
               
                  Duke to Viola.
               
               
                  Your Master quits you; and for your Service done him,
                  So much against the Metal of your Sex,
                  So far beneath your soft and tender Breeding;
                  (And since you call'd me Master for so long)
                  Here is my Hand, you shall from this Time be
                  Your Master's Mistress.
               
               And as Viola at first had not even Love to plead as an Excuse for her indecent Disguise, she is still less worthy of the Fortune she was raised to.
               There is a great deal of true Comic Hu-mour in the inferior Characters of this Play, which are entirely of the Poet's Invention; the Mistakes Antonio is led into by the Resem-blance of Sebastian and Viola, are no doubt Hints borrowed from the Amphitrio and the Maenechmi of Plautus, for which it is proba-ble he consulted the French, or rather the English Translations of those Comedies extant in his Time; but these Mistakes, however

diverting, take their Rise from a very impro-bable Circumstance.
               
                  Antonio, a Sea Captain, delivers Sebastian from the Fury of the Waves; the Youth be-ing obstinately determined to go to the Court, Antonio, who in a Sea-fight had done great Mischief to the Duke's Galleys, resolves, out of the Violence of his Friendship, to follow him thither, notwithstanding he knew his Life would be in manifest Danger if he was seen in Illyria.
               
               How unaccountably extravagant is this Kind-ness in a Stranger? what more could a long continued Friendship, confirmed by mutual Obligations have produced? But this Play is full of such Absurdities, which might have been avoided, had the Characters as well as the Action been the same with the Novel.
            
            
               

               The History of MACBETH, collected from Holingshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
               
               
                  IN the Reign of Duncan King of Scotland, who, as the Historians say, was a gentle, quiet, and pusillanimous Prince, a Mutiny arose amongst the People of Lochaber; and one Macdowald, a Man greatly esteemed in that Country for his rash Valour, drawing many of his Relations and Friends into a Conspiracy with him, took upon himself to be the chief Captain of the Rebels.
               The great Promises he made to all those that would join him, brought every Day great Numbers from the Western Isles to his Party, which being augmented by the Kernes and Gulloglasses, who voluntarily came out of Ireland to serve him, he in a short Time saw himself at the Head of a formidable Army, with which engaging some of the King's Forces that were sent against him, he gave

them a total Defeat, and took their Com-mander Malcolm Prisoner, whose Head, when the Battle was over, he cut off.
               When the News of this Defeat was brought to the King, he assembled a Council to debate upon what Means they should use to quell the Rebellion.
               
                  Macbeth, who was first Cousin to the King, and of a Disposition as haughty, cruel, and revengful, as Duncan's was mild and peace-able, after secretly accusing the King's Sloth and Effeminacy as the Cause of their Troubles, declared if Banquo and himself were put at the Head of some Forces, and sent against the Rebels, he would engage to give them a compleat Overthrow, and so effectually ex-tirpate them out of that Country, that there should not from henceforth be a single Rebel found in it.
               This Promise he exactly performed, for the Rebels being terrified at his Approach, many of them stole secretly away from their Captain, who with the Remainder being con-strained to fight, were totally routed by Macbeth.
               
               
                  Macdowald in Despair at the ill Success of this last Battle, and finding himself quite abandoned by all the Companions of his Re-volt, fled to a Castle, in which his Wife and Children were inclosed, and knowing that he was not able to defend it long against his Enemies, and that if he surrendered he should

not escape with Life; in a Transport of Grief and Despair, he first killed his Wife and Chil-dren, and then himself.
               
                  Macbeth entering the Castle, in one of the Apartments found the dead Body of Macdowald lying on the Floor, with his Wife and Chil-dren slaughtered beside him, but remitting no Part of his native Cruelty at this dismal Sight, he cut off the Head of Macdowald, and sent it to the King, who then lay at Bertha, com-manding the Body to be hung upon a high Gallows.
               The Inhabitants of the western Isles, who had assisted Macdowald, soliciting for a Par-don, he fined in large Sums, and those he found in Lochaber, who had come thither to bear Arms against the King, he put all to the Sword.
               These Troubles were scarcely appeased, when Advice was brought that Sueno King of Norway was landed in Fife, with a power-ful Army to invade all Scotland.
               
               This News rousing the King from that State of Indolence and Inactivity in which he was buried, he raised Forces with all possible Speed, sharing the Command of them with Banquo and Macbeth.
               
               The Battle, which soon after followed, proved fatal to the Scots, the Norweigens were victorious, and Duncan fled to Bertha; here after spending some Time in feigned Treaties

with his Enemies, he sent Orders to Macbeth, who still kept Part of the routed Army about him, to fall upon the Danes, who he was in-formed were all dissolved in Luxury and Ease.
               
                  Macbeth marched hastily to the Place where the Danes were encamped, and first killing the Watch, made a savage Slaughter of the wretched Danes, whom he found fast asleep in full Security after a drunken Riot. Sueno, with only ten other Persons escaped and fled back to Norway.
               
               In the midst of the Rejoicings the Scots made for this Victory, they were alarmed with an Account that a new Fleet of Danes was ar-rived at Kinghorne, sent thither by Canute, King of England, to revenge the Defeat his Brother Sueno had received.
               To resist these Enemies, which were already landed, and busy in spoiling the Country, Macbeth and Banquo were sent with a sufficient Power, who encountering the Danes, slew Part of them, and drove the rest back to their Ships; those who escaped and got safe aboard their Vessels, with large Sums of Money ob-tained Leave from Macbeth, that such of their Friends as were slain in the last Fight might be buried at St. Colmes Inch.
               
               A short Time after, as Macbeth and Banquo were riding towards Foress, where the King then lay, passing through a Field without any Company, they were met suddenly by three

Women in strange Apparel, resembling Crea-tures of another World, and while they be-held them attentively, much wondering at their uncommon. Appearance, they approached Macbeth, and the first said:
               "All hail Macbeth, Thane of Glammis;" the second "Hail Macbeth Thane of Cawder," and the third, "All hail Macbeth, who here-after shall be King of Scotland."
               
               "What Manner of Women are ye, said Banquo, extremely surprized, who seem so little favourable to me? to my Companion here you not only predict high Honours, but the Kingdom also, whereas to me you pro-mise nothing at all."
               "Yes, said she, who had first spoke, we promise still greater Advantages to thee than him; he shall reign indeed in his own Person, but his End shall be unhappy; nor shall he leave any Issue behind him to succeed to his Crown: As for thee, though thou shalt not be a King, yet thy Descendants for long suc-cessive Ages, shall rule the Kingdom of Scot-land."
               
               No sooner were these Words spoke than they all vanished out of Sight.
               This Accident was thought at first by Macbeth and Banquo, to be some Illusion of the Imagination, so that Banquo would often jest-ingly call Macbeth King of Scotland, and Macbeth in the same Manner call Banquo Fa-ther of many Kings; but afterwards it was the common Opinion, that these Women were either the Weird Sisters, that is,

Goddesses of Destiny, or else Nymphs or Fairies, who by Necromancy had obtained a Knowledge of future Events, because every Thing they predicted came to pass.
               The Thane of Cawder being shortly after condemned at Foriss for high Treason, his Honours, Estates, and Offices, were by the King bestowed on Macbeth.
               
               The first Part of the Prophesy being thus fulfilled, Macbeth revolving the rest in his Mind, began to consider of the Means he should use to gain the Kingdom, but his first Preferment coming unexpected and unsought for, he determined to wait for the Interven-tion of Providence, to raise him to the Dig-nity his Wishes grasped at.
               While he was thus expecting the Comple-tion of the Prophesy, Duncan having two Sons by his Wife, who was Daughter to Seward Earl of Northumberland, declared Malcolm, the eldest, Prince of Cumberland, thereby appointing him his Successor in the Kingdom immediately after his Decease.
               It was provided by the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, that if the succeeding Prince was not of Age to take the Government up-on himself at his Predecessor's Death, his next Kinsman should be raised to the Throne.
               
                  Macbeth therefore seeing his Hopes frustrat-ed by this Disposition of the King's, began to form Schemes for usurping the Kingdom by Force, conceiving himself greatly injured

by Duncan, who by thus raising his Son, though in his Minority, to the Kingdom, took away all his future Claim to it.
               The Words of the Weird Sisters contri-buted also towards confirming him in his De-sign of seizing upon the Crown; and his Wife a haughty ambitious Woman, ardently desirous of being a Queen, never ceased tor-menting him till she had fixed him in his Pur-pose.
               At length, therefore, communicating his In-tentions to his most trusty Friends, among whom Banquo was the Chief, in Confidence of their promised Aid, he murdered the King at Inverness, in the sixth Year of his Reign.
               Then being surrounded with those Persons on whom he most depended, he caused him-self to be proclaimed King, and went imme-diately to Scone, where by general Consent he received the Investiture of the Kingdom ac-cording to the accustomed Manner.
               
                  Malcolm Canmore, and Donald Bane, the two Sons of King Duncan, being apprehen-sive that Macbeth would take away their Lives to secure to himself the Possession of the Kingdom, conveyed themselves secretly out of Scotland.
               
               
                  Malcolm fled into Cumberland, where he remained till Saint Edward, Son of King Etheldred, recovered the Kingdom of England from the Power of the Danes, who received

him into his Protection, and gave him an ho-nourable Entertainment.
               
                  Donald Bane, his Brother, took Refuge in Ireland, and was treated there with great Kindness by the King of that Land.
               
                  Macbeth, after the Departure of these two Princes, endeavoured by great Liberalities to engage the Affection of the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland to his Person, and when he found himself in peaceable Possession of the Kingdom, he set about reforming the Laws, rooting out all the Enormities and Abuses which had crept into the Administration, through the weak and slothful Disposition of Duncan.
               
               He also made many good Laws, and during the Space of ten Years governed the Realm with the utmost Prudence and Justice.
               But this Appearance of Equity and Zeal for the public Good was all counterfeited, and only assumed to gain the Favour of the Peo-ple: Tyrants are always mistrustful, they are in continual Fears that some other Person will rob them of their Power, by the same unjust Means with which they acquired it.
               
                  Macbeth, jealous of some Attempts against him, no longer dissembled his Inclinations, but practised and permitted all Sorts of Cruel-ties, the Words of the three Weird Sisters were continually in his Thoughts.
               They promised him the Kingdom, and he was possessed of it, but they promised it also

                  Epitia, reluctantly consenting, as soon as the Morning dawned, impatient to see her Brother at Liberty, disengaged herself from his Arms, and reminding him of his Promise to marry her, demanded the Liberty of her Brother.
               
                  Juriste told her, she had obliged him so much by her kind Compliance, and his Gra-titude for it was so great, that he would re-lease her Brother immediately, and sent Or-ders for the Jailer to attend him, whom, in the Presence of Epitia, he commanded to send the Brother of that Lady to her House.
               The Jailer departing, Epitia took Leave of the Governor, eager to embrace her beloved Brother, and congratulate him upon the Free-dom she had obtained for him, and returning home, waited for his Arrival with a pleasing Impatience.
               At length the Jailer appeared, followed by two Men, who carried a Bier covered with black Cloth, which the Jailer taking off, dis-covered the Corpse of the unhappy Youth, who had been executed that Morning.
               No Language can express, nor Imagination conceive, the Astonishment, Grief and Hor-ror which filled the whole Soul of Epitia at that cruel Sight; motionless like a Statue she stood at the Side of the Bier, her Eyes firmly fixed on the still bleeding Trunk, and though her Heart was torn with the most agonizing Grief, yet not a Tear or Sigh escaped her.
               After gazing thus for some Moments, she raised her Head, and turning to the Jailer with dry Eyes and composed Voice, "Friend,

to the Posterity of Banquo, and this Prediction might in like Manner be fulfilled.
               To prevent it therefore, he determined to murder Banquo and his Son, and for this Pur-pose he invited them to a Supper at the Palace; as they were returning home, some Murderers whom he had ordered to plant themselves in the Road, seized Banquo and killed him, but Fleance, favoured by the Darkness of the Night, escaped and fled into Wales.
               
               After the Murder of Banquo, Fortune seemed to have forsaken Macbeth, none of his Undertakings prospered; every Man began to tremble for his own Life, and durst not ven-ture to appear before him; all Men were afraid of him, and he was afraid of all Men, so that he continually sought Occasion to put all those Persons to Death of whom he had any Suspicion.
               His Distrust and Cruelty encreasing every Day, his Thirst of Blood was never to be sa-tisfied; the forfeited Estates of the Nobility whom he thus massacred, enabled him to fill his Coffers, and maintain Forces to defend him against the Attempts of his Enemies.
               For the greater Security of his Person, while he was thus exercising the most tyrannic Cruelty against his Subjects, he built a strong Castle upon the Top of a high Hill, called Dunsinnane, situated in Gowry, ten Miles from Perth.
               
               
                  
This Hill was of such a prodigious Height, that any Person standing upon the Top might almost behold all the Countries of Angus, Fife, Stermond, and Tweedale, lying as it were be-neath him.
               The Castle then being founded on the Top of this Hill, the Building of it put the King-dom to great Expence, because the Materials could not be brought up without much Time and Labour.
               But Macbeth being determined to compleat the Work soon, commanded all the Thanes of every Shire throughout the Realm to come and do their Part towards the Building, every Man in his Turn.
               At last it falling to the Turn of Macduffe, Thane of Fife, to build his Part, he sent Workmen with all the necessary Materials, and commanded them to do their Business with the utmost Diligence and Care, that no Occasion of Offence might be given to the King, which might make him resent his not coming in Person as the other Thanes did, for he well knew that Macbeth both feared and suspected him, for which Reason he resolved to keep out of his Way.
               
                  Macbeth coming soon after to see how the Work went on, was greatly enraged to find Macduffe was not there, and from that Time conceived an invincible Hatred against him.
               The Wizards, in whom he greatly confid-ed because of the Completion of the two first Prophesies, had warned him to take heed of

                  Macduffe, who they told him was waiting for some Opportunity to destroy him.
               This Prediction would have determined him to put Macduffe immediately to Death, had not a Witch, whose Predictions had also great Weight with him, assured him he should never be slain by any Man who was born of Woman, nor overcome till Birnam Wood came to the Castle of Dunsinnane.
               
               These soothing Prophesies banished all Fear out of his Mind; he freely indulged the na-tural Cruelty of his Disposition, miserably oppressing his Subjects, and committing all Sorts of Outrages.
               At length Macduffe, being in Fear for his own Life, took a Resolution to fly into Eng-land, hoping to prevail with Malcolm Canmore to claim the Crown of Scotland.
               
               
                  Macbeth, who in every Nobleman's House kept a domestic Spy in his Pay, was soon in-formed of Macduffe's Intention; he therefore came suddenly with an Army into Fife, and besieged the Castle where Macduffe dwelt, ex-pecting to find him therein. The Gates were immediately set open by the Servants, who mistrusted no Danger; but Macbeth, enraged that Macduffe had escaped him (he being al-ready fled to England) commanded his Wife and Children, together with all that were found in the Castle, to be slain.
               
                  Macduffe was safe in the English Court when the News of this shocking Cruelty was

brought him; and adding to the Desire of re-lieving his wretched Country the Hope of his own particular Revenge, he earnestly entreat-ed Prince Malcolm to undertake the Recovery of his Right; he represented to him in the most moving Terms the deplorable Condition into which Scotland was brought, through the in-human Cruelties of Macbeth, and that the People, detesting him for the Slaughters he had committed, as well on the Commons as Nobility, desired nothing more ardently than an Opportunity of shaking off their Yoke.
               
                  Malcolm, whose Soul was filled with Com-passion for the Miseries of his Countrymen, sighed deeply while Macduffe was speaking; which he perceiving, again renewed his In-treaties that he would attempt the Delivery of Scotland, assuring him he would find it no dif-ficult Enterprize, considering the Legality of his Title to the Crown, and the earnest Desire of the People to have some Occasion given them to revenge themselves on their hated Tyrant.
               
                  Malcolm, though he was greatly affected with Macduffe's Discourse, yet doubting whether he was not sent by Macbeth to betray him, he determined to make Tryal of his Sin-cerity before he consented to his Proposal, for which Purpose he spoke to him in this Man-ner.
               "I am truly sorry, Macduffe, for the Miseries under which my unhappy Country has long

groaned, but though my Inclination to relieve it were equal to your Wishes, yet on account of some incurable Vices which are rooted in my Disposition, I am not fit to undertake so great an Enterprize; for first I am so swallow-ed up in immoderate Lust and Sensuality, the abominable Springs of all other Vices, that if I was possessed of the regal Power, the Chastity of none of your Maids and Wives would be safe; and such excessive Intempe-rance would be more insupportable to you than the bloody Tyranny of Macbeth."
               
               "Intemperance, replied Macduffe, is cer-tainly a very great Fault, many noble Kings and Princes have lost both their Kingdoms and Lives by indulging themselves in this Vice; nevertheless there are Women enough in Scotland to serve your Pleasures; follow my Council therefore, and make yourself King; I'll take upon myself the Care of gra-tifying this Passion for Women, in so secret a Manner that your Reputation shall not be hurt by it."
               "But, replied Malcolm, I am also the most avaritious Man in the World, and if I was King of Scotland I should put the greatest Part of the Nobility to Death, that I might pos-sess myself of their Estates."
               "This Fault, said Macduffe, is much worse than the other, for Avarice is the Source of all Evil, a Crime for which most of our Kings have been murdered, yet still I must

continue to advise you to claim the Crown, there are Riches enough in Scotland to satisfy your greedy Desire."
               "I am also, said Malcolm, strongly inclined to Dissimulation and every other Kind of De-ceit, and rejoice in nothing so much as be-traying those who put any Confidence in me; since there is not any Thing then more agreeable to the Character of a Prince, than Constancy, Truth and Justice, and I am wholly abandoned to the contrary Vices, you see how unfit I am to reign; and therefore, since you have found the Means of extenuating all my other Faults, I pray you endeavour to cover them among the rest."
               "Dissimulation, replied Macduffe, is indeed the worst of all, here then I leave thee:" "And oh! unhappy and miserable Scotchmen, added he, that are scourged with so many un-avoidable Calamities! The wicked Tyrant who now without any Right or Title reigns over ye, oppresses ye with the most bloody Cruelty; and this other, who has a lawful Claim to the Crown, is so replete with all the shameful Vices of the English, that he is un-worthy to enjoy it; for, by his own Confes-sion, he is not only avaritious to the last De-gree, but wholly abandoned to the most insa-tiable Lust, and is withal so false a Traitor that no Credit can be given to any Thing he says: Farewell then Scotland for ever; I now look upon myself as a banished Man, without any Hope of Comfort or Relief." Saying this he wept bitterly.
               
                  

                  Malcolm observing he was about to depart, took him by the Hand, and said, "Be comforted Macduff, for I have none of these Vices you la-ment: I have jested with you in this Manner only to try your Sincerity; for many Times hath Macbeth sought by these Means to get me into his Hands, but the more backward I have shewn myself to agree to your Request, the more Diligence shall I use in accomplishing it: Hereupon they embraced, promising to be faithful to each other's Interest, and then con-sulted together how they might best put their Enterprize in Execution.
               
                  Macduff soon after repairing to the Borders or Scotland, secretly dispatched Letters to the Nobles of the Realm, in which he declared, that Malcolm intended to come suddenly into Scotland and claim the Crown; and therefore required them, since that Prince was the true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom, to assist them with all their Power to recover it out of the Hands of the Usurper.
               In the mean time Malcolm so far engaged the Favour of King Edward, that old Seyward, Earl of Northumberland, with ten thousand Men, was appointed to go with him into Scot-land to support him in his Pretensions on that Crown.
               When the News of this intended Invasion was spread abroad in Scotland the Nobles formed themselves into two different Parties,

the one taking Part with Macbeth, the other with Malcolm.
               
               Between these two Factions there frequent-ly happened light Skirmishes; but those that were of Malcolm's Side would not risk the Danger of engaging in a pitched Battle till they were joined by Malcolm, and the English Forces under the Command of Northumberland.
               
               
                  Macbeth, therefore, not thinking himself able to engage the English, retired into Fife, and fortifying a Camp near the Castle of Dun-sinane, determined not to hazard a Battle un-less his Enemies pursued him thither.
               However, some of his Friends advised him either to make a Treaty with Malcolm, or else to fly immediately into the Isles, and take his Treasure with him, to the End that he might be able to engage several of the great Princes of the Realm in his Interest, and re-tain Strangers in his Pay, in whom he might better confide than in his own Subjects, who were every Day abandoning him.
               But he had so firm a Reliance on his Pro-phecies, that he believed he should never be vanquished till Birnam Wood came to Dunsi-nane, nor be slain by any Man that was born of a Woman.
               
                  Malcolm, who had hastily pursued Macbeth, came the Night before the Battle to Birnam Wood, and when his Army had rested there awhile, he commanded every Man to cut down a Branch of a Tree and march with it in his Hand, that thus shaded, they might come

closely, without discovering their Numbers, within View of their Enemies.
               The next Day, when Macbeth beheld them he was greatly astonished, and the Prophecy that had been delivered to him long before coming into his Mind, he doubted not but that it was now fulfilled, since he saw Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane; nevertheless he drew up his Men in Order of Battle, exhorting them to fight valiantly.
               His Enemies, however, had scarcely cast away their Boughs, when Macbeth, perceiving their Numbers, betook himself to Flight.
               
                  Macduff, stimulated with Hatred and an eager Thirst of Revenge, never ceased pur-suing him till he came up with him at Lunfan-nain, and Macbeth seeing him close at his Heels leaped off his Horse, crying aloud, "Thou Traitor, why dost thou thus follow me in vain; since I am not appointed to be slain by any Man that is born of a Woman? But come on then, and receive the Reward thou hast merited for thy Folly." Hereupon he aimed a Blow at him with his Sword, thinking to have killed him; but Macduff suddenly leaping off his Horse, avoided the Stroke, and holding his naked Sword in his Hand thus answered:
               "It is true, Macbeth; and now shalt thy insatiable Cruelty have an End; for I, I am he whom thy Wizards have told thee of, not born of my Mother, but ripped out of her Womb;" then suddenly closing with him, he

slew him on the Place, and cutting off his Head from his Shoulders, fixed it upon a Poll, and brought it to Malcolm.
               
               This was the End of Macbeth, after he had reigned over Scotland seventeen Years: In the Beginning of his Reign he performed many worthy Actions, and made many Laws very useful to the Commonwealth; but afterwards, thro' the Illusion of the Devil, he obliterated the Glory of his good Deeds by the most detestable Cruelty.
            
            
               

said she, tell thy Lord and mine, that such as he has been pleased to send my Brother, I have received him; and that though he has not gratified my Will, yet I am contented, since he has satisfied his own; thus his Will is mine, and I acquiesce in the Justice of the Deed he has performed: Tell him also that for the fu-ture I shall be always ready to devote myself to his Pleasure."
               The Jailer returning to Juriste, recounted all that Epitia had said; adding, that she dis-covered no Sign of Discontent at the horrid Present he brought her.
               
                  Juriste rejoiced extremely at this News, supposing Epitia would give him the peaceable Possession of her Person without claiming the Performance of his Promise to marry her, since she had not resented the Death of her Brother.
               But that unhappy Maid, whose Thoughts were wholly divided between Grief and the Desire of Revenge, no sooner found herself a-lone, than falling in an Extasy of Sorrow on the dead Body of her beloved Brother, she shed a River of Tears upon it, and closely em-bracing it in her Arms, a Thousand Times she cursed the Cruelty of Juriste, and her own weak Simplicity, that e'er she resigned her Honour, she did not oblige him to pay the Price of it by delivering her Brother.â€”Now skrieking aloud, and wildly beating her fair Bosom, that heaved with unutterable Anguish, she contemplated the bleeding Coarse again, and rouzed by that sad Spectacleâ€”"Wilt thou, then Epitia, said she, wilt thou suffer this

               
                  OBSERVATIONS on the Use Shakespear has made of the foregoing History of Macbeth.
               
               The Plan of MACBETH.
               
               
                  MACBETH, a near Kinsman of Dun-can, King of Scotland, having in one Day quelled a Rebellion, and given a total De-feat to the Army of the King of Norway, who invaded Scotland, as he was returning to Court with his Friend Banquo meets three Witches on a barren Heath, the first of whom hails him Thane of Glamis, the second Thane of Cawdor, and the Third with the Title of King hereafter.
               
                  Banquo, offended at their addressing them-selves only to his Friend, desires them to speak likewise to him, upon which they prophesy that he shall be happier than Macbeth, and though he shall not sway a Scepter himself, yet his Descendants shall be Kings; this said they vanished immediately.
               While Macbeth and Banquo are expres-sing their Surprize to each other at this Pro-digy,

some Noblemen sent by the King salute Macbeth with the Title of Thane of Cawdor.
               
               
                  Macbeth, astonished at the Completion of this first Prophecy, entertains a Design of mur-dering the King to make Way for the fulfilling of the second, and artfully sounds the Inclina-tions of Banquo, but finding him fixed in his Loyalty to the King, he forbears to tamper with him.
               The King declaring his Intentions to bestow the Title of Prince of Cumberland on his eldest Son Malcolm, Macbeth alarmed at this, resolves to be sudden in the Execution of his Designs, and by a Letter acquaints his Wife with the Prophecies of the Witches, one of which he tells her had been already accomplished.
               Lady Macbeth, a proud, ambitious, and cruel Woman, urges on her Husband to the Murder of the King, and accordingly Duncan coming to lodge one Night at Macbeth's Castle in Inverness, he is stabbed in his Bed by Mac-beth. The two Sons of Duncan fearing the same Fate fly from Scotland, and Macbeth usurps the Crown.
               Some time after being jealous of the promised Sovereignty to Banquo's Children, he causes Banquo to be murdered, but his Son Fleance, whom he ordered likewise to be dispatched, escapes out of the Hands of the Murderers and saves himself by Flight.
               
                  

                  Macbeth, pressed by uneasy Doubts about his own Security, goes to the three Witches who had predicted his Greatness, to have them resolved; they raise Apparitions who bid him beware of Macduff, the Thane of Fife; but at the same Time assure him that none of Woman born should have Power to hurt him, and that he should never be vanquished till Birnam Wood came to the Hill of Dunsi-nane.
               
               
                  Macbeth, elated with these Promises, sets no Bound is to his Cruelty, and resolves to murder Macduff; but being told he is fled to England, he seizes upon his Castle at Fife, and puts his Wife, his Children, and all that were found within it to the Sword.
               In the mean time Malcolm, the eldest Son of King Duncan, having prevailed upon the King of England, with whom he had taken Refuge, to furnish him with an Army, marches into Scotland accompanied by Macduff who breathes nothing but Revenge against the Ty-rant that had deprived him of his Wife and Children.
               
                  Macbeth hearing of their Approach, and being daily informed of the Desertion of his Officers and Soldiers, fortifies the Castle of Dunsinane, and confiding in the Promises of the Spirits prepares to fight.
               
                  Malcolm, when he comes into Birnam Wood with his Army, commands every Man to cut him down a Bough and carry it before him in

order to conceal their Numbers from the Ene-my; a Centinel of Macbeth's surprized at this strange Appearance, informs him that as he was looking towards Birnam, on a sudden he perceived the Wood to move.
               Macbeth grows furious at this Account, but still relying on the Promise of the last Spirit, "that he should not be hurt by one of Woman born," he goes into the Field, and being met by Macduff, who in Answer to his Boasts of bearing a charmed Life, tells him "he was not born of his Mother, but ripped from her Womb;" he despairs, curses, and being forced to fight, is killed by Macduff: The Conqueror cuts off his Head and carries it to Malcolm, whose Troops having gained a compleat Vic-tory, he is proclaimed King of Scotland.
               
               Lady Macbeth, tormented with horrible Imaginations, deprives herself of Life before the decisive Battle is fought, in which Mac-beth is slain.
               
                  Shakespear has pretty exactly followed the Thread of the History in this Play, which takes in Part of the Life of Duncan and the whole Reign of Macbeth: Some few Varia-tions he has made for the Sake of diversifying his Characters and contracting the Action; as when he shews Banquo unshaken in his Loyalty to his King; though the Historians say he joined with Macbeth in his Conspiracy, and assisted in the murder of Duncan, and making Macbeth defeat the Rebels and subdue the King of Norway in one Day; when, accord-ing to the Historian there was a long Interval

of Time between these two Actions, in which several other Battles were fought.
               It is not to be doubted but Shakespear fol-lowed Hollingshed in the Facts which compose this Play, as well as in many of his other historical Plays. In the History of Macbeth, where he found Hollingshed's Chronicle defi-cient, he probably consulted Bellendon, who translated Boetius in 1541.
               "The Incongruity of all the Passages in which the Thane of Cawdor is mentioned (says the celebrated Author of the Rambler in a Pam-phlet intitled, Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth) is very remarkable; in the second Scene the Thanes of Rosse and An-gus bring the King an Account of the Battle, and inform him that Norway
                  
                     Assisted by that most disloyal Traitor
                     The Thane of Cawdor 'gan a dismal Con-flict.
                  
               
               "It appears that Cawdor was taken Prisoner, for the King says in the same Scene,

                     Go, pronounce his Death,
                     And with his former Title greet Macbeth.
                     
                  
               
               "Yet, though Cawdor was thus taken by Macbeth in Arms against the King, when Macbeth is saluted in the fourth Scene Thane of Cawdor by the Weird Sisters, he asks,

                     

                     How of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives;
                     A prosperous Gentleman.
                  
"And in the next Line considers the Promises that he should be Cawdor and King as equal-ly unlikely to be accomplished.
               "How can Macbeth be ignorant of the State of the Thane of Cawdor whom he has just defeated and taken Prisoner, or call him a prosperous Gentleman, who has forfeited his Title and Life by open Rebellion? Or why should he wonder that the Title of the Rebel whom he has overthrown should be conferred upon him?
               "He cannot be supposed to dissemble his Knowledge of the Condition of Cawdor, be-cause he enquires with all the Ardour of Cu-riosity and the Vehemence of sudden Astonish-ment, and because nobody is present but Ban-quo, who had an equal Part of the Battle and was equally acquainted with Cawdor's Trea-son.
               "However, in the next Scene his Ignorance still continues, and, when Rosse and Angus present him from the King with his new Title, he cries out,

                     The Thane of Cawdor lives:
                     Why do you dress me in his borrow'd Robes?
                  
               
               
                  
"Rosse and Angus who were the Messen-gers that in the second Scene informed the King of the Assistance given by Cawdor to the Invader, having lost, as well as Mac-beth, all Memory of what they had so lately seen and related, make this Answer;

                     Whether he was
                     Combined with Norway, or did line the Re-bels
                     With hidden Help and Vantage, or with both
                     He labour'd in his Country's Wreck, I know not.
                  
"Neither Rosse knew what he had just reported, nor Macbeth what he had just done.
               "This seems not to be one of the Faults that are to be imputed to the Transcribers; since, though the Inconsistency of Rosse and Angus might be removed by supposing that their Names are erroneously inserted, and that only Rosse brought the Account of the Battle, and only Angus was sent to compliment Mac-beth, yet the Forgetfulness of Macbeth cannot be palliated, since what he says could not be spoken by any other.
               
                  "Shakespear, by deviating from History in making Banquo loyal and virtuous, had not on-ly in View the contrasting his Character with Macbeth's, but also a Compliment to King James the First, in whose Reign this Play was written, and was lineally descended from Banquo.
               
               
                  
"The Prophecy of the Witches in the first Act absolutely promises the Crown of Scotland to the Posterity of Banquo: Upon this Prophecy it is that Macbeth causes Banquo to be mur-dered; yet still the Escape of Fleance the Son of Banquo leaves Macbeth Room to suspect that the Kingdom would after his Death de-volve to that Family; his Fears on this Occa-sion are so frequently and strongly inculcated in the Play, that though we have reason to con-clude it is accompplished from the Words of Macbeth at the Sight of the Royal Apparitions with two-fold Balls and treble Scepters.
               
                  Mac.
                  Horrible Sight! Nay, now I see 't is true;
                  For the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
                  And points at them for his.
               
               "Yet it is to be wished that Shakespear had made Use of the prophesying Witches to hint at the Means by which this Change in the Suc-cession was to be made. Thus it is related in Boetius."
               
               
                  "Fleance, after the Murder of his Father, being protected by the Darkness of the Night, and having for some Time concealed himself in Scotland, escaped into Wales, where the Strength of his Judgment and Affability of his Temper recommended him very soon after his Arrival to the Protection and Favour of the Prince of that Country.
               
                  
"Prosperity raised his Ambition to an unpar-donable Height: he abused the Confidence re-posed in him by secretly paying unlawful Ad-dresses to the young Princess, the Daughter of his Benefactor: Those: Addresses proved success-ful; her Father discovered her Pregnancy, and that Fleance was her Paramour; Fleance was put to Death; and the Lady as soon as she was delivered of her Child, which proved to be a Son, and was named Walter, was condemned to pass the rest of her Life in the Character of a mean Domestic. Young Walter, by Order of his enraged Grandfather, was sent to a re-mote Part of Wales to be educated as a Rus-tic.
               "When he had attained his twentieth Year, the Blood which flowed in his Veins inspired him with Sentiments far nobler and more re-fined than those of his usual Companions; he left the Country and threw himself boldly into the Protection of his Grandfather at Court. This noble Resolution was not entirely unsuc-cessful; he was admitted to stay in the Palace, but in a mean and servile Station.
               "One of the Courtiers with whom he had quarrelled, reproached him with the Illegiti-macy of his Birth; Walter was transported with Fury at the Affront, and slew the Person who offered it to him.
               "He was too sensible of his Grandfather's Severity to venture the Effects of it on this Occasion, he fled immediately to Scotland, and implored Protection from his Relations there.
               
                  
"He met with a favourable Reception from them, and was particularly honoured and esteemed by some English Noblemen who were at that Time in the Court of Scotland upon an Embassy to Margaret, who was then Queen of that Nation.
               "He became afterwards General for that Princess in Galloway and the Western Islands; and having gained a compleat Victory over the Rebels of those Parts was made High Se-neschall of the Kingdom, and Lord of several noble Manors, among which was that of Stuart's-Islands.
               
               "He left at his Death a Son, named Allan Stuart, who signalized his Valour on many Occasions against the Saracens in the Holy Land. Alexander his Son succeeded him, and was Founder of Paisley-Abbey. Alexander was followed by his Son Walter, surnamed of Dundonald, a famous General under Alexander the Third. Walter had two Sons, Alexander and Robert who married the Daughter of Ro-bert of Cruxtoun, from which Marriage the Families of Darnley and Lennox are descended.
               
                  "Alexander, the eldest Son of Walter of Dundonald, left two Sons, James and John; James died in his Infancy, and John having espoused the Heiress of Boutell had Issue by her Walter Stuart, who married Margaret, Daughter of King Robert Bruce, after the ci-vil Dissentions of Scotland were entirely ap-peased. By this Princess he had Robert Stuart, afterwards King of Scotland; and from him the Royal Family of Stuart is lineally descend-ed."
               
                  

Traitor, this Barbarian, to triumph in the Spoils of thy ruined Honour, and the Murder of thy unhappy Brother.â€”Shall the complica-ted Villain live to boast of the Deceit he has practised on theeâ€”Ah no, Epitia, since thy Simplicity opened the Way to this Deceiver to accomplish his infamous Designs, let his guilty Passion afford thee the Means of Re-venge. It is true, my dearest Brother, added she, addressing herself with a new Flood of Tears to the pale Coarse, the Death of thy inhuman Murderer will not restore thee to Life, but at least it will be some Alleviation of my Grief, that I did not leave thy Death un-revenged.
               Fixing then upon this Thought, and not doubting but Juriste would shortly send to her, to pass another Night with him, she resolved to comply, and with a Dagger, that she would take secretly along with her, murder him when he was asleep; and if, without Fear of being discovered, she could do it, to cut off his Head, and carrying it to the Tomb of her Bro-ther, there offer it to his Ghost.
               This being resolved upon, she expected a Message from him with much Impatience; but during that Interval, reflecting more ma-turely upon her Scheme, she thought it better to trust the Revenge of her Wrongs to the known Justice of the Emperor, than suffer a second Violation, and hazard likewise the Suc-cess of her Enterprize by undertaking it her-self.
               Being informed that the Emperor was at Villaco, she went thither in a mourning Habit,
This long Account of the Posterity of Banquo will I hope not seem unentertaining to the Admirers of Shakespear, who will thereby see with what Judgment that great Poet has deviated from History in giving Loyalty and Virtue to the Character of this Father of many Kings.
               The Character of Macbeth is drawn after the Historians, yet Shakespear has soften-ed a little some of the most rugged Features; he shews him doubtful and irresolute about the Murder of the King, spurred on by Ambition to commit it, but restrained by his Abhorrence of the Action, and when by the Instigations of his Wife he is prevailed upon to do it, his Mind is afterwards filled with Remorse, and all the uneasy Sensations that attend repentant Guilt.
               The Character Macbeth gives of Duncan in the Play is not inconsistent with that in the History, yet it is not the same; Macbeth speaks only of his Virtues, and his Faults were those Virtues carried to Excess.
               The Instigation used by Lady Macbeth, and the Fire of his Temper are touched upon by Boetius, but improved by Shakespear with all the Force of Words and Propriety of Charac-ter.
               The Wife of Macbeth, says Boetius, in-spired him with Ambition to the utmost of her Power; she was ardently desirous of the royal Title, and was wicked and bold enough to

undertake any Enterprize, and was impetuous in the Prosecution of it.
               She prompted Macbeth to the Murder of the King by the most provoking Expressions, re-proaching him with Cowardice and Sloth, as negligent to receive what Fate had directed to obtain.
               That the Glory of Reigning had inspired many Men to pursue the empty Name of King without the actual Power, even at the Expence of their Lives.
               The machinary Part of this Play is so beau-tifully defended and illustrated by the ingenious Mr. Johnson, in the above-mentioned Pamph-let, that I think I cannot confer a greater Ob-ligation on the Reader than by transcribing those Passages here.
               "In order to make a true Estimate of the Abilities and Merit of a Writer, it is always necessary to examine the Genius of his Age, and the Opinions of his Contemporaries."
               "A Poet who should now make the whole Action of his Tragedy depend upon Enchant-ment, and produce the chief Events by the Assistance of supernatural Agents, would be censured as transgressing the Bounds of Pro-bability; he would be banished from the Theatre to the Nursery, and condemned to write Fairy Tales instead of Tragedies."
               "But a Survey of the Notions that pre-vailed at the Time when this Play was written,

will prove that Shakespear was in no Danger of such Censures, since he only turned the System that was then universally admitted, to his Advantage, and was far from overburthen-ing the Credulity of his Audience."
               "The Reality of Witchcraft or Enchant-ment, which though not strictly the same, are confounded in this Play, has in all Ages and Countries been credited by the common Peo-ple, and in most by the Learned themselves."
               "These Phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently in Proportion, as the Dark-ness of Ignorance has been more gross; but it cannot be shewn, that the brightest Gleams of Knowledge have at any Time been suffici-ent to drive them out of the World."
               "The Time in which this Kind of Cre-dulity was at its Height, seems to have been that of the Holy War, in which the Chris-tians imputed all their Defeats to Enchant-ments or diabolical Opposition, as they as-cribed their Success to the Assistance of their Military Saints. And the learned Mr. W â€” appears to believe (Supplement to the Introduction to Don Quixote) that the first Accounts of Enchantments were brought into this Part of the World by those who re-turned from their Eastern Expeditions."
               "But there is always some Distance be-tween the Birth and Maturity of Folly as of Wickedness: This Opinion had long exist-ed, though perhaps the Application of it had

in no foregoing Age been so frequent, nor the Reception so general.
               
                  Olympiodorus, in Photius's Extracts, tells us of one Libanius, who practised this Kind of military Magic, and having promised to per-form great Things against the Barbarians without Soldiers, was at the Instances of the Empress Placidia put to Death, when he was about to have given Proofs of his Abilities. The Empress shewed some Kindness in her Anger, by cutting him off at a Time so con-venient to his Reputation.
               "But a more remarkable Proof of the An-tiquity of this Notion may be found in St. Chrysostom's Book de Sacerdotis, which exhi-bits a Scene of Enchantments not exceeded by any Romance of the middle Age; he sup-poses a Spectator overlooking a Field of Bat-tle, attended by one that points out all the va-rious Objects of Horror, the Engines of Des-truction, and the Arts of Slaughter. Let him then proceed to shew him in the opposite Ar-mies, Horses flying by Enchantment, armed Men transported through the Air, and every Power and Form of Magic.
               "Whether St. Chrysostom believed that such Performances were really to be seen in a Day of Battle, or only endeavoured to inliven his Description, by adopting the Notions of the Vulgar, it is equally certain that such No-tions were in his Time received, and that therefore they were not imported from the Saracens in a later Age; the Wars with the

                  Saracens however gave Occasion to their Pro-pagation, not only as Bigotry naturally dis-covers Prodigies, but as the Scene of Action was removed to a great Distance, and Dis-tance either of Time or Place is sufficient to reconcile weak Minds to wonderful Rela-tions.
               "The Reformation did not immediately arrive at its Meridian, and though the Day gradually encreased upon us, the Goblins of Witchcraft still continued to hover in the Twilight. In the Time of Queen Elizabeth was the remarkable Trial of the Witches of Warbois, whose Conviction is still commemo-rated in an annual Sermon at Huntingdon. But in the Reign of King James, in which this Tragedy was written, many Circumstan-ces concurred to propagate and confirm this Opinion.
               "The King, who was much celebrated for his Knowledge, had before his Arrival in England not only examined in Person a Woman accused of Witchcraft, but had given a very formal Account of the Practices and Illusions of evil Spirits, the Compacts of Witches, the Ceremonies used by them, the Manner of detecting them, and the Justice of punishing them, in his Dialogues of Daemonologie, written in the Scottish Dialect, and published at Edinburgh.
               
               "This Book was soon after his Accession, reprinted at London, and as the ready Way to

gain King James's Favour was to flatter his Speculations, the System of Daemonologie was immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain Preferment or not to lose it."
               "Thus the Doctrine of Witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated, and as the greatest Part of Mankind have no other Reason for their Opinions than that they are in Fashion, it cannot be doubted but this Persuasion made a rapid Progress, since Vanity and Credulity co-operated in it's Favour, and it had a Ten-dency to free Cowardice from Reproach."
               "The Infection soon reached the Parlia-ment, who, in the first Year of King James, made a Law, by which it was enacted, Ch. 12.

"Thus in the Time of Shakespear was the Doctrine of Witchcraft at once establish-ed by Law and by the Fashion, and it became not only unpolite, but criminal to doubt it, and as Prodigies are always seen in Proportion as they are expected, Witches were every Day discovered, and multiplied so fast in some Places, that Bishop Hall mentions a Village in Lancashire, where their Number was greater than that of the Houses."
               "The Jesuits and Sectaries took Advantage of this universal Error, and endeavoured to promote the Interest of their Parties by pre-tended Cures of Persons afflicted by evil Spi-rits, but they were detected and exposed by the Clergy of the established Church."
               "Upon this general Infatuation Shakespear might be easily allowed to found a Play, espe-cially since he has followed with great Exact-ness such Histories as were then thought true; nor can it be doubted that the Scenes of En-chantment, however they may now be re-diculed, were both by himself and his Audi-ence thought awful and affecting."
               The Note on the first Scene of the fourth Act explains the Nature of the Incantations and diabolical Ceremonies made Use of by the Witches, I shall therefore give the Reader the Pleasure of seeing it here."
               "As this is the chief Scene of Enchant-ment in the Play, it is proper in this Place to observe with how much Judgment Shakespear
                  

has selected all the Circumstances of his in-fernal Ceremonies, and how exactly he has conformed to common Opinions and Tradi-tions."
               Thrice the brinded Cat hath mewed.
               "The usual Form in which familiar Spirits are reported to converse with Witches is that of a Cat. A Witch, who was tried about half a Century before the Time of Shakespear, had a Cat, named Rutterkin, as the Spirit of one of those Witches was Grimalkin, and when any Mischief was to be done she used to bid Rotterkin go and fly; but once when she would have sent Rutterkin to torment a Daughter of the Countess of Rutland, in-stead of going or flying she only cried Mew, from which she discovered that the Lady was out of his Power, the Power of Witches be-ing not universal, but limited as Shakespear has taken Care to inculcate."
               
                  Though his Bark cannot be lost,
                  Yet it shall be Tempest tost.
               
               "The common Afflictions which the Malice of Witches produced was Melancholy, Fits, and Loss of Flesh, which are threatened by one of Shakespear's Witches."
               
                  Weary Sev'nnights nine Times nine
                  Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.
               
               
                  
"It was likewise their Practice to destroy the Cattle of their Neighbours, and the Far-mers have to this Day many Ceremonies to secure their Cows and other Cattle from Witchcraft; but they seem to have been most suspected of Malice against Swine."
               
                  "Shakespear has accordingly made one of his Witches declare that she has been killing Swine, and Doctor Harsenet observes, that about that Time a Sow could not be ill of the Measles, nor a Girl of the Sullens, but some old Woman was charged with Witchcraft."
               
                  Toad, that under the cold Stone,
                  Days and Nights has forty one;
                  Swelter'd Venom sleeping got,
                  Boil thou first i' th' charmed Pot.
               
               "Toads have likewise long lain under the Reproach of being by some Means accessary to Witchcraft, for which Reason Shakespear in the first Scene of this Play calls one of the Spirits Padocke, or Toad, and now takes Care to put a Toad first into the Pot."
               "When Varinus was seized at Tholouse, there was found at his Lodgings ingens Bufo Vitro inclusus, a great Toad shut in a Phial, upon which those who prosecuted him, VinÃ©-ficium exprobabant, charged him I suppose with Witchcraft."

                  For a Charm, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  
"The Propriety of these Ingredients may be known by consulting the Books de Veribus Animalium and de Mirabilibus Mundi, ascrib-ed to Albertus Magnus, in which the Reader, who has Time and Credulity, may discover very wonderful Secrets."
               
                  Finger of birth-strangled Babe,
                  Ditch-deliver'd by a Drab.
               
               "It has been already mentioned in the Law against Witches, that they are supposed to take up dead Bodies to use in Enchantments, which was confessed by the Woman whom King James examined, and who had of a dead Body that was divided in one of their Assem-blies, two Fingers for her Share."
               "It is observable that Shakespear on this great Occasion, which involves the Fate of a King, multiplies all the Circumstances of Horror."
               "The Babe, whose Finger is used, must be strangled in its Birth; the Grease must not be human, but must have dropped from a Gibbet, the Gibbet of a Murderer, and even the Sow whose Blood is used, must have of-fended Nature by devouring her own Farrow. These are Touches of Judgment and Genius."
               
                  And now about the Cauldron sing,
                  Blue Spirits and white,
                  Black Spirits and grey,
                  Mingle, mingle, mingle,
                  You that mingle may,
                  And in a former Part,
                  
                     

the Merit of attempting what has by some unaccountable Neglect been hitherto omitted, though absolutely necessary to a perfect Knowledge of the Abilities of Shakespear.
            
            Among the Powers that must con-duce to constitute a Poet, the first and most valuable is Invention; and of all the Degrees of Invention, the high-est seems to be that which is able to produce a Series of Events. It is easy when the Thread of a Story is once drawn to diversify it with Variety of Colours; and when a Train of Action is presented to the Mind, a little Ac-quaintance with Life will supply Cir-cumstances and Reflexions, and a lit-tle Knowledge of Books, furnish Pa-rallels and Illustrations. To tell over again a Story that has been told already,

and having easily procured an Audience of him; she threw herself at his Feet all in Tears. "Most sacred Sir, said she, the base Ingratitude, and unequaled Cruelty the Go-vernor of Inspruck has used towards me, has brought me hither to implore your Justice"â€”Then bending her Eyes to the Ground, her fair Face being dyed with Blushes, she told the Emperor, "that her Brother having been condemned to die; to save his Life, she had consented to the loose Desires of Juriste, who had made her Com-pliance the only Condition of his Pardon; but that after he had robbed her of her Honour, instead of repairing it, as he had promised by Marriage, or freeing her Brother, which he had sworn to do, he sent his dead Body to her the next Morning."
               
                  Epitia could not recal this mournful Image to her Mind, without relapsing into so vio-lent an Agony of Grief, that the Emperor, and the Lords who were about him, were at once struck with Astonishment, Horror and Compassion.
               
                  Maximine, though he was greatly moved, having given one Ear to Epitia, reserved the other for Juriste, and raising the fair Mourn-er from the Ground; he dismiss'd her to re-pose, and sent immediate Orders to Juriste, to appear before him, charging his Messenger, and all who had heard Epitia's Complaint, upon pain of his Displeasure, not to give any intimation of it to Juriste.
               
               The cruel Governor, who had not the least Suspicion of what had happened, obeyed the
Weird Sisters Hand in Hand,
                  Thus do go about, about
                  Thrice to mine, and thrice to thine,
                  And thrice again to make up nine.
               
               "These two Passages I have brought to-gether, because they both seem subject to the Objection of too much Levity for the Solem-nity of Enchantment, and may both be shewn by one Quotation from Camden's Account of Ireland, to be founded upon a Practice really observed by the uncivilized Natives of that Country.
               "When any one gets a Fall, says the In-former of Camden, he starts up, and turning three Times to the Right, digs a Hole in the Earth; for they imagine that there is a Spirit in the Ground; and if he falls sick in two or three Days, they send one of their Women that is skilled in that Way to the Place, where he says, I call thee from the East, West, North, and South, from the Groves, the Woods, the Rivers and the Fens, from the Fairies, Red, Black, and White.
               "There was likewise a Book written before the Time of Shakespear, describing among other Properties the Colours of Spirits."
               The learned and ingenious Mr. Upton, in his critical Observations on Shakespear has dis-covered a Beauty that has escaped all his other Commentators: "The Apparitions, he says, who are introduced paltering with Macbeth in

a double Sense, and leading him on according to the common Notions of diabolical Oracles to his Confusion, are themselves symbolical Representations of what shall happen to him.
               "The armed Head who bids him beware of Macduff, represents symbolically Macbeth's Head cut off, and brought to Malcolm by Macduff. The bloody Child, who assures him that none of Woman born should have Power to hurt him, is Macduff untimely rip-ped from his Mother's Womb. And the Child with a Crown on his Head and a Bough in his Hand, who tells him he shall never be vanquished till Bernam Wood comes to Dun-sinane, is the royal Malcolm, who ordered his Soldiers to hew them down a Bough, and bear it before them till they come to Dunsi-nane."
               
               
                  Shakespear seems to have committed a great Oversight, in making Macbeth, after he found himself deceived in the Prophecy relating to Birnam Wood, so absolutely rely upon the other, which he had good Reason to fear might be equally fallacious. When the Mes-senger tells him he saw Birnam Wood begin to move, and that it was coming towards Dun-sinane, he falls into a Transport of Grief and Despair, and owns he doubts the Equivocation of the Fiend, yet carries his Reflexions no farther than the present Ciscumstance. Though it might naturally be expected from the Con-viction of the Falsehood of one Prophecy, upon which he had built such solid Hopes, that the

Truth of another, which promised him Se-curity from all Men of Women born, might be justly suspected by him; yet in the Field of Battle, a little after that, we find him as full of Confidence on that Prediction as if his Spirits had never deceived him.
               
                  What's he,
                  That was not born of Woman? such a one
                  Am I to fear or none,
               
               And again.
               
                  Swords I smile at; Weapons laugh to Scorn,
                  Brandish'd by Man that's of a Woman born.
               
               And when challenged to Fight by Macduff, he says:

                     Thou losest Labour;
                     As easy mayst thou the intrenchant Air
                     With thy keen Sword impress, as make me bleed:
                     Let fall thy Blade on vulnerable Crests,
                     I bear a charmed Life, which must not yield
                     To one of Woman born,
                  
               
               How inconsistent is this vain-glorious Boast-ing and extravagant Confidence in a Man, who having been just before told that the Wood was moving, makes the following Speech?
               
                  

                  If thou speak'st false,
                  Upon the next Tree shalt thou hang alive,
                  'Till Famine cling thee: If thy Speech be sooth
                  I care not, if thou dost for me as much.â€”
                  I pull in Resolution, and begin
                  To doubt th' Equivocation of the Fiend,
                  That lies like Truth. Fear not, 'till Bernam Wood
                  Comes to Dunsinane.â€”And now a Wood
                  Comes towards Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
                  If this, which he avouches, does appear,
                  There is not flying hence, nor tarrying here;
                  I'gin to be a weary of the Sun;
                  And wish the State o' th' World were now un-done
                  Ring the alarum Bell; blow Wind, come Wrack,
                  At least, we'll die with Harness on our Back.
               
               But this Play has fewer Faults of this Kind than any other of Shakespear's, and is deserved-ly allowed to be a most beautiful Piece.

Emperor's Commands, with great Chearful-ness, and presenting himself before him, with all the Assurance of conscious Innocence; de-sired to know his sacred Pleasure.
               You shall be informed of it immediately, said the Emperor; then turning to some of his Attendants, he ordered them to bring Epitia into his Presence.
               
                  Juriste when he beheld the unhappy Lady, whom he had so cruelly injured, now subdued for the first Time by the Stings of Consci-ence, his vital Spirits almost forsook him, an ashy Paleness overspread his Face, and an uni-versal trembling seized his whole Body.
               The Emperor, who beheld these Signs of Guilt, no longer doubted, but that all Epitia had said was true, and beholding him with a furious Look; "Listen, said he, to the Com-plaint this Lady has to make against you;" and then commanded Epitia to relate her Story.
               She accordingly obeyed, and recounted all the Particulars of Juriste's Baseness and Ingra-titude to her, and concluding with Tears, demanded Justice of the Emperor.
               
                  Juriste hearing this Accusation, approached Epitia, and thinking to sooth her said, "Could I ever have believed Epitia, that you whom I have so much loved, would come hither to accuse me to the Emperor".
               
                  Maximine, who would not suffer him to use any of his Arts to soften the injur'd Maid, interrupted him sternly. "This is no Time for you to play the passionate Lover, said he,

Answer, to the Crimes she charges you with."
               
                  Juriste finding that his Blandishments would be of no Use to him, left Epitia, and replied, "'Tis true, my Lord, I condemned the Brother of this Lady to lose his Head, for having forcibly violated the Chastity of a Virgin; this being the Punishment the Law had provided for his Crime; and in causing the Sentence to be executed upon him, I only obeyed your Majesty's Commands, who above all Things recommended to me, the strict Ad-ministration of Justice, which must have been injured, had I suffer'd him to remain alive."
               "Since the Preservation of Justice, was the Motive of your Actions, replied Epitia, why did you violate it, by promising to grant my Brother his Pardon, and by means of that Promise, which you did not perform, and the Hope you had given me of taking me for your Wife, which you have neglected to fulfil, rob me of my Honour; if my Brother for a small Crime merited all the Severity of the Law, surely you deserve it, whose Guilt is much greater than his was."
               
                  Juriste having nothing to say, in excuse of himself, continued silentâ€”"And is it thus then, said the Emperor to Juriste, that thou dost administer Justice? but never more shall it be in thy Power to act such Villanies, nor shalt thou escape unpunished, depend upon it."
               
                  Juriste now began to implore Mercy, while Epitia on the other Hand, loudly de-manded Justiceâ€”The Emperor, who had well considered the Simplicity of Epitia, and the

great Wickedness of Juriste, cast in his Mind, how he might repair her Honour, and yet do Justice on the Governor, and after some Pause, he declared his Intention of oblig-ing Juriste to marry her.
               The Lady however refused to consent to it, saying, "she could not think of becoming the Wife of a Man, who had murdered her Brother, and betrayed her;" but the Emperor would be obeyed, and they were immediately married.
               
                  Juriste now thought he had no more to fear, when the Emperor, permitting Epitia to re-tire to her Lodgings, turned towards Juriste, who still remained in his Presence, and said. "Two Crimes hast thou committed, each of which deserves a most rigorous Punishment. First, by a most detestable Artifice violating the Chastity of an unhappy Girl, and Second-ly, breaking the Faith, thou hadst given her, by putting her Brother to death. For the first Injury I have provided some Recompence by making thee marry the deceived Lady, and for the Second, I condemn thee to lose thy Head, as thou madest her Brother to lose his."
               The Horror of Juriste at this unexpected Sentence may be easier imagined, than de-scribed; it was in vain for him to sue for Mercy, the Emperor was determined, and he was led away to Prison, in order to be executed the next Morning.
               
                  Juriste, no longer hoping for Pardon, dis-posed himself to meet patiently the Death he had so well deserved; when Epitia, being in-formed of the Sentence that had been past up-on

him, hastened to Court, and intreating another Audience of the Emperor; as soon as she was admitted to his Presence, throwing herself at his Feet, she said, "Most sacred Sir, the Cruelty and Injustice Juriste used towards me, moved me to come to your Majesty, and implore Justice for the double Wrong I receiv-ed from him, which you have most graciously granted; my violated Chastity you have re-paired by obliging him to marry me, and for my Broth
                     â€¢
                  r's Death, contrary to his solemn Promise, you have condemned him to die. As a violated Maid, as an injured Sister, I then demanded Justice on him, but as his Wife I now implore Mercy. Consider, sacred Sir, this new Obligation was imposed on me, by you; his Death was before due to my Wrongs, his Life is now become my Care, through the Engagements you have made me enter into with him. To repair my Honour you gave him to me for a Husband; if he dies by my Accusation, your Majesty's most generous Intentions will not avail me, since the World will brand my Name with Infamy and Cru-elty! Oh! let not the Sword of Justice, thus miserably cut the Knot you have so lately tied; grant my Husband's Life to my Prayers; let your Clemency equal your Justice, and in the Use of both be like the Immortals themselves."
               
                  Epitia ended here, and the Emperor, seiz'd with Astonishment and Admiration at the Greatness of her Mind, thought he could do no less than grant the Demand she so gene-rously made, and sending immediately for

                  Juriste, he said, "Wickedly as thou hast acted towards this Lady, yet such is her Generosity and unequalled Goodness, that she has solicited no less ardently for thy Pardon than if thou hadst never offended her; I give thee Life then; but know thou owest that Life to her Me-diation; and if she is willing, since I have made thee her Husband, to live with thee as such, I consent it should be so; but take care to treat her with the utmost Tenderness; for if I ever hear that thou dost otherwise, thou shalt feel the severest Effects of my Dis-pleasure."
               The Emperor, in finishing these Words, took Epitia's Hand and gave it to Juriste, who, with his Wife, falling at Maximine's Feet, gave him Thanks for the great Good-ness he had shewn them; and Juriste reflect-ing on the unmerited Kindness and Generosi-ty of Epitia, ever loved her with the most ar-dent Affection, and lived happily with her to the End of his Days.
            
            
               

               From the foregoing Story of Juriste and Epitia, Shakespear took the Plot of Measure for Measure. The Incidents in the Novel are fewer, and less complex than in the Play, but the Subject in both is the same.
               The Fable of MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
               
               
                  VINCENTIO, Duke of Vienna, being resolved to have some severe Edicts re-vived, which had lain dormant during a great Number of Years, declares his Intention of leaving his Dominions for some Time; and makes Angelo, a Nobleman of severe Life, and austere Manners, his Deputy in his Absence. â€”The Duke, instead of leaving Vienna, pri-vately repaires to a Convent; and there disclose-ing his Design of spying into the Actions of the Deputy and People to a Friar, he engages him to procure a Habit of the Order for his Disguise, and instruct him, as he phrases it, How he may formally in Person bear like a true Friar.
               
               
                  Angelo begins his Administration by causing Claudio, a young Gentleman, who had de-luded a Virgin, to be arrested on an old Act, by which it was provided, that the Man who committed such a Crime should die; and ac-cordingly he signs a Warrant for his Execu-tion.
               
                  

                  Escalus, an old Lord, very much beloved by the Duke, and who had been deputed by him to bear a subordinate Part in the Admi-nistration, endeavours to prevail with Angelo to soften the Severity of this Sentence, but in vain.
               The Sister of Claudio, a beautiful young Virgin, and a Novice in the Convent of St. Clair, solicits Angelo for her Brother's Par-don; he denies her; but afterwards being enamoured of her Beauty, promises to grant her Request, upon Condition, she gives him Possession of her Person.
               
                  Isabella with great Disdain, refuses to pur-chase her Brother's Life upon these shameful Terms; goes to the Prison and acquaints Claudio with her ill Success; the Youth, fond of Life, intreats her to save him, and comply with the Deputy's Request: She, after re-proaching him severely for his Baseness, quits him in great Rage.
               The Duke, who, in the Disguise of a Friar, was come to visit and exhort the Prisoners, having overheard all that had passed between Isabella and her Brother, intreats some private Discourse with her; she consents; and he in-forms her, that Angelo, some Years before, had been contracted in Marriage to a young Lady, named Mariana, whom he forsook be-cause her Fortune was lost at Sea; and to co-lour his Perfidy, gave out, that he left her on Account of her Unchastity; he then advises her, in order to save her Brother's Life, to go to the Deputy, and tell him that she will con-sent to the Conditions he had proposed to her;

and in the mean Time he would prevail upon Mariana, who still loved Angelo, secretly to supply her Place, by which Means her Bro-ther's Pardon would be obtained, without the Loss of her Honour.
               This Contrivance is put in Execution; but Angelo, notwithstanding his Promise to the contrary, sends a new Order to the Provost of the City for the Execution of Claudio, and commands him to bring him his Head.
               The Duke, wholly taken up with the Af-fairs of the Prison, is soon informed of this un-expected Event; he prevails with the Provost to delay the Execution of Claudio, and to de-ceive the Deputy, by cutting off the Head of a Pirate who died in the Prison, and present-ing it to him for Claudio's.
               
                  Isabella coming to the Prison, to know if her Brother's Pardon had been sent, is told by the disguised Duke, that he was executed early that Morning, pursuant to a new Order from Angelo.
               
               
                  Isabella raves and threatens; the counterfeit Friar advises her to complain of Angelo to the Duke, who was that Day expected to return to Vienna.
               
               The Duke then, shifting his Dress, enters the City, attended by Angelo and Escalus, whom he had commanded to meet him; Isabella fal-ling on her Knees, demands Justice on An-gelo, for having deluded her of her Honour, under Pretence of saving her Brother's Life, and afterwards causing him to be executed.
               The Friar, who was in the Secret, de-clares, Isabella spoke an Untruth, for that she was absolutely unviolated by Angelo.
               
               
                  

                  Mariana is then introduced, who, in an enigmatical Manner, declares herself to have been the Person who supplied Isabella's Place with Angelo, and claims him for her Husband. Angelo denies all.
               The Duke then slipping away, resumes the Habit of a Friar, and, after some Reflexions on the Government, he is ordered by the De-puty to be carried to Prison, and being seized by a wild young Fellow, his Hood falls off, and he is discovered to be the Duke.
               
                  Angelo hereupon confesses his Crime; the Duke orders him to marry Mariana immediate-ly, which being done, he condemns him to Death. At the Intercession of Mariana and Isabella he is pardoned; and the Duke, charmed with the Virtue and Beauty of Isabella, offers himself to her for a Husband.
               The rest is all Episode, made up of the ex-travagant Behaviour of a wild Rake, the Blun-ders of a drunken Clown, and the Absurdi-ties of an ignorant Constable.
               There are a greater Diversity of Characters, and more Intrigues in the Fable of the Play, than the Novel of Cinthio; yet I think, where-ever Shakespear has invented, he is greatly be-low the Novelist; since the Incidents he has added, are neither necessary nor probable.
               The Story of Juriste and Epitia, of itself, afforded a very affecting Fable for a Play; it is only faulty in the Catastrophe. The Reader, who cannot but be extremely enraged at the Deceit and Cruelty of Juriste, and very de-sirous of his meeting with a Punishment due to his Crime, is greatly disappointed, to find him

and to tell it better than the first Author is no rare Qualification; but to strike out the first Hints of a new Fable; hence to introduce a Set of Charac-ters so diversified in their several Pas-sions and Interests, that from the clashing of this Variety may result many necessary Incidents; to make these Incidents surprising, and yet natural, so as to delight the Imagina-tion without shocking the Judgment of a Reader; and finally, to wind up the whole in a pleasing Catastrophe produced by those very Means which seem most likely to oppose and pre-vent it, is the utmost Effort of the human Mind.
            To discover how few of those Writers, who profess to recount ima-ginary Adventures, have been able to

in the End, not only pardoned, but made hap-py in the Possession of the beautiful Epitia.
               
               
                  Shakespear, though he has altered and ad-ded a good deal, yet has not mended the Mo-ral; for he also shews Vice not only pardoned, but left in Tranquility.
               The cruel, the vicious and hypocritical An-gelo, marries a fair and virtuous Woman, who tenderly loved him, and is restored to the Fa-vour of his Prince.
               I said before, that the Story of Juriste and Epitia afforded an affecting Subject for a Play; and it is to be wished, since Shakespear thought proper to found one upon it, that he had left the Fable simple and entire as it was, without loading it with useless Incidents, unnecessary Characters, and absurd and improbable In-trigue.
               Thus it would have stood by keeping close to the Novelist: A young Gentleman, van-quished by the Force of a too violent Passion, ravishes a Virgin, whom he is afterwards willing to marry, but is seiz'd and condemn'd to die for his Crime; his Sister a beautiful Maid, who tenderly loves the unfortunate Youth, solicits the rigid Governor for his Pardon, which he refuses, unless she sacrifices her Honour to him. The Lady rejects his Pro-posal with Disdain, but subdued by the affect-ing Tears and Prayers of a Brother, whose Life is dearer to her than her own, she reluct-antly consents to the Governor's Proposal, on Condition, that he should give her Borther a free Pardon, and repair her Honour hereaf-ter by Marriage.
               
                  
The Governor binds himself by Oath, to perform both these Conditions; which Oath he breaks; after the unfortunate Lady had paid the Price of them, and sends an immediate Order for her Brother's Execution.
               The Lady in the violence of her Grief and Rage, resolves to murder him with her own Hands, but reflecting that she could not take this Revenge on him, without subjecting herself to a second Violation, she complains of her Wrongs to her Sovereign, and demands Ju-stice on the impious Perpetrator of them.
               The Emperor in order to repair her Honour, obliges the perfidious Governor to marry her, and then commands him to be led to Exe-cution, which she by an exalted Piece of Generosity opposes, and as his Wife kneels and solicits ardently for his Pardon; which the Emperor at last grants.
               Here the Novelist should be dropt, and the Catastrophe, according to poetical Justice, might be thus wound up.
               The Lady having performed her Duty, in saving the Life of a Man, who, however un-worthy, was still her Husband, should de-vote herself to a Cloister, for the remainder of her Life; and the wretched Juriste, de-prived of his Dignity, in Disgrace with his Prince, and the Object of Universal Contempt and Hatred, to compleat his Miseries, he should feel all his former Violence of Passion for Epitia renewed, and falling into an Excess of Grief, for her Loss, (since the Practice is allowed by Christian Authors) stab himself in De pair.
               
                  
The Fable thus manag'd, takes in as great a Variety of Incidents, as with Propriety can be introduced in a Play, and those Incidents naturally rising out of one another, and all de-pendant on the principal Subject of the Dra-ma, forms that Unity of Action, which the Laws of Criticism require.
               This Fable also, would not be destitute of a Moral, which as Shakespear has managed it, is wholly wanting. The fatal Consequence of an irregular Passion in Claudio; the Danger of endeavouring to procure Good by indirect Means in Isabella, and the Punishment of lawless Tyranny in the Governor, convey Instruction equally useful and just.
               Since the Fable in Cinthio is so much bet-ter contrived than that of Measure for Mea-sure, on which it is founded, the Poet sure cannot be defended, for having altered it so much for the worse; and it would be but a poor Excuse, for his want of Judgment, to say, that had he followed the Novelist closer, his Play would have been a Tragedy, and to make a Comedy, he was under a Necessity of winding up the Catastrophe as he has done.
               The comic Part of Measure for Measure is all Episode, and has no Dependance on the principal Subject, which even as Shakespear has managed it, has none of the Requisites of Comedy, great and flagrant Crimes, such as those of Angelo, in Measure for Measure, are properly the Subject of Tragedy, the Design of which is to shew the fatal Consequences of those Crimes, and the Punishment that never fails to attend them. The light Fol-lies

of a Lucio, may be exposed, ridiculed and corrected in Comedy.
               That Shakespear made a wrong Choice of his Subject, since he was resolved to torture it into a Comedy, appears by the low Con-trivance, absurd Intrigue, and improbable In-cidents, he was obliged to introduce, in order to bring about three or four Weddings, in-stead of one good Beheading, which was the Consequence naturally expected.
               The Duke, who it must be confess'd, has an excellent plotting Brain, gives it out that he is going incog. to Poland, upon weighty Affairs of State, and substitutes Angelo to govern till his Return; to Friar Thomas his Confidant, however, he imparts his true Design, which is, in his Absence, to have some severe Laws revived, that had been long disused: Methinks this Conduct is very unworthy of a good Prince; if he thought it fit and necessary to revive those Laws, why does he commit that to another, which it was his Duty to perform?
               The Friar's Answer is very pertinent.
               
                  It rested in your Grace
                  T' unloose this tied-up Justice when you pleas'd;
                  And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
                  Than in Lord Angelo.
                  
               
               The Duke replies,
I do fear, too dreadful.
               
               
                  
In short, the poor Duke is afraid to exert his own Authority, by enforcing those Laws, notwithstanding he thinks them absolutely ne-cessary, and therefore as he says,

                     I have on Angelo imposed the Office;
                     Who may in the Ambush of my Name strike home.
                  
               
               However, in Fact, it is the Duke who strikes in the Ambush of Angelo's Name; for it is he who causes Angelo to put those severe Laws in Execution, while he skulks in Con-cealment to observe how they are received; if ill, Angelo must stand the Consequence; if well he will enjoy the Merit of it. And in order to discover how Things are carried on in the Commonwealth, he makes the Friar procure him a Habit of the Order, and thus disguised, where does he go? Why, to the common Jail, among the condemned Male-factors. His Speculations are wholly confined to this Scene.
               Here, entirely taken up with the Affairs of the Prisoners, his Highness ambles backwards and forwards, from the Prison to Maria-na's House, fetching and carrying Messages, contriving how to elude those very Laws he had been so desirous of having executed; cor-rupting one of the principal of his Magistrates, and teaching him how to deceive his Delegate in Power.
               How comes it to pass, that the Duke is so well acquainted with the Story of Mariana,
                  

to whom Angelo was betrothed, but abandoned by him on Account of the Loss of her For-tune? She speaks of the Duke as of a Person she had been long acquainted with.
               
                  Mariana.
                  Here comes a Man of Comfort, whose Advice
                  Hath often still'd my brawling Discontent.
               
               Yet this could only happen while he assumed the Character of a Friar, which 
                     â€¢â€¢
                  s but for two or three Days at most; he 
                     â€¢â€¢
                  d not pos-sibly have been acquainted with 
                     
                   Story be-fore; if he had, the Character of Angelo would have been also known to him; and conse-quently it was unnecessary to make him his Deputy, in order to try him further, which was one of his Reasons, as he tells Friar Tho-mas, for concealing himself.
               If it is granted, that the Duke could not know Mariana's Affair before his Disguise; what Opportunities had he of learning it afterwards? For, notwithstanding what Mariana says, which intimates a long Acquaintance, it is certain it could have been but a very short one; some extraordinary Accident therefore must have brought her Story to his Knowledge, which we find was known to no one else; for Angelo's Reputation for Sanctity was very high, and that could not have been, if his Wrongs to Mariana were publickly known.
               But why does not the Poet acquaint us with this extraordinary Accident, which happens so conveniently for his Purpose? If he is account-able

to our Eyes for what he makes us see, is he not also accountable to our Judgment for what he would have us believe? But, in short, without all this Jumble of Inconsistencies, the Comedy would have been a downright Tra-gedy; for Claudio's Head must have been cut off, if Isabella had not consented to redeem him; and the Duke would have wanted a Wise, if such a convenient Person as Mariana had not been introduced to supply her Place, and save her Honour.
               As the Character of the Duke is absurd and ridiculousâ–ª that of Angelo is inconsistent to the last Degree; his Baseness to Mariana, his wicked Attempts on the Chastity of Isabella, his villainous Breach of Promise, and Cruelty to Claudio, prove him to be a very bad Man, long practised in Wickedness; yet when he finds himself struck with the Beauty of Isa-bella, he starts at the Temptation; reasons on his Frailty; asks Assistance from Heaven to overcome it; resolves against it, and seems car-ried away by the Violence of his Passion, to commit what his better Judgment abhors.
               Are these the Manners of a sanctified Hy-pocrite, such as Angelo is represented to be? Are they not rather those of a good Man, overcome by a powerful Temptation? That Angelo was not a good Man, appears by his base Treatment of Mariana; for certainly no-thing can be viler than to break his Contract with a Woman of Merit, because she had ac-cidentally become poor; and, to excuse his own Conduct, load the unfortunate Innocent with base Aspersions, and add Infamy to her

other Miseries: Yet this is the Man, who, when attacked by a Temptation, kneels, prays, expostulates with himself, and, while he scarce yields in Thought to do wrong, his Mind feels all the Remorse which attends ac-tual Guilt.
               It must be confessed indeed, that Angelo is a very extraordinary Hypocrite, and thinks in a Manner quite contrary from all others of his Order; for they, as it is natural, are more concerned for the Consequences of their Crimes, than the Crimes themselves, whereas he is only troubled about the Crime, and wholly regardless of the Consequences.
               The Character of Isabella in the Play seems to be an Improvement upon that of Epitia in the Novel; for Isabella absolutely refuses, and persists in her Refusal, to give up her Honour to save her Brother's Life; whereas Epitia, overcome by her own Tenderness of Nature, and the affecting Prayers of the unhappy Youth, yields to what her Soul abhors, to redeem him from a shameful Death. It is certain however, that Isabella is a mere Vixen in her Virtue; how she rates her wretched Brother, who gently urges her to save him!
               
                  Isabella,
                  Oh, you Beast!
                  Oh faithless Coward! Oh dishonest Wretch!
                  Wilt thou be made a Man out of my Vice?
                  Is't not a Kind of Incest, to take Life
                  From thine own Sister's Shame? What shou'd I think?
                  Heav'n grant my Mother play'd my Father fair:
                  
                     
For such a warp'd Slip of Wilderness
                  Ne'er issued from his Blood. Take my De-fiance;
                  Die; perish: Might my only bending down
                  Reprieve thee from thy Fate, it should pro-ceed.
                  I'll pray a thousand Prayers for thy Death;
                  No Word to save thee.
               
               
                  Claudio.
                  Nay, hear me, Isabella.
                  
               
               
                  Isabella.
                  Oh fie! fie! fie!
                  Thy Sin's not accidental, but a Trade;
                  Mercy to thee wou'd prove itself a Bawd:
                  'Tis best that thou dy'st quickly.
               
               Is this the Language of a modest tender Maid; one who had devoted herself to a re-ligious Life, and was remarkable for an exalt-ed Understanding, and unaffected Piety in the earliest Bloom of Life?
               From her Character, her Profession, and Degree of Relation to the unhappy Youth, one might have expected mild Expostulations, wise Reasonings, and gentle Rebukes; his De-sire of Life, though purchased by Methods he could not approve, was a natural Frailty, which a Sister might have pitied and excused, and have made use of her superior Understand-ing to reason down his Fears, recal nobler Ideas to his Mind, teach him what was due to her Honour and his own, and reconcile him to his approaching Death, by Arguments drawn from that Religion and Virtue of which she made so high a Profession; but that Tor-rent

of abusive Language, those coarse and un-womanly Reflexions on the Virtue of her Mother, her exulting Cruelty to the dying Youth, are the Manners of an affected Prude, outragious in her seeming Virtue; not of a pious, innocent and tender Maid.
               I cannot see the Use of all that jug-gling and Ambiguity at the winding up of the Catastrophe; Isabella comes and demands Justice of the Duke for the Wrongs she had received from his Deputy, declaring she had sacrificed her Innocence to save her Brother's Life, whom Angelo had, notwithstanding his Promise to the contrary, caused to be exe-cuted.
               Upon the Duke's telling her, that he be-lieved her Accusation to be false, she goes away in Discontent, without saying a Word more: Is this natural? Is it probable, that Isabella would thus publicly bring a false Impu-tation on her Honour, and, though innocent and unstained, suffer the World to believe her violated?â€”She knows not that the honest Friar who advised her to this extraordinary Action, is the Duke to whom she is speaking; she knows not how the Matter will be cleared up.
               She who rather chose to let her Brother die by the Hands of an Executioner, than sacri-fice her Virtue to save his Life, takes unde-served Shame to herself in public, without procuring the Revenge she seeks after.
               
                  Mariana's evasive Deposition; Friar Pe-ter's enigmatical Accusation of Isabella;

produce any Thing by their own Ima-gination would require too much of that Time, which your Lordship employs in nobler Studies. Of all the Novels and Romances that Wit or Idleness, Vanity or Indigence, have pushed into the World, there are very few, of which the End can-not be conjectured from the Begin-ning; or where the Authors have done more, than to transpose the In-cidents of other Tales, or strip the Circumstances from one Event for the Decoration of another.
            In the Examination of a Poet's Character it is therefore first to be en-quired what Degree of Invention has been exerted by him. With this View I have very diligently read the Works of Shakespear, and now presume to

the Duke's winding Behaviour; what does it all serve for? but to perplex and embroil plain Facts, and make up a Riddle without a Solution.
               The Reader can easily discover how the Plot will be unravelled at last; but the unne-cessary Intricacies in unravelling it, still remain to be accounted for.
               The Play sets out with the Moral in the Title, Measure for Measure; but how is this made out? the Duke speaking of Angelo to Isabella, says,

                     â€”â€”â€”but as a Judge,
                     Being doubly Criminal, in Violation
                     Of sacred Chastity, and of Promise Breach,
                     Thereon dependant for your Brother's Life,
                     The very Mercy of the Law cries out
                     Most audible, even from his proper Tongue.
                     An Angelo for Claudio; Death for Death.
                     Haste still pays Haste, and Leisure answers Leisure;
                     Like doth quit Like, and Measure still for Measure.
                     
                  
               
               Thus it should have been, according to the Duke's own Judgment to have made it Mea-sure for Measure; but when Angelo was par-doned, and restored to Favour, how then was it Measure for Measure?
               
               The Case is not altered, because Claudio was not put to death, and Isabella not violated; it was not through Angelo's Repentance, that both these Things did not happen; a Woman

he was engaged to, supplied the Place of Isabella, and the Head of another Man, was presented to him instead of Claudio's. Angelo therefore was intentionally guilty of pervert-ing Justice, debauching a Virgin, and break-ing his Promise, in putting her Brother to death, whose Life she had bought by that Sa-crifice. Isabella when pleading for him, says,

                     My Brother had but Justice,
                     In that he did the Thing for which he dy'd;
                     For Angelo, his Act did not o'ertake his bad Intent,
                     And must be buried but as an Intent,
                     That perish'd by the Way; Thoughts are no Subjects:
                     Intents, but meerly Thoughts.
                  
               
               This is strange Reasoning of Isabella; her Brother deserved Death, she says, because he did the Thing for which he died; he intended to do it, and his doing it was the Consequence of his Intention.
               
                  Angelo likewise intended to debauch her, and murder her Brother, and he did both in Imagination; that it was only Imagination, was not his Fault, for so he would have had it, and so he thought it was. It is the Intention which constitutes Guilt, and Angelo was guil-ty in Intention, and for what he knew, in fact, therefore, as far as lay in his Power, he was as guilty as Claudio.
               
               This Play therefore being absolutely de-fective in a due Distribution of Rewards and

Punishments; Measure for Measure ought not to be the Title, since Justice is not the Virtue it inculcates; nor can Shakespear's In-vention in the Fable be praised; for what he has altered from Cinthio, is altered greatly for the worse.
            
            
               

               The Ninth Novel of Bandello. Volume the Second.
               
                  WHEN the Scaligers were Lords of Verona, a fierce and bloody Enmity subsisted between two noble Families of that City, of greater Dignity and Riches than the rest; the Name of the one was Montecchio, the other Capellet: This vio-lent Hatred was the Cause of frequent bloody Engagements between the Relations and De-pendants of those two Lords; and the Numbers that were killed of both Parties on these Occa-sions, kept up and augmented the Fury of their several Descendants.
               
                  Bartholomew Scaliger, then at the Head of this Republic, laboured with the utmost Dili-gence to suppress these Disorders; but all his Cares could never wholly prevent them, so deeply was their Hatred of each other rooted in their Bosoms.
               
                  
Finding it impossible to entirely reconcile them, in order to put an End to the Affronts, which each Party gave and received from the other, and which was always followed by the Deaths of some amongst them, he commanded that the youngest of one Faction should al-ways give Way to the eldest of the other, whenever they happened to meet, by which Means many Disorders were avoided.
               About this Time, Romeo, the young Heir of the Montecchio Family, was violently en-amoured of a Lady in Verona, who, not-withstanding the extraordinary Beauty and Ac-complishments he was possest of, treated him with great Disdain.
               
                  Romeo, during two Years, pursued the in-exorable Beauty, employing all the Rhetoric of Sighs, Tears, Presents and Entertainments, to move her Heart; but all in vain; his Friends, who saw him languish out his Days in a hopeless Passion, were greatly alarmed; but neither their Remonstrances or Intreaties were able to effect his Cure.
               One of his Companions, who was dearer to him than the rest, greatly afflicted to behold him losing thus the Vigour of Youth in fol-lowing a Woman without Hopes of obtaining her, often took Occasion to blame his Perse-verance.
               
                  Romeo, said he, one Day to him, I love you as my Brother; and it gives me great Pain to see you thus consume away like Snow melting in the Sun; don't you see you waste your Time and spend your Fortune, without obtaining either Honour or Advantage: Your

Endeavours to win this Woman are all ineffec-tual; the more you sollicit her, the more rigid she becomes; certainly it is a great Folly to at-tempt a Thing which is not only difficult to do, but impossible; you may be convinced she nei-ther cares for you, or any Thing you can do to please her; perhaps she has some other Lover, who is so dear to her, she would not quit him for an Emperor: You are young, my dear Ro-meo, your Person is more lovely than any Youth's in this City; you are, (let me speak it, since it is Truth, to your Face,) you are generous, virtuous and elegant; to these amiable Qualities are ad-ded the more solid Advantages of Learning and Wit: You are the only Son of one of the greatest and richest of our Noblemen; does he restrain you in your Expences; does he con-troul you in your Pleasures? Is he not your Factor only to take Care of your Affairs, while you spend your Time as you please? Awake, I conjure you, and begin to reflect at length upon the Error you have been guilty of; remove from your Eyes the Veil which blinds you, and hinders you from seeing the Path you are pursuing; resolve to place your Affection on some Person more deserving, and chuse a Lady who will better reward your Love; a just Indignation is often more powerful in the Heart than Love itself: Now when Assemblies and Masquerades are held all over this great City, mix with the Company every where, and when you meet the ungrateful Woman you have solicited so long, gaze not on her Face, but reflect on her Injustice, her Cruelty and her Pride; do not doubt but the many In-juries

you have suffered will excite an Indig-nation so just and reasonable, that your Pas-sion will in Time yield to its Force, and you, by Degrees, regain your Liberty.
               To these Reasons, the faithful Friend of Romeo added many others, to engage him to quit his unsuccessful Pursuit: Romeo listened to him with Attention, and took a Resolution immediately to put his wise Councils in Prac-tice.
               The Feast being now begun, he had fre-quent Opportunities of meeting the scornful Maid; but he always carefully avoided look-ing at her, gazing on the other Ladies, and anxiously examining the Beauties of every one, to chuse her who was most agreeable to him.
               About this Time, Antonio Capellet, the Head of that Family, made a magnificent, Feast, to which he invited a great many of the chief Nobility and Ladies, most of the Youth of Quality being there; Romeo, notwithstanding the long continued Hatred between their Fa-milies, came thither also at Night, being masqued like the rest of the Company; but soon after throwing it off, as all the others did, he seated himself at one Corner of the Hall, which, by the great Number of Torches, being made as light as Day, he could conve-niently behold the whole Assembly.
               
                  Romeo soon drew the Eyes of the Company upon him, and of the Ladies particularly, who, struck with his Boldness in coming to that House, could not conceal their Admiration of it; his Enemies, however, on Account of his Youth, his extraordinary Beauty, the Sweet-ness

of his Manners, and the almost universal Love he had acquired, forbore to give him any Disturbance, which, perhaps, had he been elder, and less amiable, they might have done.
               
                  Romeo therefore, having leisure to consider the Beauty of the Ladies that were at the Feast, began to praise them more or less, ac-cording to his Taste, and, without dancing himself, took a Pleasure in looking upon those that did: While he was thus employed, he saw a young Lady of most exquisite Beauty, whose Name was unknown to him; his Heart immediately confessed this Object to be more charming than any he had ever seen; he gazed on her attentively, and the longer he gazed, the more Beauty and Graces he discovered in her. Finding an unusual Pleasure in contem-plating her, he was not able for a Moment to remove his Eyes from her Face, but darting a thousand passionate Looks at the young Beau-ty, he secretly resolved to exert his utmost En-deavours to gain her Affections.
               Thus was his former Passion vanquished by this new one, and gave Place to a Flame that was never extinguished but by his Death: Not daring in that suspected House to enquire the Name of the young Beauty that had charmed him, he contented himself with feeding his Eyes with her Sight, and finding new Graces in every Look and Action drank in large Draughts of the sweet Poison of Love.
               
                  Romeo being, as was said before, seated in a Corner of the Hall, had a full View of all the Company, who, in returning to their

Places after Dancing, passed close by him; Julietta, so was the young Lady called, who had charmed him, not having observed him before, was struck with Admiration of his Person, as she went by the Place where he sat: This fair One was Daughter to Capellet, the Master of the House, who had given the Feast, and ignorant of the Name and Quality of Romeo; yet he appearing to her the most beautiful Youth she had ever seen, she could not resist the Pleasure she took in gazing on him; but secretly snatching stolen Glances at him every Moment, an unusual Softness took Possession of her Heart, and filled it with all the sweet Inquietudes and tender Perplexities of a begining Passion: Not satisfied with gaz-ing on him at a Distance, she ardently wished he would mix among the Dancers, that she might have an Opportunity of hearing him speak, not doubting but her Ears would take in as much Pleasure from the Agreeableness of his Discourse, as her Eyes did Sweetness from his Sight, but Romeo wholly lost in the Plea-sure he took in looking upon her, shewed no Inclination to join the Company; and Julietta was equally incapable of any Delight, but looking at him.
               Their Eyes being thus frequently directed to each other, their passionate Glances often met; the Sighs which accompanied those Glances, betrayed the Emotions of their Hearts, and both were sensible that an Op-portunity of discovering their mutual Flame was equally desired by each.
               
                  
While they were thus taken up in exchang-ing tender and passionate Looks, the Ball broke up, and the Company mixing promis-cuously together, began the concluding Dance, called the Dance of the Torch, otherwise the Dance of the Hat.
               
               
                  Romeo, in the midst of the agreeable Con-fusion of this Dance, was snatched up by a Lady, who forcing him into the Croud, he performed his Part, and giving the Torch, as was the Custom, to another Lady, he drew near to Julietta, and took her by the Hand, to the inconceivable Transport of them both.
               
                  Julietta then seating herself between Romeo and Mercutio; the latter, who was a Courtier, gay, witty, and agreeably satirical, was as re-markable for the extraordinary Coldness of his Hand, as for the uncommon Sprightliness of his Disposition; and he holding one of Juli-etta's Hands, as Romeo did the other; she, who ardently desired to hear him speak, turn-ing towards him with an inchanting Smile, said softly and in a trembling Voice, gently pressing his Hand at the same Momentâ€” "Blessed be the Time, Sir, that you seated yourself near me."
               
                  Romeo, who well knew how to make use of Advantages, straining her Hand passionately in return, with Eyes which seemed to implore her Pity; and an Accent as if his Life hung suspended on her Answer, asked her the Meaning of such a Benediction.
               "Gentle Youth, replied Julietta with a Smile, I bless the Time of your coming hi-ther, because Signior Mercutio, whose Hand

lay the Result of my Searches before your Lordship, before that Judge whom Pliny himself would have wished for his Assessor to hear a lite-rary Cause.
            How much the Translation of the following Novels will add to the Re-putation of Shakespear, or take away from it, You, my Lord, and Men learned and candid like You, if any such can be found, must now de-termine. Some Danger, as I am in-formed, there is, lest his Admirers should think him injured by this At-tempt, and clamour as at the Dimi-nution of the Honour of that Nati-on, which boasts herself the Parent of so great a Poet.
            That no such Enemies may arise a-gainst me (though I am unwilling

is as cold as Ice, froze me all over by his Touch, and you, for which I am much obliged to you, by the kindly Warmth of yours, have restored me again."
               "Madam, replied Romeo immediately, I should think myself superlatively happy in be-ing able to do you any Service, and blest be-yond Measure if you will deign to command me as the meanest of your Servants; permit me however to tell you, that if my Hand has warmed you, the Fire of your bright Eyes has kindled such Flames in me, that unless you afford me some Assistance, I shall soon be con-sumed to Ashes."
               Scarce had he finished these last Words, when the Dance being ended, the Company began to disperse; and Julietta transported with the Excess of her new Passion; breathing an ardent Sigh and tenderly straining his Hand, replied in haste as she parted from him, "Alass! what can I say, but that I am more yours than my own!"
               
                  Romeo, in Hopes of knowing who she was, continued still in the Hall; but he had not waited long, 'till he was informed by a Friend, that she was the Daughter of the Lord Capellet, who had given the Feast.
               This News threw him into great Affliction, foreseeing the Difficulty and Danger there would be in pursuing his Passion; but the Wound was already given, and his whole Soul was now infected with the sweet Venom of Love.
               On the other Side, Julietta equally desirous of knowing the Name of him who had con-quered

her Heart; calling an old Woman, who had nursed her, to a Window, which looked into a Street, through which the Com-pany was passing, by the Light of a great Number of Torches, she began to enquire the Names of several of the Masquers as they went along; and at last directing her Eyes to Romeo, asked her who that fine Youth was who carried his Masque in his Hand. The good Woman who knew him very well, told her it was Romeo, Son of the Lord Montec-chio.
               
               
                  Julietta, struck with the Sound of that Name, as with a Thunderbolt, began now to despair of ever gaining the Object of her Af-fections for a Husband: Concealing however her Confusion from the Observation of her Nurse, she retired to Bed; but her Mind was agitated with so many different Thoughts, that she could take no Repose: Love and Despair bred a cruel Conflict in her Soul, yet Love had taken so full and absolute Possession of it, that her Desire increased with the Impossibility of gratifying it. "Ah! cried she to herself, how have I suffered my Affections to be thus transported! how do I know (credulous Fool as I am) whether Romeo really loves me? Perhaps the artful Youth means only to delude me, with a dissembled Passion, that by rob-bing me of my Honour, he may revenge him-self of my Family, and encrease the rooted Hatred between our Fathers; but can it be, that a Soul so generous as his, should form a Design to ruin one who loves and adores him? Ah! if the Face be the Index of the Mind,

his is all Loveliness and Beauty, Cruelty and Deceit can never harbour in so sweet a Dwel-ling; from a Form so inchanting nothing can be expected but Truth, Gentleness and Love: But suppose, added she, that he loves me ho-nourably, have I not Reason to believe that my Father will never consent to our Union; and yet, who knows but our mutual Passion may be the Means of procuring a firm and perpetual Peace between our Families; I have often heard that not only the Peace of private Families has been procured by Marriages, but that warring Nations have been made Friends by that Means; ought I not then to hope that our two Houses may be reconciled by such an Event." Resting then upon this soothing Thought, whenever Romeo went through the Street where she lived, she al-ways shewed herself at a Balcony, giving him such bewitching Smiles as he passed, as filled his whole Soul (which like hers, had been tost between Hope and Fear) with in-expressible Delight.
               It was not without great Danger to his his Person, that he thus haunted the Street, where she dwelt, both Night and Day; but Julietta's Smiles inflaming his Desires, he could not resist the sweet Violence that drew him continually thither; the Chamber of this fair Maid had a Window in it, which looked into a narrow Lane. Romeo when he had passed the great Street, and arrived to the Head of this Lane, often beheld her at this Window, to which she would come very obligingly when she saw him; and by her

Looks express the Pleasure she took in seeing him. One Night when Romeo came, as he was wont, to this Place, Julietta seeing him, open-ed the Window; the Moon shone so bright, that though he retired, upon her looking out into an old ruinous Building which fronted the Window, yet she distinguished him plainly, and no Person being with her in the Chamber, she ventured to call out to him. "Romeo, said she, what do you do here alone, at such an Hour? should you be discovered, I trem-ble for your Life; are you ignorant of the cruel Enmity there is between our Families, and how many Lives have been lost by it on both Sides? certainly if you are taken, you will be barbarously murdered; why will you thus endanger your own Life and my Ho-nour?"
               "The ardent Passion you have inspired me with, answered he, is the Cause of my com-ing hither; I know if I am discovered by your Relations, they will endeavour to kill me, but I shall defend myself as well as I am able, and though I may be overpowered by superior Force, yet I will not dye alone; to dye near you will take off the Bitterness of Death; yet be assured, Madam, I never will be the Occa-sion of bringing any Stain upon your Honour; but will with Pleasure sacrifice my Life, to preserve it inviolate."
               "But what is it you re-quire of me, inter-rupted Julietta?"
               
               "That you would permit me to enter your Chamber, Madam, replied Romeo, that I may with less Danger make known to you the

Greatness of my Passion, and the cruel Tor-ments I suffer for your Sake."
               
                  Julietta, a little offended at this Demand, replied in some Confusion, "Romeo, you know the Extent of your own Passion, and I know that of mine; I know that I love you, as much as it is possible for a Person to love, and perhaps more than is consistent with my Ho-nour; however, I must tell you, that if you hope to possess me by any other Means than Matrimony, you are much deceived; and be-cause I am sensible you expose yourself to great Danger by coming hither so frequently, I am willing to bring this Affair to a speedy Con-clusion; therefore, if you desire to be mine, as I wish to be eternally yours, you will make me your Wife, and for that Purpose I will be ready to meet you at any convenient Place, whatever Time you shall appoint me; but, if you have any dishonourable Intentions towards me, go away I conjure you, and suffer me to live in Peace."
               
                  Romeo, who only wished to possess her with Honour, heard this Proposition with Trans-port, and told her, "that he would marry her at any Time, and in any Manner she pleased."
               "'Tis well, replied Julietta, let our Nup-tials then be celebrated, by the Reverend Friar Lorenzo of Reggio, who is my spiri-tual Father." To this Romeo readily agreed, the good Friar being very intimate in his Fa-mily; and it was resolved between them, that Romeo should speak to him the next Day upon that Affair.
               
                  
Friar Lorenzo, in whom the Lovers chose to confide upon this. Occasion, was of the Order of the Minors, a learned Theologician and Philosopher; had great Knowledge of Herbs, and was well skilled in the Magic Art; and that he might maintain himself in the good Opinion of the Vulgar, and quietly enjoy those Plea-sures, for which he had a Taste, he endea-voured to procure the Friendship of all Per-sons of distinguished Rank and Reputation: In this he succeeded so well, that he had many Friends among the Nobility of Verona, parti-cularly the Father of Romeo, a Nobleman in great Credit and Esteem, who had a high Opinion of his Sanctity and Wisdom.
               
                  Romeo also held him in great Esteem, and the Friar, who knew him to be a prudent and generous Youth, had a tender Affection For him. The Reverend Father, who confessed almost all the Persons of Quality of both Sexes in the City, was also very intimate in the Family of the Capelletti, and was therefore intrusted with the spiritual Direction of Ju-lietta.
               
               
                  Romeo, the next Day after his Conference with his Mistress, went to the Church of St. Francis, and related to Friar Lorenzo the whole Story of his Passion for Julietta, and the happy Conclusion to which he had brought it, entreating at the same time his Assistance to unite them for ever.
               The Friar hearing this Account, promised to do all he required, as well because he was not able to deny Romeo any thing, as he hoped this Marriage would reconcile the two

Houses of the Montecchi and Capelletti, and by that Means acquire to himself the Favour of Signor Bartholomew, who passionately wished to compose the Disorders their Enmity cre-ated in his City.
               The two Lovers, now only waiting for some Occasion of going to Confession, in order to effect their Design, Julietta, for the greater Conveniency, resolved to trust her Nurse, who slept with her, with her Love for Romeo; his extreme Affection for her, and their in-tended Marriage.
               The good Woman greatly concerned at such a precipitate Design, endeavoured to dis-swade her from it, but to no Purpose; and moved with the affecting Arguments of Ju-lietta, was at last prevailed upon to carry a Letter to Romeo.
               
               The Lover was transported with Joy at the Contents; which directed him to come, at five o'Clock that Night, to the Window in the Lane; bringing with him a Ladder of Ropes, by which he might ascend to the Top.
               
                  Romeo, committing the Care of providing the Ladder to a faithful Servant of his, named Pietro, they both, at the appointed Hour, went to the Place where Julietta expected them.
               As soon as she saw Romeo, she let down a Cord from the Window, which they fasten-to one End of the Ladder, she drew it up, and with the Assistance of her Nurse fixed it se-curely at the Top, while Romeo and his Ser-vant took Care to fasten it well below.
               
                  

                  Romeo then boldly ascending the Ladder, Pietro retired into the old ruinous House, till his Master had Occasion for him: The iron Bars before the Window were set so close, that it was with Difficulty the passionate Romeo could pass his Hand through to clasp that of his adored Julietta.â€”"Oh! Romeo, cried the trans-ported Maid, dearer to me than the Light of my Eyes, I desired to see you here, that I might inform you I have ordered Matters so as that I can go to Confession with my Mo-ther on Friday next; we shall come to the Church about the Time that the Sermon be-gins; take Care to acquaint Father Lorenzo, that he may have every Thing in readiness."
               
                  Romeo assuring her that the Friar was dis-posed to do whatever they desired, they began to enter into a tender Conversation, which the Necessity of parting for Fear of a Discovery interrupting the Lover descending the Ladder, took Leave of his dear Julietta, who, though excessively pleased with the past Interview, thought every Moment an Age till she could call Romeo her own; and Romeo, who was al-most transported out of himself, spent the Time in discoursing with his Confidant on his approaching Happiness.
               The destined Day being arrived, Lady Gio-vanni, the Mother of Julietta, taking with her her Daughter and some of her Women, went to the Church of St. Francis, which was then in the Citadel; the old Lady, as soon as she entered, calling for Friar Lorenzo, told him, she had come early with Julietta to Confession, be-cause she knew he would be much hurried that

Day, having so many spiritual Children to confess.
               The Friar, who had been instructed before by Romeo, and had him then concealed in his Confessionary, giving the Ladies the Benedic-tion, went into the Convent, and entering the Confessionary where Romeo was, made Juli-etta, who first presented herself, go into the other Cell, which was slightly partitioned off from that which he and Romeo were in, hav-ing also a Grate between; as soon as she was entered, he gave the Sign that Romeo was within, and removing the Grate, after the first Salutation, said to her,â€”"Daughter, Romeo has, informed me, that you are willing to take him for a Husband, and he also is de-sirous of having you for a Wife, do you both continue to be thus disposed?"
               The Lovers making Answer, that the wished for nothing else; the Friar, after a short Discourse in Praise of holy Matrimony, pronounced the accustomed Form of Words ordained by the Church, and gave them the nuptial Benediction.
               
                  Romeo then presenting his beloved Julietta with a Ring, which she received with unspeak-able Pleasure, he consulted with her on the Means he should use to gain Access to her at Night, and tenderly saluting her, went cau-tiously out of the Church.
               The Friar, replacing the Grate, heard the Confession of the happy Julietta, and dismis-sing her, heard also those of her Mother, and the Women who attended them, and they returned again to their House.
               
                  
Night being come, Romeo, with his Servant, went to the Garden belonging to the Lord Capellet's House, and ascending the Wall by the Help of his faithful Pietro, he got easily over to the other Side, where he found his Bride; who, together with her Nurse, was expecting him.
               
                  Romeo, as soon as he saw her, ran to her with open Arms, and Julietta eagerly flying to him, threw herself on his Neck, and embraced him with inexpressible Transport; they passed the whole Night in the Garden without Fear of being discovered; and when the Morning approached, Romeo, after consulting with his fair Spouse on the Methods they should use to reconcile their Parents, took Leave of her with a tender Embrace, and returned to his House, looking upon himself to be the happiest of all Men in the Possession of so beautiful a Creature; and Julietta, who thought the whole World could not produce so lovely and accomplished a Youth as her Romeo, had no other Allay to her Happiness but the ardent Desire she felt to have their two Families re-conciled, that her Marriage might no lon-ger be concealed.
               While the new married Couple were obliged to content themselves with short and stolen In-terviews, Friar Lorenzo was secretly practising Means to reconcile their two Houses, and had put Matters in such a Train, that he had some Hopes of accomplishing it.
               When the Feast of Easter was celebrated, it happened that great Numbers of Coaches were assembled at the Gate of the Borsori, near

to believe it) I am far from being too confident, for who can fix Bounds to Bigotry and Folly? My Sex, my Age, have not given me many Opportunities of mingling in the World; there may be in it many a Species of Absurdity which I have never seen, and among them such Vanity as pleases itself with false Praise bestowed on another, and such Superstition as worships Idols, without supposing them to be Gods.
            But the Truth is, that a very small Part of the Reputation of this mighty Genius depends upon the naked Plot, or Story of his Plays. He liv-ed in an Age when the Books of Chivalry were yet popular, and when therefore the Minds of his Auditors were not accustomed to balance Pro-babilities, or to examine nicely the

the Castle Vecchio, or Old Castle, and many of the Capelletti and Montecchi meeting in that Place, assaulted each other furiously with their Arms: Among the Capelletti was a noble Youth, named Tibbald, a first Cousin of Julietta's who being possessed of great personal Courage, animated his People against the Montecchi, and urging them to have no Consideration for any Person whatever among their Enemies, the Fray grew very bloody, both Parties being continually encreased by other of their Parti-zans who joined them.
               
                  Romeo, who was going through the City on some Diversion with several of his Compa-nions, and a few Attendants, happened to pass by while the Combatants were engaged; this Sight gave him great Affliction, as he had Hopes from the Friar's Endeavours, that Peace would have been made between their Families; being desirous therefore of putting an End to the Fight, he turned to his Companions and Servants, and speaking so loud that he was heard by many in the Street; "Brothers, said he, let us thrust ourselves between them, and try, if by any Means we can oblige them to lay down their Arms:" With these Words he pressed in among the Combatants, followed by his Friends and Servants, labouring both with Words and Actions to prevail upon them to cease their Contention; but his Entreaties and Endeavours were all ineffectual; their Fu-ry had risen to such Excess, that they minded nothing but how to be revenged on each other, many of each Party lying dead upon the Ground.
               
                  
While Romeo was thus generously employed in endeavouring to calm their Rage, the fu-rious Tibbald drew near him, and gave him a thrust with his Sword in the Side, which, by Reason of a net-work of Steel he wore beneath his Cloaths, did him no Harm.
               
                  Romeo, notwithstanding this Outrage, turn-ing towards him, said, with a friendly Ac-cent, "Tibbald, if you believe I came hither with any Intention to fight with you, or any of your Party, you are much deceived: I passed this Way by Chance, and have no other Design in mixing among you, but to make those who belong to me retire."
               
                  Tibbald, either not understanding these Words, or seeming not to understand them, cried out, "Ah Traitor, thou shalt die! and furiously throwing himself upon Romeo, struck him with great Violence on the Head, but the Force of the Blow, though weakened by the steel Head-piece he wore, yet so enraged Ro-meo, that, wrapping his Cloak about his Arm by Way of Shield, he turned the point of his Sword towards his Enemy, which piercing his Throat, went quite through his Neck, and came out behind, so that the unhappy Tibbald fell dead immediately on the Earth.
               The Guards approaching at the Report of this Battle, the Combatants dispersed different Ways; and Romeo, full of Grief for having killed Tibbald, fled to the Church of St. Fran-cis, followed by a great many of his Friends and Servants.
               Father Lorenzo was much affected at the News of Tibbald's Death, which put it out of

his Power to accomplish the Peace he medita-ted between them; however, he received Ro-meo with great Kindness, and concealed him in his Chamber at the Convent.
               The Capelletti assembling together, went to complain to Signor Bartholomew of the In-jury they had suffered from Romeo; and the Father of Romeo, together with all the Persons of Quality among the Montecchi, went also to prove that Romeo had not engaged in the Fight, but sought only to part the Combatants, and being basely wounded by Tibbald, killed him in his own Defence.
               Although it was made very clear, that the Capelletti assaulted the Montecchi first, and al-so proved by many Witnesses, that Romeo en-deavoured to part them, and was wounded by Tibbald while he was thus employed, yet Sig-nor Bartholomew banished him from Verona, and ordered the rest to forbear such Hostilities for the future.
               The Death of Tibbald caused great Affliction in the Family of the Capelletti; but Jullietta wept not for her Cousin's Death, but for the Banishment of Romeo; having however that Excuse for her Sorrow, she gave free Vent to her Tears, and losing all the Hopes she had formerly entertained of being happy with her beloved Romeo, she wholly abandoned herself to Grief.
               Understanding that he was concealed in Father Lorenzo's Convent, she wrote a Letter to him, filled with moving Complaints of their miserable Fortune, intreating him with the most tender Instances of Affection, that he

would allow her to accompany him in his Ba-nishment.
               
                  Romeo received this Letter by the Hands of the old Woman who was the Confidant of their Marriage; and in his Answer, he con-jured his dear Julietta not to afflict herself; that in a proper Time he would do all she desired; but at present he had not fixed upon the Place of his Exile, though he was resolved it should be as near her as possible; and concluded with earnestly desiring her to give him an Oppor-tunity of seeing her before he went away.
               
                  Julietta naming the Garden for the Place of this last sad Interview, Romeo, at the ap-pointed Hour, came secretly out of the Convent by the Assistance of Father Lorenzo, and, at-tended by his faithful Pietro, came to the Place where he was expected.
               
                  Julietta received him with a Flood of Tears, and Grief so totally possessed their Souls, that they continued a long Time unable to speak to each other; recovering a little from this si-lent Excess of Sorrow, they flew into each others Arms, mingling Tears with their Em-braces, and bitter Complaints against the Cruelty of their Fortune.
               Great Part of the Night being wasted in this Manner, Julietta, with the most earnest and affecting Intreaties, urged her beloved Romeo to permit her to go with him into Banishment.
               "Do not, my Lord, cried she, do not leave me behind you; I will cut off this long Hair, and dressed in the Habit of a Boy, follow you wherever you go; my tender Cares shall soften the Rigour of your Exile; can you have

a more faithful Servant than me? Oh, my dearest Husband, grant me this Favour, I con-jure you; let me share your Fate whatever it be; I cannot be unhappy if I am with you."
               
                  Romeo, with the tenderest Language that Love could dictate, endeavoured to comfort his afflicted Wife; he assured her that his Sen-tence of Banishment would be shortly revoked; the Prince had given his Father some Reason to expect it; "But happen what will, said he, my lovely Julietta, not in the Habit of a Page can I consent to see you; no, when you do come, it must be in a Manner suitable to the Dignity of your Birth, and the Quality of your Husband: Depend upon it, continued he, my Banishment will not continue more than a Year; in that Time our Parents may be reconciled; the Prince himself will labour to make Peace between them; but if these Hopes fail me, I will then take another Course, for it is impossible I should be able to live long without you."
               
                  Julietta, yielding to the Force of these Rea-sons and Persuasions, they began to settle the Method of corresponding by Letters; and the Morn now breaking, amidst thousand Sighs, Tears, and tender Embraces, they took Leave of each other; Romeo returned to the Con-vent, and Julietta to her Chamber.
               In two or three Days, every Thing being prepared for his Departure, Romeo left the Convent, and, disguised like a foreign Mer-chant, went privately out of Verona: Several of his most faithful Friends conducted him safely to Mantua; where he hired a magnifi-cent

House, and having large Appointments from his Father, lived with a Splendor befit-ting his Quality.
               
                  Julietta, in the mean Time, gave herself wholly up to Sorrow; she loathed her Food; Sleep fled from her Eyes; she passed the Days in Sighs and Tears, and the Nights in Com-plaints and Lamentations. Her Mother ob-serving her continual Grief, reproved her for it many Times; telling her, she had wept enough for the Death of her Cousin, and that it was Time to put an End to her Affliction upon his Account.â€”Julietta replied, that she knew no Cause for Affliction; nevertheless she continued to fly from all Company and Diversion, and gave herself up entirely a Prey to Sadness and Tears; her fixed Melancholy making so great an Alteration in her lovely Face, that she no longer had any Resemblance of the once gay and beautiful Julietta.
               
               
                  Romeo never failed to make Use of every Opportunity to write to her, always comfort-ing her in his Letters with Hopes of being soon together, and tenderly intreating her to moderate her Affliction, and become easy and chearful as she was wont to be; but all was in vain; the Absence of Romeo was the Cause of her Unhappiness, and till that was removed she was incapable of receiving any Comfort.
               Her Mother at last, supposing the Sadness of her Daughter proceeded from her Discontent at seeing so many of her young Companions married, while she had no Husband proposed to her, acquainted her Spouse, the Lord Ca-pellet, with her Suspicions:â€”"Our Daugh-ter,

said she, does nothing but sigh and weep; I have frequently asked her the Cause of this immoderate Affliction; she answers me always in the same Tone, that she knows of no Cause; yet every one in the House perceives her continual Melancholy; certainly some vio-lent Uneasiness preys upon her Heart; and if she is suffered to go on thus, she will consume away insensibly like Wax before the Fire: I have imagined a thousand Reasons for this her Sorrow; but what seems to me to be the most probable is, that having since last Carnival, seen all her Companions become Wives, she is afflicted because a Husband has not yet been proposed to her; she will be eighteen Years of Age St. Euphemia's Day next, and in my O-pinion it is now Time we should procure her a good and honourable Husband, for a young Virgin is not Merchandize that will keep long in a House."
               "Since it is your Opinion, replied the Lord Antonio to his Wife, that this Melan-choly of our Daughter is caused by her not having a Husband proposed to her, I will en-deavour to procure one suitable to the Dignity of our House; but let it be your Care to find out whether her Affections are yet engaged, that I may propose such a Match to her as may be agreeable to her Inclinations."
               
                  Giovanni replied, that she would do all in her Power to satisfy him in this Particular; and accordingly she again questioned all Ju-lietta's Attendants, and every other Person in the House, who she thought was likely to give her any Information; but could discover nothing.
               
                  
Some Time after this, a Match was pro-posed to Lord Antonio, between the young Paris, Count of Lodrona, and his Daughter.
               Lord Antonio was extremely well pleased with the Proposal, the Count being young, handsome and very rich; and desired his Lady to acquaint her Daughter with the advanta-geous Offer that was made her.
               Lady Giovanni did as she was directed; but Julietta received this News with such appa-rent Grief, that her Mother, after long en-deavouring in vain to find out the Cause, said at last, "By what I can understand then, my Daughter, you are not willing to be married."
               "It is true, Madam, replied Julietta, I never intend to marry any one; and if you love me, and have any Regard for my Peace, you will not think of giving me a Husband."
               "Will you be a Nun then, replied the Mother, in great Amazement; tell me what are your Intentions?"â€”"I will not be a Nun, said Julietta; I know not what I would be; but I long to be in my Grave."
               Lady Giovanni, equally surprized and of-fended at this Answer, was at a Loss what to say or do.â€”She again enquired of her Daugh-ter's Attendants if they knew the Cause of her extreme Melancholy.â€”They replied, that ever since her Cousin Tibbald's Death, she had wholly abandoned herself to Sorrow, was al-ways in Tears, and sought all Occasions of being alone.
               
                  Giovanni relating all this to her Husband: He ordered Julietta to be called, and, after some little Discourse with her, "Daughter,

said he, you are now old enough to be married; I have found a Husband for you, who is young, handsome, noble and rich; it is the Count of Lodrona; dispose yourself therefore to comply with my Will in this Affair, such Matches offer but seldom."
               
                  Julietta, with more Spirit than became one of her Years, replied boldly, that she would not marry.
               Her Father, greatly enraged, was ready to beat her; but checking his Fury a little, he contented himself with threatening her with the most cruel Effects of his Displeasure, if she continued disobedient, and concluded with telling her, that whether she was willing or not she must prepare in a few Days to go with him, her Mother, and other Relations to Villa Franca, to meet the young Count, who would be there with a great Retinue on Pur-pose to see her; adding, that if she made any Reply, or Resistance, he would break her Head, and make her the most miserable Crea-ture that ever was born.
               
                  Julietta remained like one Thunder-struck, at this cruel Language, and, not daring to re-ply, she retired to her Chamber, and there wrote an Account of all that had passed to Romeo.
               
               In a short Time she received an Answer from her beloved Husband, who earnestly con-jured her not to afflict herself, but to depend upon the Promise he made her, to come soon to Verona, and take her away privately to Mantua.
               
               
                  
While she waited the Effect of this Pro-mise, the Day approached on which she was to go to Villa-Franca, where her Father had a fine Seat. Notwithstanding her great Reluctance, she was obliged to go, and the young Count of Lodrona, who first saw her at Church, was so struck with her Charms, though now a little impaired by her continual Grief, that he immediately concluded the Marriage Treaty with her Father; who re-turned with Julietta to Verona. Here he in-formed her, that her Marriage with the Count was absolutely resolved upon, exhorting her to be chearful, and submit to his Will with a good Grace.
               
                  Julietta made no Answer, but retired to her Chamber, in order to conceal her Af-fliction, being informed that her Nuptials with Count Paris were to be celebrated in a few Weeks. Not knowing what to do in this terrible Extremity, she at last resolved to go to Father Lorenzo, and consult with him upon Means to avoid this detested Husband.
               Accordingly the next Saint's Day she went to her Mother's Chamber. "My dear Mother, said she at her Entrance, I cannot imagine how this strange Melancholy has grown upon me, but ever since the Death of my Cousin Tibbald I have been able to take no Pleasure in any Thing, and my De-jection encreases every Day; I think I will go on this blessed Saint's Day to Confessi-on; perhaps I may receive some Consola-tion by that Means. What say you, my

Proportion between Causes and Ef-fects. It was sufficient to recom-mend a Story, that it was far removed from common Life, that its Chang-es were frequent, and its Close pa-thetic.
            This Disposition of the Age con-curred so happily with the Imaginati-on of Shakespear that he had no De-sire to reform it, and indeed to this he was indebted for the licentious Va-riety, by which he has made his Plays more entertaining than those of any other Author.
            He had looked with great Atten-tion on the Scenes of Nature; but his chief Skill was in Human Acti-ons, Passions, and Habits; he was therefore delighted with such Tales as afforded numerous Incidents, and

sweet Mother, are you pleased with this Pro-position? Shall I go?"
               Lady Giovanni, who was a very pious Woman, greatly approved of her Daughter's Intention, and went with her to the Church of St. Francis; where, ordering Father Lo-renzo to be called, she permitted Julietta to go into the Confessionary, and being entered; "My Father, said the afflicted Julietta, no one knows better than yourself, what has passed between Romeo and me, therefore it is needless to repeat it; you have no doubt read the Letter, which I put into your Hand to be sent to him; in which I informed him, that my Father had promised me to Paris, Count of Lodrona. Romeo writes to me, that he will shortly come and take Measures to prevent this ever happening; but alas! Heaven knows when he will perform his Promise; the Day of my Nuptials is now fixed; I see no Way to avoid the hated Count, who appears to me as a Robber and Assassin. You know that I am the Wife of Romeo, and that I cannot be another's; no, I will be my dear Romeo's eternally, this is my fixed Reso-solution; to you therefore I come for Ad-vice and Assistance; hear first, however, what I propose. You shall, my dear Father, pro-vide me a Suit of Boys Cloaths, in which I will leave my Father's House very early in the Morning, and thus disguised travel to Man-tua, and keep myself concealed in the House of my dear Romeo."
               
               The Friar, who was not at all pleased with this Proposition, repliedâ€”"My dear Daugh-ter,

it is impossible to execute, with Safety, the Design you have formed, the Dangers are too great; you are very young, your Per-son and Consttiution extremely delicate; you could not endure the Fatigue of such a Journey; you have never been accustomed to walk, and not being acquainted with the Way, would wander here and there, without knowing whither to go: Your Father would no sooner miss you, than he would send People to the City Gates, and into all the Streets to find you, it would be impossible to escape the Search. When you are brought back, will not your Father, by Threats, and perhaps Blows, force you to declare the Reason of your Flight, disguised like a Boy? and when he shall understand, that you was going to Romeo, will not he effectually prevent your ever seeing him more?
               
                  Julietta, acquiescing in these Reasons of the good Father, replied, "Since you do not approve of what I have proposed, which I am now convinced is not practicable, give me your Advice what to do; teach me how to untye this cruel Knot, by which, misera-ble that I am, I find myself bound; assist me if possible to get to my dear Romeo, for without him I can no longer live; but if you cannot do that, help me at least to the Means of keeping myself entirely his; my Husband has told me of your Knowledge of Herbs, and that you can distil a Water which in two Hours time will steal away Life, from the Person who takes it, without giving any Pain.â€”Give me such a Quantity of this

Water, as will deliver me from this Count, and make me able to keep my Faith with Romeo: If he loves me as I love him, he will rather see me in the Arms of Death, than in those of any other Person; by helping me to this quiet Death, you will deliver me and my Family from great Disgrace, for if I am driven to Despair, and find no other Way to avoid the Miseries that wait me, I will cut my Throat in the Night, for I am determined to dye, rather than violate my Faith to Ro-meo."
               
               Father Lorenzo, who was one of the greatest Chemists in his Time, and was well acquainted with the Virtues of Herbs and Stones, among other wonderful Secrets he was possest of, he had found out and composed with many somniferous Simples a certain Paste, which being reduced to Powder, and a small Quantity of it mixed with Water, would put the Person who drank it into a Sleep so like Death, that the most skilful Physician in the World might be deceived by it, holding them in this sweet Trance forty Hours or more, according to the Quantity of the Pow-der, or the Constitution of the Patient. He understanding, therefore, the fixed Determi-nation of the unhappy Julietta, was so moved with Compassion, that it was with Difficulty he restrained his Tears.
               "My Daughter, said he, you must, not think of giving yourself Death, because you may depend upon it there is no returning to Life, until the Day of universal Judgment, when together, with all the Dead, you shall

be raised again; be patient, and resolve to live as long as God pleases, he gave you Life, he preserves it, and in his own good Time he will resume it. Banish these melancholy Thoughts from your Mind; you are young, and ought to be fond of Life, that you may enjoy your Romeo; do not doubt, but we shall find a Remedy for the Evils you are afraid ofâ€”You see in what great Credit and Re-putation I am in this magnificen City, should it be known that I was privy to your Marriage with Romeo, what Disgrace would it not bring upon me! I will my dear Daugh-ter so manage Matters, that, without draw-ing you into any Danger, you shall preserve your Faith to Romeo; but you must be coura-gious and resolved, and punctually observe all my Directions.'
               He then related to her the extraordinary Virtues of the Powder before mentioned, as-suring her that it had been often tried, and always found perfect. "My Daughter, added he, this precious and valuable Powder, will, as I have said, put you into so sound and quiet a Sleep, that if Galen, Hippocrates, Mesue, Avicenna, and all the Colleges of the most ex-cellent Physicians that are, or ever were, were to see you, and feel your Pulse, they would with one Voice declare you dead. When you have drank the Mixture you will in a few Moments fall asleep; at your usual Hour of rising your Attendants will come to awake you, but not be able; and you being cold as Ice, without Pulse, or any Signs of Life, your Parents, Relations, and all who see you,

will believe you to be dead, and you will be carried to the Monument of your Family, there you will quietly repose the Night and Day: I will take care to dispatch a Messen-ger to Romeo, and he and I will come the Night following that which you are interred to the Monument; and when the Dose is fully digested, you will awake from this artificial Death as fresh and lovely as when you rise in a Morning from your Bed, after a quiet Rest; we will then take you from the Monument, and you shall return with Romeo secretly to Mantua, and there remain concealed till the blessed Peace I am meditating reconciles your two Houses; but I must again repeat to you that Secrecy and Courage is absolutely necessary for our Design, otherwise you will ruin both yourself and me."
               
                  Julietta, who would have passed through a glowing Furnace to get to Romeo, gave abso-lute Credit to the Friar's Words, and replied, "Father, I will put myself entirely into your Hands, and perform whatever you require with the greatest Secrecy."
               The Friar then going to the Chamber, re-turned in a few Moments with a sufficient Quantity of the Powder; which he directed her to mix in a Glass of Water. Julietta, with many Thanks, received it, and put it into a Purse, which she carefully concealed in her Bosom.
               The Friar, who could with Difficulty be-lieve so young a Creature had Fortitude enough to suffer herself to be interred living in a Sepul-chre with putrefied Carcasses, said to her:
               
                  
"But my Daughter, tell me sincerely, do you not tremble at the Thoughts of being in-tombed amongst mouldering Bodies; where also the Corse of your Cousin Tibbald, newly slain, is interred?"
               "Father, replied the determined Julietta, do not trouble yourself about my Fears; if I thought I should find my Romeo by passing through the Midst of infernal Flames, I would without trembling dare the everlasting Fires."
               "In the Name of God then, said the Friar, go on with your Enterprize." Then taking leave of her, he went back to his Chamber, and Julietta joined her Mother, who was waiting for her in the Church; and as soon as they were at home, "Certainly, my dear Mother, said Julietta, Father Lorenzo is a most holy Man; he has comforted me so much by his pious Discourse, that the terrible Melancholy I have so long laboured under, begins already to abate of its Force."
               Lady Giovanni, who already perceived an agreeable Change in the Countenance of her Daughter, was extremely pleased, and thanked God and the good Friar for it a thousand Times; telling her Husband they ought, in Gratitude for such a Service from Friar Lo-renzo, to make a present to his Monastery.
               
                  Julietta's Chearfulness persuading both her Father and Mother that there was no Cause for the Suspicion they had entertained of her be-ing secretly in Love, they began to repent they had entered into such strict Engagements with the Count of Lodrona, because the extreme Youth of their Daughter made them willing to

keep her unmarried two or three Years longer; but the Match having been concluded upon on both Sides, they could not break it off without great Scandal.
               The Night before the Day on which the Nuptials were to be celebrated, Julietta, who thought every Moment a Year till she drank the Potion, mixed it with some Water in a Phial, and placed it secretly at her Bed's Head; the Nurse who lay with her, falling asleep soon after she was in Bed.
               
                  Julietta, who could not take any Repose, passed the Night in various and affecting Thoughts; the Dawn approaching, put her in Mind that it was Time to drink the Potion; when the Image of TÃ®bbald, dead as she had lately seen him, with the Blood flowing from his Wound, rose to her Imagination, and re-flecting that she would soon be inclosed in a dark Monument amidst so many dead Bodies and mouldering Bones, her Blood froze in her Veins, a cold Sweat hung upon all her Limbs, and she began to tremble like a Leaf shaken by the Winds.â€”"Alas! said she, softly sigh-ing, what am I going to do? Where shall I suf-fer myself to be carried? If I should awake be-fore the Friar and Romeo come to take me out of the Monument, what will become of me? How shall I be able to endure the Stench of the dead Body of Tibbald! I, who cannot suffer any disagreeable Smell to approach me! who knows how many Serpents and horrid Worms there may be in that Sepulchre! Creatures I so much fear and abhor; and if I am terrified only at the Sight of them, how shall I endure to have

them stinging and crawling about me? how often have I heard horrid Stories related of dreadful Things which happen in the Night in Churches and Churchyards!"
               These, and many more Thoughts of the like Nature, so tormented her Imagination, that she began to deliberate with herself whe-ther she should not throw away that terrible Potion.
               Continuing thus irresolute a long Time, her fervent Love for Romeo at last got the bet-ter of her Fears, and the Day now shining through her Window, she took the Phial from her Pillow, and couragiously drank off the Li-quor, which, in a few Moments, produc-ing its usual Effects, she fell in a profound Sleep.
               Her Nurse, who had been sensible she had slept but little in the Night, thinking she was now reposing, rose softly for Fear of di-sturbing her, and went about her usual Busi-ness; and when it was Time to awake her, she returned to her Chamber, saying as she entered, "Up, up you Slug-a-bed, its Time to rise;" then opening the Window, and per-ceiving Julietta did not yet move, she ap-proached the Bed, crying "Rise, rise you lazy ones;" but the good old Woman was calling to the Deaf;â€”then raising her Voice, she called her aloud, shaking her to dissipate her Sleep; but all her vital Faculties were so bound up, that the loudest and most horrible Thunders would not have been able to awake her.
               The poor old Woman believing her now to be certainly dead, burst into Tears and

Complaints, and went to acquaint the unhap-py Mother with the News, who, flying with distracted Pace to Julietta's Chamber, and be-holding her stretched breathless upon the Bed, she filled the Air with dreadful Shrieks, utter-ing such moving Expressions of Sorrow as might have softened the Rage of Tygers them-selves. The Tears and Groans of the Nurse, and piercing Cries of the wretched Mother, brought all the Family to the Chamber, and among the rest the Lord Antonio, who ap-proaching the Bed, and finding his Daughter without Sense or Motion, and cold as Ice, A-stonishment and Grief made him for some Mo-ments immoveable as a Statue.
               The sad News being spread through the Ci-ty, all the Relations and Friends of the Fami-ly hastened to Lord Antonio's House, and filled it with Tears and Lamentations; the most fa-mous Physicians were immediately sent for; but all their Art proved ineffectual, and they declared she was absolutely dead.
               At this cruel Confirmation of their Fears, their Weepings and Lamentations redoubled; the whole City took Part in the Grief of this Family, and every one bewailed the unexpect-ed Death of the young and beautiful Julietta.
               
               But what Words can express the deep Di-stress, the wild Affliction of the wretched Mo-ther! deaf to all the Consolation that was of-fered to her, she gave a Loose to Despair: Now in the wild Agony of Grief she tore her Hair, and shrieking, pierced the Skies with her Complaints; now sinking under the Load of unutterable Sorrow, with Eyes streaming

with Tears, and Sighs which seemed to shake her whole Frame, she silently bewailed her Loss; three Times she threw herself upon the Bed, and clasping the cold Julietta to her sob-bing Bosom, fell breathless on the Body, and was with Difficulty brought back to Life.
               Lord Antonio, who had tenderly loved his Daughter, was no less afflicted for her Death, than his Wife; but strove with manly Forti-tude to conceal his Anguish in his own Breast in order to quiet her's.
               In the mean Time, Father Lorenzo wrote to Romeo all that had passed between him and Ju-lietta; he desired him to come the next Night, disguised, to Verona, and assist him in taking his Wife from the Tomb, and carry her with him to Mantua.
               
               This Letter he gave to a faithful Brother of the Order, strictly charging him to hasten with it to Mantua, and give it to Romeo Mon-tecchio, and no other Person whatever.
               The Friar accordingly departed for Mantua; and arriving there in good Time, alighted at the Convent of St. Francis, with an Intention to desire the Superior to let one of the Brothers accompany him into the City, where he had some Business to transact.
               It happened, that a Friar of that Con-vent was just then dead; and because it was suspected, from some Marks on his Body, that he died of the Plague, the Deputies of Health, the same Moment that the Veronese Friar ar-rived, came to the Superior, with Orders from the Lord of the City, that he should not suffer any one belonging to his Convent to stir

exhibited many Characters, in many Changes of Situation. These Cha-racters are so copiously diversified, and some of them so justly pursued, that his Works may be considered as a Map of Life, a faithful Miniature of human Transactions, and he that has read Shakespear with Attention, will perhaps find little new in the crouded World.
            Among his other Excellencies it ought to be remarked, because it has hitherto been unnoticed, that his Heroes are Men, that the Love and Hatred, the Hopes and Fears of his chief Personages are such as are com-mon to other human Beings, and not like those which later Times have exhibited, peculiar to Phantoms that strut upon the Stage.
            
               

out upon any Occasion whatever, for fear of spreading the Contagion.
               The Veronese Friar, in vain represented to the Deputies, that he was but just arrived from Verona, and had not yet spoke with any Person in the Convent; they obliged him to remain shut up with the other Friars, by which Means he could not deliver the Letter to Romeo himself, and would not, according to his Orders, send it by any other Person.
               While this passed at Mantua, in Verona they were making great Preparations for the Funeral Obsequies of Julietta, which, agreea-ble to the Custom of the Place, were to be performed the Day on which she died.
               
                  Pietro, the faithful Confident of Romeo, being then at Verona, and hearing that Julietta was dead, was almost out of his Wits for Grief; at first he was for going directly to Mantua, but upon Reflexion he resolved to stay till she was buried, that he might be able to say to his Master, he had really seen her dead. Julietta then was carried with great Pomp to the Mo-nument of the Capelletti, amidst the Sighs and Tears of all the Inhabitants of Verona. Pietro at this Sight was so lost in Affliction, re-flecting how ardently she was beloved by his Master, that he never thought of going to Father Lorenzo to consult with him, as he was accustomed; but, having seen Julietta en-tombed, he mounted his Horse, and rode hard, till he got to Villa-Franca, where he stopt to refresh himself, and after a short Sleep, rising two Hours before Day, he remounted his Horse, and reached Mantua at Sun-rise.
               
                  

                  Romeo was still in Bed, when he entered his Chamber; and poor Pietro was so much affected with the sad News he brought, that for some Moments he was unable to utter a Word; but his Sighs, and the Tears which ran down in great Abundance from his Eyes, persuaded his Master, that some ill Accident had happened, though he was far from gues-sing at the real one; yet with some Impati-ence, he asked him, "If his Father, and all his Friends at Verona were well" "Speak," added he, beginning to be more alarmed; find-ing he still continued silent and weeping, "Keep me no longer in Suspence, but tell me what is the Cause of that Affliction I see you in."
               
                  Pietro with a faultering Voice, then told him, that Julietta was dead, that he had seen her laid in the Monument of the Capelletti, and that it was reported in Verona, that Grief was the Cause of her Death.
               
                  Romeo, struck as with a Thunder-bolt at this dreadful News, remained for some Time in a speechless Agony of Grief; then furiously springing out of his Bed, "Ah Traitor! cried he aloud, cruel, perfidious and ingrateful Romeo, it was not Sorrow that killed thy Wife, Grief is not so quick a Murderer! Ah! no, it was thy Cruelty that killed her: Did she not tell thee in her Letters, she would dye rather than be the Wife of any other, and earnestly entreat thee to come, and take her from her Father's House, and thou, unworthy lingering Lover, amused her with vain Promises, but had not Resolution enough to perform them, and dost thou now

stand idly weeping, and Julietta dead!â€”Oh my Julietta! cried he, raising his Voice, art thou dead, and do I live!â€”Ah Wretch! how often have I told her, that I could not live without her, and yet I live, I breathe, and she is dead!â€”Where is she, added he, gaz-ing wildly round the Room, is she not here, here hovering about me, expecting me to fol-low her!â€”Hark; she calls me, behold, she says, behold me here, deceitful Lover and un-faithful Husband. Oh pardon me! my dearest Wife; I own my Guilt, and since Grief is not powerful enough to deprive me of Life; my own Hand shall perform that Office, and do what Grief is not able to do."â€”This said, he suddenly snatched his Sword from the Head of his Bed and turned the Point of it to his Bosom; but Pietro springing hastily to him pushed the Sword out of his Hand, endeavour-ing by all the soft Persuasions he was Master of to prevail upon him to change his dread-ful Purpose.
               
                  Romeo, overwhelmed with unutterable An-guish, stood silent and motionless all the Time he was speaking, resembling more a Marble Statue than a living Man; at last the stubborn Sorrow found a vent, and his Eyes, at once unlocking all their Springs, poured out a River of Tears.
               Though the Frenzy of his Sorrow was by this Means somewhat allayed, yet Despair had taken such Possession of his Soul, that he was fixed in his Resolution not to live, but care-fully concealing his Design, lest he should be prevented from executing it, he charged

                  Pietro, with a dissembled Calmness in his Looks and Voice, not to mention the Death of his Wife, and the fatal Error he had like to have been guilty of, to any Person whatever, but to mount a fresh Horse, and set out immediately for Verona, whither he would follow himâ€”"Let not my Father know, continued he, that I am coming, but provide me some Instruments for opening the Sepulchre, where my Julietta is interred, and wait for me at the Out-House behind our Garden; I will meet you there, and we will go together to the Monument of the Capelleti, for I must once more have a Sight of my dearest Wife, pale and cold as she now lies in Death, then early in the Morning I will return to Mantua, and you may follow a little Time after." Pietro, not suspecting his Intention, departed immediately to perform his Commission, and Romeo, as soon as he was gone, wrote a Letter to his Father, in which he entreated his Pardon for having married without asking his Consent, and related at large his Love for Juli-etta, their Marriage, and the fatal Consequen-ces; he conjured him also, since Julietta had been his Daughter to have perpetual Masses said for her Soul, and in order to reward the Fidelity of his Servant Pietro, he desired that a handsome Provision might be made for him out of the Estate which had been bequeathed him by an Aunt lately deceased, and since he had yet received no Part of it, he ordered the first Rents to be given to the Poor; having de-clared this to be his last Will, he earnestly en-treated his Father, to fulfil it in every particu-lar; then closing the Letter, he sealed it, and put

it in his Bosom. This done, he gave Orders to have a Horse made ready, and, telling his Ser-vants he would return the next Day, he put on the Habit of a German Soldier, and, taking with him a Phial full of Mortal Poison, he mounted his Horse, and took the Road to Verona. Having rode pretty fast, he arrived there in the Evening, and went to the House where he had appointed to meet Pietro, who having provided every Thing that he had been commanded, they went together at four o'Clock in the Morning to the Churchyard, which was in the Citadel, and got to the Monu-ment of the Capelletti without being discovered.
               The Vault being opened, without much Dif-ficulty, with the Instruments they had brought with them, they propt up the Top with Poles, and Romeo taking a dark Lanthorn, which Pietro had also provided, he descended into the Vault: Here he beheld his Wife dead as she appeared, and stretched out upon her Bier.
               
                  Romeo at this Sight fell fainting upon her Breast, and continued for some Moments in a Death more real than hers; recovering at last to a painful Sense of agonizing Woe, he took his Wife in his Arms, and holding her close prest to his Bosom, bathed her cold Face with his Tears, which flowed in such Abundance, that for a long Time he was not able to utter a Word; but when he recovered the Use of Speech, he broke into such moving Com-plaints, as might have softened the fiercest and most impenetrable Souls to Compassion. Con-tinuing still fixed in his Resolution to dye, he took the Phial out of his Pocket, and drank off the fatal Draught in a Moment, then ascend-ing

a few Steps, he called to Pietro, who was standing in a Corner of the Church-yard.â€” "Pietro, said he, when he approached, behold here my Wife, how much I did and do love her, thou partly knowest; thou knowest also, that it is as much impossible for me to live without her, as it is for a Body to live with-out a Soul; I therefore brought with me a Poison, which in less than half an Hour procures a certain Death; this I have glad-ly drank this Moment, that dying near her, whom in Life I so passionately adored, I may remain with her dead, since my cruel Destiny would not permit us to live together.â€” See, there is the Phial, which I have emptied, it was given me thou may'st remember by a Mountebank in Mantua, who came from Spoletta, and brought with him living Aspicks and other Serpents, the Water it contained was distilled from those Creatures and other Serpents. God of his infinite Mercy pardon me this Act, since I did not destroy myself to offend him, but because it was not possible for me to live without my dearest Wife.â€”Think not, Pietro, added he, wiping away the Tears that flowed from his Eyes, while he was speaking, think not because thou seest me weep, that I lament my Death at these early Years. No, my weeping proceeds from the Anguish I feel for the untimely Death of her, who was worthy of a much longer, and much more happy Life. Here, said he, pulling out the Letter, give this to my Father, it contains some particular Requests, which I have desired him to perform after my Death, as well con-cerning

my Interment in this Monument, as my Servants in Mantua, and you in particular: I am persuaded my Father will faithfully execute all I have required in this Letterâ€”Farewelâ€”I can no moreâ€”I feel al-ready the Approach of Deathâ€”The powerful Poison wanders through all my Limbs, and will shortly enter the last Retreat of Lifeâ€”I shall expire in half an Hourâ€”Take away the Props from the Vault, and leave me to breathe my Last in the Bosom of my adored Wife."
               
                  Pietro, at these Words of his Master, seemed to feel his Heart tore from his Breast; such was the Excess of his Sorrow: Fain he would have done something to assist him, but it was now in vain; there was no Remedy for that fatal Poison.
               
                  Romeo, descending again, took Julietta in his Arms, and after calling Pietro to close up the Vault, fixed his dying Lips on the Mouth of his Wife, and holding her fast folded to his Breast, waited for Death in that Posture.
               
                  Julietta, who had now digested the sleeping Powder, began to awake, and, her Senses, per-fectly returning, feeling herself fast embraced, she suspected the Friar was going to carry her to his Cell with some impure Design. Possest with this Thought, "Ah! Father Lorenzo, said she, is this the Fidelity you owe to Ro-meo? Do you thus abuse the Trust he reposed in you?" Endeavouring then to free herself from those suspected Embraces, and opening her Eyes at the same Time, she saw and knew

her Romeo, though disguised in the Habit of a German Soldier.
               "And are you here my Love, said she? Where is Father Lorenzo? Why don't you take me out of this Monument? Haste, let us go, I beseech you."
               
                  Romeo, when he saw her open her Eyes, and heard her speak, was sensible immediately that she was really alive, and feeling in the same Moment an Excess of Joy and Sorrow, he strained her eagerly to his Bosom, and weeping, cried, "Oh Life of my Life, and by far the dearest Part of me, what Man ever felt the extatic Joy I feel this Instant, which brings me the full Confirmation that thou art not dead but alive, and well in my Arms: But Oh! was ever Anguish equal to mine? at the same Time, since this happy, this mi-serable Moment, I feel myself going to be tore from thee by Death; now when Life would be most welcome to me; a quarter of an Hour is all the Time I can possibly live: Was there ever, Oh cruel Heaven! an Object at one and the same Moment, so exquisitely happy and so transcendantly miserable: How can I do otherwise than rejoice, my sweetest, my most lovely Wife, when I behold you living, whose sudden and unexpected Death I have so bitter-ly wept; but Oh my Sorrow is also extreme, that now, when Life would be dear to me, since, in possessing you, I have all for which I wish to live, now to be torn from you! How severe, how beyond Measure cruel, is my Destiny!"
               
                  

                  Julietta hearing Romeo speak in this Man-ner, being now quite awakened, repliedâ€” "What Words are these you speak to me, my dearest Lord; is this all the Comfort you intend to give me; and did you come from Mantua to bring me this fatal News?
               
                  Romeo then, in a few Words, telling her what he had done, and the Cause of itâ€” "Alas! alas! cried the miserable Julietta, what do I hear!â€”Oh what is it you tell me!â€” By what I understand then, Father Lorenzo did not write you an Account of the Measures he and I had taken, though he promised me faithfully to do so."
               Here Julietta, weeping sighing, and bit-terly complaining, amidst interrupting bursts of Sorrow, recounted all that the Friar and she had done to avoid being married to the young Nobleman her Father had provided for her.
               
                  Romeo, hearing this, felt his Grief and Ago-ny redoubled; and while Julietta with Heart-piercing Groans lamented their unhappy Fate, calling the Heavens, the Stars, and all the Elements most cruel and unmerciful, her dying Husband, observing the Corpse of Tibbald lying near him, turned towards itâ€”
               "Oh Tibbald, said he, if in thy present State thou art capable of knowing any Thing, thou must know that I sought not to offend thee; but that my Intention, by mixing in the Combat, was to persuade thy Party to retire, and mine to lay down their Arms; but thou, possessed by long hereditary Hatred against me, assaulted me cruelly with most untameable Ma-lice; then losing all Patience, I scorned to

move one Step to avoid thee, and thy ill Des-tiny made me kill thee: Now then I ask thee Pardon for that Offence; so much the greater, as thou wert then become my Kinsman by my Marriage with thy Cousin: If thou desirest Vengeance on me, behold the fatal Conse-quences of thy Death; could'st thou wish for a more compleat Revenge than that thy Mur-derer should here in thy Presence come to give himself a voluntary Death, and dying, seek a Corner of thy Sepulchre to remain interred be-side thee; so that, though in Life we were Ene-mies, yet in Death one Grave may hold us peaceably together."
               
                  Pietro, at this piteous Discourse of the dy-ing Husband, and the piercing Cries and bitter Complaints of the wretched Wife, stood mo-tionless with Horror and Grief, almost doubt-ing if the melancholy Scene he beheld was real; and not knowing what to say or do, re-mained fixed like a Statue on the Side of the Monument.
               "Oh, Romeo, said the exquisitely distressed Julietta, since it is not the Will of God that we should live together, I may at least be per-mitted to remain with you here; for Oh! be assured I will never, never forsake you."
               
                  Romeo then taking her in his Arms, began with the gentlest and most tender Soothings to calm her Sorrow, and persuade her to live, telling her he could not die in Peace, unless he was assured she would preserve her Life; but while he was speaking, he felt his Strength for-sake him by Degrees, his Eyes grew dim, and all the Powers of his Body so weakened, that

but when the chaise stopped at the door, she was near falling into a fainting fit; and her friend was obliged to ask if lady Meadows was at home, for Henrietta was not able to speak.
               The servant-maid who opened the door, hav-ing got a glympse of the young lady as she sat in the chaise, eagerly flew to the side of itâ€” "O my dear miss!" said she, in a transport of joy, "is it you?"
               "How do you do, Jenny?" said miss Cour-teney; and trembling, added, "is my aunt at home?"
               "My lady," said the girl,
set out two days ago for her seat in Devonshire. Oh! miss, here has been sad doings, poor Mrs. White is turned away; there came an ugly mischief-making lady from London, and told my lady a heap of stories about you, and so Mrs. White was turned away: but won't you please to alight, miss?
               
               Henrietta looked at Mrs. Willis, for she knew not herself what to resolve on, the news she had heard having thrown her into the utmost per-plexity â€” "I wish we could see Mrs. White," said Mrs. Willis to her in a whisper.
               Miss Courteney immediately enquired of the maid, how long Mrs. White had left her aunt, and where she was to be found? The girl told

thousands, shewed the utmost solicitude to asso-ciate plebean meanness in the honours of a noble ancestry, and to give title, rank, precedence, to one who would disgrace them all.

                  Henrietta returns to London.
               
               THE countess, who was greatly affected with the cruel usage Henrietta had re-ceived, could with difficulty restrain her tears when she entered the room where the fair pri-

                  oner was confined: that air of distinction which he had observed in her before she knew her 
                     â€¢
                  rth, seemed now more remarkable, and made

                  e humiliating condition to which she was re-
                  
                     â€¢
                  uced, a subject of painful reflection to lady â€”, 
                     â€¢
                  ho approached her with a look of tenderness and pity, and, taking her hand,
               
                  I scarce know how to speak to you (said she) about an affair that miss Cordwain has much more reason to be ashamed of than you. She has found her bracelet.
               
               Henrietta was a little surprised at the kind and 
                     â€¢
                  miliar manner in which the countess accosted

her; but still preserving that distant respect, which was due from the character she had as-sumed to a lady of her rank, she courtesied pro-foundly low, and thanked her for the honour she did her in condescending to bring this grateful piece of news herself.
               "I must tell you also," said the countess
that I am not ignorant of your name and fa-mily, nor of your motives for submitting to go to service; forwhich you deserve to be esteemed and admired by all the world. It was my so
                        â€¢
                      that betrayed your secret,
pursued the lady observing that Henrietta looked surprised;

                     
                        â€¢
                      will not ask you now how you came to intru

                        â€¢
                      interest I have in any way you shall desire.
               
               Henrietta, after making a proper acknowledg-ment for this kind declaration, told the counte
                     â€¢
                   that being determined to continue the way life she had entered into, till her relations themselves thought proper to alter it, the recom-mendation her ladyship had given her to 
                     
                   sister, was the greatest service she could poss
                     â€¢
                   desire, and would be ever most gratefully remem
                     â€¢
                  bered.
               
                  
"I admire your resolution," said the countess;
but I am grieved to think you should be in a situation so unworthy of you; something must be done to extricate you from it.
               
               "I beg, madam," said Henrietta,
that your ladyship's kind concern for me may not lead you to take any steps in my favour with my relations. No;
pursued she, with some warmth,
their unnatural behaviour to me de-serves the neglect I shew them, in not solicit-ing their assistance. I have already got over all those little passions and prejudices which might hinder me from being easy with my humble lot; and I freely confess to you, madam, that I find a secret pleasure in the thoughts of mortifying the pride of my lord â€”, when some accident (for an accident it must be) shall shew him his niece in the quality of a servant.
               
               "Consent at least," said the countess,
to my acquainting my sister with your birth, that she may endeavour to place you in such a manner as will be most agreeable to you.
               
               
                  I do not wish, madam, to be known to the person I serve,
replied Henrietta;
and I desire to have no other consideration shewn me than what my behaviour in the station I am placed in shall merit.
               
               
                  
"Well," said the countess,
it shall be as you would have it; but I cannot express to you how much I esteem and admire youâ€” You may judge of my good opinion of you, when I tell you, that as to what regards my son's passion for you, I depend entirely upon your candor and generosity. You know our views for him; and this is all I shall say.
               
               "I am obliged to you, madam," said Hen-rietta,
for the confidence you repose in me; I will endeavour to deserve it. And now, madam,
pursued she, smiling,
since my imprisonment is at an end, I will, with your ladyship's permission, set out immediately for London; the chaise I had hired is, I suppose, still waiting for me. I hope to have the ho-nour of presenting your letter to lady Câ€” to-morrow or next day at farthest.
               
               "Take my kindest wishes along with you," said the countess, kissing her, and taking a dia-mond ring from her finger:
wear this for my sake,
said she, giving it to Henrietta;
the intrinsick value of it is but small, but I hope you will consider it as a mark of my esteem for you.
               
               The countess went out of the room as soon as she had spoke these words, leave
                     â€¢â€¢
                   Henrietta extremely affected with her kindness: and all

obstacles to her journey being now removed, she hastened to the gate, placed herself in her post-chaise which she found waiting, and in a few moments was out of sight.
               Mean time, the countess returned to her com-pany, and told Mr. Cordwain, smiling, that he had nothing to fear from Henrietta's vindictive resolutions. Upon which, miss Cordwain said, she would go up to her, and make her an apo-logy for what had happened; but dinner was that moment served, which made it not necessary for the countess to tell her that Henrietta was gone, in order to prevent her intended civility: but as soon as a proper opportunity offered, she took care to let the young lady know, that her suspi-cions of Henrietta were very ill grounded; that she was perfectly, virtuous; and likely to remain in the obscure condition of a servant, unless her relations, who were persons of rank and fortune, thought proper to do something for her.
               She added, in order to remove all her uneasi-ness that she had recommended her to a lady who would procure her a place, which was the least she could do for a young woman of her birth, in such unhappy circumstances.
               Miss Cordwain was very well satisfied with what the countess had done; being persuaded,

that since she was so desirous the treaty between lord Bâ€” and her should go forward, that she would take care to hinder any thing from hap-pening on the part of Henrietta, that might give her cause for disgust.
               But poor lord Bâ€” was in a truly pitiable situation: he was in love with the person of Henrietta, and the fortune of miss Cordwain; and these different passions by turns equally pos-sessed him, so that it was impossible for him to form any fixed resolution.
               When he reflected on the solid advantages that would accrue to him from a marriage with the packer's daughter, such as being enabled to play as high at Arthur's as my lordâ€”, to bring as many race-horses to New-Market as â€”, to have as splendid equipages as the earl of â€”, and several others, which make the envy and emulation of many of our present race of nobles, he was ready to sacrifice his inclina-tions to motives so just, so reasonable, so meri-torious.
               But when the image of Henrietta rose to h
                     â€¢
                   thoughts; her person so lovely, her manners 
                     â€¢
                   elegant, her birth not beneath his own, her virtu
                     â€¢
                   so eminent; how could he think of putting su
                     â€¢
                   a treasure out of his reach, by marrying her de
                     â€¢
                  picable rival! And indeed, so just were his notio
                     â€¢
                  
                  

of this treasure, and so high his value of it, that, provided any method could be found to reconcile her to her aunt, and secure to her the succession of her estate, he would willingly have renounced his pretensions to miss Cordwain, and have mar-ried Henrietta; though her fortune, as heiress of lady Meadows's estate, would be some thousands less than miss Cordwain's.
               Such a proof of disinterestedness, he thought, must needs be very grateful to a young woman of Henrietta's fine understanding and enlarged sen-timents; and, having brought himself to this point, his next care was to procure a private in-terview with her, that he might acquaint her with his designs, and engage her concurrence with them.
               But this scheme being defeated by her sudden departure, which he learned from his mother, he was plunged into new perplexity and uneasi-ness. He asked the countess, with an air of in-difference and unconcern, where she was gone, and how she intended to dispose of herself? But that discerning lady, who observed his sudden e-motion at the news of Henrietta's departure, would give him no other satisfaction than telling him, that she supposed she would again go to service; for she seemed to have no expec-tations of any savour from her relations.
               
                  
Lord Bâ€”, after a little reflection, com-forted himself with a hope, that some accident or other would again throw her in his way; and that the disgust she must necessarily entertain, to a way of life so unworthy of her, would induce her to embrace his honourable proposals: for such he conceived them to be, since all the sacri-fice he should expect from her, was a tempo-rary compliance with her aunt's inclinations with regard to religion: but however, he thought it would be prudent not to break, off with miss Cord-wain, because in her fortune he would always find wherewithal to comfort himself, if he was disappointed in his love.
               In pursuance of this wise resolution, he be-haved in such a manner to that young lady, as gave her no cause to be displeased with him; so that every thing in this noble family, and their designed allies, was upon the same footing as be-fore Henrietta, with mischief-making beauty, came in the way.

                     A match for nothingâ€” but the Deity.
                  
                  YOUNG'S UNIVERSAL PASSION.
               
               MEAN time our fair heroine, having per-formed her little journey without any un-fortunate accident, arrived late in the evening at the house of her friend Mrs. Willis, who, in her astonishment at her sudden return, asked her a hundred questions in a breath.
               Henrietta satisfied her eager curiosity with a succinct detail of all that had happened to

her that day, which had indeed been a very busy one.
               The honest heart of Mrs. Willis was variously affected with the different parts of her storyâ–ª She wept for her sufferings: she execrated the malicious miss Cordwain; she praised the coun-tess; and was exceedingly solicitous about the purport of lord Bâ€”'s designs, which, from what she had heard of his behaviour, appeared to her very mysterious. But Henrietta, who had a thorough contempt for that young lord, declared, that although he should break with miss Cordwain, and address her upon honoura-ble terms, yet she could not bring her 
                     
                   to approve of him.
               
                  He is mean (said she) and sordid in his temper. His principles are bad: he is a lord, but he is not a gentleman; and I am sure I could never esteem him. Besides the coun-tess, who is more alarmed about the senti-ments he has for me than I think she has rea-son, depends upon my honour not to encou-rage any overtures from him, and I will not abuse her confidence.
               
               
                  It is easy (pursued she, smiling) to be just when our own inclinations do not oppose it. I shall pretend to no merit in making this sa-crifice, if ever it be in my power to make it;

her she had been gone above a week, and that she believed she was at her sister's in Windsor, Henrietta had often heard her mention her sister, who was married to a tradesman in Windsor; and, after she had taken leave of the poor affec-tionate girl, who wept to see her depart again, she gave the post-boy directions where to drive.
               Mrs. White, when the chaise stopped at the door, heard from a little parlour where she was sitting, the voice of miss Courteney, enquiring for her, and flew with trembling eagerness to meet her.
               "Oh! miss," said she, taking her hand, and leading her into the room,
I am rejoiced to see you: where have you been all this time â€”What an unfortunate creature was I to be the means of your taking such a rash resolu-tion â€” Oh! that I had kept what I knew to myselfâ€” But surely, it was very unkind in you not to acquaint me with your design, not to ask my advice. I might have prevented all this trouble; but thank Heaven you are safe and wellâ€”well I see you are.
               
               Henrietta then interrupting the good woman, who, between chiding and fondness, had taken no notice of Mrs. Willis:
That I am safe (said she) I am obliged to this gentlewoman;

because in reality it will not be a great one. If riches and splendor could have made me happy, I would have married sir Isaac Darby; for it was not his age that I objected to most, but those qualities and manners which made his age contemptible.
               
               "But, surely, my dear," said Mrs. Willis,
your gratitude would be engaged, should lord Bâ€”, in the present inequality of your cir-cumstances, make you an offer of his hand.
               
               "Not at all," replied Henrietta, with some warmth:
no man has a right to the love or esteem of a woman on whom he has enter-tained dishonourable designs, and, failing in them, offers marriage at last. The lover, who marries his mistress only because he can-not gain her upon easier terms, has just as much generosity as the highwayman who leaves a traveller in possession of his money, because he is not able to take it from him.
               
               "Well, well, my dear miss," said Mrs. Willis, smiling,
I can collect this at least from the nice distinctions you make, that your heart is absolutely free; you would not reason so well, were there any secret passion in the case.
               
               
                  
"Surely," replied Henrietta,
you do not imagine that I should become less delicate in my notions for being in love: that passion, like some plants, derives its qualities from the soil it grows in; for instance, in lord Bâ€”, it is mean, selfish, wavering.
               
               "And what would it be in you?" interrupted Mrs. Willis.
               "Ah! no matter," cried Henrietta:
I am not in love yet, and never will by with a man who has such sentiments as lord Bâ€”; he had best be constant to miss Cordwain. Ple-bean lords and the nobility of the shop and warehouse are equal matches.
               
               To this remark Mrs. Willis, who was pleased with the vivacity of her fair friendâ–ª assented only with a smile: for supper was now placed upon the table; and, as she knew Henrietta had not dined, she was extremely solicitous to make her eat, and with the same maternal fondness hur-ried her soon to bed, that she might recover the fatigue she had suffered during the day.
               The next morning at eleven o clock, our fair heroine set out in an hackney-
                     â€¢â€¢
                  ach for â€” square, where lady Dâ€” h
                     â€¢â€¢
                  d, to whom she was to deliver the recommendatory letter which the countess had given her.
               
                  
The lady was at her toilet when she read her sister's letter, which Henrietta had sent in to her, and immediately ordered her admittance. Surprised at the elegant figure which met her eyes in the glass upon our fair heroine's entering the room, she hastily turned her head, and gazed on Henrietta so intently, that she blushed; which lady Dâ€” observing, obligingly desired her to sit down, and said, she would talk to her presently.
               Henrietta modestly placed herself at a distance, but so luckily for the lady's curiosity, that she could have a full view of her in her glass, with-out renewing her confusion.
               "My sister," said lady Dâ€”, breaking si-lence at last,
has mentioned you very advan-tageously, Mrs. Benson, I wish it may be in my power to serve you.
               
               Henrietta bowed respectfully.
               "You are very young," pursued the lady;
I suppose miss Cordwain's was the first service you ever lived in?
               
               At the word Service Henrietta blushed again; and indeed the lady did not pronounce it with-out some hesitation, for having a sensible and ingenuous mind, she felt the impropriety of the term when used towards a person, who, not-withstanding

the humility of her deportment, had a dignity in her looks and air, which com-manded respect. She took notice of this emo-tion, and the more because she saw it endea-voured to be suppressed; and being desirous of gaining some further knowledge of her, she asked her a hundred little questions, which she thought would lead her to an explanation of her circum-stances.
               Henrietta avoided making a discovery of her-self, but answered in such a manner, as, with-out satisfying the lady's curiosity, gave her a very good opinion of her candor and her sense: but she was particularly struck with the graceful ease with which she talked; and observed such a perfect politeness in her manners, as persuaded her she was born in a much higher rank than her present situation allowed the probability of.
               Lady Dâ€”'s daughter now entered the room, and asked her mamma, if she desired to hear her take a lesson from her singing-master that morning?
               The lady ordered the master to be admitted, upon which Henrietta rose up to go away; but the lady told her, with a benevolent smile, that she should stay and hear miss Dâ€”perform, and desired her to resume her seat.
               
                  
While the young lady was singing, lady Dâ€” kept her eyes fixed on Henrietta's face, and, from the sweet expression in it, collecting that she had a taste for musick, asked her, if she had ever been taught?
               Henrietta, though not willing to make a dis-play of talents which were not necessary to her present condition, yet owned, that she had a little knowledge of musick.
               Lady Dâ€” immediately desired to hear her sing, and the young lady at the same time pre-senting her guitar to her, she was obliged to comply. Her air, her attitude, the exquisite grace with which she touched the little instru-ment, the sweetness of her voice, and the sen-sibility in her fine eyes, charmed lady Dâ€”, who was an enthusiastick admirer of the art, so that she cried out in a kind of transport,
Mr. Minime! would you not be proud of such a scholar?
               
               "Madam," said the master, bowing,
the young gentlewoman has a very pretty voice and manner, to be sure: but if miss Dâ€” applies closely to musick for seven or eight years longer, and does not suffer her mind to be distracted with the study of other sciences, I shall have more reason to be proud of my scholar than any master in the world.
               
               
                  
This speech forced a smile from Henrietta, who the third time rose up to be gone, upon hearing a female visiter announced; but lady Dâ€”, conceiving that she was not obliged to a strict observation of ceremony with the per-son that was now entering, again insisted upon Henrietta's staying, telling her, she had thought of something for her; and that she would ac-quaint her with it as soon as the lady was gone.
               Henrietta had but just time to express a grate-ful acknowledgment of her kindness, when the visiter was introduced. She was a woman or a mean aspect, but had a great deal of self-sufficiency in her air. After the usual compli-ments were over, she threw herself into an easy chair, and examined Henrietta with such extreme attention, that she blushed.
               The lady, who took consequence to herself from the power of throwing on ingenuous mind into confusion, finding that Henrietta was op-pressed by her looks, gazed at her the more ear-nestly: and having indulged herself several mi-nutes in this exertion of her superiority, thought it was now time to make the poor bashful girl stare in her turn, and began to display her wit and learning; the former in an inundation of

words that swallowed up her meaning, and the latter in French words and phrases, brought in to supply the deficiencies of her own native tongue.
               Lady Dâ€”, who was used to divert herself with the singularity of this woman's character, listened to her with complaisance. But Hen-rietta, who began to conceive a very mean opi-nion of a lady who seemed to value herself so highly upon the knowledge of a language, which was now become a part of every cobler's daugh-ter's education, beheld her with an indifference that sensibly wounded her pride, and made her have recourse to other methods to impress her prodigious consequence upon her; and since she could not make her stare at her learning, she was resolved to make her wonder at her principles.
               
                  You know, lady Dâ€” (said she abruptly) I do not often go to church.
               
               "I know it, and I am sorry for it," replied her ladyship.
               
                  Upon my word (said she) I have too much reverence for the Deity to go to a place where it is ten to one but I shall hear him blas-phemed.
               
               
                  
Henrietta now began to stare indeed. The wonderful lady proceeded,
               
                  I never pretend to deny that I am a deist.
               
               "You must pardon me, Mrs. â€”," in-terrupted lady Dâ€”,
if I tell you that I really think you often declare that very impro-perly; I have heard you say so before your children and servants.
               
               "Madam," replied Mrs. â€”
I take care that my servants shall not think me an atheist. They know my principles better: they know I am a deist; they have heard me declare that I believe there is an Intelligent cause which governs the world by physical rules. As for moral attributes, there is no such thing; it is impious and absurd to sup-pose it. The arbitrary constitution of things in the human system produces happiness and misery; that is to say, misery and happiness is productive ofâ€”Or rather, as I said before, the arbitrary constitution of things, vice and virtue, is necessarily produced byâ€”that is, necessarily brings on happiness or misery.â€” Prayer, and such like artifices of religion, is foolish: for whatever is, is right. To talk of imitating God, is blasphemy. His Provi-dence is extended to collective bodies only;

he has no regard to individuals: nor is the soul a distinct substance from the body. There is no future state; it is all a fiction. To argue from unequal distributions is absurd and blas-phemous. Whatever is, is best. The law of nature is sufficiently clear; and there is no need of any supernatural revelation.
               
               "I must intreat you, madam," interrupted lady Dâ€”, seeing her eldest daughter that moment enter the room,
to change the dis-course now, miss has not been used to such deep reasoning on these aweful subjects, and may perhaps mistake what you are saying for blasphemy.
               
               
                  More absurd mistakes than that may be made, madam,
replied Mrs. â€”,
when persons are not allowed to exercise their men-tal facultiesâ€” but your ladyship is going to dressâ€”I interrupt you.
Saying this, she rose "up, and lady Dâ€” making no efforts to de-tain her, took her leave.
               "I have always hated that woman," said miss Dâ€”, as soon as she was gone,
ever since I heard her ridicule parental affection, and call it brutual instinct.
               
               "Oh," said lady Dâ€”, laughing,
it would ill become one of her elevated under-standing, to have natural affections: those she

treats as vulgar prejudices. Her own sex are the objects of her scorn, because they are sub-ject to such weaknesses as tenderness and pity. She reads Seneca on friendship in the morn-ing; and exclaims, O the exalted passion! how divinely he treats it! what noble senti-ments! In the afternoon she over-reaches her friend, and applauds her own wisdom. Epic-tetus is studied with great care. She will preach a moral sermon out of Epictetus that will last two hours. Epictetus teaches her to regulate her passions. She reads him in-tently while her maid is combing her hair, and closes her book to storm at the poor trembling creature for accidentally hurting her with the comb.
               
            
            
               

for some strange treachery was preparing for me, I believe, but her care has prevented it.
               
               "Treachery!" interrupted Mrs. Whiteâ€”
Aye, you have met with enough of that, I suppose: there was your new-found friend and acquaintance, missâ€”I forget her name, whom you told all your secrets to; you made no scruple to trust her, miss, though you was so reserved to me; she was the occasion of my losing my place. Ah! miss, but I will not upbraid you; I see you are concerned: God forbid I should add to your uneasiness; I have suffered greatly upon your account. It was very unkind in you to put it in the power of a stranger to do me so much mischief: surely I did not deserve such a return from you. But God knows my heart, I would not upbraid you for the world; no, I scorn it; but I have been the greatest sufferer, I am sure, and yet I meant well.
               
               "Was not the lady's name Woodby?" in-terrupted Henrietta, impatient to hear the par-ticulars of this new act of treachery and base-ness.
               "Aye, Woodby," replied Mrs. White,
a disagreeable creature as ever my eyes beheld. I shall never forget how she sidled into my lady's dressing-room, and, half out of breath,

               CHAP. II.
               
                  In which Henrietta makes a very fantastick distinction.
               
               HEnrietta could not help smiling at lady Dâ€”'s satirical manner of exposing the follies of the lady who had just left the room: but a female free-thinker was, in her opinion, so shocking a character, that she would much rather have seen it the object of abhorrence than mirth.
               Lady Dâ€” put an end to her reflections: for, turning towards her,
Mrs. Benson (said she) it is time to think of you now.
Hen-rietta immediately rose from her seat.
               "There is a lady of my acquaintance," pur-sued lady Dâ€”,
to whom your accomplish-ments of singing and playing will make you a very acceptable companion: and indeed I think it is a pity a young woman of your ap-pearance and genteel education should remain in the condition of a servant, which I am per-suaded you was not born to.
               
               
                  
Henrietta blushed; which lady Dâ€” ob-serving, "come," said she, smiling,
be in-genuous, and confess that the proposal I have made you will suit you better than being a servant.
               
               "Indeed, madam, it does not," replied Hen-rietta;
I am extremely obliged to your lady-ship for your kind intentions, but I had rather be recommended to the lady as a servant than in any other character.
               
               "You surprise me," said lady Dâ€”, after a little pause;
what objections can you have to a situation so much to be preferred to servitude?
               
               "I am very sure, madam," said Henrietta,
that I have not too much pride to be a ser-vant, since it is necessary I should be one: but I am afraid I cannot so easily 
                        
                      a dependent.
               
               Lady Dâ€”, a little disappointed to find herself so far below this obscure young person in delicacy of sentiment, answered gravely,
               
                  Well, since it must be so, I will serve you in your own way; let me see you again a few days hence, by that time I may possibly have heard of something for you.
               
               
                  
Henrietta again politely thanked her ladyship, and withdrew, leaving lady Dâ€” and her daughter differently affected with her behaviour in this last instance: for young minds are apt to be struck with uncommon sentiments, and to admire such as seem to possess them; while persons advanced in years, either from experi-ence of the world, or the natural depravity of the human heart, ascribe every thing to affecta-tion and design, that contradicts certain received maxims in life.
               However, Henrietta's peculiarity made lady Dâ€” extremely desirous to know who she was, and whether there was any thing extraor-dinary in her circumstances. She wrote to the countess her sister, expressing her curiosity: but that lady was resolved to keep Henrietta's secret, as well in regard to the promise she had given her, as because she really thought an unseason-able discovery of her true name and family would be disadvantageous to the plan she had laid.
               She therefore contented herself with telling her sister, in her answer, that Mrs. Benson was a very deserving young woman, who had been well brought up, but, by misfortunes in her fa-mily, reduced to go to service.
               
                  
Lady Dâ€” was satisfied with this account; and when Henrietta, in obedience to her com-mands, waited on her again, she received her with great benevolence; told her, she had re-commended her to a lady of great fortune, whose place she believed would be an advan-tageous one; and ordered her own woman to go with a message to the lady, and introduce her.
               Henrietta having a hackney-coach waiting, lady Dâ€”'s woman and her, after some cere-monies which our fair heroine would gladly have dispensed with, seated themselves in it; and, as soon as it drove from the door, the Abi-gail began,
               
                  Well, madam, you are certainly very for-tunate, Mrs. Autumn's place is one of the best in Christendom: you have nothing to do but to flatter her, and you will gain her heart for ever.
               
               "Is the lady fond of flattery then?" said Henrietta.
               "Oh! immensely," cried the other;
but for fear you should mistake, and compliment her in the wrong place, you must know (and I think it is very lucky that I had an oppor-tunity of instructing you) you must know that though she is between forty and fifty years of

age, she affects to be thought extremely young; and having been handsome in her youth, as my lady says, she forgets she is no longer so now she is old.
               
               
                  Now, dear madam, this is your cue. Be sure to praise her bloomy complexion, and the brightness of her eyes; and, if she bids you guess how old she is, as 'tis ten to one but she will some time hence, don't exceed twenty years, I charge you.
               
               
                  The poor simple girl that lived with her last, lost her place, by saying, when she asked her how old she believed her to be, that she took her ladyship to be about the same age as her mother. She was a vulgar creature, to be sure. You, madam, are in no danger of speaking so improperly. But on certain occasions you may contradict her rudely, and she will be the more pleased; as for instance, when she says she looks horridly! tell her in a surly way, as if you were vexed at her perverseness, that you never saw her look so handsome.
               
               "Mighty well," said Henrietta, smiling,
I perceive you are excellent in this art; I amâ€”
               
               
                  
"Oh! no thanks, dear madam," interrupted lady Dâ€”'s woman,
I am fond of doing good offices.
               
               "I was going to say," replied Henrietta,
that I am afraid these wise documents will be thrown away upon me.
               
               "I hope not," said the other, gravely.
Come, take courage, you are but a young be-ginner; these things come of 
                        
                      I should be sorry you were not capable of taking good counsel.
               
               They were now arrived at Mrs. Autumn's house: lady Dâ€”'s woman sent up word, that she was come with the person her lady had re-commended to her ladyship; upon which both were ordered to go up stairs.
               They found the lady giving audience to millener, a mantua-maker, and a mercer. Se-veral pieces of silk lay unrolled before he and a vast variety of ribbons, lappets, egret
                     â€¢
                   and other fashionable trifles, were spread upo
                     â€¢
                   a table, on which she leaned, in a thoughtful posture, as unable to determine her choice.
               When Henrietta and her companion entere
                     â€¢
                   she raised her eyes, and nodding familiarly lady Dâ€”'s woman, who approached he
                     â€¢
                   courtsying;
you find me excessively busy, M
                        â€¢
                      Echo (said she) well, what has lady Dâ€”

sent meâ€”Oh! a good-likely body,
pursued she, looking at Henrietta;
my compliments, Mrs. Echo, and thanksâ€”You see I have hardly time to speak to youâ€”The young woman may stay, I'll talk to her presently.
               
               Mrs. Echo withdrew; and the lady resuming her contemplative posture, gave Henrietta an opportunity of considering her at leisure.
               If lady Dâ€”'s woman had not fixed her age at somewhat more than forty, she would have con-cluded her to have been older, by the deep furrows in her face, her fallen cheeks, and the poor shri-vell'd hand that supported her head: but her dress spoke her scarce fifteen; a French fillet supplied the place of a cap, and served to bind the few straggling hairs that graced her tem-ples, to a tÃ¨te, which was so loaded with hair, that her head seemed to be of an enormous size. The rest of her dress was suited exactly to the childish ornaments of her head; and though no object could be more ridiculous, yet Henrietta beheld her with a serious concern; for, true benevolence compassionates those follies which unfeeling hearts sacrifice to mirth.
               Mrs. Autumn at length rose up;
that must be the thing,
said she, pointing to a pink and silver. She then gave some directions to her millener; and, suddenly interrupting herself,

turned with a lively air to the mercer, and asked him, why he had not cut off the silk?
               
                  Your ladyship did not tell me how much you wanted,
replied the tradesman.
               "Lord! I am the giddiest creature," ex-claimed Mrs. Autumn. This matter however was soon settled, and the important business with the millener dispatched, she dismissed her trades-people, and, throwing herself with an af-fected air upon a settee, ordered Henrietta to come forward.
               
                  I was afraid (said she) that lady Dâ€”, who is very fond of seeing grave solemn faces about her, had sent me some antiquated crea-ture that would have frightened me; but you seem to be a sprightly young body: we shall agree very well, I hope.
               
               Henrietta courtesied.
               "I hate old people," pursued the lady;
they are generally obstinate and surly. God help us, we shall all be old if we liveâ€”but when one is in years one's self it is time enough to be plagued with the humours of those that are
                        â€¢
                      you will suit me extremely well.
               
               Henrietta courtesied again.
               "You are no talker, I find," said Mrs. Au-tumn, a little chagrined that the hints she had thrown out, had produced nothing which could

flatter her extreme desire of being thought young.
Well, there is no great harm in that; I shall take you upon lady Dâ€”'s recommendation. As for termsâ€”
               
               "Madam," said Henrietta, who now for the first time opened her mouth;
they shall be whatever you think proper.
               
               "Very well," said the lady,
we will talk no more about them then; if you can find out how to please me, which will be no dif-ficult matter I assure you, my place may prove a very advantageous one, and the sooner you come the better.
               
               Henrietta told her, she was ready to come whenever she pleased. Upon which, Mrs. Au-tumn, with the pretty impatience of youth, asked her, if it would be any inconvenience to her to come that very night?
               Henrietta, who was naturally obliging, as-sured her it would not; and was dismissed with a gracious smile for her ready compliance.
               Mrs, Willis, who had flattered herself that she should enjoy the company of her amiable friend for a few weeks at least, was greatly dis-appointed when she found she was to lose her 
                     â€¢
                  o soon; and gently blamed her for being so pre-
                  
                     â€¢â€¢
                  pitate.
               
                  
Henrietta gave her the character of the lady she was going to live with, and repeated what she had said to her.
You may be sure (added she) that I shall never please Mrs. Autumn in the way she expects to be pleased. Flattery is always mean; but to flatter solly, is, in my opinion, criminal. However, I gladly em-braced the first opportunity that offered to shew my willingness to oblige, though I would not flatter her. You will hardly believe me, perhaps (said she, smiling) when I tell you, that one of the greatest bars to my happiness in my present humble situation is, the dif-ficulty of pleasing without wounding my own delicacy and candor. It is not easy to live well with our superiors, and preserve our in-tegrity, but it is not impossible; and, if fail in that attempt, I shall at least have this satisfaction, that I suffer in the cause 
                        
                      virtue.
               
               
                  It requires all that sweetness of temp
                        â€¢
                      which you possess,
said Mrs. Willis,

                        â€¢
                      What an absurdity! at fifty years to expect 
                        â€¢
                      be thought young; and to imagine that, 
                        â€¢
                      affecting the follies of youth, she shall ha

told her, she had taken the liberty to wait on her to bring her some news of her niece. I could not hear distinctly all she said, for my lady ordered me to withdraw; but I put my ear to the key-hole, as I had done once be-fore for your service miss, which I have rea-son to repent, Heaven knowsâ€” but what is past cannot be helpedâ€” it is not my way to rip up things that are past.
               
               "Well," said Henrietta,
but what did you hear?
               
               "Nay, for that matter," resumed Mrs. White,
I may draw myself into another prem
                           â€¢â€¢
                        e per-haps: after what I have suffered I ought to be cautious; but I love you, miss, and must tell you every thing, whatever it cost me, and that you have experienced already. Well, she made up a horrible story, that you had gone away suddenly from lodgings where she visited you, and notwithstanding the friendship there was between you, and a great clutter she made with that word, you went away without giv-ing her any notice of your intention; and this she said had a strange appearance.
               
               Miss Courteney lifted up her eyes here, in astonishment at what she heard.
               "As for me," continued Mrs. White,
she did my business in an instant; for as soon as she

preached with never cultivating our minds till we can no longer please by our persons; but here is a woman who has not judgment e-nough to know when she ought to resign the hope of pleasing by her person. Take my word for it, you will be very unhappy with her, unless you resolve to accommodate your-self to her humour, and sooth her in her ridi-culous folly.
               
               "That I will not do," replied Henrietta;
and since I have learned not to fear poverty, my happiness will never depend upon others.
               
               Mrs. Willis, finding she could not prevail with her fair friend to alter her resolution, ac-quiesced in it at length; and Henrietta, taking an affectionate leave of her, repaired to her new habitation.
            
            
               

               CHAP. III.
               
                  Which shews Henrietta in her new service, where she acquits herself extremely ill.
               
               THE lady being engaged with company when Henrietta arrived, she did not see her till late at night, when she was summoned to undress her.
               "Come hither, Henrietta," said she, as soon as she entered the room;
I have seen lady Dâ€” since you was hereâ€”She has given me such an advantageous account of your under-standing, that I am resolved to make you my confidant.
               
               At the word Confidant Henrietta looked a little confused; but the lady, who did not ob-serve her emotion, reclined her head upon her hand, and, fixing her eyes on her glass to see how this pensive attitude became her.
               
                  I am certainly (pursued she, sighing) the most unfortunate woman in the worldâ€”Ben-son, if you would be happy, never marry.
               
               
                  I have no thought of marriage at present, madam,
said Henrietta.
               
                  
"Ah, how I envy your freedom," said the antiquated fair;
you are plagued with no un-reasonable jealousy. Benson, you will not be here long before you are a witness to my per-secutions. I wish I could conceal them, but that is impossible.
               
               "I am sorry, madam," said Henrietta, who was under a necessity of saying something in an-swer to this strange stuff,
to hear that you have any thing to make you uneasy.
               
               "It does not signify," exclaimed the lady, with an emotion which she herself took to be real;
I shall be choaked if I don't speak; may I depend upon your prudence, Benson!â€”But I know I may. Well then, you must know there is a poor young fellow who pretendsâ€” But why do I say pretendsâ€”who is despe-rately â€”what shall I call itâ€”who has an un-conquerable, invincible, hopeless, fatal, dying passion forâ€”for me, in short. Is not this a shocking thing?
               
               "Indeed! madam," replied Henrietta, with great truth, "I pity you extremely."
               "Ay, am I not greatly to be pitied, child?" said the lady.
Then the poor wretch cannot conceal his solly; and it makes Mr. Autumn so uneasy, that really his temper is intolera-ble.
               
               
                  
"Pardon me, madam," said Henrietta;
but I am not surprised that Mr. Autumn is uneasy at such folly as you justly call it.
               
               "Why, to be sure it is folly," said Mrs. Au-tum:
but then, if one reflects a littleâ€” It is not folly neitherâ€” for love, you know, is an involuntary passion. So thatâ€” but you have a very unfeeling heart, Benson; and yet, to judge by your looks, you should have great sensibility. Pray, have you never felt the tender passion?
               
               "If you mean love, madam," replied Hen-rietta; "indeed I cannot say I have."
               "Well, you will be a happy creature," said the lady, sighing,
if you can always main-tain this indifference: but poor Languish must not expect to meet with much compassion from you. Poor wretch! (continued she, laughing) I cannot help triumphing a little. I have nick-named him Languish from his eternal sighing, and the melancholy roll of his eyes. Mr. Autumn cannot endure to hear me call him by this name; but I love to plague him a little now and then: what sig-nifies power, if one does not shew one has it. Yet he ought to be satisfied with me for what I did this evening, when Languish indiscreetly betrayed the violence of his passion, by ea-gerly

running (though there were two gen-tlemen nearer) to take up my glove which I had dropped: I took no notice of the dying air with which he presented it to me; but, as if his touch had polluted it, I received it haughtily from him, and threw it aside. Sure this instance of disdain was enough to satisfy a jealous husband; yet mine, instead of looking pleased, coloured with jealousy and rage, and gave me such furious glances: however, this will always be the case, where there is so great a disproportion in age; Mr. Autumn is not less than forty. But hey day! is the girl asleep?
continued she, looking at Henrietta, who stood fixed in thought; for the absurd affectation of her mistress gave her matter enough for reflection.
Come, un-dress me; Mr. Autumn will wonder at my long stay, and as he is ingenious in torment-ing himself, he will possibly suspect that I have been reading a letter from this rival of his; but there he over-rates his presumption, he has not ventured to write to me yet, his passion is only expressed in sighs and looks.
               
               Henrietta made haste to obey her, her patience being almost exhausted; for Mrs. Autumn had got on a subject which she knew not how to quit, and her women being the only persons to whom she

could utter these extravagancies, without any danger of being mortified with sarcastick hints of age, and such envious and unjust reflections, she made herself amends with them, for the reserve she was much against her will obliged to maintain with others.
               Henrietta was at length ordered to wait on her to her chamber, and soon after retired to her own, greatly out of humour with her mistress, and not a little displeased at herself, to find that her philosophy, by which she was enabled to bear the change of her fortune with patience and resignation, could not guard her against 
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  ful-ness and disgust at the follies she was 
                     â€¢
                  eed to be witness to.
               Mrs. Autumn, like other modern 
                     
                  , lay in bed always till it was very late this being one of those happy expedients for killing time (as the fashionable phrase is) which, to discover, employs the inventions of persons of rank and fortune. Henrietta had attended three whole hours in her lady's dressing-room, in expectation every moment of being summoned to assist her to rise, when Mr. Autumn at length entered the room.
               His servant, while he was dressing him, had told him, that his lady's new woman, whom he had a glympse of as he passed by her on the stairs,

was the greatest beauty he ever beheld; so that being curious to see her, he came to breakfast with his wife that morning.
               Henrietta rose up at his entrance; Mr. Autumn bowed, looked at her attentively, and thought his man had taste. But he was still more struck with her noble air than the charms of her face, and felt an uneasy emotion when he saw her continue standing, with that humble respect, which, although it became her situation, seemed little suited to the dignity of her appearance.
Is not Mrs. Autumn up, madam?
said he, not being able to forbear using that respectful style. Henrietta, suppo-sing he did not know her rank in his family, re-plied,
               
                  I expect my lady will ring every moment, sir.
               
               
                  Pray let her know that I am come to break-fast with her,
said Mr. Autumn.
               Henrietta went immediately into her lady's chamber, and, finding her awake, delivered her message.
               "Lord bless me!" said Mrs. Autumn,
what new whim is this? He does not use to invade my apartment in a morning: I suppose he is come to teaze me with some of his jealous fancies. Well, since it must be so, order

breakfast to be sent in, and come to me di-rectly.
               
               What a ridiculous woman is this, thought Henrietta,, as she went out of the room, to tor-ment, herself at her age with the notion of her husband being jealous of her.
               The good lady, when she returned, charged her not to leave the room while they were at breakfast.
Your presence (said she) may per-haps be some restraint upon him.
               
               She then slipped on a night-gown, and went in a frightful dishabille to attend her complaisant spouse; for she was one of those ladies who dress for every body but their husbands.
               Henrietta was not sorry that she was directed to wait, for she was extremely desirous of know-ing whether her lady had any reason for the uneasiness she expressed. Mr. Autumn's good humour and complaisance soon put that matter out of doubt; but Mrs. Autumn was resolved to persuade her maid that her husband was jealous, and laughing affectedly, cried,
               
                  Well, don't be chagrined, Mr. Autumn, but I protest I dreamt of poor Languish last night.
               
               The husband shook his head, winked at his wise, and pointed to Henrietta, as if he had

said, don't expose yourself before your new ser-vant.
               "Why, how you frown now!" pursued Mrs. Autumn;
I knew you would be angry. Lord! what does it signify of whom one dreams: one does not always think of the persons one dreams of. I wish I had not told you.
               
               "I wish you had not," said Mr. Autumn, biting his lip with vexation at her folly. The lady then lowering her voice, as if she was not willing to be heard by Henrietta, tho' she took care not to make it impossible, repeated,

                     "Trifles, light as air,
                     "Are to the jealous, confirmations strong
                     "As proofs of holy writ."
                  
               
               "You are well read in Shakespear, madam," said Mr. Autumn, who was willing to give an-other turn to the discourse.
               "Oh!" exclaimed she,
he has touched the passion of jealousy finely in his character of Othello; I think the Moor was uneasy about a dream too.
               
               Just then somebody tapped at the door, Hen-rietta opened it; one of the footmen delivered a message from one lady, enquiring how Mrs. Au-tumn did, and a sealed-up card from another.
               
                  
While the servant was speaking, Mrs. Au-tumn called out, what makes the fellow whisper in that manner, as if the message he brings was a secret? Henrietta delivered her the card, which she threw upon the table without open-ing it.
I am resolved (said she) to turn that blockhead away; his mysterious manner is enough to put strange fancies into people's heads.
               
               "The strange fancies are all your own," said Mr. Autumn, peevishly.
               "I thought it would be so," cried the lady,
you are out of humour. What is this sealed up card the grievance? come, we will open it, and you shall know the contents.
               
               "Indeed I will not," said Mr. Autumn rising;
I have not the least curiosity about the con-tentsâ€”Good morning to you, my dear, I am going out.
               
               "Well, Benson," said Mrs. Autumn, as soon as her husband had left the room;
is not this a comfortable life I live? what a passion that poor man is in!
               
               "Was Mr. Autumn angry, madam?" said Henrietta.
               "To be sure he was," said the lady;
did you not observe it?
               
               
                  

was gone, my lady sent for me, and, in a violent rage, told me I should not stay another night in her house. She was informed, she said, that I had been the cause of your running away, by filling your head with notions of her designing to confine you in a convent. She would hear nothing that I could say in my own defence; and dismissed me that very evening.
               
               "I am excessively sorry," said Henrietta,
that you should suffer so much on my account â€”It was indeed very imprudent in me to be so communicative to miss Woodby, but I could not imagine she was capable of so much treachery.
               
               
                  But how have you been able to conceal yourself so well, miss, from the enquiries of all your friends?
said Mrs. White.
Mr. Bale, it seems, your guardian's son, knew not where to find you.
               
               
                  Did Mr. Bale say he knew not where I was?
cried miss Courteney, in astonishment.
               "He told Mr. Danvers so," replied Mrs. White,
who went several times by my lady's orders to enquire for you.
               
               
                  Was there ever such complicated trea-chery!
said Henrietta, looking at Mrs. Willis with tears in her eyes.
Well, my
"Indeed, madam," replied Henrietta,
Mr. Autumn did not seem to me to be angry.
               
               "No, really!" said Mrs. Autumn;
you have a great deal of penetration, it must be confessedâ€” You think you are very discreet now, but you are mistaken. However, I charge you, don't gossip among your companions about Mr. Autumn's unhappy jealousy; I don't want the world to know what I suffer upon that account.
               
               
                  I never will mention it, madam, to any body,
replied Henrietta.
               "Nay, for that matter," said Mrs. Autumn,
you might mention it without any bad inten-tion, by way of pitying me, or so; and per-haps I should not think the worse of you. But if you can be silent, Benson, you will oblige me; reports of this kind, you know, should not be circulated.
               
               "They never shall by me, madam," said Hen-rietta.
               "Enough, enough," cried Mrs. Autumn, hastily; "I hate long speeches."
               Henrietta was pleased with a declaration which enjoined her silence; for if it be tiresome to listen to the sallies of affectation and impertinence, it

                  e much more so to be obliged to answer them.
            
            
               

               CHAP. IV.
               
                  Gives the reader hopes of a favourable change in the circumstances of our fair heresie.
               
               HEnrietta had exercised her patience for some weeks in the service of Mrs. Au-tumn; but every day producing new instances of her folly, she resolved to quit her as soon as the countess came to town. She conceived she was in some degree accountable to that lady for her actions, since it was through her recom-mendation, that she had been introduced to Mrs. Autumn; and she thought it neccessary for the justification of her conduct, to have so considerable a witness of its being irreproach-able.
               Her lady, though she found herself always disappointed in that complaisance to her whims which she endeavoured to exact from her, yet ventured to make her a proposal, which her own want of delicacy hindered her from seeing the impropriety of.
               She had taken it into her head to try her sup-posed lover's constancy, and therefore wrote a letter to him, in the character of a lady un-known,

on whose heart he had made a deep im-pression, but who was resolved not to discover herself till she knew whether his was wholly disengaged.
               This letter, she doubted not, would produce a declaration that would afford matter of great triumph to herself, who she suspected was the secret object of his adoration.
               She acquainted her woman with her scheme, and gravely desired her to copy the letter, for Languish, she said, knew her hand.
               Henrietta blushed with surprise and shame at this improper request, and very frankly begged to be excused from complying with it.
               "What!" said Mrs. Autumn, a little con-fused; "you dispute my commands then!"
               
                  I never refused to obey any of your com-mands before, madam,
replied Henrietta;
but this, pardon me, madam, appears so strange.
               
               
                  You do not dare to suspect my virtue, I hope,
said Mrs. Autumn, in a lofty ac-cent.
               "It does not become me, madam," said Hen-rietta, "to censure your actions."
               "No, certainly," replied the lady,
nor to refuse to do any thing that I order you to do: but I would fain know if you, in your great

wisdom, think there is anything improper in this little piece of gallantry.
               
               "My opinion is of no consequence, madam," replied Henrietta;
I only beg to be excused from copying it.
               
               "Well, no more of the letter." cried Mrs. Autumn, hastily:
perhaps I had only a mind to try your discretion; perhaps too I shall like you the better for your steadinessâ€” Be modest and reserved, and you will be sure of my approbation. Were you the best servant in the world, you would not do for me, un-less you were extremely modest. And now you know my mind, be cautious how you be-have: modesty is a sure recommendation to my favour; I can pardon any fault in my ser-vant but want of modesty.
               
               Henrietta, from this declaration, had reason to think herself pretty sure of her lady's favour: for the severest prude that ever declaimed against the monstrous levity of her own sex, could not have objected to the propriety of her behaviour; but, unhappily for her, she was that very day guilty of a fault by which she incurred very shocking suspicions: for having neglected to 
                     â€¢
                  ill her lady's smelling-bottle with some fresh Eau de Luce, Mrs. Autumn declared that such heed-lessness must necessarily proceed from her hav-ing

her thoughts continually employed upon fel-lows; and telling her, that she could not endure such a creature in her sight, ordered her to be gone immediately.
               Henrietta did not think proper to offer any answer to this strange charge; but quitting her presence immediately, and her house a few mo-ments afterwards, she returned to Mrs. Willis, who, seeing her alight at her door, eagerly flew to receive her.
               "I have great news for you, my dear miss," said she,
I was this moment preparing to set out in a coach to bring you a letter, which was left here by one of your uncle's servants. It is very true,
pursued she, seeing Henrietta looked surprised.
I asked the young man, who he came from? and he said, the earl of â€”. You may believe I am impatient to know the contents of this letter. Come, my dear, and read it; I hope all your troubles are over now.
               
               Henrietta receiving the letter from her, which she took out of her pocket, followed her into the parlour, and breaking the seal,
               
                  It is my uncle's hand, indeed (said she) and this is what he writes.
               
               
                  Mrs. Courteney is desired to call at the earl ofâ€”, to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock,

he has something to propose to her for her ad-vantage.
               
               "Did I not tell you, miss," said Mrs. Willis, exultingly,
that the step you had taken would produce a favourable change in your fortune?
               
               
                  Don't be too sanguine in your expectations, my dear Mrs. Willis,
said miss Courteney;
who knows but my uncle may have another sir Isaac Darby to propose to me: however, I will certainly wait upon him, and, if possible, will be punctual to the hour he has prescribed me; but if nothing should come of this over-ture of his lordship's, I shall be your guest again for some time. I have left Mrs. Autumn.
               
               She then related to her some circumstances of that lady's extravagant folly, and the cause and manner of their parting, which, together with their comments on lordâ€”'s message, furnished them with matter sufficient for discourse during the remainder of that day: what happened to our fair heroine the next, will be found in the fol-lowing chapter.
            
            
               

               CHAP. V.
               
                  Destroys the expectations raised by the foregoing chapter.
               
               HEnrietta was at her uncle's house exactly at the hour prescribed her; and, upon sending in her name, was desired to walk into his lordship's library.
               The earl was there to receive her: he had with him two of his daughters; but these young ladies withdrew immediately, after saluting her in a very distant manner, which she returned with equal reserve and coldness.
               "Miss Courteney," said his lordship, as soon as they were alone,
I have been extremely angry with you for leaving your aunt in the strange manner you did.
               
               "I am extremely obliged to your lordship," replied Henrietta,
for taking so much interest in any thing that concerns me.
               
               "You certainly acted very indiscreetly," said the earl;
but what is past, cannot be helped. You have had the good luck to make your-self friends, notwithstanding this wrong step.

You have been at the countess ofâ€”'s seat, I hear.
               
               "Yes, my lord," answered Henrietta:
I was there withâ€”
               
               "The countess is very much your friend," interrupted his lordship, hastily,
but her son is more so.
               
               Henrietta blushed, and was silent.
               "I will not," pursued his lordship,
exa-mine into your motives for leaving lady Mea-dows; but I will, if possible, accommodate matters between you, provided you will con-cur with me in my endeavours for that pur-pose.
               
               
                  I desire nothing more earnestly than to be reconciled to my aunt,
replied Henrietta.
               
                  I believe it will be your own fault if you are not,
resumed his lordship;
and if you reco-ver her savour, your good fortune will not stop thereâ€”To keep you no longer in suspence then, lord Bâ€” has declared a passion for you, and has solicited my interest towards ef-fecting a reconciliation between your aunt and you, that he may pay his addresses to you in a proper manner.
               
               
                  I am surprised that lord Bâ€” should make such a proposal,
said Henrietta,
he is en-gaged to the daughter of a rich citizen.
               
               
                  
"No, not engaged," replied the earl;
the match has been proposed, and he has visited the young woman.
               
               "Indeed, my lord," replied Henrietta,
the affair is much further advanced.
               
               "Well, well," interrupted his lordship,
we will suppose that the writings are drawn and every thing settled; but they are not married, nor engaged neither.
               
               
                  His inclinations, you find, have taken an-other turn: you have no reason to blame him for this, I am sure; and it would be strange indeed if a man of his rank and fortune was to mind the censures of the vulgar.
               
               Henrietta was silent. His lordship pro-ceeded,
               
                  Lord Bâ€” will find it difficult, no doubt, to prevail upon the earl to break off this treaty, and consent to his marrying you, though lady Meadows should offer to make you her heir; because in that case your fortune would be greatly below that of this citizen, whom he has chose for him. Nevertheless, he does not despair of effecting this, provided your aunt will do for you what it was expected she would before you was so unhappy as to disoblige her. In this lord Bâ€” sufficiently

shews the sincerity and ardor of his passion, it is your part now to convince him that you are not ungrateful.
               
               "What would your lordship have me to do?" said Henrietta.
               "I would have you submit to your aunt," said the earl,
and regain her affection, if possibleâ–ª Lord Bâ€” has reason to expect this com-pliance from you.
               
               "I will do every thing I ought to do," re-plied Henrietta,
to recover my aunt's fa-vour, and this without any view to lord Bâ€” offers.
               
               
                  Well, we shall not examine too nicely into that matter,
interrupted his lordship smiling.
All that remains to be done, is this I will see lady Meadows myself, she will 
                        â€¢
                      in town soon, I suppose; lord Bâ€”'s pro-posal, which I will acquaint her with, w

                      captivate her attention, and be your best jus-tification. As for what little concessions s
                        â€¢
                      may expect from you, I shall leave them

                      be settled by yourselves.
               
               "There are certain concessions, however said Henrietta,
which it is impossible for 
                        â€¢
                      to make, and which, if my aunt insists up as the necessary conditions of a reconciliation between us, I must still continue under

dear,
said the good woman,
there is at least this advantage in misfortunes, that they bring us at last to wisdom. You will for the future be more cautious how you engage in such perilous enterprizes.
               
               "Ay, miss" said Mrs. White,
and how you trust false friends to the prejudice of your true onesâ€”You see what it has cost meâ€” but no more of thatâ€” I can forget and for-give.
               
               "Well, and what is now to be done?" said miss Courteney, folding her hands with a me-lancholy air.
               "It is easy to answer that question," said Mrs. Willis;
you must write to your aunt, my dear, and give her an account of all that has happened to you. There is certainly something to condemn in what you have done; but in what you have suffered, there is much to be pitied. I am persuaded her ten-derness will silence her resentment. I hoped to have left you with your aunt, miss,
con-tinued Mrs. Willis;
but since that cannot be, you will return with me, I suppose.
               
               "To be sure I will," said miss Courteney,
with whom in my present situation can I be so happy as with you?
               
               
                  

displeasure, and hazard all the consequences of it.
               
               
                  I am afraid you are going to say some silly thing or other,
interrupted his lordship, rising from his seat; which motion Henrietta understanding as a hint for her to hasten her de-parture, rose also.
               "I will detain your lordship no longer," said she,
than just to tell you that some time ago my aunt proposed to me to settle all her fortune upon me, provided I would embrace the Ro-man catholick religion.
               
               "A noble offer, upon my honour!" said his lordship, "and did you refuse it?"
               
                  Would your lordship have had me accept of it?
said Henrietta.
               
                  What signifies what I would have had you do,
replied the earl, peevishly.
What did the consideration of your own interest sug-gest to you?
               
               "To refuse it, my lord," answered Henrietta, "and I did so."
               "I find you are a very romantick girl," said his lordship;
I am resolved to trouble myself no more about your affairs.
               
               
                  I hope it will not be imputed to me as a crime,
said Henrietta,
that I could not be bribed to change my religion.
               
               
                  
"Change your religion!" repeated the earl,
what necessity was there for your changing your religion: you might have humoured the old woman, have gone with her to mass, and conformed to some of her super-stitious ceremonies, and be a good protestant in your heart notwithstanding; the world, knowing your motives, would have com-mended you for such a prudent conductâ€”I see there is nothing to be done with you,
pursued he, after a little pause.
For the sake of the unfortunate man, who was your fa-ther, I would have been glad to have seen you well married; but lord Bâ€” is not such a fool as to take you without a fortune; and as you cannot reasonably have any expec-tations but from lady Meadows, who has no children, and may leave her fortune to whom she pleases, without doing any body injustice, you know best whether it is worth your while to make a proper submission to her or not.
               
               "I will never make an improper one," said Henrietta.
               "To be sure," said his lordship,
your own wisdom is to be judge of that.
               
               
                  
"No, my lord," replied Henrietta;
you shall if you please be judgeâ€” if my con-scienceâ€”
               
               
                  Pray, let me hear nothing about your con-science,
interrupted the earl;
it is not my business to let matters even between you and your conscience: your aunt's popish confessor, who is likely to be her heir, is skilful in those things; yet I would not advise you to consult him neither, for he is an interested person: but remember, that you may either secure to yourself a good estate, and marry a very de-serving young nobleman, or continue in the obscurity and want your father left you in, which is all the legacy he bequeathed you. Think well of this, and then let your con-science determine, I do not advise you to do any thing against it.
               
               "My resolution is already fixed," said Hen-rietta;
my conscience will neither permit me to change my religion, nor to counterfeit a change of it.
               
               "Do you insinuate by that," said his lord-ship, hastily,
that I advised you to do either the one or the other?
               
               "My aunt already knows my mind," said Henrietta, evading a question which she could

not answer truly without offending him;
I have nothing to hope for from your lordship's interposition, unless she has been pleased to give up this point; and I shall chearfully re-turn to that poverty my father bequeathed me, since with it he bequeathed me piety and virtue.
               
               
                  It is a pity he did not leave you prudence also,
said the earl, who found something very provoking in this last speech,
you would not then have disobliged your aunt by you
                        â€¢
                      scandalous elopement from her, which ha
                        â€¢
                      reduced you to the miserable condition you are now in, so that your friends know no
                        â€¢
                      how to take notice of you.
               
               "Friends! my lord," replied Henrietta, rising in her temper;
I have no friends, I have only relations.
               
               "That is likely to be their misfortune," sai
                     â€¢
                   his lordship, who was very angry at this sarcasm
your undutifulness to your aunt makes you unworthy of the notice of your relations and I declare to you plainly, that from the moment I will never concern myself abo
                        â€¢â€¢
                      you.
               
               Henrietta disdained to make any answer this unjust and cruel speech; but courtefied

silence, and withdrew? leaving the earl very well satisfied with himself for the tender and pa-rental part he had acted towards his brother's daughter, and furnished with excellent reasons for never seeing her more.
               "I had provided a match for her," said he, that very evening, to an humble friend, who he knew would not fail to spread the report,
not unworthy of a daughter of my own. She rejected my proposal. She refused to make any submission to her aunt, whom I would have prevailed upon to be reconciled to her. Let her suffer the consequences of her obsti-nacy and folly; I have done all that I ought to do, and am justified to the world.
               
               His lordship forgot to add, that the submission which was expected from her was nothing more than the change of her religion, and the match she so obstinately refused, could not be effected without she purchased a fortune by an impious hypocrisy. Nevertheless the omission of these trifling circumstances gave such a colour to Hen-rietta's behaviour, that she was considered by all, who heard her uncle's account of it, as an unhappy young creature, who would ruin her-self, and be the blot of a noble family.
               
                  
As for our fair heroine, she foresaw that her uncle would justify his neglect of her at her expence. She had every thing against her; rank, fortune, power; that general prejudice which prevails against the unfortunate, and that as general servility which adopts the passions of the great. But these reflections filled her with no uneasy apprehensions; for there is this ad-vantage in virtue, that it is sufficient for it-self, and needs not the applause or support of others, its own consciousness is its best re-ward.
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               
                  In which lord Bâ€”shews himself a true modern lover.
               
               HEnrietta, before she went home, waited upon lady Dâ€”, to acquaint her that she had left Mrs. Autumn. She avoided mention-ing that lady's peculiarities which had made it impossible to please her; but with great simpli-city related the error she had been guilty of, and the suspicions she had incurred by it, which oc-casioned her dismission.
               
                  
Lady Dâ€” diverted herself for some time with the extreme delicacy of her whimsical friend, and then told Henrietta, that having still a good opinion of her prudence and mo-desty, notwithstanding the reasons Mrs. Au-tumn had to suspect her, she would place her about a young lady, a relation of her own.
               Henrietta thanked her in very respectful terms, and took her leave, after she had, at lady Dâ€”'s desire, left her a direction to her lodgings, that she might know where to send for her when it was necessary.
               At her return, she found the faithful Mrs. Willis full of anxious impatience to hear the success of her visit to the earl. Henrietta, thro' respect to her uncle, concealed the greatest part of his discourse to her, but owned that she had no expectations from him.
               Mrs. Willis shrugged up her shoulders:
Then it was as you suspected (said she) your uncle has proposed some absurd match to you, and you have forfeited his future fa-vour by not complying with it.
               
               
                  You will be surprised to hear that lord Bâ€” has made an application to my uncle,
said Henrietta.
               "Surprised!" repeated Mrs. Willis;
why, to be sure, considering how your affairs are

circumstanced, this is a generous way of proceeding. Well, I hope you begin now to have a favourable opinion both of his love and honour.
               
               "I am sure I think highly of his prudence," replied Henrietta, smiling:
only mark the caution with which he acts in this affair; my poverty gave him hopes that I should be an easy conquest, and that passion which first manifested itself in an open attempt upon my honour, sought afterwards to allure me with bribes. It is not strange that persons who hold money to be the greatest good, should think it more than an equivalent for virtue. Here, however, he was disappointed again, to his great astonishment, no doubt, and mar-riage is this honourable lover's last resource; but this he does not offer till he is sure I shall have a fortune, if not equal to that of my rival the packer's daughter, yet at least suf-ficient to justify his choice in 
                        
                      opinion of the prudential part of the world: and per-haps he expects I should purchase the mighty blessing of his hand by the sacrifice, the tem-porary sacrifice at least of those principles, for which I have already suffered so much.
               
               
                  

                  Have you any reason for this shocking sus-picion?
interrupted Mrs. Willis.
               "I think I have," replied Henrietta:
a reconciliation with my aunt is, it seems, a necessary preliminary to his addresses; and yet he heard from myself upon what condi-tion that reconciliation could only be effect-ed.
Henrietta, suddenly interrupting her-self, cried out,
There he is; there is lord Bâ€”.
               
               "Where? where?" said Mrs. Willis, run-ning to the window. "It is certainly he," said Henrietta, "he passed by in a chair.
               That instant they heard a loud rap at the door.
               "As I live," cried Mrs. Willis (in a violent flutter)
he is come to visit you. I hope you will see him, miss Courteney; hear what he has to say, pray do; there can be no harm in that, I am sure.
               
               "Well, well," said Henrietta, smiling at her solicitude;
I will see him; let him be shewn into the other parlour, if you please.
               
               Mrs. Willis, curious to see this young lord, went herself to open the door. He bolted out of the chair; and, with a look and accent full of impatience, asked her, if the young lady that lodged there was at home?"
               
                  
"Miss Courteney, sir?" said Mrs. Willis.
               "Yes," replied he, hastily;
is she at home, can I see her? Pray tell her a gentleman from â€”, enquires for her.
               
               Mrs. Willis desired him to walk into the par-lour, said she would acquaint the young lady with his being there; and a few moments after-wards Henrietta appeared.
               Lord Bâ€” flew to meet her, with the air of a lover conscious of the right he had to be well received; and, taking her hand, which he respectfully kissed,
               "Now," cried he, exultingly,
can you doubt the ardor of my passion for you? and will you not at length confess that it is possible for a man to deserve you?
               
               "Certainly; my lord," replied Henrietta, "it is very possible."
               
                  May I perish if I think so (said he) but how poorly would words express my adora-tion of you. Judge of the purity, the ardor of my love, by what I have done to make you mineâ€”Have you not seen your uncle, miss Courteney?
               
               "I have, my lord," replied Henrietta.
               "You have!" repeated his lordship;
and in that grave cold accent too. Surely my sentiments and designs are still unknown to
Mrs. White desired she might be permitted to come and see her, to which Henrietta readily consented; promising, if she was reconciled to her aunt, to use her utmost endeavours to rein-state her in her place.

                  Which throws new lights upon Mr. Bale's behaviour, and contains a very improving conversation.
               
               THE two ladies being again seated in their post-chaise, Mrs. Willis kindly applied herself to comfort her fair companion, whose affecting silence, shewed a deeper sense of her new disappointment than any words could ex-press. However, miss Courteney felt in reality lower perturbations and less anxiety in her re-turn, than when she began her journey. So true it is, that when we hope little, we fear little likewise.
               She now looked upon her aunt's affection as irrecoverable; miss Woodby's vile insinuations had strengthened her suspicions: Mr. Bale, when he found himself detected, would doubt-less account for his behaviour in a manner un-

                  vourable to her; her unhappy flight had given such a colour to her succeeding actions, as ren-dered

you: it is impossible else that you should be thus insensible, nay ungrateful, I will sayâ€” for I have given no common proofs of love, I think.
               
               "Indeed, my lord," replied Henrietta, who had a mind to teaze this generous lover a little,
you shall not suffer for your noble disinterest-ednessâ€” you shall not relinquish miss Cord-wain and her immense fortune for me.
               
               "Name not her fortune," cried lord Bâ€”; "were it millions I would refuse it for you."
               
                  Nay, now your lordship is quite roman-tick,
said Henrietta,
to prefer to a rich heiress an unhappy young woman, deserted by her relations, and reduced to seek a sub-sistence by her labour.
               
               "Call not my passion romantick," inter-rupted lord Bâ€”,
because it soars above common conceptions: a mind so elevated as your's might give it a juster epithet.
               
               "Were my aunt," pursued Henrietta,
to leave me her whole estate, you would still make no inconsiderable sacrifice by quitting miss Cordwain for me, since my fortune would then be greatly inferior to her's. But you know, my lord, I have no expectations from lady Meadows: I have declared to my

uncle the hard conditions upon which she offers to make me her heir, conditions that I never will accept of; and therefore I may well call your passion romantick, when, under such circumstances, you could think of mak-ing an application to my uncle.
               
               "To be sure, madam," said lord Bâ€”, whose countenance expressed at once surprise, confusion, and disappointmentâ€”
I did apply to the earl, not personally indeed. I con-trived it so that a friend of mine, who is very intimate with his lordship, should give him a hint of your situation, and the sentiments I entertained for you: and, from the ac-count my friend gave me of his success in his negotiation, I conceived that you might be prevailed uponâ€”that is, that you would con-siderâ€” For might I not hope, my dear miss Courteney, that you would not be insensible of my affection.
               
               Here his lordship paused, and looked on Hen-rietta with a languishing air, seeming to wish and expect that her tenderness would spare him a further explanation; but our fair heroine who did not chuse to collect his meaning from the abrupt and inconnected sentences he had uttered, continued maliciously silent, as if she waited for the end of his discourse.
               
                  

                  I see (resumed he) that I have not been happy enough to inspire you with any tender sentiments for me. Pardon me, miss Cour-teney, but I must be so free as to tell you that if you were not prepossessed in favour of another person, the proofs I have given you of my affection would not be received with such indifference.
               
               "There needs not any such prepossession," replied Henrietta, vexed at this hint,
to make me receive with indifference the proofs you have hitherto given me of that affection your lordship boasts of. Am I to reckon among these proofs, my lord, the insult you offered me at Mrs. Eccles's, and the strange declara-tion you made me in the country?
               
               "Ah, how cruel is this recapitulation now!" cried lord Bâ€”:
do I not do justice to your birth, your beauty and virtue, by my present honourable intentions?
               
               "It is not enough for me, my lord," said Henrietta,
that your intentions are honour-able now; to have merited my esteem, they should always have been so: but, to speak plainly, I am still doubtful of your inten-tions.
               
               
                  
"Doubtful still of my intentions!" repeated lord Bâ€”:
have I not declared them to your uncle, madam? have I not solicited his in-terest with you?
               
               "Suppose that obtained my lord," said Hen-rietta,
and that it has all the weight with me you could wish.
               
               "Why then we shall be happy, my angel," cried he, taking her hand, and pressing it to his lips.
You will be reconciled to your aunt, and I may hope for my father's consent to our union.
               
               
                  A reconciliation with my aunt is impos-sible,
said Henrietta, withdrawing her hand.
               "Say not that it is impossible," replied lord Bâ€”,
but that you have not complaisance enough for me, to attempt it.
               
               "Did I not know it to be impossible," re-sumed Henrietta,
I would attempt it for my own sake; but nothing less than the sacri-fice of my religion will satisfy my aunt: on this condition indeed she promises to settle her whole estate upon me; I think I once told your lordship so.
               
               "You did, my dear miss Courteney," inter-rupted lord Bâ€”;
and I adore you for your steady adherence to your principles.
               
               
                  
Henrietta was a little startled at so unexpected a declaration; but lord Bâ€”did not suffer her to remain long in the error his last words had occasioned.
               "If lady Meadows was not such a bigot," pursued he,
excuse my freedom, miss, we might expect that she would receive my pro-posals with pleasure, and make such conces-sions in favour of her niece, as might en-gage my father's consent to our marriage: but since this is hopeless, is it reasonable that you should be the victim of her obstinacy? by seeming only to comply with your aunt's de-sires, all obstacles to our union will be re-moved; a temporary compliance is all that is necessary to secure to you a fortune, and a rank in life suitable to your birth. Do not imagine that I wish to see you a proselyte to the religion she professes: no, if any thing could weaken my passion, your being capable of such a change, upon interested motives, would do it. I love you; I repeat it again, I love you for your piety.
               
               "Then, to be sure, my lord," replied Hen-rietta,
you think that a little dissimulation in this case would be a virtue.
               
               
                  
"In your circumstances," resumed lord Bâ€”,
it certainly would; for while your principles are unchanged, what do you sacrifice, in yielding to your aunt, but externals only? this sacrifice your interest, your happiness de-mands of you; let me add also that you owe it to a man who loves you with the ardor I do. And surely, to industriously seek occa-sions of suffering for a religion, which, if you could be contented with secretly professing, you would be happy yourself, and make o-thers happy also, is to give the world reason to suspect that ostentation has a greater share in your resolves than piety. Therefore, my dear miss Courteney, you see it is not the sacrifice of your religion that I require of you, but of the reputation of suffering for it.
               
               "Well, my lord," replied Henrietta, who had listened to him with great calmness,
if ever I was in doubt of your intentions, you have clearly explained them now; of them, and of the sentiments you have avowed, you may collect my opinion, when I declare to you, that if you had worlds to bestow on me, I would not be your wife.
               
               "Is this your resolution, miss Courteney?" said his lordship.
               
                  

                  It is, my lord (she replied). A resolution justifiable upon your own great principle in-terest. It is my interest I consult, when I prefer poverty and servitude to the fortune my aunt can give me; because the silent testi-mony of a quiet conscience is, in my opinion, of infinitely more value than riches. It is in-terest by which I am influenced, when I re-fuse your offered alliance, because I am sure I could not be happy with a man whom I can-not esteem.
               
               "Hold, madam, hold," interrupted lord Bâ€”,
this is too much: I have not deserved this treatment, but I thank you for it; yes, from my soul I thank you for it: it has helped to restore my senses; I have been foolish, very foolish, I confess.
               
               His lordship indeed looked foolish enough when he pronounced these words, which were succeeded by a pause of several minutes: then suddenly starting from his seat, and bowing with an affected negligence,
               
                  The best apology I can make, madam (said he) for the importunate visit I have paid you, is to assure you I never will repeat it.
               
               Henrietta courtefied gravely without answer-ing him; and having rung the bell for a servant to attend him to the door, went into the room

where her friend was sitting. Lord Bâ€” stopped, looked back, and, finding she had withdrawn, he rushed out hastily, and flung himself into his chair, glad of his escape, and congratulating himself upon the victory he had gained over his passion; for, in the first emo-tions of his grief at parting, he had almost re-solved to declare he would marry her without any fortune: but her disappearing so suddenly, gave him time for a moment's reflection, and that was sufficient to hinder him from being guilty of an imprudence which he now trembled at the thoughts of.
               It is so difficult for mean and selfish persons to conceive that any thing but private advantage can influence the resolutions of others, that not-withstanding the proof Henrietta had given of her attachment to her religion, and her invio-lable regard to truth, yet still lord Bâ€” sup-posed there must be some other latent motive for a conduct, in his opinion, highly ridiculous, and very inconsistent with that good sense which it was apparent she possessed.
               Sometimes he fancied he had a rival; and then, to clear a doubt so tormenting, he was upon the point of returning to her to offer her his hand upon her own conditions: but his avarice restrained him from making so dan-gerous

a trial: she might accept his offer; and with all the passion he felt for her, he could not resolve to marry her without a fortune.
               To stifle a thought which suggested to him designs so destructive to his interest, he endea-voured to persuade himself that her obstinacy, in refusing to temporize a little when such mighty advantages were in view, was the effect of female vanity, which sought distinction at the expence of solid happiness. In this opinion he was confirmed by his friend, whom he had employed to sound the earl her uncle with re-gard to his proposals, and to whom he now communicated the result of his interview with Henrietta.
               "Depend upon it," said this sagacious per-son,
your goddess will descend from her ro-mantick flights, when she finds she has almost soared out of human ken; and is much more likely to be laughed at for her extravagant folly, than admired and applauded for her ex-traordinary piety. Follow my advice (pur-sued he) suffer your mistress to believe you have broke her chains; if interest does not make her wish to recall you, vanity will. Few women can endure that a lover should escape them; and, to recover their influence, they often make concessions, which, in the

zenith of their power, they would have thought impossible.
               
               Lord Bâ€”improved a little upon his friend's scheme, and resolved to continue his addresses to miss Cordwain, to pique Henrietta, he said; but in reality, he was as much in love with the fortune of that young lady, as with the person of our fair heroine; and was not willing to ha-zard the loss of the one, while it was yet doubt-ful whether he should ever possess the other.

any justification of herself hopeless; and the insidious chaplain might now with case con-firm those prejudices he had raised.
               In this manner she reasoned herself into a be-lief that her misfortune was irremediable: despair, as an ingenious writerThe author of maxims, characters, and reflections, etc. Printed for J. and R. Tonson. observes, being that ease to the mind which mortification is to the flesh, Henrietta found some relief in being freed from that vicissitude of hopes and fears which had so long held her mind in the most racking suspence; and, with a kind of gloomy satisfaction, resigned herself to all the bitterness of her fate.
               Mrs. Willis, who knew not the peculiarities of lady Meadows's temper, or if she had, would not perhaps have considered, that obstinate people are ever most obstinate in error, thought all things might be set right again, by miss Cour-teney's giving a candid narrative of what had happened to her since her leaving her; she there-fore pressed the young lady to delay writing to her aunt no longer than the next day.
               "There are some cases," said Mrs. Willis to her, when she saw her sitting down to write,
in which simplicity is the greatest refinement of art; yours is one of them: be as simple and

that a reconciliation might be effected, without those shocking conditions which had at first been proposed to her.
               
                  If I thought such an application would be successful,
replied Henrietta,
I would rea-dily consent to it. For you may easily ima-gine, my dear Mrs. Willis, that this low condition is not my choice: but I know my aunt's temper; whatever she desires, she de-sires with ardor; and makes a merit at per-sisting obstinately in a resolution she has once formed. Her pride will be a more powerful advocate for me, than any thing the coun-tess can urge; to that I formerly owed my deliverance from dependence, more mortify-ing than servitude. This pride will no doubt be sensibly wounded, when she finds that I am determined in my choice; if any thing can make her recede from her purpose, it will be the shame of seeing her niece reduced so low. But surely it is not the way to con-vince her I am really determined, if I allow my friends to teaze her with solicitations, when she has already declared her resolution in such strong terms: she will believe that I have engaged them to make this trial; she will be offended with their interposition, and

perhaps be the less inclined to raise me from this obscure condition, as she will not have the merit of doing it from her own generosity and tenderness, but at the instances of others: time only, my dear Mrs. Willis, can produce any favourable change in my circumstances; it will either soften the hearts of my relations, or it will blunt my sense of the meanness of my condition, by familiarizing me to it. This I am sure of at least, that, in the conscious-ness of doing right, I shall always find an un-failing source of happiness, however Provi-dence may think fit to dispose of me.
               
               
                  Ah, never doubt but you are the care of Providence, my dear miss,
cried Mrs. Willis,
such virtue and piety must sooner or later be happy: Heaven and your own prudence di-rect you.
               
               "I have not always been prudent," said Hen-rietta, sighing;
but misfortunes, as you once told me, teach us wisdom.
               
               Mrs. Willis, observing an unusual pensiveness stealing over the sweet features of Henrietta or this reflection, changed the discourse to a less interesting subject, and employed her utmost as-siduity and tenderness to make the time she stayed with her pass agreeably.
               
                  
A week being elapsed, and no message com-ing from lady Dâ€”, Henrietta began to apprehend that she should be disappointed of a place, in which she expected more satisfaction than she had found in those she had hitherto been in, when she was surprised with a visit from the countess ofâ€”.
               She flew to receive her with a respectful joy. The lady tenderly pressed her handâ€”
               
                  I had business in the city (said she) and I took this opportunity to call on youâ€”and how do you do, my dear good girl? (pursued she) have you any agreeable news to tell me? has your family relented yet?
               
               
                  I have no reason to think they have, ma-dam, replied Henrietta.
               
               "Shocking insensibility!" exclaimed the countess, lifting up her eyes;
you have been very ill used too by Mrs. Autumn, my sister tells me.
               
               Henrietta smiled, but was silent.
               "Well, miss Courteney," resumed the coun-tess,
will you come and live with me as my friend and companion. I know your generous scorn of dependence; but it is the unworthi-ness of the donor only, that can make benefits sit heavy on a mind like your's: there is often as much greatness of soul in receiving

as in conferring benefits; and when true friendship is the motive for giving, it is pride, not generosity, to refuse.
               
               "Do me the justice to believeâ–ª madam," replied Henrietta,
that I receive this instance of your goodness with the deepest gratitude, but there isâ€”
               
               "I understand you," interrupted the coun-tessâ€”
my son; but I hope, when he is mar-ried, you will have no objection to living with me as my friend.
               
               The countess, in speaking these words, looked earnestly on Henrietta.
               
                  No, certainly, madam (cried she, eagerly I shall think myself happy in living with you in any situation.
               
               
                  I know not what to think of my son's con-duct in this affair,
resumed the countess

Her eyes, as sh

                   pronounced these words, seemed to demand a explanation of Henrietta.
               
                  I am afraid, madam (replied she) that have been partly the cause of these delays.
               
               "That is candidly said," interrupted t
                     â€¢
                   countess; "have you seen my son lately?"
               
                  
"I have madam," answered Henrietta;
but your ladyship may be entirely easy.
               
               "Easy!" repeated the countess;
why do you imagine that I am so insensible of your meritâ€”but you know, my good girl, lord Bâ€” is in honour engaged to miss Cord-wain.
               
               "His lordship's partiality for me," said Hen-rietta,
has induced him to carry this matter further than (as he is circumstanced) I think he should have done. He has caused my uncle to be applied to; but this has produced nothing, madam. I told lord Bâ€” upon what conditions my aunt had offered to settle her estate upon me; and his lordship is con-vinced that I cannot comply with them. My resolution is fixed, my lord Bâ€” knows it is so, and you have nothing to fear, madam, from any imprudence on his side, or any un-generosity on mine. I ventured to promise that I would deserve the confidence you was pleased to place in me on this occasion, and I hope I have and shall continue to deserve it.
               
               Notwithstanding the delicate manner in which Henrietta stated the affair between her and lord Bâ€”, yet the countess discovered that her son had shewn more prudence than generosity, or

even love in his behaviour; and, by a strange contradiction in the human heart, she at once approved and condemned, was pleased with, yet ashamed of his conduct; but charmed with Henrietta's noble disinterestedness, her candour and sincerity, she embraced her with the ten-derness of a mother, and perhaps with the more tenderness, because she was not likely she should not be her mother.
               
                  I am impatient (said she) till I can have you with me, that I may have it in my power to shew you how greatly I both love and esteem you.
               
               Henrietta thanked her with great politeness; and then told her of lady Dâ€”'s intentions to recommend her to a young lady, a relation of her's.
               "Oh! miss Belmour, you mean," said the countess;
my sister mentioned it to me: she is an agreeable young woman, has a very good fortune, and is entirely mistress of herself She will be much better pleased to receive you in the character of a companion that a servant, when she knows your birth and merit.
               
               
                  I will owe obligations of that kind to non but yourself, madam,
replied Henrietta
and I beg this young lady may know no mor
                        â€¢
                     
                     

of me than what is just necessary to recom-mend me to her good opinion as a servant.
               
               The countess contested this point with her for some time; but finding her not to be dissuaded from her design, "Well!" said she, kindly,
you shall be indulged this once, but remember I claim your promise to come to me when a certain objection is removed; in the mean time we will settle you with miss Belmour in the way you chuse. She will be with my sister to-morrow morning; and if you come like-wise, lady Dâ€” will introduce you to her.
               
               Henrietta said she would not fail to attend lady Dâ€” Upon which the countess rose up, kissed her at parting, and desired she would look upon her as one of her most faithful friends.
               Our fair heroine had reason to be satisfied with the kind manner in which lady Dâ€” recom-mended her to miss Belmour, as well as with the reception that young lady gave her. She carried her home with her in her coach, and behaved to her with an affability that Henrietta could no otherwise account for, than by suppos-sing the countess had discovered her true name and circumstances to her.â€” In this, however, she was mistaken: her young mistress was in love; she had occasion for a confidant. Hen-rietta's youth and gentleness promised her she

would be an indulgent one: besides, her good sense and the elegance of her person and behaviour so lessened the distance between the mistress and servant, that her pride was not wounded by the familiarity with which she condescended to treat her, as the necessary prelude to the confidence she was resolved to repose in her.
               Henrietta listened with complaisance to the overflowings of a heart tender by nature, and wholly possessed, as she thought, by a deserving object; but when miss Belmour, in the course of frequent conversations on this exhaustless theme, gave her to understand that this lover of whom she boasted was the husband of another lady, from whom he had been parted several years, surprise, horror, grief, were so strongly impressed on her countenance, that her lady be

                   all she did.
               
                  
She began with telling Henrietta, that Mr. Campley had when very young, been forced, by an avaricious father to marry a woman whom he could not love, and with whom he had been so miserable, that a separation was agreed to by the relations on both sides.
               Henrietta sighed sympathetically at this ac-count. Miss Belmour, encouraged by this mark of her sensibility, proceeded with great fluency of language, to expatiate on the resistless power of love: her lover's sophistry had furnished her with arguments to prove, that the marriage he had been forced into was not binding in the sight of heaven, and that he was at liberty to bestow his affections elsewhere. She treated marriage as a mere human institution, adopted the senti-ments of Eloisa, talked of a union of hearts, eternal constancy, generous confidenceâ€”Hen-rietta heard her with patience; but being out of breath at last, she stopped, and seemed to expect a reply.
               Our fair heroine, with all the humility becom-ing her station, but at the same time with all the 
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  ness of virtue, opposed the specious argu-ments she had urged with others which reason, religion, and the purity of her own sentiments suggested to her: these, however, made very little impression on miss Belmour. She yawned,

smiled contemptuously, and was several times ready to interrupt her with an authoritative air, but refrained, from the consideration that her woman was now, by the participation of her se-cret, become her companion, if not something more.
               Henrietta, despairing to rescue her unhappy mistress, by motives of piety, from the snares that were laid for her, sought even to interest her passions in the cause of virtue.
               
                  You depend, madam (pursued she) upon your lover's constancy; but what security can you have that he will be constant?
               
               "What security!" interrupted miss Belmour, roused to attention by so interesting a question; "his vows."
               
                  These vows, madam (said Henrietta) will expire with the passion that caused them: he will be constant as long as he loves, but how long he will love, is the doubt.
               
               "I am really vain enough to imagine," re-plied miss Belmour, bridling,
that those few attractions I have received from nature, since, they have gained, will fix his heart: I am quite free from any apprehensions of that sort, I can assure you.
               
               "You have charms, madam," said Henri-etta,
that entitle you to a worthier conquest

ingenuous as you can in the account you give your aunt, and let the facts speak for them-selves.
               
               Henrietta followed her advice, and related every part of her conduct since she had left her, and the treachery and deceit that had been used towards her, with the utmost plainness and sin-cerity, and saw that she had made her letter more affecting by its simplicity, than she could have done by the nicest touches of art. Mrs. Willis read it, and approved of it; and it was immediately dispatched to the post.
               Scarce was this little affair over, when Mr. Bale sent in his name.
               "I like this piece of ceremony," said Mrs. Willis;
it looks as if the man was ashamed of what he has done: do you chuse to see him, miss?
               
               "Oh! no," replied Henrietta;
it would be strange indeed if I was willing to see a man whom you suspect of having such shocking designs, and who I am sure has not acted honestly.
               
               "Well then," said Mrs. Willis,
I will go down to him, and hear what he has to say.
               
               She returned again in less than an hour, smil-ing. "This young man," said she,
does not want sense: what would you say, miss,

than of a man, who, not having it in his power to marry you, yet dishonourably seeks to ensnare your affections.
               
               
                  It is natural to wish to be beloved by those we love,
replied miss Belmour:
I am convinced Mr. Campley loves me.
               
               "If he loved you sincerely, madam," said Henrietta,
he would not make you unhappy; true love never seeks the ruin of its object: disinterestedness is the test of love; try Mr. Campley's by that.
               
               
                  Mr. Campley has no mean, selfish designs upon my fortune,
cried miss Belmour.
               
                  His designs are mean and selfish in the high-est degree,
replied Henrietta,
since he ex-pects that to make him happy you should sa-crifice your peace, your honour, and your re-putation; and should he succeed in these de-signs, which heaven forbid, the neglect he will soon treat you with will convince you, that love, when not founded on esteem, cannot be lasting: for the contempt which even li-bertines feel for those whom they have se-duced, is a proof of that secret homage which all men pay to virtue.
               
               
                  If I thought Mr. Campley would ever fail in the respect and adoration he pays me now,
said miss Belmour, "I should hate him."
               
                  

                  The only way to preserve that respect, madam,
replied Henrietta,
is not to al-low him to encourage any presumptuous hopes: if you wish to keep his heart, engage his esteem; he may one time or other, per-haps, be at liberty to offer you his hand.
               
               "Ah, Henrietta!" interrupted miss Bel-mour, sighing,
that time is very distant, I fear: but you have put strange thoughts into my head; I have been to blame to suffer Mr. Campley to talk to me so freely of his passion: indeed I think he has been less respectful, since I suffered him to perceive that I preser-ed him to all the men I ever saw. I own to you freely that it was my apprehensions of losing him that made me listen to his argu-ments; for I thought, if I reduced him to despair, he would conquer his passion for me: but what if the very means I have used to keep his heart should prove the cause of his slighting me!â€”Oh! you do not know what anxious, uneasy doubts you have raised in my mind!â€”However, I am resolved to behave with more reserve to him for the future. I will try whether his passion is strong enough to subsist of itself; for you have convinced me that the hopes with which I have hitherto fed it, have been less likely to nourish than to cloy.
               
               
                  
Henrietta would have been better pleased if sentiments more pure had suggested this design; but it was a great point gained to prevail with her on any terms to discourage the addresses of a man whose love was a crime. She flattered herself likewise that this unexpected severity in miss Belmour would produce an alteration in her unworthy lover's behaviour, which might favour her views of exciting her resentment against him; and in this she was not mistaken.
               Mr. Campley thought fit to be offended at the new plan of conduct miss Belmour had laid down for herself, and complained of it at first with that mixture of haughtiness and submission which a man, who is sure he is beloved, thinks he has a right to use; but, finding this had not the effect he desired, he had recourse to a per-sonated indifference, in order to alarm her with the fear of losing him.
               Henrietta, whom she acquainted with every change in his behaviour, told her that this was the time to humble her imperious lover.
You must either give him laws, madam (said she) or be contented to receive them of him: his aim was to degrade you to a mistress; he will love you, you see, upon no other condition.
               
               "I see it! I see it plainly!" interrupted miss Belmour, bursting into tears;
where is now

that aweful love he professed for me, when a look, a smile, was a sufficient reward for all his sufferings!â€”Dear Henrietta tell me what I shall do to shew him how much I hate and despise him.
               
               "Avoid him, madam, as much as possible," replied Henrietta.
When you happen to meet him in company, suffer him not to speak to you apart, and receive no letters from him; persist in this conduct, and you will convince him that you are resolved not to purchase the continuance of his affection by the sacrifice of your honour. If he is capable of a sincere and generous passion, he will esteem and re-verence that virtue which opposes his desires; and his esteem will strengthen his love.
               
               "Yes," cried miss Belmour,
he shall find that he is not so sure of me as he has the pre-sumption to imagine. I will tell him so my-self, and see him again, but it shall be only to declare that I will never see him moreâ€”Give me pen and ink, my dear Henrietta: I will appoint him a meeting at lady Dâ€”'s this evening; and while the company is engaged at cards, I shall have an opportunity to tell him the resolution I have formed, and doubt no but I will speak to him in the severest term

my resentment can suggest: he shall know, to his confusion, that I am in earnest.
               
               "Indeed, madam," said Henrietta,
that is not the way to persuade him that you are in earnest; let your actions speak for you; shun him carefully, and then he must be convinced that you do not feign.
               
               "I have thought of a way to torment him," said miss Belmour, after a little pause;
I will go to Paris. Last year some ladies of my acquaintance proposed to me to go there with them, and I had almost consented; but the wretch, who braves me so insolently now, declared then that he could not support my absence, and seemed so overwhelmed with grief that I put off my journey for that time: but now were he to offer to stab himself at my feet, it should not alter my purpose. I will write to him this moment, and let him know my design.
               
               "Let me intreat you, madam," said Hen-rietta,
not to do that; go first, and write to him afterwardsâ€”And yet I could recom-mend a better way of punishing this insolent lover.
               
               "Tell me what better way," cried miss Bel-mour, eagerly.
               
                  
"It is to marry, madam," replied Hen-rietta;
chuse out of that crowd of lovers who address you, him whom you think most deserving. Marriage will secure your peace, your honour, and reputation, and effectually punish, the man who made the sacrifice of all these, the necessary condition of his love for you.
               
               This expedient was not at all approved of by miss Belmour. She declared she hated the whole sex for Mr. Campley's sake; and Hen-rietta had no difficulty to believe her: however, she prevailed with her to promise that she would keep her intended journey secret till she was just ready to depart, that it might not seem as if she meant only to alarm her designing lover. This promise she observed so ill, that she de-clared that very day at lady Dâ€”'s her inten-tion to spend a few months in Paris. Mr. Campley, who was there, and who still kept up his assumed indifference, instead of endeavour-ing to alter her purpose, as she expected, coldly congratulated her on the pleasures she would enjoy in that enchanting metropolis. Miss Bel-mour came home ready to burst with rage and disappointment.
               "I knew how it would be, madam," said Henrietta,
if you talked of your design. Mr.

Campley thinks he sees through the artifice of it: all you can do now is to hasten your de-parture.
               
               
                  I am resolved I'll set out to-morrow morn-ing,
said miss Belmour.
No matter for preparations; pack up a few necessaries to take with us in the coach, and leave direc-tions for my trunks to be sent after. When we come to Dover, if there is not a packet-boat ready to sail, I'll hire one at any price: I shall not be at rest till I have convinced this man I am really determined to avoid him.
               
               Henrietta kept up this spirit; and after she had given proper directions to the housekeeper, and sent orders for the coach to be ready early in the morning, she busied herself in packing up, her lady assisting, in a violent flutter of spirits, and wishing impatiently for the hour of departure.
               Our fair heroine had some objections to taking this journey herself, but her concern for mis's Belmour over-ruled them all. She was not willing to leave unfinished the good work she had begun; and she was apprehensive that, if the young lady was left to the guidance of her own passions, this sudden sally of resent-ment

would end in a reconciliation fatal to her virtue.
               She would have been glad to see the countess before she went, but there was no time for this visit; therefore she contented herself with writing to that lady, and to her friend Mrs. Willis. The countess received the news of this journey with great pleasure, because she hoped that absence would effectually cure her son's passion for Henrietta, the consequences of which she was still apprehensive of, notwithstand-ing he had shewn an extraordinary prudence in the conduct of it.
               But Mrs. Willis was very uneasy, lest any thing should happen that might make her re-pent the removing herself thus from all her friends, and putting herself entirely in the power of a stranger. Had there been time for it, she would have endeavoured to dissuade Henrietta from going; but, recollecting that Mr. Bale was in France, and that they might possibly meet, she resolved to write to the old gentleman, and give him a full account of every thing relating to the situation of his fair persecuted ward, not even omitting his son's doubtful behaviour with regard to her; for she knew, that if they met, Henrietta would be

silent upon that article, and yet it was necessary he should know it, that he might be convinced her misfortunes were chiefly owing to his son's treachery; and this consideration she hoped would produce something to her advantage.

                     â€¢â€¢
                   Henrietta observed that she frequently looked out of the windows with an air of anxious ex-pectation,

if I was to tell you that he has persuaded me he has acted very right, and with the best in-tentions in the world.
               
               
                  I should say that I am less unhappy than I thought I was,
replied miss Courteney;
for surely it is a great misfortune to meet with persons who abuse our confidence and the good opinion we have of them.
               
               "That misfortune," said Mrs. Willis,
will in time become so common, that you will feel it less sensibly than you do now. The only way to avoid being deceived, is to be always upon your guard against deceit.
               
               "That is to say I must be always suspicious," said Henrietta;
that may be a very prudent maxim, but my heart disavows it.
               
               "Alas! my dear," replied Mrs. Willis,
we all enter upon the world with high notions of disinterestedness, friendship, sincerity, and candor: but experience shows us, that these qualities exist not, or among so very few, that it does not fall to the lot of one mortal in a thousand to meet with them in those we con-tract friendships with. The frequent disap-pointments we suffer in the search of them, make suspicion grow into a habit of think-ing, which if it lessens our enjoyments lessens our inconveniencies likewise.
               
               
                  

and would sigh when she drew in her head again, as if she had been disappointedâ€” Doubtless she had conceived hopes that her lover would follow her; and, considering this neglect as a new proof of his indifference, it re-doubled her rage, and strengthened a resolu-tion which reason and virtue had very little share in.
               This thought gave Henrietta great concern: her conversion promised no great permanency, since it was founded on such motives; but all she could now do was to manage her passions, for the time was not yet come, to touch her heart by sentiments of piety and virtue.
               On their arrival at Dover, they found the Ca-lais packet-boat ready to sail. Miss Belmour, who would fain have lingered at Dover a day, was not much pleased with this circumstance, but her pride was concerned not to betray any irre-solution; accordingly she embarked with a to-lerable good grace; and the wind continuing fair, they soon landed at Calais.
               Miss Belmour having made the journey be-fore, was under no embarassment how to con-duct herself. The customary ceremonies at landing being over, she proceeded to the inn she had formerly been at; and having hired a post-chaise for herself and Henrietta, and a horse

for her servant, she set out immediately after dinner, and reached Boulogne that

                  ing.
               As the chaise stopped at the inn they put up at, two gentlemen alighted from their horses at the same time; one of whom hearing they were English ladies advanced, and respectfully offered them his hand to help them out. Miss Belmour, pleased with the graceful appearance of this stranger, politely accepted his assistance, which he likewise tendered to Henrietta, whose charms, at the first glance, made a powerful impression on his heart.
               His eyes told her this so intelligibly, that she was under some confusion; yet she found in herself a kind of satisfaction at the attention with which he gazed on her, and was now for the first time sensible to the pleasure of cha

The young gentleman stood gazing after her as long as she was in sight; then turning to his friend, who was giving some orders to their footmen,
               "Oh, Charles!" cried he, with a look half serious, half gay, "my fatal hour is come."
               "What! I'll warrant you," said the other,
you are shot through the heart with the glances of the younger of those ladies; I ob-served how you gazed on her.
               
               "Is she not a charming creature?" exclaimed the first;
what features! what a complex-ion! what elegance in her whole form!â€”I am sure she has wit; I saw her soul in her eyes.
               
               "Faith! I am half concerned for you," in-terrupted Charles, with an affected seriousness:
this will be an unfortunate encounter, I am afraid.
               
               
                  Can we not think of some method to in-troduce ourselves to them?
cried the other, without minding what he had said:
I shall not rest till I find out who they are.
               
               "What will it signify to you to know," replied Charles:
they are going to Paris, and we to London.
               
               "Why aye, that is true," said the other,
we shall go different ways in the morning;

and yetâ€”what think you, my dear Charles, of going back to Paris for a few days, and we shall have an opportunity of escorting these fair travellers?â€”Come, it will be but a frolick, and I know you are no enemy to them.
               
               "I don't like this frolick," replied Charles;
it has too serious an air: sure you are strangly charmed with this girlâ€”Just upon the point of seeing your father and your family, after a long absence, and so suddenly to resolve upon protracting your stay from themâ€”I don't half like it I confess, and this once, my lord, I must oppose your inclinations.
               
               "Oh, sir, you are grave!" replied his lord-ship, a little sullenly,
you have a mind to exert the governor too; but let me tell you, that, considering the equality of our years and the terms we have hitheto lived upon, this wisdom is very unseasonable.
               
               The young lord, having said this with some emotion, hastily entered the house; and calling to the inn-keeper to shew him a room, went away, without taking any farther notice of his governor, who stood musing for some time after he was gone, and then followed him with an intention to bring him, if possible to reason.
               
                  
Upon his entering the room, he found his pupil leaning on a table, with a discontented air. He just raised his head to see who it was that came in; and immediately resumed his former posture, without speaking a word.
               The governor looked at him a moment in si-lence; at last,
               
                  This pensiveness (said he) and this cause-less resentment; are they not strong argu-ments against my complying with your pro-posal? The impression this girl has made on your heart must needs be very great, since it can make you already forget that friendship you have vowed for me, and in which I placed so much happiness.
               
               
                  It is you, not I, who seems to have forgot our mutual friendship,
replied the young noble-man, melted at those last words:
Why did you, my dear Charles, lose the beloved friend and companion in the austere governor? is not this strange affectation!
               
               "Indeed, my lord," replied the governor,
I should be unworthy the title of your friend, if I was not attentive to your interest.
               
               "Was there ever any thing so absurd," inter-rupted his lordship,
to make a serious affair of a little idle curiosity!
               
               
                  
"Don't you make a serious affair of it," re-plied the governor,
and I shall be con-tented.
               
               
                  Well, then, you consent to go back to Paris with me,
said the pupil.
               "If you are resolved to go," answered the governor, "to be sure I will go with you."
               "Now you are my friend again," said the young lord, hugging him:
I promise you, I will not stay long in Paris; but we must be Freeman and Melvil again, my dear Charle

dangerous attachment? but (added he, smiling) we must make our fellow-travellers a visit; these inns are charming places for shortening the ceremonies of a first introduction.
He rang the bell, without waiting for his friend's answer, and, one of his servants appearing, he ordered him to present Mr. Freeman's and his compliments to the two English ladies, with a request that they would permit them to wait upon them.
               Henrietta felt her heart flutter at this message; 
                     â€¢
                  et her natural reserve made her wish miss Bel-mour would decline the visit of these young gentlemen. However, that lady returned a civil answer, and permission for them to come.
               Henrietta, sensible of an agitation which she had never known before, would have chose not to have shared this visit; but it was not pos-sible to avoid it: miss Belmour had obliged her 
                     
                   throw off the character of a servant, and to 
                     â€¢
                  ve with her upon the footing of a friend and companion; to which Henrietta was in-
                  
                     â€¢
                  uced to consent, by the hope she had, that his familiarity would furnish her with oppor-tunities to guard her unhappy mistress against the evils into which her blind passion was hurry-ing her.
               
                  
To this mark of consideration and esteem miss Belmour added a most affectionate beha-viour, which entirely won the heart of the tender and grateful Henrietta: for nothing so much re-sembles true friendship, as those connexions which lovers form with persons whom they make the confidants of their passion.
               Thus circumstanced, Henrietta was obliged to receive the compliments of Mr. Melvil and his friend, as well as her lady, who, soon after, fell into a fit of musing, that made it necessary for our fair heroine to keep up the conversa-tion with the two gentlemen, which she did with that sprightliness and vivacity so natural to her.
               The graces of her wit, the easy elegance of her manners, and the modest dignity of her de-portment, formed new chains for the heart of Melvil. He looked on his friend with an ex-ulting air: his eyes challenged his admiration of the woman, whose merit justified the senti-ments he entertained for her.
               At parting, he told the ladies, that, sin

                   hoped they would allow him the pleasure of

Henrietta, who well remembered to have seen these travellers taking the very contrary route, was a little surprised at this declaration; but miss Belmour, absorbed in her own reflec-tions, was wholly ignorant of that circum-stance; and, considering this offer in no other light than that of general politeness, she re-ceived it with her usual complaisance.
               The youth and beauty of the two ladies made their apparent independent situation a matter of curiosity to Mr. Freeman, as well as the profound melancholy in which one of them seemed buried.
               Melvil was little concerned in these enqui-
                  
                     â€¢
                  ies; all his thoughts were taken up with the perfections he found in her who had charmed him; and he was much less solicitous to discover who she was, than how to make himself agreeable to her. He found she was not married, by the other lady's giving her the title of miss when she spoke to her; and he was perfectly satisfied with this knowledge. Conscious of the ardor with which he already loved this fair stranger, he was apprehensive of awakening the fears of his friend, by dwell-ing too long on her praises; but he received the testimony, which Freeman could not help giving to her merit, with such an undisguised

transport, as drew from him some serious ad-monitions, which he rallied off with a sprightly air, and then changed the discourse to a less in-teresting subject.

"Then I," said miss Courteney,
shall be always exposed to inconveniencies; for I am sure I can never bring myself to suspect persons who appear deserving of my good opinion: and indeed I think it is more honourable to be often deceived, than to be always doubting.
               
               "But it is not so safe," replied Mrs. Willis, smiling:
however, my dear, in unexperienced youth like yours this way of thinking is meri-torious; the faults of the world can only be learned by a long acquaintance with it, and by suffering from that acquaintance. Those who derive this kind of knowledge from the heart rather than the head, are indeed safe themselves, but dangerous to all others.
               
               
                  But I will keep you no longer in suspense, with regard to Mr. Bale. He has glossed over his behaviour so as to make me appear satisfied with it, which indeed it is necessary I should, if I would not wish to make an enemy of him; and a very powerful one he might be to my husband.
               
               
                  He asked for you as soon as he saw me, and did not seem surprised at the very slight excuse I made for your not seeing him. He expressed great concern for the treatment you had re-ceived from his wife; for in her frantic rage it

she was alone, to examine her own heart: miss Belmour had praised the personal graces of Mr. Melvil, and it was but justice to own, that he was eminently handsome; but was she weak enough to be dazzled with the beauty of a man? No, certainly; his countenance pleased her, because it was a picture of his mind; candor, sweetness, benevolence, shined in every feature: the politeness of his address, his gentle manners, that air so noble, yet so peculiarly soft and engaging, his good sense, and, above all, the justness and purity of his sentiments, which she had time enough to dis-cover during their conversation; were not these qualities which a modest young woman might esteem? and is love a necessary consequence of esteeming one of that sex? Must she deny herself the pleasure of approving virtue and merit, for fear of loving it too much? It was thus she argued, and soon dispelled those doubts which miss Belmour's raillery had raised in her mind.
               While Henrietta, under the notion of barely esteeming what was indeed truly worthy of esteem, was insensibly giving way to more tender sentments, Mr. Melvil, who loved with all the tenderness and ardor of a first passion, as his really was, burned with impatience

for the hour when they were to join the fair travellers: Freeman directed his attention to miss Belmour, which gave the young lover an opportunity of employing his whole care and assiduity about his mistress, who ascribed all to his natural politeness, and remained in a per-fect tranquility, as well with regard to his sen-timents as her own. Miss Belmour's experi-ence, however, soon let her into the secret of their hearts. Melvil's passion was indeed ap-parent enough, notwithstanding the pains he was at to conceal it, thro' fear of his friend's troublesome remonstrances; but Henrietta's, tho' hid from herself, was open to miss Bel-mour's discerning eyes, and she exulted in the discovery.
               This rigid censurer of her conduct; this in-flexibly virtuous maid, was entangled in the snares of love. She perceived that she herself was ignorant of her own danger, and she was resolved not to draw her out of this false secu-rity by any unseasonable railleries: for, how-ever useful the strict principles of Henrietta had been to her, yet she could not 
                     
                   the supe-riority they gave her; and she rejo
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  d in the hope, that a passion, perhaps as unfortunate placed as her own, would reduce 
                     
                   to a equality with her.
               
                  
Their journey now drew near a period: Melvil trembled at the thoughts of parting; he had indeed laid the foundation of an intimacy with the two ladies, which would give him a right to visit them in Paris; but he had been used to see the object of his passion continually, from the first moment of his acquaintance with her: and altho' they never separated till the evening, yet he thought the time amazingly long till they met again. How then would he be able to support an absence of two or three days, which decorum would oblige him to make the interval of his visits? besides, she was still ignorant of the sentiments she had in-spired him with. Hitherto he had never found an opportunity of speaking to her alone; but if one should offer, how could he declare himself to a woman, for whom he felt as much respect as love? yet one, whose birth he was igno-rant of, who seemed to be in a dependent situa-tion, whom he could not think of marrying, and whom he durst not wish to seduce.
               The difficulties he could not remove he endeavoured to banish from his thoughts; and, without considering what must be the event of the passion he was thus indulging, he for the present confined all his wishes to the pleasure of seeing her.
               
                  
Miss Belmour had often wondered that this young lover shewed so little solicitude to make opportunities of speaking to his mistress in pri-vate. She could not impute this behaviour to want of ardor; every look he gave her was expressive of the tenderness his soul was filled with: it was then respect, it was awe, it was fear of offending, that laid him under this re-straint. How glorious this for Henrietta how humiliating for her, who had scarce escaped falling a sacrifice to the dishonourable attempts of her lover! Was she then less capable of in-spiring a respectful passion than her woman? or did her charms act more powerfully on the heart she had subdued, than those of Henrietta? This question her self-love easily decided; and, from the same sentiment, she was persuaded that Henrietta, with all her boasted virtue, would defend herself as weakly against the lover her inclinations declared for, as the had done. Her present triumph, she thought, was 
                     
                   owe-ing to her own strength than her lover's weak-ness, who had not yet made a formal attack upon her heart: curiosity to know what effect the declaration of his passion would have, made her resolve to give him an opportunity of speak-ing to her in private. They were now within a day's journey of Paris. On their arrival at

the house where they were to dine, Mr. Free-man, as usual, went to give orders for their en-tertainment, and left Melvil with the two la-dies. Miss Belmour, pretending that she had a mind for some particular dish, ran after him, and kept him in conversation, that he might not interrupt the lovers, who being now for the first time alone together, were both equally embar-rassed.
               Henrietta cast down her eyes, surprised at the confusion in which she found herself, and shocked at the intelligence this new emotion gave her of the true state of her heart. Mr. Melvil approached her trembling; he could not resolve to lose so favourable an opportunity of declaring his sentiments to her: but the natural goodness and rectitude of his mind suggesting to him, that it was a kind of fraud to seek en-couragement of a passion, the design of which he was not himself able to answer for, he re-mained a few moments in suspence.
               This silence increased Henrietta's embarrass-ment, but suddenly reflecting upon the advan-tage it gave Mr. Melvil over her, she turned her eyes towards him, with a look, in which she endeavoured to throw as much indifference as possible, but which, nevertheless, had an unusual coldness in it; so that Melvil, partly

with-held by his extreme delicacy, and partly by the awe which this severe glance inspired him with, dropped, for that time, all thoughts of declaring his passion, and immediately entered into an indifferent conversation.
               Henrietta seemed as if relieved from a pain-ful load; her countenance resumed its former sweetness, and she talked to him with her usual vivacity; yet miss Belmour, at her return, saw some remains of her late uneasiness in her eyes: she observed too, that she spoke less to Mr. Melvil, and more to his friend than she did be-fore; that she studiously avoided the looks of the former; and that her behaviour to him was less free and obliging than it used to be. All this she looked upon as the play of coquetry; and in Mr. Melvil's apparent melancholy she saw its purpose and effect.
               But Henrietta taught by what passed in her own heart, during the few moments she was alone with Mr. Melvil, that she not only con-sidered him as a lover, but a 
                     
                   by his engaging qualities, 
                     
                   to strengthen her prepossession in 
                     
                  , by continuing to see and converse 
                     
                   Lord Bâ€”'s behaviour had given 
                     
                   of the disinterestedness of men. 
                     
                   at her own imprudence, in so 
                     
                   the

humble station that Providence had placed her in, as to entertain sentiments of tenderness for a man, who, from the inequality there was be-tween them, might think himself authorised to form expectations injurious to her honour: tho' her weakness was so lately known to herself, yet she fancied it had been perceived by others before, and that even Mr. Melvil had discovered the preference with which she regarded him. It was this thought which made her so suddenly alter her behaviour; but as indifference is, of all dispositions of the mind, the hardest to feign, Melvil imputed the apparent constraint in her manner to some disgust he had unhap-pily given her, and miss Belmour to the artifice of a coquet.
               Henrietta, who was far from imagining she over-acted her part, continued, during the whole time they were at dinner, to avoid her lover's looks, so carefully that he had no oppor-tunity to make her comprehend by them, how much he was concerned at her extraordinary coldness. However, she could not, without affectation, refuse him her hand when they left the inn; but they followed Mr. Freeman and miss Belmour so close, that it was not possible for him to speak to her without being over-heard; and he in vain sought her eyes: they

were always directed another way. He sighed when he helped her into the chaise; and if she had not turned her face from him that moment, the blush with which it was overspread, would have shewn him that she took but too much no-tice of that sigh.
               "You are melancholy, Henrietta," said miss Belmour, after looking at her in silence for a long time, attentive to the motions of her mind, which might be easily read in her counte-nance.
               "Am I, madam?" replied she, with a sigh half suppressed, and a gentle smile.
               "Yes, indeed, are you," resumed miss Bel-mour, mimicking the languid accent in which she spoke;
and I don't remember that I ever saw you so before.
               
               
                  And yet I have many causes for melan-choly, madam,
replied Henrietta, whose heart was full, and she eagerly grasped at this opportunity to relieve herself by tears; tears, which she supposed she gave to the remembrance of her misfortunes, without asking herself, why that remembrance was more poignant now than before.
               "Ah! Henrietta," said miss Belmour, shaking her head,
your heart has undergone a great change within these few daysâ€” You are 
                        â€¢â€¢
                     
                     

love, my dear.
"Is it possible, madam," cried Henrietta, hastily, her fair face all crim-soned over,
that you have discovered?â€” Do you think thatâ€” Then, to be sure, Mr. Melvil.â€”
She stopped abruptly, and cast down her eyes: the mention of that name seemed to lead her to a consciousness, that she had be-trayed herself.
               Miss Belmour was affected with her beauti-ful simplicity.
Don't be ashamed, my dear Henrietta,
said she, taking her hand,
to speak freely to me. From me (added she, sighing) you may be sure of indulgence.
               
               "No, madam, no," interrupted Henrietta, with great earnestness,
I would not seek in-dulgence for my weaknesses: but I conjure you, madam,
pursued she, with tears that in spite of her endeavours would force their way,
suffer me to return to that humble sta-tion, from which your partial kindness raised meâ€” You have made me forget I was a ser-vantâ€” It does not become me to view with sensibility the merit of persons so greatly above me, But you shall find, madam, that I will repair this error, and that my conduct shall be such as may render me not unworthy your esteem.
               
               
                  
Notwithstanding the delicate turn which Hen-rietta gave to a declaration, which shewed she was determined early to conquer her passion, yet miss Belmour considered it as a triumph over her, who had not been capable of acting with equal prudence.
               
                  It is happy for you (said she, coldly) that you need no assistance to help you to keep your passions in subjection; but I owe you too many obligations for the good counsel you have given me, to permit you to appear in any other character than that of my friend.
               
               Henrietta's mind was in so much agitation, that she did not take in the full sense of this an-swer, but struck with the obliging purport of the last words of it, she expressed her gratitude in terms full of tenderness and respect.
               The sight of Paris drew them both out of a long silence, which had succeeded a conversa-tion with which neither had been pleased: Hen-rietta, because it had discovered so much weak-ness on her side; miss Belmour, because it had shewn so little.

seems she told him all that had passed between you.
               
               "You find," said he,
I did not exaggerate my wife's failing.
               
               "It is a great misfortune," replied I;
but, sir, I think if you had not made a secret of your connections with miss Courteney, Mrs. Bale's jealousy would not have had so plausible an excuse, nor would the young lady have had any reason to complain of you.
               
               "I should have found it absolutely impossible," said he,
to have concerned myself in miss Cour-teney's affairs, or been of the least use to her, had my wife known any thing of the matter; the very fight of miss Courteney would have roused her suspicions, and have put it out of my power to act either as a friend or guardian by her; and, in her unhappy situation, she had great need of my care and attention.
               
               "However, sir," replied I,
it was cer-tainly ill judged to conceal from miss Cour-teney, that you was married: what must she think of such a strange conduct?
               
               "Why, Mrs. Willis," resumed he,
I have already told you, that I could not own my mar-riage to miss Courteney, without letting her into my reasons for not being able to offer her an asylum in my house, during her aunt's dis-pleasure,

refuse him her hand, seized it with trembling haste; and, as he led her into the house, ven-tured to press it with his lips, unperceived by any one else. Henrietta, imputing this bold-nes's to the discovery he had made of her sen-timents, pulled her hand away hastily, giving him a look at the same time that expressed her resentment; but all her anger could not pre-vent her from being affected with the soft lan-guor that appeared in his face, and the submis-sive manner in which he had yielded to the effort she made to withdraw her hand.
               Miss Belmour, at parting, told them, she hoped to see them again in a day or two, when she should be settled. Her Parisian friend soon procured her convenient lodgings, and, at her desire, recommended to her a Femme de Cham-bre, among the other servants he provided her, which Henrietta in vain opposed; but fixed in her design to avoid Mr. Melvil, she took care to be seldom in the way when he came.
               Miss Belmour blamed her for this conduct.
You will make the man think you love him, and are afraid of him (said she) by flying him.
               
               If I loved him, madam," replied Hen-rietta, blushing,
is it not prudence to avoid him?
               
               
                  
"Why, I don't know," said miss Belmour,
Mr. Melvil certainly loves you; and, what-ever inequality there may be in your condi-tions, yet love is a great leveller: he may possibly intend to marry you.
               
               
                  It is not fit I should suppose he has any such design, madam,
resumed Henrietta,
since it is highly improbable; and I will not expose myself to the danger of being de-ceived. I have some-where read (added she, smiling) that in love flight is victory; and this way at least I shall be sure to conquer.
               
               Miss Belmour, who knew how difficult it was to be in love and be wise, laughed at a re-solution, which she did not think it would be always in her power to maintain. Poor Hen-rietta, who had so artlessly laid open her heart, was often exposed to the most poignant raillery from her; but at length she was delivered from this kind of persecution by a surprising alteration in miss Belmour herself.
               This young lady, who had fled from her lover, rather with a hope of stimulating his pas-sion than of subduing her own, though she en-deavoured to impose upon herself in believing the latter to be the true motive of her conduct, fell into a most violent despair, when she found

that, far from following her, he did not even seek a reconciliation by writing to her. Sick of herself, the world, and tired of her exist-ence, she mistook the agitations of a heart tortured by jealousy, disappointment, and the pangs of slighted love, for the motions of grace and the genuine marks of repentance. She neglected her dress, took no pleasure in any amusement, avoided company, and spent whole hours in her closet, where she wept and prayed by turns.
               She told Henrietta, that the world and all its pleasures were grown insipid to her; that her whole soul was filled with divine love; and that the thoughts and exercises of religion made up all her happiness. She then passionately re-gretted that there were no religious communi-ties among the protestants, where a mind that was weaned from this sublunary world, and all its vanities, might freely indulge its pious con-templations, and devote itself entirely to Hea-ven. "Oh, how happy are the nuns!" she exclaimed;
how I envy them! Sure nothing can be more delightful, when persons are truly pious, than to live in a religious society excluded from all commerce with a world they must certainly despise. I think I should be perfectly happy if I was in a cloister.
               
               
                  
Henrietta congratulated her upon her new sentiments, but endeavoured to prove that there was more merit in passing through life with in-nocence, and in rightly performing 
                     
                  , than in flying to the gloomy solitude

                  rs, and the exercises of religion performed as a penance. She recommended to her the study of the scriptures, and put some practical trea-tises of religion, written by the best authors on that subject, into her hands: but the zeal of this new convert was so flaming, that nothing would serve her but a total retirement from the world; and she made such frequent visits to a convent, where a friend of her's had lately taken the veil, that Henrietta was apprehensive the nuns would discover the true state of her mind and take advantage of her passions to pervert he
                     â€¢
                   principles, and secure her to themselves.
               While these whims possessed her, she was so inaccessible to all visiters, that Mr. Melvil could with difficulty get admittance. Freeman saw the progress of his passion with great uneasiness and, finding that he could not be prevailed upon to leave Paris, resolved to write to his father and give him a hint of the dangerous attach
                     â€¢
                  ment his son had formed, that he might se

him a peremptory command to return to Eng-land; but before he could execute this design, Melvil, to his great surprise, told him, that he would leave Paris in two days. The poor youth expected his friend would have expressed some joy at this news; and, being disappointed at his receiving with indifference what had cost him so many pangs to resolve upon,
               "You make me no compliments," said he, with a tender smile,
upon the conquest I have gained over my inclinations: do you think I can banish myself from miss Benson without concern?
               
               
                  I am sure I cannot hear you speak in this manner without concern,
replied Freeman.
Is it fit for a young man of your rank to entertain a serious liking for a woman, to whose birth and character you are an absolute stranger.
               
               "There is not a man in the world," resumed Melvil, eagerly,
who need to blush for lov-ing miss Benson; her person, beautiful as it is, is the least of her charms; that mingled sweetness and dignity in her manners, that graceful modesty which distinguishes every word and action of her's, exalt her above all the women I have ever seen. You have

heard her talk, and you could not help own-ing that you thought her very sensible.
               
               "Well, but what is all this to the purpose?" interrupted Freeman;
what signifies attri-buting such goddess-like perfections to an ob-scure girl, whom, if you were at liberty to dispose of yourself, you would not, I suppose, be so mad as to marry: your fortune would enable you to make other proposals, less un-worthy of yourself, though advantageous e-nough for a young woman in her dependent situation.
               
               "May I perish," replied Melvil, with some emotion,
if I would degrade such excellence to a mistress; but if I were capable of such a design, her virtue, I am sure, is incorruptible. Have you not observed with what care she shuns me? She knows I love her, but she knows not with what purity I love her; and, conscious of her situation, she is afraid I should take advantage of it to declare myself in a manner that would wound her delicacy.â€” Charming creature, how I love her!â€” In-deed, my dear Freeman, it is time to be gone.
               
               "I see it plainly," replied Freeman,
you are grown quite romantickâ€” We will set ou

notions you have entertained, I think you ought not to trust yourself here any longer.
               
               The lover consented with a sigh, but at the same time put his friend in mind, that civility obliged them to go and take leave of the ladies. Freeman could not reasonably oppose his mak-ing this visit; and, after he had given proper directions to the servants for their journey the next day, he accompanied him to miss Belmour's lodgings.

                  In which miss Belmour acts the part of a true female friend.
               
               THEY found the two ladies together: Henrietta could not, without affectation, avoid her lover that day, as she was in the room when he came in; and he, who had not been so fortunate for several days before, found so much delight in looking at her and hearing her speak, that he forgot he came to pay a farewel visit, which Mr. Freeman observing, took care to mention their design of leaving Paris the next day.
               
                  
Melvil's gaiety was immediately over-cast, Henrietta turned pale, Freeman was attentive to his friend's emotions, and only miss Belmour had freedom of mind enough lest to speak. She said some civil things upon the occasion, which Freeman answered; for Melvil continued silent, with his eyes fixed upon Henrietta, who had bent her's towards the ground: conscious of the emotion with which she had heard the news of their intended departure, she durst no

                   look up, lest the person, from whom she was most solici-tous to hide her concern, should read it 
                     
                   plainly in her countenance.
               Recovering herself at length, upon miss Bel-mour's taking occasion to thank them anew fo

                   the civilities she had received from them during their journey from Calais, she added a few word
                     â€¢
                   to her compliment; but, in doing so, her eye slightly glanced over Mr. Melvil, and directed their looks full upon his friend.
               The conversation was dull enough during tw

                   hours that they stayed; and Freem

                   Henrietta, trembling. She turned pale and 
                     
                   successively; a soft sigh stole from her. Melv

was in too much emotion to observe her's: he saluted her with an air of solemn respect; but, as she retired a step back, a sudden impulse, which he could not resist, made him take her hand; he pressed it to his lips with passionate tenderness, and, sighing, quitted the room with the utmost precipitation.
               Henrietta's eyes overflowed; she made haste to wipe them before miss Belmour, who attended the gentlemen as far as the door of her anti-chamber, returned.
               "Ah! my poor Henrietta," said that young lady, who perceived she had been weeping,
I pity youâ€”What sordid wretches are these men! Melvil loves you, and yet he is able to leave you; nay, I am persuaded he has discovered your tenderness for himâ€”What monstrous in-gratitude! you ought to hate him, my dear.
               
               "You bid me hate him, madam," replied Henrietta, smiling,
yet say every thing that can confirm me in a favourable opinion of him. If he loves me, and has seen any weakness in me , he gives the best proof of his love in not seeking to take advantage of that weakness.
               
               Miss Belmour, who thought this a strange way 
                     â€¢
                  f reasoning, answered no otherwise than by a 
                     â€¢
                  ignificant smile, which seemed to say she was re-

                  olved to justify him at any rate; while Hen-rietta,

finding in her lover's behaviour a delicac

                   uneasiness, that his pupil, who till then ha

                   this sudden intemperance should have any

                   effect on his health. As soon as it was light, I went to his bed-side, and found him with all th

                   symptoms of a feverish disorder upon him, which the agitations of his mind had contribute more perhaps than the liquor of which he

                   drank so freely.
               All thoughts of their journey were now lai

an offer she had great reason to ex-pect. I was unwilling to expose my wife's foible, and to raise scruples in the young lady's mind, which might prevent her from receiving those little services from me which she had so much need of: I hope you will re-present all this to her, and let her know how greatly I am afflicted at what she has suf-fered.
               
               
                  To be sure I will, replied I; but miss Cour-teney tells me you have received letters from Mr. Bale, in which he acquaints you that there are some foreign merchants coming to re-side in my house; and that she was to be re-moved for that reason. I surprised her greatly, by saying I had heard nothing of it; and, in-deed I am a good deal surprised myself at it.
               
               "Why, to be plain with you, Mrs. Willis," said the young gentleman,
this was only an invention.
               
               "Indeed!" said I, looking very grave:
to be sure you had some good reason for it.
               
               "Doubtless I had," pursued he,
and you yourself shall be judge of my reason.â€”This is a bad world, Mrs. Willis, a very bad world: nothing but stratagems and designs, fraud and cunning. Our sex, Mrs. Willis, is in a state of war with yours, our arms are sighs and

that she would not be a very difficult con-quest.
               He shut his eyes upon all that was wrong in this proceeding; and, considering nothing but the interest of his friend, he thought it less dan-gerous to give him a mistress, than to trust him to the fantastic power of his passion, which might hurry him on to a clandestine marriage.

                  they should know, I will wait on them this a

                      Paris so much longer than we intended.
               
               Melvil affected to receive this proposal w
                     â€¢
                   indifference; but his friend observed, that 
                     
                   was more chearful than before, and doubted 
                     
                   but he expected the news of his illness w
                     â€¢
                   have some effect on Henrietta.
               
                  
He went at the usual hour, and was immedi-ately admitted: "you are in Paris still, then!" exclaimed miss Belmour, in a joyful accent, as soon as Freeman entered her apartment,
I am excessively glad of it, I hope your agreeable friend is with you.
               
               Freeman, a little disappointed at not seeing Henrietta with her, answered coldly, that Mr. Melvil had been indisposed, which obliged them to delay their journey.
               "I fancy," said miss Belmour, with an arch 
                     â€¢
                  et,
that the air of Paris is mighty necessary for your friend at this time, you are in the wrong to hurry him away.
               
               
                  You have a great deal of penetration, ma-dam,
replied Mr. Freeman, smiling,
you have guessed the cause of his illness, I believe.
               
               "I believe I have," resumed miss Belmour,
and perhaps I could tell him something that might contribute to forward his recovery.
               
               Freeman began now to think his scheme was 
                     
                   a hopeful way.
To be sincere with you, madam,
said he, with a graver look and 
                     â€¢
                  cent,
Mr. Melvil is desperately in love with miss Benson.
               
               "Poor man!" cried miss Belmour, laughing,

                     
                        â€¢
                     he is to be pitied truly, for miss Benson is most desperately in love with him likewise.
               
               
                  
"How happy would this news make him!" exclaimed Freeman.
Am I, madam, at liberty to tell him?
               
               "Certainly," replied miss Belmour,
I told you for that purpose; and now what do you think of my frankness?
               
               "I adore you for it, madam," said Freeman, taking her hand, which (encouraged by her be-haviour) he kissed with great liberty. "Ah!" pursued he, looking at her tenderly,
what additional charms does kindness give to beauty!
               
               "I hear miss Benson on the stairs," said mis
                     â€¢
                   Belmour, withdrawing her hand;
I will give you an opportunity to plead your friend's cause: remember what I have told you, and don't be discouraged by a little affectation.
               
               She stopped upon Henrietta's entrance, wh
                     â€¢
                   started at the sight of Mr. Freeman, and immediately after her fair face was covered wit
                     â€¢
                   blushes.
               
                  You see we have not lost our good friend yet,
said miss Belmour. Henrietta on
                     â€¢â€¢
                   smiled. "I must desire you, my dear," pursu
                     â€¢â€¢
                   that young lady,
to entertain Mr. Freemanâ–ª I ordered some trades-people to attend 
                        
                      about this time.
               
               
                  
She hurried out of the room when she had said this, not without some confusion for the part she had acted; to account for which, it is necessary the reader should know that the mind of this young lady had undergone another re-volution, within the few days of Mr. Melvil's illness.
               A letter from her lover, filled with tender complaints, and new assurances of everlasting fidelity, had banished all thoughts of devotion and a convent. She had answered it immedi-ately without communicating it to Henrietta; her transport at finding herself still beloved, and the fear of disgusting him by any new coldness, hurried her on to the most fatal resolutions. She invited him to come to Paris to her; and, not doubting but he would instantly obey her sum-mons, she was now only solicitous how to re-concile Henrietta to her conduct, and oblige her to keep her secret.
               The unexpected news of Mr. Melvil's being still in Paris, and Mr. Freeman's acknowledg-ment of his friend's passion for Henrietta, an-swered all her views. She imputed the reserve Henrietta had been enabled to maintain, less to her own virtue than to the unenterprising temper of her lover; and was persuaded that the disco-very she had made of her tenderness for him,

would put the affair upon such a footing, as to make her less rigid in her remonstrances with re-spect to Mr. Campley.

                  Which contains a very interesting discovery.
               
               FREEMAN, though persuaded that miss Bel-mour was a woman of intrigue, and by con-sequence entertaining no elevated idea of her companion, yet found himself so awed by the modesty that shone in her countenance, and the dignity of her person and manner, that he was at some loss how to introduce the subject which had brought him thither. Henrietta, however, innocently led him to it, by expressing her sur-prise to see him still in Paris.
               "You say nothing of my friend, madam," said Freeman;
and this indifference with re-gard to him is a very bad omen.
               
               "I hope Mr. Melvil is well," said Henrietta gravely, without seeming to take any notice o
                     â€¢
                   the strange speech he had made.
               
                  He is better than he was three or four day
                        â€¢
                      ago,
replied Freeman,
when his phys
                        â€¢
                     
                     cians despaired of his life.
               
               
                  
"Bless me!" cried Henrietta, with an emo-tion she could not suppress,
has Mr. Melvil been so ill then? I am extremely concerned to hear it.
               
               "You would, no doubt," said Freeman,
be more concerned if you knew you were the cause.
               
               "This kind of raillery, Mr. Freeman," re-plied Henrietta, a little confused,
is not at all agreeable to me, I assure you.
               
               "By Heaven I am serious," resumed Free-man;
my friend loves you with the utmost ardor: I am a witness to the birth and pro-gress of his passion, and to his fruitless endea-vours to conquer it. The effort he made to leave Paris, has almost cost him his life; he was taken ill the evening before our intended departure. Oh, miss Benson! had you heard with what tenderness he called upon your name, when the violence of his fever had de-prived him of his senses, I am sure you must have pitied him.
               
               Freeman perceived by the changes in Hen-rietta's countenance, that she did not hear him without emotion. He paused, in expectation of some pretty affected answer, that would give hope while it seemed to destroy it; but Hen-rietta,

with a composed look and accent, re-plied,
               
                  If I am to believe this account of your friend's illness not exaggerated, permit me to ask you, sir, what is your design by making me acquainted with his sentiments, and what you expect from me upon this occasion?
               
               Freeman was a little disconcerted by this speech, and at the manner in which she delivered it; but, relying on the intelligence he had re-ceived from miss Belmour,
               
                  I expect you will have compassion on my friend (said he) and give him an opportunity to declare to you himself the passion you have inspired him with.
               
               
                  I will be very free with you, Mr. Free-man,
replied Henrietta;
your ready con-currence with your friend in the liking you say he has entertained for me, is not consistent with your good sense and prudence. Mr. Melvil is a young man of rank and fortune; I am poor and dependent; my birth perhaps greatly inferior to his. Will his parents, think you, approve of such a choice?
               
               
                  What has parents to do with a tender en-gagement?
interrupted Freeman;
an engagement in which the heart only 
                        
                      consulted.
               
               
                  

                  Were my heart ever so well disposed in fa-vour of your friend,
resumed Henrietta, not willing to understand him,
I would not re-ceive his addresses without the sanction of his parents' consent.
               
               Freeman could hardly help smiling at this formal declaration; and, supposing that the best way to drive these strange notions out of her head, was to acquaint her with Melvil's quality, which he likewise expected would have no small influence over her,
               
                  It is not fit (said he) that you should be any longer ignorant of the rank of him whom your charms have subjected. Melvil is not the name of my friend; he is the heir of an illustrious title and a great estate: he loves you, he will make your fortune; do not throw away this opportunity of freeing yourself from poverty and dependance, nor let a romantic notion of virtue deprive you of the advantages that are offered you.
               
               "Hold, sir," interrupted Henrietta, rising from her chair,
this insult is too plain; I ought not to have listened to you so long.
She spoke this with tolerable composure; but, finding her tears begin to flow, she turned aside to conceal them, and hastily wiping her eyes,

she looked on him again with a kind of calm disdain.
               
                  I know not (said she) what weakness you have discovered in my behaviour to encourage you to make me such shocking proposal; but I may venture to tell you, though I am not the mistress of this apartment, that the doors of it shall never be open to you again.
               
               She was hurrying out of the room when she had spoke this, leaving Freeman in so much confusion, that he knew not what to say to her, when miss Belmour entered with a letter in her hand.
               
                  Do you know a gentleman of the name of Bale (said she to Henrietta) who is at present at Montpelier?
               
               "I do, madam," replied she, looking eagerly at the letter.
               "Then this letter is for you, I suppose, said miss Belmour,
it was inclosed in anothe
                        â€¢
                      to me, and directed to my banker's: 
                        
                      your name Courteney? you see the superscription is for miss Courteney.
               
               "The letter is certainly for me, madamâ–ª said Henrietta, blushing.
               
                  

vows, and flattery and protestation, and (as in all other warfares) we fight to destroy.
               
               "Bless us," interrupted Henrietta, half smil-ing, "what could this fine preface lead to?"
               "I protest," resumed Mrs. Willis laughing,
it was with the utmost difficulty I composed my countenance to a look of grave attention; while he uttered all this with a solemn accent, and an air of infinite importance.
               
               
                  Truly sir, replied I, for so young a gentle-man you think very gravely of these matters: it is highly commendable in one of your years.
               
               "Heaven forbid, Mrs. Willis," said he,
that all men should be libertines; but in short it was to preserve miss Courteney from falling into the snares of one, that I formed an ex-cuse for sending her into the country.
               
               "Vile dissembler!" exclaimed miss Courteney again, glowing with indignation;
preserve me from falling into the snares of a libertine! I hope my own discretion, without any aid from him, was sufficient to guard me against any snares that a libertine could lay for me.
               
               "I hope so too," said Mrs. Willis.
               Henrietta blushed a little at this expression, which seemed, she thought, to imply a doubt, but would not interrupt Mrs. Willis again.
               
                  
"Oh! then," replied miss Belmour, smiling, and giving it to her,
I have discovered a secret, I find.
               
               Henrietta retired immediately; and miss Bel-mour approached Mr. Freeman, who stood leaning over his chair, with his eyes fixed on the ground,
               
                  What is the matter with you? (said she) you look excessively pale.
               
               "Where is miss Benson, madam?" said he, starting out of his revery at the sound of her voice.
               "She is in her own chamber, I believe," re-plied miss Belmour;
but did you take notice of what passed about the letter, I delivered it to her before you on purpose: you see she in a manner owned that Courteney is her true name; is not this strange?
               
               "I must beg leave to speak to her again," said he, interrupting her, and making towards the door, "which way, pray madam?"
               Miss Belmour followed him, surprised at the agitation he appeared to be in; and, pointing to a room just opposite, "you will find her there," said she.
               Freeman opened the door without any cere-mony; Henrietta, who was reading her letter,

looked up at the noise he made in entering:
this is extremely rude, sir (said she) I desire you will instantly be gone, and trouble me no more.
But, apprehensive that he would not quit her so easily, she rushed by him, and was running to the room in which she had left miss Belmour: he took hold of her hand, to prevent her leaving him; and she was upon the point of expressing her resentment at the inso-lence of this treatment, in harsher terms than any she had yet used, when she saw tears gush in great abundance from his eyes. Me
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢
                   at this sight, she stood still, but endeavoured to disengage her hand, looking at him earnestly, and in the utmost astonishment.
               "O my sister!" cried he at last, bursting into a fresh flood of tears;
my dear, dear sisterâ€”He was not able to utter a word more, but led her gently back to her chamber, which she permitted, trembling, confused, and full of anxious expectation.
               "How strangely you look upon me!" said he,
do you doubt whether I am your bro-ther?
               
               "I know not what to think," replied she, shrinking from his embrace; for he had folded his arms about her.
               
                  
"Dear girl!" cried he,
how amiable is this sweet reserveâ€”these modest doubtsâ€” but it is certain I am your brother, my Hen-rietta: is it possible your memory retains no traces of my features? in your's, methinks I see a lively resemblance of my dear mother. How dull was I that I did not discover it be-fore! but how could I expect to meet you in France, in such a situation, and under a dis-guised name! Oh! my dear sister, these circumstances distract meâ€” Good Heaven! what a part have I actedâ€” I perceive you are still perplexed,
pursued he, after a little pause; and, taking a miniature picture out of his pocket,
You will certainly be able to re-collect your mother's picture (said he) which she gave me at parting.
               
               Henrietta looked at the picture, kissed it, and then threw herself in tears upon her brother's neckâ€”
Forgive my doubts (said she) it is many years since I have seen you, we were children when we parted, but now I am con-vinced you are my brother: my heart tells me so without this dear testimony,
pursued she, kissing again the picture of her mother, which she still held; then suddenly clasping her hands together, and lifting up her fine eyes, which were swimming in tears,
I thank thee,

my God! (said she) for restoring to me my brother:
and, turning again to him with an affectionate look,
a few moments ago (said she) I thought myself very unhappy, but now you will be a friend and protector to me.
               
               He tenderly kissed her cheekâ€”
What a wretch have I been!
said he, sighingâ€”
Indeed, my dear sister, I never shall forgive myself for having ignorantly practised on your virtue.
               
               "Oh! that my brother," replied Henrietta,
would be taught by this accident never more to form designs against innocence; and, in cases like mine, to consider every virtuous young woman as a sister.
               
               Mr. Courteney, for so we shall now call him, was extremely moved at these words. He gazed at her some moments with mingled tenderness and delight; but all on a sudden, as if struck with some painful reflection,
               "Henrietta," said he, with a look and accent greatly altered from his former sweetness,
why came you to France? and how has it happened that you are so intimately connected with thi
                        â€¢
                      woman, this miss Belmour?
               
               
                  Why, do you know any harm of mis
                        â€¢
                      Belmour?
said Henrietta, frighted at h
                     â€¢â€¢
                   sternness.
               
                  
"You don't answer my question," replied he, peevishly.
               "Alas! my dear brother," said Henrietta,
I have a long and melancholy story to tell you: I have been reduced to great distress; my aunt, with whom you supposed me so hap-pily settled, has treated me unkindly: I must confess, indeed, I have not been wholly free from blame; but you shall know all some other time. As for miss Belmour, I was re-commended to herâ€” I would not shock you, brother; but I have been obliged to go to service, and I was recommended to miss Belmour by two ladies of quality, her near relations.
               
               Mr. Courteney sighed deeply at this account, and remained for several moments silent; at length recovering himself,
               
                  Miss Belmour, it seems (said he) did not always know your real nameâ€”You appear to be on the footing of a companion.
               
               
                  Miss Belmour was pleased to take a liking to me,
said Henrietta;
and, though ig-norant of my birth, would not suffer me to continue with her in the character of a servant â€”I have been greatly obliged to her.
               
               "Yes, you are obliged to her," interrupted Mr. Courteney, kindling into rage at the re-membrance

of what had parted between them;
infamous wretch! she has done her part to-wards betraying you to ruin. You have been very imprudent, Henrietta; you have talked to her of Mr. Melvil too freely: she believes you are in love with him, and told me so, to encourage my attempts upon you.
               
               Henrietta blushed at the mention of Mr. Melvil, and presently after burst into tears at this discovery of miss Belmours baseness and in-gratitude, but uttered not a word of complaint or resentment.
               
                  I will not suffer you to remain any longer with her,
resumed Mr. Courteney;
I will go directly and provide you lodgings in the house of a worthy English family: I sup-pose you can have no objection to this pro-posal.
               
               
                  Why do you look and speak so coldly, my dear brother?
said Henrietta:
to be sure I can have no objection; dispose of me as you please, you are in the place of my father, I will obey you as such.
               
               "Forgive me, my dear," said he, tenderly pressing her hand,
my temper is warm; I have spoke to you harshly: indeed I am greatly alarmed at the disagreeable circum-stances I find you in, you have been to blame,

you own. Alas! my dear sister, what have you done to be thus abandoned by your aunt. I shall be on the rack till I have heard all your story; but this is not a proper placeâ€” Take a civil leave of miss Belmour, but do not acquaint her that you have discovered your brother, for I know not yet what measures I shall take; I will call for you in less than an hour in a coach.
               
               Henrietta promised to be ready; he took a tender leave of her, and departed.

                  The history continued.
               
               OUR fair heroine continued some time alone in her chamber, so transported at this un-expected meeting with her brother, that she sometimes doubted whether her happiness was real, and whether all that had part was not an illusion of her fancy. When her spirits were a little composed, she began to consider what rea-son she should give miss Belmour for quitting her so suddenly: she rightly judged that the se-crecy her brother had recommended to her, pro-ceeded

from his embarrassment with regard to Mr. Melvil; and she resolved, however strange her going away might appear to miss Belmour, to follow his directions punctually.
               The treachery this young lady had been guilty of towards her, excited less resentment than grief for the conviction it brought her, that her principles were not changed. Several circum-stances now rushed upon her memory, which served to convince her she was relapsing into her former indiscretions; and she doubted not but miss Belmour would be rejoiced to be delivered from her presence. This thought gave her cou-rage to go to her immediately, and acquaint her with her intention.
               
                  A strange alteration has happened in my af-fairs, madam,
said she, entering her apart-ment, "within this hour."
               
                  That letter has brought you some good news, I suppose,
said miss Belmour, coldly.
               
                  It came from a dear and worthy friend madam,
replied Henrietta;
and I have in-deed heard some good news, which I little expected: but I am obliged to leave you and so suddenly, that I am afraid you will thin
                        â€¢
                      me ungrateful for your kindness, in submitting to this necessity.
               
               
                  
"Pray make no apologies," interrupted miss Belmour, with great indifference,
you are en-tirely at your own liberty.
               
               Henrietta, who thought she had reason for this behaviour, was studying for some answer, which, without revealing the secret motive of her conduct, might tend in some measure to excuse it; when a servant introduced a gentle-man into the room, who, though she had seen but once, she knew immediately to be Mr. Campley. She turned eagerly to observe how miss Belmour was affected by this visit; and dis-covering no signs of surprise or anger in her countenance, but an excess of joy and satisfac-tion, she concluded this meeting was concerted, and retired immediately, in great concern, to her own room.
               Here, while she waited her brother's return, she employed herself in writing to miss Belmour. In this letter she repeated what she had often urged before, to guard her against the base de-signs of her lover: she recalled to her remem-brance the resolution she had made, and the vows with which she had sealed it, never more to listen to his destructive addresses; and conjured her, by every motive of religion, honour, and virtue, to banish from her sight a man whose only aim was to ruin her.
               
                  
She had scarce finished her letter, when a servant came to tell her, that some company waited for her in a coach. She made haste to seal it, and gave it to miss Belmour's maid, with orders to deliver it to her lady. At the door she found her brother, who helped her into the coach, and came in after her. He asked her, smiling, how she had parted with miss Bel-mour?
               Henrietta told him, she had left her with company.
It is indifferent to me what company she sees now you are not with her,
said he:
but my heart will not be at rest till I hear all your story, sister.
               
               Henrietta promised to satisfy him when they were arrived at her new lodgings.
I am also impatient (said she) to know your adventures; why you called yourself Freeman, and what was the cause of your not writing to me for so many months past.
               
               
                  To say the truth, my dear sister (said he) I have been guilty of a little neglect in no
                        â€¢
                      writing to you oftener: however, some of my letters must certainly have miscarried; for wrote to you both from Brussels and Genoa and I don't remember I had any answer, Th

                      account you gave me of Mr. Bal

                     's kindne
                        â€¢
                      in taking upon him the office of your guar-dian,

                  I told you that this gentleman was very art-ful,
continued the good woman,
as you will be convinced by the story he told.
               
               "You must know," said he to me, looking extremely wise, and lowering his voice,
that when I waited upon miss Courteney at the lodgings she had taken after she left her aunt, I observed a fine gay young man there, who followed me when I went out, and looked at me in a manner that shewed great curiosity and attention. It came into my head that this might be the spark of whom miss Cour-teney's aunt was apprehensive: I discovered that he lodged in the house with the young lady; and this circumstance I liked by no means. I resolved to remove her immedi-ately, and place her with you: she so readily consented to my proposal that I doubted whe-ther I had not been extremely mistaken in my conjectures concerning this young gentle-man; but a day or two after she was settled with you, my spark came to enquire for her at my house: now it was plain that miss Courteney held some correspondence with him, otherwise he could not have known where to come after her.
               
               
                  I happened not to be at home, and the servants told him, that no such person was

and your happy settlement with lady Mea-dows, made me perfectly easy with regard to you. I had informed you that I was appointed governor to the marquis of â€”: this young nobleman had contracted a friendship with me during his stay at Leyden, where his governor dying, he wrote to his father the duke ofâ€”, in such pressing terms in my favour, which, joined to the knowledge of my birth, and very high recommendations from the university, had so much weight with him, that his grace, notwithstanding my youth, appointed me go-vernor to his son, with a salary of five hun-dred pounds a year. I have endeavoured to acquit myself faithfully of this trust; my pupil and I have always lived together like brothers; and I flatter myself his father will have no cause to repent his having consigned him to my care.
               
               
                  But why did you take the names of Melvil and Freeman?
interrupted Henrietta.
               "The marquis," replied Mr. Courteney,
had an inclination to travel without the pa-rade of quality, that he might, as he wrote to his father, make nearer and more useful observations upon men and manners; and, being indulged in this scheme, we have tra-velled thro' France and Italy under those

names, and with a very small equipage, And now, Henrietta, that you know the quality of my friend, I expect you will not entertain any ridiculous hopes from the liking he has expressed for you. I will do him the justice to own that he never formed any dishonoura-ble designs upon you. The character of the woman you lived with, encouraged me to make you some shocking proposals. You be-haved very properly; but, my dear sister, no words can express my anguish and confusion, when I heard you own the name of Courte-ney, and your connexions with Mr. Baleâ€” Good Heaven! what did I not suffer at that momentâ€” What a wretch did I seem in my own eyes!
               
               
                  Let not this cruel remembrance disturb you now, my dear brother,
said Henrietta;
I am so happy in finding you, that I forget all my past uneasinesses.
               
               Her looks bore delightful witness to the truth of what she said. Joy sparkled in her charm
                     â€¢
                  
                  ing eyes, heightened the rosy bloom of he
                     â€¢
                   complexion, and animated her whole air: but clearly as she loved her brother, the assurance he gave her, that her lover had no part in th
                     â€¢
                   dishonourable proposals he had made her, was

circumstance that greatly increased her satisfac-tion in this meeting.
               Mr. Courteney looked at her with admiration and delight, while a tender sense of the mis-fortunes she had been exposed to, almost melted him into tears. As soon as the coach stopped, he told her, that the master of the house they were going into was a very worthy man, with whom he was intimately acquainted, and whose prudence he could depend upon.
His wife (pursued he) is a virtuous, sensible wo-man: I know no family so proper to place you in as this; and it was extremely lucky that I thought of them upon this occasion, for it was not fit you should stay with miss Belmour, and in so short a time it was diffi-cult to dispose of you properly.
               
               As soon as they alighted, Mrs. Knight came to receive Henrietta, and presented her husband to her. Both seemed greatly charmed with her appearance, and politely thanked Mr. Cour-teney for bringing them so agreeable a guest.
               After a few compliments they withdrew, supposing the brother and sister would be glad of an opportunity to converse together in pri-vate. Mr. Courteney immediately drew his chair near his sister's, and, with a look of impatience, demanded the account she had promised him.
               
                  
Henrietta blushed, and begged him not to judge her errors too severely. She then gave him a candid relation of all that had happened to her, from her mother's death till the time she met him at the inn, concealing nothing from him but miss Belmour's passion for Mr. Campley.
               Mr. Courteney was variously affected during the course of her little story. He often changed countenance, but would not interrupt her. He observed with pleasure, that she laid no stress upon any part of her conduct, which might with justice challenge esteem and admiration, but appeared nicely conscious of every little im-prudence; and, when she had ended, waited for his reply, with an anxiety that shewed she rather expected censure than praise.
               "My dear Henrietta," said Mr. Courteney, at length, with tears in his eyes,
you have acted nobly; you cannot imagine how much your sufferings endear you to me, since you have behaved under them with such becoming fortitude.
               
               "How happy you make me," cried Henrietta,
by your approbationâ€” Indeed I wa
                        â€¢
                      afraid you would have chidden me sever

                     l
                        â€¢
                      for leaving my aunt in the manner I did.
               
               
                  
"It was a rash step," replied Mr. Courteney,
but your subsequent conduct has effaced it; and I see not how you could have otherwise avoided being in the power of that viliain-priest.
               
               After some farther conversation on different parts of her story, he looked at his watch: "how fast the minutes fly!" said he, smiling.
My dear Henrietta, I must leave you now, yet I have a thousand things to say to you; but I will see you to-morrow morning. You will be very happy (continued he) with Mrs. Knight, and I shall have no scruple to trust you to her care, till I have conducted the marquis to London: we shall go in a day or two; and, after I have delivered my charge safe to his father, I will come back to Paris, and fetch you.
               
               Henrietta turned pale at these words:
then we are to part again soon!
said she, in a melancholy accent.
               
                  It would be highly improper for you (re-plied he) to take this journey with us, on se-veral accounts: I shall be concerned to leave you, but it must be so.
               
               "Could you not stay till Mr. Bale comes?" interrupted Henrietta; and, taking his letter out 
                     â€¢
                  f her pocket,
see here how affectionately he

writes to me (added she) he proposes to be in Paris in three weeks, and insists upon my going to England with him.
               
               Mr. Courteney read the letter with great plea-sure. Mr. Bale addressed her in it by the tender name of daughter; and assured her, that he would in every respect act like a father towards her. He praised her conduct in terms of the highest admiration, and begged her not to be uneasy at her aunt's desertion of her; since it was in his power to make her easy, and he was resolved to do so.
               "This letter," said Mr. Courteney, after a pause,
will make some little alteration in my plan: I had resolved not to take any notice to the marquis, that I had discovered you to be my sister, but to make some excuse for your disappearing; however I see it will be necessary to wait for Mr. Bale. I congratulate you, my dear Henrietta, on the friendship o
                        â€¢
                      so worthy a man.
               
               "But will you stay till he comes to Paris?
                     â€¢
                   interrupted the tender, anxious Henrietta.
               "May I depend upon your prudence, sister?

                   said Mr. Courteney.

I took advantage of his youth to draw him into a marriage with my sister.
               
               "Oh! do not suspect me of such meanness," said Henrietta, blushing:
if the marquis was a thousand times more amiable than he is, and were I ever so much prejudiced in his favour, I have too just a sense of what I owe to my birth, to your honour, and my own, to admit of a clandestine addressâ€” You may be entirely easy upon this article.
               
               "I am satisfied," replied Mr. Courteney, tenderly pressing her hand;
and now, my dear Henrietta, adieu for this evening.
               
               "Don't fail to come to-morrow," said she, following him to the door. He smiled assent-ingly; and having taken leave of Mrs. Knight, who met him as he was going in search of her, he hurried home to his pupil, by whom he was expected with extreme impatience.

               THE marquis, as soon as he entered his chamber, perceived that something ex-traordinary had happened to him.
               
                  Sure (said he, smiling) you have met with some strange adventure, Freeman; you look pleased, and yet there is a thoughtful air in your countenance.

                   which could not be concealed from him)

                     
                        
                      have met with my sister here in Paris.

                      did not expect her, did you?
               
               "No, faith," replied Mr. Courteney;

she was very young when you parted, I ha

                      heard you say: I hope you will allow me 
                        
                      pay my respects to her; but (added he, i
                        â€¢
                      patiently) how does miss Belmour and 
                        
                      fair friend?
               
               
                  

                  Her fair friend, as you are pleased to call her (replied Mr. Courteney) is my sister, whom for so many weeks I have seen almost every day without knowing her.
               
               
                  Is it possible! (cried the marquis, surprised) miss Benson your sister! Sure you are not in earnest.
               
               
                  Indeed I am (said Mr. Courteney) I dis-covered her by the oddest accident: miss Bel-mour herself did not know who she was; but while I was there, she brought her a letter, which had been inclosed to her; it was di-rected for miss Courteney, and came from Mr. Bale, my sister's guardian: she owned the name, and by that means I found out my sister. I see you are astonished (added Mr. Courteney) poor Henrietta has told me all her story; the repetition would be tedious, butâ€”
               
               "How can you think so?" interrupted the marquis, eagerly:
can you doubt that I am extremely interested in every thing that con-cerns you.
               
               
                  Excuse me, my dear marquis (said Mr. Courteney) I really cannot enter into parti-culars just nowâ€” Fortune still persecutes my dear father in his children. I thought my sister was happily settled with her aunt lady

Meadows, who has no child, and adopted her; but the old lady, being a rigid Roman catholic, pressed her very much to change her religion, and was at last so strangely in-fluenced by an artful priest, who is her chap-lain, that she had formed a design to send my sister under the conduct of this fellow, to be shut up in a nunnery. The poor girl, who was, as I can collect by her account ex-tremely apprehensive of being so entirely in the power of this sly priest, had no way to avoid this misfortune, but by leaving her aunt privately, who absolutely refused to be recon-ciled to her on any other condition than her changing her religion. Thus deserted, her guardian being abroad, and having nothing to expect from her relations, she chose to go to service, and was recommended to miss Belmour by the countess of â€”, her kins-woman.
               
               "What a wretch must your uncle be!" said the marquis, with tears in his eyes,
to per-mit such excellenceâ€”
He stopped a mo-ment; then suddenly grasping his hand,
O
                        â€¢
                      my dear Freeman (pursued he) you have it in your power to make me happyâ€” You know how ardently I love your charming sisterâ€”
               
               
                  

there. He came several times, and was al-ways answered in the same manner. His enquiries at length reached the ears of my wife; she desired he might be shewn up to her apartment when he came next; and it was from him that she learned miss Courteney was under my care.
               
               
                  To one of her temper it was enough to know that I had the management of a lady's affairs, to make her suspect that I had a more than ordinary interest in the lady herself. But she concealed her thoughts from me: and I, who was wholly ignorant that this gentle-man had seen my wife, was only concerned at the connexion there seemed to be between miss Courteney and him; and therefore fixed upon that stratagem, to remove her out of his reach without giving her any suspicions of the cause.
               
               
                  I have since enquired about the gentleman; and I hear that he is a man of quality, and that he is shortly to be married to a great for-tune. Judge now whether his designs on miss Courteney could be honourableâ–ª and whether I had not reason to act as I did with regard to sending her away?
               
               
                  
"This I was apprehensive of," interrupted Mr. Courteney.
I beg, my lord, that you will banish these thoughts.
               
               "What!" cried the marquis, hastily;
have you any objection to my passion for your sister?
               
               "Indeed I have, and a very strong one," re-plied Mr. Courteney,
and that is the cer-tainty of the duke your father's disapprobation of it.
               
               "It is possible indeed," said the marquis, after a little pause,
that in the choice of a wife for me, my father will be influenced by the same motives that most fathers are: he will expect a large fortune with the person I marry; therefore, my dear Charles, you see the necessity there is for not consulting him in this case.
               
               "Sure you forget, my lord," interrupted Mr. Courteney, coolly,
what you once de-clared, that you would never enter into an engagement of this kind, contrary to the duke's inclinations.
               
               
                  I remember I said so (replied the mar-quis; and were I to make a choice which he could reasonably object to, certainly it would be wrong, very wrong to disobey him: but if the want of a fortune can make my father

disapprove of my affection for a young lady of miss Courteney's birth and merit, must I be governed by such sordid motives?
               
               The marquis went on to prove, by a great many arguments common enough on such oc-casions, that in the article of marriage, a parent had no right to lay any restraint upon the 
                     â€¢
                  uch nations of his child. Mr. Courteney did not think proper to enter into a dispute with him upon this subject: the patience with which he listened to him, made the young nobleman con-clude he was not unwilling to come into his measures.
               
                  My dear Charles (added he, after a short pause) will you not be my advocate with your charming sister? I die with impatience to throw myself at her feet, and offer her my heart and hand.
               
               
                  You cannot doubt, my lord (said Mr. Courteney) but that I think, my sister highly honoured by the esteem you express for her; but she would be very unworthy of it, if she was capable of admitting your addresses, ei-ther unknown to your father, or in opposi-tion to his will. I may venture to answer for her, that she will not, by so unjustifiable a con-duct, expose her brother to censure: and it gives me great concern to find you are no better

acquainted with my sentiments, than to ima-gine I will so basely betray the trust the duke has reposed in me, and be accessary to your disposing of yourself in a manner which I am very sure he will not approve.
               
               
                  Then I am to expect nothing from your friendship on this occasion, Mr. Courteney!
replied the marquis, with an air of displeasure:
you are determined to raise difficulties to my design, instead of removing them; is this act-ing like a man whom I have loved like a brother, and whom it would be my highest happiness to call so.
               
               
                  To call you brother with your father's con-sent, my lord (said Mr. Courteney) is an ho-nour I cannot hope for, and which without it I do not wish.
               
               
                  As noble and disinterested as you imagine this conduct to be (said the marquis, rising) it will have another name perhaps with per-sons less romantic in their notions than you are, However, sir, you are no more than the brother of miss Courteney; if I am happy enough to prevail with her to receive my ad-dresses, I shall not think your consent neces-sary.
He passed by him with a cool bow, as he pronounced these words, and retired to his own chamber.
            
            
               

               CHAP. VII.
               
                  In which we are afraid some of our readers will think Mr. Courteney acts a very silly part.
               
               MR. Courteney saw plainly, that by re-fusing to comply with his pupil's desires, he should entirely lose his friendship, but in a case where his honour was so greatly concerned, this consideration had no weight with him: and although he had a high opinion of his sister's candor and integrity, yet the intimation miss Belmour had given him of her regard for Mr. Melvil, made him apprehensive that she might be prevailed upon to listen to the vows of the marquis ofâ€”. He resolved therefore to keep the place of her abode a secret (for he knew he could depend upon the prudence of Mr. Knight and his wife) and to use his utmost endea-vours to hasten the young lord's departure from France.
               The marquis, mean time, was forming very different designs. It is so rare a thing for a man in love to be either reasonable or just, on occa-sions where the interest of his passion is con-cerned, that it is not surprising the marquis

should impute his governor's conduct with re-gard to his sister to peevishness and caprice, and think himself extremely ill used by his not accepting his offers. He conceived miss Cour-teney to be equally injured by the opposition her brother made to the advancement of her for-tune; and flattering himself that, if his person was not disagreeable to her, he should soon overcome any scruples Mr. Courteney might have suggested on account of the duke his fa-ther's disapprobation, he determined to consult him no further in the affair, but to address him-self directly to her.
               He spent part of the night in writing a letter to her, in which he declared his passion in the most tender and respectful terms, and begged she would allow him to wait upon her. The remaining hours were not spent in sleep, but in impatient longings for the morning, which was to confirm or destroy his hopes. As soon as it was light, he rose and walked about his room. He read over the letter he had written; he thought it but poorly expressed the ardor of his love: he sat down and wrote another, which he liked still less, and had recourse again to the first, after adding a postscript, in which he ear-nestly repeated his request to be indulged with a few moments private discourse with her.
               
                  
He sealed up his letter, and directed it for miss Courteney. Her brother had not men-tioned to him his having removed her from miss Belmour: he supposed she was still with her; but a doubt occurring to him, whether she was will-ing to assume her real name yet, he thought it best to put it in another cover, superscribed for miss Benson.
               It was still too early to send to a lady's lodg-ings; he counted the hours with anxious impa-tience, and at length rung his bell for his servant. As soon as he appeared, he gave him the letter, recommending secrecy, and charging him not to return without an answer.
               The valet, when he came back, brought him word that miss Benson was gone; and this was all the intelligence he could get. Miss Bel-mour's woman indeed had added with a sneer, that she went off with Mr. Freeman, and it was strange that his friend Mr. Melvil should not know where she was. This part of the mes-sage the fellow prudently suppressed; for he judged the business to be an amour, and that the young gentlemen were rivals, and he was afraid of making mischief.
               The marquis, however, easily guessed that this sudden removal of miss Courteney was her brother's act: he dismissed his servant; and

beginning now to be sensible how much it was in his governor's power to traverse his designs, and how obstinately he was bent upon doing so, he resigned himself up to the most violent trans-ports of rage; and, during a few moments, all his thoughts ran upon revenge.
               Mr. Courteney came into his chamber while he was under these agitations; and, seeing him walking about with a furious pace,
For Hea-ven's sake, my lord (said he) what is the matter with you?
               
               The marquis turned short upon him, and, with a voice broken with passion, exclaimed, "May I perish, Courteney, if I forgive you."
               Mr. Courteney, who supposed this resentment was the consequence of their conversation the night before, replied calmly,
You are angry, my lordâ€”This is no time to talk.
               
               He was going out of the room, but the mar-quis, hastily stepping between him and the door, shut it with great violence.
               "If it is not your time to talk, sir, it is mine," said he.
               "Very well, my lord," replied Mr. Court-ney, with a composed look and accent,
I am ready to hear you.
               
               The young nobleman continued to walk in a fullen silence, as if resolved to be angry, and

knew not well what cause to assign for it; when suddenly stopping,
               
                  I insist upon your telling me, sir (said he) why you have secreted your sister? Do you suspect I have dishonourable designs upon her?
               
               "Dishonourable designs upon my sister" repeated Mr. Courteney, kindling at the ex-pression:
my lord, no man, while I have life, shall incur such a suspicion with impu-nity.
               
               "This spirit becomes one of your birth," replied the marquis;
but let me tell you, Mr. Courteney, your conduct is not altogether consistent; why must your sister be hurried, no body knows whither, and concealed with such wonderful caution?
               
               "Are you sure this is the case, my lord?" said Mr. Courteney.
               "Yes, very sure," answered the marquis, hastily.
               
                  Since it was not I who gave your lordship this information,
resumed Mr. Courteney,
you must have taken some trouble to come to the knowledge of it; and the motive that set you upon these enquiries sufficiently justifies my caution with regard to my sister.
               
               
                  

                  Then I am not worthy, it seems, to pay my addresses so your sister,
said the marquis, peevishly.
               
                  Indeed, my lord, this is a very childish speech,
replied Mr. Courteney;
you know your addresses would do honour to any wo-man: but the depressed state of my sister's fortune leaves her no right to expect a man of your quality for a husband; and she has too just a pride to submit to make a clandestine marriage; nor will I be branded with the im-putation of having seduced my pupil into a marriage with my sister.
               
               "What have you to do with the affair at all?" replied the marquis, eagerly:
leave miss Cour-teney to act as she thinks proper; you need not make yourself answerable for my conduct on this occasion, I loved her before I knew her to be your sister; cannot your romantic honour satisfy itself with being passive in this business?
               
               
                  I should but ill perform my engagements to your father, my lord,
interrupted Mr. Courteney,
if I did not use my utmost endea-vours to prevent you from displeasing him in a matter of so great importance as your mar-riage.
               
               
                  

                  How are you sure my father will be dis-pleased?
said the marquis:
miss Courte-ney's merit will justify my choice.
               
               "Put it upon that issue," replied Mr. Cour-teney; "ask his consent."
               "Well, sir, I will ask his consent," resumed the marquis;
and now am I at liberty to visit your sister?
               
               
                  If you intend, my lord, to be governed by the duke's advice (said Mr. Courteney) you will certainly be contented to wait his answer; and you cannot suppose, that knowing your sentiments so well as I do, I will permit my sister to receive your visits while we are igno-rant of the duke's intentions.
               
               The marquis lost all patience at this unrea-sonable obstinacy, as he conceived it.
I re-nounce your friendship from this moment (said he) for ever; and, had you not a sister, I would resent this behaviour in ano-ther manner.
               
               He flung out of the room when he had said this; and, shutting himself up in his study, gave his valet orders to allow no body to disturb him.
               Mr. Courteney was not so much offended at the harshness of his language, as to hinder him from feeling great concern for the uneasy state
"And now, my dear," added Mrs. Willis, smiling,
did you ever hear a more plausible tale?
               
               "I have somewhere read it observed," re-plied Henrietta,
that we are better deceived by having some truth told us than none. Mr. Bale has put this maxim in practice; his tale is plausible, because part of it is true: but his inferences are all false; and their cause lies too deep for me to discover it.
               
               She then related succinctly all that had passed in the house of Mrs. Eccles, and that she had earnestly intreated Mr. Bale to dispose of her elsewhere, being resolved, after the affront that had been offered to her, to remain there no longer. She added, that the young lord hav-ing hinted his suspicions that Mr. Bale was her lover, she thought herself obliged to tell him his name, and explain the nature of his con-nexions with her, that she might not, by going away with a person unknown, leave room for calumny to slander her.
               Mrs. Willis was charmed with this candid account of her conduct, which overthrew all Mr. Bale's insinuations. She embraced her with great tenderness.
All will soon be set right (said she) your aunt will receive you

of his mind; and, notwithstanding his own temper was vehement enough, yet he was able to make some allowances for the transports of a young man, who saw himself so resolutely op-posed in a point he had set his heart upon: but despairing to pacify his pupil without entering into his design, he determined to place his sister effectually out of his reach, and then, if he could not prevail upon him to return to England, no-thing remained but to make the duke his father acquainted with the whole affair.
               He waited some time in expectation that the marquis would come down to breakfast as usual; but, finding that he had ordered his chocolate to be brought to him in his study, he went to visit his sister, as he had promised.
               The marquis heard him, as he passed by his door, call for his hat and sword; and, his valet entering a moment afterwards with the chocolate, he asked him, if Mr. Freeman was gone out? Being answered that he was, it suddenly came into his head, that he was going to see his sister.
               
                  Follow him instantly (said he to the fellow) and bring me word to what place he goes, and here is something to purchase your secrecy and diligence.
               
               
                  
The fight of two Louis d' ors, which the mar-quis gave him, left the valet no inclination to be discreet any longer. He ran out of the room with officious haste, fully determined to execute his commission with the utmost exactness. When he got into the street, he perceived Mr. Cour-teney walking leisurely on: he followed him at a distance, took particular notice of the house he entered; and, after waiting a few moments to see whether he came out again, he went back to the marquis with his intelligence.
               The young lover did not doubt but he had discovered his mistress's abode; and in the joy this thought gave him, he bestowed many praises on his valet's ingenuity, together with a reward of two Louis d' ors more, which he liked still better. He then ordered him to give directions for his chariot to be got ready, while he assisted him to dress. His looks discovered such an ex-cess of satisfaction, that the valet, under no ap-prehensions that what he had done would produce any disagreeable consequences, entered with vast delight upon his new post of confidant to his master. The marquis ordered him to stay at home till Mr. Freeman came in, and then imme-diately to come to him at the Hotel de â€”.
            
            
               

               CHAP. VIII.
               
                  In which Mr. Courteney gives more instances of his folly.
               
               WHILE Henrietta thus innocently sowed the seeds of discord between the two friends, she herself enjoyed a perfect compo-sure of mind, and indulged the most pleasing reflections on the happy change of her for-tune.
               She was no longer in the humiliating condi-tion of a servant; or, what to her was far more mortifying, a dependant upon the bounty of an-other; an unknown wanderer, without friends or protectors. She was now under the care of a brother, whom she tenderly loved, whose merit could not fail of distinguishing him, and of forcing that respect and consideration due to a noble birth, and which he, though in a deprest fortune, so nobly supported.
               She was assured that her guardian was not only free from any unfavourable prejudices on account of her aunt's desertion of her, but that she might expect all the tender offices of a parent from him; and, what afforded the nice sensibility of her soul a more delicate satisfaction than all this,

the only man in the world whom she was capa-ble of regarding, with a preference to the rest of his sex; though, in so elevated a rank, had loved her in indigence and obscurity with honour, and justified the tender sentiments she entertained for him.
               Her smiles, when she saw her brother appear, and the gaiety of her behaviour, convinced him, her mind was at ease; but his features still re-tained that impression of chagrin he had so lately felt from the marquis's causeless rage; and there was a solemnity in his manner, that, in an in-stant, changed the innocent chearfulness of Hen-rietta into anxiety and concern.
               The presence of Mrs. Knight was a restraint upon them both. She perceived it; and as soon as the tea-table was removed (for the ladies were at breakfast when Mr. Courteney came in) she retired and left them at liberty.
               The moment she was gone, Henrietta eagerly asked him, if any thing had happened to give him uneasiness since she saw him?
               
                  Yes (replied he abruptly) the marquis and I have quarrelled.
               
               "Quarrelled!" repeated Henrietta, trem-bling and pale as death,
have you qua-relled?
               
               
                  
Mr. Courteney, who observed her emotion, continued to look at her so earnestly that she blushed and cast down her eyes.
You seem greatly affected with this accident (said he at last) I wish I had not mentioned it to you.
               
               "Could you suppose," said Henrietta, in an accent which had at least as much of grief as tenderness in it,
that I could hear with indif-ference what must necessarily be very afflicting to you?
               
               
                  Your indifference perhaps, on this occa-sion (said Mr. Courteney) would be more welcome to me than the concern I see you under.
               
               Henrietta having pondered a little on the meaning of these words, replied in a firmer tone,
place some confidence in me, brother, you will find I shall deserve it.
               
               "My dear Henrietta," resumed Mr. Cour-teney, affected with the manner in which she spoke, and her expressive look,
you ought to forgive my doubts, when you reflect on what miss Belmour told me; the merit of my noble pupil has made an impression on your heart; but your marriage with him, sister, will bring everlasting infamy upon me.
               
               
                  Have I not already declared my resolution to you upon this head?
replied Henrietta.
               
                  
"The marquis loves you," resumed Mr. Cour-teney:
he is rash and inconsiderate; he has no hope (and indeed it would be strange if he had) that the duke his father will consent to such an unequal match; yet he presses me to introduce him to you as a lover, and to favour his designs of marrying you privately. You may easily imagine what answer I gave him; the consequence is, that he has de-clared himself my enemy. We are upon very bad terms. But this is not my greatest con-cern: the marquis, if he can get access to you, will teaze you with solicitations; and, disposed as you are in his favour, have I not cause to apprehend you will listen to him but too readily?
               
               "Although I should confirm your suspicions," said Henrietta, with tears in her eyes,
yet I must again repeat I am grieved at this differ-ence between your pupil and you. Nay I will own,
pursued she, avoiding with a sweet bashfulness the earnest looks of her brother,
that I am not insensible of this young noble-man's affection for me; but, after this candid confession, you ought to believe me, when I assure you, that I will enter into no engage-ment with him without your approbation and to make you easy, I will comply with

any measures you think proper, to avoid his pursuits.
               
               "I see I may rely upon you," said Mr. Cour-teney, charmed with her amiable frankness;
but, my dear Henrietta, I hope you will not allow this prepossession to take too deep root in your heart: sure your good sense, and the delicacy of your sentiments, will hinder you from giving way to a hopeless passion.
               
               "I beg you not to talk to me on this subject," interrupted Henrietta, tears, in spite of her en-deavours to restrain them, flowing fast down her face;
only tell me what you would have me do to avoid the marquis: have you formed any plan? Doubt not of my readiness to com-ply with it.
               
               
                  Have you any objections to boarding in a convent till Mr. Bale comes?
said Mr. Cour-teney.
               
                  No (replied Henrietta, half smiling) for I cannot suspect you have a design upon my re-ligion, as my aunt had, and mean to confine me all my life.
               
               "No, really," resumed Mr. Courteney, smiling likewise;
but it will be more difficult for the marquis to get access to you in a con-vent than here; and as it is probable enough that this affair will make some noise, it will

be more for your reputation to have it known that you lived in such a respectable society, where there were so many witnesses of your conduct, and such exact regularity required, than in private lodgings, where you were ac-countable to no body for your actions.
               
               
                  Then you intend to leave me before Mr. Bale comes?
said Henrietta, sighing.
               
                  To be sure (replied Mr. Courteney) I will force the marquis away if possible; and if I find all my remonstrances ineffectual, the duke must interpose his authority.
               
               "You intend to write to him then?" said Henrietta.
               
                  Certainly (replied he) don't you think I ought to do so, sister?
               
               "Indeed I do," answered she.
               
                  I am glad of it (resumed Mr. Courteney) yet this procedure will embroil me more with the marquis; but I see no help for it, unless Mr. Bale should happen to come sooner than we expect, and take you with him to England I hope to prevail upon my pupil to have Paris in two or three days; and if I have not the sa-tisfaction to leave you under Mr. Bale's care, convent is the fittest place for you to retire to.
               
               Henrietta, having reflected on her brother's proposal, found it so reasonable, and so much t

the advantage of her reputation, that she rea-dily yielded to put it in immediate execution.
               Mrs. Knight being desired to return, Mr. Courteney told her their design, and requested her assistance. She expressed some concern at being so soon to lose her agreeable guest, but undertook to transact: the affair; and it was re-solved that she should go that day, and procure the young lady to be admitted as a pensioner in the Augustine nunnery of English ladies in Paris.
               Mr. Courteney, having promised his sister to come and conduct her to the convent the next day, took leave of her, highly satisfied with her docility, and returned home. He was surprised to hear that the marquis was gone abroad; but having no suspicion of his intention to visit Hen-rietta, whose abode he concluded was still a se-cret to him, he was only concerned left his health should suffer, by venturing out before it was fully re-established.
               The marquis's valet no sooner saw Mr. Cour-teney return, than he ran immediately to ac-quaint his master, who set forwards, with a beating heart, to visit his mistress. The valet had given so exact a direction, that the coach-man had no difficulty to find the house. The marquis alighted the moment the door was opened, and asking the servant for miss Courte-ney,

was instantly introduced into a parlour, where Henrietta was sitting alone, Mrs. Knight having just left her to go and execute her com-mission.
               The sight of the marquis threw her into the utmost confusion. She rose, however, and re-ceived him with great respect: he approached her bowing, and made her a genteel compli-ment upon her happy meeting with her bro-ther.
               Henrietta would not suffer this subject to be dwelt upon long, left it should lead to circum-stances too interesting. She changed the con-versation to indifferent matters, and took care that it should not flag a moment; so that the marquis, partly embarrassed by that awe which always accompanies a sincere passion, and partly by the prudent management of Henrietta, found he had protracted his visit to a considerable length, without drawing any advantage from it.
               Alarmed at the thoughts of losing an opportu-nity, which the rigid and inflexible temper of his governor might prevent him from meeting with again, he suddenly assumed courage

with redoubled affection.
Miss Courteney sighed; but having already taken her resolution, she was prepared for whatever events might happen.

                  Which we are afraid will give some of our readers a mean opinion of our heroine's under-standing.
               
               TWO days afterwards a letter was brought by the post for miss Courteney; the direc-tion was in her aunt's hand: she opened it with some trepidation, and found it as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        HENRIETTA,
                     
                     FOR niece I cannot, after what has hap-pened, call youâ€” If you had not, by the highest imprudence that any young woman could be guilty of, given too much

                        our for the shocking censures that are cast on you, I might perhaps have been deceived by your plausible account of things. I am sorry to find you have acquired so much art, it is but too sure a proof that you are less innocent;

fortune, to use towards a young lady in her deli-cate circumstances, whom he would not for a moment leave in doubt of the sincerity of his professions, and his firm resolution to adhere to them.
               Henrietta listened to him with a graceful mo-desty; and when he earnestly pressed for her an-swer, she assured him, that she was very sen-sible of the honour he did her, and should always think herself obliged to him for having enter-tained such favourable sentiments of her, as could make him overlook the inequality there was be-tween them. As for the rest, she referred him to her brother, who, she said, was in the place of a father to her, and by whose advice and di-rection she was determined to be governed en-tirely.
               The marquis would have had no reason to be dissatisfied with this answer, if he had not known that he had nothing to expect from an applica-tion to her brother, and the apprehension that she also knew it, and therefore took this me-thod to free herself from his importunities, gave him so much concern, that he turned pale, and sighing, fixed his eyes upon the ground. His air, his attitude, his looks, were all so mov-ing, so expressive of tenderness, anxiety, and grief, that Henrietta durst not trust herself to

behold him, lest he should turn his eyes towards her, and discover in her's the too great interest she took in his uneasiness.
               Some moments passed in an affecting silence on both sides, during which the marquis re-mained immoveably fixed in the same pensive posture, till rouzed by the opening of the door, and the appearance of Mr. Courteney. Hen-rietta's face was in an instant covered with blushes: the marquis seemed greatly embar-rassed. Mr. Courteney shewed some surprise at first; but, recovering himself, he spoke to his pupil with an easy air, and relieved both him and his sister from their confusion, by enter-ing immediately into an indifferent conversa-tion.
               The marquis drew a favourable omen from this behaviour: his looks resumed their usual sweetness and vivacity; and, during a who

               The marquis at length, with apparent relu

                  tance, put an end to his visit, as did Mr. Cour-teney likewise, though he was

talking to his sister in private. When they were in the chariot together, the young lord was se-veral times upon the point of pressing his go-vernor again upon the subject of his love, as he seemed to be less inclined than formerly to op-pose him; but he was restrained from entering into any explanation, by his apprehension of de-stroying those hopes he had so lately began to en-tertain, and of rendering his access to Hen-rietta more difficult for the future: Mr. Cour-teney also had his reasons for preventing any such explanation, and industriously amused him with other discourse.
               The marquis could not help thinking it strange that he took no notice of the visit he had made his sister: but as love is ever ready to flatter its own wishes, he began to imagine that Mr. Courteney had relaxed in the severity of his re-solutions, but knew not yet how to yield with a good grace; he favoured his embarrassment therefore for the present, and they passed the re-maining part of the day in their usual company and diversions.
               When they came home at night, the marquis desired to have an hour's conversation with him; but Mr. Courteney, complaining of a sudden head-ach, excused himself, and retired to his own chamber.
               
                  
The next morning, before his pupil was up, he repaired to Mrs. Knight's. She told him, that every thing was agreed on for the reception of the young lady; and he had the satisfaction to find his sister making preparations for her re-moval, without any appearance of discontent. She acquainted him with what had passed in the conversation between the marquis and her.
               "I have no doubt of his affection for you," said Mr. Courteney;
we must leave the event of it to Providence, and act so as that what-ever happens, we may not incur censure.
               
               As soon as breakfast was over, Henrietta, ac-companied by Mrs. Knight and her brother, went in a coach to the convent, where she was very civilly received by the prioress. Mr. Courteney promised to visit her soon, and took leave of her, to wait upon Mrs. Knight home; after which he returned to the marquis, who had enquired for him several times.
            
            
               

               CHAP. IX.
               
                  In which the reader, it is presumed, can make no dis-coveries concerning the event of this history.
               
               THE marquis, when he saw him enter his chamber, approached him with an obliging air, and affectionately pressing his hand,
               
                  May I hope, my dear Courteney (said he) that you have overcome your fantastic scruples, and that you will favour my pretensions to your charming sister. I will make you no apology for stealing a visit to her; you would, I am sure, have done the same in my situation. In-deed, Charles, you must either resolve to give me miss Courteney, or to see me miserable. She referred me to you; my happiness de-pends upon a single word of your's: can you be so cruel to refuse me this instance of your friendship?
               
               "You know, my lord," replied Mr. Cour-teney,
that there is not any thing you can desire of me, consistent with my honour, which I would refuse; but, unless I would make my-self infamous, I cannot yield to your marry-ing my sister without the duke's consent.

Hear what I have to propose,
continued he, perceiving him to be in a violent emotion;
let us return to England immediately. You have often told me, that the duke is a most tender father; you are an only child: it is possible he may be prevailed upon to yield to your de-sires, if you tell him you cannot be happy without my sister. Let us make the trial at least.
               
               "I agree to it," interrupted the marquis, eagerly,
provided you will promise me, that if my father is so unreasonable as to refuse his consent, you will no longer oppose my mar-riage. I am of age; it is fit, that in a matter of such importance to the future happiness of my whole life, I should be at liberty to follow my inclinations. Speak, Charles, will you make me this promise?
               
               "Indeed, I will not, my lord," replied Mr. Courteney, "you must not expect it."
               "Detested obstinacy!" cried the marquis, flinging his hand away, which he had held till this moment,
what a wretch am I to have my happiness depend upon the will of a capricious man, who mikakes his romantic whims for honour! But observe what I say, Courteney,
added he, turning hastily towards him,
you shall not hinder me from visiting your sister,

nothing but her absolute commands shall pre-vent my seeing her.
               
               
                  My sister (said Mr. Courteney) will stay no longer in France, than till Mr. Bale (to whose care her mother left her at her death) returns from Montpelier: he is to conduct her to England; and she is gone to board in a convent till his arrival.
               
               "Gone to a convent!" repeated the marquis; "this is your scheme, I suppose."
               "I hoped to prevail upon you," said Mr. Courteney,
since you are quite recovered, to leave Paris immediately; and I thought a convent the properest place for my sister to re-side in till her guardian comes.
               
               The marquis instantly running over in his thoughts the use that might be made of this in-telligence, replied, that he had no inclination to leave Paris yet; and broke off all farther conversation by quitting the room.
               In effect, he had resolved to make an applica-tion to Mr. Bale, supposing, that since he had not the same foundation for scruples as his go-vernor, he would readily listen to an offer so ad-vantageous for his ward.
               Mr. Courteney penetrated into his views, and doubtful how Mr. Bale would act, and whether his sister, having the sanction of his approba-tion,

might not give way to the motions of he
                     â€¢
                   own heart, and encourage the addresses of the marquis; he concluded it necessary to make the duke acquainted with the whole affair, that 
                     
                   might take such measures as he judged proper 
                     
                   restrain his son from an action which might in
                     â€¢
                   his displeasure.
               He wrote accordingly that day, and having thus discharged his duty, his mind was more at case.
               The marquis, full of hope that his new scheme would be successful, made no effort to see Henrietta, for fear of raising suspicions in her brother: but the coldness and reserve with which he treated him, sufficiently shewed how much he resented his conduct.
               Henrietta was soon reconciled to a retire-ment, in which she had full liberty to indulge her reflections; for she was in love enough to find more satisfaction in being alone, than in the gayest and most agreeable society. Her bro-ther did not fail to visit her every day: he found her satisfied with her situation; and, in appear-ance, no otherwise affected with his approach-ing departure, which he gave her room to expect, than what her tenderness for him might well allow of.
               
                  
In the mean time the duke ofâ€”, hav-ing received Mr. Courteney's letter, was greatly pleased with the nobleness and generosity of his behaviour. He wrote to him immediately, in terms of the highest friendship and regard; and, acquainting him with the purport of his letter to his son, recommended it to him to hasten his de-parture, assuring him, he had the firmest reliance upon his integrity and honour.
               The packet, to avoid suspicion, had been di-rected as usual to the marquis, who was not surprised to find a letter in it for Mr. Cour-teney, to whom his father was accustomed to write often: he sent it to him immediately; and, after reading his own, he went to Mr. Courteney's chamber, holding it still in his hand.
               
                  My father writes to me (said he) to leave Paris as soon as possible. He does not ex-presly say that he is ill; but, from some hints in his letter, I can collect that this is the cause of his extreme earnestness to see me. You cannot imagine how much I am affected with this accident (pursued he, sighing). I love my father: I did not know how much I loved him, till I feared his loss. I am determined to set out to-morrow from Paris; but I must see your sister first, Courteney, nor ought you

to refuse me the satisfaction of telling her, that I depart with a firm resolution never to be but her's.
               
               "Well, my lord," replied Mr. Courteney, after a little pause,
we will go together, and take leave of my sister.
               
               
                  I was to blame (said the marquis) to expect any indulgence from you: we will go toge-ther then, since it must be so.
He retired again to his own apartment to write to his fa-ther; and in the mean time Mr. Courteney gave the necessary orders for their journey the next morning.
               Henrietta had been prepared by a billet from her brother, for the visit that was intended her. The news of their departure had cost her some tears; but when she was informed they waited for her in the parlour of the convent, she ap-peared before them with all that soft composure and dignity of manners, which never forsook her in the most trying situations.
               Mr. Courteney watched the turn of his countenance when the marquis accosted her, and was pleased to see it equally free from embarrassment and affectation; and that, not-withstanding all the expressive language of her lover's eyes, she had so much command over

yet it would be easy for me to take to pieces every part of your defence, and shew you the absurdity of it: but this is needless; for, whe-ther you are innocent or guilty, you have greatly wounded your reputation, and I can no longer with honour consider you or treat you as my niece.
                     There is but one way left by which you can retrieve your fame and my affection; motives which ought to have some weight with you, but infinitely less than the desire of securing your salvation.
                     I hoped and believed your conversion was near completed, and doubtless it would have been, had not your passions intervened.
                     If you will retire to a convent, and put yourself into a way of being instructed in the true religion, I will pay your pension largely; and the day that sees you reunited to the faith, shall see you restored to my fondest affec-tion, and made sole heiress to my whole estate. Consider well before you determine; and know, that upon any other terms than these, you must not hope for farther notice from me.
                     
                        F. MEADOWS.
                     
                  
               
               
                  

herself, as to seem the least interested person in company.
               Politeness obliged the marquis to shorten his visit, that the brother and sister might be at li-berty to take a private leave of each other. He rose from his seat, and approached Henrietta, with an air that left her no room to doubt of his intention to say something particular to her; and now, for the first time, her looks betrayed some little confusion.
               
                  I cannot go away, madam (said he) with-out renewing the declaration I made you some days ago; and I take this opportunity to assure you, before your brother, who knows the sincerity of my heart, that my sentiments for you will ever be the same: and, if you do not forbid it, I will carry away with me the dear hope of being able one day to merit your esteem.
               
               Henrietta courtefied in silence; but her blushes, and the soft confusion she was in, seemed no un-favourable omen for the marquis: he bowed re-spectfully, and retired.
               Mr. Courteney, affecting not to perceive his sister's concern, entered immediately after his pupil's departure into other discourse. He re-commended it to her to improve her guardian's esteem for her, and assured her he would visit

lady Meadows, and use his utmost endeavours to remove her prejudices, and restore her to the place she formerly held in her affection: at her desire likewise he promised to call upon Mrs. Willis, to whom she had been so greatly obliged. He charged her to keep up no sort of intimacy with miss Belmour, though she should seek it, but permitted her, in company with Mr. Bale, to pay her a farewel visit; and, indeed, the conduct of that young lady, since the arrival of Mr. Campley, justified these pre-cautions.
               Henrietta promised to follow all his directions. He said a thousand affectionate things to her; and then, desiring to see the prioress, he ten-derly recommended his sister to her care, took a short leave, and went home; while Henrietta retired to her chamber to weep.
               The marquis was not visible till the next morning, when he was informed that the post-chaise was at the door. His extreme melan-choly during the whole journey, gave his go-vernor great concern: but he in vain attempted to amuse him; for though the marquis behaved to him with all imaginable respect, yet he was so cold and reserved, that he found it impossible to renew his former freedom with him.
               
                  
The duke of â€” had informed them, that he should be at his country-seat; and, imme-diately upon their landing in England, they re-paired thither: the duke received his son with the most tender transports, and his governor with every mark of esteem and regard.
               The morning after their arrival, he sent for Mr. Courteney into his closet, and thanked him in very affectionate terms for having so faith-fully and honourably discharged his trust. He politely avoided mentioning the affair of the young lord's passion for his sister, because she was his sister; but said enough to convince him, that he had the most grateful sense of his disin-terested conduct upon that occasion. He settled on him, during his life, the sum he had allowed him while he travelled with the marquis; and offered him, in the most cordial manner, all his interest towards procuring him an establishment suitable to his birth.
               Mr. Courteney received these instances of the duke's friendship for him with respect and gratitude; but he was more touched with the old nobleman's delicacy with regard to his sister, than with all the favours conferred on himself.
               The interest of this sister, whom he loved with the most tender affection, made him has-ten

his departure from the duke's seat, that he might wait on his aunt, who he had heard was in London. The duke embraced him tenderly at parting, and obliged him to promise that he would return as soon as possible. The marquis lost all his reserve and coldness, when he took leave of his governor, his friend, and, what was more than all, the brother of his adored Henrietta.
               "You have used me unkindly," said he, in a low voice; yet pressing him tenderly to his breast, "but I shall always love you."
               Mr. Courteney let fall some tears, but made no answer; and immediately after mounting his horse, he set out for London, attended by his own servant, and one of the duke's, whom his grace had ordered to escort him.
            
            
               

               CHAP. X.
               
                  Which leaves the reader still in doubt.
               
               MR. Courteney, when he came within a short distance of London, dismissed the duke's servant, with compliments to his grace and the marquis, and proceeded 
                     
                   his journey. It came into his head to alight 
                     
                   the house of Mrs. Willis, from whom it was possible he might receive some intelligence that would be of use to him. The good woman received him with great civility; but, when he told her his name, she was in transports, and enquired for her be-loved miss Courteney with the tender anxiety of a mother.
               Mr. Courteney told her, that his sister would soon be in London with her guardian. He took occasion to thank her for her friendly care of her, which Henrietta had mentioned with the utmost gratitude; and assured her, he should always con-sider himself as highly obliged to her.
               
                  How largely do I share in my dear miss Courteney's joy (said she) for so happy a meeting with her beloved brother! Heaven will, I doubt not, shower its blessings on her;

for sure if ever mortal deserved them she does, O! sir, your sister is an angelic creatureâ€”
               
               Mrs. Willis, indulging the tender effusions of her heart, continued to expatiate on Henrietta's virtues, till Mr. Courteney, though not dis-pleased to hear her, interrupted her, to ask some questions concerning his aunt.
               
                  I was going to write to miss Courteney to-day, sir (replied she) for I have great news to acquaint her with: that vile priest, who was the cause of all her uneasiness, has at length shewn himself in his true colours. The sanc-tified hypocrite was detected in an amour with lady Meadows's woman: this affair has opened her eyes; she thinks her niece has been greatly injured by the misrepresentations of this wretch, whom she has discarded with infamy; and the first proof she has given of her favourable dis-position towards miss Courteney, was her taking again her former woman, whom she had dismissed on account of her attachment to the young lady. I had this intelligence 
                        
                      Mrs. White herself; for so your aunt wo-man, sir, is called. She says she does not doubt but her lady will write to miss Courte-ney in the most tender manner, and invite her home again.
               
               
                  
This news gave Mr. Courteney great satisfac-tion: he resolved not to delay a moment visiting his aunt; his portmantua had been carried into a chamber, by Mrs. Willis's directions, and thi-ther he retired to dress. As soon as he was ready, he got into a hackney-coach, and fraught with a thousand kind wishes from this faithful friend of his sister, he proceeded to the house of lady Meadows.
               He was so lucky as to find her at home, and sent in his name without any hesitation. The old lady, in a violent flutter of spirits, advanced as far as the door of her apartment to meet her nephew. His graceful form and polite address prejudiced her instantly in his favour; and she re-ceived him with all the tenderness he could have wished, and with much more than he expected.
               Her first enquiries were for Henrietta. Mr. Courteney was pleased with this solicitude; but he observed that, during the course of their con-versation, her attention with regard to his sister, decreased considerably. He praised her with all the modesty, yet with all the affection of a bro-ther.
               Lady Meadows, who had heard a very advan-tageous account of her niece from the countess, her good friend, assured him that she knew his sister's merit, and had restored her to that ten-derness

and esteem, which some little errors of her's, and some unjust suspicions of her own, which had been artfully infused into her, had robbed her of. She expressed great satisfaction at hearing of her guardian's kindness: but her words, "I hope he will do something for her." gave Mr. Courteney great concern; who, from the first moment that he had heard Henrietta was likely to recover her favour, had formed a scheme to make her and the marquis happy.
               Lady Meadows perceived that he was af-fected with that expression: she therefore added that his sister might depend upon a welcome re-ception from her, whenever she returned to England.
               Though there was nothing to object to the words of this declaration, yet there was a great deal to the manner of it. In the coldness with which she made it, he saw the disappointment of his hopes. In reality, lady Meadows had begun to entertain a prodigious fondness for her nephew; and Henrietta had now but the second place in her affection. The longer she con-versed with him, the more this fondness in-creased. Women are ever readier to discover merit in the other sex than their own. Hen-rietta had as many amiable qualities as her bro-ther; but lady Meadows was not so sensible of

them: and Mr, Courteney made as great a progress in her affections in three hours, as his sister had done in as many months.
               When he rose up to take his leave, she de-clared, with some vehemence, that he must have no other home than her house.
You have an aunt (added she, smiling) tho' you have no uncle, nor any other relations.
Mr. Courteney reddened with indignation at the mention of his unworthy uncle; but, recovering himself, he made her suitable acknowledgments for her kindness, and, at her desire, imme-diately dispatched a messenger to Mrs. Willis, to acquaint her that he should not return, and at the same time sent orders to his servant to bring his portmantua.
               Lady Meadows having given directions for an apartment to be prepared for Mr. Courteney, they passed the evening together with great sa-tisfaction, particularly on the part of the old lady, who thought herself extremely happy in having so accomplished a youth for her nephew. All her thoughts ran upon the pleasure she should have in shewing him to her friends and acquaint-ance, and of piquing his unnatural uncle, by openly professing her regard for him.
               More than a week after his arrival was spent in a continual succession of visits, to all which

he attended her; and so absolutely had he won her heart in that time, that she determined on nothing less than the making him her sole heir. Mr. Courteney, who was desirous of improving the favour he was in to his sister's advantage, took all opportunities to revive his aunt's affec-tion for her; so that to please him, she ex-pressed an impatience to see her. He received letters from her, and from the duke of â€”, the same day. Henrietta informed him, that she had heard from Mr. Bale, and that she ex-pected him in Paris in a few days: that the af-fairs he had to settle there, would detain him but a short time; after which they were to set out immediately for England. She added, that the marquis had wrote to her, and gave him a brief recapitulation of his letter, which seemed to be dictated by the most ardent affection, and the strictest principles of honour.
               The duke's letter contained only an earnest request to see him as soon as possible. Lady Meadows was very unwilling to part with him, though he assured her, he would return in two or three days. He spent part of the night in answering his sister's letter, and set out the next morning in a post-chaise for the duke'
                     â€¢
                   seat: he reached it in the evening at support time.
               
                  
Although several parts of this letter were ex-tremely shocking both to the delicacy and pride of Henrietta, yet the shining bribe that was of-fered her to procure her apostasy, made a large compensation. She had now an opportunity given her of making a worthy sacrifice to the religion she believed and professed; a circum-stance that exalted her in her own opinion: for her self-love had been deeply wounded by the humiliations she had undergone; and as great delicacy always suffers most, so it enjoys most from its own reflection.
               She was not free from a little enthusiasm that told her it was glorious to suffer in the cause of religion, nor so disinterested as not to feel great pleasure in the thought of being able to free her moral character from injurious suspicions, by so firm an attachment to her religious prin-ciples.
               Her impatience to answer her aunt's letter would not allow her time to communicate to Mrs. Willis the contents of it: but as soon a

He found only the duke and his son at table; in the countenance of the latter, he observed a profound melancholy, which sen-sibly affected him. The duke received him with great kindness. The marquis spoke little, but seemed pleased to see him. The next morn-ing the duke sent for Mr. Courteney into his closet.
               "What shall I do with my son?" said he to him abruptly, as soon as he entered,
you see the way he is in; he will certainly break my heart. I made him a very advantageous proposal three days ago: he tells me posi-tively his heart is engaged; yet he knows I am very desirous the match I mentioned to him should take place. This is such an in-stance of obstinacy and disobedience, as I know not how to pardon. Little did I ima-gine that his return, which I so passionately wished for, would be productive of so much uneasiness to me.
               
               The duke paused here, and looked earnestly at Mr. Courteney, who, not knowing what it was he expected from him, or to what aim his words were directed, continued silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
               
                  
"I see you are concerned," resumed the duke,
for the trouble this unlucky affair gives me.
               
               "Indeed I am, my lord, most sincerely," replied Mr. Courteney.
               
                  Then I may depend upon your readiness to assist me in removing it (said his grace) hear what I have to proposeâ€”Your sister, allowing for the warmth of an admirer's imagination, appears to me, by my son's 
                        â€¢â€¢
                     
                     -count of her, to have a great deal of merit: such a young lady cannot be without pre-tenders to her heart. It would give me great pleasure to contribute to her establish-ment: if you have a match in view for her, let me know if I can forward it, either by my purse or my interest. I candidly confess to you, that meer generosity is not my mo-tive for making you this offer: my son's passion is strengthened by hope; when your sister is married, I may find it less difficult to prevail upon him to yield me the obedi-ence I require, and which I have a right to expect.â€”You do not answer me, Mr. Cour-teney,
added his grace, after a little pause,
is there any thing disagreeable in this pro-posal?
               
               
                  
"Thus pressed, my lord," replied Mr. Cour-teney,
it becomes me to speak with plain-ness and sincerityâ€” I have no power over my sister's inclinations, and no consideration whatever should oblige me to hurry her into a marriage, which her own choice did not direct her to. Besides, I am not without suspicions, that the merit of the marquis has made some impression on her heart; and, though she has sacrificed it to her honour and duty, yet it will for some time, no doubt, render her deaf to any offer that could be made her. I am very certain, my lord, that she will never encourage the addresses of the marquis without your grace's consent; but were she capable of acting differently from my hopes and expectations, my honour is concerned to prevent it: and I most solemnly assure your grace, that my sister shall never be the wife of the marquis without your ex-press approbation.
               
               The duke could not help being pleased with the candor and spirit of this reply.
We must leave this affair then as we found it,
said he:
I am so well convinced of your in-tegrity and honour, that I rely upon you en-tirely to prevent any consequences that may be disagreeable to me.
               
               
                  
The duke that moment perceiving his son crossing the terrace opposite to his window, desired Mr. Courteney to join him.
You have still great influence over the marquis, (said he) try what your persuasions can do to make him alter his behaviour; this obstinacy of his both afflicts and offends me.
               
               Mr. Courteney bowed, and quitted the duke's closet immediately. The marquis, when he saw him coming towards him, stopped to wait for him.
               "You have been closeted with my father," said he to him, smiling,
may I know the sub-ject of your conversation?
               
               "I dare engage your lordship guesses," re-plied Mr. Courteney, smiling likewise.
               
                  I believe I do (said the marquis) the duke has been complaining of me for my disobe-dience, has he not?
               
               
                  His grace tells me he has made you a proposal, my lord, which you have rejected (answered Mr. Courteney) and he is under great concern about it.
               
               "Well, I am sorry for his uneasines
                     â€¢
                  ," in-terrupted the marquis:
but there 
                        
                      help for it.
               
               
                  

                  Ah, my lord (said Mr. Courteney) have I not cause to be very uneasy also? I who know your motive for disobliging the duke, in a point he seems to have so much at heart?
               
               "You are mistaken," resumed the marquis,
I should act as I do, tho' I had never seen miss Courteney. But tell me, my dear Charles, have you heard from your sister?
               
               "I have, my lord," replied he.
               "She is well, I hope," resumed the mar-quis, sighing.
               "She says nothing to the contrary," answered Mr. Courteney;
but I find your lordship has wrote to her.
               
               "Then she mentions me in her letter?" cried the marquis, eagerly:
I did indeed write to her, but she would not favour me with an answer. But, dear Charles (conti-nued he) have you not miss Courteney's letter about you? let me see that part where I am mentioned. Shew me only my name, written by her dear hand, you know not what plea-sure it will give me to see it.
               
               
                  Upon my honour I have not her letter here,
said Mr. Courteney.
Why, why, my lord,
pursued he, in great concern,
will you indulge this fatal passion for my sister?

you must by this time be convinced that it can produce nothing but uneasiness to the duke, yourself, to me, and even to her.
               
               "To her!" repeated the marquis.
O! Charles, your sister is wrapped up in indiffer-ence and reserve; she has not the least sensi-bility for what I suffer upon her account.
               
               
                  You are too generous, my lord (replied Mr. Courteney) to wish my sister should en-courage any sentiments for you but those of respect and esteem. It would be presump-tion in her to hope for the duke's approba-tion of your passion; and were she too sen-sible of it, she must be unhappy.
               
               "It is enough for me to be unhappy," re-sumed the marquis, sighing;
unhappy in the avarice of my father, to whom I have laid open my whole heart. The want of a for-tune is all the objection he has to miss Cour-teney; for he appeared charmed with her character, and her birth he knows. Unhappy too, in a rigid friend, who sacrifices me to the fantastic notions he has formed of honour. O! Charles, little did I imagine once that you would have contributed all in your power to make me miserable.
               
               
                  

                  Indeed, my lord (replied Mr. Courteney) this reflection is cruel: this very moment all my thoughts are employed on the means to make you happy.
               
               "Now you are again my friend," interrupted the marquis, embracing him eagerly:
will you then at last give me your charming sister. All that duty can require I have performed: I have implored my father's consent; he has had the cruelty to refuse it me; and this on a motive so sordid, that I am justifiable in fol-lowing my inclinations without soliciting him any more.
               
               "You mistake my intentions, my lord," in-terrupted Mr. Courteney:
no, never expect that I will consent to your marrying my sister without the duke's approbation.
               
               
                  What then did you mean (said the marquis) by the hopes you gave me just now?
               
               
                  To prevail, if possible, upon the duke to consent to your marriage,
replied Mr. Cour-teney.
               The marquis sighed, and cast down his eyes, as if hopeless that this expedient would succeed: but would not say any thing to divert him from his purpose: yet he thought it strange that he should undertake a task, which, interested as he

was, seemed less proper for him than any other person.
               Mr.Courteney guessed his thoughts, but would not explain himself any farther. In reality, what the marquis had said of his father's having no other objection to his choice but the want of a fortune, confirmed him in his design of using the favour he was in with lady Meadows to the advantage of his sister; and he was not without expectations of prevailing upon her, by the pros-pect of so honourable a match for her niece, to do as much for her as she had formerly pro-mised, in case she had married the old ba-ronet.
               The marquis, who beheld him earnestly, perceived something was labouring in his mind, and he began to entertain hopes of success, tho' he knew not on what reasonably to found them. "I cannot," said Mr. Courteney, observing the tender solicitude with which he gazed on him,
communicate to you the scheme I have formed to reconcile the duke to your wishes, for reasons which will be obvious enough here-after. Only thus much I will say to satisfy you, that I think it is highly probable I shall succeed; but there is one condition which you must yield to, and which I tell you

plainly is the price I set upon my endeavours to serve you in this affair.
               
               "Name it," interrupted the marquis, eagerly,
it must be a strange one indeed if I do not comply with it.
               
               
                  You must give me a solemn promise, my lord (resumed Mr. Courteney) not to seek my sister's consent to a clandestine marriage, if I should fail in my endeavours to procure the duke's approbation, and you must make the same promise to his grace likewise.â€” Nay, my lord,
pursued he, observing that he hesitated,
you risk nothing by entering into this engagement, for I am bound by oath, as well as by honour, to prevent my sister from being your's upon any terms but the duke's express consent; and, depend upon it, you will never gain her's but on the same condition.
               
               
                  Well (replied the marquis) you have my promise, and I will make the same declara-tion to my father: it will be time enough to tell him, if your scheme proves unsuccessful, my fixed resolution never to marry at all, if I do not marry miss Courteney.
               
               Mr. Courteney had already gained so impor-tant a point, that he did not think it necessary to combat this resolution at that time. They

walked together into the house; and the mar-quis conceiving that it might be of some advan-tage to Mr. Courteney's scheme to take an early opportunity of making the promise he required of him, the duke had that satisfaction in his next private conversation with his son, and was charmed with this new instance of Mr. Courte-ney's integrity.
               The marquis, after having long puzzled him-self with conjectures about the design Mr. Cour-teney had formed, at length concluded that he had some expectations from the earl of â€”, his uncle, in favour of his sister; and he was so unfortunately circumstanced between his father's avarice and Mr. Courteney's strict principles of honour, that he was reduced to wish earnestly for the success of an expedient, which he would have disdained, if he had been master of his own actions. Mr. Courteney at parting, which was in a few days, begged him to rely securely upon his friendship, and to be mindful of the promise he had given him, which the young lord again confirmed.

it down, and, in a melancholy accent, and a look that expressed the most anxious curiosity, asked her how she had resolved?
               "Read this," said Henrietta, giving her the letter she had written; I am sure you will not "disapprove of what I have done." Mrs. Willis read it eagerly, and found it as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        MADAM,
                     
                     IT is a great grief to me to find that your affection is irrecoverable, for at the price you have set upon it, I must ever deem it so. If my defence seems absurd, madam, it is be-cause truth is too weak to combat prejudice: I leave it to time and my future conduct to clear my innocence, and am resolved never to give a confirmation to those aspersions which are cast on my character, by sacrificing my religion to my interest.
                     That poverty, which happily is become my choice, will be my best vindication; and if it affords me no other blessing but that of a good conscience, it will bestow on me the highest that is attainable in this life, and which will enable me to bear chearfully all the mis-fortunes that may befal me; among which I shall always look upon the loss of your esteem

               CHAP. XI.
               
                  In which the history draws near to a conclusion.
               
               MR. Courteney found his short absence had rather endeared him to his aunt, than lessened the ardor of her fondness; encouraged by her behaviour, he was several times upon the point of laying open to her the whole affair of his pupil's passion for Henrietta, and the dif-ficulties which obstructed so advantageous a match; difficulties which she could so easily re-move: but he hoped a great deal from the presence of Henrietta, which it was highly pro-bable would revive the old lady's tenderness for her, and from the interposition of Mr. Bale, who, it was not to be doubted, would enter heartily into the interest of his ward, for whom he expressed so tender an affection.
               While he waited in anxious expectation of a letter from his sister, to acquaint him when she was to leave Paris, with her guardian, he was pleasingly surprised with a billet from Mr. Bale himself, requesting him to meet miss Cour-teney and him at the house of Mrs. Willis, where they were just arrived.
               
                  
Mr. Courteney, without communicating this news to lady Meadows, hastened to see his be-loved sister. The moment he entered the room, where she was sitting with her guardian and Mrs. Willis, she flew to receive him with a transport of joy. He embraced her tenderly; and Mr. Bale advancing to salute him, he in the politest manner, thanked him for his generous care of Henrietta.
               Mr. Bale was extremely pleased to hear that she might depend upon an affectionate recep-tion from her aunt. "And now, my child," said he; for so he tenderly affected to call her,
since I have delivered you safe into the handâ–ª of your brother, I will leave you, and a day or two hence I will visit you at your aunt's, and settle your affairs in a manner which I hope will not be disagreeable to you.
               
               Henrietta, who, from some past conversa-tions with him, well knew the kind purport of these words, by a grateful look and a respectful courtesy, expressed her acknowledgment. Mr. Courteney, seeing him prepare to leave them, begged he would favour him with a few mo-ments private conversation. Mr. Bale readily consented; upon which Mrs. Willis shewed them into another room, and returned to load

her dear miss Courteney with a thousand tender caresses.
               Mean time Mr. Courteney gave the friendly guardian of his sister a brief account of the mar-quis's passion for her, and the conduct he had observed in that affair. He added, that he be-lieved it would be easy to engage the duke's consent to his son's marriage with Henrietta, provided her aunt would act as generously to-wards her, as she had formerly given her reason to expect.
               
                  From several hints (said he) which lady Meadows has thrown out, and from the great kindness she expresses for me, I am ap-prehensive that she intends to transfer her bounty from my sister to me; but as my cir-cumstances, though not affluent, are easy, and as I have nothing so much at heart as the happiness of my friend and my sister, I will most: chearfully relinquish in her favour all my expectations from lady Meadows. The pros-pect of so advantageous a match will pro-bably have some weight with her aunt; and the mention of it will come with propriety from you, sir, as the guardian of Henrietta. Lady Meadows will then explain herself clearly; and we shall have an opportunity given us of pressing her to remove, by her

generosity, the only obstacle that obstructs my sister's advancement.
               
               Mr. Bale was prodigiously affected with the uncommon nobleness of this proceeding. He took the young gentleman's hand, and, giving it an affectionate shake,
I shall love and ho-nour you while I live (said he) for this ge-nerous proposal: doubt not of my ready con-currence in every measure for your sister's ad-vantage. I love her as well as if she was my own daughter; and the inconveniences she has suffered through the folly and imprudence of some of my family, require that I should make her amends, by doing every thing in my power to make her happy.
               
               "I will wait upon lady MeadoWs," pursued he,
to-morrow in the afternoon, and then we will talk over this affair.
Mr. Courte-ney told him, he would prepare his aunt for the visit he intended her. After which, Mr, Bale went away, and he joined his sister and her friend. A coach being ordered, they took leave of Mrs. Willis, whom Henrietta promised to visit again very speedily. Mr. Courteney had some discourse with his sister as they went, con-cerning the marquis; but carefully avoided mentioning his design to her, lest he should

raise hopes which might be unhappily disap-pointed.
               Henrietta was under some perturbation at the thoughts of appearing before her aunt, whose displeasure, against her, and unjust suspicions, all recurred to her memory; but the reception the old lady gave her, immediately effaced those impressions: it was perfectly kind and affec-tionate, without the least mixture of upbraiding or reproach.
               "I had a mind to surprise you, madam," said Mr. Courteney, who with infinite pleasure beheld his sister so tenderly embraced by her aunt. Lady Meadows assured him, that he had surprised her very agreeably; and, again embracing Henrietta, told her, that her good friend, the countess of â€”, had been very lavish in her praise, and had acquainted her with several circumstances of her conduct, which had raised her highly in her opi-nion.
               
                  I suppose you will not be very much grieved (added the old lady, smiling) to hear that your former lover lord Bâ€” is married to the citizen's daughter.
               
               "No, indeed, madam," replied Henrietta, "they seemed to be formed for each other."
               
                  
"They are not very happy, I hear," said lady Meadows; who, having fallen upon the article of domestic news, related a great number of anecdotes concerning her acquaintance, some of which Henrietta had often,heard before. The old lady's fondness for talking at length gave way to her curiosity to hear every thing that had happened to her niece during their sepa-ration.
               Henrietta gratified it with discretion, suppres-sing whatever might tend to revive disagreeable remembrances. She was now put into posses-sion of her former apartment, and had an op-portunity that night to congratulate her old friend Mrs. White (who assisted her to undress) upon her being reinstated in the favour of her lady.
            
            
               

               CHAP. XII.
               
                  Which concludes the history.
               
               THE next day Mr. Courteney informed lady Meadows, that Mr. Bale intended to wait on her, and hinted that he had a match to propose for Henrietta, which he hoped she would approve.
               Lady Meadows, who had already taken her resolution with regard to both brother and sister, told him, that she was very desirous of seeing her niece settled; and that she was determined never to oppose her inclinations, being con-vinced that her virtue and prudence were to be entirely depended upon.
               Mr. Bale came according to his appointment; and, being soon after left alone with lady Mea-dows, he acquainted her with the whole affair between the marquis of â€” and Henrietta, as he had received it from Mr. Courteney; and, observing that the old lady was dazzled with the prospect of her niece becoming a dutchess, added, that the want of a suitable fortune should not

hinder the advancement of Henrietta:
for whatever you design for her, madam (said he) I will double; so great is my regard for her, and admiration of her virtues.
               
               Lady Meadows with reason thought this a very generous proposal. She complimented him upon it; and, stepping to her cabinet, took out a box that contained her will, and another deed which had been drawn up, while Mr. Courte-ney was in the country with the duke of â€”, but were not yet executed. She put these papers into Mr. Bale's hands, and desired him to read them, saying,
you will there see, sir, what I intend to do for my nephew and his sister.
               
               Mr. Bale opened the first, which was the will. He found she had constituted Mr. Cour-teney her heir, leaving him her whole estate, charging it only with the sum of five thousand pounds, to be paid his sister on the day of her marriage. The other paper contained a settle-ment of three hundred pounds a year upon Mr. Courteney during her life.
               Mr. Bale, who knew the young gentleman's sentiments, proposed to lady Meadows to send for him, and acquaint him with her intentions. To this she readily agreed. Mr. Courteney

turned pale when he heard the moderate sum designed for his sister; and, after expressing his gratitude to lady Meadows for the favour she shewed him, in terms the most respectful and affectionate, he earnestly conjured her to let Henrietta be at least an equal sharer with him in her kindness. He urged, as a motive to her to comply, the very advantageous match that was proposed to his sister. He expatiated on the marquis's tender and faithful passion for her; and touched with great delicacy upon the sen-timents Henrietta could not avoid entertaining for a young nobleman, who had loved her with honour, even when ignorant of her birth, and when she was under very humiliating circum-stances.
               Lady Meadows interrupted him with the most flattering praises of his disinterestedness; but declared that her resolution was unalterable. "Your sister will have ten thousand pounds," said she;
this is no despicable fortune: and since there is so much love on the side of the marquis, there is no doubt but it will be thought sufficient.
               
               Mr. Bale explained the old lady's meaning, by telling him what he proposed to do for miss Courteney, and preventing the young gentle-man's

acknowledgments:
You have sufficiently shewn your regard for your sister (said he) and I am of opinion we ought not to press lady Meadows any more on this subject; she has acted nobly by you both.
               
               The lady was extremely flattered by the praise Mr. Bale gave her; and, to prevent any more solicitations from her nephew, she signed the papers immediately, which Mr. Bale, at her request, witnessed.
               Mr. Courteney said every thing that grati-tude and politeness could suggest, upon her pre-senting him the settlement; yet there was an air of concern upon his countenance, which Mr. Bale observing, took an opportunity to desire him, in a whisper, to meet him at a coffee-house (which he named to him) that evening, having something to say to him, which he hoped would make all things easy.
               Mr. Courteney promised to attend him. He then begged lady Meadows not to let Henrietta know what had passed with regard to the mar-quis.
At present (said he) she considers this marriage as impossible to be effected, and so I would have her consider it, till I am sure that the duke will make no objection to the fortune that is designed her.
Lady

as the greatest. I am, madam, with all due gratitude and respect, your obliged and very humble servant,
                     
                        HENRIETTA COURTENEY.
                     
                  
               
               
                  I must approve, nay admire your resolu-tion, miss,
said Mrs. Willis, returning the letter;
and if you persist in it, you will ap-pear to me a wonder.
               
               "Do you doubt my persisting in it?" replied Henrietta.
               "When I consider," said Mrs. Willis,
your birth, your youth, your beauty, and the ex-pectations you have been encouraged to enter-tain, I know it must cost you a great deal to throw away the advantages that are offered you, and which possibly you might secure by temporising at least.
               
               "Dissimulation," interrupted Henrietta,
on any occasion, is mean and scandalous; but in matters of religion it is surely a heinous crime; and I hope I am far enough from committing it; but I own I have many mo-tives to stimulate my resolution.
               
               
                  My own imprudence, and the treachery of others, have given a wound to my reputa-tion, which a voluntary poverty can only re-pair.

Meadows approved of his caution; and Mr. Bale was desired to visit her in her own apart-ment, and acquaint her with the dispositions made by her aunt.
               Henrietta expressed the highest satisfaction at what had been done for her beloved brother, and, with the greatest sweetness, acknowledged her obligations to her aunt for the provision she had made for her: but when Mr. Bale acquainted her with the addition he designed to make to the fortune her aunt would give her, tears of ten-derness and gratitude overspread her face, and she could utter no more, than,
O! sir, how generousâ€” how kind is thisâ€” how shall I re-pay such unexampled goodnessâ€”
               
               Mr. Bale interrupted her soft exclamations, to lead her down stairs to her aunt, to whom she paid her acknowledgments with inimitable grace, and congratulated her brother with so sincere a joy, that he, who knew how much she was likely to lose by his good fortune, was moved al-most to tears.
               Mr. Bale a short time afterwards took his leave, and went to the coffee-house, where he had appointed Mr. Courteney to meet him. He was soon followed by the young gentleman,

whose mind was under great agitations on his sister's account.
               "One would hardly imagine," said Mr. Bale to him, smiling,
that you have just been de-clared heir to a good estate, you look like one disappointed and unhappy.
               
               "I am indeed disappointed, sir," replied Mr. Courteney;
I had laid a plan to make my sister and my friend happy: but my aunt's partiality has broke all my measures for the present.
               
               "Then you intend," said Mr. Bale, who had taken particular notice of his last words,
to make some addition to your sister's fortune, when the estate comes into your hands?
               
               
                  Certainly, sir (replied Mr. Courteney) I should but ill deserve it, if I did not.
               
               
                  It must be confessed (resumed Mr. Bale) that you are a very good brother.
               
               
                  All that I can do for my sister, sir (said he) will be but bare justice; but your generosity t
                        â€¢
                      her can never be enough admired.
               
               "No more of that," interrupted Mr. Bale.
I love your sister: she is a worthy young wo-man; I am grieved to think so noble a match for her, should meet with any obstruction for

the want of a fortune. What do you think the duke will expect?
               
               "The lady he has proposed to his son, sir," said Mr. Courteney,
has twenty thousand pounds; and it would have been my pride and happiness to have prevailed with my aunt to make my sister's fortune equal to that.
               
               "Is it possible!" cried Mr. Bale, surprised.
Why fifteen thousand pounds is at least one third of your aunt's fortune?
               
               "My sister," said Mr. Courteney,
has a right to expect it. The whole would have been her's but for some unlucky acci-dents, and the strange partiality of lady Mea-dows for me. All that I can now do is, to let the marquis know, that my sister will have ten thousand pounds paid on the day of her marriage, and ten thousand more on the death of her aunt. The duke loves money; and I greatly doubt whether all his son's soli-citations will make him relish this reversionary ten thousand pounds.
               
               "We will not put it to the hazard," inter-rupted Mr. Bale,
since you are determined to act thus generously by your sister, I will lay down the money myself, and all the security

I require, is your bond for the re-payment of it, when your aunt's estate comes into your possession.
               
               Mr. Courteney was so overwhelmed with sur-prise, joy, and gratitude, for this unexpected, noble offer, that, during some moments, he was unable to utter a word. But this silence, accompanied with looks the most expressive that can be imagined, was more eloquent than any language could be. Recovering himself at last, he was beginning to pay the warmest acknow-ledgments; but Mr. Bale would not suffer him to proceed.
               
                  I am impatient (said he) for the conclusion of this affair. Write to your friend imme-diately, and let him know that your sister's guardian will treat with the duke his father, whenever he pleases.
               
               Mr. Courteney, at his reiterated request, took leave of him, and went home, in order to com-municate this joyful news to his friend. Hear-ing that lady Meadows and his sister were en-gaged in company, he went to his own apart-ment, and wrote a short letter to the marquis, in which he acquainted him, that his sister being restored to the favour of her aunt, he had it now in his power to assure him, that if he con-tinued

in the same sentiments towards her, and could prevail with his grace to authorise them by his consent, he was impowered by her aunt and her guardian, to declare that her fortune would be twenty thousand pounds.
               Having sealed and dispatched this letter to the post, he joined the company below stairs, with looks so full of satisfaction, and a behaviour animated with such extraordinary gaiety, that lady Meadows was more than ever delighted with him, concluding that the noble provision she had made for him, was the source of his joy; but Henrietta, who knew her brother better, and who besides saw something particular in those looks, which he from time to time gave her, felt strange flutterings in her gentle bosom: hopes checked as soon as formed; wishes sup-pressed as they rose. In these perturbations, she passed that night and the three following days.
               Mean time the marquis, having received Mr. Courteney's letter, was so surprised at this sudden change in the fortune of Henrietta, that he read it over several times before he could per-suade himself what he saw was real. His first emotions were all transport: every obstacle to his marriage was now removed; and he might

solicit his father's consent, with a certainty al-most of not being denied. Yet a sentiment of delicacy and tenderness made him regret, that it was not in his power to convince Henrietta of the disinterestedness of his love, and for some moments rendered him insensible of his present happiness.
               The duke came into his chamber, while he was reading the letter the twentieth time, and so intently, that he did not perceive his en-trance. When suddenly raising his eyes, and seeing his father, who, suspecting that this letter, which he seemed to read with so much emotion, came from his mistress, was looking earnestly on him.
               
                  O! my lord (cried he) there is nothing wanting to make me perfectly happy, but your consent to my marriage with miss Courteney. See, my lord, what her brother writes: her brother, who till now has so obstinately op-posed my passion!
               
               The duke took the letter out of his hands, and having read it, returned it to him again without speaking a word, and walked to the other end of the room. The marquis, who saw nothing unfavourable in his looks, followed him, and, throwing himself at his feet, conjured him

not to oppose his happiness any longer. The duke desired time to consider; but his son would not give over his solicitations, till he had ob-tained leave of him to visit miss Courteney, and to declare that his addresses had the sanction of his consent.
               The happy marquis gave orders instantly for his post-chaise to be got ready, which his fa-ther at first did not oppose; but, after reflecting a little,
               
                  Can you not rein in your impatience for a few days?
said he to him;
I intend to be in town next week: I shall then have an opportunity of seeing the young lady (and, since you are so obstinately bent upon the match) of talking to her aunt and her guar-dian.
               
               The marquis would not disoblige his father, by making any objections to this little delay, grievous as it was to him; but retired to write to Mr. Courteney, whom he acquainted with the duke's intentions, and, anticipating the tender name of brother, poured out his whole heart in the warmest expressions of love, friend-ship, joy, and every soft emotion with which he was agitated.
               
                  
Mr. Courteney having communicated this letter to Mr. Bale, he agreed that it was ne-cessary to make lady Meadows acquainted with the steps they had taken in the affair. She en-tered with a good grace into the generous designs of her nephew in favour of his sister.
               "If I had done more for her," said she to him, smiling,
you would not have had an opportunity of doing so much.
Mr. Cour-teney kissed her hand with a tender and respect-ful air.
               "Go," said she, with a look that shewed she was highly pleased;
go, and tell your sister this good news; and tell her also that I am impatient to embrace and congratulate her.
               
               Mr. Courteney willingly obeyed her. He went to Henrietta's apartment, and, seeing her sitting pensive and melancholy, he began to rally her upon her tenderness for the marquis. She bore it with great sweetness, but not with-out some surprise; for her brother was used to be very delicate and reserved upon that subject. By degrees he assumed a more serious tone; and at length gave her to understand, that the mar-quis was now permitted by his father to pay his addresses to her.
               
                  
Henrietta blushed and trembled from the mo-ment her brother began to speak to her in a serious manner. Her emotions increased as he proceeded; yet she laboured to conceal them, till Mr. Courteney, explaining to her what Mr. Bale had done for her, which necessarily in-cluded his own generous gift, that innate deli-cacy, which had forced her joy to be silent, suf-fered her gratitude to shew itself in the most lively expressions. Lady Meadows came into the room, and gave a seasonable interruption to these tender effusions of her heart, which Mr. Courteney had listened to with a kind of painful pleasure. She embraced her niece, and con-gratulated her on her happy fortune.
               Miss Courteney, who had now reason to ex-pect a visit from the marquis, was not much sur-prised a few days afterwards to see his equipage at the door. After a few moments conversation with Mr. Courteney, he was introduced to lady Meadows, who received him with great respect. Henrietta blushed a little when he appeared, but recovered herself, and received the tender and respectful compliment he made her with her usual grace.
               A great deal of company coming in soon af-terwards, he found means to engage her apart for a quarter of an hour. Their conversation

was such as might be expected between persons of their sense and politeness, who loved each other with the utmost tenderness, and now for the first time saw themselves at liberty to declare their sentiments. Henrietta did not scruple to own to the man, who had so nobly merited her esteem, that her heart had received a most tender impression for him; and this soft acknow-ledgment completed her lover's felicity.
               Mr. Courteney waited upon the duke the next morning, and had the pleasure to hear from his own mouth, that he was entirely satisfied with his son's proceedings. His grace visited lady Meadows the same day; and was so charmed with Henrietta, that he scarce disco-vered less impatience than his son, for the con-clusion of the marriage. Every thing being agreed on between the duke and Mr. Bale, with regard to settlements, the writings were drawn up with all convenient speed, and a day ap-pointed for the marriage.
               Lady Meadows, though a Roman catholic, allowed the ceremony to be performed at her house: after which, the new-married pair, with the old lady, the duke, Mr. Bale, and Mr. Courteney, set out for his grace's country seat.
               
                  

In this licentious age, she, who with youth and even the slightest advantages of person, dares to be poor, deserves surely to be thought virtuous; and I shall ever acknowledge the bounty of Providence, that, amidst the un-just censures which have been cast on me, has made an humble lot my choice.
               
               "I am satisfied," interrupted Mrs. Willis:
reason, I see, has a greater share in your so lately formed resolution, than the zeal of en-thusiasm, or the suggestions of vanity; and you may believe me a true friend to your fame, when I heartily congratulate you on your pre-sent situation. And now, my dear miss, suffer me to assure you of my tenderest friend-ship; a friendship which cannot be contented with bare professions, and insists upon your putting it to some trial.
               
               
                  Tell me how I can serve you? O! that you would honour me so far as to let this house be your asylum till fortune does justice to your merit. Condescend to live with me, my dear miss, and share my little income.
               
               "You are very kind, dear Mrs. Willis," re-plied Henrietta;
but my circumstances will not permit me to continue your boarder, and no distress shall oblige me to be burthensome to a friend. I have already resolved how to
The charming marchioness did not make her first public appearance in town till late in the ensuing winter; when her beauty, her suf-ferings, her virtue, and her good fortune, were for a long time the subjects of conversation.
               Mr. Courteney, happy in the conscious in-tegrity of his heart, happy in the ardent affec-tion of his sister and the marquis, and the esteem of all who knew him, was, by the death of lady Meadows, which happened a few months after his sister's marriage, enabled to discharge his obligations to Mr. Bale. His generosity was not long unrewarded: an opu-lent heiress fell desperately in love with him; she was related to the duke, who interested himself so warmly in the affair, that the mar-riage was soon concluded.
               Lord Bâ€”, as has been observed already, lived very unhappy with his plebeian lady. The sight of the charming Henrietta renewed his passion. Tortured with remorse, disappoint-ment, and despair, he had recourse to the bottle, and fell an early sacrifice to intempe-rance.
               Miss Woodby, who had always a violent passion for a red-coat, listened to the sighs

of a young cadet, and married him in a week after their first acquaintance. Her excuse for this precipitancy was, that the lovely youth would certainly have stabbed himself, if she had delayed his happiness any longer. With part of her fortune he bought a commission, and spent the rest in a few months. After which, he went abroad with his regiment, leaving her, in an obscure retirement, to be-wail his absence, and sooth her love-sick heart, with hopes that he would return more pas-sionate than ever, and lay all his laurels at her feet.
               Miss Belmour, forsaken by her lover, became a proselyte to the Roman catholic religion, and retired to a convent, where the nuns wrought her up to such a degree of enthusiasm, that she settled her whole fortune upon the community, and took the veil; but soon afterwards, repent-ing of this rash step, she died of grief, remorse, and disappointment.
               Mrs. Willis was generously rewarded by the marchioness, for the many kind and faithful ser-vices she had received from her: and Mr. Bale, who highly esteemed her for her behaviour to his beauteous ward, settled her husband in such an advantageous way, that in a few years he made a considerable fortune.
               
                  
The younger Mr. Bale found, in the inces-sant clamours of a jealous wife, a sufficient pu-nishment for his treacherous designs on Hen-rietta; and it was not without great difficulty, that he was restored to his father's favour.
               Every branch of the Courteney family made frequent advances towards a reconciliation with the marchioness and her brother: but ge-nerous as they were, they had too just a sense of the indignities they had suffered from them, to admit of it; and, in this steady resentment, they had, as it usually happens with successful persons, the world on their side.
            
            THE END.
         
      
   


dispose of myself, and, in the scheme I have formed, I shall need your assistance.
               
               "Tell me, my dear," cried Mrs. Willis, eagerly, "how I can be of any use to you?"
               "You must," replied Henrietta, blushing a little:
you must get me a service, my dear Mrs. Willis.
               
               "A service!" exclaimed the good woman.
               "I am very well qualified," resumed Hen-rietta, recovering from her first confusion, and smiling,
to wait upon a woman of fashion: for my mother gave me a useful as well as genteel education; and this station will be at once private enough to secure me from dis-agreeable accidents, and publick enough to make my conduct acquit or condemn me.
               
               "I will not," added she, observing Mrs. Willis continued silent,
offer myself to any place by my own name; that would look like an insult upon my great relations, and be perhaps an obstruction to my success. It is sufficient for me, that whenever I am disco-vered, it may be in circumstances at which they, not I, need be ashamed.
               
               
                  When I first heard you mention this scheme,
said Mrs. Willis,
I thought I could never be brought to approve it; but a little reflection has convinced me that it may

have good consequences. You cannot be long concealed; that graceful form will soon draw notice upon you. Whenever you are known to be in a station so unworthy your birth and merit, the pride of your relations will be rouzed. How glorious then will this humiliation be for you! Methinks I see their confusion for their neglect of you, and their eagerness to repair it, by restoring you to the rank you was born inâ€” Oh! my dear, you will certainly be happy yet, I am sure you will.
               
               Henrietta smiled a little at the good woman's sanguine expectations; but in reality, the same thoughts had made a great impression upon her, and contributed, more than she imagined, to allay the uneasiness she felt at being reduced to take such a step. By degrees she formed in her own mind so romantick a scene, that she grew impatient to enter upon it, and again intreated the assistance of Mrs. Willis.
               The good woman telling her that a cousin of her husband's was a sack-maker, and in great vogue at the court end of the town, it was agreed that she should go to her, and en-gage her good offices towards recommending the young lady to a place; it being very likely that

among her customers, who were mostly women of quality, she might hear of one that would suit her.
            
            
               CHAP. IV.
               
                  Which contains very trifling matters.
               
               MRS. Willis succeeded beyond her hopes; the mantua-maker had been desired by a lady she worked for, to look out for a genteel young person to serve her in the quality of her woman; and promised her cousin, that she would mention her friend to the lady the next day, being to wait on her with some cloaths that were to be tried on. She added, that the lady was a citizen, but had an immense for-tune, and that her place was certainly a very good one.
               Henrietta seemed very well pleased with her landlady's success, though she was not free from some uneasy perturbations at the thoughts of the condition she was so soon to enter upon.
               Mrs. Measure did not fail to visit her cousin the next day.
Well (said she) I have done the young gentlewoman's business: she has

nothing to do but to wait upon miss Cord-wain; and, if she likes her figure, she will hire her directly.
               
               "Why, pray," replied Mrs. Willis,
what kind of figure will best please this lady?
               
               "Oh!" cried Mrs. Measure,
miss Cord-wain's woman must be very genteel, and look like a gentlewoman; the richer she is dressed too, when she goes to wait on her, the better. Every thing about miss Cordwain must be magnificent. Well,
pursued she, laughing, and taking a pinch of snuff, which produced several little pauses in her discourse,
it is really surprising to see these little cits, how they mimick people of qualityâ€”They must be so extravagantly in the fashionâ€”I vow and protest the negligee I tried on miss Cordwain to-day, had a train three yards and a half long.
               
               Henrietta that moment entering the room, Mrs. Willis, seeing her cousin was surprised at her appearance, said, this is the young gentle-woman who wants a place.
               The mantua-maker, upon this information, resumed her familiar look and manner; and, throwing herself again upon her chair, took a full survey of the young lady, who thanked her, with some hesitation, and a blush that crim-soned

over her face, for the service she had done her.
               "I have just been telling my cousin," said Mrs. Measure,
that miss Cordwain, the lady I have recommended you to, ma'am, is very hard to be pleased. Her woman must look like a lady forsooth: she has refused three that went to see her place; one, because she had a red hand; it looked, she said, as if the creature had stood at a wash-tub; another, because she went to be hired in a linen gown; and the third, because she had lived with no-body of higher rank than a baronet's wifeâ€” But I am sure she can have no objection to you, ma'am, unless perhaps she may think you too handsome. Do you take snuff, ma'am?
offering her box, which Henrietta civilly declined.
               "But dear ma'am," pursued the mantua-maker,
who makes your cloaths? I never saw any thing so frightful as the slope of that ruffle, then such a horrid sleeve: it is well, you are naturally genteel.
               
               Henrietta slightly bowed in return for this compliment; and asked her, at what hour it would be proper to wait upon miss Cord-wain?
               
                  
"About one o'clock in the forenoon," re-plied Mrs. Measure,
that's her breakfast time. Her father, honest man, is in his warehouse before six. But this is his only daughter; and he expects she will be a duchess, or countess at leastâ€” She has fifty thousand pounds.
               
               "Where does the lady live?" asked Henrietta.
               "Here in one of your filthy lanes," replied the mantua-maker;
I forget the name of it, but every body knows Mr. Cordwain the packer.
               
               She then rose up, made one of her best cour-tesies, and hurried into a chair that was waiting for her; for this polite mantua-maker was above visiting her customers in a hackney coach: and this insolence was such a proof of her excellence in her business, that few ever scrupled to pay for it.

               HEnrietta having summoned all her resolu-tion, that she might acquit herself with propriety of the task she had undertaken, pre-pared the next day to wait upon miss Cordwain. She remembered the mantua-maker's hint, and therefore avoided any studied simplicity in her dress; but no apparel, however mean, could have hid that noble air, or disguised that na-tive elegance, so conspicuous throughout her whole person.
               As soon as she was ready, she stepped in to Mrs. Willis's parlour, and, while a coach was sent for, assumed a more than ordinary chear-fulness in her discourse with the good woman; for she was extremely desirous of concealing the emotions she felt upon this mortifying occasion, and affected a most heroick indifference, while inly she suffered all that a mind, de
                     â€¢â€¢
                  cate and sensible as her's, could feel.
               Mrs. Willis followed her to the door with tears in her eyes. The young lady stepped into the coach, smiled a farewel, and ordered

the coachman to drive to Mr. Cordwain's. A few minutes brought her to the house; and the servant, of whom she enquired if miss Cordwain was at home, having shewn her into a parlour, bowed and withdrew.
               Miss Cordwain being informed that a lady enquired for her, ordered her admittance; and the same servant returning, conducted Henrietta to her dressing-room.
               Miss Cordwain, who was still lingering over her tea-table with a female acquaintance, rose up at Henrietta's graceful entrance, and, re-ceiving her with a low courtesy, offered her an arm-chair at the upper-end of the room.
               Henrietta, conscious of the error she had committed in not making use of the mantua-maker's name before, blushed a little at this reception, which was not suitable to the cha-racter she was to appear in, and, declining the chair; "Mrs. Measure, madam," said she. She could utter no more than those two words; but they were sufficient to give miss Cordwain to understand her business.
               The haughty citizen was excessively shocked to find she had been betrayed by the figure of Henrietta into so improper an instance of respect; and that the person she took for a lady of dis-tinction was the young woman who had been

recommended to her service, thought to recover the dignity which she conceived she had lost from this mistake, by assuming an imperious air and an insolent accent.
               "Who did you live with last?" said she to Henrietta, throwing herself again into her chair, and glancing her over with a supercilious eye;
I hope it was with a woman of quality: you will not do for me, I can tell you, if you have not been used to attend upon persons of rank.
               
               Henrietta, notwithstanding the confusion she was under at acting so strange a part, could not help being diverted with the pride of this daugh-ter of trade.
               "I am afraid, madam," said she,
I shall not be worthy of your place; for I never lived in the service of any woman of quality, nor indeed in any other.
               
               "What you are a gentlewoman, I suppose," interrupted miss Cordwain, drawling out the word gentlewoman;
and now I remember Measure told me you had never been in ser-vice. Well, that does not signify: I have no objection to your having been a gentlewoman; you may be the better servant for what I know. For to say the truth,
said she, addressing herself to her companion,
those sort of poor

gentlewomen, when they are reduced, as they call it, to wait upon us, who could buy their whole generation, often know their distance better, and are more humble than such as have been bred to service.
               
               Oh!" said the other lady, with an applauding smile,
ever while you live, madam, chuse a gentlewoman for your maid. There is alder-man Fig the grocer's lady: I have heard He often declare she never was so well served as when colonel Noble's daughter waited on her. The colonel was killed in the last war; and, as those folks you know have seldom any thing to leave their families, his fine gay daughters were obliged to go to service after his death, and did very well; but some body left them ten thousand pounds a piece, and spoiled two excellent servants, by making them gentle-women again.
               
               "Nay, if they had fortunes left them," re-plied miss Cordwain, "why you know, then, "they had a right to be called gentlewomen.
               "Well, child," pursued she, turning to Henrietta,
as I told you before I have no ob-jection to your having been a gentlewoman; for I am resolved never to have any other to wait on me: I shall take you upon Measure's

recommendation, and the sooner you come the better.
               
               Henrietta, who had really enjoyed the con-versation that had passed between these two la-dies, told her that she would come whenever she pleased; and it being agreed she should come the following day, that she might dress her new lady for a city-feast, she courtesied profoundly low, and withdrew.
               Henrietta, whose imagination was naturally lively, and not wholly free from those romantic notions which persons of her age readily admit, began to consider her transformation from the niece of lady Meadows, and a presumptive heiress, into the waiting-maid of a cit, as one of those caprices of fate which never fail to pro-duce surprising effects. She could not help fan-cying herself the future heroine of some affect-ing tale, whose life would be varied with sur-prising vicissitudes of fortune; and that she would at last be raised to a rank as much above her hopes, as the station she was now entering upon was below all that her fears had ever suggested.
               But these reflections were succeeded by others more reasonable, and which indeed afforded her a more solid satisfaction: she was going to re-fute the censures of an injurious world; to make that innocence which had been so vilely tra-duced

manifest, in her chearful submission to poverty and servitude, at a time when a shining fortune was offered to purchase a change in her religious principles, and when perhaps a little dissimulation, or a temporary compliance with her aunt's proposals, might restore her to a rank in life suitable to her birth.
               The satisfaction she felt from these pleasing ideas, diffused such a serenity over her fair face, as agreeably surprised Mrs. Willis, who had waited her return with impatience.
               Henrietta repeated to her the dialogue that had passed between the two ladies with so much humour, and marked the pride of wealth, and aukward affectation of grandeur and distinction, in these opulent heiresses to the laborious gains of sordid thrift, and perhaps successful knavery, with such delicate strokes of satire as convinced Mrs. Willis she would not be an injudicious ob-server of the manners of those whom it might be her lot to associate with, nor pass through this new scene of life, without drawing improve-ment from it.
               The good woman was grieved to find that she must lose her so soon; but, being fully per-suaded that this humiliating step would termi-nate in something happy for her fair friend, she disposed herself to part with her chearfully.
               
                  
It was agreed between them, that the elder Mr. Bale should not be made acquainted with any part of his son's behaviour with regard to Henrietta, till his return from Holland, when the whole affair might be laid candidly before him; and that the younger should be told, that she was gone into service; but where, he was not to be informed.
               The next day Henrietta, after taking a tender farewel of Mrs. Willis, repaired to her new dwelling. Miss Cordwain was just gone out to make some little purchases for the evening; and Henrietta, being directed to go into her lady's dressing-room, was met by her predecessor, who had lingered in the house to have an opportunity of speaking to her, that, according to the ge-neral custom of servants, she might prejudice her against her new mistress.
               From this girl, who was not sparing in her invectives, she learned that miss Cordwain's temper, which was not naturally good, was ex-tremely sowered of late by a disappointment in love; that the packer, her father, had been treating with a certain nobleman for a ma
                     â€¢â€¢
                  h be-tween her and the nobleman's eldest son; but that it had been broke off, because the citizen had refused to lay down more than thirty thou-sand

pounds with his daughter, and the noble-man insisted upon forty.
               This little piece of history was followed by a thousand other family anecdotes; to all which Henrietta listened in silence, and was not sorry that the censorious waiting-woman, whose tongue had, during a whole hour, run with sur-prising volubility, was at length silenced by the arrival of miss Cordwain; whose voice when she heard on the stairs, she took a hasty leave, and retreated thro' a different door from that which the lady entered.
               Miss Cordwain, as soon as she saw Hen-rietta, slightly inclined her head, in return to her respectful courtesy; and throwing some mil-lenary trifles upon her toilet, she sat down to her glass, and ordered her new woman to comb her hair, shewing a fretful impatience at her hair-dresser's long delay; for she was to meet her company at nine o'clock, and it was now almost four: so that she had good reason to fear she should hardly have time enough to dress.
               While Henrietta was acquitting herself han-dily enough of this task, her lady took up a col-
                  
                     â€¢
                  ection of songs that lay upon her table, that she might improve her mind while her body was 
                     â€¢
                  dorning; and after reading intently a few mo-ments

to herself, she hastily turned over the leaves to a place that was doubled down, and began to read aloud a most piteous complaint of a despairing nymph, whose lover had forsaken her for another: she concluded this doleful ditty with a deep sigh; and repeating the burden of it, for men are as false as the changeable wind, "Henrietta," said she,
was you ever in love?
               
               Our fair heroine, who understood this ques-tion as a prelude to a confidence from her mistress, was at some loss how to answer it, when she was relieved from her perplexity by the ar-rival of monsieur Finesse, the French hair-cutter.
               Miss Cordwain, immediately dropping her tender languishments, assumed a supercilious air; and, after haughtily interrogating the inge-nious artist for not coming sooner, submitted her tresses to his forming hands, a settled gloom all the time clouding her face: for whether it was that her glass, on which her eyes were intently fixed, told her some unpleasing truths, or that her gentle bosom heaved with some secret dis-content, but it is certain that every thing dis-pleased her; nor could all Henrietta's obliging attention to the adorning her person draw a smile of approbation from her.
               
                  
After five hours labour, however, the lady was completely dressed. Her father, who had not seen her since dinner, which she had swallowed in haste, having so much business on her hands, now entered the room; and liking the shewy appearance she made, "Why, Jenny," said he, "you are as fine as a duchess."
               "As fine as a duchess," repeated she, pout-ing; "and why not?"
               "Very true, girl," replied the father,
thou hast that which can make duchesses: but, Jenny, I have something to say to thee in pri-vate; so send your waiting-maid away.
               
               Henrietta immediately retired into her mis-tress's bedchamber; which being only separated from the dressing-room by a slight partition of wainscot, she could not avoid hearing every thing that passed.
               
                  I have had a proposal made me this after-noon,
resumed the father,
and I came to acquaint you with it. Mr. Traffick has asked you in marriage; there's immense riches for you, girl: what say you?
               
               "Sure, papa," cried miss Cordwain hastily,
you have not given him any encouragement, have you? A fine match, indeed! so I must be called plain Mrs. Traffick all my days, and there's miss Fig married to a viscount,

and has coronets upon her coach: three weeks ago, miss Haggle, the broker's daughter, became a countess; and but this very morn-ing I heard that the duke of Hazard is court-ing miss Steam, our neighbour the soapboiler's niece, and she has but twenty thousand pounds.â€”I can't bear it; so, I can't,
pur-sued miss Cordwain, bursting into tears,
to see all my comrades at Hackney boarding-school married to right honourables, and I am not likely to be even a paltry baronet's wife.
               
               Here her tears and sobs suppressed any far-ther utterance, and had such an effect upon the fond father, that he also was ready to cry.
               "Don't break my heart, Jenny," said he, half sobbing;
you know it is death to me to see you fret and grieve yourself: are you not my only child? is it not for you that I have been toiling and labouring for these forty years, up early and down late, scraping all I can to-gether, gaining much and spending little, and all to make you a peeress of Great Britain, and a peeress you shall be; so don't cry, my girl, and spoil your complexion; neither neigh-bour Fig, nor neighbour Haggle's daughter, shall be greater than you. You shall be a countess, Jenny, will that content you? I

will lay down the odd ten thousand, that the earl of â€” and I quarrelled about, and you shall have his son.
               
               "I am obliged to you, papa," said miss Cord-wain; "butâ€”"
               "Nay," interrupted the father,
I find nothing will please you: you were crying just now, because you were not a countess; and when I tell you you that I will part with an-other ten thousand pounds, to make you easy, you come with your buts.
               
               "Why, suppose I am a countess," replied miss Cordwain,
will not miss Steam be a duchess, and take place of me? I can never endure that.
               
               "What signifies her taking place of you," said her father,
the duke's estate is not half so good as the earl of â€”; besides, you refused a duke, you know, and you have often told me that you like lord Bâ€” better than any man in the world, and how have you pined since the match was broke off!
               
               "Well, I confess," replied miss,
that I do like my lord Bâ€”, and would rather marry him than any duke in the land, pro-vided that little odious thing, miss Steam, did not marry above me: she to be called her

grace at every word, while I am only lady Bâ€”; I should die with vexation.
               
               "Since it is so," said the father,
I shall lay aside my design, and make no advances to the earl.
               
               
                  And then his son will marry some body else,
cried miss Cordwain.
               "What would the girl be at?" interrupted the good man, with some heat;
if you won't have him, need you care who has.
               
               Miss Cordwain now burst into a flood of tears: she liked lord Bâ€”, but she could not bear the thoughts of miss Steam's being in a rank above her; and love and envy raised such tumults in her breast, as made her seek a relief in tears.
               "I wish you knew your own mind, girl," said the father half angry, and half concerned at her grief.
               "I know my own mind well enough," re-plied miss sullenly:
I would marry lord Bâ€”, and I would not have that proud 
                        
                      be a duchess.
               
               "Take my word for it," said the father,
she will never be duchess of Hazard; I know her fortune is not sufficient to ch
                        â€¢â€¢
                     r the duke's estate of two mortgages that have almost swal-lowed it up.
               
               
                  
"Nay, then," interrupted miss Cordwain, who eagerly admitted an argument that set her mind at ease,
I am sure the duke will not have her; for she is so ugly you know, papa, that nothing could charm him but her riches.
               
               "Well," said the father, smiling with plea-sure, to see her in good humour again,
I am to meet a friend of the earl's to-night; shall this affair be brought on again?
               
               "As you please, papa," said miss Cordwain, courtesying;
you know it is my duty to be obedient.
               
               "Aye," said the good man, kissing her,
you have always been one of the most dutiful chil-dren in the world; and I will make thee a lady, though I don't leave myself a shilling.
With this wise declaration he quitted the room, leaving his daughter in high spirits; who, after she had called her maid to adjust whatever might be amiss in her dress, and taken a full survey of herself in the glass, stepped into her coach, with the air of a citizen who had a fortune of forty thousand pounds.
            
            
               

               CHAP. VI.
               
                  Contains an incident which the sagacious reader has probably foreseen.
               
               HEnrietta, when she was left alone, found sufficient matter for reflection in the senti-ments and behaviour of this wealthy tradesman and his daughter; and as it was now become necessary for her own peace of mind to reconcile herself to the situation that fortune had placed her in, she endeavoured to extract useful lessons from every scene that passed under her observa-tion.
               Why have I lamented my poverty? said she to herself; riches neither give understanding to the mind, nor elegance to the person. How mean is miss Cordwain with forty thousand pounds! what narrow notions! what selfish passions! how ignorant, how contemptible!â€” All the advantages her large fortune procures her, is a title and a coronet: honours how despicable, when such as miss Cordwain wear them!
               Let me thank Heaven then, that made my father a younger brother; that he inherited the

virtues and elevated sentiments of his noble an-cestors, and wanted that allurement to upstart wealth, which might have given me a miss Cordwain for a mother, and have deprived me of those generous precepts, and those bright examples, by which I have been taught to think poverty a less evil than dishonour; and that a peaceful conscience is cheaply purchased with the loss of every worldly advantage.
               These were her reflections, as she afterwards declared to her friend. It is not therefore sur-prising that with such sentiments, our fair heroine found herself tranquil in her humble station, and dignified misfortune by her graceful resignation to it.
               If the woman she served had had judgment enough to distinguish merit, and goodness e-nough to love it, Henrietta must have en-gaged her attention and her kindness: but little minds like nothing but what resembles them-selves.
               Miss Cordwain sometimes condescended to enter into a conversation with her woman, but was quickly disgusted with the difference of their notions; and what she could not compre-hend, she either despised as folly, or suspected as artifice.
               
                  
They were upon these terms when Mr. Cord-wain acquainted his daughter, that they were invited to spend a week at the earl of â€”'s country-seat; for the contested ten thousand pounds being granted by the citizen, the treaty of marriage was renewed; and this visit was proposed in order to bring the young people to-gether again with some kind of decorum.
               Miss Cordwain, in high spirits, gave her wo-man notice to make preparations for this little journey; which done, Henrietta went to take leave of her faithful Mrs. Willis.
               "What a triumph would mine be," said she to her friend,
if any of my relations should happen to be at this nobleman's seatâ–ª and be-hold me in the character of miss Cordwain's servant!
               
               "You have done right, my dear," replied Mrs. Willis,
to call it a triumph; for so in-deed it would be, the triumph of virtue over pride and prejudice.
               
               The good woman informed her, that her guardian was in a very ill state of health, and was gone to Montpelier, in consequence of his physician's advice: that the young man had been there to wait upon her; and that when he heard of the resolution she had taken, he af-fected to think himself extremely injured by her

conduct, as it shewed the utmost contempt of his advice and friendship; but it was easy to perceive, added Mrs. Willis, that there was more grief than anger in the reproaches he threw out against you upon this occasion. He seemed much mortified at my refusing to tell him where you was, but owned that his wife made him very uneasy upon your account; and when I urged that as an argument against the propriety of your seeing him, his silence acknow-ledged me in the right.
               Henrietta was sensibly affected with the news of her guardian's illness; and, since his return was now uncertain, she resolved to write to him immediately, and give him an account of all that had happened to her since he went abroad, fearing that unless she explained the reasons of her conduct, he might be prejudiced against her by her aunt's representations of it. She would not give him any disquiet, by mentioning his son's behaviour, but left that to be unravell'd by time.
               Mrs. Willis having promised to get this letter safely transmitted to Mr. Bale, Henrietta took a tender leave of her, and returned home.
               The next morning very early, the coach and six was at the door; miss Cordwain impatiently stepped in, for she thought every moment an

age till she saw her noble lover again. Her face dressed in smiles of pleasing expectation, and her heart exulting with the consciousness of her own worth, which, by her father's concession of the disputed thousands, had received such a con-siderable addition: but being, as I have before observed, not very happy in the frame of her temper, this sun-shine of satisfaction was soon clouded at being obliged to wait a few minutes for her father, whose slowness but ill suited with her eager impatience.
               Indeed the wary citizen, having wisely con-sidered that they had a journey to perform of at least twenty miles, was busied in packing up some necessary refreshments, that they might not be famished by the way. For this purpose he had caused a neat's tongue, a cake of gin-ger-bread, two or three pounds of almonds and raisins, and a bottle of sack, to be provided; and he himself brought the basket in which they were deposited to the coach, directing Hen-rietta to get in first, that he might place it safely in her lap; which done, he took his seat next his daughter, and ordered the coachman to drive.
               Miss Cordwain's ill humour insensibly wear-ing off, they pursued their journey with great

satisfaction, not having baited above three or four times on the road.
               At length the young lady's eyes were de-lighted with the prospect of the magnificent villa, which she expected one day to be mistress of; but her attention was soon called off that object by the presence of her lover, who, being just returned from a little excursion on horse-back, alighted as soon as he saw the coach stop, and advanced to hand his mistress out.
               The young lord presented his hand to miss Cordwain with an air of forced gallantry; but happening to glance his eyes towards Henrietta, he started back in great surprise.
               Miss Cordwain, vexed at the attention with which he gazed upon her woman, jumped out of the coach, before he had sufficiently reco-vered himself to be able to offer her again the hand, which, in his confusion, he had with-drawn.
               The lady having on a capuchin, which she had wore during the journey, untied it, and, tossing it into the coach to Henrietta, bid her, in an imperious tone, to take care of it.
               This action and these words gave the young nobleman to understand that our beauteous he-roine was actually the servant of miss Cordwain:

a circumstance which furnished him with new matter for wonder; and indeed this encounter gave him so much perplexity, and so entirely engrossed his thoughts, that the old tradesman (who enquired after my good lord and my good lady's health, with as many bows and scrapes as would have served any trader to express his acknowledgment to a customer whom he had just imposed upon) was obliged to repeat his questions several times before he could procure an answer.
               As for Henrietta, she had, upon the first fight of this young nobleman, whom she im-mediately knew to be the same person who lodged at Mrs. Eccles's, been under some con-fusion, left he should accost her as an acquaint-ance before the lady on whom she attended; but observing that from miss Cordwain's be-haviour, he understood her situation, and took no further notice of her than by a side glance, which he gave her, full of passionate concern, she was relieved from her fears, and, far from being discomposed at the character she appeared in, she acquitted herself of the little duties of her station with the most graceful ease; gave her lady her fan, received her commands, and, with a little French trunk in her hand that con-tained

some laces and linen, followed her to the house at a respectful distance.
               Lord Bâ€”'s emotions at this unexpected meeting with Henrietta, having now in some degree subsided, he entertained his mistress as they walked with his usual vivacity and polite-ness, but could not help often turning to snatch a look of her fair attendant, whose charms in that humble station, a station so unworthy of her birth and shining merit, acquired a pathe-tick power that melted him to a tenderness he had never known before.
               He conducted the lady and her father to the apartment of the countess his mother; and, taking the first opportunity to leave them, re-tired to his own, that he might be at liberty to reflect upon his adventure.
               To know that the woman, whom all his most diligent enquiries for so many weeks could never discover, was in the same house with him, was a circumstance that afforded him infinite satisfaction; but he saw no probabi-lity of turning this circumstance to the ad-vantage of his designs upon her. For, with what face could he plead his passion to one of her delicacy, while he was publickly addressing another?
               
                  
The servile condition he saw her in was a bar to his hopes. She who, with such un-common attractions, could resolve to be poor, must needs be incorruptible. What allure-ment could riches throw out for a woman, who knew no other pride but the pride of virtue?
               He could not hope to make an impression upon her heart by the disguise of honourable love. She must needs know the terms he was upon with miss Cordwain; and was afraid that she already despised him for the meanness of such a choice.
               It was indeed still in his power to throw such obstacles in the way of this match, as to defer, if not break it entirely, but he could not resolve to make such a sacrifice to love; he would have married Henrietta with 
                     
                   miss Cordwain's fortune, and was amazed at the violence of his passion, when he considered the prodigious disproportion between twenty and forty thousand poundsâ€” Yet most sincerely did he wish his generosity could have been put to this trial; and, in the violence of his gri
                     â€¢â€¢
                   at the apparent impossibility that this should ever happen, a thousand times did he curse the male-volence of fate, that united so many virtues and

graces in one lovely woman, and denied her wealth; which however, by his preference of miss Cordwain, he tacitly acknowledged was worth them all.
               A whole hour's labour of thought and reflec-tion, left lord Bâ€”'s mind in the same state of anxious doubt and solicitude it was in when he first entered upon this examination of his own heart; and all he could be certain of, in this confusion of ideas and opposing sentiments, was, that the unexpected sight of miss Courteney had charmed him more than ever; and following the impulse of his passion, without knowing whither it would conduct him, or what it would terminate in, he anxiously lay in wait for some opportunity of speaking to her in private, which he found when he least expected it.
            
            
               

               CHAP. VII.
               
                  In which our heroine again appears very foolish.
               
               MEAN time our lovely heroine, who had been received by the countess's woman with prodigious ceremony, and had, during a whole hour, listened with smiling attention to all the impertinences she uttered, was at length relieved from the fatigue of such a conversation, and, with a profusion of compliments, con-ducted to a chamber contiguous to that of her mistress. As soon as she was left alone, she began to consider how she should extricate her-self from the difficulties her unexpected meeting with lord Bâ€” had involved her in.
               Her delicacy was shocked at the thoughts of remaining in the house with a man who had made an attempt upon her honour, especially in the situation she now was; a situation that would seem to invite his future attacks: and, though he might well impute their meeting to the fantastick effects of chance, yet he would not fail to construe her stay into a tacit encou-ragement of that passion he had professed for

her at parting, the dishonourable purport of which was evident from the engagements he had entered into with miss Cordwain.
               She reflected also on the censures under which her character laboured at present, and was justly apprehensive, that when this part of her story was known, the malicious world would not fail to insinuate that she threw herself into lord Bâ€”'s way, and the inferences that would be drawn from such a supposed conduct, must needs be highly disadvantageous to her.
               But, on the other hand, how could she quit miss Cordwain's service so abruptly, without giving occasion for strange conjectures, and set-ting the tongue of malice loose to assign rea-sons for her behaviour, very different from the truth?
               However, the inconveniencies, which might attend this step, were light, compared with those she foresaw from exposing herself volun-tarily to the pursuits of a young libertine, whose eyes in this last interview had spoke too plainly to leave her in doubt of his sentiments.
               She therefore resolved to go away the next day; and, as soon as she was summoned to the toilet, acquainted miss Cordwain with her in-tention.
               
                  
Henrietta was a scrupulous observer of truth, and would not on this occasion violate it, by forming any plausible excuse for her sudden de-termination; so that miss Cordwain, in whose breast the stings of jealousy had been rouzed by the passionate glances lord Bâ€” had darted at her maid, began to entertain strange suspicions from so unexpected an overture; and, in a per-emptory tone, demanded to know her reasons for quitting her service in such a manner.
               Henrietta, with great sweetness, assured her that she did not desire to be dismissed in conse-quence of any discontent, but that the necessity of her affairs obliged her to return immediately to town.
               "Your affairs!" said miss Cordwain, with a haughty sneer;
I vow it is mighty pretty to hear servants talk of their affairs, as if they really had any concerns of more consequence than the duty they owe their principals. I wonder you don't tell me you have half a dozen engagements in town,
pursued she, laughing aloud;
such a speech would become you mightily: but prithee, go, creature; pack up your rags in a sheet of brown paper, and take yourself away. I suppose you have found out a new method of living, less mor-tifying to your pride of beggarly gentility tha
                        â€¢
                     
                     

waiting upon a woman of fortune; and I doubt not but you will be shortly seen flaunt-ing it in publick places with a flimsy sack, a painted face, and all the trappings of your trade.
               
               To this coarse abuse Henrietta listened in silence, beholding her imperious mistress all the time with such a calm, but steady eye, as called up a blush in those cheeks which had been before overspread with a livid paleness.
               Not that she felt any remorse for the re-proaches she had uttered, or was ashamed of her indecent transports, but Henrietta's soft compo-sure, the dignity of her silence, and the ener-getick expression in her eyes, struck a kind of awe into her mean-soul'd adversary; and, inly raging at the inferiority she was conscious of, she commanded her to be gone from her pre-sence.
               Henrietta instantly obeyed, and, meeting the countess's woman as she went out of the room, she begged her to send a servant to the nearest inn to hire a post-chaise for her, being resolved to return to London that very day.
               This well-bred Abigail expressed great con-cern that she was so soon to lose the honour of her company; and asked, with an appearance of anxiety, if she was not to return again?
               
                  
Henrietta replied in the negative, at which the other seemed wonderfully surprised, though she was not ignorant of all that had passed be-tween Henrietta and her lady; for, hearing miss Cordwain's voice very loud, she had applied her ear to the key-hole, and needed no further information.
               Our fair heroine having evaded the artful questions of this prying woman, and discou-raged her reflections on her own lady, whom, in her general invective against the pride and ca-price of mistresses, she did not sp
                     â€¢
                  re, told her, she would have the pleasure of viewing the fine gardens that belonged to the house, before she went away; and Mrs. Supple promised to join her, as soon as she had executed the commission she was charged with.
               Henrietta accordingly repaired to the gardens, full of reflections upon the scene that had lately passed. She entered a little covered alley that led to a grotto, which she had an inclination to take a view of; when, hearing the sound of steps behind her, she looked back, supposing it was Mrs. Supple; but was not a little surprised to find it was lord Bâ€”, who, seeing her cross the terrace from his chamber-window, had followed her thither.
               
                  
Henrietta, rightly judging that this encounter was not meerly accidental, turned her steps from the grotto, and struck into a less private walk. Lord Bâ€”, perceiving her intention, crossed immediately and met her, bowing pro-foundly low, and, with an air as respectful as if he was accosting a duchess, enquired after her health.
               Henrietta, not at all flattered by this instance of respect, which he, by whom it was paid, con-sidered as an act of supererogation, and that it would affect her accordingly, returned his com-pliment with the most graceful ease; and, smiling, told him, he must not now consider her as miss Courteney, but the servant of miss Cord-wain.
               "O that horrid appellation!" cried he;
What violence did I not do myself to behave to you as I did this morning! But tell me, for Heaven's sake, madam, what has occa-sioned this transformation?
               
               "My aunt's continued displeasure," replied Henrietta;
your lordship has perhaps heard what circumstances my father died in: the station therefore in which you see me, ought not to be called a transformation; it is what I was born to, since I was born in in-digence.
               
               
                  
"I cannot bear to hear you talk thus," inter-rupted lord Bâ€”;
how could you think of subjecting yourself to a condition so unworthy of you, when you knew there was a man in the world that would have died to serve you!
               
               "I am not of a temper," said Henrietta,
to be easy under great obligations; and servitude is, in my opinion, less shocking than depen-dence.
               
               "Why, do you talk of obligations," said lord Bâ€”:
love knows no property; could you doubt that my fortune would be at your com-mand. Suffer me, I conjure you,
pursued he,
to snatch you from this unworthy situa-tion; can riches be better employed, than in supporting her I love?
               
               "My lord," interrupted Henrietta, her face glowing with indignation,
this is an insult I could not have expected from one of your rank and politeness: I am fallen very low, indeed, when a man, who is upon the point of marriage with another, d

               "There are certain engagements," replied lord Bâ€”, a little confused at the air with which she uttered these words, "in which the "heart has no part.

"Very likely," interrupted Henrietta;
but it is sufficient for me to know, that the en-gagements your lordship has entered into, leaves you not the liberty of addressing me in this manner: and I look upon the professions you make me as the highest insult upon my distress.
               
               Lord Bâ€”, notwithstanding he found in this justifiable haughtiness the ruin of his hopes, could not help admiring a mind so rightly turned; humble with such propriety, and proud only, when condescension would be meanness.
               "This is not a time," said he,
to tell you how far I am bound by those engagements you speak of; but, whatever they are, they ought not to deprive me of the happiness of doing you service.
               
               "I am obliged to you, my lord," said Hen-rietta;
but, at present, the greatest service you can do me is to take no notice of me.
               
               In speaking these words, she courtesied, and would have left him; but he, not able to part with her thus, snatched her hand.
               "You must not leave me," said he,
till you promise to give me an opportunity of speaking to you more fullyâ€”Ah, how I love you!
cried he, gazing on her passionately.
               
                  
"Again, this insulting declaration!" inter-rupted Henrietta, pulling her hand from him, and giving him a look full of scorn and anger, as she turned away.
               "Hear me, madam," cried he, pursuing her:
suffer me, in the character of your friend, to offer you my services. My mother was for-merly acquainted with lady Meadows: if it will be of any use to you, I will engage her to renew it, and offer her mediation betwixt your aunt and you. You must not, b

                      heaven you must not, continue longer in so shocking a situation.
               
               This proposal, and the earnest manner in which it was made, drew Henrietta's attention: angry as she was, she thought it merited a civil return.
               "Doubt not my lord," said she, her charm-ing eyes recovering their usual sweetness,
that I should be glad to consider you in the cha-racter of a friend; and the offer you now make me is so obliging, that I cannot dispense with myself from telling you my reasons for declin-ing it.
               
               She then, in a few words, acquainted him with the purport of her aunt's letter to her "Such are the terms," added she,

be only effected; therefore the countess's in-terposition in my favour, were she disposed to grant it, would be of no use.
               
               Lord Bâ€”, having before fully informed himself of every thing relating to miss Courteney, no sooner heard that for so trifling a compliance as the change of her religion it was in her power to secure lady Meadows' estate to herself, which he knew to be very considerable, than he thought fit to alter his style, and declared that the affair between miss Cordwain and him was not carried so far to take from him the liberty of following his inclinations, and of offering her his hand; be begged her therefore to favour him with another

                  My lord, this can never be: there are many obstacles against it; you will find it very difficult to surmount those your own family will throw in your way; but, suppose that could be done, my scruples will raise others less easy perhaps to be overcome.
               
               She left him when she had said these few

                  ords, and went to meet Mrs. Supple, who

told her she had procured a vehicle for her, and that it would be at the back-gate in less than an hour; but, continued she, there is a strange confusion within, have you seen your lady?
               Henrietta told her she had not.
               "God knows what is the matter," said Mrs. Supple;
she went into the garden to look for you as I imagined, and returned 
                        
                      mi-nutes ago with a most wrathful countenance: her father and she confabulated together, and then went into my lord's dressing-room; and Mr. Harris, my lord's gentleman, told me that the old man seemed to be very

               Henrietta had no time to make any reflections upon what she heard; for a servant that moment came to tell Mrs. Supple, that her lady had sent him to look for her, and desired that she would bring miss Cordwain's woman to her apart-ment.
               Henrietta, though a little surprised, followed Mrs. Supple with great chearfulness, who de-sired her to wait in the anti-chamber, while she went to acquaint her lady with her being there; where we will leave her for a few moments till the reader is informed of the accident that occasioned this summons.

                  Which contains a curious dialogue between the earl and the citizen.
               
               MISS Cordwain, who in the notice lord Bâ€” took of Henrietta, found matter sufficient for jealousy and uneasiness, entertained the most injurious suspicions, when she heard her woman's sudden resolution to return to Lon-don; and having driven her from her presence with a torrent of abusive language, vented her rage in tears as soon as she was gone.
               She reproached herself with her folly, in dis-missing her so readily; when, by obliging her to stay, she might have guessed her designs, or at least have obtained a more certain knowledge of them.
               Her mischievous imagination being now upon the stretch to find some expedient for pro-tracting her departure, at last presented her with one which she resolved to make use of.
               She hid a diamond bracelet; and then rung her bell for Henrietta, with an intention to tell her, that she could not find it, and insist upon her producing it before she left the earl's.
               
                  
Mrs. Supple, who was that moment passing by her apartment, and knew that Henrietta was not in the way, stepped in to know what she wanted. Miss Cordwain asked for her woman, and, being told that she was walking in the garden, hastened thither immediately, not more delighted with the opportunity she now had of putting a stop to her journey, than of affronting her with the suspicion of theft.
               As she descended the terrace, her eyes were blasted with the sight of her woman at a distance in earnest discourse with her lover.
               At this confirmation of her suspicions, she ran back like a fury into the house, and meet-ing her father, who had just left the earl in his dressing-room, told him, that they were invited only to be affronted: that Henrietta was lord Bâ€”'s mistress; that he had taken her out of her service; and that she was going back to London that very night at his request.
               The old man, without staying to enquire farther, or reflecting upon the extreme impro-bability of this story, swore that never a lord in the land should use his daughter ill, and strode back to the earl's apartment, while miss Cordwain retired to her own, meditating vengeance on those that had so cruelly injured her.
               
                  
Mr. Cordwain, who had promised himself to speak to the earl in very high terms, was no sooner in his presence than he sunk into that li
                     â€¢â€¢
                  leness, which meer monied men are so con-scious of, with persons of birth and politeness. However, he assumed courage enough to tell his lordship, that he had something to say to him in private.
               The earl, observing that his features were ruffled, was a little surprised; but dismissed his gentleman immediately, though he was not quite dressed, and then, with a complaisant smile, desired the citizen to let him know his commands.
               "I am a plain man, my lord," said Mr. Cordwain,
I don't understand fine compli-ments and breeding, though I don't want for manners neither; and I am sure I have always been very civil to your lordship; and I did not expect that your lordship would have in-vited my girl and I here to scoff at us. My lord, I can give my girl forty thousand pounds, which is what few lords can say, let me tell you that; and withal I am an honest man, tho' I have forty thousand pounds more in my pocket perhaps: but no matter for that I am not proud of my riches.
               
               
                  
"Mr. Cordwain," said his lordship (wonder-ing to what this eloquent harrangue tended)
I hope nothing has happened to give you any disgust; upon my honour, I have the highest esteem for you, and I think I give a proof of it, by being so desirous of your alliance; but I am at a loss to comprehend your meaning, when you talk of my having invited you and your daughter here to affront you. Miss Cordwain is a most accomplished young lady, and my son has too much judgment not to be as sensible as he ought of her merits.
               
               "Indeed," interrupted Mr. Cordwain,
my daughter is in my eye a very comely young woman; and I will never give her to any man, though he were a duke or a prince, that would keep a mistress under her nose, a
                        â€¢
                      one may say.
               
               "You astonish me, Mr. Cordwain," replied his lordship;
have you any reason to suspect that my son is a libertine?
               
               "My lord," returned Mr. Cordwain,
I am no scholar, I don't understand hard wor
                        â€¢â€¢
                     ; I have had learning enough to scrape a few thou-sands together, and that is sufficient for meâ–ª Your lordship's son may be a libertine for what I can tell, that's neither here nor there

but I am sure he is a terrible rake: and what tender father,
pursued he, almost in tears,
would marry his child to a rake, to have all the fruits of his toil and labour, for thirty years and upwards, squandered away upon leud women?
               
               "Sure! Mr. Cordwain," interrupted his lordship, with a sterner accent,
you do not imagine my son capable of acting so dishonour-ably, his principles, Mr. Cordwain â€”
               
               "Nay, nay, my lord," resumed the citizen,
I have nothing to say against his principles; he is no Jacobite, I dare engage: but he is a rake, my lord, that is my objection to him, and rakes are very bad husbands.
               
               "My son," said the peer,
may have had some youthful follies; but I am sure miss Cordwain's beauty and good sense will fix his heart.
               
               
                  And does your lordship really think my girl a beauty?
said the fond father, his eyes glisten-ing with pleasure.
Indeed I always thought so; but fathers, my lord, are apt to be partial.
               
               "She is both beautiful and witty," replied his lordship, who found every excellence in fifty thousand pounds.
               "Nay, as for her wit," said Mr. Cordwain,
I am the best judge of that, who have seen

her growing up under my eye. She took her learning surprisingly, my lord, and by that time she was ten years old, she and read her Psalter quite through. Would it not grieve one then (continued he) to part with such a girl as this to one that will slight her, and keep mistresses?
               
               "Do me the favour, Mr. Cordwain." said his lordship,
to acquaint me with your rea-sons for suspecting that my son will keep a mistress, though he should be so happy as to have miss Cordwain for a wife?
               
               "Why, you must know, my lord" replied the citizen, looking extremely wiseâ–ª
                  that I have made a discovery; and yo
                        â€¢â€¢
                      son is ac-tually carrying on an intrigue with my daugh-ter's maid.
               
               "Sure this must be some mistake," cried the peer.
               "No, no, my lord," answered Cordwain, "it is no mistake, I am very sure of it."
               
                  And you have discovered this intrigue, you say,
resumed his lordship: "pray when, "and by what means, did you discover it?
               "About half an hour ago," replied Mr. Cord-wain; "my daughter told me of it."
               
                  

            HENRIETTA. BOOK THE THIRD.
            
               CHAP. I.
               
                  In which our heroine meets with a new disappoint-ment, and some farther instances of miss Woodby's friendship.
               
               HENRIETTA, being now left to her own reflections, beheld her late conduct in a light in which it had never appeared to her before; the sense of blame so justly in-curred, filled her with remorse and shame. Hitherto she had industriously aggravated the cause of her fears, that she might not stand self-condemned; which to an ingenuous mind is of all others the greatest evil: but Mrs. Willis had stated her case too justly.
               What force could give her unwilling hand to the old baronet? How could she be cheated into

                  Oh! then it was your daughter that disco-vered it,
said his lordship, smiling a little at the old man's absurdity.
               "Ay, ay, my lord," cried he, construing that smile into an acknowledgment of his daughter's sagacity.
I told your lordship she did not want for wit.
               
               
                  But miss Cordwain is certainly mistaken now,
said the peer;
this is some pretty frowardness, a love-quarrel; depend upon it we shall find it so: however, I will talk to my son, and I'll engage the countess to dis-course your daughter upon this matter. Come, Mr. Cordwain, we who are the parents of these young people know their true interest better than they do, and must endeavour to make up this little breach between them. I will make an end of dressing,
pursued his lordship, bowing low to the cit,
and join you in the garden a quarter of an hour hence, when I hope to clear up this affair to your sa-tisfaction.
               
               Mr. Cordwain immediately withdrew; and the peer having stepped to his lady's apartment to acquaint her with this strange story, left it to her to manage miss Cordwain, and went in quest of his son, who, when Henrietta left him, had retired to his study, and was revolving in

his mind a scheme, which, by reconciling his interest to his love, would gratify all his wishes.
            
            
               CHAP. IX.
               
                  In which Henrietta has an interview with the countess.
               
               THE countess, like a discreet matron, was resolved to see the young woman, of whom miss Cordwain entertained a jealousy, that she might by wholesome counsels fortify her against seduction; for she supposed that this suspicion took its rise from the girl's being pretty, and perhaps some little unmeaning gallantry of her son's, who, like all other young men, admired beauty whenever he found it.
               She was willing also to know certainly whe-ther miss Cordwain's fears were only imaginary, that she might the better effect a reconciliation between the lovers; for she passionately desired the completion of a match that would put her son into possession of forty thousand pounds.
               When Mrs. Supple appeared in consequence of her summons, and told her that Mrs. Hen-rietta waited her ladyship's commands, the coun-tess

asked her what sort of a young woman she was?
               Mrs. Supple replied, that she was an aukward sort of a body, mightily conceited of her beauty she believed; and Heaven knows, added she, she has not much to boast of.
               "Well; tell her to come in," said the coun-tess, beginning to believe, from this account of her, that miss Cordwain's fears were not without foundation; for vanity, she well knew, was the great underminer of chastity, from the duchess down to the chamber-maid.
               When Henrietta entered the room, the coun-tess, who expected to see a very different person, was so struck with her beauty and the dignity of her air, that she rose from her seat, and returned the graceful courtesy she made her with a com-plaisance that surprised her own woman, who, being ordered by her lady to leave the room, in-stantly obeyed, but went no farther than the door, where she stood listening, and heard all that passed.
               "You appear to me," said the countess to Henrietta, with an engaging smile,
to deserve so little the suspicions that are entertained of you, that I really know not how to mention them to you, though it was for that purpose I sent for you hither.
               
               
                  
Henrietta was a little surprised at this begin-ning; but conscious of the integrity of all her actions, she was wholly free from any appre-hensions that could discompose her.
               
                  I know not, madam (said she) the nature of those suspicions which I have incurred, but I am very sure I have no guilt to reproach my-self with, which should make me fear to stand the strictest scrutiny.
               
               "Upon my word I believe you," said the countess, charmed with the noble confidence of her answer, and the graceful manner in which it was delivered;
and it must be my son's im-prudence that has given occasion for Mr. Cordwain's suspicions.
               
               The countess was too delicate to make use of miss Cordwain's name upon this occasion; but Henrietta in an instant comprehended the whole mystery, and was now able to account for the injurious language that lady had given her.
               "Own freely to me," pursued the countess, smiling,
has not my son been a little trouble-some to you, and talked to you of love and such idle stuff?
               
               "It is some mortification to me, madam," replied Henrietta, blushing,
to own that I have been affronted in the manner your lady-ship mentions: however it is certainly true,

lord Bâ€” has thought me weak enough to be dazzled with his professions.
               
               "Then you have seen my son often," said the countess.
               Henrietta, who thought it behoved her to be very explicit on this occasion, related to the countess the manner of her becoming acquainted with lord Bâ€”, his concealing himself in her chamber, and his behaviour afterwards.
               "I did not know his lordship's name," pur-sued she;
and though I often heard him men-tioned at Mr. Cordwain's, yet as I had no reason to suspect that he was the same young nobleman, whom I had such reason to avoid, I made no scruple to attend miss Cordwain hither.
               
               "I am very much concerned," said the coun-tess,
to hear this account of my son; it was a very shocking attempt. So you have acquainted your mistress with what happened?
               
               "No, madam," answered Henrietta,
that was not necessary; but when I discovered that lord Bâ€” was the person who had treated me so freely, I desired miss Cordwain to dismiss me, because I did not chuse to throw myself in his way.
               
               
                  
"That was very prudently resolved," said the countess;
and when are you to leave miss Cordwain?
               
               "Immediately, madam," replied Henrietta;
I have provided myself with a post-chaise to return to London, and I believe it is now waiting for me.
               
               "Certainly!" said the countess (after a little pause)
this sudden resolution of your's must surprise miss Cordwain. What did she say when you acquainted her with it?
               
               "She was extremely angry, madam," replied Henrietta,
and said many severe things to me, at which I was then astonished; but it 
                        
                      Cordwain entertained any unfavourable sus-picions of me, her behaviour may be ac-counted for.
               
               "Since you have not acquainted her," said the countess,
with my son's rude attempt upon you, what reason could she have to sus-pect you?
               
               "I know of none, madam," answered Hen-rietta,
except his lordship's speaking to me in the garden a little time ago, may have come to her knowledge.
               
               
                  You have shewn so much candor in your answers to my questions,
resumed the coun-tess,
that I am persuaded you will tell me

frankly the subject of my son's discourse to you in the garden.
               
               "I was born to suffer indignities, madam," said Henrietta, her cheeks glowing with indigna-tion:
My lord Bâ€”, though he must know that I was not ignorant of his honourable pas-sion for miss Cordwain, yet dared to affront me with the mention of his love.
               
               The countess was a little surprised at this sally, which escaped Henrietta in the warmth of her resentment, when she recalled to her re-membrance a declaration, which she looked on as the highest insult, since lord Bâ€” was ac-quainted with her birth. Had the countess known that it was the niece of the earl ofâ€”, who expressed herself in such lofty terms, she would have admired that becoming pride, which suggested them; but in the waiting-maid of miss Cordwain, it appeared absurd and ridiculous, and she was ready to suspect her of artifice and dissimulation.
               But when she cast her eyes upon Henrietta, and saw the emotion with which she was agi-tated, the deep blush that glowed on her cheeks, and the tears that trembled in her eyes, she re-proached herself with the injustice she was guilty of, in so soon admitting doubts of her inno-cence.
               
                  
Henrietta, supposing from the silence of the countess, that she had no more to say to her, courtisied to her respectfully, and was about to withdraw.
               "You must not go," said that lady, in an obliging accent,
till I know whether it is in my power to serve you. You have thrown up miss Cordwain's service upon my son's ac-count, it is but just therefore that I should procure you another; if you are not provided for, I will recommend you to my sister, she will either take you herself, or settle you with another lady.
               
               The countess, in making this offer, had an-other view besides serving Henrietta. She was not willing to lose sight of her, for she rightly judged that with so many charms in her person, and an understanding far above what we gene-rally found in persons of her rank, this young woman was very likely to inspire a solid pas-sion; and she dreaded lest her son should be so far captivated by her as to neglect the advanta-geous match that was now offered him.
               If she placed her with her sister, or with any of her friends, it would not be easy, she thought, for her son to get access to her; or if he resolved to continue his pursuit, his designs, whatever

they were, would be known soon enough to be prevented.
               Henrietta penetrated no further into the coun-tess's sentiments, than what served to give her a high idea of her benevolence. She accepted her offer with expressions of the deepest gratitude; and this the lady considering as a proof of her sincerity and right intentions, she, in the billet which she gave her for her sister, recommended her in very obliging terms to her favour.
               Henrietta again politely thanked her, and, receiving the billet, upon which there was a full direction, she went out of the countess's chamber, with an intention to depart immediately.
               Mrs. Supple, whom she found in the anti-chamber, informed, her, that her chaise was waiting for her at the gate; upon which Hen-rietta took leave of her, and descended the back-stairs, but was suddenly stopped by Mr. Cord-wain, who had followed her, and, seizing her rudely by the arm, charged her with having robbed his daughter.
            
            
               

               CHAP. X.
               
                  Contains a discovery which it is hoped the reader will not be displeased with.
               
               "GOOD Heaven!" exclaimed Henrietta, in the utmost astonishment,
what can this mean?
               
               "Look you child," said the citizen,
my daughter tells me you have stole her diamond bracelet: any body but myself would send you to prison directly; but I am tender-hearted, and consider, that though I could hang you for this robbery, yet that would be poor satis-faction for such a loss: therefore in compas-sion I will spare your life, provided you imme-diately restore the bracelet.
               
               Henrietta had by this time collected her scat-tered spirits, and comprehended the motive of this malicious accusation.
               "May I not see miss Cordwain, sir?" said she, in a composed accent;
I am 
                        
                      that I can convince her she wrongs are greatly by this strange suspicion.
               
               "See her! what should you see her for?" re-plied the old man,
unless you will give me

a convent, when she was forewarned of the de-sign? From her obstinate opposition to her aunt's will, nothing worse could have hap-pened than the loss of her favour and protec-tion, which by her flight she had anticipated. She now wondered at the unreasona
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  ness of her fears, and looked back with the deepest re-gret upon the errors they had occasioned
               These melancholy thoughts, and her anxiety about the reception her aunt would give her, kept her waking almost the whole night. As soon as it was light, she rose, and dressed her-self, impatient to be gone; Mrs. Willis at her summons made haste to join her, and, when they had breakfasted, set out immediately upon their journey; Henrietta full of perturbation and enquietude, Mrs. Willis with that 
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  ity which attends the consciousness of doing what is right.
               The young lady, as she drew nearer her aunt's dwelling, found her emotions increase; one while her imagination represented lady Meadows as kind and indulgent, ready to forgive her error, and to restore her to her affection; and, imme-diately after, she would tremble with the ap-prehension of her severe reproaches.
               Mrs. Willis perceived her unea
                     â€¢â€¢
                  ness, and used her utmost endeavours to compose 
                     
                  
                  

back the bracelet: you must not think to move her with your whining; her intreaties shall not save you if you are obstinate; so look to it: but come, perhaps you will have the grace to repent, and return the bracelet; come along.
               
               Saying this, he pulled her up stairs, and led her, with no great complaisance, into his daugh-ter's chamber, who sat exulting in her successful mischief, and the disgrace she had fixed upon the creature that presumed to rival her: a blush how-ever dyed her cheeks at the sight of Henrietta, who, with a look that at once expressed the highest contempt of her mean accuser, and calm confidence in her own untainted innocence, asked her how she had so far offended her as to make her seek her life?
               "Offended me, creature!" said miss Cord-wain;
have you the assurance to imagine that I am uneasy becauseâ€”becauseâ€”You vain saucy flirtâ€”who told you that I could be jealous of you? And so you supposeâ€”but you shall produce my bracelet.
               
               "Ay, that she shall," cried the citizen;
I wish we were in town, I would carry her be-fore alderman Grey-goose immediately. Come, girl, don't be a fool, but deliver up the bracelet, for this is a hanging matter, let me tell you.
               
               
                  
"Do you really propose, madam?" said Hen-rietta, looking on miss Cordwain with a most contemptuous smile,
to go through with this malicious accusation? and are you resolved to perjure yourself, and swear that I have got your bracelet?
               
               "What does the creature mean!" interrupted miss Cordwain, colouring.
               "My meaning is," said Henrietta,
that your bracelet is certainly in your own posses-sion; and that you pretend to have lost it only to fix a scandal upon me.
               
               "O my God!" cried miss Cordwain, putting her hand to her head;
the excessive insolence of this wench affects me so, I believe I shall faintâ€”Dear papa, let her go about her busi-ness, I had rather lose ten bracelets than suffer so much uneasiness. Dear sir, let her go, one time or other she will meet with her de-serts. She will not stop at this theft, but somebody else may bring her to justice; I will have nothing more to do with her.
               
               "Base woman!" cried Henrietta, almost choaked with rage.
No, I will not take the liberty you offer me: has our laws, think you, no punishment for a calumny like this, that strikes at life as well as reputation? You shall be forced to prove your charge, and

my fame shall be cleared to your everlasting confusion.
               
               Miss Cordwain, conscious of her guilt, and apprehensive of the consequences of what she had done, knew not what answer to make to this menace. As for the citizen, he stared with stupid wonder upon the injured fair one: for the extraordinary emotion she was in, gave such ve-hemence to her utterance, and such fire to her eyes, that he even trembled, as if in the presence of some superior being. But poor Henrietta, after this sudden sally of rage, found her heart so oppressed with the indignity she had suffered, that she burst into a violent passion of tears.
               Miss Cordwain was ready to renew her insults; when she found her so mortified, and her father being recovered from his pannick, again urged her to restore the bracelet; when a servant came in, and informed them, that dinner was going to be served, and that his lord and lady expected them in the dining-room.
               Miss Cordwain immediately obeyed the sum-mons, for she dreaded the conclusion of this affair. When she entered the room, the coun-tess, who knew nothing of what had happened, seeing her look very pale, asked her, if she was well? and lord Bâ€”, who had pro-mised his father to cure her jealousy by redoubled

assiduity for the future, approached, and, with a well counterfeited tenderness, expressed his con-cern for her indisposition.
               Miss Cordwain, who had been assured by her father that the earl earnestly desired the match between his son and her should go forward, re-solved not to protract it by any shew of resent-ment at what was past, and therefore received his little assiduities with all the complaisance she was mistress of; but desirous of mortifying him in the person of her who had so greatly attracted his notice, as well as to give him an opinion of the softness of her disposition, she told him, that indeed she was prodigiously discomposedâ–ª that her maid had robbed her; "and my father," added she,
threatens the poor wretch with a prosecu-tion, and I was weak enough to be excessively shocked with her blubbering.
               
               "Has your maid robbed you, miss?" said the countess, extremely surprised.
               
                  She has stolen a diamond bracelet from me this very morning, madam,
replied miss Cord-wain.
               "Impossible!" cried lord Bâ€”, in a tran-sport that deprived him of all consideration;
miss Courteney could not be guilty of any thing mean or scandalous.
               
               
                  
These words were scarce uttered, when he discovered and repented of his indiscretion; but it was now too late to repair it.
               "Miss Courteney!" repeated miss Cordwain, recovering from her surprise;
who is miss Courteney, my lord?
               
               The countess, perceiving her son was embar-rassed, endeavoured to relieve him, by asking miss Cordwain some questions concerning her loss; but that young lady would not be diverted from her question.
               
                  This creature has a variety of names, I suppose (said she): she hired herself to me by the name of Benson, and Courteney it seems is that she has been formerly known by. Sure I have been very unfortunate to get such a wretch to attend me.
               
               "Madam," said lord Bâ€”, again thrown off his guard by his indignation at hearing a wo-man of Henrietta's merit so grosly abused,
you don't know who you are speaking of?
               
               "Why, do you know?" said the earl to his son, in an accent that shewed how extremely he was displeased with his imprudence.
               
                  Yes, my lord (replied he) I do; and ma-dam,
pursued he, addressing himself to miss Cordwain,
I am sure you will have candor enough to excuse my engaging with some

warmth in the defence of the unfortunate young lady, who is now your servantâ–ª when you shall know that she is the niece of the earl ofâ€”; and that it is her firm attach-ment to the religion she was brought up in, which hinders her from succeeding to a very large estate, and makes it necessary for her to go to service for a subsistence.
               
               This account brought tears into the eyes of the countess, who inly applauded herself for her discernment in the favourable sentiments she con-ceived for Henrietta before she knew who she was.
               The earl appeared moved, and was begin-ning to ask his son some questions concern-ing this fair unfortunate, when miss Cord-wain fetched a deep sigh, and fell back in her chair.
               Rage at this discovery of her rival's birth and extraordinary merit, and terror, left the scan-dalous accusation she had forged against her, should end in her own disgrace, operated so powerfully upon her spirits, that she fainted away.
               While the countess supported her, lord Bâ€” rang the bell very deliberately for assistance; and the earl, not much concerned at an accident, which he imputed to a jealousy that proved her

passion for his son, took that opportunity to re-mind him that it was his interest to improve the affection this young woman had for him.
               The countess, who had in vain searched her pockets for a smelling-bottle, ordered a servant, who appeared at the summons of the bell, to bring one off her toilet; when Mr. Cordwain entered the room, and, seeing his daughter in that condition, made but one step from the door to the place where she sat, exclaiming,
Oh! my child, what ails my child? is she dead?
               
               "Don't be alarmed," said the countess,
it is only a fainting fit, she will recover pre-sently.
               
               Lord Bâ€”, who was ashamed to appear wholly inactive upon this occasion before his designed father-in-law, had presence of mind enough to take a decanter of water from the side-board, and sprinkle some of it on miss Cord-wain's face.
               This remedy was applied so successfully, that she immediately opened her eyes, but the first object they met had like to have closed them again: for her father, hearing a smelling-bottle called for, remembered that she always carried one or two about her, and, searching her pockets with trembling haste, pulled out, with a smell-ing-bottle, the bracelet which she had concealed

there, as a place where it was likely to be most secure, being subject to no search but her own.
               The old man made none of those reflections upon this accident, which were obvious enough to every one else; but, perceiving his daughter was beginning to recover, presented the brace-let, instead of the smelling-bottle to her, con-ceiving the former to be the best restorative.
               "See, child!" cried he, in a transport,
I have found your braceletâ€”come, you must be well nowâ€”I don't wonder you was grieved: truly it would have been a great loss.
               
               Miss Cordwain flattered herself from the words I have found your bracelet, that her father had had wit enough to save her from any reproach, by giving some favourable turn to the discovery; but in this she greatly over-rated his abilities.
               "And where dost think I found it, child:" pursued the old man:
even in thy own pocket, as all the company can witness.
               
               "Very true;" said lord Bâ€”, malici-ously.
               "Was it found in my pocket?" said miss Cordwain.
Why then, to be sure, I pulled it off with my glove this morning, and forgot it: I protest I am sorry there has been so much noise made about it.
               
               
                  
"It is a pity indeed," said the countess,
con-sidering who the person is that was supposed to have stolen it.
               
               "O la! papa," cried miss Cordwain,
you don't know that my maid Henrietta is disco-vered to be a great lady. Upon my word it is true,
pursued she, seeing him look sur-prised.
               "I am sorry to hear that," said the citizen, rubbing his forehead;
for if she has friends who will support her, she may commence a suit against me for Scandalum Magnatum, and what a power of money may I loseâ€”See what comes of your heedlessness, girl. I pro-test I don't know what to do.
               
               The countess, though she was vexed at the vulgar sarcasm of the daughter, was nevertheless desirous of freeing the old man from his uneasi-ness, as well as to have an excuse for visiting the injured young lady.
               
                  I am persuaded (said she) that miss Cour-teney's delicacy will prevent her from seeking any publick reparation for the affront she has suffered; but I will see her myself, and, if ne-cessary, dissuade her from taking any resolution to your prejudice.
               
               Lord Bâ€”, who was talking to his father at distant window, hearing this proposal, ap-proached,

and, by a look which he gave the countess his mother, seemed to bespeak her ut-most tenderness and complaisance to the afflicted fair one.
               Mr. Cordwain thanked her 
                     
                   for her kindness. "But, Odso! madam." 
                     
                  , stopping her as she was 
                     
                  
                  I 
                        
                      your ladyship's pardon, you must take the key up with you,
continued he, 
                     â€¢â€¢â€¢
                  eling in his pockets, and at last pulling it out;
for when I came down, I locked the door for fear the bird should fly away.
With these words, he gave the countess the key, smiling and nod-ding his head in applause of his own sagacity.
               The countess was extremely shocked to hear of this new indignity which the poor young lady had suffered, but she dissembled her concern, and silently withdrew.
               Lord Bâ€” again stole to a window to hide his emotions; and the earl, though greatly dis-gusted with the behaviour of both father and daughter, yet approached them with a complai-sant air, and congratulated the 
                     
                   on the re-covery of her jewel.
               Thus did these noble persons accommodate themselves to the manners of those whom they in secret despised; and, for the sake of a few paltry
