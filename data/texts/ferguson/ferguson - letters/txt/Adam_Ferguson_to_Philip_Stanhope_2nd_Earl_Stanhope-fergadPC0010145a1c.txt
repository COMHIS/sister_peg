Edinburgh March 10th 1777

My Lord

I took the Liberty, in the end of January last, to write a letter to The Earl of Chesterfield, in which I enclosed a Copy of your Lordships letter to me dated at Paris Aprile 6th 1774. And Observed that the terms of that letter being conditional it was necessary for me to apply to His Lordship on the Subject. And referred him to Mr James Chalmer of St. Albans Street London who woud receive his Commands, being entrusted with My  letter to his Lordship & my Other Affairs at London. Mr Chalmers Called upon Lord Chesterfield several times, left my letter together with one from himself, waited some weeks for an Answer, & has since at my desire communicated his Bussiness to Mr Lovel Stanhope who has declined taking any concern [in] it. So that having no expectations of an Answer to my Applications from The Earl of Chesterfield I am under the dissagreeable necessity of stating the fruitless attempts I have made, and of referring the whole matter to your Lordship that some better way may be devised for comeing at the knowledge of Lord Chesterfields mind. I transmit this letter by Mr Chalmer that in case appearances be more favourable that they were when he wrote me last he may not trouble your Lordship with it.

I received last Summer by Mr Clow at  Glasgow A Copy of Mr Simsons Postumous works which he told me your Lordship did me the honour to order for me & I beg that you will now tho so late accept of my Acknowledgements.

I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most obliged 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
