Argyle Square Tuesday Evening 28 June 
1785



My Dear Sir

I find the Doctors or their Patients defer our excursion to Pennicuick sine die. And of this I think necessary to send this notice to Milton house that in case you be in Town the mere desire of giving us your Company should not carry you out of your way & give us the Mortification of missing you as well as Pennycuik in this fine weather.

I am Dear Sir 
your most Affectionate 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
