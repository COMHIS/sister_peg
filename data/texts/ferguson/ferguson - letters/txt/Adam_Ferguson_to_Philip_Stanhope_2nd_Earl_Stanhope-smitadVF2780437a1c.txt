Edinburgh, 7 April 1777

My Lord

I have some posts ago had the honour of your Lordships Answer to my letter of the 10th of March. And am not surprised that Lord Chesterfield shoud forget particulars to which it is probable that he gave very little attention. My Annuity never was mentioned in any conversation I ever had with His Lordship. But from what dropped from others about the time of our separation I imagine that the Subject was then understood. Mr St Germain in particular told me, that on his expressing some Reluctance at Supplanting me[,] Lord Chesterfield to remove his Scruples said that I was to have my Annuity and to return to My Professorship, which it was likely I woud prefer to going abroad. I have taken the Liberty to communicate to Mr Chalmer your Lordships letter that he may know of Lord Chesterfields message to your Lordships man of business. And have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
Your Lordships 
most obliged 
and most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
