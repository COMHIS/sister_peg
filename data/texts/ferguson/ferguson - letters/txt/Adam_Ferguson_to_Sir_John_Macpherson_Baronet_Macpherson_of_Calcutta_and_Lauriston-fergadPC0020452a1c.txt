My Dear Friend

I have just now received your Letter in the same cover with our Seamans dispatch & experience in every thing your kind attention to my requests.

My Answer to your last was delayed by Accidents but I hope will have reached you before this. You will there see our sense of your good offices & may perceive the joy with which we avail ourselves of them. It occurred to me that you might wish without loss of time to have the young mans Name Viz. James Ferguson. But his age I did not think of. He was born in the year 1778 of course is now turned of twenty but not twenty one which I hope is still within the Age at which Cadets are taken into the Service; if it should  exceed the Age of Admission we shall be woefully dissappointed As we have all agreed to prefer the Cadetship you mention even to an immediate gift of a first Commission in the Kings Service. I write merely to Convey this information of our name and Age & Shall not detain my Letter for any Other matter whatever. Believe me to be

My Dear Friend 
most Affectionately yours 
Adam Ferguson
