Hallyards near Peebles Janry 19th 1808

you call upon me to declare how I stand affected to the sale of my Palace in Rose Court. I persist in the purpose to sell it and a Purchaser may have possession at Whitsunday next. It would be [in] present circumstances very convenient to me to have it turned into cash.

Adam is threatened with a remove to far distant parts in his rank of Subaltern & presses for aid to buy Promotion. We are Straining every Nerve for that purpose. I believe I told you  the Price I sett upon the foresaid Palace was Â£500. I shall be glad to know your Resolution soon as the time of letting approaches when we must determine what is to be done for a year to come.

You should have told me how your Father holds out. He is to me the principal Figure in the Picture.

I am nevertheless with great affection to all My Dear Sir 
your most obedt & most h. 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
