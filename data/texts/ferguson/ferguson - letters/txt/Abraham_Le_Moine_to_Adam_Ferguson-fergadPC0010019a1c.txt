Groningen October 19, 1756

Sir

I received your letter yesterday; I am very sorry your passage to the Lemmer has been so tedious, & hope it has been Speedier to Amsterdam.

As to Mr Fletcher he has taken your departure better than I expected, his melancholy has in a great measure left him, he begins to talk & to be conversable. He begun yesterday with the fencing Master, what I have adviced him to do, by way of exercise; in Short, I think, you & his relations may be very easy about him. & you may depend upon the promise I made you, not to be wanting in any thing that can procure him pleasure ease & contentement. Wishing you a good passage to Harwich I remain

Sir Your most humble & 
obedient Servant 
A. Le Moine





My Spouse desires to be remember'd 
to you 
you may depend upon Secrecy
