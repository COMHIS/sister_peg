As we whose Bones are burried here 
Have seen The Works of God 
So ye living in your Turn 
Behold them an[d] rejoice 
The Light is glorious 
And if Understood 
Will more than Recompence the Pains 
you feel. While in this Nursery 
of Intellectual Being 
your Follies are 
with Stripes 
Even we whose Bones 
are buried in this Ground 
Have been Spectators of the Earth 
and Heavens. Ye Living in your 
Turn behold them & rejoice 
The Sight is glorious and if Understood 
will more than recompence the Pangs 
you feel: while in this Nursery of 
Intellectual Beings your Follies 
[are repre]ssed with Stripes.
