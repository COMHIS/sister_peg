My Dear Friend

I went into the Case  drawn up by your Friends at London, as soon as I received it, And very highly esteem their [xxx] part only in it, as well as the Ground That was laid for them, And attempted to write to you immediately; sed ter cecidere manus . I should be sorry to break upon that confidence in Mankind & in Justice which has been a Characteristic of you[r] life. At the same time I wished to guard you against the wounds of Dissappointment in this Appeal to Justice, and Candour. What we have to dread is no[t] a direct negative to our Claims, but the delays which Insidious malice may  still procure & with a more cruel Effect than any immediate decision could have. These were topics on which I could easily say too much and on which after I had written I wished to retract. In short, I applaud your confidence in all worthy men: but would join with al[l] indifference to those who are Otherwise. When Alexander saw Diogenes he felt immediately that next to Conquering the World that was the very part he should Act. Here is a Tub more roomy than that of Diogenes and it would be joyous for me to see you every moment of My Life.

You mention a letter of Sir John Dalling* but did not inclose it. If it be material that Fordyce should see it: please send it to him.

I am My Dear Friend 
your most affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
