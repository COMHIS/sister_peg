Munich 5 Octr 
1793



My Dear Friend

Here I am at Munich in a most prosperous course of travelling waxing in Strength and Patience. I sent you a line from Frankfort intimating my intention of sending your Letter to the Marquis Lucchesini with my regret for not being able to hunt for Military Quarters in Person. I did so in the best french I could muster.

The Elector of Bavaria said at his Levee yesterday that the King of Prussia had declared his Intention to winter at Berlin & to leave his Army under the Duke of Brunswig. There is I find a hankering inclination to Censure his Majesty on a Supposition that more might have been done in the Campaign but I am of the opinion which I guess is also yours that to hem in the French and give them as few opportunities as possible to take what we call crop to themselves is the very Perfection of Conduct. There is a Report here that The Emperor is about setting out  for Brussels & that even part of his Equipage is in readiness.

I surprised James Stuart by meeting him here & find we shall be much together at Rome &c. It is now about forty years since I have known him to be one of the pleasantest Naive and best hearted Creatures in the World. I am introduced to Mr Walpole here & was a vraie diner D. Ambassadeur, all English at his house yesterday: but I shall make no Stay being very impatient to get within the Precincts of the Old Republick & no less impatient to be at some place where I can hope to hear from you & learn something of what is doing in the World for in this Way of Life we are hoodwinked and know no more than can be seen when the glasses of the Sulky are down. I am

My Dear Friend 
your most 
Affectionately
