[23 Sept. 1795]

 Nydpath Castle to Pendreech health peace & Salubrity. Retired from the Children of men to live among the lambs of Sheep & their Shepherds, I am anxious to know what is passing among the Dogs & the Wolves. And if the Wolves come across the flock, rejoice that they are dogfully opposed. There is malice in your old friend. The Don's cession of St Domingo to the French, with whom both he & we were at War; but with how little hearty Cooperation! The Don will never forgive Gibraltar & who can blame him. I have sometimes asked Jn Bull how he would like to have Spain lay hold of the Lands End, and pretend to give law in the British & Irish Channels. But Jn thinks that Other Nations should give way to him. He is insulated and at one time thinks he should care for nobody, at another time that every body should be governed by him & never at all knows how to behave himself to Other Nations. But according to the Italian Proverb: Bisogna ben coprirsi il viso innanzi di  stuzzicar il vespaio .

I am glad the Armament is great and may the Blessed Maker of Seas & Winds and Climate favour its unwieldy Bulk. It is not long since I thought R. Abercrombie the first of the young men in point of of Good Sense Gentleness and Candour. How proc[e]ed to See him with the Thunder on his Arm. So the Lord of Thunder & of Storms preserve and Prosper him. That is right by all means bring home the Cavalry they will enable Such politicians as I am to Sleep the Sounder. I knew the Strain would be tedious: for I had such a one myself: but time will restore the Muscle & may it be really, as well as nominally, that of Achilles, till peace is restored which is the never ceasing Object of My Prayers &c &c &c
