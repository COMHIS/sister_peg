Dear Sir

Above you have a Certificate which I hope will entitle you to receive my half years appointment from Lord Chesterfields Banker. You will recollect the Bussiness on which I have lately been at London. It was so far advanced at my Departure that I left my Son Joseph Ferguson possessed of an Appointment of Cadet in the Corps of Artillery on the Bengale Establishment and  of an Order to Captain Dempster of the [xxx] to give him his Passage to India. I left him in the hands of Captain Dempster & of some Friends in the City for this purpose paying all Costs for Passage & Necessarys on the Voyage or on his arrival. But in case any trifle should remain from oversights, delay or Other Accident I left with him a letter to you requesting that you would be so good as Supply him to  my Account, & I now renew the same request. I am Dear Sir

your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
