Sir

I know well how much I might rely on General Campbells kindness: but as I have been at some pains to bring matters to this point would rather borrow afterwards than not pay now So shall be glad to see you on Monday Evening as you propose.

I am Sir 
your most Obed.t 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
