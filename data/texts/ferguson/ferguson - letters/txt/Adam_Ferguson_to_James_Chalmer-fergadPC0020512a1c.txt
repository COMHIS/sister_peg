St Andrews October 2d 1809

My Dear Sir

you will learn on the Other leaf of this Paper that I have changed Quarters Since my Last. Grown too feeble for Country affairs I supposed a Town would fit me better And having out Lived all my Friends at Edinburgh I endeavour to mix here with a Society that is very much to my mind And shall be glad to hear of you on every Occasion.

Dear Sir your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
