Edinburgh Aprile 12th 
1777



My Lord

I have agreeably to your Lordships desire signified to me by Mr Smith enclosed with this a Copy of your Lordships letter to me dated at Paris Aprile 6th 1774. And am sorry that for weighty reasons mentioned to Mr Smith & which if desired he will communicate I am not at liberty to send the Original. At the same time Mr Chalmer  My Agent at London will receive Copys of that & of two other letters from your Lordship to me compared and attested by a Notary Public & by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Of which with your Lordships permission he will make the necessary use. If My Lord Chesterfield declare that on having these Copys verifyed by a Comparison with the originals he will perform the Condition that is to Relieve your Lordship of the Obligation contained in that which is dated at Paris Aprile 6th 1774 I will go to London & if he give me leave will wait upon His Lordship with the Original of that Letter. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most obliged 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson









To Earl Stanhope
