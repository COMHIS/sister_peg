Edinburgh Septr 10th 1759

Dear Sr

I am sorry to be Obliged to give you trouble a second time about my Affairs in the College: In treating about the Instruments which belonged to the Late Doctor Stuart I have been referred to Doctor Cuming who has engaged to bring that Affair to some conclusion by tomorrow. As there are likewise some Instruments which belong to the public, I am obliged to give you the trouble of making an application to My Lord Provost & Town Council, to have those instruments delivered to me by their Authority, together with Such an Inventory as may Ascertain the particulars committed to my care, & for which I or my heirs are hereafter to be accountable to the public.

I am Sr 
With great Respect 
your most obedient & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
