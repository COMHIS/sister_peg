Dear Sir

you may believe that Since I received your intimation of a desire to be lodged for the winter Somewhere in this Side of the Town I have not neglected to inquire if there was any Sort of House to be had. I have not been very Successful: but am this Moment told that Mrs Betty Johnstones house in what we call the Society very near hear is to be left furnished. It is a Storey in a Land. The Rooms are a Dining Room Small drawing Room two bed Chambers & a Kitchen as I am told very well furnished. The Neighbours that is to Say the People over head are too two Old Women who neither Spin nor make any noise whatever. I have made no inquiry about the Rent but shall if you desire it. John Home has been returned to Edr sometime and is  gone Again for a few Days to burry his Father in Law Mr Home at Foggo uncertain when he may return. The Old horse Arrived safe upon his own Legs. And when it is a tolerable day I almost repent having returned your chaise so faithfully. But winter is now so much in earnest with us that it is likely I shall not drive any more before Lady Day. Who is here but General Clerk. My Infirmities absolutely prevent my trotting after him or meeting him any where except when he calls for a little here: but I hope for a compleat set down from him before he goes away. Send me your Orders if you have any about the House it is possible you may have been in it perhaps to see John Johnstone who used to be there with his Sister. I am Dear Sir your most Affectionate

& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
