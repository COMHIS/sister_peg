Sr

Lord Chesterfield hav[in]g Com[m]unicated to us a Joint Letter from Lord Stanhope Sr George Saville and Mr Hewitt dated the 3rd Inst, acquainting his Lordship that they found themselves under such difficulties and Embarrassments in the Execution of the Trust in which they were engaged as reduced them to the necessity of resigning the office of his Guardns. and desiring his Lordship to make choice in their stead of such other p[er]sons as might appear to him more useful than was in their power, his Lordship applied to us to accept the care of his person during the Short time of his Minority, w[hi]ch we have accepted and finding Mr de Saint Germain (a Gent[leman] who Travelled with Lord George Cavendish) had been thot. of by Sr George to accompany Lord Chesterfield in his future Tour Abroad and finding that Mr de Saint Germain is a proper p[e]rson for that Employmt. we have engaged him from the 24th Instant from w[hi]ch time your attendance on his Lordship seems to be unnecessary. Mr Stanhope acquainted you of this on Tuesday last, the day after Lord Chesterfield applied to us but as you have expressed a desire that we shod. ratifye it in writing we now do it and are Sr. Your Obedt. Servts.
