My Dear Sir

I hope you mean to be here today at Dinner. Andrew Stuart is in Town & if he should not be engaged I will try to make him meet you if not we cannot help it. Mr Pulteney continued last night in the resolution of departing this morning.

I am Dear Sir 
most affectionately 
yours Adam Ferguson
