Blackheath 22d April 1782

Dear Sir

At my return from Bath on Saturday evening I found it necessary that I should stay a week or two about London before I go to Scotland & chuse to pass as much of that time at this place for the sake benefit of the Air, as I can. As this is about the time that Lord Chesterfields people of Bussiness may be expected to make their half yearly Payment you will please to let me know what passes. Direct for me at Mrs Atkinss near the Hare & Billet on Blackheath. The penny post I am told is the best conveyance hither.

I am your most Obedient humble Servant

 
Adam Ferguson
