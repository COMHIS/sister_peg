Chevening, 28 October 1777

Sir

I have received the favour of your letter of the 23rd. inst. wherein are these words concerning Lord Chesterfield. ‘In a line which he wrote me from his Inn he mentioned his having acted improperly in the affair of my annuity, and afterwards told me that he meant to do all that the Law enabled him to do which was to bind himself for his own life and for mine in case he survived me.’

His binding himself for your life if he survives you, I cannot understand. Whatever the sense of it may be I do not perceive how I and my Heirs would be exonerated, as we ought in equity to be, in case you survive him. It seems plain to me that if Lord Chesterfield cannot charge his real Estates for a longer term than his own life, he may easily with the money he can command purchase for you an annuity of £200 a year for your life certain, and so free me from all engagements to you in every possible case.

My wife and my Son desire their compliments to you.

I am with great truth and esteem, 
Sir 
Your most faithful 
humble Servant
