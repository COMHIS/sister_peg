Edinburgh 20th Octr 1783

Dear Sir

you may possibly think that I am forgetting you like your Other Correspondents of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; but Michaelmas must remind me. I knew exactly the State of your bussiness on receiving your Letter: but our Society very unlike a trading Company that has Stopt Payment has never yet begun to pay & when they do I hope will never Stop.

They have had only one meeting for the first Forms & they have established a Fund for their expence but how productive it has yet become I know not.

The Person for you to correspond with  I believe is Mr Keith younger of Ravelstone at Edr who has accepted the Office of Treasurer. The Society is to meet for Bussiness on the first Monday of Novr. It will be proper that your Account be then presented & you will either transmit it to Mr Keith in time for that purpose, or if you have formerly sent it to any person here cause them produce it, tho I think it should bear interest & therefore a fresh Copy will be best.

Be so good as make the usual Call on Lord Chesterfield's Agents.

I am Dr Sir 
your most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
