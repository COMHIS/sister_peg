Chapel Street friday 17th May 1799

Dear Sir

I am about my departure for the Country. I wish to make some presents here but now recollect only Sir Ralph Abercrombie Lord Dalkeith Lord Ancram & Mr Kerr of the Post Office to whom we are so much Obliged. When the Vols are Stitched be so good as send Copies to these three Four Persons, Directed to each from the Author. You will learn at what Shop Lord Dalkeiths & Lord Ancrams parcels are taken in & they have Messengers every day in Town. I imagine I shall not trouble you for many more here but if any should occur to yourself or me I may trouble you hereafter. I am Dear Sir

your most Obedt 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
