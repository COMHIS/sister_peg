My Lord

The State of my health having, for some time past, made it desireable for me to have a retreat from my labours in the College, I now resign my office of Professor of Moral Philosophy into the hands of your Lordship & the Town Council, presenting at the same time my sincere thanks for the honour, which has been done me and the protection I have always received.

I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most obliged & most 
obedient humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson











To James Hunter Blair Esqr 
Lord Provost of Edinburgh
