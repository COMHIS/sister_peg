Mr Goldie Principal of the College of Edinburgh who is come to a great Age is I am informed taken Ill & considered as dying. That place is at the Disposal of the Town Council. And in case of a Vacancy The person who appears fittest to me for the Office is Mr Adam Ferguson at present Professor of Natural Philosophy. His Character is well known to My Lord Bute & his Affection for His Lordship is a great merit with me. He has already given proof of his merit & Abilitys here by contributing in his Station to raise the Reputation of the University since he has been a Member of it & by increasing the number of Students particularly in that branch which he teachs. He has also gained the Affection of the youth and acquired a degree of Esteem & Authority peculiar to himself.
