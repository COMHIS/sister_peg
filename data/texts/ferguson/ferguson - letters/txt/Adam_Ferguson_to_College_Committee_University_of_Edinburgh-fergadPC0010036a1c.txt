Edinburgh August 13th 1759

Sr

I have not yet had access to the Rooms in the College, which are alloted to the use of the Natural Philosophy Class; because some Effects belonging to the executors of the Late Professor are still lodged there, & the Person to whose care they are committed is absent from Town. But being informed that those Rooms need reparation, I am Obliged to beg the favour you will apply to My Lord Provost &  The Town Council in order to have them visited, & the necessary repairs considered, in such time as that they may be compleated if possible before the meeting of College. Mr Cumming with whom I am to treat of what relates to the late incumbent & myself, is expected in Town this week, and that no time may be lost after his Arrival, I beg that you will be pleased to lay this request before the first meeting of Council & am Sir

your most faithful 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
