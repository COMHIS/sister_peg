My Lord

I am now Charged by my Colleagues of this University to Return your Lordship their most Sincere thanks for the mark of your Attention and Esteem which they have received & which they will always think it a happiness to merit.

You will permit me My Lord in Particular to express my sense of the honour you have done me & to offer in excuse of my long silence my not having had an opportunity sooner of communicating your Lordships letter & presenting the Tournaline Stones at a public meeting.

I have made some trials of their force, and there is only one in which I once thought upon being heated with Scalding Water that the Electric power was Sensible. Among the numbers which are picked up in account of their appearances no doubt many must fail. I have the Pleasure to Observe that many of your Lordships Friends in this Countrey are well. And have the honour to be with the greatest Respect My Lord

your Lordships most Obliged & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
