Kensington Gore, 13th January 1781

My Dear Friend,

Though your illness has not filled me with despondency, the first reports I had of it took away the happiness I should naturally have had in announcing to you my India appointment. The truth is, I was so little disposed to mention that event to any of my friends in Scotland — while I understood you were in a situation not to communicate it to them first — that I never wrote to any person here of it; and the only correspondence I have had with your capital of late, is an answer which I thought myself obliged to send to the Duke of Gordon. I have likewise written to the Duchess this night.

Dr Carlyle's letter of to-day has set my mind more at ease. You have naturally a good constitution; and I place every hope in your Highland stamina, your philosophy, and knowledge of nature.

My friend Carlyle has written me, with an interest in your welfare, and all that belongs to you, that adds, if possible, to my attachment to him. There is a circumstance which, with all his love for you and me, he is not fully known to — it is that I met you when I lost my father, and that your children and I are of but one family. — Farewell. May the power of affection be a power to give health and happiness! If you do not recover your health before I leave this country, I leave it with half my spring of satisfaction and soul.

Yours ever

John M'Pherson
