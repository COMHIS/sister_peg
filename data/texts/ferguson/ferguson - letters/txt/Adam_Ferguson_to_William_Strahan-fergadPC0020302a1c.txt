Dear Sir

As our second term of payment is come I have drawn upon you of this Date payable at twenty Days after Date for Â£500. This is the time of Payment which gives me Par here. And I hope that this Advice will find Publick Affairs verging towards some settlement that we may cease to be what I am told we are the derision of Europe. I forgot to Mention that My Bill is to Messrs Mansfield Ramsay & Co. I am Dear Sir with great Regard

your most Obedient humble Servant
