Edinburgh, 23 October 1777

My Lord

I was last night agreeably surprised by the Arrival of Lord Chesterfield at this place. In a line which he wrote me from his Inn he mentioned his having acted improperly in the Affair of my Annuity, And afterwards told me that he meant to do all that the Law enabled him to do which was to bind himself for his own Life and for mine in case he survived me. He likewise gave me his Bankers name that I might draw for Â£200 at Christmas next. I am extremely happy at this change of His Lordships mind and it may save himself from Censure and prevent any farther trouble to your Lordship. Lord Chesterfield had been at York to see his Sister when he took the Resolution to come on here and after staying one night at his Inn in already Gone on his Return to England. I beg leave to trouble your Lordship with my humble Respects to Lady Stanhope and Lord Mahone and Am with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
Your Lordships 
most obliged and 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
