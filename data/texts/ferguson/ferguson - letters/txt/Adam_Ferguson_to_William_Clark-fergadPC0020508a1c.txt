My Dear Sir

As the Tenement in Rose Court will be getting open to your Possession about this time, it was my purpose to be in Edinburgh to finish the Bussiness: but I am not so far recovered from my Spring indisposition as to venture so far from Home. And must refer you to Mesrs Ramsay Bonar & Co who have an ample Factory from me & do every thing for me. They are in possession of the Full Deeds to that little Property & when it is convenient for you to proceed in the transaction will employ to some proper  Person to attend you & when the Disposition is made out it may be sent here for my Signature before Witnesses. Mesrs Ramsay Bonars & Cos Receipt to my Account will be a Sufficient discharge for any Money on My part.

I am with most affectionate respect to your Father and Family

My Dear Sir 
your most Obedient & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson





William Clerk Esqr Advocate
