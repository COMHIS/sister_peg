Edinburgh 22d Septr 1783

Dear Sir

My having been abroad on an excursion for some weeks has delayed my troubling you as you will find I have done by this post. Six months being elapsed on the first Ins't from the Publication of my History of the Roman Republick; I have according to our agreement drawn upon you to Mansfield & Co' at twenty days after date for a thousand pounds.

I mentioned this matter to Mr Creech who thought I should proceed in this manner leaving the partners  to settle this with other particulars of the transaction among themselves.

I am Dear Sir 
with great Regard your most obedient & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson





William Strahan Esqr
