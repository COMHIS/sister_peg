My Lord

I wrote your Lordship a litle before I set out from Groninguen, of the resolution I had taken & did not find any reason to Alter it. Mr Fletcher continued to recover his Spirits, & since I set out I have the Satisfaction of a letter from his Landlord; which came to hand at this place, telling me he was very well, & begun to talk & employ himself more than when I was at Groninguen.

I have come here in order to meet with some company or find out some convenient way of travelling to Scotland & don't intend to make any Stay. I sent your Lordship in my last some computation of Mr Fletchers Stated articles of expence where he now is. I am sorry that this Journey shoud have been so expensive to your Lordship, & earnestly wish  the Satisfaction may be answerable, which I hope it will. The whole according to the best account I have been able to keep of the Particulars amounts to Â£53:2:5. The delays in waiting for Passages has increased the expence a good deal. I hope to be in Scotland soon & defer further Particulars till then. I am My Lord

with great respect 
your Lordships 
most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
