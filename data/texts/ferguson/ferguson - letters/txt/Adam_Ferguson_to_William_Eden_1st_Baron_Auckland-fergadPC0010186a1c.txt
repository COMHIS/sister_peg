Dear Sir

I have just now received The Inclosed from Mr Rivington with Intimation that the whole impression of 200 is cast off & waits the orders of The Commissioners.

I imagine that no use can be made of this printed Copy till the Signed original is posted up & this can't be done till Sir Henry Clintons Subscription is Obtained.

It is of moment that it shoud not be delayed. And if you think so it may be proper to Apply to General Jones or The Commanding Officer here for An  Orderly Non Commissioned Officer to go to Sir Henry Clinton with it in the Jerseys in order to have it Signed. If you think that this can without inconvenience be delayed till monday I hope That I may then be well enough to Undertake that excursion. If you see Lord Carlisle tonight be so good as Settle what is to be done & let me know your Commands. I am

Dear Sir 
your most Respectfull 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
