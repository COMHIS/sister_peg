Hallyards 10th June 1796

My Dear Sir

I doubt both the Grey mare & I will be puzled to repay our Obligations at Boghuan. She never could come to me at a more favourable time, I have pasture for ten or twelve Beasts & am made to expect that I shall cut a thousand Stone of Hay: Such a Stock as yours I know well is apt to overgrow & be felt grievously at a Pinch of Backward Grass, my first impulse was to take away the old mare as soon as possible: but on recollection that, besides her first unexpected Production, she is possibly nursing or to nurse a Second, this may not be proper. I might relieve you of the Colt at any rate if I knew how to have him Conveyed but I am affraid he will neither lead nor Carry. Be so good as order what should be done & if any careful person could be found to lead the little animal here, I would willingly pay Costs. All the above Profusion of Grass is not  at the Castle as you Suppose but at a new post I have just taken having evacuated the Castle. I remained there till near Whitsunday in the same state of uncertainty I mentioned to you about Christmas: The Grounds there were coming to be let, but without any prospect of my being accommodated on any reasonable terms. The neighbouhood of a little Town brought competitors with whom, it would have been very imprudent for me to contend. The Land Lords Passion was for Grassum rather than Rent & tho I offered £707 Grassum & a Rent of £22 for about forty Acres part Rocky & covered by Wood. I took occasion of the Report of a higher offer to withdraw mine & laid hold of this little Settlement at Hallyards upon the Manor on the other Side of the Tweed from Nidpath, where I am accommodated at once as above with a Small House, indeed; but excellent Offices & some fine Pasture of which some small part inclosed. Letters directed to Nidpath will find me but my new direction is at Hallyards By Peebles.

I am My Dear Sir

your most Affectionate & most Humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
