Edinburgh 15 Novr 1782

To His Grace The Duke of Montagu from Dr Ferguson at Edinburgh

A Gentleman in whose ingenuity, the writer of this memorandum has much Confidence, says, that he knows of a method of attack against which Gibraltar is not provided, & by which of course it might be taken by the Enemy. The Defence, if known might defer the event or oblige the besiegers to repeat their attack with disadvantage; but could not in the end prevent the effect of it.

He farther professes to know of means that may be employed to keep vessels afloat, when in danger of sinking at Sea, And which would be effectual to raise the Royal George now sunk at Spithead.

Adam Ferguson
