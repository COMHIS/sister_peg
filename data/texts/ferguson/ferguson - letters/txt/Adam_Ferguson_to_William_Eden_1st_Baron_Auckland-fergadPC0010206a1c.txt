Fludyer Street March 30th 
1779



Dear Sir

I have been much disstressed yesterday & today; confined to My Bedchamber & mostly lying upon the Bed, which hindered my writing upon you for more particular Directions about the appointment you mention. I imagine I shall be able to make all the necessary alterations in Campbell's appointment to Apply to Sir James WrightÂ  but wish to know whether his Name in this Manner will be designation enough. I am now ordered to go into the  Warm Bath, will stop at the office in My Way & endeavour to have the Clerk come to me this afternoon to have the Commission drawn up.

I am with the greatest Respect 
Dear Sir 
your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
