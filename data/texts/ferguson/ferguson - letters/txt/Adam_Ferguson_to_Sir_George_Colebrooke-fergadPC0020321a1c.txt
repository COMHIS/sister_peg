Edinburgh 25 May 1786

Dear Sir

I have received the Favour of your Letter with the Paper which you do me the honour to communicate, in two Packets. Having been for some days in a bustle preparing for a remove to the Country I am Obliged to plead this As an excuse for my delay in complying with your desire of an immediate acknowledgement & hope you will accept of it as such however insufficient.

Dr Gardner is not in Town: but you may rely on my punctuality in what remains of your injunction. When I see Dr Gardner you may expect to hear from me, & tho you may observe that my notions agree with  yours in the main point & that I am even ashamed of having appeared to mistake it in any instance: yet there is perhaps some difference in respect to the Principle on which the Intollerance of the Antient Nations you mention & that on which which modern Nations proceed. May not such a difference be inferred from the meaning of terms now of great import[ance] but without any corresponding meaning in Other times. Such as Infidel contradistinguished to the Faithful or true Believer &c. The Error inconsistent with, or the Creed that is necessary to Salvation. The Zeal for Prosylitism. The detection refutation or suppression of Heresy. The Canon of Orthodoxy &c &c. If you find besides mere expressions of horror & vengeance against Profaneness, any conceptions of the understanding that correspond to the meaning of the terms recited. I must endeavour  to correct my present notions on the Subject. And here I shall leave the Matter having gone farther than I meant in this hasty acknowledgement of your Favour and of the sincere Respect with which I have the Honour to be Dear Sir

your Most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
