Argyle Square 2d October 1783

Dear Sir

I must insist on not seeing the inclosed any more & that may matters may proceed for this year in the ordinary way. I wish that I were a great Prince with a great Revenue & fewer outlets for money that I might deal more nearly in proportion to what I think of Peoples merits. In the mean time I am your most

Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson





P. S. I had attended Dr Ferguson's the first year he taught the Natural Philosophy Class, 1759— 60, gratis . . . . two years after, when in Watson's hospital, I offered him a fee, but he would not accept it. When his son Adam came to my class in the H[igh] S[chool] I requested he would allow me to return his favour; but next year when I sent back his first quarter, I received this letter.
