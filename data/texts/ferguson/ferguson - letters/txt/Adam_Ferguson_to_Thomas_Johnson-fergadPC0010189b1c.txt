Copy

Sir,

I am by Command of their Excellencies His Majesty's Commissioners to inform you that having issued a Manifesto and Proclamation of which the inclosed are Copies, they did without delay direct Packets as in the inclosed list to be carried by an Officer with a Flag of Truce to Annapolis in the Province of Maryland; but having reason to believe that those Packets have not been delivered at the Place of their Destination; they think it their Duty in a Matter of such High Concern to direct a few Copies to you by a different Conveyance in order that you and the People of Maryland may know the Contents of said Proclamation.

And the more fully to enable all whom it may concern to avail themselves of the Gracious Intentions of His Majesty and of Parliament. I am farther commanded by their excellencies to inform you that the Original Instruments executed in due Form shall be sent as soon as your desire or that of the People of Maryland is signified to that Effect.

I am Sir with all due Respect your most obedient and most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
