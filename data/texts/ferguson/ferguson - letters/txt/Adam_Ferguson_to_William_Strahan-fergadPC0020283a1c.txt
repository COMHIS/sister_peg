Edinburgh 4th July 1782

Dear Sir

I am much obliged to you for your Admonitions both general & particular, as you may see from the use I make of them. The danger is that I change too much. Hitherto I hope that the Number of Types or Letters is not much changed but be so good as tell me when I am likely to tresspass too far. My manner of writing exposes me to this need of correction to the last moment; The first draft is always made very rapidly in order to overtake the matter which is likely to escape me. In this work my Object was to state the Subject. & I thought simplicity the greatest beauty of Stile. If I could attain to Purity as well as perspicuity all would be well. In this I hope you will continue your Assistance. When I come before the Publick I shall hope for Indulgence. But the time to indulge me in any thing I can correct is not yet come.

The Death of our Worthy Friend Dr Blair is to me a very real Affliction. The Effect of it to his young Family will continue to be Felt. By one letter in which it is mentioned, he is said to have died Suddenly; but I have not yet got any particulars. My Complts to Mr Strahan & to Mr Cadel when you see him.

I am 
Dear Sir your most Obedient & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson





Willm Strahan Esqr
