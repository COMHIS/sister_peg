We whose Bones are buried here 
have trod like you this stage of Earth 
And seen these these works of God 
That reach from Earth to Heaven 
The Sight is glorious behold it 
And rejoice. If understood it will 
more than recompence the Ills you 
Suffer while in this Nursery of 
Intellectual Being, of which you form 
a Part your Malice & your other 
Childish Follies are repressed with 
Stripes. Mean Well to your fellow 
Creatures & be diligent. Occasions 
will not be wanting for your best 
Affections nor [xxx] to urge your 
Faculties & call forth your Strength 
The Scene extends beyond your 
Sight seek not to descry it Never 
died Infant in the Parents Womb 
anticipate the Light of Day in which 
he was to Act his Part of of Manhood, 
yours is yet to come beyond the 
Precincts of this Parent Sphere.
