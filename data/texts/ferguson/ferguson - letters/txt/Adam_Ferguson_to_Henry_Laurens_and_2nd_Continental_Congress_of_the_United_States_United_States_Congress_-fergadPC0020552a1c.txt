Letter to the President and Other Members of Congress, His Excellency Henry Laurens the President, and other Members of Congress.

Gentlemen

With an earnest desire to stop the further Effusion of Blood and the Calamities of War, We communicate to you with the least possible delay after our Arrival in this City, a copy of the Commission with which His Majesty is pleased to honor Us, as also the Acts of Parliament on which it is founded, and, at the same time that We assure you of our most earnest desire to reestablish on the Basis of equal freedom and mutual safety the Tranquillity of this once happy Empire; you will observe that we are vested with Powers equal to the Purpose and such as are even unprecedented in the Annals of our History.

In the present State of our Affairs, though fraught with subject of mutual Regret, all parties may draw some degree of Consolation and even Auspicious Hope from the recollection that cordial Reconciliation and Affection have in our own and other Empires succeeded to Contentious and Temporary Divisions not less violent than those We now experience.

We wish not to recall Subjects which are now no longer in Controversy, and will reserve to a proper time of discussion, both the hopes of mutual Benefit and the Consideration of Evils that may naturally contribute to determine your Resolutions as well as our own on this important occasion.

The Acts of Parliament which we transmit to you having passed with singular Unanimity, will sufficiently evince, the disposition of Great Britain, and shew that the Terms of Agreement in Contemplation with His Majesty and with Parliament are such as come up to every wish that North-America either in the hour of temperate Deliberation or of the utmost Apprehension of danger to Liberty has ever expressed.

More effectually to demonstrate Our good Intentions we think proper to declare even in this Our first Communication that We are disposed to Concur in every satisfactory and just arrangement towards the following among other Purposes.

To consent to a Cessation of Hostilities both by Sea and Land.

To Restore free Intercourse, to revive mutual affection, and renew the common Benefits of Naturalization through several parts of this Empire.

To extend every Freedom to Trade that our Respective Interests can require.

To agree that no military Forces shall be kept up in the different States of North America without the consent of the General Congress or particular Assemblys.

To concur in measures calculated to discharge the Debts of America, and to raise the Credit and Value of the Paper Circulation.

To perpetuate Our Union by a Reciprocal Deputation of an Agent or Agents from the different States who shall have the Priviledge of a Seat and Voice in the Parliament of Great Britain or if sent from Britain in that case to have a Seat and Voice in the Assembly's of the different States to which they may be deputed in order to Attend in the several interests of those by whom they are deputed.

In short to establish the Power of the Respective Legislatures in each particular State, to settle its Revenue, its Civil and Military Establishments, and to Exercise a perfect freedom of Legislation and Internal Government, so that the British States throughout North-America acting with us in Peace and War under one Common Sovereign may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every Priviledge that is short of a total Separation of Interests, or consistent with that Union of Force on which the Safety of our common Religion and Liberty depends.

In our Anxiety for preserving those Sacred and essential Interests, We cannot help taking notice of the Insidious Interposition of a Power, which has from the first Settlement of the Colonies been actuated with Enmity to us both. And notwithstanding the pretended date or present form of the French Offers to North-America yet it is notorious that these were made in Consequence of the Plans of Accommodation previously concerted in Great Britain, and with a View to prevent our Reconciliation and to prolong this Destructive War.

But we trust that the Inhabitants of North-America connected with us by the nearest Ties of Consanguinity, speaking the same language, interested in the preservation of similar Institutions, remembering the former happy Intercourse of good Offices and forgetting recent animosities will shrink from the thought of becoming an Accession of force to our late mutual Enemies; and will prefer a firm & free and perpetual Coalition with the Parent State to an insincere and unnatural Foreign Alliance.

This Dispatch will be delivered to you by Doctor Ferguson the Secretary to His Majesty's Commission and for fuller explanation and discussion of every Subject of difference, We desire to meet with you either Collectively or by Deputation, at New York, Philadelphia, York Town or such other place as you may propose. We think it right however to Apprise you, that His Majesty's Instructions as well as our own desire to remove from the immediate Seat of War in the Active Operations of which we cannot take any part, may induce us speedily to remove to New York; but the Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Land Forces (who is joined with Us in the Commission) will if it should become necessary either Concur with us in a Suspension of Hostilities or will furnish all necessary Passports and safe Conduct to Facilitate our meeting and we shall of course expect the same of you: If after the time that may be necessary to consider this Communication and transmit your answer the Horrors and Devastations of War should continue we call God and the World to Witness that the Evils which must follow are not to be imputed to Great Britain. And we cannot without the most real Sorrow anticipate the Prospect of Calamities which we feel the most Ardent desire to prevent. We are with perfect respect

Gentlemen your most Obedient and most humble Servants
