My Dear Friend

I have written by this Post to the Lord Advocate in order to bind myself in obligations for whatever he may do at your request. He has many qualitys fitting him to be a considerable Man, Temper, Perseverance, Resolution. And, what is of most consequence is felt by his friends as a Man who will not desert them nor trifle with his connextion. He has likewise shown a disposition to carry the opinion of Respectable People along with him and as Matters now stand if he does not appear to run to[o] fast may securely outstrip his competitors.

This Town has been long thought of consequence, my opinion is that the way to gain it is not to make direct applications here but to show the  possession of power and consideration at London.

If your Riots are not over my nostrum is suspending the Habeas Corpus act that Idle people And Madmen may be laid up till the Sober. The law is slow and will not make effectual examples. Military execution in the streets would be dreadful and would introduce only the start of order that prevails at Constantinople; the consequence of systematic or repeated riots near the vitals of Government are such that I think the Habeas Corpus should be suspended as often as a Riot is continued or repeated after 24 hours. But this not appearing to wiser heads makes me doubt of the propriety of it.

yours affectly 
Adam Ferguson
