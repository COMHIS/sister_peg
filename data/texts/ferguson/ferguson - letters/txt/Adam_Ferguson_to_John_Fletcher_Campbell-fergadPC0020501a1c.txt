Hallyards near Peebles 27 October 1806

My Dear Sir

Here is yet another Letter. Since yesterday I have an unexpected Account of Debts to be payed for my Son which allarms me much, And the relief you have been so good as Offer will be most Acceptable.

If your Agent pay to Mansfield Ramsay and Co and send me their receipt to My Account, I shall still with the little Strength I have left be able to Surmount My Difficulties.

This from your &c &c 
Adam Ferguson



To John Fletcher Campbell Esqr
