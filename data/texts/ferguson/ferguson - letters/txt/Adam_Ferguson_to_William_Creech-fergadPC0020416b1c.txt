Hallyards 5 July 1797

Gentlemn

you may remember I took from you when last in Edr Count Rumfords 6th Essay of which the Title is Of The Management of Fire & Oeconomy of Fuel. This is bound separately but is intended as part of a Second Vol. You will therefore now please send me the preceeding five Essays forming Vol. 1st, And all the Subsequent Essays except the 6th which I have already got as soon as they come out whether separate or in a Vol. If the 7th Essay is come to hand please send it now by the [xxx] Carrier & along with The first Vol. The Carriers name is Steel, he puts up at one Patersons the Sign of Harrow in the Candlemaker Row & leaves Edr on Friday morning. Direct your Parcels to me at Hallyards by Peebles.

I am your most humble Servant
