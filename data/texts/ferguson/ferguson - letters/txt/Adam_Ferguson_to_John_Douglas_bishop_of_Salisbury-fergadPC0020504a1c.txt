Hallyards near Peebles N.B. March 4th 1807

My Lord

I have to remind Your lordship in this letter of two different Persons. The writer of it will sett his name at the end, and has no other Claim to Credit; but for mer[e] instances of Your Lordships Goodness. The Other Person for whom he ventures to address your Lordship is Mr William Gardiner, who was some years ago admitted to Holy Orders, with a view to his becoming Chaplin to the English residing at Dantzick, where he has accordingly been with great satisfaction to himself & those with whom he was connected; Untill the Calamitous Defeat of the Prussians & the Advance of a Victorious Enemy whose threats of Destruction to every thing English on his Way, will account for Mr Gardiners Allarm & Escape to his own Country, where he has come with a Wife, and six Children. He now proposes to offer himself  at home, and hopes for a kind reception in the Bosom of that Church to which he belongs.

I was one of the persons who formerly bore Testimony to his merits and am far from having any reason to repeat the concern which I have repeatedly taken in his Wellfare. I trust you will forgive my endeavour to facilitate his Approach to your Lordships Notice. Your countenance must be of Signal benefit to him; And if I could in any degree contribute to procure it for him, should think I performed a meritorious office for a deserving Man. I am too old to be sure that my interposition may not be improper: but trust to your Lordships Indulgence. I continue to write I hope intelligibly: but my sight has so failed that it is with difficulty I read what I have written & must plead your excuse of inaccuracy.

I still conceive you as what you was and cannot apprehend any decrepitude or weekness whatever.

I have the honour to be with great Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most obedt & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
