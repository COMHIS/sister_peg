New York Septr. 14, 1778

Dear Sir,

Mr D'Erbage goes with The Letter to Admiral Gambier to be signed. To Avoid Repeating the word Received twice in places so near we have been Obliged to leave a Blank for the word favoured or honoured as you shall chuse. And Mr D'Erbage will fill it up as you desire.

When he comes back I mean to send him to Mr Cherry & Will Wait upon Admiral Gambier. If you have any Commands be so good as let me know  I am Otherwise to dine out of Town at Lord Cornwallis's but will wait upon you before I set out.

I have the Honour to be with The greatest Respect 
your most Obedient 
& most humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
