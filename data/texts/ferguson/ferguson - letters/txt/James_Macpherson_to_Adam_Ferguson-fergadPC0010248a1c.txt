London

My dear Sir,

I received your Express, late last night, upon my return from an Expedition, to the Country. We do not think the business, yet quite desperate. An Express with letters to the Adv———te, C———l Mur———y, &c will be sent to you, some time to-morrow. Care must be taken by Mr F———n, that it may come directly to your hands. It will be directed to you. When the battle becomes desperate———but not till then———we shall make the best retreat we can. We shall endeavour to secure you here; if we cannot effectually serve you there. I am, very much in haste, My dear Sir

yours &c &c &c

To Colonel Campbell 
P. is, what I always suspected him to be a———S: Why don't you send an Express to Pr——S——l for his immediate interference?
