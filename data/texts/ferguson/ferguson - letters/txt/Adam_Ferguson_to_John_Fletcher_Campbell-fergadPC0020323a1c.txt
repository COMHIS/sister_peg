5 Dec. [1786]

Dear General

Least I should not have the pleasure of seeing you tomorrow and because the warning is already too short, I send to beg the favour that you will dine here on Monday next with Mrs Mure who nothwithstanding the lameness of one of her Horses has promised to come. I have endeavoured to rouse the Gallantry of John Home to bring her in his Carriage. If you had any thing in Town besides a Skittish Mare I should certainly  have applied to you. I am your most Affectionate humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
