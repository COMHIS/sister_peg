Fludyer 10th May 1779

Dear Sir

I send you some Notes that have occurred to me in considering the tendency of the Inquiry now depending. I have been particularly Attentive as you desired to State the Rules of War &c but have been hurried into some General Animadversion of the whole Cause, you will attend only to what you think proper & consider if you please whether some General Views of this Sort ever Published might not have more Effect than longer & more Laboured Discussion. Whatever use may be made of it the faults  are Submitted to you & reserved for your Correction.

I have the Honour 
to be most Respectfully 
your most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
