London

My Dear Sir

I have received your letter and have seen Mr R. frequently. He desired me to inform you, that he & should write to St. Mc——— and that T. shall write to O. in the Parliament Close. But you know his hurry; and that may not happen, till I urge and see it done.

You may depend upon both. As to the principal people, in the two principal places, the person, who gave the scent ——— and who perhaps betrayed it, is gone to Scotland. We shall endeavour to enlighten you, on that ground, better than your friends here. We have every inclination; and where you can find we can aid, we shall assist, in the fulness of time. Not a syllable of news. Every thing quiet. O——— anihilated. But Tua  shabby as usual; Fer———n will explain Tua. I am most faithfully

yours J. M.
