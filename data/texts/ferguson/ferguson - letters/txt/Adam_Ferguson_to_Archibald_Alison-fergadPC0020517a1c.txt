St Andrews 11 July 1811

My Dear Sir

you will accept of my thanks for your Ingenious and valuable Performance on the Subject of Taste.

My defect of sight which renders me dependent on others for what I hear read, has so long deferred my acknowledgements.

I have indeed suspected that the distinction of Beauty & Deformity any more than those of Merit and Demerit Happiness & Misery, were not applicable to any mere Corporeal Essence or Form.

In this you have confirmed me by your ample and satisfactory Induction of Facts throughout the departments  of Matter in which we commonly fancy distinctions so expressed.

I was personally acquainted with the Late Capability Brown and if I could have put your work in his hands should have endeavoured to divert him and his Employers from the search of Capability and Beauty in subjects were it is merely Fanciful to those in which it is real. But this I may be told is Moralizing and adverse to the Taste of the Age. Be this as it may. I am happy to leave the Culture of Taste in such hands as yours.

I am my Dear Sir with most Sincere Esteem your obliged & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
