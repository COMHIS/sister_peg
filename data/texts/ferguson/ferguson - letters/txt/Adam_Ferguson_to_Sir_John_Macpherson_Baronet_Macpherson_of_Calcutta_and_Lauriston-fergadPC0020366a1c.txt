My Dear Friend

In Consequence of your good offices and Coll' Mc Kenzies note, I, by this post do the needfull to forward My Son Josephs promotion. As my Credit at London is with Messrs Coutts & Co I have instructed them to pay to the order of F. H. McKenzie of Seaforth Esqr £950 or £1000 as he shall require upon my Sons Appointment to the Command of a Company in the 78 Regiment of foot. My Account from the Regiment mentioned the Lower Sum which occasions the Alternative in my instructions & you may be sure I do not chuse to volunteer even with £50 if it can be avoided but the needful must be done. Your letter refers the Appointment to the 2d Battalion my letters from Joseph refer to the first in which he now is. And tho it would be ridiculous to keep in the Army & yet talk of chusing the place of Service yet this is of some consequence to our feelings.

My Son was in India & returned hastily on account of his health we have a kind of Hydrophobia towards India: but in my Instructions to the Banker  I have mentioned the 78 Regiment without disstinction of Battalions. I know you will forgive my Sending this notice to you to be Communicated to Mr Mc Kenzie of Seaforth. And as Coll' Mc Kenzie required the money to be lodged with any Banker in London I trust that the ordinary place of my dealings will be found proper enough for the occasion. The Duke of Queensberrys being out of Town may account for his Silence to his Man of Bussiness here about my future Castle & Other matters: but his orders will come when Convenient to His Grace. And I hope you will appear in this Place also when Convenient to you.

I am in conjunction with all your Friend[s] whom I see here

your most affectionate humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
