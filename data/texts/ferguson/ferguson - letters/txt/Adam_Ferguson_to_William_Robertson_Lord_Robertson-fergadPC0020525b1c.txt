My Dear Lord

I have received your letter containing the two copies of the inscription on your fathers Monument one for Mr Dempster which I have delivered & know his Sense of yr Kind Remembrance as well as My own of the Honour you have done me — In these acknowledgements I am afraid you will think me all too Slow but this is now the mode of my Existence & ill qualified to change it. It has enabled me to communicate with some of the learned men who join me in applauding the Eloquence & the appropriate terms of that composition. The Authority of Dr Gregory has no need of such Supports but I am fond to mention it. I thought your Fathers Birth & mine had been more scarcely dated but I see his preceded Mine by two whole years — altho I have survived so long to become my own Monument perishing you will say — but only more so — as less permanent than some other Grave Stones. I remember to have seen in Italy Miles & Leagues of ancient high ways strewed on right & left with continual Vestiges of Monuments now destroyed or in ruins with scarce a Name to Mark for whom they were intended but your fathers Memory is independent of such materials more fortunate than Tacitus or Livy. His works entire remain for  ages indefinite to shew that in his time the British Stile in able hands was fit to Emulate & cope with theirs it were too much vanity for me to think the opportunity will last of giving judgement how little I had profited by the Example he set me of liking talents & intellectual Eminence. My way is now directed to the trackless Grave & there My course Should terminate but for the happy thought that there is somewhat after death to which this nursery & school of human life is no more than preparation or a prelude.

Meantime however I remain &c
