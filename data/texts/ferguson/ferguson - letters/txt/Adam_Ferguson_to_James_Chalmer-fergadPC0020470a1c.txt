Hallyards near Peebles 5 Octr 1801

Dear Sir

The Documents on the Other leaf of this Paper will speak for themselves. Being apprised some time ago of a payment made by Mr Donaldson Agent to the 78 Regt in part Price of a Company Sold in that Regiment. And my son expressing your desire & his own to know how it should be disposed of: As I trust every thing in my Name will like this be the joint & equal Property of all my Children, my notion was that it should be vested in my Name, And I mentioned the 5 [xxx] 1797, when I understand it is so vested, with exception of My Son Adams own Share who having an Active Cash Account at Edr thinks it more for his advantage to [have] it placed to his Credit there, Upon the whole of Bussiness I am desirous to have the Stock Receipt in my Possession that I may enter a declaration on the back of it whose Property it is. In this according you will do the needful And Oblige your

Most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
