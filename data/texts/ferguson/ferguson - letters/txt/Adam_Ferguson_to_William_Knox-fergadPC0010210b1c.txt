Fludyer St. April 1779

Sir

I inclose with this Letter Duplicates of the Proclamations framed for Restoring the Provinces of Georgia & South Carolina to the Peace of the King & which The Commissioners have the Satisfaction to learn from Lord Geo. Germains Letter of 31st March are both approved of by His Majesty &  Confided with the necessary Instructions to Sir James Wright. These Duplicates, it was thought proper to execute, in order that His Lordship if he thinks proper may send them by a Separate Conveyance the better to Secure the accomplishments of His Majestys Gracious Purpose respecting those Colonies.

I am Sir with great Respect your most Obed.t & most humble Servant
