Nydpath Castle 4th Decr 
1795



My Dear Friend

If ever you enjoined me to return the inclosed; that Circumstance escaped me and it was carefully laid up among my Archives as a monument of the times. I rejoice however in the Idea that you have now occasion to call it forth. The times, upon the present Rout of the French on the Rhine & the difficulty of restoring their Force in the present state of their Finances, are probably as favourable as those to which the Paper refers. As to myself I have now only to tell you that I have no hopes of my Friend at Alva.

That I am impatient enough to have some settlement at Nydpath to Authorize the repairs &c which the weather shows to be necessary.

And that My Son Adam is now a Master writer or writer to the Signet at your Service & ready to take the trouble of any ones bussiness who will employ him. And finally that I am

My Dear Friend yours &c 
Adam Ferguson
