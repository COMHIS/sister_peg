London April 3d, 1779

Sir,

I enclose with this Letter Duplicates of the Proclamations framed to restore the Provinces of Georgia & South Carolina to The Peace of The King, and which The Commissioners have the Satisfaction to learn from Lord George Germains Letter of the 31st March are Approved by His Majesty, & confided with the necessary Instructions to Sir James Wright. These Duplicates it was thought proper to execute  in order that His Lordship if he thinks proper may send them by a Separate Conveyance, the better to secure the accomplishment of His Majestys gracious Purpose respecting those Colonys.

I am with great Respect Sir Your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
