London 10 June 1780

My dear Sir

The decisive measure of Wednesday has, in a manner, extinguished the Revolt. Every thing is quiet; tho' the same military appearances are still kept up. A Camp in Hyde Park, one in St James's Park. The bridges occupied with troops; the principal Streets secured; a detachment in St Paul's ——— one in the Exchange &c, and patroles passing and repassing to every post. The people, who had great reason to be terrified, are full of gratitude to the military; and, under their protection, are arming themselves in every district of the town. Ld George was conveyed, late last night, to the Tower; and New discoveries are hourly made. A proclamation is issued, with pardons and rewards, for discoveries; a special commission is issuing and the trials will come on, early in the week. Not a syllable of foreign news. The minds of mankind are entirely taken up, by this new occurrence.

Now to business ——— I was, this morning, with R. . . . He wishes to have the & Perth &c out of Ds hands. The Bs are five. . . . Five hundred to each & of three, which & makes a Majy. One or two hundred to each of the delegates. The two principal ones  take nothing. They only wish for a friend of R's and that friend to be a countryman.

The mode is this: let a clever fellow, a man of & business to go to the spot, or take some method of sounding them. They are ready to treat ——— R. thinks our friend the Col. who left us, t'other day, the fittest man possible. The thing is certain, by common, but able management. Let it be set about immediately ——— before D. turns his face to the North Pole. . . . There is no straw there to make bricks with. Verbum sat ——— . If the C———l is not gone to Ireland, he will explain to you any difficulties, that may appear, in the above. The subject is obscure. An exertion in this bussiness will be highly pleasing here.
