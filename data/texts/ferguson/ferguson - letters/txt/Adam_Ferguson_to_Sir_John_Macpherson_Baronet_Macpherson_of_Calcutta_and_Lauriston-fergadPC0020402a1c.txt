My Dear Friend

I have to thank you for two letters since I wrote last, one inclosing the Correspondence of our little Seaman to be, the Other informing me of your Country acquisition in which I cordially rejoice. I hope it will occasionally give you that possession of yourself which the Town is so apt to disturb.

You are still Consolatory on the State of publick Affairs which is very fortunate for me who have had no Other Consolation for years past. In recollecting some little experience of my own however I come to think that if one does properly what the occasion requires whether adverse or prosperous Events are not such bad things as they appear to be, & do I shall leave the subject of Politics a Vous Autre. Thank Mrs Nugent for me on her Project of having our little man rated on board the Caesar. I need not say how happy I shall think him under Captain Nugent. I trouble you with the inclosed Correspondence notwithstanding your being in the Country may increase that Effect. However it may be forwarded when you are writing to your people at Brompton however or when you go thither yourself. We have had a Visit of Dr Black here for about a week but we could not detain him, he cannot pass his time in Country, he says, or away from his ordinary Occupations. This I understand. I hope that if you do not take to Country Cares & attentions you will at least have your pen and Ink & if not Rus in Urbe, Urbem & Mundum in Rure.

My Hay is all Safely got up & yet I am not satisfied till I have better news of Europe. I am My Dear Friend

your most affectionate Humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
