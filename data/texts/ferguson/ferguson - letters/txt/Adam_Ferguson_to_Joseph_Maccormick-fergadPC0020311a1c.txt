Edinburgh 28th April 1785

Dear Sir

Give me leave to recommend to your Esteem & Good Offices my Friend Mr Gardiner who tells me his Friends in your University have proposed him for the Degree of Doctor of Laws. He has been long known to me by the best Character & I should have gladly Supported him in the Same Pretensions here: but his Application is so far gone with you as to make it necessary the matter should come to an Issue, which I make no doubt you will find Sufficient Reason to make the most favourable for him. I am Dear Sir, with the most Sincere Regard your most Obedient

and Most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
