To The Living From The Dead 
We whose Bones are buried here 
have trod like you this Scene of Earth 
And seen Those Works of God 
which you behold. The Sight is 
glorious and if Understood 
will more than Recompence The 
ills you Suffer: While in this 
Nursery of Intellectual Being, your 
malice & your Other Childish Follies 
marked for Reprobation are 
repressed with Stripes. The 
Summit of your Glory now is to 
Mean well & be Diligent. The boundless 
that placed you here will find 
Successive Stages for your Action. 
Inquire not When nor Where It is better 
far than can you can Guess or Fancy 
when did the Infant in Parents Womb 
Anticipate the Light of De . . . 
The Uses of his Limbs and 
Organs. The Tasks fire 
hard for him on Earth . . . .
