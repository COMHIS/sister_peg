Edinburgh, 11 Mar. 1774

My Dear Sir,

I don't know whether You may not allude to a letter that I have not received, but it is likely that none have miscarried. And I thought my last decisive as to my resolutions and intended Motions. I have laboured hard to finish at the College and have put an end to one Species of Philosophy today and shall to another tomorrow. I have fixed to set out for London with J. Ferguson on Tuesday the Fifteenth of this Month, but as my Companion is indulgent to himself and Lazy may not be in London before Sunday or Monday thereafter. I write this merely because you say you are uneasy at not hearing from me. Am perfectly Satisfied with the whole manner and State of the Transactions and defer particularly till we meet. I have been dining with D. Hume who says you have never yet made any attempt to cure him on his Pet altho it be a great and a growing distemper. I am

My Dear Sir 
Your most affectionately 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
