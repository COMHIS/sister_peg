St Andrews 4 April 1812

My Dear Lord

Give me leave to indulge myself in the Satisfaction I receive on your Lordships accession to the Head of the Admiralty Board when your name is endeared to the fleet by the Memory of your Fathers Beneficence.

I always experienced from him a Goodness which flowed from the Heart and to which I was not insensible.

If his Partiality should be hereditary I may meet with a Notice from your Lordship to which I am not otherwise entitled. It is indeed  but an ill return on my part to be adding to the load of importunities to which you are now exposed but I cannot forbear reminding your Lordship that I have a son in the Navy for whom to implore your Protection in the Way of his Profession a Way in which he may incur Competition with Persons of a Class and was never surpassed by any order of Men in the World: but it rests with him not to be exemptd from this [xxx] and if so it will rest with me  thankfully to acquiesce in the Judgement you will pass on his Claims. He will be to Lay his Respects to your Lordship soon and will trouble you with his name & Services in a more legible hand than mine.

I have the Honour to be with great Respect 
My Dear Lord 
your Lordships most affectionate 
most obedien[t] humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson











P.S. Mr Ferguson had for some time discontinued to write for his Sight scarcely inables him to see the Paper, much less its see the point at which he Left off when he lefts the Pen for a supply of Ink- but as he never wrote to Lord Melville with any other hand but his own he was resolved to renew the attempt trusting that every person who bears the Title of Lord Melville will forgive the defects and if he cannot read favourably interprete his meaning.
