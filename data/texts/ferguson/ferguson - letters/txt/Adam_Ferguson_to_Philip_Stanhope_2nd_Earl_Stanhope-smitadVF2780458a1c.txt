Edinburgh, 14 February 1778

My Lord

Your Lordship will see from the Inclosed letter that I have received by My Lord Chesterfields order Â£200 on account of my claim of an Annuity from His Lordship. I had transmitted the Contents of your Lordships last letter to My Agent Mr James Chalmer of Leicesterfields and charged him to bring that matter to some final settlement. I cannot state his difficultys better to your Lordships than by transmitting his Answer to me which I accordingly take the Liberty to do. And have the honour to be with the most affectionate respects to your Lordships Family.

My Lord 
Your Lordships 
most obliged 
and most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
