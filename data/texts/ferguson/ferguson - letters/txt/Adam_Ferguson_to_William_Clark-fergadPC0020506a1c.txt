Hallyards 27 Janry 1808

My Dear Sir

I have received your Letter acquainting me that you accept my Offer of the House in Rose Court at Whitsunday next for five hundred Pounds you having entry to the Premises at that Term and paying the Price at the time of getting possession when I will give the proper Conveyance to the Property. To these conditions I now agree. And now write to Warn the Tennant of this Circumstance and the Necessity of her removeal at the next Term of Whitsunday 1808. And am Dear Sir your most obedt

& most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

P.S. As to publick Gardens on the House in Rose Court I can give no distinct Account. They had run in Arrear in Adams time. And I was made to pay Â£10 for the time he occupyd the House what was abt two years. The Regiment to which he belongs has warning to prepare for a Remove to the Cape of Good Hope and he tho now Aid de Camp to Gen. Don in Febry has warning to attend if whether we have hopes of being allowed to purchase a Company if occasion offer & have lodged mony for that Purpose but this is doubtfull.

I am Glad your Mother is recovered and that your Father is well. At any rate he must not presume to go before me who am his Senior.

A. F.
