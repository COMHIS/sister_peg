Fludyer Street NÂº 21 March 26th 1779

Dear Sir

I delivered the day before yesterday, at your Office, a Letter from His Majestys Commissioners & to Lord George Germain inclosing a Copy of a Memorial from the Merchants trading to Georgia, And a Proclamation in consequence of their Request to restore that Province to the Peace of the King. I have Another Copy of the same Proclamation intended by the Commissioners to be sent to Sir Henry Clinton least the Former should be intercepted or lost. And you will please let me know whether the  measure is Approved of by His Majesty, in such manner, that I may proceed to forward this Duplicate to Sir Henry Clinton accordingly.

It is the opinion of His Majestys Commissioners that Similar Proclamation should be prepared & committed to the Discretion of Proper Officer in America for Restoring South Carolina likewise to the Peace of the King. Such Proclamations are accordingly prepared & already Signed & Sealed by two of the Commissioners & will probably have the Signature of The Third Commissioner today. Be so good as inform me whether I shoud send one of the Copys, as I did of that respecting Georgia, to Lord George Germain & if approved of transmit the other to Sir Henry Clinton to be produced or Suppressed at his Discretion or that of the Officer Commanding in South Carolina, in Case His Majestys Troops shall have obtained a Proper Footing there.

I shall wait upon you today at The Office or wherever else you shall appoint, at one O'Clock, to know what Report I shall make to The Commissioners on these Several Particulars.

I am with great Respect 
Dear Sir 
Your most Obedient 
& most Humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
