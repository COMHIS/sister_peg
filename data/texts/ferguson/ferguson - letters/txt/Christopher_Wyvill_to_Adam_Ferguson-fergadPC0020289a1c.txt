Burton Hall Novr 14th 1782

Sir

Having been long accustomed, from the General Spirit of your writings, to consider you as a Sincere and Zealous friend to the Constitution of our Country, I take the liberty to transmit to you the inclosed Proposal of the Yorkshire Committee for a General Reformation of Parliament, in respect both to its frame and duration; and also, for the extension and better regulation of the Right of Election to Parliament throughout the Kingdom. It would Give the Yorkshire Gentlemen the Greatest Satisfaction to find their propositions are honoured with your approbation, and that of the Committee of Edinburgh; or any other Public Body of men to whom you may have the goodness to communicate them.

I have the honour to be, sir with Great Respect your most Humble Servant

C. Wyvill
