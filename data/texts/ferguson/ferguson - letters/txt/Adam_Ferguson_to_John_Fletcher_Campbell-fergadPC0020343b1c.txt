My Dear Genl

I long much for the return of old habits & Practices, was twice in the street this week with intention to reach Frederic Street, if I could; but found it rather too much with the prospect of coming back on foot. I am however very Ostensible within these Walls & have for some time ventured to the Parlour at Dinner time. If you have lost the habit of coming here of a Sunday & trusting to such fare as ours we shall go into mourning but I hope not.

yours most Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
