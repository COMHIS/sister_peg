Dear Sir

My Man is just now returned from Bankhead having committed Such a Blunder as requires my going there tomorrow morning: but I wish to know whether I may hope to see you at any Other time, if not; This call to the Country must be neglected rather than be out of your way when you call. I should set out about 8 in the morning & return before four to Receive J. Home & General Mc Nab in the Evening. If I dont hear from you may I venture to think that you do not go before thursday  or Friday, so that I may find you at Milton House some of those days.

I am My Dear Sir 
your most Affectionate 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
