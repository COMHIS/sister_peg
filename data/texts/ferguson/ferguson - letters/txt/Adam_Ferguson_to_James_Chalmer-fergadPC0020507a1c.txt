Hallyards near Peebles Janry 29, 1808

Dear Sir

I have heard from Mr Samu[e]l Burnett of Lloyds Coffee House that the Deed in favour of my Daughters of which the Form was sent to America at the desire of Robert Ferguson is now executed & returned by him. Mr Burnett desires to have my directions about the Paper & I have desired him to lodge it with you in hopes that you may find a Safe conveyance for it hither. Perhaps you may know of some Friend coming to this Country or if you think it safe enough  by the Post I will not grudge the Postage or if it be safe in a Frank.

My Friend Fordyce who is not limited as Members of Parliament are to a certain weight will frank it for me.

But for this there is no haste. Whatever charge has been already incurred in the matter be so good as discharge to my account.

I am now anxious to have my Account with Robert Ferguson as residuary Legatee of His Father & my Brother now made up while I am in the way to look after it and have the Sum I am to Surrender neatly.

Ascertained It came to my hands from different Quarters in Separate payments & in the Interval of some years. My son was joint Executor with me  and I relyed upon him for the particulars. He is not now in this Country And my own Notes do not Satisfy me as to the whole amount. I am now therefore recurring to all the Quarters from which any money was received by me on account of my Brothers Will to correct or corroborate my own Notes.

Part was received from a Mr Mitchel either Banker or Agent. This I believe passed through your Hands. And if any such House or Person as Mitchel now remains be so Good as desire to turn up their Books & say what Sum I received from them on Acct. of my Brothers will. This Compared with your own Books will be Satisfactory to me on that particular Item. I am Dear Sir

your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
