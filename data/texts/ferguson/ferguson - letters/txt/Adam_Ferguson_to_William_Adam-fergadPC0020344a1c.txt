Ferguson informs William Adam of having seen in Edinburgh Mr Elphinstone of the India Board, on the subject of a Cadetship of Artillery on the Bengale Establishment for his son Joseph. He thanks his correspondent for his good offices of which he is not surprised, although ‘they bring the more pleasure that they were unsolicited’. He is nevertheless ‘grievously affraid of another years dissappointment’, because the boy should have gone out to India with his uncle, and asks William Adam to continue to help him in this matter. He sends respectful compliments to Mrs Adam.
