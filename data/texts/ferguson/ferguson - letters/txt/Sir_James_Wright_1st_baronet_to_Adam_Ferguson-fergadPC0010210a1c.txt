Sir

It being very late at night when I received my Despatches from the Secretary of States Office, & setting out early the next morning, I did not open the Packet till after I got here last Night, or should have acknowledged  the Receipt of your Favour with the Inclosures sooner.

I have received their Excellencies two Proclamations for restoring Peace to Georgia, & South Carolina, to be published or not, as Circumstances may happen, Also their Excellencies Commission revoking their Provisional Appointment of Coll. Campbell which I shall make use of or cancell as Occasion May Require.

I beg to offer my most respectfull Complts. to their Excellencies, & have the Honour to be with much Esteem

Sir Your Obliged & Obedt Servant
