My Dear Friend

Here I am bussy Sowing oats not wild oats but very tame ones I can assure you. Take my thanks for the Thoughts on the late Negotiations. I am perhaps the only person in Tweedale who can trace your Steps more or less; but I think I perceive them in certain meetings mentioned in the news paper. If the Snow is not too much frozen the Ball you have begun to roll must increase. And so I hope that good will come of it.

Having little to say I have long delayed writing & should delay still but for an occasion to Peebles that hurries me being in haste to be gone & we are both perhaps Obliged to it for preventing the effusion of human Ink. All I wish you to know for the Present is that I am most Affectionately yours

A. Ferguson
