My Dear Sir

The Trustees for the Publication of my late Uncles Manuscripts, have, owing to particular circumstances, come to the resolution of preparing for the press such of them as can without offence be at present given to the Public; It would greatly enhance the value of the work if you would favour myself & the other Trustees with those recollections & remarks upon his life & Character which you are so able to affordâ€” and you would thereby lay myself under a most particular obligation.
