Siennes Sunday morning [20 December 1789]

My Dear General

I have transferred Dd Hume to Wednesday for which day I hope you are ready to engage yourself. And that John Home also will be more free to come than on Tuesday the day on which he was engaged with you to Mr Rannies.

All this I hope will be more clearly discussed at Dinner if you favour us with the Sundays Call, Doctor Black declines exposing himself: but Hutton will I hope make his appearance at the usual time.

yours most 
Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
