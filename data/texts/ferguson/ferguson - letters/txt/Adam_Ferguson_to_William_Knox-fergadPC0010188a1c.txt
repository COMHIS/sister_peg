Duplicate NÂº 18 New York, 19th October, 1778

Sir,

As it appears that from some Inadvertency the Dispatches from His Majesty's Commissioners to the Secretary of State have not been properly numbered, I now inclose a List of them and beg you will number, according to this List, those You have received, as I have done the Copies We have kept.

I have the honour to be 
Sir 
your most obedient and 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson









William Knox, Esq.
