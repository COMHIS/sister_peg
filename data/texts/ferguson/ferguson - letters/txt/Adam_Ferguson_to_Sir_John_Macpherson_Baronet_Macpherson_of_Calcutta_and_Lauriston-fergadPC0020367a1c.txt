Nidpath Castle 3d Septr 
 1795



Dr Ferguson

My Dear Friend

There is a kind of good luck in being Otherwise occupied till we can meet without interruption or Care. If you have Bussiness at Edr your humble Servant has had bussiness at Edr and here for Some weeks past that would overwhelm an Upholsterer a Bookseller & a Scavenger. No matter when it began it is continued & far from being ended.

The dinners you talk of &c &c may give time at least for so much order as to make this Castle habitable. The Woods The Hills The River &c are Elysian And the Atmosphere all composed of Vital Air. So that your journey hitherto has agreed with you you may here expect the Completion of all its Effects.

I write merely to prevent your making such engagements at Edinburgh as will detain you there longer than necessity requires. Beware of Edr it is a cramming Place & come here in time to digest and Evaporate all its Mischief. your most Affectionately

Adam Ferguson
