[?1786]

My Dear Sir

I dont know what to say of this man, it is very teasing & yet this Edition is rather more Correct than I should have expected. It is scarcely worth while to think of it any more. It is strange that he cant get a thing printed in the same portable form with the pamphlet it answers. If it were necessary to do any more I would try to find out who prints the Actual Grubs that are hawked in the Street & so employ the same hands-but I doubt it is not worth more trouble. We shall consider it more at meeting.

yours &c
