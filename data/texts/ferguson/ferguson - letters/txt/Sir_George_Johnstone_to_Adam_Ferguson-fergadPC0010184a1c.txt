Dear sir

I leave in your possession compleat, indisputable evidence, that no act of mine, by word, writing, message or conversation with any person whatsoever, could hae been conceied by the member of Congress, Joseph Reed, Esq., previous to the 19th of July last, as an attempt, or as having a tendency, in any manner whatsoever to corrupt his integrity.

A regard to the faith of private communications, and an attentino to the peace and safety of inocent individuals, under the horrid cruelties that are daily exercised to maintain the present system of government by the Congress and Committees, restrain me from making tis and other evidence public. But when the time shall arrive that may render such communications proper I am persuaded the world will aplaud my self denial in refusing myself the Satisfactino of publishing so compleat a refutation of the aspersions attempted to be thrown on my character by the resolution of the Congress, founded on a species of testimony that could not affect me, upon any rule of evidence or any fair construction of language.

Another matter I wish the world to know is, that I do not return to England on account of that proceeding of Congress. The other Comissioners as well as you and all persons with whom I have lived in any degree of intimacy here, and all my correspondents in England are sufficiently acquainted, that I had determined to return to London by the meeting of Parliament, to give my voice and opinion against yielding to the claim of independency, long before any such resolves of the Congress had passed.

I am, with esteem and affection Your sincere friend,

George Johnstone
