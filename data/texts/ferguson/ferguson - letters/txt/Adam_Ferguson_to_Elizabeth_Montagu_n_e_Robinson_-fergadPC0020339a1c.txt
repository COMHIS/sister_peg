Sciennes 4th March 1790

Dear Madam

I can without hesitation or reserve answer the Question which you put to me having read Mr Alisons Book soon after it was published. This volume is given but for a part of the intended Work. It is written in my opinion with perspicuity ease and Elegance. His Arguments on the different points he undertakes to Prove, full & to me convincing. So that I think it must do him great credit with the Publick & satisfy his friends that they may venture to recommend him with great Confidence.

I have the honour to be Dr Madam

your most Obedt & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
