London October 10th, 1766

I have not wrote you for some time. I suppose that your book is printing. Lord Shelburne told me one day that he supposed Governor Johnson would not perhaps return to West Florida, as he is coming home, and sayd, that he saw no reason why he should not offer the government of it to you. I answered that I should write to you of his kindness for you long before it should be an object of deliberation, but that I thought you would be happier in your present situation, and more independent, for the other was uncertain, though, in the common way of thinking in the world, it was a great favour. Besides, I thought that you was of more service to mankind where you was. He laughed at me. We shall have time to consider of this. However, it shows Lord Shelburne's kindness for you, and good opinion of you. You asked my opinion about a subject which I shall give you when at leisure. Yours affectionately.
