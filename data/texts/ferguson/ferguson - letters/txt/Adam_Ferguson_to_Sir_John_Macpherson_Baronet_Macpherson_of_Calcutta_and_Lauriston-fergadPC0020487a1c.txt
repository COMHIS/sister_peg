My Dear Friend

I sit down in darkness or in a State approaching to blindness with sore Eyes to acknowledge your kind letters. & my Seamans Triumph in being passed for Lieutennant. Of what is to be done next I am intirely Ignorant & will therefore Submit to any orders he may receive & hope he will be ready Serve in any quarter of the World. My Constant injunction to him is to mind his own Duty not how Other People behave to him. It is not always Good to be a Favourite with those who Command.

I hope I shall at this time make no mistakes in closing My Letter. I recollect being in a hurry  when I proposed to inclose your Friend Otts letter. I have now Some Curiosity to know what went instead of it. I hope it was not a Billet Doux from any of the Octogenaire Nymphs of this Nighbourhood. If so I can only beg of you to be discreet. I am happy to think you have so much Scope for the exercise of your Beneficent & Peace Making temper. Reading or writing is a principal Prohibition under which I now lye & therefore Conclude with my most affectionate Respects to you &c &c

Adam Ferguson
