Hallyards near Peebles 22 April 1805

Gentlemen

I have received the two Quarto Vols you sent accompanyed with a Letter from Cadel and Davis concluding with their opinion on the subject of an Octavo Edition. The same they told me a year or two ago; but is not an Answer to the Question I wished you to put. This was to sound them on the Subject of transferring the Property, which as the Sale is so dull I should think they may not be unwilling to do. If so I should wish to know upon what terms that I might determine what is proper for me to do either now or by such improvements as occur to me left to my Heirs. In all this I wish you to proceed as from yourselves without any mention of me.

N.B. you will please to Observe that if Cadel & Davis were to print a new Edition there would be two hundred pounds due to me. I am Gentlemen

your most Obedient 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
