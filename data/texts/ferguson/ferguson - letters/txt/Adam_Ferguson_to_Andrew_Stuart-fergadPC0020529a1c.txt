[1772]

Dear Sr

The inclosed are Answers to some Queries I put to a Relation of My Wife now at Aberdeen who lived long at Batavia in quality of English Consul. The Dutch have reputation for good Government & I wished to have some notion of their Establishment in India. These queries were put carelessly in a Postscript & with little recollection. The Answers however are disstinct and Satisfactory. I have them here for your perusal that if any thing occur to you I may question him farther. I shall write him sometime next week after I have again considered this Paper & got your Animadversions. Please consider whether this Dutch Book may

 be worth ordering. 
I am 
Dear Sr 
yours most 
affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
