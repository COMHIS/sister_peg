Hallyards near Peebles, N.B., 1st March 1797

. . . before this will have come to hand you will, I trust, have heard of the arrival of your friend, my son Joseph, again in India. He goes at the head of a Company. May his health continue better than it was when he left you (1793). The lot of a military man is to go where he is ordered or to quit the service. My blessing to him and you. There will be a letter for him from this family by the same conveyance with this.

I am, my dear sir, most affectionately yours

Adam Ferguson
