My Dear Sir

I called to beg the favour that you will take your chance of a Dinner at the Sciennes tomorrow any time between three and Four. John Johnstone is now here and has promised to meet you with all his London news. I have also to tell you that I have a line from Sir John McPherson with news of an easy deliverance from his Tryal at the expence of Â£3000. He seems to be relieved of a great Load and breathes easily. Be sure you come tomorrow.

I am Dr Sr yours most affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
