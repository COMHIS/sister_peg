London, 24 February 1767

Dear Ferguson

I happen'd yesterday to visit a person three hours after [xxx] a [xxx] Copy of your Performance was open'd for the first time in London. It was by Lord Mansfield. I accept the Omen of its future Success. He was extremely pleas'd with it; said it was perfectly well wrote; assured me, that he woud not stop a moment till he had finish'd it, and recommended it Strongly to the Perusal of the Archbishop of Yorke, who was present.

Tho' I set out with Reluctance I do not repent my Journey. Direct me at Miss Elliotts in Brewer's Street. I have not seen Smith: Judge of my hurry.

Yours Sincerely

David Hume
