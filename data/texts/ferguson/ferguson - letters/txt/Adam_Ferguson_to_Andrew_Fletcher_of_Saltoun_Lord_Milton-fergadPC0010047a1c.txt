London Septr 13th 1762

My Lord

The Inclosed letters were sent to me that I might carry them to your Lordship: but being obliged to delay my setting out for some days it is proper that I forward them by the Post. Captain Fletcher was advised by Dr Pringle to go to the South of France for his health & The Duke of Bedfords going furnishing him with so good an opportunity of going without a Passport that he had no time to consult your Lordship upon it before he set out. He is still the youngest Captain in the Regiment & has only Lieutennants Pay there being a Captain from that Regiment allowed to retire upon his full pay. But this probably will not long be the Case as the Regiment is now before the Havanna. I will refer farther Particulars  and all Political news from this place till I have the pleasure of Seeing your Lordship.

Mr Oswald in a cover under which he sent me the Inclosed desires that I woud Join my Testimony to his Recommendation of Mr Drysdale. Which I do most willingly as Mr Drysdale has been my Intimate Friend for many years and I know him to be a very deserving Man who upon farther knowledge or tryal woud give your Lordship great Satisfaction.

I expect to be at Edinburgh in about a fortnight when I long to entertain you with what I have been able to understand of the temper of this place and am with the Most Sincere Respect and Affection your Lordships

Most Obliged & 
mostle humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
