Frankfort 25 Septr 1793

My Dear Friend

I wrote you a line from Ostend to give notice of my Safe Arrival on the Continent. I have Since made out so far of my Journey. To this place, where I halt a Day or two: but do not find that I can venture to go in Search of the Marquis Lucchesini & therefore inclose your Letter to him & consign it to the Post with my regret for not being able to do more. Military matters are well here, a Devision of French Prisoners has just past a Second is expected at Night & a third tomorrow amounting in all to about three thousand men taken in Battle lately by the Duke of Brunswick but I cannot learn where. You pelted me with Letters from the Continent to which I was not enabled to make any Answer, I should be sorry to return you the Compliment exactly. My pelting will be very Moderate And your Answers I hope will come, tho I dont at present know where to  direct them nearer than Rome to the Care of Mr Jenkins Banker, And there, in the name of God let them come as many & as soon as Possible that is to say much Sooner than Gleich  & Geswind  which I have generally found to be as slow as possible.

All I have to say for the present is that travelling even here is certainly a very healthy bussiness, for I thrive wonderfully upon it. I have some inducements to go by Munich & to take the Inland Route by Nurenburg &c as I know less of it than I do of the Other & the Road I am told is good. I sometimes torment myself with thinking what is become of the World: but as I have no Commission to govern it, the wisest course is to mind my Route & so shall do in the best humour I can muster. Believe me to be

Yours most Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
