Edinburgh, September 1766

My Dear Miss Katy,

A letter from me may possibly surprise you. I was very sorry to be obliged to leave Aberdeen without preparing you more gradually for the subject of it; but I hope that you will overlook every circumstance in the manner, for the sake of the very sincere good intention from which I act. The esteem and the love with which I am seized to you make me earnestly desire a much more near relation than that which has produced me the happiness of your acquaintance. If the tremendous name of Husband does not alarm you, that is the cousinship which I wish to bear to you. I would willingly carry this request to Aberdeen myself, but you will perhaps rather answer a letter than a verbal proposal, especially if your answer be such as I should be sorry to find it. My happiness very much depends on your allowing me to hope that I may see you before winter, and return from Aberdeen, I would fain wish, in your company, with a heart as full of joy as it was of regret at my parting with you last. If this proposal be disagreeable to you, I shall be most sincerely afflicted; if otherwise, do not torment me with reserve, where frankness would endear you to me so much. I am, with a very solicitous expectation of your answer, your most affectionate and most humble servant

Adam Ferguson
