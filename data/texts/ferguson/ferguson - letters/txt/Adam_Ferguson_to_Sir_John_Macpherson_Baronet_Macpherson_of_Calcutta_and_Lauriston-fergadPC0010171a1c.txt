From on board The Trident Delaware River June 19th 1778

My Dear Friend

Leaving you to Suppose that we have had a Good passage and Every thing of that Sort agreeable I write now merely to tell you That as soon as Mr. Stracheys departure for Europe was known the Commissioners resolved to appoint me as their Secretary & have honoured me with a Commission of which the Inclosed is a Copy. No pecuniary appointments are Specifyed that Point must be fixed & the whole confirmed by the King. I need not mention how much I rely on Your Good offices  to help me in both these points, my Views are not high on the first, or rather I wish that something rather more Permanent than great were done. I write to The Solicitor General to Mr Robinson & to Mr Pulteney on the Subject with a Copy of my appointment to each. So you will take what help you can from those Gentlemen or any Other person you think Proper. I set out from Home Philadelphia with a Flag and a Trumpet for Washingtons Camp in my way to the Congress: but was met at one of the out Posts of their Army with a Very Civil Letter intimating that he from General Washington coud not grant a Passport without previous instructions from Congress. The Dispatches went but there is yet no return & we expect none till  after we are settled at New York. Proposals are made which the Congress will scarcely be being able to reject without losing The Support of their Constituents. And yet Gfalou and Dough so as I am at this writing very much affraid. I wish to God I had been at the Ear of Tua & listened to when certain orders were given. The reasons may have been good & the Event may dissappoint our fears in all which we shall rejoice. Pray Make up my Wifes letters in packets bundles & send them by The Packet to New York or Otherwise. Say nothing of My Conjectures when they happen to be dissagreeable. Write me what you may expose to be miscarryed inspected or lost. I am most Affectionately

Your Adam Ferguson
