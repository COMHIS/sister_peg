Edinburgh April 27, 1783

Dear Sir

I was informed last year by a Friend, who was then at the Court of Brunswick, That The Duke did me the honour to mention me as an Author, and it was Suggested at the Same time that if I should publish more it might be considered as a proper mark of respect to send a Copy to His Highness' Library.

I wish for an opportunity to do so & have mentioned the Commission to some of my Friends here who are going to the Continent particularly Sir James Hall and my Colleague Mr Dugald  Stuart who attends Lord Ancram in an excursion abroad.

Either of them if he goes by Brunswick will take charge of a Copy of my History And you will be so good as deliver it to my Account. I should be glad it were bound Simply & elegantly but not finely. And marked

‘For His Serene Highness 
The Duke of Brunswicks 
Library from the Author’





I am Dear Sir your most obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
