London July 27th 1780

My dear Sir

I received your letter Tuath having refused an office lately to Ld G———y, no letter can be written to his Lordship. What seems a little strange, I can find none in Office, that is personally acquainted with Ld Kinnoul; but I have taken measures, for obtaining a recommendation from Lord Mansfield. . . . The secret history of the Athol business is this: Capt. Murray is only pressed unwillingly into the service; and he only wishes for a decent expence to decline altogether. A kind of half promise of future support, from his friends would, it is thought here, be sufficient. The Lord Privy Seal has answered the letter, sent by the Express, in the very best manner. Mr Paterson has done the same; and he is hard at work for you. A letter will be immediately written to the Lord Advocate to co-operate with you; and this is all, I can mention at present. I hope our friend, if no strange neglect happened at Dublin, relative to his leave of absence, is, by this time, among you. ——— I forgot to write to him, when the leave was sent off; but he must have had my letter, in the end of the last week. I am, most sincerely yours &c &c
