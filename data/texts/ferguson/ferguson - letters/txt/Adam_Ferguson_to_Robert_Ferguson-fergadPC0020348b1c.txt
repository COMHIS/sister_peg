London, 19th March 1792

My Dear Sir

The bearer, Joseph Ferguson, my son, carrys a letter from his Father to you which might be sufficient for every purpose, but I cannot let him depart without some expression of my affection for you and full confidence that as far as you have opportunity you will be as a brother to him. His uncle, Captain Burnett, will, I hope, be in Bengall to receive him at his arrival and be his parent there; but in his absence I shall rely on you and gratefully repay any supply that may be necessary to him. He has many letters: one in particular to Colonel Ross, in which I remind him of my thanks for good offices to you, of which I shall be glad to know the continuance. It will be obliging to drop me a letter with the return of ships from India with accounts of yourself and this young person in his joining the corps to which he is appointed. I am, my dear Sir, your most affectionate and most

humble servant

Adam Ferguson
