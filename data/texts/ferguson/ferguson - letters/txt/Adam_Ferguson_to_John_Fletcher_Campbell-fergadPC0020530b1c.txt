My Dear Sir

Having heard yesterday that an Answer was coming out to the reasons against a Scotch Militia I sent for it, & got the Inclosed. I have since shown it no Mr N —  who is of the same opinion with me, that Such fine paper & Print &c is unsuitable to the Spirit of the performance, that it even mars the effect. He thinks it worth while to have another impression without loss of time that it should be in coarse Paper &c and Sold for a penny, no matter he says whether the Sale pay Costs that there  is some Subscription fund to which the ballance of expence may be charged &c &c. Upon this Idea I have Scratched a few touches for your use & correction. If you approve they may go into the impression proposed. N — is very desirous that it should be in the hands of the Cadies & sold for a penny at the Door of the Parliament house on Tuesday Morning. I hope that this will find you Safely arrived in Town. I am very glad you have had so good a day. We of this house hear much of your Olla on Tuesday but dont yet know whether we Should come to it or no.

Dugald Stuart was here to make an Appointment  to take us up in a Coach which I have agreed to at hazard tho upon counting noses I wish you may have room for every body whom the reputation of an Olla may Attract. Yours most Affectionately

A. F.
