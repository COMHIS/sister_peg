My Dear Sir

I am not at all Surprised that you should lose patience or that I who abuse it should be scolded: but I hope that matters will turn better at least that they are coming to an end, Seriously I am exceedingly Obliged to you for your Continu[e]d attention: I have been considering often in what terms I could thank you; for I never felt my Obligation more in all my Life: but I hope that you are a Stock holder just now and that you will be rewarded  for your good deeds even in this life. I pray you mark me among the next corrections if we are to have Peace. I

am Dear Sir your most 
Obedient & most humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
