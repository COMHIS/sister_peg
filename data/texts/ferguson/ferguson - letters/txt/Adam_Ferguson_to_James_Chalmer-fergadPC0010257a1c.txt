Edr 10th Novr 1780

Dear Sir

In looking over Lord Chesterfields deed of settlement I find that Â£100 for the last half year was due on the 29th of September last. If you have not made application for Payment of it, I beg that you will without Delay. Running more into Arrears may be inconvenient to his Lordship as well as to me & make him feel the inconvenience of this Bussiness more as it may expose me to the loss of the Whole. I waited some time to pick up a Frank but it is not material as all these Expences must necessarily fall upon me. I am Dear Sir

your most obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
