Fludyer Street NÂº 21 12 May 1779

Dear Sir

I have had a pretty Long Conversation this Morning with Lord Cornwallis. Part of my Intention was to give him the Best Impression I coud of our Friend P. Ferguson & both for that & Other Purposes as I have an Apprehension that The Chief Command may devolve on His Lordship I wish to show him P: Fergusons Sketches & last letter to me: but in Strict Confidence. If you Approve of this be so good as send  me the Papers. I have promised Lord Cornwallis to see him again before he sets out. He has Understanding & Temper, that with a Proper Assortment of Officers to Form His Family [xxx], may do most Valuable things for this Countrey in the Present Situation of Affairs. I have already told him so much, & mean to continue the Subject, a Freedom which he takes in the best Part imaginable.

I am Dear Sir Most Respectfully & Affectionately yours

Adam Ferguson
