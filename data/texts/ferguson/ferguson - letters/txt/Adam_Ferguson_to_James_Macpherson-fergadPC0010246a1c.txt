Edinburgh 6 August 1780

My Dear Sir,

Our Friend Cl having made part of his Tour will inform you by this Express of the Particulars. I wrote you by successive Posts last week what occurred here. You will judge how far the matter can be carryed with any Credit of Adn or Advantage to the private Party.

At C. General Skenes Friends have acquitted themselves in a Manner that Deserves the Protection of G.. At St. A. no encouragement.

At D —  the Whole decided against us And in this the adherents of D: & of the D of A are probably Agreed.

At P: — Leading men by our accounts not Engaged: but Letters to Neighbouring Gentlemen  will not be Sufficient, & you will consider in what manner & through what Channel the Patronage of G. & the Respect that is due to it can be employed.

As to the L — A— who is supposed to speak the language of Administration is Silent this Bussiness becomes Proportionally Difficult. Is there any considerable thing in Dependence that can be given through the Proper Channel.

If P —  with C —  could be Secured then CC could afford to Strugle hard for a 3d & do as much as he ever meant to do for the whole Object. But without this the affair seems Desperate and a handsome Retreat is all that can be Effected, for the Credit of A —  as well as his own.

D —  is exceedingly Popular. Every man of us disposed to wish him  personnally well. It is painful to be against him upon any Other Idea than that his Seat must be disposed ofa to some body else if not to us.

Pray Answer by express and with as little loss of Time as circumstances will Allow.
