I had a letter some time ago from Mr McKenzie in which he told me that My Lord Bute, for Particular reasons, wished that he coud give the Name of Mr Linds office of Conservator to a friend, securing to Mr Lind the full Emoluments of the office during Life. My Indisposition has hindered my proposing the Affair to him; & as I am Still confined & unwilling to delay it any Longer, you will please wait on Mr Lind with my Compliments & let him know from me that his agreeing to resign upon entire Security of his having the Income of his office during Life, woud be Obliging to My Lord Bute & that the reasons which oblige me not to delay the matter till I coud have the pleasure of seeing him myself make me likewise wish to know his Mind upon it as soon as his conveniency will permit.
