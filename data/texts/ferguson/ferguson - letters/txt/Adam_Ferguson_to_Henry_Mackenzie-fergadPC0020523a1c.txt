[St Andrews, June 1812]

‘I happened once to have occasion for £200. John Home told me he had £200 more than he had immediate use for, and he lent it me upon my note of hand. Soon after, having received some money, I remitted to my agent at London this £200, with the interest due upon it, with directions to pay it to Mr. Home, in discharge of my debt. My agent paid him the money, and begged  to have up my note. He said he could not recollect any thing of a note, but he would look for it when he went to Scotland. The circumstance was forgotten by us both for several years, when at last, having married and got a family, I began to think that it was possible the note might appear against my children after both our deaths; and I wrote to Mr. Home, requesting, that if he had not found the note, he would write a letter to me, acknowledging that the debt had been paid, and that the note, if it appeared, should be of no avail against me or my heirs.

I had a letter from my friend in reply, saying, that to talk of finding any such note among his papers, was like talking of finding the lost Books of Livy; but he gave the acknowledgement in the letter, in what he conceived the most proper terms, though perhaps in terms too poetical to be good in law. If ever the note appears, said his letter, it will be of no use, excepting to shew what a foolish, thoughtless, inattentive fellow I am’.
