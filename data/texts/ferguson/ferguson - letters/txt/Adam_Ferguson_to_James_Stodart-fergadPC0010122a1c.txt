Blackheath Aprile 21st 
1775



My Lord

I have heard with much Surprise and concern of a ResolutionÂ  of the Town Council to Vacate my office in the College at the end of a session, in which my place had been, with their own permission & with the approbation of the Publick, Supplyed by one of my Colleagues. After having Served fifteen years, & I flattered myself without any discredit to the University I trusted that I had no reason to apprehend the Patrons of it woud attempt to deprive me of my Professorship uncalled & unheard. The Interest which I have at stake made me wish to be indulged with leave of Absence for one  Session longer. Such an Indulgence had been granted to one of my predecessors & is now granted by the first University in Britain to one of its members. If it had been refused to me I might have felt the Severity of being commanded to forego an Emolument which a few months longer woud have Secured to my Family: but certainly shoud have acquiesced in the most respectfull manner. I shoud not however have troubled your Lordship at present on this Subject; if I had not heard that I am accused of having neglected to give the Town Council proper Intimation of the circumstances that were likely to detain me Abroad. I left Edinburgh without knowing precisely how long I might be Absent. When my Prospects became less uncertain I was at a great Disstance, foresaw a change of Magistracy & was therefore desirous to commit the Official Communication of my Affairs to a friend who was present & who coud judge of the  properest method of Conducting them. Nor had I any Surmise till within these two days that any circumstance in this matter had exposed me to blame or censure.

I am still Ignorant of Particulars, & whatever misstakes may have been committed by my friends or Myself I hope that your Lordship and every Gentleman in the Magistracy will upon recollection think me incapable of any intended neglect, And that you will believe me to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
