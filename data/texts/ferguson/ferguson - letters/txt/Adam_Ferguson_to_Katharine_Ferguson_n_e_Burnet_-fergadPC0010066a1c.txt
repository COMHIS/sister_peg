Edinburgh Sept. 22, 1766

My Lovely Katie,

Your letter is the most pleasant I ever received. Doctor Black and I shall be at Aberdeen the second of October in the fore-noon. In the evening, about five o'clock, I expect that you will be ready with a clergyman to put over our ceremony, that I may not be detained in the place where you are without seeing you.

I was to have written your father about some particulars either forgotten or not explained in my last. Be so good as tell him that my residence here is in the West Kirk parish; that is the designation to be put in any certificate of proclamation. Let him read this, that he may write me in what parish my dear Katie lives, if there be any distinction of parishes at Aberdeen. I will send him a scroll of the paper I mentioned in a post or two, for it requires so much time, it seems, to draw it up. I shall write to Doctor Black by this post to fix his coming here, and I hope that we shall keep our appointment most punctually. Till then and for ever more, my dear Kate, I am passionately yours,

Adam Ferguson
