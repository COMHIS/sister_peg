London, March 10th 1779

My Lord,

I should have been to wait on your Lordship with the inclosed Papers if I were not confined by the Remains of a Smart Fit of a Feaver I had in the End of last week. The Person to whom they relate & who means to present them to Your Lordship has I believe stated the Facts very fairly & will probably obtain your Lordships Pardon for this Trouble. He flattered himself that His Memorial was  to have been presented to Lord North by Mr Mc Donald to whom he has long been known but is dissappointed by Mr McDonalds being gone as he informs me to the Countrey for Some weeks.

He tells me he had the Honour of being presented to Your Lordship in America & has pressed me very earnestly to Sollicit your Protection in his application for some relief to his present difficulties. Your Name in any way Accompanying these Papers to the Minister may procure him some Attention & he will probably leave them for your Consideration. The Patronage of Disstressed Americans is not at present a Station of Pleasure: but times may change.

The few Letters I have received from  New York by the last Packet confirm the former favourable Accounts & are summd up by saying that The Congress are Allarmd and dissunited.

I have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect My Lord your Lordships most Obliged & most obedient humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

To The Earl of Carlisle
