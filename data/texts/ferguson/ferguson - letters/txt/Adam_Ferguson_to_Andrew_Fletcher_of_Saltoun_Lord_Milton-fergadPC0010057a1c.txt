Castle Hill Febry 18th 1764

My Lord

I have drawn out & enclosed the Scroll of such a Paragraph as your Lordship perhaps will think proper to insert in your letter to the Ld P:S: relating to Coll. Fletchers Affair. It may proceed or follow what relations are to be sent of the Perthshire election.

I have likewise inclosed inclosed a short memorandum of the Proposal I mentioned relating to the College & am with the greatest Respect.

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obedient & most 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
