My Dear Carlyle

I join with this whole house in thanking Mrs Carlyle & you for the Boon of your Bun. I have been co[n]fined above three weeks by a Scald in my heels at first neglected but now an Obstinate Sore which will take time to remove. It not only Confines me but makes every motion and every posture uneasy.

James tells me there was a full attendance of all the militia men now under Ballot. But such is the effect of the Law that not one proposed to serve otherwise than by Substitute; & the Poorest Shepherd Boy proposes to spend the earnings of a whole life to procure a Substitute rather than enlist for an indefinite time for a Militia man. James and I are agreed if Substitutes  are not to be found he is to serve And he is the only one who will do so quasi willingly. But in these times every man must be military whatever else he may be.

Europe I see is to be again in a blaze of War greater than ever. God grant the fire Ball of France may break in the Scuffle. The Catastrophe of Greenfield is Afflicting beyond measure. To say that it is surprising is nothing; for such a thing certainly never entered into the head of any one to Conceive. It is miserable that no friend could interpose in time to save him: but what is to be done with Insanity for such it must have been of some kind or Other. For a Man to be convicted of eating turd when he not only had every Sort of precious food but also exposed himself to the gallows for what he did, is wonderful. I am Obliged to you for relieving me from the perplexity which  vague reports would have caused me.

My fingers are so cold & I write in so uneasy a Posture that I doubt your being able to read my letter & think it best to have done. I am with best respects to Mrs Carlyle.

your most 
Affectionate humble Servant
