London, 16 June 1775

Sr

My Lord Chesterfield was pleased to show me a Note from you to His Lordship desiring to know whether I wished to have any thing in writing from The Duke of Chandos and yourself; as it is determined that I am not to go abroad with Lord Chesterfield and that the Commencement of my Successors Sallary is fast approaching. In order to discharge me from my Attendance on Lord Chesterfield; I am advised that directions in writing from both his Present and late Guardians will be necessary. You will Judge of the terms Proper for such a writing, and whether I shou'd ask the late Guardians to put their names to the same Paper, or apply to them separately for their concurrence. As I conclude from your Letter to Lord Chesterfield that the £400 a year appointed for me during my Attendance on his Lordship is to cease on the 24th Instant, It is proper to inform you that I have received no payments by Advance and that £100 will be due to me at Midsummer for the Quarter that has passed from Lady Day. It is likewise material for me to know to whom and at what terms I am to apply for the Payment of the £200 a year settled upon me during my Life. Uncertainty on this point may Subject me to inconvenience as I have allotted to a Substitute all the Profits of my office at Edinburgh untill the Commencement of next winter Term, and shall not be entitled to receive any Sallary for that office before Whitsunday next year.

I have also to inform you, that when on my Way to Geneva last year I understood from Sr George Savile that the expences of that Journey were to be allowed me. I was detained about ten days at London waiting for instructions from My Lord Chestefields Guardians and about as long at Paris waiting for a Pass by which means the whole expence amounted to £85. I have the honour to be with the greatest respect etc

Adam Ferguson

I shall remain in Town till the Morrow Morning and shall wait upon you if you desire it.
