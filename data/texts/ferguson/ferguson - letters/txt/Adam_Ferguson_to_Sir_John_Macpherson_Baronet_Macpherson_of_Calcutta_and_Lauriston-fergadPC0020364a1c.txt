Edinburgh 24th May 1795

My Dear Friend

I wrote to you a Post or two ago to request your Interposition with the Duke of Queensberry to be appointed Keeper of His Graces deserted Castle of Nydpath, as The King appoints keepers of that Sort without a Salary: but instead of saying more on that Subject I write now to request that you will renew your Thanks to Mr Mc Kenzie of seaforth for his kindness to my Son Joseph. He paid for his Lieutenancy & now would be glad to pay for a higher step which he mentions as likely to go in Regiment.

If so it will be a favour of Mr Mc Kenzie or whoever reports in the matter allow my Son to come on in his Turn for whatever may be going by purchase or Otherwise. You see that a long Silence is soon broken when any thing is to be got by it. I am My Dear Friend yours

most Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
