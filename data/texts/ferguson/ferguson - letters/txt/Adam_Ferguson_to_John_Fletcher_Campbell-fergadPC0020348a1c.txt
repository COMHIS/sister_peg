Dear Sir

I have notice of My Sons Josephs appointment a Cadet of Artillery to India & I feel a necessity of accompanying him to London that he may either take his passage in the Ships of this Season, or take benefit of the leave given by the Court of Directors to remain at Woolwich or some other Academy for a year the better to qualify him for the Service. I shall carry my Manuscript with me & so relieve you for the present of farther wading thro it. I think to be gone tomorrow or next day.

I am Dr Sir yours most affectionately

Adam Ferguson
