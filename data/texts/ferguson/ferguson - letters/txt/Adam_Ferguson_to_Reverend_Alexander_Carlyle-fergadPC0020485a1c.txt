My Dear Carlyle

To answer as you desire by return of the Post I by no means feel bold enough to undertake for a Journey to Arniston in the course of a week from the present date. I have a very great desire to see My Lord Chief Baron but there are at present so many insurmountable difficulties that I must positively defer till I can find His Lordship at Edr. We are taken short here in the middle of Harvest with rainy and most Boisterous weather. There is not a Standing Stook to be seen but all leveld with the ground And the Pease sheaves are bickering over the Country at the Rate of ten miles an hour. As I have neither men nor horses but what the little farm requires the farm is my master and I cannot budge without its leave. Besides I do not know any safe Road from hence to Arniston but by Edr or at least Lasswaid.

You will make  my excuse for the present to My Lord Chief Baron. In going to Edr I but go from one little home to another & that is all I am fit for in the rest of My Life. You Youth have no idea of the bucklings I require Against Cold by day & Cramps by Night; and tho I envy your Ignorance, hope you never will know better from your own experience at least. I am really not a fit guest for any Gentlemans house above the rank of an Innkeeper. There are great preparations in this County for a Ball tomorrow, And a fine saddle I am told preparing to be run for by horses, which have been in Cart or Plough every working day for Six Months past: but I doubt my infirmities will keep me at Home. Here all join in best respects to Mrs Carlyle & yourself. I mentioned my wish for a Gardiner to you that is a fellow who would do any thing he is bid including digging & planting &c &c

Yours most Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
