Dear Sir

I have had notice from my Son of the Copper plates being come & have desired him to put them into your hands with my request to have some proof impressions as soon as convenient. That we may consider what is necessary or may be done for their improvement & this I am perswaded you will think right. We are proceeding as you probably know at the press. And I am much allarmed at the probable size or [xxx] of our Volumes if condensed into four. A lumpy Octavo is of all forms the most inconvenient to me & I break down some of my books into separate vol's. I should earnestly wish if it can be done without great inconvenience that our book could be divided into six Vol. s. The [xxx] Stitched should be nearly the same & if more when bound I shoud hope the  buyer would be reconciled on account of the more convenient & portable form. I make these remarks to have them considered before the first separation of a Vol. And you will determine what should be done. I am

Dear Sir 
your most obedt and 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
