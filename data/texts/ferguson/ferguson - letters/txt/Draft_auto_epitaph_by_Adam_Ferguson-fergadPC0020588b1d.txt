We whose Bones are buried here 
have trod like you this Stage of Earth 
And seen these works of God from 
Earth to Heaven. The Sight is 
Glorious it is now your Turn Enjoy 
it and be glad: But know yourselves 
Among the Chief for whom the Plan 
is laid. The [xxx] Parent consigns 
his Child to School that he may learn 
what fits him for his Station and 
the Course he has to run. What has 
The Almighty Parent done for you 
That he has done for I rear & every 
living Creature. They are made to 
Spring from Seed & set a growing 
you are made to Spring from 
Ignorance a set a learning. All the 
World is a School to you. For 
This occasions are presented to [xxx] 
your best affections to which your 
Faculties & call forth your Powers: 
Where is this to End or When [xxx] 
Should it end? There is more than 
you can ever learning your life & 
Being is progressive than (one illegible word) 
buried (reading conjectural) it we cease. The [xxx] that is 
Aged moulders into the [xxx].
