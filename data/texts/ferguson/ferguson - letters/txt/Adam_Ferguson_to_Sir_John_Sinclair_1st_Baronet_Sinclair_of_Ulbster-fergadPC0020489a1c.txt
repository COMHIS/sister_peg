Hallyards near Peebles Octr 24th 1803

My Dear Sir

I have a kind hint on the back of a letter from Sir Jn McPherson franked by you; that the Answer might go through your hands also. I accordingly take the benefit of this Hint & the Rather that it gives me an opportunity without attempting an adequate Return to the great dispatch with which you honoured me too many months ago, to deprecate your contempt of me for having so long failed in that matter. This failure at least may inform you that I am in fact superannuated & so far one of your Pets which you wish to preserve as long as possible. It is to be hoped that some of them are of more use than I am otherwise you may e'en let them go in course. Here are three of us born the same year Viz. 1723.  There is little difference in our Appearance only that I am the least weather beatten of the Three. I have had the advantage of exemption from Toil & they till of late have had the advantage of Sobriety: But there is another twelve years older than we are having been born in 1712, A Peasant of this Parish his Sobriety you need not doubt. The World for ought he has seen of it may not be twelve Miles broad or long: but he has been distinguished through Life for Vivacity, is Veridick open Spoken & quoted for bon mots. He was of a good Aspect & Stature: but is now blind & much Shrunk, goes through his usual haunts without any assistance or guide is even offended at being offered any. I see as well as you do of a dark night he said to me, & why may not I find my way as well as you do. They tell me I have lived long: but it is just a GliffÂ .

I have often thought to get our Minister to Answer all your Queries respecting this Person: but you know the Consequence of Procrastination after four Score. I have the honour to be

My Dear Sir 
your obedient humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
