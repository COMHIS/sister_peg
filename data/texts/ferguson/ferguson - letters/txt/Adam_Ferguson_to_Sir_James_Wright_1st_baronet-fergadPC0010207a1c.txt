London March 31, 1779

Sir,

I am commanded by His Majestys Commissioners appointed in Pursuance of An Act of Parliament passed in the eighteenth year of His Majestys Reign, to treat consult & Agree upon the means of quieting the Dissorders now Subsisting in North America, to inform you, that upon the Appointment of Lieut. Coll. Archibald Campbell to Command a Body of His Majestys Forces in the Province of Georgia it was thought expedient at the same time to furnish him with a Commission of Civil Governour & Commander in Chief within the said Province, to be produced & carried into execution by him if he should find a reasonable prospect of being able to restore & preserve the Civil Government of Georgia under the Authority of the King. But that if the Situation of affairs should prevent his Acting under this Appointment he should preserve it carefully within his own Custody till he could Deliver it to His Majestys Principal Secretary of State to be Cancelled.

That this Provisional Appointment of Lieut. Coll. Archibald Campbell may not in any Way obstruct your Return to the Government of Georgia to which you were formerly Appointed by  his Majesty the Commissioners have thought Proper by the Inclosed Commission to you to revoke & Annul that which they granted at New York to Lieut. Coll. Campbell. But, if as they have reason to expect you should not have occasion to Act under their Appointment it is their Intention & desire that the Instrument herewith sent appointing you Governour & Commander in Chief in the Province of Georgia should be Suppressed & Cancelled.

I have the honour to be with great Respect, Sir, your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
