Dear Sir

As I perceive that something must have happened to prevent my Manuscript going to the Press at the time you proposed; I shall be glad to know the present State of it & when I may expect a proof sheet, as I must take care not to be out of the Way during any part of the bussiness. I have intimation of Leave to dedicate to the King & shall in due time send you the Form in which I mean to profit by it. The fifth and Sixth books are under review & correction. Least a fit opportunity should not offer to send the whole at once I shall have a Copy  taken to go in separate Packets by the Post.

Be so good as advise me what is to be done in case the Dissolution of Parliament which is so much talked of should not take place. And whether we may trust to the Franks of the Post masters during the interval of Parliaments. I have set one of our Artists here to work in Sketching some Maps, but I find it difficult to give both the general views & the Particular Scenes which I wish for; you shall know what occurs in the progress of the bussiness. I most sincerely wish you joy of your late news from the west Indies. They may help us to procure Friends or to make peace with our Enemies. I would heap Mr Rodney with Rewards, not only for his own Sake, but as Voltair said of Mr Byngpour encourager les Autres. 

Here is miserable weather scarcely a day of Summer continual returns of east Wind & Rain. Your Friends of this Place are all well. I beg My Complts to Mr Strahan & Mr Cadel.

I am Dear Sir your most obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
