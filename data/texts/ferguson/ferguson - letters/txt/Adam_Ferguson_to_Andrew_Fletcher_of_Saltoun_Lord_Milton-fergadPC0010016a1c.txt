Groninguen Octr 9th 1756

My Lord

In my last I told your Lordship how far I had gone in setling Mr Fletcher here; & did not then think it necessary to wait for a return from your Lordship, Mr Fletcher was indeed then very melancholy but I was in hopes that might go off in a few days, it has however increased to such a degree that I cannot think of leaving him so soon as I proposed, without even a Servant who in case of further Changes, might at least procure him the offices of Humanity. I am very well aware what your Lordship must feel from these appearances for my own disstress is beyond expression. I cannot for[e]see what I may be obliged to do before I can hear from your Lordship, perhaps to return to Brittain, where a properer place might be found for Mr Fletcher till his melancholy goes off, than any here, he is at present disqualified by it for doing any thing. I am hurryed in writing this as the Post is just going away & I was not able to determine myself what to propose  to your Lordship sooner. I feel great uneasiness in a Situation Subject to blame without advice or Authority from those who shoud direct me. Your Lordship will please to direct for me (Au Parlament d'Angleterre a Groningue) or to the Care of Mr Crawfurd at Rotterdam.

I am My Lord 
with great Respect 
your Lordships 
most Ob't humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
