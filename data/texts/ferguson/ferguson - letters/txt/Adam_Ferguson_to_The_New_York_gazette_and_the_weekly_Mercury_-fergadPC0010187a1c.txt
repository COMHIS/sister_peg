New York, 28th Sept. 1778

Having received the following letter from Governor Johnstone at his departure for England, I think it my duty to fulfil his intention by publishing it for the satisfaction of those who may desire to know the reasons that have induced him to suspend any particular discussion of the charge, on which a late resolution of the Congress, respecting himself, is founded. The intimation contained in this letter will, in the mind of every person in any degree acquainted with his character, have its proper effects; altho' I am, both by his injunction and by the considerations he mentions, restrained, at present, from giving any particular account of the evidence intrusted to me.
