Parliament Street, March 23, 1776

Sir,

It was my duty to have thanked you sooner for your letter, and the very masterly and judicious paper which accompanied it, and which I have read with great attention and pleasure. Dr Price's pamphlet has been circulated with the same zeal that the Methodists circulate their manuals and practices of piety. Like base coin struck in times of disorder and confusion, it has had a value and a currency in the world which no other times could have given it. In that respect he deserves and demands what neither the weight of his arguments or the accuracy of his knowledge entitle him to expect — an answer from a good and able writer. I have ordered the observations to be printed by Mr Strahan, without its being known who is the author of them. I am happy of having this opportunity of corresponding with Professor Ferguson; and if idem sentire de republica  be the basis of friendship, I can very fairly pretend to yours; for I entirely concur with you in your noble sentiment, that the great object is to lay the demon of discord on both sides of the ocean; and I am, dear Sir, with great regard and esteem, your very faithful, humble servant,

Grey Cooper
