Edinburgh, September 20th, 1766

My Dear Katy,

I have received a letter from your father, and am happy that no difficulty, either real or imaginary, has cast up on any quarter. It is with the utmost tenderness and joy that I think of you now as my own, and the happiest acquisition I ever made. As many circumstances at present make time very valuable to me, I venture to write to your father about every particular, and request him to settle matters so as to suit my present engagements. My mind is greatly to abridge formalities and points of ceremony. I like them not on any occasion, but when the heart is most of all affected and moved, they are impertinent to a degree of abomination will write no more at present, as I find I have my words to seek for.

I have been in the country all day, and have hurried to town in order to write your father. I only desire that you will make no difficultys about trifles. — I am, with the most affectionate regard, my dear Kate, yours

I had written ‘Lothingness’, but erased it, perhaps feeling a little unhappy about the etymology of that word.
