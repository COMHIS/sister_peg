Dartford Aprile 1st 1774

Dear Sir

I was Surprised to find that no Copys of the Second Edition of my Institutes had been sent to London. In order to have a Copy to carry abroad with me I have been Obliged to Borrow from Sr John Pringle one which I gave him last Summer at Edinburgh. I must now beg the Favour that you will take the first opportunity to replace it & send him on my Acc't at least two Copys. Mr John Home likewise wants to have some Copys Sent him & this you may do by the Waggon. It is likewise called for in the Shops. I write in great hurry on my way to Dover. And Am Dear Sr your most Obedient humble Servant
