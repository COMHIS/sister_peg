St Andrews Febry 26th 1812

My Dear Sir

I have just learned by a letter from my Seaman John that I am now possessed of your kindness and friendship to this Seaman as formerly to his Elder Brother and I would do more if I could than hasten in this way to Acknowledge it but I despair of being able to fulfill your kind intentions by attempting to write a letter of solicitation to His Grace the Duke of Buccleugh. The little access I personally had to his Noble Father would not justify any such liberty. I should by that means be known to his Grace together with my Son as a Bore for life this word is possibly now out of fashion but it was used in my time to Signify any person or thing that was carefully shunned forever. That man was a Bore who repeatedly teased you with long visits and dryed up the source of every agreeable  conversation by continual returns to some tiresome Matter in which he was concerned- he was called in Italian Siccatore a name more easily understood from its derivation than Bore which owed its meaning to the application alone.

The handwriting is in another hand than Ferguson's, apparently Sir Adam's. Just the signature, very tremulous, is in Ferguson's hand.

Unless therefore you think yourself Warranted to recommend our Seaman to the Duke of Buccleughs notice as a young man of Merit to be received occasionally into his Graces Company and unless his Grace should find him so upon tryal I should despair of any advantage to be gained by a connection formed in the Character of a Bore. His Grace's Father I had occasion to observe had some predilection for the Character of a Seaman — it is open — it is Candid — it is Manly and not to be shaken [by] trifling difficulties and therefore acceptable as a Companion to his Grace.

You will pardon any  thing that is wrong in this Letter and believe me to be though little accustomed to dictate what others are to write.

Most truely your obliged 
and affectionate 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
