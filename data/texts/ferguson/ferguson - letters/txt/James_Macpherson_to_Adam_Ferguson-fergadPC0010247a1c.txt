London August 9th 1780

My dear Sir

I received both your letters; and immediately applied. Lord Sandwich is out of town; as soon as he returns, which will be in a day or two, this letter to Purei  will be sent. Mr Drummond will, at the same time, write to Provost Nairne. Assurances are given to me that every place vacant, or to be vacant, in any or all the Cities will be given to C.C.'s recommendation, and to his only.

This matter is fixed; and assurances may be accordingly given. Blank commissions, or warrants, are out of rule and are, therefore, out of the Question. We knew, before hand, of the Lord Advocate's predilections; but as he cannot be a friend, we have reason to think he will not be an enemy. An Express, as you mention, will, very probably, be sent with the letters. Mr Harley's letter, or answer, is not yet arrived; as he is in Herefordshire ——— 

yours &c &c &c
