Munich 5 October 1793

Dear Sir

Finding myself here at Munich past the Michaelmas Term a[nd] known to Mr Walpole the King's Minister, I have thought it a good opportunity to Obtain the within Attestation which I hope will entitle you to receive my last half years Annuity from Lord Chesterfield's Banker. If so you will please give notice to My Son Adam Ferguson Writer in South Castle Street New Town Edinburgh, who has a Factory a[nd] full powers of Attorney from me so that his draft will be to you a discharge or receit equal to mine. I have found travelling in this country sometimes tedious and with ill acommodation but so healthy as to be fit to restore invalids. The Elector mentioned yesterday at his Levee that the King of Prussia has declared his intention to Winter at Berlin. And there is a Report that the Emperor is about to set out from Vienna to Brussels. What all this portends you will guess. I am

Dear Sir your most obedient humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

James Chalmers Esqu.
