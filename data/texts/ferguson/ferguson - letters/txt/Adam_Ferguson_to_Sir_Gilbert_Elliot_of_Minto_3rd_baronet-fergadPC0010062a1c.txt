Lauriston, July 30th 
1766



Dear Sir

I set out for the Highlands tomorrow morning with the Mr Grevilles. I wished to see you that I might receive my Manuscript & any remarks you have taken the trouble to make. If you have any that can be put in writing without too much trouble I beg that you will deliver them with the Book itself to Mr Russell the Professor of Natural Philosophy, who will call or send to you for it. I have informed him of my intentions & entrusted him with any negotiations that may arise with Booksellers in my Absence.

I am with the greatest Respect 
Dear Sir 
your most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
