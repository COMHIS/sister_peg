Argyle Square 24 Decr 1783

Dear Carlyle

your Letter has put me into such a Flutter, that I dont know what to Answer to it. Suffice it, for the present, to say [th]at having been tempted on Friday last to venture through the Storm of an Edr Sedan Chair to dine with Sir James Grant where I drank Cannongate Water & fed up Country Potatoes Turnips & Cabbages was put to bed at night in a fever [which con]tinued ill for eight & forty hours [xxx xxx] then what would happen if I [should?] [xxx xxx] Suffer myself to be driven to [Muss]elburgh by your desires.  The Proposal makes me Shudder, and its coming from you makes my blood run Cold. If you have any Sinister intentions on my Life; I pray you may have a Sight of your Sins, & be forgiven: but such round about ways are not necessary; yo[u] need not take a Hammer to break an Egg, as the Saying is. You have only, the first time you Come to Town, to bring a Pair of Bellows in your Pocket & blow the Smallest blast into any Cor[ner] of Argyle Square, my bussiness is [xxx] your Blood thirsty designs a[ccom]plished. And so no more at this [xxx xxx] but like Compliments from my [xxx] Spouse who feeds on decoction of [xxx] & calls it Tea.

yours &c 
A.F.
