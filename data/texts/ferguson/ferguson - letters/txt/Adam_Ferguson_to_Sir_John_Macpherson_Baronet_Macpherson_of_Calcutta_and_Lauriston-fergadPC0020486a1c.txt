My Dear Friend

I am at least two letters in your debt & yet find myself in a fair way to be waiting for a third without considering that at my time of Life there should be some evidence of experience & fact of my being alive to endure any one to trust matters of consequence under my address. The Fact then is that I am alive & will be happy on any occasion that may make what I know of your merits the topic of discourse. As to effects they may be little:but that is not what I have to Answer for. You have probably by this time seen your Friend Otto on Board & I am sorry for it as I believe he is averse to Mischief. I flattered myself once that his Principal  was so likewise: but now see that the mountain torrent of Idiotical Ambition is too Strong for any reason. What the Devil Inducement can Master Buonaparte have to be hasten[ing] all Europe under Despotism to the Ruin of France as well as the Rest & the Suppression of every Spark of Political Life or Ingenuity in the world. I trust we are to see an Age of Glory not of degradation for this Countrey. I pray you to Congratulate your Friends in Administration on the State of Political Controversy. They have got two or three excellent Props. Their own good Intentions. The attack of Grenvilles And the Support of Fox & Sherridan with all the Unshackled Artillery of publick expedience And good Sense. I long to hear from you & am &c &c

A.F.
