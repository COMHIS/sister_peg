My Dear Friend

if your bussiness be any way relaxed I pray you to come here, it is ridiculous to wait the final Settlement of Order either here or elsewhere.

The best that can be said even of the Universe itself or any Created thing is that it is Coming into order. And so are my Chairs tables & Books &c &c but if you were here we should not give ourselves any trouble about them. I have been just now writing a Long Letter to your Friend Sr William Pulteny & have told him of your being at Edr: but I had better be trying as I now do to bring you here without loss of time or if that be more Convenient to Summon me to Edinburgh. I am My Dear Friend

your most Affectionate 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
