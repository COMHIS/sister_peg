London 2 May 1776

My Dear Adam

Smith would inform you [xxx] of our condition & Ninewells a second time to whom David wrote upon the road. I deferred my despatch till we should reach the place which we did last night in much better plight than any body expected. Sir John Pringle is of opinion that David will move but he has taken till to morrow to deliver his Decisions & Observations for the proceedings of the Patient. David in reality mended every day  not that he had not some changes for the first two hundred miles, & a [xxx] better day & a [xxx] but for the last six days. He went on without any back going. About three days before we gott to London Colen came from Pulteny [xxx] to [xxx] and told me with great joy that Mr. Hume was certainly going to be well for that he complained of cold & was to sleep that night with an additional covering covering which he did & continued to do. This Mr Colen Mr David and I agree to be a remarkable good sign.  David observed that he was beginning to be like other people. If I can guess, Pringle will send him to Bath & Bristol for he seems determined not to leave Great Britain. I shall write you again to morrow. I [xxx] pass my time more agreeably than with David upon the road, nor did I ever see him better company. Mr Colen is positive that if I had not joined him he would have turned back. As to that I cannot say, but as Fleutcher says of the Lord that I did him no evil.

I am with my compliments to Mrs Ferguson Dear Adam ever yours
