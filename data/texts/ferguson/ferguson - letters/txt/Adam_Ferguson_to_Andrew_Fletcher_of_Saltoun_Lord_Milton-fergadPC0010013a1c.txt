Harwich, Septr 18th 1756

My Lord

We arrived here yesterday morning without having met with any interruption or uneasiness on the Road, but we are likely to meet with some hinderance here, the Wind has been contrary all day yesterday & continues so to day, if it comes more favourable a Packet will sail this afternoon, but there is at present litle appearance of it, as the Wind seems to be set in, and blows hard. If we are detained here to another Post day, I will write your Lordship again from this place.

The expence to Harwich amounts to About Nineteen Guineas. I have not yet delivered your Lordships letter to Mr Fletcher, & I believe it will come more properly when the hurry and dissipation of his Journey is over.

I am with great respect 
your Lordships 
Most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
