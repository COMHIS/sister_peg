Edinburgh Decr 16, 1777

My Lord

I sometime ago communicated to my Agent at London the Contents of your Lordships letter on the Subject of what passed with My Lord Chesterfield here concerning my Annuity. And desired him to Consult with your Lordships man of bussiness on any steps that might be taken relating to that affair. I do not however find that any thing has been done, And in this state of suspence wish to know your Lordships opinion whether I may draw upon Lord Chesterfields Banker as his Lordship directed for Â£200 at Christmas to account of the Claim which he has acknowledged altho' he has not yet settled the mode of Securing it & of Relieving the your Lordship of obligations contracted on his Account.

I am extremely happy to hear of the Well fare of your Lordships Family. I had the pleasure to see My Lord Hadington & Lord Binnie here a few days ago. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obliged & most 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
