London 18th May 1779

Sir

Upon a Representation made by some of the Merchants of London trading to New York & Rhode Island; that the Commissioners of His Majestys Customs had declined clearing out any Goods for those Ports, as the Term limited for the Operation of the Proclamations issued for opening that Trade (being to the 1st of June 1779) must be expired before such Goods could Arrive at New York or Rhode Island; I am Commanded by their Excellencies His Majestys Commissioners appointed to treat &c of the means of quieting the Dissorders in America, to transmit the inclosed Copies of their Proclamations of the 22d April to continue in Force to the 1st of Decr 1779 their Former Proclamations relating to the Trade of New York & New Port in Rhode Island, & which were otherwise about to expire on the 1st of June; In order that these Instruments may if thought proper be communicated by the Lords Commissioners of The Treasury to His Majestys Board of Customs.

I have the Honour to be 
with great respect 
Sir your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
