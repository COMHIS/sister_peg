My Lord

I Understand Mr Home has been proposing Schemes for my Advantage in Scotland, & he has informed me of the manner in which your Lordship was pleased to receive them. I am very much affected with such proofs of your Lordships remembrance & Friendship, & whatever be the consequence can never forget the Respect & Gratitude which my treatment has at all times inspired me with. I have written to Mr Home on the Subject of his proposals, I am sorry the Affair is of a Nature to give trouble to my friends, & know he is Sanguine about every thing where friendship is concerned. You will be able to Judge how far Mr Abercrombie can be brought to reasonable terms, & I Shall have a particular Satisfaction in following any determination your Lordship is pleased to take the trouble of making for me.

I have not heard of Mr Kinloch since he went to Bath, he was then looking well, but his Spirits a little depressed with the apprehension of his remaining complaint. I have some thoughts of getting in to the Stage Coach & going down for some days to see how he does. I wish your Lordship Joy of the Victory on the Rhine but need not trouble you with the Accounts talked of here as you will be better informed.

I am With the most Sincere Respect 
& Affection 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most faithful & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
