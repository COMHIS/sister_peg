My Lord

I have written this line, in case I should miss your Lordship; I dont know whither it is proper to trouble you about Stamp Masters. But I have a sister who is married to a man of the name of Wilkie at Coupar in Angus who some years ago was appointed Joint Stamp Master with one   Menzies who being unable for the Bussiness on account of his Age only retained the Sellary and so much of the bussiness as was to be done in the Town itself, Whilst it was understood that my Brother in Law was to do the Rest & I think to succeed in the office: I have a letter from My sister telling me that they are very much alarmed by some steps which they hear have been taken to change the destination of the office in a favour of a person who it seems has married Menzies daughter. My Sisters Situation forces me, perhaps to tresspass on your Lordships Goodness. If it should  [xxx] come before the Trustees for the Linnen Manufacture your Lordships Protection here woud add most sensibly to the Obligations I ly under. & am

My Lord your Lordships most 
Humble & Affectionate Servant 
Adam Ferguson
