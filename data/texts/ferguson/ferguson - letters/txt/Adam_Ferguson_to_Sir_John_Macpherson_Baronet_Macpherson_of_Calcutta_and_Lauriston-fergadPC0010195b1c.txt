Hotel in Jermyn Street Tuesday Evening 22 December 1778

My Dear Friend

I did not advert that your letter required an Answer I had just written to Mrs Ferguson full of Anxiety about my not hearing from her for eight months past. I have just opened the Letter again to tell her how glad I am to receive her letter. I can say nothing about a place of Rest for a Day or two I have come like lightning from New York to Jermyn Street & have not had off my Cloaths for three nights. Charles Greville wished you & me to come to him this Evening at 8 O'Clock. Let me know what you propose to do perhaps it woud be Charitable to make an excuse for me & put off the  Party to another Night that I may Sleep however I will do what you please. If you can within an hour look in here, I shall be glad to see you for a Moment although we cannot just devour every Subject that may Arise till we have more Leisure.

I am My Dear Sir 
most affectionately yours 
Adam Ferguson
