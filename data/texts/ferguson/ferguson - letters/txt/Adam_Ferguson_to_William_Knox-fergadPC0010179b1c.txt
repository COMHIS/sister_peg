New York Septr 5th, 1778

Sir,

I am directed by His Majesty's Commissioners to inform You that they received your Letter of 3d June inclosing the Petition of Zebidiah Story of Newport Rhode Island shewing that the Petitioner having bought Flax, Seed, Staves, Mahogany and other Goods or Merchandize was desirous to export the Same in two Vessels to Great Britain or Ireland and humbly praying that it might be recommended to His Majesty's Commissioners to grant him the Relief requird. Soon after the Receipt of Your Letter with Copy of the above Petition, Newport Rhode Island was invested by a Rebel Force on the Landside and blocked up by the French Squadron by Sea. The Subsequent Attacks on the Place have been defeated but with some Loss of Ships that were destroyed to avoid their falling into the Enemy's hands.

There is not any particular Account what Share Mr Zebadiah Story may have had in this Loss. But if he be still in Possession  of Merchandize which he wishes to export it is the Purpose of His Majesty's Commissioners to give Relief in this and every similar Case as far as shall appear consistent with the State of His Majesty's Service by sea and Land.

I am with the greatest 
Regard 
Sir 
your most obedient and 
most 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
