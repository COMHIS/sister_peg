Whitehall, 9th Jan.ry 1779

Dear Sir,

Mr Eden has just now transmitted to me a Minute of Mr Smyth's which is of a very different Complexion from that which you understood to have been Sir Henry Clinton's Conduct towards him.

If you can give me any Information tending to corroborate or invalidate the one fact or the other, I should be obliged to you for it, as I much wish to send to Mr Smyth an Answer as soon as I can.

I am, 
Dear Sir, 
Your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Thos De Grey Junr









Doctor Ferguson
