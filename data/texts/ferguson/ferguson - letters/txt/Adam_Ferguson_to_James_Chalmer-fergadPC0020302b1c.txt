Edinburgh April 10th 
1784



Dear Sir

As there was little chance of my being in London & I forsaw the necessity of a transaction relating to my Book; I sent you the Copies annexed to my last although I did not clearly see what part you should take in the matter immediately. Even in Answer to your Letter I must proceed on Suppositions, which at this distance I cannot verify, & of which even on the Spot I should probably not be a Competent judge. If my Book has had its utmost sale, it would be very improper for me to grasp at a profit to the hurt of my Booksellers: But if the most profitable part of the Sale is yet to come either from the lasting demand for it or from their exertion when it becomes their absolute property, I ought not, in justice to my family, to forgo any part of the advantage, that is justly due to me. Messrs Strahan & Cadell have the reputation of fair &  liberal dealers, & I must continue to think they deserve it untill I have reason to think otherwise. Please to let them know that I wish to come to a definitive Bargain, & try on what terms they are willing to conclude the transaction. I am willing to accommodate them in deferring the term of payment hereafter as may be fit and reasonable. In other respects our Agreement of Febry 28. 1782 I think ought to be the basis.

As to the Evidence of their having performed the conditions of that egreement I must for the present suppose so, altho if the agreement were to be strictly fulfilled they would probably offer such Evidence as the case would admit of; what that evidence is I know not & must Submit to you & to them. I cannot entertain any doubt of their having taken the proper Steps to secure the copy right to whomsoever it shall be assigned: but as this is probably matter of record, you can  easily know it.

I ought probably to have mentioned in my last, that I mean my letters on this Subject to be confidential & Secret.

I am Dear Sir 
your most Obedient 
& most humble Serv't 
Adam Ferguson
