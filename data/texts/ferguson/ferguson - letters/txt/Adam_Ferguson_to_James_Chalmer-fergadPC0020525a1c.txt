[St Andrews] October 4, 1813

Dear Sir

you have the usual attestations on the other leaf of this paper.

I endeavoured to hasten the Miss Burnetts in denomination of their Agent supposeing their Annuity to be payable at this Term but have learned that it is not payable till Christmas so that they may proceed at leisure. I sent them a Copy of your last Letter and we must wait their pleasure.

I am Dear Sir your most Obedient & most Humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
