New Broad Street 30th Janry 1779

Sir

On Application to Sr Robert Pigott, I find that the only Method to get Liberty for My Goods & Vessel to come direct to England is by An Order from the Commander in Chief in America which  perhaps he may not think himself authorised to Grant. In that Case the only Remedy to Obtain that End will be a Proclamation by His Majesty's Commissioners for extending all the Advantages to Rhode Island that New York Reaps by their Proclamation a Considerable Quantity of Goods being at the Former Place, & cannot be shipt legally without the same Indulgence which Sir Robert Pigott thinks he ought also be allowed.

I remain with great Regard Sir your most Obedient Servant
