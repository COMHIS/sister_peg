My Dear Friend

I cannot rightly account for my Silence Some time past: Anxious untill I heard the India Bussiness was so far Settled; & since somewhat remiss; or rather averse to the Subjects, which we used to write about; & but for the two last copies* which you have sent me, I should have no heart to write now. These Copies I approve much. Your own from Calcutta was a proper Warning to the Direction at Home. What they ought to have been prepared for & what they ought to have done but they were a part of that very Publick from which you had no popularity to expect. Montesquieu Attempted to fix the Principles of different Governments & if he had touched on Mercantile Government, he would have said the Principle was L'Argent not publick but private Pocketting: with your Publick & Liberal Views you was neither to be Understood nor Considered. You do  not tell me what Sr G. Dallas was, at that time: but if my feelings of the Mass be the reverse of Admiration, his part compensates. A more manly friendly & Sensible letter I never read; I am not anxious about any Effect his Suggestions might have. You are, I trust, above any uneasiness of Fortune; & his Testimony is worth many Millions to a Mind that can enjoy itself. Give me some Comfort, I pray you on the state of publick affairs; I mean the War.

We engaged, without the possibility of an Object: but that of defending ourselves: Are we in a Condition to do so? Are we now to find out that the Strength of our Navy was Neglected; And the Enemy have only to Threaten us at home to be masters every where else. De Republica non DesperandumÂ  is for men in Active life. But for the Superannuated & Idle to be secure  is little better than Indifference. I am about closing my 82d year so I trust you will pardon a little peevishness.

Yours most Affectionately

Adam Ferguson
