My Dear Sir

This is to let you know that I called at Milton house some days ago to inquire whether you could do us the favour to meet the Poet Burns and some Others at Dinner here tomorrow. I had his works in my pocket to show you & still continue in the mind that he gives the most indubitable proofs of Genius, which I hope will be some inducement to your coming here tomorrow.

I write that this Letter may ly for your inspection any time you arrive whether tonight or tomorrow Morning. I have more than one Letter from Jn Home who has been Swearing to the Identity of a Packet  be carried from hence on My Account.

I am My Dear Sir with the greatest 
Respect your most Affectionate 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
