Edinburgh Novr 3d 1773

My Dear Sir

I have just received your letter by Coll. Campbell who being in haste has sent it with a very obliging Mess[age] & defers the pleasure of seeing him till his returne to this place about Christenmas. I have without a moments delay taken this paper & shall not think of any thing else till I have sent off a letter to you. Yours have all come safe at least do not refer to any more than I have received. I coud muster up some excuses for not writing: but mus[t] confess on recollection that the Principal cause has bee[n] a senseless habit of Procrastination. I sometimes waite[d] for one event & then for another. Some months of the long Silence passed even in expectation of seeing you in India & I had the womanish humour of wishing to surprise you: but of this you have heard as I guess from a letter of yours to Doctor Robertson and I need not to tell you how that matter went off, the wonder is that it ever  encreased a little since you heard of me.

Bell has got a little Brother about three year old & a Sister about eight months. The little boy has a good deal of Stuff in him, both attention and Vehemence. I begin to recommend him in Time & shall bequeath him your Friendship as the best part of his Inheritance.

His name is Adam & I shall call him McPherson too if you please. Mrs Ferguson & Bell Join in their be[st] Respects & acknowledgements for your new Present which was not landed when Coll. Campbell [le]ft London but they hope will come Safe. Mary too [w]ill have a share of it and thus you have a Catalogue of all my children. My demerits as a Correspondent [ha]s diminished the frequency of my Intercourse even [w]ith Charles Greville. His Father is dead within a few months. He will be in Parliament for the first time this winter. I have heard nothing directly from himself.

 I did not expect the Instrument was to have Magnanimity enough to behave properly to you. The Lustre he wished to assume required keeping you out of Sight. But I hope that the other party concerned has had sense enough to see and acknowledge the truth. The Company has received some blows within this Twelve month & is still upon the Anvil to be hammered into nobody knows what. But I hope and believe, that no ha[rm] will happen. I shall be sorry if any thing be done [to] hinder The Companys Servants from acquiring fortunes in an Innocent way Abroad for after all that has been said this I believe to be the likelyest way of bringing wealth from India to Europe. The State I hope will leave the Company in all matters to Govern itself, & it will be wise in any Minister to leave them accountable for what happens there but it will be allowable likewise to squeeze them to the last farthing they can pay in consistence with that Interest they ought to have as trade to manage their aff[airs]  no opportunitys of writing to me, tho I do not deserve letters yet I enjoy them Sensibly & am anxious about the wellfare of my Friends tho I think my own shoud be taken for granted when they dont hear from. Mr s Ferguson joins me in most affectionate Respects & I in name of my little Children earnestly pray for your wellfare.

And Am your most Affectionate & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
