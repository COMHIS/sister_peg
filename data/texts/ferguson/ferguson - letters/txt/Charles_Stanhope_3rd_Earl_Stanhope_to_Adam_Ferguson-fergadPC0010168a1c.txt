March 30th 1778Harley Street Cavendish Square

Sir,

Having, from the Contents of Mr Chalmer's Letter, which you enclosed in your last to my Father, asked the Opinion of very able Council upon the Subject of your Annuity, my Father desires me to inform you of the result of the Consultation; which is, that the first Step at all proper to be taken, is that Dr Ferguson shoud send a letter (through his Agent in London) to Lord Chesterfield, desiring him to fulfil by deed the Engagement, that he verbally entered into at Edinburgh last Summer, of securing to him a Annuity of Â£200, during his (Ld Chesterfields) Life, and that Dr Ferguson's Agent shoud carry to him, at the same time, a proper Bond, for him to sign to that purpose, or a Deed by which Ld Chesterfield should engage to  settle a part of his Real Estate for the securing to Dr Ferguson the said Annuity during the Life of Ld Chesterfield. It is clearly, also the opinion of this Council, that my Father should not take any Steps in this Affair.

I am Sir with great Regard 
your most Obedient humble Servant
