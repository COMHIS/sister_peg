Sir,

The Letter which accompanies this will inform Sir Henry Clinton, that I can not grant the Passport requested by his Favor of this date, without the previous instructions of Congress upon the Subject. This I have thought proper to advise you to prevent you the inconvenience of proceeding, should this find you on the way.

I have the Honor to be Sir Your most Obedient Servant

G. Washington

Head Quarter June 9: 1778
