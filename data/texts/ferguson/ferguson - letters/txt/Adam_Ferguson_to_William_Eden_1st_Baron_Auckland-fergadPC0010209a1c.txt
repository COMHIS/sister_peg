Dear Sir

As the Secretary of State has taken upon himself the conduct & execution of the Proclamations respecting Georgia & South Carolina; I have been considering whether it will not be best to send the Duplicates likewise to the American Office, there to be employed, as the Secretary of State will think fit, for the purpose that Duplicates commonly Serve to Secure against accidents  the End for which the Originals were prepared. When it occurred that these Proclamations might be sent by me to Sir Henry Clinton it was expected that the Originals were to return from the Secretary of States Office & go with your Instructions to Sir James Wright. But as the matter now is I imagine these papers should go to Sir Henry Clinton from the Secretary of States Office. He may be at a loss what to do with them if they come from me without any Notice from thence. I am sorry to give you so much trouble. I shall send Coll. O'Fannings Papers & the proposed Answer to Ld. Carlisle this Morning.

Yours most Respectfully

Adam Ferguson
