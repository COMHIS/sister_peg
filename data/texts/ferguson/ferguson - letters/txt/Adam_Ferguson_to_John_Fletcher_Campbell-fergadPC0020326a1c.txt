[1786] Argyle Square Thursday Morning

Dear Sir

This is to remind you of your promise to dine here at three O Clock. But more especially to let you know that Dr Hutton with all his impatience is to be of the Party. I told him of the Moor-fowls to tempt him. And so, he said, I shall have five minutes swallowing to make up for an hour or two waiting. Range matters if possible so as to dissappoint him of his waiting.

I am yours &c 
Adam Ferguson
