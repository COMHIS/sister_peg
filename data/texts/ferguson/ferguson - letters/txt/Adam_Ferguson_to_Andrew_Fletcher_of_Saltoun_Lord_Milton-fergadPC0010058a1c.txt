My Lord

I have enclosed the letters your Lordship gave me and a Short proposal which may serve as a Supplement to Dr Wisharts report. I have been much hurried but hope these papers do not come too late. I am with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obliged & most 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
