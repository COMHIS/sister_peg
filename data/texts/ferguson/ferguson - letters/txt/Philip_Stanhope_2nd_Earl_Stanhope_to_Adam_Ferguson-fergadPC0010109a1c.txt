Paris April the 6th 1774

Sir

As I understand that it is not at present in any persons power to make a legal settlement in your favour of an Annuity of two hundred Pounds Sterling a year for life to commence from the time of the Earl of Chesterfields attaining his Age of twenty one years, in consideration of the benefit which His Lordships Guardians have reason to expect will accrue to him from your being appointed his Governor, I do hereby engage myself & my Heirs to make such a settlement and to charge with the Payment thereof a sufficient part of the real Estates devolved to me by the death of Philip Dormer Earl of Chesterfield who died on the twenty fourth day of March in the year one thousand seven hundred & seventy three, in case neither the present Earl of Chesterfield nor any of those who stand before me in the  entail of The Estates which belonged to the said late Earl of Chesterfield, shall think fit to secure to you the aforesaid Annuity of two hundred pounds Sterling a year for the term of your Natural Life after the Earl of Chesterfields coming of Age.

I am with great truth and Regard 
Sir 
your most faithful 
Humble Servant 
Signed 
Stanhope
