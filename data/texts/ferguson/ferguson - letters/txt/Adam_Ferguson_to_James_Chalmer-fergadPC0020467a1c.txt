Hallyards near Peebles 12th July 1800

Dear Sir

I am now to write in the mournful Predicament of Heir to one of my own Children.

The young man who two or three years ago executed a bond to me in your hands is now no more. The Climat of India has been fatal to his Constitution. A Friend & Relation is remitting his Effects. A Companies Bill no 37 for £562. 10 p. has been received on my Account by Coll. Joseph Burnett & not been payable, as I am told, till October has been placed in the hands of Mrs Couts. Coll. Burnet is now at Edinburgh. I have not seen him, & do not know whether he has endorsed the Bill for payment when due but he has furnished me with the inclosed copie and Acknowledgement of my Property in the Contents. You will please present it to Mr. Couts & inquire whether any thing more will be necessary to warrant the Contents of the Bill when payed being placed to my credit in the Books of that House.  There is another Bill for £537. 10  on the way or rather come by Coll. Mc Kenzie of the same Regiment already arrived at London, & daily expected at Edinburgh. When this Bill comes to hand, I shall probably place with Messrs Mansfield & Co and believe that when both are paid I shall find it expedient to place the amount of some Other of my little Effects have gone through the Hands of Mr Couts & Mr Ramsay into some of the publick Funds.

The Accounts of the Regiment will probably have been made up & sent home also by Coll McKenzie & I must desire that you will inquire at the Agents N. Donaldson Esqr White Hall, for the State of my Late Son Captn Josephs Ferguson of the 78 Regiment Account; Obtain an Abstract of it, & let me know how it stands & in case of any ballance Instruckt me in the needful to have it Settled. I am Dr Sir

your most Obedient 
and most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
