Since My last Mr Goldie Principal of the College of Edinburgh is dead. I have already given you my opinion about the choice of a Successor.

The Clergy I am told lay Claim to any Preferments of this kind which fall in our University, as being the only rewards which their order has to expect & the only Objects which are left to excite their Emulation in Literature or any Other kind of Merit by which they may distinguish themselves. This claim of theirs however does not exclude Mr Ferguson who thoat present a Professor in the College is likewise an ordained Minister. But without excluding their Pretensions any prejudice to their Pretensions I think it unjust to exclude Professors in Universitys from the hope of the same preferments which may likewise excite their Emulation to distinguish themselves. Literary merit shoud meet with its reward in them as well as in the Clergy. Clergymen are frequently called to fill every kind of Vacancy in our Universitys and are made Professors in the different branch[e]s of Education Science. And I do not think that the little which I am told some of them pretend to have to be the exclusive Claim of being promoted to the head of Colleges shoud be acknowledged.

The practice hitherto has not been Regular in their favours. For at St Andrews and Aberdeen there were likely three heads of Colleges who were Laymen. One Mr Young a Layman was head of one of the Colleges at St Andrews before the two Colleges were United. At Aberdeen Mr Blackwall who is lately dead was Principal of the one College and Mr Chambers is now Principal of the other and both Laymen. were likewise exceptions to the Pretended Rules And I do not apprehend that any difficulty coud arise from this quarter in the present case. Mr Ferguson however whom I mentioned in my Last is not affected by this question because he is a Clergyman in fact tho at present a Professor in our University.
