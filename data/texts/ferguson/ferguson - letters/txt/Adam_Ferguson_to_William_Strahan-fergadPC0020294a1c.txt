Dear Sir

Before I had the very great Satisfaction of your last of the 18th past, I looked impatiently for the time at which I should repeat my thanks for the continuance of your kind attention to my publication. I am very sensible that if this work should meet with a favourable reception, much will be owing to that attention & to the indulgence with which you favoured me in my manner of treating the proofs. I inclose all that occurs to me for the Title page. You will please to consider whether the reference to my former publication will help to make  me known or any way contribute to set off this. I am

 
Dear Sir 
with the most sincere Respect 
& Esteem 
your most Obliged 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
