Argyle Square 13th May 
1786



Dear Carlyle

I am glad to hear of your safe return as also of your purchase and am abundantly eager to see my new property but sensible that I must have patience till there is a proper guide not only to conduct her to this place but to lead her on to the place of her destination as I have no convenience to keep her here above an hour or two & even that under the nose of Dr Blair who objected to the smell even of a Horse. If your Broker can broke me also a travelling governor for her upon reasonable terms as far as Bankhead be so good as settle the matter with him & send her on to Argyle Square to receive Instructions for the remai[n]der of her travels. I am sorry that her Pregnancy is not yet declared: as for the Opportunity you mention of making that matter sure, I am sensible there will be many able  performers: but what party do you recommend? I wish you may not mean to desert your own for in Such matters moderation does not become an Ass.

I expect two Forreigners and much broken English at dinner today so can even pun upon your Bonne Grace but imagine must be it is lined with something as you talk of its being too warm for Summer. My Wife joins in Complts to yours & is glad to find that her letter is still so near the first place Among her Comforts altho your Modesty is so great with respect to the first.

It is well for you that you got home on thursday night, if you had been with us at a certain Farm yesterday & drove home in the Evening in a certain Carriage with a certain wind & Rain in your Face your Comfort would have been cold with a witness & even that Witness not very warm. Once more for Dapple. If your Broker cannot provide me as above be so good as  let her pick about your Hedges till I can fix a time for her removeal, &c which I will do as soon as possible. I am with best respects from this house to yours Dr C your most

affectionate humble 
Servant
