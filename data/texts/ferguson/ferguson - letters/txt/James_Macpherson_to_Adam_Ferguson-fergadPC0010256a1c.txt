London Tuesday evening Sept 5th 1780

My dear friends,

I have received all your letters. Every thing you wish will be done here; but, perhaps, only when it is too late. You shall have the letters, the promises, and the performances, wanted. But considering our excessive hurry ——— our forgetfulness & and our ——— I do not know what ——— you must not expect ——— nor be disappointed. I shall do every thing, in my power. For God's sake don't desert your ground ——— Let prudence for once give way to Spirit. I have lines in my head — but will not bind myself, for futurity . . . . Many, very many other affairs of the same kind demand attention; and, if that attention depended entirely upon your humble servant, things would have, long since, been brought to bear. I flatter my self you will have a gov. t express tomorrow. We are sensible we have been deceived by Sc———Cs. But all men are liable to deception . . . .

I shall write to-morrow. Keep up your Spirits ——— I could say to each of you tu ne ced[e] malis .

J. M.

I received all your letters down to the 1st. I have not had a line from J. H. these two months. Had he been here, I could have placed him ——— I know where ——— perhaps, he would not like it.

J. M.

John is at Crecklade
