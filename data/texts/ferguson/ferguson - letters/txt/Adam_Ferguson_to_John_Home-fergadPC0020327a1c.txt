[1786]

Dear John

I am put in mind by Creech of the meeting at Fortune's to-day, but dare not venture there. I have been colded for some days & am thrown into a Sweat by my Lecture which disqualifies me for any place but my  own fire or a little walk before I shift. This I am going to take & beg if General Campbell be in town you will explain my Absence to him.

I am yours &c
