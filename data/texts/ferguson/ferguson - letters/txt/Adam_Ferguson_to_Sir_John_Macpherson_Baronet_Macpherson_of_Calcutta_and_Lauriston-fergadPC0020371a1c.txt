My Dear Friend

The expedition to Alva is much to my mind but I would fain Spare your Carriage coming so far to fetch me when you may possibly have occasion to use it in Edr. We have a Fly goes of to Edinburgh on Tuesday by which if the tickets are not all out I may be with you at 2 OClock on Tuesday: as tomorrow is Sunday I do not know whether you will receive this letter before Monday morning & I certainly cannot have your Answer before Tuesday afternoon by that time the Tuesdays Fly will be at Edinburgh & the first appointment I can make to go by that conveyance will be friday following. If I knew your precise time of wishing to Set out for Alv[a] I may possibly be able to get a chaise at Peebles in the mean I am never from home & can be ready to depart at half an hours warning by day or by Night. I am My Dear Friend your most affectionately

Adam Ferguson
