My Lord

Having received a Call to attend a young Nobleman abroad & in circumstances that require my Speedy compliance, I take this way of making my request to your Lordship & the Town Council that I may be allowed to Substitute proper persons in what remains of my bussiness in the College for this winter. Ever since I have had the honour of being a Professor I have endeavoured faithfully to discharge my duty to the Public, & if I may judge from the countenance occasionally given to me by the Patrons of the University, not without their approbation. This encourages me to hope that in a matter which is of so much importance to my family I may have  every reasonable Indulgence. And I now beg that your Lordship woud communicate my earnest Intreaty to the Council that they woud either be pleased to point out to me Persons Proper for this Substitution, Or allow me to Apply to Dr Lind to teach what remains to be taught this Session of the Natural Philosophy And to the Rev. d Mr Grieve at Dalkeith to teach what remains to be taught of the Moral Philosophy. My knowledge of the Learning & Abilitys of these Gentlemen is such; that if they undertake the several tasks I have mentioned for them; I am confident that they will perform them to the advantage of the Students & the Satisfaction of the Public. I have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord your Lordships 
most Obliged & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
