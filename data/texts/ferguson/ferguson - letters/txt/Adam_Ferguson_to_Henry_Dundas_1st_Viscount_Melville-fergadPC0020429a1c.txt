Hallyards near Peebles 9th March 1798

My Dear Sir

I have notice of your kindness in the nomination of my relation Robert Stuart to an Indian Cadetship. As I believe you would not suppose me insensible I hesitated whether to give you the trouble of opening a letter on the Subject: But as this is done: I have no more but to Pray that God may bless and Prosper you for the preservation of us all. I am with great Respect your most Obliged

and most Obedient humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
