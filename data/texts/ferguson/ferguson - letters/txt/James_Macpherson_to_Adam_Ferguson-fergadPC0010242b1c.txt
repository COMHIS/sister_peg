London Saturday July 14th 1780

My dear Sir

This goes to you, by express, carrying such letters as could be immediately written. The leave for C.C. was sent off, this day sevenight; and you may expect him soon in Scotland. In the mean time, you are to observe what follows.

C — l M — y came to our friend, my neighbour, asking the Countenance and aid of Government, for his Brother Capt. M — , who had some intention to start for the same place. But my neighbour told him, that Government were already engaged to C — l C. . .. This circumstance will render it absolutely necessary for Col. C's friends to declare him immediately. My neighbour recommends it to you, to put your foot instantly into a post-chaise; and to wait upon the Duke of Athol; to tell him your friend's intentions and solicit his Grace's interest. This will preclude any after reflection, that you started without his Grace's knowledge or concurrence. Having waited upon the Duke, go there and deliver the letters; and take every other vigorous and immediate step your better judgement and local knowledge will suggest. We, on our part, will do every thing, when you shall point out where we can be useful.

yours in great Haste 
J. M.
