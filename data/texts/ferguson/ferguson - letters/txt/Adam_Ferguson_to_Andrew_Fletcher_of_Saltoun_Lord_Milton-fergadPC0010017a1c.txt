Groninguen Octr 13th 1756

My Lord

Mr Fletcher has appeared so much better for some days past, that I am preparing to set out on my return, I am still not without uneasiness on his account but inclined to believe that this Situation is as favourable for him as any that coud be found. His Landlord has promised me a particular Attention to all his Affairs, & to call for the accounts regularly every week of such people as furnish him any thing here. He has hitherto since we set out given no signs of dissorder, & has been cautious with respect to drinking although I did not appear to restrain him in that Particular. The degree of Melancholy which possessed him perplexed me very much as I am hurried to leave this place both by the winter season coming on & my apprehensions of an Ague which used to trouble me in this Country.

As his Spirits seem to have taken a turn to the Better  I hope it may Please God to restore him fully to his former applications & Temper of Mind, he seems to be out of the way here of what formerly [xxx] might have missled & disstracted his mind. I thought it necessary however to take what precautions I could in case of the Worst. Mr Falconer whom I formerly mentioned to your Lordship, & to whom he is recommended by Mr Crawfurd, promised me to take particular care of him, & as I have informed him in confidence of the former state of his health he will be able to suit his care to that circumstance. I likewise explained his case to Dr Vandoeveren Professor of Anatomy, in whom I have much confidence as a Physician and as an Obliging Worthy Man, both agreed in thinking that his Present Landlord is a very proper person for him to lodge with, his name is Le Moine, & as I gave him your Lordships Adress, he will not fail to write if any thing remarkable occurs. If your Lordship has any commands for him Please direct (A Monsr Monsr Le Moine Maitre de Langues a Groninguen by Holland).

Mr Fletcher has given me a Copy of your Lordships last letter to him, and at his earnest desire I have  left the Latin Newtestament with him. I have computed his Stated expence for one half year.

Which in British money amounts to twenty four Pounds seven Shillings and eight pence. There are other Particulars besides Cloaths which I coud not compute such as Candles Tea Sugar &c. We have lately had a Storm in this Countrey which has cast many Wrecks on the Coast & greatly the Damaged the Shipping which plys in this Country. I intended to take the favourable weather which now offers to get over the Lakes and Marshes of Friesland.
