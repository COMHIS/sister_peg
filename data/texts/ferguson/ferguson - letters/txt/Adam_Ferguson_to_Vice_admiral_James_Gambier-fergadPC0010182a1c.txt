“Instead of transmitting the above circular letter [see Adam Ferguson to Sir William Erskine, baronet of Torrie, Fife, 8 September 1778 (Letter 121)] to the Agent for Army Victuallers and Store Ships and for Transport, it was judged proper to write the following to Rear Admiral Gambier Commanding the Navy and other Shipping in His Majesty's Service in the Port of New York and to Major Gen. l Pattison.”



 

New York Septr 11th 1778

Sir

His Majesty's Commissioners finding it Expedient to ascertain the Quantity of Ship Tonnage at present within the North and East River and the Sound, I am by their directions to request the favour that you will be so good to order the Agent for Army Victuallers and Store Ships, and the Agent for Transports to prepare and Transmit to me as soon as convenient an Account of such part of the Said Tonnage as is engaged in His Majesty's Service within their respective Departments, that I may lay the same before the Commissioners for their Excellencies Information.

I have the honour to be &c &c 
A. F.



 

 
“The above Letter sent to Admiral Gambier was thus altered when sent to M. G. Pattison, instead of ‘the Agent for Army Victuallers and Store Ships and the Agent for Transports’ as follows ‘the Commissary of Artillery’ and instead of ‘within their respective departments’ as follows ‘his Department’”.
