Edinburgh, September 18th, 1766

My Dear Miss Katy,

I am just now returned from Glasgow, where I have seen your uncle the doctor, and hope that what he writes to you will favour my request. I had written to your father before I set out from hence, and am very anxious to know his mind. Is it not possible to reckon me too among the number who have a great affection for you and a great concern for your happiness? I would fain hope that I shall be able some time or other to make my title to a place in that list very clear. Meantime, I can only have the pleasure of writing to you and assuring you of a tenderness which I had rather that my actions than my words should express. I have barely time to overtake the post, and conclude with the most earnest request that, whatever these gentlemen may think, you will pay some regard to the sincere affection with which I am, your most humble servant,

Adam Ferguson
