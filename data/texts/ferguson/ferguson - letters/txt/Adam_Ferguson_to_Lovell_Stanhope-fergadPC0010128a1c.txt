London 16 June 1775

Sr

My Lord Chesterfield has been pleased to show me a Note from you to His Lordship desiring to know whether I wished to have any thing in writing from The Duke of Chandos & yourself; as it is determined that I am not to go abroad with Lord Chesterfield & that the Commencement of my Successors Sallary is fast approaching. In order to discharge me from my Attendance on Lord Chesterfield; I am advised that directions in writing from both his Present and late Guardians will be necessary. You will Judge of the terms Proper for such a writing, & whether I shoud ask the late Guardians to put their names to the same Paper, or apply to them separately for their concurrence. As I conclude from your Letter to Lord Chesterfield that the £400 a year appointed for me during my Attendance on his Lordship is to cease on the 24th Instant, It is proper to inform you that I have received no payments by Advance And that £100 will be due to me at Midsummer for the Quarter that has passed from Lady Day. It is likewise material for me to know; to whom & at what terms I am to apply for the Payment of the £200 a year Settled upon me during my Life. Uncertainty on this point may Subject me to inconvenience As I have allotted to a Substitute all the Profits of my office at Edinburgh untill the Commencement of next winter Term, & shall not be entitled to receive any Sallary from that office before Whitsunday next year.

I have Also to inform you, that when on my Way  to Geneva last year I understood from Sr George Savile that the expences of that Journey were to be allowed me. I was detained about ten days at London waiting for instructions from My Lord Chesterfields Guardians and about as long at Paris waiting for a Pass by which means the whole expence amounted to £85. I have the honour to be &c
