Dear Sir,

My transcriber being out of the ways I have been Obliged to run over the inclosed myself but hope it will be legible & serve the Purpose.

As I have not time for long negotiation I hope your Correspondent will be at a word with me & I shall wait his Answer.

I am Dr Sir

your most Obedient humble Servant

P.S. I should wish to have the work printed here that I might attend to it: for we should not have the command of the Post from London, now as formerly. If we do not agree I shall wish to have the inclosed returned to me here.

Mr Creech
