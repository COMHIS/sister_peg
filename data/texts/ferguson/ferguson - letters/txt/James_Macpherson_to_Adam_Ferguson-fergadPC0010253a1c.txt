My Dear Sir

Since I wrote you this morning, by Express, I received a very discouraging letter from our friend, the C â€” 1. But I know his character so well, that he will fall in the last Ditch. Time pressed Unexpectedly; and I much regret, that decisive powers, relative to a situation here, have not been sent. An Express may come too late; yet it may be ventured. Cannot three little fellows, beat these two overgrown rascals, that have been so saucy. I am much hurried; and the last bell, is in the street.

yours &c
