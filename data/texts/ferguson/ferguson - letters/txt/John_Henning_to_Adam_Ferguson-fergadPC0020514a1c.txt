â€˜Edinburgh Decr 22d 1810; 48 Mid Rose St

Dr. A. Fergusson. Dear Sir

Having been from home for eight days I take the first moments after my return to answer a Card which I find laid on my Table signifying your desire to know whether I would undertake to make a full sized Bust of the Right Honble Lord Melville. I am requested by the Card in the Card to write to you.

I assure you my Dear Sir that I do feel much flattered from this mark of attention from a Philosopher with whose mind I have had considerable intimacy for the last twenty years of my Life.

I would certainly have found it gratifying if I had anticipated that any day I should personally know Dr Fergusson and that he should do me the honour to make the request qhich he has done with best respects to the Ladies. I have the honour to be with the greatest respect and esteem your obliged and

humble svt

John Henning
