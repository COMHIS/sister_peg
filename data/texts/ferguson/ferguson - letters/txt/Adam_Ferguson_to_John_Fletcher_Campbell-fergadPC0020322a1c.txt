Bankhead 17 June 1786

My Dear Sir

I received your Letter here a few nights ago & sent the inclosed to be put in the Post Office at Edinburgh next morning. I am much Obliged to you for the Attention &c you have bestowed on my Affair, and Am Satisfied with the account you give. The Principle upon which I proceed is implicit faith. If the undertakers are at ease I am satisfied: & with the immediate Prospect which you give of our seeing you shall for the present Say no more.

I am glad you remember the suggestion of some years back & should be still better pleased to think you in Earnest. Panurge is a Sage Counsel & his Scruples lead to the Point: So proceed. We have Still some  Sunshine here: but such a North east wind for Some days as requires more Cloathing than ever I carried in the coldest day in Winter & it puts me more in Mind of the See Blink which we read in the history of Green Land than of the Pine Apples you mention. We have better thing Viz. Eggs Butter Cakes & Cabbages & I have forgot every Complaint: but what the Soil & the Climat & the prospect of bad Crops of hay and Corn Occasion. It may be matter of curiosity to you to know that I have sold my house in Argyle Square for the house which I carried you to see at the Siennes, Property for Property without any odds or Ballance. And tho the Conveyances are not exchanged the Bargain is concluded as far as exchange of Missives can Accomplish it. My Object is  to have a farm yard at Edinburgh to communicate with this place. And exchange Dung for Hay & Corn &c &c &c. But since I am on the Subject of Property please know that I have three Mares & two of them taken [to] the Horse So that by this time next year I may have five Mares besides a She Ass that carrys her Load to town two or three times a week. But this is doing more tha[n] you desired. I was only to tell you that you[r] Letter came Safe which I hope the [xxx xxx] will also be in due time. I am Dear Sir

your most Affectionate 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
