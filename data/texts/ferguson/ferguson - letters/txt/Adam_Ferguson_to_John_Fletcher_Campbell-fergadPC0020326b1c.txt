My Dear Sir

I will do my utmost to be with you on Thursday, & have not at present reason to doubt my Ability. It was mortifying that I could not be with you to day: but I must Sacrifice every thing to college Bussiness for which every slight cold almost dissables me altho I should feel no Other Symptom.

yours most Affectionately

A: Ferguson
