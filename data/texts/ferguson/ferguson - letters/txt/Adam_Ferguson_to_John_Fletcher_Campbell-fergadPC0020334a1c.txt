My Dear Sir

We came home last night & I would have been to call for you this morning if I had not begun my motions with a Travel to the west end of the new Town which disabled me both in point of time & strength to decline so far from my straight course home in the opposite direction. I write this least I should come too late in the morning to let you know I hope Bob Adam will dine here tomorrow on your Hare & Goose & will like them the better that you are here to Answer for their goodness so I beg no trivial accident may deprive us of the pleasure. I am

My Dear Sir 
your most Affectionate humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
