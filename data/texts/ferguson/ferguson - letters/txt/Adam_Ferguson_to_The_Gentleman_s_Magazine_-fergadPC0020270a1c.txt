In a pamphlet, intituled An Enquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems ascribed to Ossian, having read the following passage, p. 45, — “Mr Smith mentions Dr Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry, in which he says, the Doctor confesseth, that he himself heard pieces of it recited; and being compared with the translation, exactly corresponded. Dr Percy does not understand a syllable of the Earse, and therefore could be no judge. The truth is, Dr Blair and Professor Ferguson, when Dr Percy was at Edinburgh, took care to introduce a young student from the Highlands, who repeated some verses, of which Professor Ferguson said such and such sentences in Fingal were the translation.” To prevent any inferences which might be drawn from my silence, I think it material to declare that the above passage, so far as it relates to me, is altogether false; and that I never was present at the repetition of verses to Dr Percy by a young student from the Highlands.
