Edinburgh 1st June 1795

My Dear Friend

I have just now the pleasure or your letter & feel greatly Obliged for your immediate movement in my Affairs & to the Duke of Queensberry on your Acc't. His Graces leave to live at Nydpath was the utmost I could wish.

The Castle has not been inhabited but has been kept tight appeared perfectly dry & so far as I Observed not in want of much expensive repairs: but before I take any resolution must have a tradesman to advise me. The taxes will amount to something & what Ground I have must pay rent: but with all this it may be the most Oeconomical Situation for me & this is my Object.

I have nothing to do in this Town & wish to avoid the expence of living in it. So that my continuing to breath may be of some use to my family which it now is not: but of this move when you favour me with your Arguments per Contra. I shall endeavour to have something agreed  upon with the Duke of Queensberrys Man of Bussiness here to be Submitted to his Grace as soon as possible. The He has already told me that The Duke cannot give a Lease beyond his own Life. But with this I should be Satisfied or even his Saying that he will not remove me &c.

The Timber I understand is to be Sold & the Place therefore not likely to Tempt a Succeedeng Lord so that I should have little apprehension of being removed during my Life. As for the Company in Seaforths Regiment I have had letters from Joseph about it. The Price he states of Â£950 which I have agreed and am ready to Lodge whenever called upon to do so. I do not know whether this price be considered as the difference between the Lieutenancy & Captaincy or how it is; but I am determined to make no Stop in the Matter. I pray you to ply the Duke of Queensberry for instructions to his Agent here to Settle with me as we best can: To say the truth I do not much regret the Prussian Peace &c &c yours most Affectionately

Adam Ferguson
