Hallyards April 25, 1809

My Dear Sir

I should have acknowledged your Favour along with the Russian Performance sooner but when I was about to do so a Letter to the same Effect from Dr Brewster telling me how the parcel came to him & that he had troubled with [xxx] of the Copies for me seemed as he was a Stranger to call for my first Acknowledgement so that he had the first Post & as I do not see to write more than once a day you have been deferred to the Second.

On p. 2 the handwriting is continued vertically, and it is as tremulous as in the last few letters, clearly from the hand of a very old man, endowed with imperfect sight.

Never was Parent less  able to distinguish his ofspring than I am in this Instance. All the Seasoning of Hallyards canno[t] even make out my Name on the Title Page. Dr Brewster calls it my Principles but you guess Better that it is the Text Book under its last title Institutes. Dr. B[r]ewster is your Acquaintance & I wish to be more known to him to this you can help on occasion. Observe how I have mismanaged this Letter in my blindness beginning on a wrong page but I am nevertheless with much Regard your most obedient humbl[e] Servant

Adam Ferguson
