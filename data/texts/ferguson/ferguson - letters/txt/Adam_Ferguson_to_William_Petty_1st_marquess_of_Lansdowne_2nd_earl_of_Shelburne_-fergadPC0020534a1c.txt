My Lord

I have made up a Packet of newspapers for your Lordship. It contains some Specimen of the Controversy which Subsists here about the Militia. Our Cold reasonings deserve very little notice at London, but there are some strokes of a different stile in some of these Papers, & I cannot resist indulging my own Partiality to the Subject. I believe your Lordship has been told of an object which I have a view to here in the way of Preferment. I mentioned it lately to Coll' Clerk & must refer to him for Particulars. It is the place of Principal in Our College, The person who holds it now is very old & I am just now informed that he is taken Ill & considered as Dying. How far your Lordship can or ought in Propriety to interfere in it a question which I avoid thinking of. It is a very great Pleasure to me to think that I coud have recourse  to your Lordships Protection & favour upon a proper occasion, without expecting any Attention to my request where it is improper. This place however stands in my way & is the only one which from my Situation I coud expect to Reach, Which is all the Apology I can make for this Trouble And am with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most faithful & most humble 
Servant Adam Ferguson
