Dear Sir

I must beg the favour that if you can stay at Home a few Minutes you will give me time to come to you with a Question which some Merchants of London have this moment put to me Respecting the Meaning of the Word Stores in the Commissioners last Proclamation on which I intend to wait on you at Greenwich.

I am 
your most Obt 
humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
