Dear Brother

I left Sandy hook 23d Decr; and after a tempestuous passage Arived at Mildford haven 23d Janry travelled through South Wales the finest Country my Eyes ever beheld, tarried two days at Bristol with some old aquaentances, and arived here three days ago & with about 200 Pounds in my Pocket.

My Friends here advised me to wait on Lord Carlile and Mr Eden, where I was received with Politeness & kindness. Mr Eden enquired what views I had or what I intended to do. I told him that I had none but retiring to some Country Village and living as Cheap as I could on the little I had left.

He desired me to write and Consult you that I might depend on Lord Carlils Intrest and his, I mean not troubling them further till I hear from you, and wish to be entirely directed by you, I have no complaints to make but the loss of my little Property, nor have I any Private Resentment.

General Prescot is here who always treated me with Friendship after I once Approached him, Lieutenant Colonel Innes who Commanded the Artilery at Rhode Island and under whos Protection I obtained a Passage in the same Ship and at the same table with himself is also come home and I belive setts out  Imediatly to Visit his Family at Perth, should you happen to see him at Edinburgh I wish you would thank him for his Friendship to me. I am now endeavouring to Cloth myself in a Plain and decent manner under the direction of my worthy old Friend Mr Cargill at whos house in Lombart Street I now am having as yett taken no Lodgings.

I have little inclination for Steering to the Northward as yett having found traveling by land fatigueing and expensive.

Affairs in America bore to me but an indiff[e]rent aspect the Winter setting in with great Severity the ground Covered with Snow, ice floatting about in the North and East Rivers, fewell and Lodgings extreamly scarce, Many of the Troops hutted on York, Statten, and Long Iselands, an expedition going forward of about 7 or 8 thousand men, under the Commander in Chieff and Lord Cornwallace, with a large train of Artilery, their destination supposed to be first for Virginia (where 4 or 5 Sail of D; Estangs Squadron had arived in destress) and afterwards the Carolinas, much may be expected from this Expedition should it take Place and much to be feared from the inclemency of the weather and Tempestuous season of the year &c &c.

My Complements to your Family and other Friends, you may direct for me where I am or to the care of William Innes Esqr Mercht London â€” I am your Affectionat Brother
