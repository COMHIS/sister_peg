Edr 1st Octr 1787

Dear Sir

I had notice some time ago from the Messrs Drummond at Charing Cross that the following Sums were lodged with them by the Messrs Thomas Payne & Son, to my Acc't £32 in Cash.

£13/100 John Stockdales note due 23 Septr you will remember enough of the transaction relating to the Roman History to recollect that whatever came from Messrs Payne on that Acc't should be lodged with Mr Pulteneys Banker & to his Acc't untill his advance was discharged, My desire therefore is that you will take the trouble  to inquire whether Stockdales note be paid and if so, to have the £100 transferred to MR Pulteneys Credit as above. If any formal order be necessary from me to that effect be so good as let me know what it should be & on what Stamp &c. I must at the same time remind you to make at a proper time the usual application for the half years Annuity due from Lord Chesterfields Trustees at Michaelmas. I am Dear Sir

your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
