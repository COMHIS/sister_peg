London 29 May 1779

My Lord

Being to Deliver to your Lordship the Letter of His Majestys Commissioners containing their Thanks for His Majestys gracious Acceptance of their Services, I meant at the same time to have begged Leave to present my own to your Lordship for the Obliging Protection I have experienced both in My Nomination as Secretary & in the Discharge of My humble Duties. It will ever be a happiness to me to have any opportunity of exerting my Affection & Loyalty to His Majesty & of Evincing the Sense I retain of My Obligation to your Lordship.

I have the Honour to be with 
the greatest Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obedient & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson













Lord George Germain
