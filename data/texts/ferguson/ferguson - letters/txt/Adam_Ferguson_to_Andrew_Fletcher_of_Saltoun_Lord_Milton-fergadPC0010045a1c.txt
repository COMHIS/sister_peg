Edinburgh Novr 10th 1761

My Lord

I have met with Interruptions which hindered My writing the inclosed till this day at one O Clock, & made it impossible for me to go to Brunstane to Dinner. As your Lordship said you was to be in Town tomorrow forenoon I will wait upon you sometime between twelve & two wherever I find you are. If I have mistaken your Lordships meaning, I can have your farther directions then. I hope you will excuse my keeping the French Treaty tomorrow as I have not yet had time to read it.

I am 
with the greatest 
Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most faithful & 
most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
