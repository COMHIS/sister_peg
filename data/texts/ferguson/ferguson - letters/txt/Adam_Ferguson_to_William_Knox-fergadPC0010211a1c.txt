Fludyer Street 22 April 
1779



Dear Sir

The Commissioners find great Difficulties in executing the Proclamation to prolong the Effect of their former Proclamations at New York beyond the 1st of June. These Difficulties arise Partly from their not having received the Official Requisition to that Purpose from the Secretary of States Office & the opinion of The Law Officers. It is Proposed that they should meet at Lord Carlisles at  One O'Clock today & I apprehend that those Papers will be necessary to Enable them to take any resolution.

I am with great Respect 
Dear Sir 
your most Obedt 
Humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
