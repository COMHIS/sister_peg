Sir

Altho Mr Creech has had access to know our progress in printing the work about which we have been some time agreed. It may be proper for me to acquaint you that it is now finished & that you may chuse your time of publication. I shall wish to have copies sent in my name to General Clerk in Mansfield St Cavendish Square. To Mr Pulteney Bath House Piccadilly. Mr Dundas Secretary of State Mr Pitt first Lord of the Treasury. Lord Loughborough Loughborough. Mr Small late Surgeon to the Garrison of Minorca. And Sir John McPherson when he returns to England to whom you may also give on my account as many copies as he shall be pleased to call for.

I have looked over the Essay on the History  of Civil SocietyÂ : but find nothing material to offer. It is properly introductory & Stimulating to the Study of its Subject & without going farther into particulars must remain in its original form.

I am Sir your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

P.S. Mr Strahan to whom I beg my best respects will know where to send to Mr Small
