Hallyards, 2nd Sept. 1798

. . . I cannot enough express my obligation to you on his account, and your readiness in assisting him in getting forward in his line of preferment. It gave me some pain to hear of his anxiety to secure his debt to me by ensuring his life. The proposal when first mentioned to me I rejected, and signified so much to his correspondent at London; but it seems too late to prevent the Ensurance for one year being payed. I have since authorized my son Adam to forbid it altogether, and hope it will not be repeated. If there is to be an insurer, let me be the person. If there were to be a loss, that of the money would be the least. And I mention the subject to you, trusting you will be so good as to relieve his mind of all anxiety on this account. . . . I am commissioned by more than one person in this family to thank you for your letters, for if Joseph have reason to complain of our silence, we have you and Mr. A. Johnston of Calcutta to thank for the only account we have had of him for above 18 months. I am, my dear sir, your most affectionately

Adam Ferguson
