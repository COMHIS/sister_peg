Blackheath June 3d 1775

My Dear Sr

As my Situation is likely to become very delicate upon the Resignation which I am made to expect, I wish very much to have your opinion whether I shoud not before this change is declared apply to those by whom I am placed here for their Instructions how I shoud act upon this occasion. Or whether I shoud wait in Silence for their declaration & then observe to those with whom remain connected, that as the Authority by which I hold my place has ceased to exist a new appointment may be necessary to my continuing in it. And whether if they decline making any such appointment or otherwise declare their Intention to part with me & talk of the terms on  which I am to withdraw, I may not take the Liberty to mention you as a Person to whose opinion in concert with any one they may be pleased to appoint, I am willing to Submit all my Claims. Smith woud occur to some of them Perhaps as the proper person to treat on this occasion but one Philosopher is enough in any one bussiness, And as I have nobody else besides yourself I most earnestly beg that You will not decline it. The part you have always taken in my Affairs woud make any apology in this particular case or for this letter impertinent. When you take the trouble to write be so good as keep in General terms without nameing Persons or things least a letter shoud fall by or get into improper hands here. I am My Dear Sr with the greatest Respect your most Affectionate

and most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

Be so good as direct for me at Mr Maynes Banker Banker in Jermyn Street London
