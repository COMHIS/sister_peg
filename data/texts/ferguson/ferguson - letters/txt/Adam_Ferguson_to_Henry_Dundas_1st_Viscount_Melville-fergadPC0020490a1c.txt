Hallyards near Peebles 9th June 1804

My Dear Lord

I am aware of the Impropriety of intruding on your Lordship in these times: but my Tenure in the course of Nature cannot be long, And Anxious concern for a Son of mine, who has been now for years an unemployed Writer to The Signet at Edinburgh, has become irresistible. I flatter myself that he is not to blame; And I could account for his want of Success, from the train into which the Bussiness of that Profession has got, of which I was not apprised untill it was too late. But a long letter would not be excuseable.

I have not at present any particular  Request to make; if I had I should probably only interfere with some previous Arrangement. My wish is merely to place the Circumstance of my Son in your Lordship[s] View; And leave it to the Operation of that kind intention towards My Family of which I have So Sensibly felt the effects. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord your Lordships most Obliged and 
most Obedt humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
