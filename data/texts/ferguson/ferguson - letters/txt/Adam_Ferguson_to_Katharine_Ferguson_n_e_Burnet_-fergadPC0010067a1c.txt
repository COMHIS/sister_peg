Edinburgh Sept. 24, 1766

My Dear Katie,

You have a paper enclosed which I should have sent to your father, if it were not for the inclination I have to correspond with you. Please deliver it to him: he will easily understand what forms remain on your part and his, and if there is anything amiss, it can be set to rights when we meet. It is such as a man of business here has scrolled for me. I have a line from your uncle the Doctor this morning. He is to dine here on Sunday next, and we set out on Monday morning for Aberdeen. I told you what was proposed in my last. We may be at Aberdeen on Wednesday evening, but I at present think it will be pleasanter on the road than there, unless I am permitted to see you, and we shall probably ly at Stonehive and go in to Aberdeen on Thursday the second of October, in the morning, to meet that afternoon, and I hope not to part again in a hurry. You will not be surprised at my proposing to leave Aberdeen again sometime on Friday the third of October; I have much to do here. But there or here, or wherever you are will be Paradise and every inn on the road a palace. Pray write to me, that I may know you have received my last and this, that there is no mistake, and that I may have the pleasure of receiving what comes from you. I am, my dear Kate,

most passionately yours

Adam Ferguson
