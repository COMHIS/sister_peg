Edinburgh 12th June 1780

My Lord

I have a few Posts ago received the Copy of an Indenture or Grant executed by the Earl of Chesterfield in my Favours of an Annuity of Â£200 during our joint Lives.

As I have in this matter, from the beginning of any Dispute concerning it, considered myself as a Trustee for my Family & not at liberty to obey any Impulse of sentiment that might arise in my mind I followed entirely the Judgement of Persons whose Authority might be Sufficient to Justify me, And am happy to find the matter come into such a State, as to require my  Releasing your Lordship fully of any Engagements to me, as Guardian to the Earl of Chesterfield.

Your Lordships Letter dated to me at Paris on the 6th of April 1774 has been some time in The Hands of my Agent at London who has Direction to return it in the same Cover with this.

I shall be happy to enjoy the Continuance of your Lordships favourable opinion & have the Honour to be with the most affectionate wishes for the wellfare of your Family.

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obliged & most 
Obedient Humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
