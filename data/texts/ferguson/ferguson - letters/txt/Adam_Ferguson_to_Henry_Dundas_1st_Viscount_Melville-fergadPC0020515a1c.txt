St Andrews 7 October 1810

My Dear Lord

The Within is a List of Publications now in my possession. Dr Hill had left this place on his Way to Duneira but I trust this may come to hand before he comes away. I am particularly fond of Troop Ships or floating Barracks While the Continent is as one Party against us & we are surrounded by the sea our Army should be afloat.

I am glad to think I may live to see or Grant the Bust if not the Statue and have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect

your Lordships most Obliged 
& most Obedient Humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
