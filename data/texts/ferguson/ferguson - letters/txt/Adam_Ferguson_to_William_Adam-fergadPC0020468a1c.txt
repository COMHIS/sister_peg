Hallyards near Peebles 20th May 1801

Mr Adam has helped Mr Walter Laidlaw, but Ferguson hasn't answered the letter which William Adam has sent him, to inform him of the successful conclusion of his efforts. Ferguson assures his correspondent that this ‘did not proceed from Indifference to you’, since his friend W. Clerk informs him that his Silence ‘appears to be odd’. He adds that his habits with his correspondent and everyone relating to his family, in the past ‘were likely to have an effect very different from that of neglect’.

Mr Laidlaw has been sent to Portsmouth, and soon after to the coasts of Africa.
