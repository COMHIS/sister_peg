Hallyards 4th Octr 1803

Dear Sir

you have as formerly on the Other Leaf of this paper my Affidavit together with the Minister of Manors Certificate of my Residence in his Parish. The Last I should presume is not necessary & you will please to tell me whether it be so or no As the Minister may be from home at the Term as he has now been for some Days.

I find myself indebted to My Brother in Law Mr Samuel Burnett Â£ 32:10:11 and you will please to reserve a round Sum to Answer it when he sends his discharge to you as he will be told to do. I am Dr Sir

your most Obedt humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
