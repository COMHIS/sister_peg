. . . most sincere Attachment both to Master and Man in the Present Gov't And yet I earnestly wish that they woud hoist a Certain Sail, which without perhaps any better Steering than the present may land us somewhere. The Sail I mean woud be to America the very Signal which I think we shoud make to them of an Intention not to Invade their Libertys but of a Resolution to Support the Authority of the State by their destruction and at any hazard of our own. Nothing can be done,  for which a Minister, will not be exposed to be tore to pieces. We need bold men who will do the best they can in contempt of that Danger.

My Idea of a General Parliament for America may appear odd. What Unite them; shoud they not rather be keept Separate that we may govern by dividing. I have much to say on that Subject being much impressed with a notion that one great state is much more easily Governed than many Small ones.  As to Jo Homes Play, whether it was oweing to his own Neglect or to the Caprice of the Public let it go. We who know him must not mind such trifles as that. On looking back to this letter I find it so Abrupt & Enigmatical that I am tempted to keep it till I have time to translate it but perhaps it may Amuse you more as it is. Of all things let us not be lulled by any fancyed Appearances of peace not to double & redouble our Armament on that Very account. And so wishing you much Success with Tua & him success in all his Affairs

I am &
