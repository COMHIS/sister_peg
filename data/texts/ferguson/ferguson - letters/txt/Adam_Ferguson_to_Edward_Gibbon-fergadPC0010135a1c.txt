Edinburgh, March 19th, 1776

Dear Sir,

I received about eight days ago, after I had been reading your History, the copy which you have been So good as to send me, and for which I now trouble you with my thanks. But even if I had not been thus called upon to offer you my respects; I coud not have refrained from congratulating you on the merit, & undoubted success of this valuable performance. The Persons of this place, whose Judgement you will value most, agree in opinion, that you have made a great addition to the Classical Literature of england, and  given us, what Thucydides purposed leaving with his own Countreymen, A Possession in Perpetuity. Men of a certain Modesty and Merit always exceed the expectation of their Friends; and it is with very great pleasure I tell you: that altho you must have observed in me every mark of Consideration and regard; that this is nevertheless the case I receive your Instructions, and Study your model, with great deference, and join with every one else in applauding the extent of your Plan in hands so well able to execute it. Some of your readers I find were impatient to get at the fifteenth Chapter, and began at that place. I have not heard much of their Criticism but am told that many doubt of your Orthodoxy. I wish to be always of the Charitable side while I own you have proved that the Clearest stream may become foul when it comes to run over the muddy bottom of human Nature. I have not stayed to make any  particular remarks: If any should occur on a Second reading I shall not fail to lay in my claim to a more needed & more useful admonition from you in case I ever produce any thing that merits your Attention.

And am with the greatest respect Dear Sir Your most Obliged, and most humble Servant,

Adam Ferguson
