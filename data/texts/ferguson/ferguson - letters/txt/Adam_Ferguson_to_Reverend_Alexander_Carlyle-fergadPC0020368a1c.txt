My Dear Carlyle

The Girls tell me that Mrs Carlyle or you were so good as to say that when we should have made our Settlement you would come and see it. It should be fain to hasten that visit while we may hope for some tolerable weather, having entertainment in some sort for Man & Woman tho not for Man & horse being still without Hay or Oats or Stabling or Pasture, if it were not for an eventual engagement with Sir John Mc Pherson to accompany to Alva wherever he calls me to Edr for that purpose his time was uncertain & so must mine be till I hear from him. As soon as I know that you may expect to find me at home I will let you know & leave you to Select your days.

If Mrs Carlyle were a Chemist like you & me she would soon find that the whole Atmosphere  here about is made of Oxigene or if she were a Poet like other People she would find that our Water is Nectar & our very bear bannocks not to say Mutton is what the Gods of Old called Ambrosia: But I am sensible it is a Sin to be tempting Peoples Appetites till they are upon the point of Gratification which I hope will be soon.

The Post here is a great Comfort being punctual to his time every day between 3 & 4. So send us your news that whatever we do may be concerted.

I am Dr Carlyle 
most affectionately yours &c &c 
Adam Ferguson





P.S. I might take it for granted you know our direction but to make more sure than ever Certainly please to direct for me at Nydpath near Peebles.
