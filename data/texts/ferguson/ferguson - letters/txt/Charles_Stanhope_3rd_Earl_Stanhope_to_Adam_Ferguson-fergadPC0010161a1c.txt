Sir

I received in due time the favour of your letter of the 16th inst. and having consulted with my Agents about the contents of it, I am of opinion that it will be very proper for you to draw a Bill on Lord Chesterfield himself for the Â£200 due this Christmass on account of your claim, which he has acknowledged; the effect of which draft, it is thought would be very material in the Suit proposed to be commenced in the Court of Chancery. This Suit will still take place, if Lord Chesterfield does not secure to you the Annuity (which I promised you as his Guardian in my letter of April 6th 1774) and absolutely clear me from all expence or risk in any possible event whatsoever in relation to that engagement. Whatever acknowledgement your late Pupil may have made to you of impropriety in his behaviour, he has never made any to me, who had at least as much reason to be offended with it.

My Family desire their compliments to you: I am with great truth

Sir Your most faithful humble Servant

Stanhope

Chevening Decr 24th 1777. To Dr Ferguson
