Dear General

In my way to visit the Hudsons bay colony on Leith Walk with Dr Hutton we met them coming up to Town. The principal Curiosity among them Sails for the Orkneys on Thursday: but I prevailed upon them to dine here tomorrow & shall be happy if you can be of the Company. Your most Obedient humble Servant
