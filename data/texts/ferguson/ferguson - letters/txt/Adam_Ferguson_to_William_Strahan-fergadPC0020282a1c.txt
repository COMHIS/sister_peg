Edinburgh 18th June 1782

Dear Sir

I returne the first Proof & thank you most sincerely for the attention you have bestowed upon it. I hope you will always find me very ready to profit by your hints or corrections. When you proposed a change I have adopted it: or where you expressed a doubt have endeavoured to give some other turn to the expression.

I send it to the Post tonight but may not always have this in my Power, your Post may not arrive so early nor my labours be so light. I wrote to you on Thursday last wishing to know what your Packet of today has told me. I suspected that all your hands might be laid up with the Influenza or as one of my Correspondents calls it the news paper Fever which seems to  Spread as far any news paper can procure any Intelligence.

We had a report yesterday of a great addition made by Lord Rodney to his former Victory & Captures, come by Vessels from Jamaica into Clyde: but I have not heard what todays Post brings & need not inquire for your Information you will have it if true from Other Quarters. Wishing Success to our Work & our Correspondence

I am Dear Sr your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
