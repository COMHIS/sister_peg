My Dear Friend

Tho' the time is now approaching at which I have for some time past flattered myself with the hopes of seeing you here; I take my chance of overtaking you at Brompton with a few lines.

The Scheme of a Country Life, which you proposed to dispute, still remains with me; And I have been looking out for some place at which to Settle. Among Others I have seen the Castle of Nydpath on the Tweed, belonging to the Duke of Queensbury. It has been lately dismantled or Stript of its furniture & so far destined to become the habitation of Bats & Owls or what is little Better such a Tennant as I am. The Servant who showed the place told me that His Grace has been asked to let it: but declined, which makes my prospect somewhat desperate. I have nevertheless made proposals in Form to the Man of Bussiness here. And beg the favour that if you should see the Duke of Queensbury you will try to incline His Grace not to forbid any transaction from with me. And I undertake to satisfy you that the Scheme I propose is the best for my family as well myself. I am your most Affectionate

humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
