Dear Sir

I am very glad to find that you take up the Bussiness of procuring publick benefits in our part of the Countrey. It is now your turn & I hope that you will not drop it soon. My private interest in the Lime Road was much greater some years ago than it is now: but if you make a very good Road you may tempt me to use it a little still. At any Rate I am willing to Contribute & considering the comparative value of my Concern I am affraid I may be thought to have done so extravagantly. You will find my Subscription of three Guineas at the end of the paper you  are pleased to Address to me. I heartly wish you success in whatever you Undertake either for the Benefit of your own Estate or the Conveyance of the Publick, and Am

Dear Sir 
your most Obedt 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
