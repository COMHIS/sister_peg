Edinburgh 23d May 1783

My Dear Sir

I have sent to My Lord Carlisle the original of which the inclosed is a Copy. And must repeat to you what I have mentioned to his Lordship, that I distinctly remember the particulars for which Mr Holland referrs to my knowledge; And that the other parts of his representation are agreeable to what I was made to understand when at New York. He is pleased to desire that I would add any things farther that my  recollection of his Services may Suggest. But I am sensible that the case is Sufficiently affecting not to need my assistence if the protection Mr Holland Sollicits depend on your feelings.

I am to take the opportunity to thank you on account of my Brother, who in writing to me of the Continuance of favour to him imputes it to you & Sir Grey Cooper, And I beg that you will accept of My Acknowledgements joined to his. I have the honour to be with great Respect

My Dear Sir your most Obliged & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
