My Lord

I had notice from Mr Home by last Post that I was chosen Professor in the College of Edinburgh. Nothing coud happen more agreeable to me & it gives me great pleasure to think that I shall soon have an opportunity of thanking your Lordship in Person, to whose friendship alone I own that piece of good fortune. I shall be very happy if your Lordship continues to have satisfaction from that kind protection you have given me on this & former occasions.

I was to wait on Mr Fletcher this morning:but missed him, I shall go to receive his commands before I set out for Scotland which will be as soon as I can settle my little affairs here. The people here are not much alarmed with the French  Invasion even People who allow it practicable have no impression of its consequence. I am told that one Miss Grey who is lately returned from Holland says; The French Minister at the Hague advised her not to go to England in a time of such confusion, or if she must go, offered her letters of recommendation to The Officers of the French Army. This piece of news your Lordship may not have heard from any other hand, Altho you will certainly hear that a Battle is expected in Westphalia. Prince Ferdinand is unwilling to pass the Weser, & has given it as his opinion that Hanover woud suffer more from the two Armys before an Action than it will lose by Contributions in case his Army is defeat.

I am With The greatest respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most obliged & most humble 
Servant 
Adam Ferguson
