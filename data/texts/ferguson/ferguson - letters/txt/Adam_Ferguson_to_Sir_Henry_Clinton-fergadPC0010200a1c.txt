London Febry 4th 1779

Sir

Since the Date of the Letter which I had the Honour to write to your Excellency by order of His Majesty's Commissioners inclosing Copies of their Correspondence & proceedings that have passed since Lord Carlisle Mr Eden left New York; Application has been made to Their Excellencies setting forth that Sundry Goods Particularly Flax seed Staves, & Mahogany, ready for exportation to Great Britain have been long detained at New Port in the Province of Rhode Island And it has appeared to them expedient with the Approbation of His Majestys Principal  Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the inclosed Proclamation shoud be Issued, for the relief of Merchants & Others interested in that Place granting them a Freedom of Export to the same Extent & Under Precautions Similar to those that were Employed in the Proclamation of the 26th Septr published at New York. That is instead of the Port Officers Established at New York, empowering the Commander of His Majesty's Treaty at New Port Rhode Island to grant the Permission therein Set forth.

The Extension of this Priviledge to Rhode Island did not take place at the same time it was Granted to New York because it did not then Appear that Goods for exportation had been Collected at the first of those Places.

Your Excellency will farther please to Observe, that your Name is by Order of The Other Commissioners inserted in the Title of this Instrument & a place left for your Excellency's Signature that in case you shall approve of it & nothing appear to render improper the Publication & Effect of this Proclamation, it may have the Sanction of your Authority & being Communicated to the Commanding  Officer at Rhode Island it may be published in the News Papers of that Place & of New York or Otherwise As your Excellency many shall be pleased to order.

I have the Honour to be with the Greatest Respect Sir your Excellencys most obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

To His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton 
Commander in Chief of 
His Majestys Forces in 
North America &c &c &c
