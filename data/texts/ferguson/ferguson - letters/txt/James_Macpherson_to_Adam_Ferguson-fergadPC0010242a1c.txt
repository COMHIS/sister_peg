London July 8th 1780

I received your letter; and have seen our friend, my neighbour. Letters for leave to C.C. will be sent off, to night. The Letters to all those you mentioned, and in the manner you mentioned, will meet him, on his arrival in Scotland.

My neighbour recommends to you to gain, on any terms, the three poor ones. The rich and independent will be gained in another way. Places may be promised and they will be given to such as chuse that line. In short every thing we can do, shall be done. This I am authorized to write you. . . . He thinks five hundred to each of the poor and a douceur to the D———l ———gates.

Don't stand upon triffles. The business has been already so well explained, that one may be understood, through the above hints. As the ground is now laid, we may trust the rest to the judgement and activity of the concerned. No time should be lost; as opportunity must be taken by the forelock.

No news of any consequence.
