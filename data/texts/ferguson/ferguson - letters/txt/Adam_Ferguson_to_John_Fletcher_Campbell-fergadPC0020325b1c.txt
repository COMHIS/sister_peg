My Dear Sir

I hope you dont intend to travel today. I had enough of the Sun yesterday & mean to try what repose & shade will do today. I wish you would trust your Dinner here today at three OClock. Dr Black is commonly here & Dr Hutton often in the Afternoon.

your most Affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
