Edinburgh Jan.ry 8th 1776

Dear Sr

I am strongly Solicited by a young Gentleman who is my Relation, to make offer of his Services & to beg your favour in procuring him a Commission in case the list of Subalterns in your Regiment be not compleat. He is confident that he coud in a few Weeks raise about thirty men, of whom Several, he says have already promised to follow him in case he shoud have occasion.

I have endeavoured to perswade him that it is next to certain your list is compleat  and that you must have had many applications for every Commission: but his importunity which I respect in the present Aspect of the Service has overcome my reluctance to take this Liberty with you. He is from Athol, his name Alexr Robertson, about twenty: is of a figure & Spirit that woud suit any Company of Granadiers. But this I am sensible may not entitle him to a preference among the many Solicitations which you must have had. But while I unwillingly trouble you with his request I am very glad of an opportunity to offer my respects & congratulations on the part you are able to take in what appears to us here a very pressing exigency of the State. And have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

your most Obedient 
& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
