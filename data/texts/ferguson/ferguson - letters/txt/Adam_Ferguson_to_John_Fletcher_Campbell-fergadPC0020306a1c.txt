My Dear Sir

Here is weather which puts an end to my Charioteering, I am affraid, for the Season. I have waited a few days to see if it woud change but as what I can use only in fair weather may serve at Boguhan as a provision against foul weather I detain it no longer. We are devouring your fruit, young & old, The Season must have been better with you than here. Otherwise it would not have grown & ripened So well without Fire & Glass neither of which I recollect you employ.

J. Home is to be a week or two longer  in the Country, as I am told, & soon after his return here will go to London. We are most of us Sick in this house but for Sick people are doing pretty well. The bearer will carry your Commands to Town. I am My Dear Sir your most affectionate

& most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
