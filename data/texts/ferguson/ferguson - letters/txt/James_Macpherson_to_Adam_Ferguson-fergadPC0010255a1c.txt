To Col. C.

Sat. 11 at night



My dear Sir

I received both your letters, at once; but I have not an opportunity of communicating their contents, before the post sets out. You have two gain the third, at any rate. We shall [xxx xxx xxx snub the two rebellious, opulent gentry; and give all the crumbs, that fall from the table to the poor. Of this assure them. We have long known our friends there have proved false. Perhaps, they have acted imprudently, as well as ingenerously. Don't, my dear friend, desert your post; but it ought to have been preconcerted, to empower me here. You may depend upon every thing, on my part; for I never sleep, on a friend's business. I am hurried, than I ever thought to have been-on other men's affairs. You know, by this time, that my prophecy has been fulfilled. The post just sets out. Remember me to friends — push matters — and let the event be what it will.

J. M.
