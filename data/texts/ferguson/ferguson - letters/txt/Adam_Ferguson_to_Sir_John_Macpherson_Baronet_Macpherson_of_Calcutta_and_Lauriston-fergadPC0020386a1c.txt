Nidpath Castle 2d April 
1796



My Dear Friend

I send this line without the usual cover because a little possible delay in passing through hands may occasion what I wish to prevent.

The direct call which you mention of my Son Adam to London. I dread for him the Plunge into idleness of which he has too much at Edinburgh. The example of Dissipation & the impression of what is called Genteel in opposition to Bussiness. He was at London some years ago to see the Town for a few days & this I trust is enough till bussiness carry him there at some unlucky Clients Expence. I wish Burnet & he to be diverted from it at present without any apparent negative from me. It is only letting it drop to another Season when it may be less inconvenient. If the matter were in a certain forwardness any restraint from  me might produce more pain than good & therefore I wish even Burnet who may blab not to know what I write. I have been at Edinr for a day to confer with Mr Tait. The Matter of Nidpath now is upon Such a footing that I must be a Bidder for the accommodations wanted & we cannot by any means wish that The Dukes interest should give way to favour. I mean to go as high as the Subject will bear upon me up. And trust only that Ceteris paribus, the keeping of the Castle will procure me a preference in the disposal of its appendages. One thing is pleasant that I now have my chance for the accommodations essential to my Settlement here, that I may or be entirely dissengaged, if these should fail me. If there should be any offer exceeding mine I shall request Mr Tait to let the Duke know my willingness to go as much farther as necessary. I called for Blair to discuss Some of his difficulties, relating to the Concern of Forreign Powers in the internal money Circulation of France; but he was confined with an Epidemic Cold &c &c.

yours most affectionately 
Adam Ferguson
