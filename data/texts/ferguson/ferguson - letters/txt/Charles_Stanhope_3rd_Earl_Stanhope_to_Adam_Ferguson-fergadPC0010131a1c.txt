21 June 1775

Sir

I am just now Favoured with your letter of the 19th & in answer to it, I can only say, that I being no longer one of Ld Chesd Guardians any more than Sir Geo. Saville & Mr Hewet, it must of course belong to our successors in that trust to determine what Person is to accompany your late Pupil in his next tour abroad. It does not appear by your letter that you had any information of our resignation before that which Mr Lovel Stanhope gave you yesterday Sennight, tho' on the first day of this Month (the very next day after Sr Geo. Saville & I had signed the letter of resignation & sent it to Shireoaks to be signed likewise by Mr Hewet), I called upon your friend Mr Adam Smith to acquaint him with it, & to desire him to let you know it, which he promissed me he would do. I am  not surprised at finding that Ld Chestd is to have a new Governor, as I perceived that both he & Mr Lovel Stanhope were extremely desirous of a change, which was one of my reasons for withdrawing from a trust become so troublesome to me & so unserviceable to the young man. I am very sorry that what I meaned for his good has turned out so much the reverse of what I wished for his sake as well as yours. You are in possession of my letter to you dated April 6, 1774, & I dare say make no doubt of my performing the conditional engagement therein entered into by your

most faithful 
humble Serv 
(Signed) Stanhope
