I have this moment received the inclosed Estimate by which the joiner work required in my Class amounts to Â£5. 19, which with about four pound allowed for Paper & Other repairs will I hope put the place in some decent order. This I hope the Comittee are sensible it needs & I beg that you will take the trouble to move the Council that I may be allowed ten pounds for this Purpose. I am Sr

With the greatest regard 
your most Obedient & most humble Servant
