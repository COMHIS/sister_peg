My Dear Friend

what is become of you? Are we to have Politics only in our letters? And has the peace made an end of our lucubrations? I hope that some of these questions will be Answered in the negative and that if we are not in the humour of writing long letters we may have the pleasure of short. Cicero that great Pattern of Eloquence epistolary as well as declamatory when from hope wrote to the Mother of His Family: Si Vales bene est ego Valeo and this with his name at top made a whole letter. I have sometimes attempted to mimick it & think I can do so now. If you are well so am I. I shall think such a letter from you Cheap of a Shilling, & therefore I pray you withhold it not. As for the peace I think it is a more alarming Crisis than any we experienced in the War. I am however far from thinking that War would relieve us.

God bless you & farewell yours &c 
A. Ferguson
