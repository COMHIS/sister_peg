Edinburgh, 12 April 1777

My Lord

I have agreeably to your Lordships desire signified to me by Mr Smith inclosed with this a Copy of your Lordships letter to me dated at Paris Aprile 6th 1774. And am sorry that for weighty reasons mentioned to Mr Smith and which if desired he will communicate I am not at liberty to send the Original. At the same time Mr. Chalmer My Agent at London will receive Copys of that and of two other letters from your Lordship to me compared and attested by a Notary Public and by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Of which with your Lordships permission he will make the necessary use. If My Lord Chesterfield declare that on having these Copys verifyed by a Comparison with the originals he will perform the Condition that is to Relieve your Lordship of the Obligation contained in that which is dated at Paris Aprile 6th 1774 I will go to London and if he give me leave will wait upon His Lordship with the original of that Letter. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect

My Lord 
Your Lordships 
most obliged 
and most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
