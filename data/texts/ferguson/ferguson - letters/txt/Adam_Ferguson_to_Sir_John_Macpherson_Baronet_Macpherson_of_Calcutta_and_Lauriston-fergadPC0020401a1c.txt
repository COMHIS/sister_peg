Hallyards 1st August 1796

My Dear Friend

your Letters always give me great Comfort And in Contemplation of the memoir Sur le project de L'Empereur Leopold in Particular I cannot refrain some hopes that the Nations of Europe will not tamely wait for a peace that is to arise from the Successive & Separate Surrender of every State to the Republick of France. If there were a Congress of Nations, it would Certainly hold a different Language. For the Memoir or project itself does it not need some farther explanation. Two questions may be asked. In what respect does the French Revolution invade the general System of property in Europe? And how is that invasion to be resisted? &c.

Much Obliged for the Plan of The Academy. It is certainly the best place at which our little Friend can wait for his Turn of going to Sea: but as I believe after all that the best Education for a Profession is had in the very scene of the Profession itself & in seeing the Actual duties of it performed. I hope it is consistent with The Plan of the Academy to  charge Pupils for the time they remain proportionally without remaining the year and that we shall be ready to accept of a Berth at Sea when a proper one opens.

In this I understand that there is School on board for young people & that our young Friend will find the proper lessons in Navigation as fast as his years qualify him to receive them. The midsummer vacation may not yet be over at the Academy: but I desire my Friend Burnet in Iron Monger Lane to take your orders respecting Johns Entry & to draw upon me for his outlay payable at the Counting house of Mansfield Ramsay & C Edinburgh, Which is all at present from your

most affectionate Friend 
& humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson





P.S. I live in hopes of hearing from you what is actually doing & mean to repay with what is thinking here.
