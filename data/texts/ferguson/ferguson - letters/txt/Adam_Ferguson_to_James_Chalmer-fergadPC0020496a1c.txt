Dear Sir

I wrote to you about six or eight days ago from Hallyards And my son soon after from this place relating to a change of Designations or Names which we wish to have made on the stock Books relating to the Long Annuity Part of My Brother Roberts Estate of which the Life Rent is bequeathed in Trust to me: But the Reversion to another & hope that matter is in proper train. Meantime pressing circumstances have occurred here that make it necessary for me to sell out the Â£120 four pr Cts which was soon after Michaels last vested in my name. I therefore earnestly request you to dispose of that little Stock & to let me know when I may draw on you for the Produce & wish it may be as soon as Convenient. I am Dear Sir your most

obedt Servant
