Hallyards near Peebles 13 Septr 1798

Gentlemen

I am glad to see the plates so little dammaged as they appear to be. The first execution had little elegance or merit of any sort; And nothing material at present occurs to me for their improvement: but when reduced I shall be glad to have a proof of each separately when perhaps some little addition of names &c may occur.

I should think that the two plates NÂºs 3 & 5 would not need to be reduced as they may somehow be folded into the Octavo Vol. but of this you can judge better. If you should imagine it of any consequence to have a representation of the author there is in this family a Miniature well done which may be copyed for the title page in form of a medallion but such things if not well executed are best omitted. I expect to be in Edinburgh soon when I shall call upon you And Am,

your most obedient & most humble Ser't

Adam Ferguson
