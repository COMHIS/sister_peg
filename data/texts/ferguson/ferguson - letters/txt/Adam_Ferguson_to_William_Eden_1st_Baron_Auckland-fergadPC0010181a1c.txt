New York Septr 8th 1778

Dear Sir,

The Circular Letters being ready to be signed I am hindered by this heavy rain from waiting upon you for any farther instructions. I send you the Letter to Sir William Erskine which is in the same words with the Rest And that to Mr Law which Varys a little. You will please examine both & be so good as Return them if you think proper that I proceed. Observe whether Mr D'Erbage has not made a Misstake in Mr Laws Title.  Will it not be proper that I show the letters to Sir Henry Clinton and Apply for a Serjeant to carry them Round.

I am Dear Sir with the greatest Respect your most Obliged and most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson

P.S. I have thought it is best to send you all the Letters that you may see the number is Compleat.
