Argyle [Square] 5th March 1783

Dear Sir

I wished to have called upon you today but the Air is so cold that I dare not venture into the Streets. Be so good as let me know if you have any accounts from London of any Parcel of the Roman History sent to you or when it is to be expected. I am told of some periodical Publication Review or Magazine in some  of the last numbers of which there is a Life of Mr Logan at Leith: this I mention as a mark of the publication I mean: be so good as send me so many of the late numbers as you have & order the coming numbers for me. I am your most

Obedt humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
