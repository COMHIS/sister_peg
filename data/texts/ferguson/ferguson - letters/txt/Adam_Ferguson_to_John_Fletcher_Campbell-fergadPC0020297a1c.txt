My Dear Sir

I have just now received the inclosed Packet from Lord Glencairn & tho I flatter myself I may see you before you set out for the South I send this packet to find you if possible immediatly that I may not be obliged to send it after you by post. I was glad to be told in answer to my last inquiries that you was gone to the Country.

I am your most Affectionate humble Servant
