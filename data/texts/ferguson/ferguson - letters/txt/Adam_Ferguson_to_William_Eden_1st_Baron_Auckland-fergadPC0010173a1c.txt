Dear Sir

Sir Henry Clinton has given me the draft of a letter he intends to send by the Packet to Lord George Germain in order to be Communicated to His Majestys Commissioners. I beg to know what time it will be convenient to receive it. The Packet will fall down to Sandy Hook tomorrow forenoon. I have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect

Your most Obedient & most humble Servant

Adam Ferguson
