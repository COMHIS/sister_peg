	<div id="fergadPC0020441a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Hallyards</span></span> <span class="date">1<sup>st</sup> August 1798</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Friend</p><p>To begin where your letter ends. <span lang="la">Amicus Amicissimus Indefatigabilis</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> After having Splashed you before with bad Greek<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> you are well off that there is nothing worse now than bad Latin. I do recollect hearing S. J. E.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> desire to have some land Property near his Native Spot but at present know nothing more nor do I know of any fit place at Peebles for your Ward<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>: but shall inquire. There is no property in this Country you know without a Doer as Allan Ramsay<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> used to call the Writers when he was Angry with them which he was indeed for the greatest <ins>part</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> of every hour of his life. If there be any Subject on which to make us your Doer We shall not neglect to do what is proper, And for the Sequel if there be any Sequel it must Come as God will have it in the whims &amp; inclinations of those Concerned. As to the World I am glad <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> you think Buonaparte<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> is gone upon a mere trading or plundering Voyage. In that way he cannot ply long without having the Seas disputed with him. And I patiently wait for the Consequence without Supposing that every encounter of ours must be <span lang="la">Veni Vidi Vici</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> for even the great Julius was a Puppy at a time &amp; more so than has yet appeared of Buonaparte.</p><p>A Combination of Europe including Russia if not properly directed would do us no good. You may possibly remember my Bull<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>. That the proper way of Making War on the great Nation is to make peace with them. In this they are too wise to be caught. I mean their Directors but I think we may make a War as like peace as Possible especially if Europe Combine in it, by keeping them at Bay, leaving them no outlet from home nor goading them with any trifling attacks to keep their attention and Animosities directed abroad. There was an expedition to Ostend<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> And there is one again now the newspapers say from Margate<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> mere proofs that we have not yet learned the Character of our Ennemy or the nature of our Contest: <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> but of that no more. I am no oppositionist and this moment think the nation in a most prosperous State. That is to say we have Men Arms &amp; Spirit, &amp; if we should come to have less wealth we must consume the less either by having fewer mouths or putting less in them.</p><p>I was in Edinburgh for a day or two when your last letter<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> came here to Hallyards. <del>Or</del> Otherwise<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> having now three or four such favours to acknowledge shoud have done it sooner. The Roman History<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> advances but Slowly. The Printers have much Other work when our Law Courts are sitting; Then much of the bussiness proceeds by a kind of paper War from the Press. Five Octavo Vols. are projected but little more than one is yet printed. I shall be Obliged to your German Author<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> for his prolongation Scheme, tho having Annuities &amp; Sellaries<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> from Other People'tis like they think I have prolonged enough.</p><p>I went to Ed<sup>r</sup> to see Our Friend G. Johnstone<span href="/item/fergadPC0020441a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> and was highly gratified. I am My Dear Friend</p><p class="signoff">most affectionately yours <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
