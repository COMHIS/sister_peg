It will grieve me if he should be much embarrassment or trouble to you &amp; therefore I earnestly pray there may be no more of this than your usual temper will enjoy as a pleasure. I am full of Anxiety as usual about the publick &amp; your share in it. Remember I pray <ins>to distinguish</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020400a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> what is proper in Parliament from what would be so, in the executive Council.</p><p>In the first every <ins>thing</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020400a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> that is said goes to Friend &amp; Ennemy alike, whereas an Ennemy should know no more of our mind: but that we mean resolutely equitably &amp; fairly to all Parties. To a person who has long revolved an Idea it appears perfectly <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> clear &amp; in no need of explanation or Comment. To Others it is not so. It would instruct you on this head to have seen a correspondence which I held in the course of last winter with your Friend D<sup>r</sup> Blair<span href="/item/fergadPC0020400a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> on the Subject of your Printed Paper which I sent him at your desire.

How do you steer with Sir William<span href="/item/fergadPC0020400a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> now, there is no man I believe better meaning in the Kingdom: but I doubt he is tired of letters from me as I am of writing them. He does not Win by a popular Surface either within doors or without; yet all parties listen to him with respect &amp; if he were the mover of a reasonable national measure I would have some hopes. It is pleasant to be talking pacifically when <ins>the</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020400a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> tide of war as I hope it may is turning in our Favour.
