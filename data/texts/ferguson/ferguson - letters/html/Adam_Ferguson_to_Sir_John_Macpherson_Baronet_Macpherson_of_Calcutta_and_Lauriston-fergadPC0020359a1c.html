I see from News Papers Since that if I had Stayed but a few days more at Frankfort I should have seen him there: but the Secrets of Kings who can know &amp; I should have thought myself in a Scrape amidst the Scarcity of Horses caused by His Majestys Motions.</p><p>In the way I took by Nurenburgh &amp; Munich I avoided that disstress, came prosperously through the Tyroll and at Verona began to reap the Fruits of my Labours. If you remember the Cimbri or Teutones<span href="/item/fergadPC0020359a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> are said to have performed wonders against Catulus<span href="/item/fergadPC0020359a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> the Roman General in that <sub>neighbourhood</sub><span href="/item/fergadPC0020359a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> And tho it be not of much consequence whether that Tale be exaggerated or not yet I was anxious to judge of its Credibility on the Spot &amp; got on Horse back from Verona for that Purpose &amp; reconnoitred the banks of the Adigé for Some little way.</p><p>So far I had Come Post: but there I fell in a Florentine Vecturino<span href="/item/fergadPC0020359a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> who had brought Some Travellers from Florence.

He Seems to be a good humoured Careful Creature &amp; I am happy to escape the Blustering Postilions of the Ecclesiastical State.

I languish for news from England. I call for News Papers every where <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> but nothing has yet overtaken me more than I knew &amp; in part witnessed in passing through Flanders. I sometimes flatter myself that you will not have waited for Accounts of my Arrival at Rome but will have written under Care of P. Moir or Jenkins the Banker, if you have not, pour l'amour de Dieu delay it no longer. I could not pass this place tho it is much too modern to be any Object to me: I wonder at it: but am not much delighted, Si je n'avais que Soixante &amp; dix Ans as Voltair used to Say I would read its History with great Avidity: but that is for the world to come.</p><p>I went to the Opera last night &amp; was truly entertained with the <del>Audience</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020359a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span>.</p><p>I am My Dear Friend yours most Affectionately</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
