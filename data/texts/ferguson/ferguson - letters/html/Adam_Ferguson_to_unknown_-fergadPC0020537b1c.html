As he stands at the head of the Course of Philosophy a sort of claim seems to result from thence &amp; such a Claim is well supported by the Esteem of People of discernment, &amp; by the Testimony of those who upon the occasion are his Rivals every one of whom I believe if he himself was out of the question woud name Professor Ferguson as the fittest man to be Principal. If being in orders was a necessary qualification which I believe it is not although the office has been generally possessed by Clergymen, M<sup>r</sup> Ferguson has that qualification with this advantage that he retains the Character without being incumbered with any charge out of the University.</p><p>I shall be glad to know My Lord Butes opinion &amp; yours in this matter.
