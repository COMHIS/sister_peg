I have a very great desire to see My Lord Chief Baron<span href="/item/fergadPC0020485a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> but there are at present so many insurmountable difficulties that I must positively defer till I can find His Lordship at Edr. We are taken short here in the middle of Harvest with rainy and most Boisterous weather. There is not a Standing Stook to be seen but all leveld with the ground And the Pease sheaves are bickering over the Country at the Rate of ten miles an hour. As I have neither men nor horses but what the little farm requires the farm is my master and I cannot budge without its leave. Besides I do not know any <ins>safe</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020485a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Road from hence to Arniston but by Ed<sup>r</sup> or at least Lasswaid<span href="/item/fergadPC0020485a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>.</p><p>You will make <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> my excuse for the present to My Lord Chief Baron<span href="/item/fergadPC0020485a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. In going to Ed<sup>r</sup> I but go from one little home to another &amp; that is all I am fit for in the rest of My Life. You Youth have no idea of the bucklings I require Against Cold by day &amp; Cramps by Night; and tho I envy your Ignorance, hope you never will know better from your own experience at least. I am really not a fit guest for any Gentlemans house above the rank of an Innkeeper. There are great preparations in this County for a Ball tomorrow, And a fine saddle I am told preparing to be run for by horses, which have been in Cart or Plough every working day for Six Months past: but I doubt my infirmities will keep me at Home. Here all join in best respects to M<sup>rs</sup> Carlyle &amp; yourself. I mentioned my wish for a Gardiner to you that is a fellow who would do any <ins>thing</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020485a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> he is bid including digging &amp; planting &amp;c &amp;c</p><p class="signoff">Yours most Affectionately <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
