I had not any Conversation nor did I mean to have any with M<sup>r</sup> Dundas on the Subject untill I could say we were in Condition for <ins>his</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Interposition. As the Term of my Boys<span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> necessary Service as a Midshipman draws to a Close, I am desirous to know when &amp; Where &amp; by whom Midshipmens examinations to try their qualifications for a Commission is made. My natural recourse for Advice &amp; direction in this matter should be to His present Captain Newman<span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> of the Loire: But there is something forbidding <ins>in that Quarter</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> by whose fault I know not <del>on that Quarter</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span>. The Boy from his entry into the Service had a succession of Captains partially kind to him &amp; this perhaps had spoilt <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> him<span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, or made him ill brook the treatment for which he should have been prepared of a mere Seaman. I have endeavoured all I can to make him think of his Duties on board only let others behave to him as they may think proper. He was very impatient to be on board a Frigate as being more Active than a line of Battleship And I was looking out for a Captain to whom I might recommend him, When he fell in with the Loire at Plymouth &amp; chose of himself to be transferred to that Ship. Captain Newman is by every Account a brave man And soon after he took My son on board, by Admiral Homes Advice I wrote to thank him for that favour but had no Answer, which with some other Circumstances makes the unwilling to trouble him<span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> any more. As the Loire may be at Portsmouth before my Sons tryal can Come on, I should be glad, if it be not improper to trouble Captain Paton in Such a Matter, that without any thing like Complaint of Captain Newmans dissposition towards us, he would advise how <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> to proceed, and if <ins>he</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> have any opportunity learn from Captain Newman what the Boys behaviour has been &amp; the propriety of his proceeding to be examined at the end of this Term as [<del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> a midshipman. Captain Paton Can at the same time Answer the Questions I put, <span class="lineunder">When Where</span> &amp; by <span class="lineunder">whom</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020469a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> such examinations are made.
