He is confident that he coud in a few Weeks raise about thirty men, of whom Several, he says have already promised to follow him in case he shoud have occasion.</p><p>I have endeavoured to perswade him that it is next to certain your list is compleat <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> and that you must have had many applications for every Commission: but his importunity which I respect in the present Aspect of the Service has overcome my reluctance to take this Liberty with you. He is from Athol, his name Alexr Robertson, about twenty: is of a figure &amp; Spirit that woud suit any Company of Granadiers. But this I am sensible may not entitle him to a preference among the many Solicitations which you must have had. But while I unwillingly trouble you with his request I am very glad of an opportunity to offer my respects &amp; congratulations on the part you are able to take in what appears to us here a very pressing exigency of the State. And have the honour to be with the greatest Respect</p><p class="signoff">your most Obedient <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
