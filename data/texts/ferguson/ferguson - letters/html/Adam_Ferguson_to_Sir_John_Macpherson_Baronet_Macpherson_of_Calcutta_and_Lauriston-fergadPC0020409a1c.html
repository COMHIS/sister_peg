The enclosed is an Answer to My little mans<span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> first letter from Portsmouth, he has seen the Caesar and did not know there was so large a Ship in the world. His letter also includes one from a Poor Cottager here who has a Son on board The Glutton which the news Paper says is just now gone in to Dock at Portsmouth for a little repair. There used to be much intercourse betwixt John &amp; the Parents &amp; there will be great joy at the delivery of this Letter. The older Sailor I guess would risk his life at any time for the younger one. My head is full of news Since I read last nights Paper. What is become of our great &amp; Good Ally the Empress of Russia<span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> <span lang="la">ad Inferos out Superos</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. Will there be any great change of the Scenes. Or who is to be the Empress next: Will the Guards at Petersburgh put up with a Male Sovereign &amp;c &amp;c? What a Report from the executive Directory to the Counsel of 500? Never did State anounce its own extinction in plainer terms<span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. It is a trick on which to found Some new measures of Finance. The news paper bears that it is meant to usher in the proposition of a new fabrication of Paper, if so now is the time for your Traveller to Speak or is it meant as a Ground of exculpation for the Concessions they are making towards Peace. This is what I wish. And I hope that we shall not quench the smoking flax by Screwing up our demands: for I return to my old Doctrine that tho Peace may be friendly to the Nation it is hostile to the present Rulers. And I am still of opinion that the best way of making War is to have peace with them. I think that I understand the State of affairs in Italy through the mist of opposite reports &amp;c And the Party which perseveres, repairing its losses even under Defeat will prevail at last. I have not yet transmitted the Pamphlet to D<sup>r</sup> Blair<span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>; being willing to Spare his Purse I wait for somebody that will bear it for nothing, and in the mean <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> time he may be Otherwise Supplied. I believe the Regions are dancing &amp; that Nova Zembla is now here. We have little or no Snow but the Thermometer at 10° of Farhenheit<span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>, so much for the weather wishing to hear little from you</p><p class="signoff">I am <br />My Dear Friend <br />your most affectionate <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p><span href="/item/fergadPC0020409a1c/txt/003" title="c- [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c-</span>P.S.
