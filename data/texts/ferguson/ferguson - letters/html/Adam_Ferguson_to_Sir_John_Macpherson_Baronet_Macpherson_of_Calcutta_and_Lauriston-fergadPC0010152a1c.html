The Other Intimations in your letter Tho very general gave me likewise very great pleasure. I have waited with some impatience for your Second letter from London in which I hoped to find some time mentioned for your Appearance in This Countrey And this I still hope will be in your Power in this remiss time of Bussiness. You do not say whether you are come home for good &amp; all as John Bull says, or only for Some Special bussiness. <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span></p><p>Nor do I know which to wish. Here is certainly much bussiness to be done relating to the Countrey you have left &amp; I am very glad there is such a person as yourself in the Way to be employed in it. I hope we shall meet before the whole of it is adjusted &amp; I will stretch all my Politics to show how much I wish you Success. We are so disspersed at Present that I have not seen either J<sup>no</sup> Home, Carlyle, D<sup>r</sup> Robertson or Doct<sup>r</sup> Blair Since I received your letter. J<sup>no</sup> Home will certainly pass the greatest part of Winter in London but is here till near Christenmas unless some thing particular require his going away sooner. Your friend M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Kenzie has been settled some time at London as an Agent. I saw him upon a Visit here a little before I received your letter but not Since. I sent your obliging <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> intelligence to Lieut. Bruces Father<span href="/item/fergadPC0010152a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> who expresses the warmest Gratitude and Affection for you. I am extremely happy to find that you come home on the best terms with Coll. Stuart<span href="/item/fergadPC0010152a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. I saw a Letter from His Brother Andrew lately to his purpose. How Politics may steer I know not but this last I will venture to say among the Ablest &amp; fairest men you can have Connection with in this Countrey.</p><p>I write merely to put you in mind of me &amp; that I may hear more of you. My Wife &amp; my five Children join in Respects. I am</p><p class="signoff">My Dear Sir <br />your most Affectionate <br />humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>Since writeing the Above I have received your last letter<span href="/item/fergadPC0010152a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; am extremely happy to find you still think of comeing here. If M<sup>r</sup> Charles Greville will be of the Party that will complete the pleasure.</p></div></div>
