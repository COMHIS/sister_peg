I am much Obliged to you for the Attention &amp;c you have bestowed on my Affair<span href="/item/fergadPC0020322a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, and Am Satisfied with the account you give. The Principle upon which I proceed is implicit faith. If the undertakers are at ease I am satisfied: &amp; with the immediate Prospect which you give of our seeing you shall for the present Say no more.</p><p>I am glad you remember the suggestion of some years back &amp; should be still better pleased to think you in Earnest. Panurge<span href="/item/fergadPC0020322a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is a Sage Counsel &amp; his Scruples lead to the Point: So proceed. We have Still some <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> Sunshine here: but such a North east wind for Some days as requires more Cloathing than ever I carried in the coldest day in Winter &amp; it puts me more in Mind of the See Blink which we read in the history of Green Land than of the Pine Apples you mention. We have better thing Viz. Eggs Butter Cakes &amp; Cabbages &amp; I have forgot every Complaint: but what the Soil &amp; the Climat &amp; the prospect of bad Crops of hay and Corn Occasion. It may be matter of curiosity to you to know that I have sold my house in Argyle Square for the house which I carried you to see at the Siennes<span href="/item/fergadPC0020322a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>, Property for Property without any odds or Ballance.

My Object is <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> to have a farm yard at Edinburgh to communicate with this place. And exchange Dung for Hay &amp; Corn &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. But since I am on the Subject of Property please know that I have three Mares<span href="/item/fergadPC0020322a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; two of them taken [to]<span href="/item/fergadPC0020322a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> the Horse So that by this time next year I may have five Mares besides a She Ass that carrys her Load to town two or three times a week.
