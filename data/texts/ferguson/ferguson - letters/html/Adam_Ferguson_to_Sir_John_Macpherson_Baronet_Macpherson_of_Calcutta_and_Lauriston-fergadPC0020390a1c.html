The Bussines of Nidpath is well over as you have seen by the documents I sent to you. Thank the Duke<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> for me. My new Situation<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> will not be so Ducal &amp; of course more Professorial. We shall move soon but the direction of Letters may continue the Same till farther notice. You cannot long be at a loss for Places about London &amp; therefore Ryegate<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> need not disstress much. Your publick Language is what I have wished from the beginning of the War: but my Doctrines are not fit for Publication that is not fit to be told to the Ennemy as well as a Friend.</p><p>I therefore wish I could hold my Tongue even in Company: for I can Conceive what is said upon the Tweed to be repeated at Paris. The Ennemy ought not to be told what we rely on for that is telling them to what point they should direct their Force. For this Reason Divernois's Pamphlet<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> appeared to me a <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> very improper as well as mistaken publication.</p><p>The French account of the Battle of Montenotte<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> if true is very Allarming: but my Faith is not fixed. They write in the Stile of Quack advertisement &amp; carry the same Caveat<span href="/item/fergadPC0020390a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> to distrust.

I mean for the hand write. Shall I send the book to Ed<sup>r</sup> to go by some conveyance from thence. There is another thing I should not forget.

And if I knew how to forward a Packet would prepare one for him as soon as the plague of changin[g] Quarters will permit. In the meantime I would willin[gly] write a short Line to exculpate myself for the delay that has already taken place.
