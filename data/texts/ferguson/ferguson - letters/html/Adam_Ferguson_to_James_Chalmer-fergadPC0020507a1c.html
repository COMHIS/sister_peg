M<sup>r</sup> Burnett desires to have my directions about the Paper &amp; I have desired him to lodge it with you in hopes that you may find a Safe conveyance for it hither. Perhaps you may know of some Friend coming to this Country or if you think it safe enough <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> by the Post I will not grudge the Postage or if it be safe in a Frank<span href="/item/fergadPC0020507a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>.</p><p>My Friend Fordyce who is not limited as Members of Parliament are to a certain weight will frank it for me.</p><p>But for this there is no haste.

He is not now in this Country And my own Notes do not Satisfy me as to the whole amount.

This Compared with your own Books will be Satisfactory to me on that particular Item.
