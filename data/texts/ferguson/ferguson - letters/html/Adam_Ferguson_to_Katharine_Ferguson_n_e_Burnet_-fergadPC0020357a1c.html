A Town built in the Sea &amp; with Streets &amp; lanes paved with Water with Boats for Coaches &amp; Chariots without which you could not Stir from the threshold of your Door without plunging in the Sea. All this you knew but knowing &amp; seeing I find is different. I am strongly impressed with wonder at such a Place but do not delight in it any more than I do in Wapping<span href="/item/fergadPC0020357a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> or the Pier &amp; Share of Leith. There are numberless Palaces all of Marble &amp; loaded with ornament but my feeling is not pleasure but Still wonder how the Devil they got there. I have lost all relish for what the Sailors call Ginger bread work even in Marble &amp; in the designs of Famous Architects &amp; so I shall bid this Amphibious Town farewell as soon as I have seen what <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> it is the fashion for Travellers to see here or at least some part of it. To Verona I came post, perplexed at every Stage with the exchange of money which it was impossible to know so fast as it changed among my hands, There I met with a Florentine Horse Hyrer who had brought some Travellers to Verona. I made use of his Horses in some little excursions from that Place, Afterwards engaged him to drive me to Padua<span href="/item/fergadPC0020357a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. And we agreed so well on the Road that I have made a Contract to be driven &amp; fed by him on the whole road to Rome at a certain Price. This is a sort of Bargain very common in this Country. We shall travel Slow but I do not want to hurry through a Country of which every part will take my Attention. My Driver Antonio Lapini tells me we shall be a fortnight on the Road &amp; I shall probably write again from some place tho I begin to grudge the Postages of So many letters of which the cost now must be a Considerable Sum: but it is your desire to hear frequently how I go on &amp; you will guess from so much said in this letter without any mention of my health that I have no Complaint. I am certainly stouter than when I left Ed<sup>r</sup> &amp; more independent of <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> little accommodations that used to be necessary to me.</p><p>My Blessing to my Dear Children if they follow all the Dates of my letters on the Map it will help forward their Geography, I shall endeavour as soon as Possible to lead their attention back again through some Route to Edinburgh: but the winter must pass here with me &amp; hope it will do so with you at Ed<sup>r</sup> better than usual. I do not attempt to write to any body else till I get to some end of My Journey. I am</p><p>My Dear Katey yours Affectionately</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
