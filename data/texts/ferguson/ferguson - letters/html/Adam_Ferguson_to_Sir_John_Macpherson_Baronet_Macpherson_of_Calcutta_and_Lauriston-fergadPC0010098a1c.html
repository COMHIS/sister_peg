I have without a moments delay taken this paper &amp; shall not think of any thing else till I have sent off a letter to you. Yours have all come safe at least do not refer to any more than I have received. I coud muster up some excuses for not writing: but mus[t] confess on recollection that the Principal cause has bee[n] a senseless habit of Procrastination. I sometimes waite[d] for one event &amp; then for another. Some months of the long Silence passed even in expectation of seeing you in India<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> &amp; I had the womanish humour of wishing to surprise you: but of this you have heard as I guess from a letter of yours to Doctor Robertson<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and I need not to tell you how that matter went off, the wonder is that it ever <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> encreased a little since you heard of me.</p><p>Bell<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> has got a little Brother<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> about three year old &amp; a Sister<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> about eight months. The little boy has a good deal of Stuff in him, both attention and Vehemence. I begin to recommend him in Time &amp; shall bequeath him your Friendship as the best part of his Inheritance.</p><p>His name is Adam &amp; I shall call him M<sup>c</sup>Pherson too if you please.

The Lustre he wished to assume required keeping you out of Sight. But I hope that the other party concerned has had sense enough to see and acknowledge the truth. The Company has received some blows within this Twelve month<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> &amp; is still upon the Anvil to be hammered into nobody knows what.

The State I hope will leave the Company in all matters to Govern itself, &amp; it will be wise in any Minister to leave them accountable for what happens there but it will be allowable likewise to squeeze them to the last farthing they can pay in consistence with that Interest they ought to have as trade to manage their aff[airs]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010098a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> no opportunitys of writing to me, tho I do not deserve letters yet I enjoy them Sensibly &amp; am anxious about the wellfare of my Friends tho I think my own shoud be taken for granted when they dont hear from.
