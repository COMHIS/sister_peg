When I heard some time ago that M<sup>r</sup> Ruat<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> was engaged to go abroad with Lord Hope<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I was told at the same time that he had obtained leave to keep his Professorship but that The D:of Argyle<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> had insisted upon having the Salary for some other purpose of a public nature during his Absence. If that matter is intirely at the disposal of people here my information is probably right, yours seems to imply that the College will interpose &amp; in that case the matter may be still uncertain. I have seen your Brother<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> once or twice with John Home &amp; that acquaintance has given me great pleasure, <ins>he has</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> a great deal of Lord Elibanks<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> Ingenuity of whom he talked by the hour with great Understanding. Youll have heard of J:Dalrymples<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> Scuffle, it raised a sort of Laugh here against the Scotch Lawyers but Jack<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> by good luck had none of the <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> ridicule but what was forced upon him. The Other sent a Chalenge to hinder his pleading a cause in which it seems he himself was formerly employed in Scotland. Jack went first to M<sup>r</sup> Elliot<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> to advise about this comical Situation, who remitted him to S<sup>r</sup> Henry Erskine<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> <del>by whom</del> <ins>&amp; by him</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> the Answer to the Challenge was dictated viz. That as he was engaged to plead the cause in question on the wednesday following he coud not in honour expose his Life till he had acquitted himself on that trust, that afterwards he woud be ready [to] wait upon him. After sending this Answer Jack stepped in to the Coffeehouse where he met his antagonist &amp; being pressd to an immediate engagement declined it upon S<sup>r</sup> Harrys principle And was called Scoundrel &amp; Coward upon the Spot, which provoked him to draw and a Scuffle ensued in which the Combatants tumbled over chairs <ins>but</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> were prevented from doing more mischief by some gentlemen from the other end of the Room who attended them up Stairs &amp; made up the Quarrel before they parted. I send you this account partly to amuse you in case you have not heard it so particularly &amp; partly on Jacks Account because such things are often misrepresented. <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span></p><p>We have scarcely heard of any thing this Winter but Scotch Authors<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span>, we have been impatient for Smith's book<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> some time &amp; I was vexed to hear Millar<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> had some doubts about publishing it this season, however you will probably know more of that from himself. Here is a History of Gustavus<span href="/item/fergadPC0010030a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> published, which looks as like Hume &amp; Robertson on the outside as can be conceived but it is the most amazing Stuff that ever was seen.</p><p>Remember me to all Friends at Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow</p><p class="signoff">I am Dear Sir with the most sincere Affection <br />your most faithfull <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
