The writer of it will sett his name at the end, and has no other Claim to Credit; but for mer[e] instances of Your Lordships Goodness. The Other Person for whom he ventures to address your Lordship is M<sup>r</sup> William Gardiner<span href="/item/fergadPC0020504a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, who was some years ago admitted to Holy Orders, with a view to his becoming Chaplin to the English residing at Dantzick, where he has accordingly been with great satisfaction to himself &amp; those with whom he was connected; Untill the Calamitous Defeat of the Prussians &amp; the Advance of a Victorious Enemy whose threats of Destruction to every thing English on his Way, will account for M<sup>r</sup> Gardiners Allarm &amp; Escape to his own Country, where he has come with a Wife, and six Children. He now proposes to offer himself <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> at home, and hopes for a kind reception in the Bosom of that Church to which he belongs.</p><p>I was one of the persons who formerly bore Testimony to his merits and am far from having any reason to repeat the concern which I have repeatedly taken in his Wellfare. I trust you will forgive my endeavour to facilitate his Approach to your Lordships Notice. Your countenance must be of Signal benefit to him; And if I could in any degree contribute to procure it for him, should think I performed a meritorious office for a deserving Man. I am too old to be sure that my interposition may not be improper: but trust to your Lordships Indulgence. I continue to write I hope intelligibly: but my sight has so failed that it is with difficulty I read what I have written &amp; must plead your excuse of inaccuracy.</p><p>I still conceive you as what you was and cannot apprehend any decrepitude or weekness whatever.</p><p class="signoff">I have the honour to be with great Respect <br />My Lord <br />your Lordships <br />most obed<sup>t</sup> &amp; <br />most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
