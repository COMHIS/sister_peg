	<div id="fergadPC0020434a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">June 4<sup>th</sup> 1798</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir</p><p>Not knowing your particular address and understanding that you seldom come to Edinburgh I sent a packet for you some weeks ago addressed to the care of our friend D<sup>r</sup> Black, and I make no doubt that it has reached your hands here now.</p><p>That packet contained a book lately finished &amp; published entitled Genealogical History of the Stewarts &amp;c<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. It is the result of the labours of many years, employed first in collecting the materials and afterwards in arranging them and putting them together in the shape they now appear; fortunately I had collected all the materials before the Severe illness with which I was attacked in the month of May last year; but the greatest part of the Arrangament &amp; Composition has been done since that Attack, and tho' it sometimes required an effort to set about it, yet in the whole I found to be an advantage to me to have some object of the kind to excite my attention, and to give me employment without anxiety.</p><p>I was happy to find by a Letter of yours to D<sup>r</sup> Black in the month of August last year<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, which John Davidson forwarded to me while in the Isle of Thanet<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, that you particularly recommened my having something to do that would neither confine nor fatigue. Your sentiments encouraged me to persist in the plan I had adopted. There were in that same Letter some sentiments also on matters <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> of a deeper concern which to my mind afforded much Nourishment and Comfort, and in which I was particularly happy to find that my Notions coincided so much with yours — This is a subject on which I shall be extremely desirous to have some further instruction &amp; discussion at meeting, and I look forward to that period with much earnest desire of its taking place this very season — . Nothing can prevent it but the State of my health; for if at all able to perform the journey it is fully my intention to be in Scotland this year before the Summer &amp; autumn are over. Before making so long a Journey I am first to make the experiment of a Journey to Bath &amp; Clifton<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>, from the last of which places I received very great benefit two years ago. The air there is remarkably Salutary &amp; I shall probably set out about 10 or twelve days hence, &amp; will pay a visit to Bath at the same time. It was toolate in the Season when I went there last year, the consequence of which was that I soon caught a cold &amp; cough which obliged me to desist from either bathing or drinking the waters.</p><p>I have many thanks to return you my dear Sir for all the trouble you took last Summer in acquainting me of the course you had followed yourself in a case similar to mine &amp; in kindly communicating to me everyidea that you thought could be of use to me — be assured that I received with great gratitude <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> your suggestions and availed myself of them.</p><p>The Winter &amp; Spring Season are unfavourable for Invalids such as I have been — I have fought them through tolerably well, but the progress towards recovering the use of my left hand &amp; Left Leg is very slow — They tell me it could not be expected till the warm weather sets in, from which I am now encouraged to hope for much benefit.</p><p>When you have had time to peruse the Genealogical History which has occupied so much of my time &amp; attention I shall be happy to have the benefit of your observations &amp; sentiments. Tell me fairly, whether you perceive in this work any Symptoms of the Paralytick Stroke. I promise to you not to be offended, as tho Archbishop of Grenada was at honest Gil Blas<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> for telling him his real opinion in his Homelies composed after an attack of the Apoplexy.</p><p>I congratulate you upon the good accounts we have lately had from Ireland<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, &amp; the appearance of the Rebellion there being in a fair way of being crushed before the arrival of their French friends. Still I am of opinion that the French will certainly make the attempt &amp; there seems to be no doubt that Buonaparte is embarked on board the fleet at Toulon<span href="/item/fergadPC0020434a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>.</p><p>An excellent Spirit prevails in most part of this Country at present. Let me have the satisfaction of hearing from you when at leisure. &amp; believe me with</p><p class="signoff">real esteem <br />My D. Sir <br />yours &amp;<sup>c</sup> <span class="sig">A.<sup>w</sup> Stuart</span></p></div>
