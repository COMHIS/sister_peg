But I suspect you intended to Mortify Home &amp; me who by the Conduct of the Admiralty<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> are like to be dissappointed of our invasion which we both wished for, he to exhibit his Military Genius<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; I to practice my Philosophy which you may remember is the best calculated for invasions of any Philosophy now extant<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>.</p><p>It seems plain that the French intended by Assembling their force to strike a blow in the Channel. And we are told here it has appeared by some papers taken from Marechal Contades<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> that they had planned an Embarkation from the Weser<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; the Elb<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> when they shoud become Masters of those Rivers, a stroke which woud have probably Surprised us in the North and <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> I make all the use of it I can here to horrify people who think we can be secure without a universal Militia but to no purpose, for Lord Littleton<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> declared where he dined two days ago with the Provost<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> that the only effectual way of serving our Countrey now was by helping to recruit his Majestys regular troops; which introduced great applause to your City Subscriptions &amp; to the ingenuity of Poultney<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> &amp; Crawfurds<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> double feathers.</p><p>Every measure seems to proceed on a Supposition that it is difficult to raise Men for the defence of the Island &amp; those measures create difficultys. I wish by way of experiment that a King of this Countrey woud tell the people that he was threatened with a formidable Invasion, but that he was conscious of <ins>his</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Strength in the youth of Great Britain &amp; desired they would give in their names in every Parish &amp; County. You may easily figure what a list there woud be &amp; what difficulty woud be found in reducing them to the necessary Numbers. I am affraid some of the Methods which are taken to defend us tend to make us not worth <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> defending. But this is perhaps more politics than you have time to read. I woud have troubled you sooner if any thing had occurred worth your Notice &amp; if I had been less burried in Solids &amp; fluids &amp; Ratios<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span>. I like my Situation very well, &amp; begin to admire S<sup>r</sup> Isaac Newton<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> as I did Homer<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> &amp; Montesquieu<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span>, but it is on Condition that he will let me go as soon as I become a tolerable Professor of Natural Philosophy. Home has been little here since I came, before he went last from Edinburgh he showed me a rough draught of the fifth Act<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> which give <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> great pleasure but I am still affraid his Work is too great for his time. I have not heard from Robertson what he is meditating for the Subject of further Works; he probably declines being troubled with many opinions<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '16' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span>. The Wit and ingenuity of this place is still in a flourishing way, &amp; with a few corrections, which however it is difficult to make, is probably the best place for Education in the Island<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/017" title="17 [marked '17' in source]" class="notecall_nts">17</span>. Ch:Townshend<span href="/item/fergadPC0010037b1c/nts/018" title="18 [marked '18' in source]" class="notecall_nts">18</span> has got great Popularity here. Lord Littleton scarcely showed himself. I am D.<sup>r</sup> S<sup>r</sup></p><p class="signoff">With the greatest <br />Respect <br />your most Obedient <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
