He is the son<span href="/item/fergadPC0020309a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> of my brother, one of the honestest men that ever lived. He was born in America, and I have never seen him, but am certain he will not disgrace your protection.</p><p>His father and he are refugees from that lost continent, and partake in the distress which a rooted affection to this country has brought upon many. The son, by the unalterable kindness of G. Johnston, and his insuppressable favour in behalf of honest men, has obtained leave to go to India, though without any destination or appointment. I have reason to believe that he inherits part of his father's sense and worthyness, and is qualifyed for business, and hope you will find protection and good offices for him without interfering with pupils of more expectation. His name is Robert Ferguson, and so I present him to you.</p><p>We are here nearly in the same state as when you heard of us last. The children all well; your namesake John<span href="/item/fergadPC0020309a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> particularly thriving, though he is not yet apprised of his relation to you. The mother and I frail and useless, with little object but that of keeping ourselves alive till the others can do for themselves. In all this I hope you will not perceive any touches of melancholy, for my spirits play very easily upon a Gentoo<span href="/item/fergadPC0020309a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> diet without being tied down to the formalities of any caste or exposed to the caprice or rapacity of any master, whether Christian or Moor . . . .</p><p>I am, my dear sir, your most affectionate and humble servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
