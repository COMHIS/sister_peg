Yes, if Europe be on the verge of madness also what will save it. This Corner I think should be the last to take fire we have the sea to surround us and may have Armies of men interested to preserve order and repel Ennemies: but this is all raving &amp; I write in haste to overtake you at Chester &amp; should have written sooner if I had been at home to receive your letter when it came.</p><p>I went to Ed<sup>r</sup> to meet our Friend Johnstone<span href="/item/fergadPC0020373a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> who at my perswasion came to Consult Doctors. Here the Sky continues to lour &amp; makes me waken from every sleep with something heavy on my mind to be recollected as memory returns. My boys should have much to say to you.

While this country lasts the Navy is likely to become its most important Limb &amp; the career it opens very proper to be run by youth of Vigour especially with collateral Support. <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span></p><p>But as we are, it is best to take our chance &amp; sink or rise in doing our best: the particular circumstances in which the first <ins>step</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020373a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> is to be taken may determine much.
