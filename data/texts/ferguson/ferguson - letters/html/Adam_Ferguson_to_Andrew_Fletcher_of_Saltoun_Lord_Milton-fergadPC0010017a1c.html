His Landlord<span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> has promised me a particular Attention to all his Affairs, &amp; to call for the accounts regularly every week of such people as furnish him any thing here. He has hitherto since we set out given no signs of dissorder, &amp; has been cautious with respect to drinking although I did not appear to restrain him in that Particular. The degree of Melancholy which possessed him perplexed me very much as I am hurried to leave this place both by the winter season coming on &amp; my apprehensions of an Ague<span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> which used to trouble me in this Country.</p><p>As his Spirits seem to have taken a turn to the Better <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> I hope it may Please God to restore him fully to his former applications &amp; Temper of Mind, he seems to be out of the way here of what formerly [<del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> might have missled &amp; disstracted his mind. I thought it necessary however to take what precautions I could in case of the Worst. M<sup>r</sup> Falconer whom I formerly mentioned to your Lordship, &amp; to whom he is recommended by M<sup>r</sup> Crawfurd, promised me to take particular care of him, &amp; as I have informed him in confidence of the former state of his health he will be able to suit his care to that circumstance. I likewise explained his case to D<sup>r</sup> Vandoeveren Professor of Anatomy, in whom I have much confidence as a Physician and as an Obliging Worthy Man, both agreed in thinking that his Present Landlord is a very proper person for him to lodge with, his name is Le Moine, &amp; as I gave him your Lordships Adress, he will not fail to write if any thing remarkable occurs. If your Lordship has any commands for him Please direct (A Mon<sup>sr</sup> Mon<sup>sr</sup><span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Le Moine Maitre de Langues a Groninguen by Holland).</p><p>M<sup>r</sup> Fletcher has given me a Copy of your Lordships last letter to him, and at his earnest desire I have <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> left the Latin Newtestament with him. I have computed his Stated expence for one half year.</p><div class="tablegroup"><table><tbody><tr><td>For Lodging</td><td>____________________G<span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></td><td>30</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td>For Ordinary dinner &amp; Supper</td><td>____________________</td><td>130</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td>For Turf</td><td>____________________</td><td>40</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td>For his Admission in the College</td><td>____________________</td><td>10–10</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td>Professor of Laws Fees 5<span class="lineunder">Ducats</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0010017a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span></td><td>____________________</td><td>26–5</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td>French Master a Ducat a Month</td><td>____________________</td><td>31–10</td><td>_____</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td>__________</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td>268–5</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td>__________</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Which in British money amounts to twenty four Pounds seven Shillings and eight pence.
