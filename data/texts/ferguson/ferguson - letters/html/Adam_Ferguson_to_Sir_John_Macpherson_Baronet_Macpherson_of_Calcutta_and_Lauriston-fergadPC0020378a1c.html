And it stung <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> particularly to think that I had ventured so <ins>far</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> upon mere words of Politeness from His Grace of Q.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> in conversation: but you will See from the inclosed Copy of a Letter<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> which I obtained from M<sup>r</sup> Tait that I was not so much to Blame &amp; did not proceed so far without official Communication. And as I am more reconciled to myself shall wait the event with less perturbation. You would possibly Observe in the Copy I sent <ins>you</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> of a Letter of M<sup>r</sup> Tait, why I am so peremptory in my request to have the warning of removeal to the Housekeeper by the end of January. That is the time of warnings for the whole year. Then habitations are given up or taken &amp; whoever does not provide himself <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> then must wait for another year, And this to me would <ins>be</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> a more expensive <ins>&amp;</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> disstressing Situation than any I ever was in: But as I made a great Effort at my Age to get here, if the worst should <ins>come</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> must repeat the same to get away. M<sup>r</sup> Taits Letter even if I were disposed to go to Law is probably not Sufficient ground for any legal Claim, What he did was for the best: And there was nothing amiss but in having to do with a man of Quality whom the Concerns of little men do not touch &amp; who must not be teased with such concerns or who is perhaps fully exculpated by his State of health<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. I write this merely to correct the Chagrin &amp; impetuosity of what I wrote yesterday, &amp; unless you should find it perfectly easy &amp; proper to stir in the matter to beg that you will leave the Surge to beat as it may. I am glad to know your thoughts on the Prospect of Peace. One Effect the very prospect may produce which is to make Parties in France anticipate the Speculations or practices I Expected from them when relieved from the Pressure of War. I had a letter from S<sup>r</sup> W. P.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> at Oxford in his way to Shropshire. He proposed that my family here should be an Asylum <ins>in Vacation time</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> to his young Nephew<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> upon the loss of his Second Father at Alva<span href="/item/fergadPC0020378a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>. I can no more think of declining it than if I were his nearest Relation. But I have not the necessary Accommodation at present &amp; may not have any better when his Vacation begins.</p><p class="signoff">I am Affectionately yours <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
