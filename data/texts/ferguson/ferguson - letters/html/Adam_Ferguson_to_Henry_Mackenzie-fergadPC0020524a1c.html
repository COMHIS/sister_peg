He said to me, however, with his usual frankness, in the recent communication which I have mentioned above, that he himself had contributed to spoil his friend's <em>History of the Rebellion’</em> (Mackenzie, p. 69).</p><p>‘I had often laid down to him those principles of historical composition on which I afterwards wrote my Roman History; first, that the narrative should be plain and simple, without embellishment; and, secondly, that it should relate only great public events, and trace only the characters of individuals connected with them, without descending into the minuter details of biography. Now these — said Dr Ferguson— were perfectly applicable to my subject, but not at all to that of my friend. The rebellion of 1745 was too unimportant in itself to make a history, without borrowing such ornament from style, and such interest from anecdote, as Voltaire has given to what may be called his Historical Romance of the Expedition of Charles Edward Stuart’ (Mackenzie, p. 69).</p></div>
