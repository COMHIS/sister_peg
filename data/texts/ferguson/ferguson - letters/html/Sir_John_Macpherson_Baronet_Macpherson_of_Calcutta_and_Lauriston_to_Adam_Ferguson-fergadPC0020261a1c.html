The truth is, I was so little disposed to mention that event to any of my friends in Scotland — while I understood you were in a situation not to communicate it to them first — that I never wrote to any person here of it; and the only correspondence I have had with your capital of late, is an answer which I thought myself obliged to send to the Duke of Gordon<span href="/item/fergadPC0020261a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>.

You have naturally a good constitution; and I place every hope in your Highland stamina, your philosophy, and knowledge of nature.</p><p>My friend Carlyle has written me, with an interest in your welfare, and all that belongs to you, that adds, if possible, to my attachment to him. There is a circumstance which, with all his love for you and me, he is not fully known to — it is that I met you when I lost my father, and that your children and I are of but one family. — Farewell. May the power of affection be a power to give health and happiness! If you do not recover your health before I leave this country, I leave it with half my spring of satisfaction and soul.</p><p>Yours ever</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">John M'Pherson</span></p></div>
