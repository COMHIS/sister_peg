In this way if <ins>we</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> neither acquire any thing abroad nor even keep what we have we shall end the War at least with Swords in our hands &amp; <ins>be</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> in Condition to defend ourselves.</p><p>My first Bussiness will be to see Banachar<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> which I hope I shall before this letter is sent off. I will afterwards deliver your Message at Dalkieth<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. As to the <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> letter you left for my perusal perhaps the Silence you enjoin me woud be the best Course if it were practicable. In the first place the Thing<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> Speaks for itself &amp; I am very Ostentatious of it. M<sup>r</sup> Wordie<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> too I have made free with. You were not gone 24 hours from hence when I had a Call for part of what that hopefull place you was to see has cost me<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. I chose to owe you rather than the other person &amp; even ventured to put your Building scheme to some risk at least of Delay. I Deliverd your Canes &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Ferguson delivered your Muslins. I believe really that we are all vain of these marks of your Regard.</p><p>The Principal<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> who is a great Speech Maker chose to expatiate on My part of the matter &amp; without knowing the <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> whole ground said what is true that if my own Son had returned to me in Prosperity I coud not be made to feel it more Sensibly. And I who am not a Speech maker am nevertheless very glad that he has furnished me with this. My Blessing to the Grevilles. I hope to see you &amp; them before Summer begins in the mean time get some franks from them directed to yourself &amp; inclose them to me. I shall write and send packets with the less Scruple that they are not to be paid for. I have had long Conferences with Banchar Since the Above was written &amp; been so much occupied with him that I do not know what is doing by any body else. I do not know what stir there is in the Nation in General or if any body be likely to move in this Countrey. I shall deliver your Message half joke half Earnest <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> to the Duke of Buccleugh<span href="/item/fergadPC0010159a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> &amp; offer to make him Chief of the M<sup>c</sup> Phersons the best feathe[r] if it were fixed in his Cap that is to be seen there. O thou General Howe who will put us again in the Pasture which we had the beginning of last Campaign &amp; which you gave up. You Blockhead or Wor[se]. But I am so tired writing that I can scold no more And so Am</p><p class="signoff">most affectionately yours <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
