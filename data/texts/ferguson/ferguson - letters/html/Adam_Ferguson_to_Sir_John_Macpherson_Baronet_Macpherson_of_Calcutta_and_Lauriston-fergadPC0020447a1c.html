If I had better you should have it: but confinement has given me something worse than nonchalance about writing: this comes from a Scald in my leg<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> which I met with above four weeks ago. The Surgeon always tells me it is haleing but it is never hale. I am nearly of D<sup>r</sup> Thompsons<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> mind about the Ambition &amp; projected Progress of France. I am only surprised that in this mimickry of the Romans so Aspiring a Genius does not stand in Awe of the proverb Imitatores Servum pecus<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. The case of Europe is truly alarming and if there were such a Profession as Physician of State I should be for calling a Consultation to prescribe for the Patient whose life is at Stake, Altho <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> if we are to believe Satyrists &amp; dealers in Ridicule Of all the pretended Markets for Wisdom that of a Consultation of Physicians is the most ridiculous<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. If I were to prescribe myself, it should be a bandage of dead Wall round the whole Circumference of regal France so high &amp; impervious that nothing could come to the Republick from without &amp; nothing perspire from within for at least ten years if in this time there appeared no returns of Sanity I would agree to have the whole interrd under an appropriate inscription. Here lyes a Singular Genius possessed of eminence in every Science &amp; Art. He lived a great statesman &amp; Warriour<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> but died a Coxcomb and now lyes here in sure and Certain hope of raising at the last day to have a dance.</p><p>In failure of the Above prescription my nostrum is that we should take such a Posture of defence as we Can keep till God &amp; Nature <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> cause the Storm to pass away; for I really do not See any thing we can do to hasten its dispellation. The Armies of France will thrive in the midst of opportunities to Scatter their glories about &amp; while they are pressed from abroad with Counterrevolution have such a Noblessephoibia that they will cling to any thing that calls itself Democracy the Reverse of all Armies in the World whose devotion has always been towards a Leader. I am glad H. R. H.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020447a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> keeps so good Company. If you can infect him with a little of your temper so much the better for us all at least for those who may live to See or feel it.
