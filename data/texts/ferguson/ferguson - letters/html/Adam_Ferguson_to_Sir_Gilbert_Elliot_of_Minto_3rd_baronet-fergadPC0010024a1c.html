I would have written immediatly on having the honour of your former letter, If I had not thought it unnecessary to give you that trouble. As M<sup>r</sup> Home had Signifyed my intire Submission to My Lord Butes<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> directions, &amp; my willingness to be employed on any terms His Lordship thought proper. The proposal at first found one great difficulty with me in breaking in upon my <ins>Inclination</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> to Setlement after some years of Wandering &amp; uncertainty, of which I confess I was become tired: But there were considerations enough to remove that difficulty, &amp; the principal one which remained upon My Lord Bute's Letter<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, was a very Sincere Anxiety about my qualifications to fill a place of so much consequence &amp; such tender concern to His Lordship, &amp; in which every circumstance I had access to know, made me think with pain of any degree of dissappointment to him.</p><p>I am extremely sensible of the honour of this Confidence from a Person who is so well apprised of the Nature &amp; importance of it &amp; shall endeavour to profit all I can by the views he will no doubt continue to give me.</p><p>I am just now upon terms for disposing of My Chaplaincy which is but a precarious Possession to one who has tired of following a Regiment, &amp; who in time of service can have little more than the name &amp; the chance of being suddenly called upon from Abroad. If I can get My Colonel<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> to concur in this Affair I shall have litle further connection with the Clergy of Scotland &amp; be under no necessity of appearing in their Character &amp; shall be very glad if that Circumstance is equally  [<del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> agreeable to My Lord Bute.</p><p>Home has left his quarters at Braid<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; lives in Town. He has finished the first Acts of Agis<span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; they are now in the hands of a Copyer, &amp; will I believe be sent to you when done. I dread the difficultys which remain in the Plan from the Mixture of two Objects &amp; Passions, but I have avoided ever discouraging him upon a point which coud not possibly be altered. He wrote you by last Post &amp; is now gone to the Countrey for a Day or two. I hope you will forgive the Length &amp; the freedom of this letter &amp; believe <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010024a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> to be</p><p class="signoff">With the greatest Respects <br />your Most Obliged <br />&amp; most Obedient humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
