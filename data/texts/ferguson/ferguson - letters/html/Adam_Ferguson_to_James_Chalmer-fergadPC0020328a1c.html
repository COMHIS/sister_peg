The Account is to be attested on Oath before a Baron of his Majesties Court of Exchequer &amp; exhibited at the Auditors office on or before Wednesday the 13<sup>th</sup> Dec<sup>r</sup> at two<span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> OClock. Finding from this experience that such requisitions may be repeated I am very unwilling to risk<span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> any material Paper, which I cannot restore in case it should be lost, by any uncertain Conveyance. And therefore hope that the Inclosed Copy of My Account and of the Commissioners Certificate attested on Oath before a Baron of Exchequer here may for the present at least be Sufficient. If not. Please refer to the Attested Copy taken at the War office when it was there presented by you. For the same reason that I am unwilling to risk by any uncertain Conveyance the original Account and Docket <ins>signed</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> by the Commissioners I am unwilling also to risk the vouchers of Particular Articles exhibited to the Commissioners when they passed my Account at New York. All these Papers however if necessary shall be sent to you when required. Most of the disbursements <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> were made upon mere verbal instructions from the Commissioners and as some of them were naturally to be made without any exaction of Receit or Voucher whatever: — it was the more necessary for me to present the Account to the Commissioners for their Approbation while the occasions were recent in their memory. Thus having given this Approbation I hope will be thought to exhonerate me so far as I was bound to Obey their commands. In case however Particular Articles should<span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> be questioned I must trouble you with the <ins>following</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> comment.</p><div class="quoteProse"><p class="proseText">Article 1<sup>st</sup> The Commander in Chiefs <br /> warrant endorsed to Governor Johnstone <br /> The Governors Name on the Warrant <br /> is my Voucher. — M<sup>r</sup> Holland — found a person to convey<span href="/item/fergadPC0020328a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> <br /> Papers to New England &amp; the two Separate <br /> Articles of 20 Guineas each refer to that <br /> Service.
