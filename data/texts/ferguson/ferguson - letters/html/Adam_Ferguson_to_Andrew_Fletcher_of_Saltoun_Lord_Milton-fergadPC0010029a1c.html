	<div id="fergadPC0010029a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">July 11<em>th</em> 1758</span></p><p class="salutation">My Lord</p><p>M<sup>r</sup> Kinloch I believe informed your Lordship, by the last post, of my intention to attend him on his journey Abroad, &amp; I was extremely willing to be of any use to him; &amp; went in to his proposal with little hesitation, till upon recollection I saw the difficulties which might attend by my being out of the Way at this time. He bore with the thoughts of allowing me to return when Necessary: but when I thought of the difficultys which might Attend my Return in time of War, &amp; the inconveniency to him of being left in a Strange Countrey I determined it was better to lay aside thoughts of it Altogether.</p><p>I think Myself extremely Obliged to your Lordship for the trouble I understand you are pleased to take in what concerns me. M<sup>r</sup> Home writes in very Sanguine terms on the prospect of Success in Making an Agreement with M<sup>r</sup> Abercrombie<span href="/item/fergadPC0010029a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>: but his friendship as it may have led him to give your Lordship <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> trouble on my Account may likewise have made him think Other Circumstances equally easy. The Purchase is greatly beyond my Stock<span href="/item/fergadPC0010029a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>; but I am made to believe that the income of the place, with diligence in the Profession might enable me in a few years to clear the debt it woud bring upon me. And if it takes place I am determined to quiet my own Mind against any loss to my friends, by Ensurance. This affair however filled me with a good deal of Anxiety &amp; made me a very improper Companion for M<sup>r</sup> Kinloch; who I am affraid has taken my hesitations amiss. I took the Liberty to Recommend his continuing M<sup>r</sup> Congalton<span href="/item/fergadPC0010029a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>; but he is not determined &amp; Stays here a few days longer, he was told today that the Sailing of the Packet is interrupted by two French Cruizers which ply in the Passage, &amp; that none will sail till a Man of War which is ordered Round comes to protect them. It made me uneasy that he imputed part of his delay <ins>to me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010029a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>: but many things have occurred to me that make it impracticable for me to go along with him as I at first intended. Among others I have been informed that the Gentleman in whose hands the greater part of my little Stock is lodged, has a prospect of Going to America. It is necessary for me to settle my affairs with him before he goes &amp; to have my little funds in readyness if there is any prospect of making a Bargain with M<sup>r</sup> Abercrombie. I am sorry to give your Lordship the trouble of so long a letter but it is owing to my Concern, for the Offence which M<sup>r</sup> Kinloch seems to have taken, &amp; to explain the Reasons of my not being able to accompany him as he wrote I intended.</p><p>Whatever be the Event of projects formed for me in Scotland I shall rest Satisfied in the Proofs I have received of your Lordships Goodness &amp;</p><p class="signoff">am with the greatest Respect <br />My Lord <br />your Lordships <br />Most obliged &amp; <br />most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
