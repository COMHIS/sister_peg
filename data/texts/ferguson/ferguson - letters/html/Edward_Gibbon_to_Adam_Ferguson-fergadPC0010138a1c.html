I am not proud enough to be above vanity, and I have always looked up with the most sincere respect towards the northern part of our island, whither taste and philosophy seemed to have retired from the smoke and hurry of this immense capital<span href="/item/fergadPC0010138a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. Your good opinion, in particular, I should wish to cultivate, and am pleased to understand from some passages in your letter that you are engaged in a work<span href="/item/fergadPC0010138a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> which I am convinced will stand in the same proportion to my imperfect essay as the Roman Republic may be conceived to have done, if compared with the lower ages of the declining Empire.</p><p>What an excellent work<span href="/item/fergadPC0010138a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> is that with which our common friend, Mr Adam Smith, has enriched the public! an extensive science in a single book, and the most profound ideas expressed in the most perspicuous language. He proposes visiting you very soon, and I find that he means to exert his most strenuous endeavours to persuade Mr Hume to return with him to town<span href="/item/fergadPC0010138a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. I am sorry to hear that the health and spirits of that truly great man are in a less favourable state than his friends could wish, and I am sure that you will join your efforts in convincing him of the benefits of exercise, dissipation, and change of air.</p><p>If I were not afraid of being too troublesome, I would desire to inform me by a line, of the particulars of his present condition, as well as of his intentions<span href="/item/fergadPC0010138a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>.</p><p>I am, dear Sir, your most faithful and obedient Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">E.
