	<div id="fergadPC0020284a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edin<sup>r</sup></span></span> <span class="date">15 July 1782</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p>I returned the proof sheets<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> which I received on the 12<sup>th</sup> by the same post &amp; then likewise gave my immediate determination on the question which you proposed relating to the delay of our publication for another year: you will possibly still expect my more deliberate Judgement upon it. The Gentlemen you mentioned<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; most of my literary Friends are in the Country or away in excursions to a distance And indeed if they were here, I could not in this state of a Bussiness so interesting to me be governed by any Other than the decided feelings of my own mind. From my Friends I have already had the most unequivocal encouragement to think as I do in forming the Resolution I have taken. I have been about twelve years employed on this Subject, my Efforts indeed have been directed chiefly to the matter: but the Stile I trust is plain &amp; manly, if it does not abound in the ornaments of Composition it is probably not the less worthy of a Subject which is far above such ornaments. The want of them is an effect not of my failure but of my <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> Choice. I wished even where the grounds of Applause or Censure are evident to leave the application of them to the Reader Content to relate, to state the transaction, &amp; to specify Characters without intruding with my Judgement. This sort of retention which I think proper to History I have not been always able to Observe even when perhaps most proper &amp; the performance must come forth with this &amp; other defects on its head. If it come with reports &amp; prejudices against it: it may not meet with a fair reading but it will sometimes or Other meet with what it deserves &amp; this is all I am entitled to wish<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>.</p><p>Simplicity &amp; plainness of Stile I confess do not imply negligence or want of Care. The Stile of Xenophon<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I believe was studied as much as that of Isocrates<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> tho to a different &amp; a better purpose.</p><p>I pant after propriety &amp; purity more than I ever can reach. I have great confidence in your Ear accustomed to a better Dialect than my own &amp; in your Eye accustomed to the minute inspection of the best writings. I have seized your Amendments greedily for I felt the propriety of them <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> for the most part, &amp; even where I should not myself have felt the necessity of a change, gave way to your better discernment. It was sufficient that I did not perceive my meaning Suffer by it, I took it for granted the expression was bettered. But if the changes I myself have proposed be too much I pray you will admonish me: for I am willing to risk the Publication with such corrections as the press may require or such as are practicable &amp; easy.</p><p>I do take very kindly your Solicitude on the question of delay. You promised that I should be Obliged to you &amp; you have kept your Word. The 12<sup>th</sup> proof sheet is this moment Arrived with the King's Speech<span href="/item/fergadPC0020284a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> for which thank you and am glad to see an End of Such a Session. The post has been late of coming &amp; I wish I may be able to return the Proof with this. In the mean time I finish my Letter</p><p class="signoff">And am Dear Sir <br />your most Obedient <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
