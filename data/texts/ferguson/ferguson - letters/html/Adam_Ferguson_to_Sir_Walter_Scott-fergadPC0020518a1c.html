The little access I personally had to his Noble Father<span href="/item/fergadPC0020518a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> would not justify any such liberty. I should by that means be known to his Grace together with my Son as a Bore<span href="/item/fergadPC0020518a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> for life this word is possibly now out of fashion but it was used in my time to Signify any person or thing that was carefully shunned forever. That man was a Bore who repeatedly teased you with long visits and dryed up the source of every agreeable <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> conversation by continual returns to some tiresome Matter in which he was concerned- he was called in Italian Siccatore a name more easily understood from its derivation than Bore which owed its meaning to the application alone.</p><p>The handwriting is in another hand than Ferguson's, apparently Sir Adam's. Just the signature, very tremulous, is in Ferguson's hand.</p><p>Unless therefore you think yourself Warranted to recommend our Seaman to the Duke of Buccleughs notice as a young man of Merit to be received occasionally into his Graces Company and unless his Grace should find him so upon tryal I should despair of any advantage to be gained by a connection formed in the Character of a Bore. His Grace's Father I had occasion to observe had some predilection for the Character of a Seaman — it is open — it is Candid — it is Manly and not to be shaken [by] trifling difficulties and therefore acceptable as a Companion to his Grace.</p><p>You will pardon any <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> thing that is wrong in this Letter and believe me to be though little accustomed to dictate what others are to write.</p><p class="signoff">Most truely your obliged <br />and affectionate <br />humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
