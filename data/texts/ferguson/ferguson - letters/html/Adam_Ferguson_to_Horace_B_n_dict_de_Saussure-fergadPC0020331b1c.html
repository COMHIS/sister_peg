It is extreamly agreeable to recall the memory of my having been at Geneva<span href="/item/fergadPC0020331b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> though attended with a very sincere regret for the shortness of my stay. Many changes must have happened since the year 1774: but I shall forbear alluding to particulars untill I am better informed. One thing I am happy to Know that you are in the train of pursuing your former studies, and excursions to the mountains, and have at last accomplished the Herculean labour of getting to the top of Mont Blanc, a difficulty, indeed, which I thought must have remained for ever unsurmounted. Your toils are not lost to the observers even of this country.</p><p>The former vols. you published are in their hands and M<sup>r</sup> Hutton in particular is highly pleased and instructed. He has long worshipped the same Divinitys with you and embraced every specimen of stone or earth with a most pious attention. His Ideas are magnificent and what is more precious and more difficult in science formed with a scrupulous regard to reality. You have some account of them in the paper he has furnished me, to be sent by these gentlemen to you. He had directed a copy for you to the secretary of the Academy of Agriculture at Paris of which he is a member: but as the copy I now send may arrive before the other he is willing to indulge my request of having this duplicate for the purpose. He has likewise joined a copy of his theory of Rain<span href="/item/fergadPC0020331b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. It would be a great pleasure to him and to me to pay our respects at Geneva and visit your mountains. There is a company here in which it has often been mentioned, but we should draw different ways some to contemplate the Earth, others the Country ancient and Modern and I am particular to follow the Tract of my Friends the Romans<span href="/item/fergadPC0020331b1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>: but a scheme that has already given so much amusement in Nords is not likely to be executed. I trust I shall have from M<sup>r</sup> Gardener from time to time some account of my Friends of Geneva. In the meantime I beg to be remembered most respectfully to Madame De Saussure and conclude with again recommending these gentlemen to your good offices. I have the honour to be Dear Sir</p><p>Your most obedient and most humble Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
