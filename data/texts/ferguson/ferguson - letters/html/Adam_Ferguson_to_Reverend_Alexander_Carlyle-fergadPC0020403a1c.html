It is in many respects what I should wish: but if I had been free to chuse, would certainly have preferred one with a little more lodging. In order to have a Spare Room for whomever Chance may send on a Stormy night we ly Some of us, three in a Room &amp; others occupy what in the case of a less numerous Family was destined for Servants. In our Chamber of Dine are mounted two Beds so that we can lodge while they agree any two persons of <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> the same Sex &amp; even two persons of different Sexes even if they should not agree provided they are legally Connected: but as for an Inn to which you look for relief there is not within any practicable distance so much as <ins>an</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020403a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> ale house at which to lodge a Servant; So that if M<sup>rs</sup> Carlyle &amp; you or J.

The Hurry of Hay sow making is over; tho so late, my Hay being all meadow Grass; And I have no Corn; what I <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> may have another year, I know not: but should be glad to have your Agricultural Advice from an experience which you probably have bought as well as myself.</p><p>Our Pasture was good in its Season: but is now I doubt on its Wayne. The best I can say is that all concerned Women Men and Slots<span href="/item/fergadPC0020403a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> are in a thriving Condition as to Health &amp;c. The Girls send their most affectionate Complimts and I have reason to bless them for the Chearfulness with which they accommodate themselves to my retiring or sequestered Humour. The Neighbourhood is<span href="/item/fergadPC0020403a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> Sociable &amp; we visit one another in Cartloads. The way is, I am told, for I have not yet seen, to you at one end of the Country &amp; gathering like a snow ball as they roll aloft leave no house unvis[i]ted &amp; no Soul at home in any house to receive a Visit till the following <ins>Season</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020403a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> when the Snow Ball returns again to take them <ins>up</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020403a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span>.
