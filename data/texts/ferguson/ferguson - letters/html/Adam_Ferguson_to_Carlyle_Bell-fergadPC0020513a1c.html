	<div id="fergadPC0020513a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">S<sup>t</sup> Andrews</span></span> <span class="date">21<sup>st</sup> July 1810</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Sir</p><p>I have received your letter acquainting me that Trustees whom you do not name are now deliberating on the publication of my worthy Friends and your late Uncle's Manuscripts<span href="/item/fergadPC0020513a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. Of this you must be sensible that I cannot give any opinion. The small part I saw or with my impaired sight could decipher did not appear to me intended for publication: but rather the amusement of leisure in the exercise of a talent in which our friend excelled, the easy satisfactory detail of familiar occurrences affording a pleasure which his correspondents experienced in every letter he wrote to them. I was so pleased in reading the part you showed me or I could attempt to read but <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> it related to things and persons, most of us so obscure as not to be entitled to publick notice, that I should not be willing to exceed what I believed to be the Authors original intention by publication. And I thought myself the more at liberty to give this opinion, that I found my own name repeated with that partial favour which I always experienced from my friend. It was our lot thro' great part of our time to be neighbours so near as to be frequently together and the opportunities I believe were never willingly omitted by either. We were Socii Criminis<span href="/item/fergadPC0020513a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> in the countenance we gave to the first representation of our friend J. Home's Tragedy of Douglas, a charge for which I was never called to Account<span href="/item/fergadPC0020513a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> But D<sup>r</sup> Carlyle was more known &amp; had more enemies who by prosecuting him for this offence declared him innocent of any thing more likely to serve their spite. We were also accessory to the formation of a Poker Club<span href="/item/fergadPC0020513a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>, &amp; survived most of its members, &amp; thus had occasion of regret which are but ill refrained in the solitary comforts of sequestered Old Age. You cannot doubt my desire to promote <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> the respect which is due to the memory of D<sup>r</sup> Carlysle's memory; But how I know not beyond the testimony if it were called for that I never knew a more steady friend or more agreable companion, and in this I should have so many concurring witnesses as to make my words of little Account. I shall be anxious to know how you proceed, and I beg I may hear from you.</p><p>I am with best respects to M<sup>rs</sup> Bell</p><p>yours most affectionately</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
