In your case I do not see what the Prince himself could do, If you were convicted of a crime his Prerogative could Pardon, but in nomination for Employment in which his Ministers alone are accountable they cannot forgive interference, and if they do not forgive, are powerful to resent. Still further be it from me at Ninety two, to make my first approach to His Royal Highness's Notice, is an act of mere Presumption, and in this <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> trust however Bold you yourself may be in action, will indulge my caution.</p><p>I Prize your Victory in obtaining the kind affection of Walter Scot, and others I could name, more than some Battles however loudly talked of, but knowing how the Admiralty stand affected, my decided wish is that you wait the Chapter of accidents, and discontinue all further applications for the present. For Money it appears to me you have enough if carefully conducted.</p><p>Here too in open arms extended to receive you; and you may perform the part of Chief in my impending obsequies, an office which will there become you[r] and leave no stain behind to blot your future life.</p><p class="signoff">Believe me to be with more concern than I can express <br />your affect.
