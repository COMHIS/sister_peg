John Hume &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Robertson us'd to Extoll him, tho in very Different Motives, but I could never Acquiesce in their Praises.

With much Difficulty I prevailed with him to Undertake it, by the Help of Betty Hunter and John Hill. What can you do better than come &amp; hear it, and Dine with the Society that Day, &amp; rejoice over the Large Collection we Shall Get! Not so Great however as that W<sup>c</sup> D<sup>r</sup> John Erskine<span href="/item/fergadPC0020387a1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '16' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span> raised tother Day, by his Sermon before a New Society for propagating the Gospel among the Heathen.
