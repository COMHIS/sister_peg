	<div id="fergadPC0010123a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Blackheath</span></span> <span class="date">Aprile 29<sup>th</sup> 1775</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Carlyle</p><p>In answer to the two or three letters which you have written to me I can give you five or six which I had written in my own mind to you before I received any of yours. The first was from Geneva where having had the advantage of Lodging in Calvins own house &amp; having access to some of his most Secret Manuscripts I thought myself without Vanity qualified to give you some light into the more Intricate recess's of our Church. My second was from Fernex<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> the seat of that renowned &amp; Pious Apostle Voltaire who saluted me with a Complt. on a Gentleman of my family who had Civilized the Russians<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. I owned this Relation and at this &amp; every Successive visit encouraged every attempt at Conversation even Jokes against Moses Adam &amp; Eve &amp; the rest of the Prophets <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> till I began to be considered as a person who tho true to my own faith had no ill humour to the freedom of fancy in Others. As my own Complt. had come all the way from Russia I wished to know how some of my Friends woud fare<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> but I found the Old man in a state of perfect indifference to all Authors except two Sorts, One of those who write Panegyrics another who write Invectives on himself. There is a third kind whose names he has been used to repeat fifty or sixty years without knowing any thing of them such as Locke<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Boyle<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Newton<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp;c. I forgot his competitors for fame of whom he is always either Silent or Speaks Slightingly. The fact is that he reads little or none his mind exists by Reminiscence &amp; by doing over &amp; over what it has been used to do Dictates Tales dissertations &amp; Tragedys even the latter with all his Elegance tho not with his former force. His Conversation is among the Pleasantest I ever met with, he lets you forget the Superiority which the public <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> opinion gives him, which is indeed great[er than t]hat<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> we conceive in this Island. But he is [able]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> to make me forget all the rest of my letters. The third was from the face of a Snowy <ins>Mountain</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> in Savoye higher than all the mountains in Scotland Piled upon one Other &amp; containing more eternal Ice in its recess's than is to [be]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> found in all Scotland in the hardest Winter. The bottom of this Ice is continually melting in the Valleys like the bottom of a roll of butter placed on end in a frying Pan. It is perpetually Creeping down from the Mountain where fresh Snows continually fall. It hangs in Snotters<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> over Cliffs &amp; Precipices till becomeing too heavy it breaks &amp; with noise louder than thunder makes all the Valleys ring or groan which you please. Masses come down from the mountains sometimes and shake all the Rocks with a force that nothing but an earthquake can imitate &amp; drive the Air out of the narrow Valleys with the force of a hurricane that roots up trees in the opposite hills. I wrote you this letter in the full <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> belief that you are a great Natural [xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> &amp; dissposed to believe every word I say [xxx xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> fourth letter was written from the Inn[er]most<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> parts of Swisserland on a Sunday after church when I saw the Militia exercise<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>. They have uniform clothes and accoutrements all at their own expence which is not a great hardship for it is their only public burden. They appeard to me to be a very effective Military Establishment And as they were the only body of men I ever Saw under Arms on the true principle for which Arms shoud be carried I felt much secret emotion, &amp; coud have shed tears. But to conclude my fifth &amp; last letter was from the Devils own backside in the neighbourhood of This place where every thing from a pair of Snuffers to the Venus of Medicis<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> and the great Diana of the Ephesians<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> is better provided than any where else where every one is bussy enjoying &amp; no one thinks whence it came nor how it is to be keept.</p><p>I thought to have finished all <span class="folio">[folio 3 recto]</span> my letters here but as a frank will carry another sheet I shall take room at least to Sign my name. As I have already written you five letters &amp; this new sheet may pass for another you will please to Observe that you are at least four letters in my debt.</p><p>I am much Obliged to you for your Goodness to my Wife &amp; My Bairns, if I live to return to them we shall not part so easily again. You may believe I was much surprised at the Attempt of the Town Council to shut the door against <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/010" title="j [marked 'j' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>: but am Obliged to them for opening it again. I may be a great looser but <ins>the</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/txt/011" title="k [marked 'k' in source]" class="notecall_txt">k</span> end for which I am persecuted cannot be gained while I have it in my option to return.</p><p>I have been much Obliged to the general Voice that was raised in my favour as well as to the Ardent Zeal of Particular friends. Islay Campbell<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> has given me proofs of Friendship <span class="folio">[folio 3 verso]</span> which I can never forget. Pulteney has behaved to me in every thing as he woud have done at the beginning of the Poker Club. I have allways been an Advocate for Mankind and am a more determined one than ever the fools &amp; knawes are no more than necessary to give Others Something to do. I saw J. Home in Town yesterday Morning he goes as Usual. M<sup>c</sup><span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> is listening to the reports of his History. I do not live among readers and am really ignorant of the General Verdict. I have been living here above three Weeks. A Charming Villa in a Magnificent Scene sed quis me sistat gelidis in montibus Pentland<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> and this I do not say on Account of the hot weather tho it has been for three days the greatest I ever saw in this Countrey. Remember <span class="folio">[folio 4 recto]</span> my Blessing to M<sup>rs</sup> Carlyle<span href="/item/fergadPC0010123a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> &amp; your young ones of whose thriving state I am happy to hear. Tell Edgar when you see him that I have lately a letter from Clarke &amp; shall write to him — meaning Edgar — soon.</p><p class="signoff">I am Dear Carlyle <br />yours most Affectionately <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
