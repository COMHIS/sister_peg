Your letter put that Aversion in a much Stronger light to me than I had conceived &amp; the Particulars I heard this Morning from Lord Linton<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> make me think it a kind of Phrensy. My Opinion is that in all Criminal matters the Law shoud have its Course but how that is to be, in this matter I know not. The Law is terrible in the hands of People that do not appear to delight in its Severitys, &amp; that never Shrinks; but as it is the Fashion here to say we have lost America so I expect to hear that we have lost Scotland but in that case I hope to be Reckoned not among the <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> losers but the lost.</p><p>I am in great hopes nothing will be lost not even the Continent of North America. We have 1200 Miles of Territory in Length occupied by about 3.000.000 [<del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> People of which there are about 1.500.000 with Johny Witherspoons at their head against us And the rest for us. I am not sure that if proper measures were taken but we shoud reduce Johny Witherspoons<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> to the small Support of Franklin Adams<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp; two or three more of the most Abandoned Villains in the world but I tremble at the thoughts of their Cunning &amp; determination opposed to us.</p><p>But so much for Politics. I was very happy in hearing that you had got the Better of your Complaints and <del>of</del> that<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> M<sup>rs</sup> Carlisle <ins>was</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> [<del>xxx</del>] Well<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span>. You may tell that I pant after Scotland as the Hart Panteth after the Water Brooks<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; I have always thought myself within ten days or a fortnight of it<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> but there is always some little remains of Commission Bussiness which woud need an Act of Parliament if the Commissioners did not Act. I thought to have ended the last <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> thing of that Sort to Day but it has become a Question whether it will not need an Act of Parliament &amp; If so I decamp. I shall make no Answer to your fond imaginations about me because I know the meaning of them fully in your mind &amp; how little there is corresponding to them here. I do not despair of the Republic<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, but it is every Man for himself &amp; God for us all. If the Last shoud keep his Post we may do very well whatever part the others may think proper to take. I write to [xxx xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> the Bell-man with a full [xxx xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> to [xxx xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010201a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> [w]henever he Rings. John Home is g[one] to Bath with every Appearance of being well. J: Fletcher went with him &amp; is come back. I hope that John will likewise soon follow for I am told that Bath is tiresome &amp; this Place as far as I could Observe did not dissagree with him.</p><p class="signoff">I am My Dear Carlisle <br />your most Affectionately <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
