Nothing coud happen more agreeable to me &amp; it gives me great pleasure to think that I shall soon have an opportunity of thanking your Lordship in Person, to whose friendship alone I own that piece of good fortune. I shall be very happy if your Lordship continues to have satisfaction from that kind protection you have given me on this &amp; former occasions.</p><p>I was to wait on M<sup>r</sup> Fletcher<span href="/item/fergadPC0010035a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> this morning:but missed him, I shall go to receive his commands before I set out for Scotland which will be as soon as I can settle my little affairs here. The people here are not much alarmed with the French <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> Invasion<span href="/item/fergadPC0010035a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> even People who allow it practicable have no impression of its consequence. I am told that one Miss Grey who is lately returned from Holland says; The French Minister at the Hague advised her not to go to England in a time of such confusion, or if she must go, offered her letters of recommendation to The Officers of the French Army<span href="/item/fergadPC0010035a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. This piece of news your Lordship may not have heard from any other hand, Altho you will certainly hear that a Battle is expected in Westphalia. Prince Ferdinand<span href="/item/fergadPC0010035a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> is unwilling to pass the Weser, &amp; has given it as his opinion that Hanover woud suffer more from the two Armys before an Action than it will lose by Contributions in case his Army is defeat.</p><p class="signoff">I am With The greatest respect <br />My Lord <br />your Lordships <br />most obliged &amp; most humble <br />Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
