I am helped in this resolution by a little fretting uneasiness or inflamation in one of my eyes: but a more real cause is that I am indifferent about the mixed Companies and merry meetings &amp; this is a natural effect when tete a tetes are interesting in a Certain degree. As you are to be so little time in this Country I Scarcely wish to see you any Otherwise than alone. But how is this to be? Your letter does not much savour of the excursion to Alva<span href="/item/fergadPC0020369a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> we mentioned &amp; I am truly reluctant to your <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> breaking any party or deviating from any route merely that I may See you. If in reality you mean no more than to be transported to Ireland &amp; reach your Port by Glasgow &amp; Aire, Peebles is but a trifle out of your way &amp; by Coming here you will see the fine new road which I am told is made from the through of Tweed to the through of Clyde not to mention that both these throughs are themselves well worth seeing &amp; being traveled.</p><p>I have seen a letter from London in which are these words. The greatest Armament that ever went from the Ports of England is now assembling for the West Indies under G<sup>l</sup> Abercrombie<span href="/item/fergadPC0020369a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. I would give a great that I could forget the fate of great Armaments &amp; not think of the Risks now to be run: but he who made the Seas &amp; the Climats &amp; the fevers dispose of us as to him seems best. The French Convention are Surely very impudent in pretending to prescribe to the great <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> infallible Sovereign People of France whom they shall elect<span href="/item/fergadPC0020369a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. There are now two long years past since I have seen very clearly that the Armies are to dispose of France<span href="/item/fergadPC0020369a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. These have shown themselves deeply impregnated with the democratical Furor consider themselves as the joint Sovereigns of the Country &amp; will proceed to dispose of their interest in it as soon as external Ennemies permit. I hope that our fate is not to depend upon what they are pleased to do.</p><p class="signoff">I want to hear from you with some anxiety <br />And Am My Dear Friend <br />Yours most Affectionately <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S. On comparing the dates I find your dinner must have been nearly over before I received your letter, And it is some Consolation to me for the want of your Company that my being of it was actually impossible. I deferred closing this letter till the post of today came. I have a letter from Sir William Pulteney which I hope you will see before you go to improve your understanding in Ireland.</p></div></div>
