I got a pretty good set down for having once written to you that we were not Anxious about the Bairns<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. Her whole concern now is to wonder whether Jamie<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> will know her again. We are grown such fine People here that poor Rustick Jamie will not recollect that he had ever seen us before. I figure to myself that you are now very bussy with the General Assembly, of which I wish you a good deliverance, and offer this wish, with Some Anxiety, as you are left this year by the People who used to take care of you, The Principal &amp; the Lord Advocate<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>: but I hope that the Other Side will have Mercy, &amp; perhaps pull the less if they do not feel any body to pull against them.</p><p>We have had you here sometimes blocked up, &amp; sometimes Bombarded by the Dutch Fleet<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. Bruntisland<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> was actually Bombarded in the last Dutch War &amp; therefore I think you may lay your account with it in this. I think Bayley Cochran<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> ought to have the Causway of Musselburgh taken up and I pray you remember that when a Shell falls <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> near you: you are not to run away but ly flat down till it burst &amp; then take to your heel, as fast as you can, least any more should come. If you can only protract the War for two or three weeks I will come to your Relief &amp; will bring two or three Muskets &amp; Bayonets from Birmingham to Arm my Corps which consists of Peter Anderson<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> a Noted Poacher at Bankhead &amp; George M<sup>c</sup>Lean<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> an eminent marksman &amp; fishing Tackle maker at Edinburgh.</p><p>We are meditating a departure from hence about the 5<sup>t</sup>h of June when our three months at this place will be out. Our Excursion to Clifton<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> was prevented by cold weather, which with very little intermission has continued ever Since, &amp; is the more grievous that is altogether unexpected at a time when people used to retire from the Heat of this Place.</p><p>To do him justice the Sun has keept his Word but this Infernal East wind chills to death while the Sun Scorches. I am now much Agitated with wishes to Comply with People who think it will be of great use to <span class="lineunder">Bell</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> to remain here<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> some time behind us, &amp; with the Difficulty of having her properly placed. We go by London, to make as short a Stay as Affairs real <ins>or</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> imaginary will permit, you may be Sure that I shall endeavour to bring any commands your Friends may have for Scotland.</p><p class="signoff">I am Dear Carlyle <br />most affectionately yours <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>Excuse my Intimacy with Johny Wilkes<span href="/item/fergadPC0020264a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span>. If you should be questioned about your Correspondence with him.
