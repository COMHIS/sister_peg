Even in Answer to your Letter<span href="/item/fergadPC0020302b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I must proceed on Suppositions, which at this distance I cannot verify, &amp; of which even on the Spot I should probably not be a Competent judge. If my Book has had its utmost sale, it would be very improper for me to grasp at a profit to the hurt of my Booksellers: But if the most profitable part of the Sale is yet to come either from the lasting demand for it or from their exertion when it becomes their absolute property, I ought not, in justice to my family, <ins>to</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020302b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> forgo any part of the advantage, that is justly due to me. Mess<sup>rs</sup> Strahan &amp; Cadell have the reputation of fair &amp; <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> liberal dealers, &amp; I must continue to think they deserve it untill I have reason to think otherwise. Please to let them know that I wish to come to a definitive Bargain, &amp; try on what terms they are willing to conclude the transaction. I am willing to accommodate them in deferring the term of payment hereafter as may be fit and reasonable. In other respects our Agreement of Febry 28. 1782<span href="/item/fergadPC0020302b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> I think ought to be the basis.</p><p>As to the Evidence of their having performed the conditions of that egreement I must for the present suppose so, altho if <ins>the agreement</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020302b1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> were to be strictly fulfilled they would probably offer such Evidence as the case would admit of; what that evidence is I know not &amp; must Submit to you &amp; to them. I cannot entertain any doubt of their having taken the proper Steps to secure the copy right to whomsoever it shall be assigned: but as this is probably matter of record, you can <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> easily know it.</p><p>I ought probably to have mentioned in my last, that I mean my letters on this Subject to be confidential &amp; Secret.</p><p class="signoff">I am Dear Sir <br />your most Obedient <br />&amp; most humble Serv't <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
