But as we are at least one of us an Idle fellow at land who neglects the small duties on hand merely because he is overrun with leisure or nothing to do. This however is no new case I have known an Idle man delay Bussiness for months: which a very bussy man never deffers a moment to execute.

Low Born men both in Civil &amp; military Stations to lay their heads in the dust from which they arose. It was much easier to lay the frivolous corrupted pretenders to Aristocracy in the dust than it will be to bury their Rascally Successors. The former exclusive pretensions of Birth to consideration &amp; preferment will never be restored as long any shred of the low born republican Army Subsists. I have been saying so for years tho nobody seems to mind it. Every Army would prefer the Monarchy of a favourite Leader to any Other Government. And the whole French Nation Soldiers &amp; all may be asshamed or disgusted with their tryal of Democracy if they are only allowed to Suppose; that want of birth for the future is not to stifle merit of any Condition<span href="/item/fergadPC0020455a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>.</p><p>So much for the great Scene of Nations.
