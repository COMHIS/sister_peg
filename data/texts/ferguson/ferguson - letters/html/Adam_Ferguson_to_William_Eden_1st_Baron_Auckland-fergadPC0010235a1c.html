He deserves respect for openly standing forth in what I am perswaded he thinks a publick Cause but being myself no Calculator his numbers appear to me <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> too Abstruse &amp; his Reasonings too Shallow.</p><p>I rejoice with you in the Continuance of favourable Events &amp; begin to flatter myself with hopes from every Quarter. M<sup>r</sup> Elliott of New York two Boys<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> are arrived here &amp; give very pointed accounts of Persons &amp; things at that Place.</p><p>21 Feb<sup>ry</sup> 1780</p><p>I had written so far for some days ago when I was interrupted [by]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> a Circumstance which in my Way of Life is enough to put off a Letter for a week together. We were under some Uneasiness here about the Event of political Strugles or rather about the Effect of a new Species of Government forming in some of The Countys of England<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. This Cloud however may pass as Other Clouds have done with a day or two &amp; a Debate. The Account of what has passed confirm this Expectation &amp; I begin to hope that the State <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> will actually profit by the Labours of Opposition. That <del>they will enable</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Government <ins>will be enabled</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> to make some Reforms that might Otherwise be difficult and that our Fleets &amp; our Armys will be employed to find Answers to their Complaints &amp; Accusations. If I had written on, when I began my last <del>I should have</del> I should have<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> given You a Dissertation on the Influence of the Crown &amp; the Supposed Expedience of reduceing it<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, which you have happily escaped. I mean nevertheless to inclose a few Notes I had taken on that Subject after being somewhat puzled with it. I make no doubt but the Questions in Agitation may have given you thought more Apposite to The Times: but this is all you can expect from this Land of Speculation &amp; Metaphysics.</p><p>I rejoice to See Lord Carlisles name at another Publick Appointment<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; feel the <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> Temptation to trouble him with my Congratulations as I did formerly, indeed more Strongly, in reading His Lordships Defence of the Commissioners Manifesto<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>, published from his Speech in the House of Lords.</p><p>My poor Brother<span href="/item/fergadPC0010235a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> who is disposs[e]ssed in Rhode Island &amp; come home writes me that he took the Liberty to Pay his Respects to you &amp; to Lord Carlisle, And I am much Obliged to you for the Notice you were pleased to take of him. He has asked my opinion about the Chance of a Favour or Protection &amp; I am very unable to Advise him, my opportunitys made me feel how much Government had to do in behalf of their Friends in that Quarter but not their means of doing it. I shall however in any proper way that may occur rely on your Kindness.
