	<div id="smitadVF2780429a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="date">19 June 1775</span></p><p class="salutation">My Lord</p><p>I was on Tuesday last informed by Mr Lovel Stanhope, that your Lordship with Sr George Savile and Mr Hewit, had resigned your Trust as Guardians to The Earl of Chesterfield, and had desired His Lordship to make choice of Persons more likely to be of use to him than had been in your Power. That Lord Chesterfield had accordingly made choice of The Duke of Chandos and Mr Lovel Stanhope to act in the Capacity of his Guardians. That a transaction had been some time depending and was then in a manner concluded, engaging Mr De Saint Germain to accompany Lord Chesterfield in his Future Tour abroad, And that after the 24th Instant my attendance on his Lordship would be no longer required. Some days after this communication, Mr Lovel Stanhope wrote My Lord Chesterfield desiring to know, whether I wished to have any thing in writing to the above purpose and informing him that If I did The Duke of Chandos and himself were ready to give it me immediately. In Answer to this question, I wrote Mr Stanhope a Letter of which I trouble your Lordship with the following Copy.<span href="/item/smitadVF2780429a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></p><p>I saw Mr Stanhope a few hours after he had received this letter. He offered me a Copy of your Lordships and the other Guardians resignation, and told me The Duke of Chandos and himself would give me a joint letter to discharge my farther attendance on Lord Chesterfield. That the £100 due at Midsummer shoud be paid. But that he was unacquainted with the other money Articles of my letter, and tho he believed they would fall upon My Lord Chesterfield at last, that he coud do nothing relating to them at present. I have last night received a joint letter from The Duke of Chandos and Mr Lovel Stanhope<span href="/item/smitadVF2780429a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> stating the change lately made in the Guardianship of Lord Chesterfield and notifying that my attendance on his Lordship will not be necessary after the 24th Instant but without any mention of the other Particulars in my letter to Mr Stanhope. I have thought it My Duty, thus to inform your Lordship of what has past since your declining to act as Guardian to the Earl of Chesterfield, And as the Gentlemen who were joined in this trust are now at a distance from each other in the Country I trouble each of you Separately with a Duplicate of this letter. And beg to know whether you have any Objections to my being determined in my farther Attendance on Lord Chesterfield by the Directions of The Duke of Chandos and Mr Lovel Stanhope. I have the honour to be with the greatest respect</p><p class="signoff">My Lord <br />Your Lordships <br />most obliged <br />and most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>PS Your Lordship <br />may be pleased to direct for <br />me at Mr Maynes Banker <br />in Jermyn Street London</p></div></div>
