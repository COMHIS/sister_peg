I went out in the morning since which time I have by accidents been detained abroad. I coud not in my last<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> tell you how much I approved of the Pamphlets inclosed. Tell F.<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> that I had some knowledge of his Subject &amp; I am highly delighted with his Picture. I am affraid we shoud not agree so well about American affairs. I think Greenvilles Stamp Act a very unlucky affair for this Countrey. It has brought on a disspute in which this Mother Countrey <del>Countrey</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> as it is very properly called has made a very shabby figure, And I am affraid cannot mend the matter. We are at once Tradesmen &amp; Soldiers to America<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. When we bully them as Soldiers they threaten not to employ us as Tradesmen. And the Question has now become complicated in the highest degree. I cannot fully Satisfy myself about it: but I wish it had never <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> been Stated, or that Some way coud now be devised of leaving us just where we were in Possession of of<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> all Monopolys with America. I mean the monopoly of Arms of Government and of Trade &amp; leaving them the Right of Taxing themselves, as the exigency of their Affairs &amp; the Influence of Government here coud Obtain. I dont wish to see this Countrey in Possession of many Provinces a Prey to Rapacity And perhaps an Engine to be turned against this Countrey <ins>itself</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span>. If this Countrey is to Subsist long enough till Engines destroy it from Abroad. I have often wished to be on the Spot that I might shoot at the flying follys of the times: but I am Sensible of the<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> disadvantage of being at a distance &amp; not hearing<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> of a Subject untill it is too late. I find that People of Letters think there is a dignity in keeping aloof from present affairs &amp; writing only for Posterity. I am of a Contrary opinion. I believe what is done for today has more Effect than books <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> that look big on the Shelve [. . . . . .]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> coud help to bring the [. . . . . .]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> to some innocent termina[tion] [. . . .]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span></p><p><span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/010" title="j- [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j-</span> <del>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </del> <span class="edComment">[one line is torn &amp; illegible]</span> <del>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</del> <span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/010" title="-j [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_txt">-j</span></p><p>Speak like a Stranger and lose the Effect. I am not at hand to repell first attacks or replys. In short I cannot write a Pamphlet but I will continue to write you what occurs to me. Adapt yourself to the meridian of the Place. If I had written the best that the occasion requires I shoud be averse to be mentioned to <ins>Grafton</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/txt/011" title="k [marked 'j' in source]" class="notecall_txt">k</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> as a writer. I coud come under no Obligations which I am affraid the Step your Friendship Suggests woud seem to Promise<span href="/item/fergadPC0010095a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>.</p><p>I promised in my last to recollect if any thing coud be done: but I have Succeeded very Ill in my Recollection: If I am turned out from being what I am I see nothing I am fit for but to be either King or Prime Minister either of which I woud Undertake without any Hesitation even bad as the times are. I am glad I have not Room to Sign this letter.</p></div>
