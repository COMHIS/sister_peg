	<div id="fergadPC0020439a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Hallyards</span></span> <span class="date">3<sup>rd</sup> July 1798</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Friend</p><p>My Silence is not negligence nor forgetfulness if I had ten thousand of the best letters that ever were written you should have them all: but what I can write from this post, at which my prime consolation is that I have nothing to do but to wait quietly till my time comes. The French I trust, altho they may tease, cannot subdue this Armed nation; and all Speculation on the Subject is at an end. I have in my view a most delightful Kirkyard retired &amp; green on the bank of a running Water<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> &amp; faceing a Verdant hill which in your part of the World would pass for a tremendous mountain: but to me it gives the Idea of Silence &amp; Solitude away from the noise of folly. And so I fancy myself laid there with a Stone to tell the Rustic Moralist<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> what <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> he will not understand; because I sometimes project it should <ins>be</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> in Greek as follows: <span lang="grc">ως εγω τον ϰοσμον εθαυμασα ϰαι συ θεασαμενος χαιϱε</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> but then Again I wish to explain it. And so it should be. I have seen the Works of God, it is now your turn. Do you behold them and rejoice<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. I would speak my verve for Agriculture in Greek also <span lang="grc">Ανθϱωπος ιχνος γεοϱγια</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> And you may judge of my willingness to write when I put all this on paper to you.</p><p>I have not stirred from home for many months past, till lately, when Admiral &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Nugent being at Edinburgh, led me thither to gratify my sense of their kindness to my little Seaman<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>. And I am Still the more Convinced that Nugent is the most amiable faultless Creature upon Earth. In that excursion I met our Friend S<sup>r</sup> John Sinclair<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> in the Street: this put it in his head to write to me since my return hither, an Account of works he is projecting to promote what <ins>he</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> calls Statistical Philosophy. I hinted that his project is too vast: but he tells me that his mind <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> is made up, to draw it on a great Scale and on as perfect a plan as possible. And that he never Startled at any difficulty that could be Surmounted ever Since he collected as far back as the year 1780 One thousand &amp; two hundred men &amp; in one days time made a road of Six miles long over a mountain till then thought impassible<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>. The fact is that he has got an instinct to be doing which other people ought to know how to employ without turning him out of place. Altho I have so many excuses for writing so seldom, I am not willing to Allow you any, so I pray when you are writing however let there be a Scrap for me even if you should not be able to tell me what is become of Buonaparte<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>. By the by is that a genuine <ins>Prussian</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> paper<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> in answer to the French demands, which we have in the news paper. It is menacing and I do not see how the great Nation can give way to it without appearing to be cowed. They certainly meant to gall us &amp; to secure the Co-operation of Prussia against us by transferring Hanover<span href="/item/fergadPC0020439a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span></p><p class="signoff">&amp;c &amp;c your most Affectionately <br /><span class="sig">A.
