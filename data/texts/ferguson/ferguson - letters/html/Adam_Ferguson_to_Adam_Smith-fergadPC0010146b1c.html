I have been greatly at a loss on this occasion for want of my usual Counsellor M<sup>r</sup> Davidson<span href="/item/fergadPC0010146b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. After mature consideration it appears to my friends here as well as to myself that a requisition to produce the original of Earl Stanhopes letter to me dated at Paris Aprile 6<sup>th</sup> 1774<span href="/item/fergadPC0010146b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> may be a matter of Course in Bussiness But that it may proceed likewise from some degree of Suspicion that my Copies of this Letter particularly that transcribed in my own hand writeing and sent to the Earl of Chesterfield in January last is not exact. That if the original letter were by any Accident lost the Suspicion might produce Insinuations of which I shoud in that case have no direct refutation. And that in this View of the matter I ought not to expose this letter to any Avoidable Accident whatever. If My Lord Chesterfield declare his Intention in case my Copy is verifyed by the original, to fullfill the condition which will Relieve My Lord Stanhope of his Obligation, I will if he give me leave without loss of time to go to London and wait upon his Lordship with the original Letter. In the meantime I send by this post Copys of this and two Other letters from My Lord Stanhope to me Collated and Attested by a Notary Public and by The Lord Provost of Edinburgh in hopes that this may be Sufficient. These Copys go in a Packet to M<sup>r</sup> Chalmer who will communicate them to you and otherwise employ them for any purpose they can Serve. I return you with this Lord Stanhopes letter to yourself and send to His Lordship the Copy he desires in my own hand writeing very sorry any difficulty shoud hinder me from sending the Original.</p><p>I am My Dear Smith Your most affectionate and most humble Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
