And referred him to Mr James Chalmer of St Albans Street London who woud receive his Commands, being entrusted with My letter to his Lordship and my other Affairs at London. Mr Chalmer Called upon Lord Chesterfield several times, left my letter together with one from himself, waited some weeks for an Answer, and has since at my desire communicated his Business to Mr Lovel Stanhope who has declined taking any concern [in] it. So that having no expectations of an Answer to my Applications from The Earl of Chesterfield I am under the dissagreeable necessity of stating the fruitless attempts I have made, and of referring the whole matter to Your Lordship that some better way may be devized for comeing at the knowledge of Lord Chesterfields mind. I transmit this letter by Mr Chalmer that in case appearances be more favourable than they were when he wrote me last, he may not trouble Your Lordship with it.</p><p>I Received last Summer by Mr Clow<span href="/item/smitadVF2780433a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> at Glasgow A Copy of Mr Simsons Posthumous works<span href="/item/smitadVF2780433a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> which he told me your Lordship did me the honour to order for me and I beg that you will now tho so late accept of my Acknowledgements. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect</p><p class="signoff">My Lord <br />Your Lordships <br />most Obliged <br />and most Humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
