I supposed you indeed to have trouble enough of that Sort without any addition from me. I hope however you will give me leave to Assure you that your kindness has not been unobserved &amp; to thank you most Sincerely. I have never had an opportunity of knowing the young man personally but have ever had the best accounts of him and trust he will deserve your Protection.</p><p>Cap<sup>tn</sup> Burnett<span href="/item/fergadPC0020336a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who is just now <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> Setting out for London undertakes to forward this line from me. M<sup>rs</sup> Ferguson you may believe joins me in thanking you also on his account. She regrets very much the Reports of your Intended return to Europe; but as the Time will depend on yourself or My Lord Cornwallis your Friends in this Country will expect it with pleasure. If I have the honour of being remembered by His Lordship I should beg leave to offer my most humble Respects, My best &amp; most Affectionate wishes have ever attended him in every Bussiness in which he has been engaged.</p><p>As to news we have many things new in Europe of which the Gazettes will inform you as they do me. Not only a new Town and a new College of Edinburgh but a new Republick of France<span href="/item/fergadPC0020336a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and a new States General of Brabant &amp; Flanders. People ventured to tell the Court of France that in abeting the <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> Revolt of America they were setting a dangerous example to their own people: but even the persons who said so did not distinctly perceive or believe it. The Noblesse of France have had a greater fall than the King. It is resolved that for the future there Shall be no distinction of Persons in that Country, whether they can keep to their resolution is a doubtful question. The experiment is matter of expectation to us for a twelve month[s] or two to come &amp; to you a matter of Curiosity at the Arrival of every Ship from Europe. I think that what they are engaged in will make them better neighbours both in Europe &amp; Asia than they have been heretofore.</p><p class="signoff">I have the honour to be <br />My Dear Sir <br />your most humble &amp; most Obedient <br />Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
