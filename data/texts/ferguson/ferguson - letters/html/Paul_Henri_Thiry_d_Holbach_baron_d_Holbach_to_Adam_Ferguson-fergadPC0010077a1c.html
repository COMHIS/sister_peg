	<div id="fergadPC0010077a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p>I received with the deepest sense of gratitude the undeserv'd favour of your kind letter dated the 3d of March<span href="/item/fergadPC0010077a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>; tho', your valuable work<span href="/item/fergadPC0010077a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is not yet come to my hands according to the orders you were so good to give your Bookseller in London, I shall expect the favour you intended with thankfulness, and even with patience; having had the good fortune of getting the perusal of a copy belonging to an acquaintance of mine. I found it answering completely to the high opinion I had conceived of your great abilities and ingenuity, by the testimonies given of you by Mr. Andrew Stewart, Colonel Clerk, and several other gentlemen from your country, with whom I have had the pleasure of conversing in this place. Tho' you don't seem to set a high value on theory, it must necessarily precede practice, and I think that given in your grand performance, by enlightening the human mind, may contribute to render their practice better; for I don't despair of the perfectibility of mankind: I believe they have been mere children in matters the most important for them. I am of opinion that the greatest part of our distresses arise from our ignorance, and give me leave, Sir, to tell you sincerely, that I am persuaded that your valuable work is, and will be, very able to dispel the foggs that hang over our understandings. We are always indebted to great men for useful inventions, that are the fruits of their invention and theory. What they have found out with a great deal of trouble, becomes by and by popular; and by degrees truth, when become general, influences the general practice, even in spite of those who think it their interest to keep mankind in the dark. As to the virtues that preserve nations, or at least put off long their decline, I believe they must be the effects of learning; when morality shall be clear'd, or rescued from the hands of those who have made it their study to render it obscure. I think every individual will be more virtuous, and even the powerful movers of men will find it their own interest in governing according to the rules of reason. I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Sir, yours, &amp;c</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">d'Holbach</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span>, <span class="date">15th of June, 1767</span></p></div>
