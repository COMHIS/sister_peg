C-'s coming of age, would be esteemed a sufficient one</em>.’</p></div><p>My Father has a notion that he was informed, either by you or by Dr Smith, very soon after your leaving Ld Chesterfield that Mr Lovel Stanhope had said, that <em>he</em> supposed the annuity promised you would fall on Ld Chesterfield at last; but as my Father cannot now find the Letters he then received, he would be glad to know whether you recollect any such saying of Mr Lovel Stanhope.<span href="/item/smitadVF2780451a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span></p><p>My Father desires his Comp[liment]s to you; and you will be so good as to remember me to Dr Smith, if he is with you at present.</p><p>Believe me with great Esteem <br />Sir, your most faithl. humble Ser.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Chevening</span></p></div>
