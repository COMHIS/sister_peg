It does not appear by your letter that you had any information of our resignation before that which M<sup>r</sup> Lovel Stanhope gave you yesterday Sennight, tho' on the first day of this Month (the very next day after S<sup>r</sup> Geo.

I am <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> not surprised at finding that L<sup>d</sup> Chest<sup>d</sup> is to have a new Governor, as I perceived that both he &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Lovel Stanhope were extremely desirous of a change, which was one of my reasons for withdrawing from a trust become so troublesome to me &amp; so unserviceable to the young man. I am very sorry that what I meaned for his good has turned out so much the reverse of what I wished for his sake as well as yours. You are in possession of my letter to you dated April 6, 1774, &amp; I dare say make no doubt of my performing the conditional engagement therein entered into by your</p><p class="signoff">most faithful <br />humble Serv <br />(Signed) <span class="sig">Stanhope</span></p></div>
