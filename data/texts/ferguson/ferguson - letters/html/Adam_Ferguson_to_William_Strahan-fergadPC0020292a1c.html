Together with the errata I inclose The Table of Contents, the five books transcribed from the printed Copy &amp; at every chapter referring to the page. The <ins>contents of the</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020292a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Sixth book are transcribed from a Manuscript &amp; could not refer to the page: but this defect the Compositor I hope will Supply from the Printed [<del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0020292a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Copy which by the time he comes to this will have been in his hands. How far such a table as I send will be useful or acceptable to the reader you will please judge &amp; determine accordingly; my health &amp; engagements would not permit my attempting any thing more.</p><p>These particulars will find room enough in the first Vol. The Order as appears to me Should be the <span class="lineunder">Dedication — The Table of Contents — The</span> <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> <span class="lineunder">Advertisment</span>,<span href="/item/fergadPC0020292a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> which I sent you some time ago <span class="lineunder">about the Geographical names</span>.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020292a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020292a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> And the Errata.

I was willing to hasten the arrival of the Plates as much as possible &amp; therefore have sent them by the Stage Coach paying the Carriage here. I have had them carefully packed in two Cases, to bear the violent motion to which they will be exposed in the Coach. If they should go safe there will be some danger in opening the Cases as every Vacuity is filled up with Slips of wood glued in. The Plates are wrapped up in Paper &amp; this will help to distinguish them in forcing open the inner box which must be done very cautiously to avoid mischief be so good as caution the workman who opens them of all this.
