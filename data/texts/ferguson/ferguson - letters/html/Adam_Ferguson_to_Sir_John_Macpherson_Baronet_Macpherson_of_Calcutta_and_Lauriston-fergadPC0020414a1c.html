I owe some letters to our Seaman<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> at Spithead which I now endeavour to repay. If you meet with Rear Admiral Nugent at London pray tell him that the Little Protegé began his letter from Spithead in these words, <span class="lineunder">It is impossible to express how kind captain Nugent is to me</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>. And you may be assured that I feel no less than he does. Congratulate the Admiral for me on his Promotion<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. And Congratulate me too on the nomination of Rhoddam Home<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> to the Caesar on the prospect of his Flag being Removed to Some Other Ship. I <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> should long Since have written to my Relation Robert Ferguson in Bengale: but the Vis inertiae<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> is so Strong that without some particular occasion I should never have acquitted myself of that Debt. The occasion on which I write to him now<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> is no less than the Death of his Father A most respectable &amp; original Brother of mine Whom if you had Known you would have thought a most precious Acquaintance. With the wreck of a Little fortune saved from the Revolution in America he has contrived in his will by little Annuities to asswage the Necessities of a Number of Poor Relations whom indeed he was Supporting for years past. As the Publick has become a painful Object at least to us in this Corner who can do nothing for it, I am glad to have any thing else to write. That your Farm<span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> should be pleasant and promise to be profitable I rejoice. Mine is I <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> believe like the general System of Nature itself better fitted to our exigences than we are always willing to acknowledge; that is; it is fitted to our exigences by giving us something to Complain of &amp; by never allowing us to rest. What an exotic man you are who never complain. If you should ever again be in the humour of coming to this Countrey it will be matter of great joy to me.</p><p class="signoff">I am My Dear Friend <br />your most Affectionate <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p><span href="/item/fergadPC0020414a1c/txt/002" title="b- [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b-</span>P.S.
