My second was from Fernex the seat of that renowned &amp; Pious Apostle Voltaire who saluted me with a Complt on a gentleman<span href="/item/voltfrVF1250426a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> of my family who had Civilized the Russians. I owned this Relation and at this &amp; every successive visit encouraged every attempt at Conversation even Jokes against Moses, Adam &amp; Eve &amp; the rest of the Prophets till I began to be considered as a person who tho true to my own faith had no ill humour to the freedom of fancy in Others. As my own Complt had come all the way from Russia I wished to know how some of my Friends woud fare but I found the old man in a state of perfect indifference to all Authors except two sorts, One of those who write Panegyrics, another who write Invectives on himself. There is a third kind whose names he has been used to repeat fifty or sixty years without knowing any thing of them such as Locke, Boyle, Newton &amp;c. I forgot his competitors for fame of whom he is always either silent or speaks slightingly. The fact is that he reads little or none, his mind exists by Reminiscence &amp; by doing over &amp; over what it has been used to do, Dictates Tales, dissertations &amp; Tragedy, even the latter with all his Elegance tho not with his former force. His Conversation is among the Pleasantest I ever met with, he lets you forget the superiority which the public opinion gives him, which is indeed great[er than w]hat we conceive in this Island . . . .</p><p>I am Dear Carly[l]e</p><p><span class="linelast">Yours most affectionately,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
