	<div id="smitadVF2780430a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Chevening</span>, <span class="date">21 June 1775</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p>I am just now favoured with your letter of the 19th<span href="/item/smitadVF2780430a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and in answer to it, I can only say, that I being no longer one of Ld Ches[terfiel]d['s] Guardians any more than Sr Geo Saville and Mr Hewet, it must of course belong to our successors in that trust to determine what Person is to accompany your late Pupil in his next tour abroad. It does not appear by your letter that you had any information of our resignation before that which Mr Lovel Stanhope gave you yesterday sen'night, — tho' on the first day of this Month (the very next day after Sr Geo. Saville and I had signed the letter of resignation and sent it to Shire-Oaks to be signed likewise by Mr Hewet,) I called upon your friend Mr Adam Smith to acquaint him with it, and to desire him to let you know it, which he promissed me he would do. I am not surprized at finding that Ld Chestd. is to have a new Governor, as I perceived that both he and Mr Lovel Stanhope were extremely desirous of a change, which was one of my reasons for withdrawing from a trust become so troublesome to me and so unserviceable to the Young Man. I am very sorry that what I meaned for his good has turned out to be so much the reverse of what I wished for his sake as well as yours. You are in possession of my letter to you dated April 6 1774,<span href="/item/smitadVF2780430a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> and I dare say you make no doubt of my performing the conditional engagements therein entered into by your</p><p class="signoff">most faithful <br />humble Servt <br /><span class="sig">(signed) Stanhope</span></p></div>
