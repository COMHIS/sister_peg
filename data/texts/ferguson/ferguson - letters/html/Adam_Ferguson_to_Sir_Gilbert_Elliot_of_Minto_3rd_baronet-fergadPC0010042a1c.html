I who only mix a little news paper politics with Natural Philosophy<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> have been extremely embarrassed with the affairs of the Nation ever since the news of last week<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; as far as news papers go there is nothing you <ins>do</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> likely to escape me for some time to come. With all the interest I take in the public however I would not have troubled you at this time, if some notions I have about a private Affair did not press me so strongly that I cannot possibly refrain. Home sets out for London this day<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> it woud be ridiculous for any body to think that applications in his favour are necessary where he is going, but I am extremely Anxious that his friends should <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> think as I do of the manner of directing their kindness. It is for this reason that I trouble you and endeavoured to press the same notion on him at parting. A Subsistance altogether precarious however honourable for the present or big with hopes was never to <ins>my</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> mind. Every man of Worth shoud have a firm bottom on which he may stand however narrow it is &amp; I may say of myself what I believe is not true of him that I never coud love a man intirely whilst I remain in absolute dependance on him or at least that I never coud act if I did love him so. Give me ground enough to stand on as my Predecessor Archimedes<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> said &amp; then I will show you what kind of Mechanic I am. I therefore wish most earnestly that every Other act of Friendship for Home was thought of no avail till he is fixed in some moderate reasonable or even little provisions sure for his Life &amp; if his fortunes carry more let him pay at hazard for the rest as much as he will. You will forgive me for <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> Supposing for a moment that you can need to have views suggested to you on a<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> like this. But I am anxious that not[hing] escape you &amp; am perswaded that doing wh[at] call Justice to one of the most Amiable<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> that ever existed since mankind had a being is of more consequence than half the Public measures you will pursue this Twelve months<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> for more than that proportion of them will result finally in getting more Victuals for John Bull<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, for which I do not care one single farthing.</p><p>I most earnestly beg that you woud make Homes Friends beware of that most cruel Idea that if he is secure or independent for Life he will write no more. Make them beware of too great a fondness for their own Generosity to keep him in a situation that woud make them feel it every moment. None of these cautions may be needed &amp; that will be a happy case; but if you are Satisfied of the truth of what I say I wish you woud not partys [. . . . .] concerned depart from it for [an inst]ant. I know that tho Home is the bold[est] in the World in interposing for Others he is shy for himself &amp; may not see<span href="/item/fergadPC0010042a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> in so strong a light as he shoud do &amp; I wish you woud add your Authority to what I said to him about it. Whilst he continues in his present Situation or any like it I shall always think of him with pain, as a man who is misplaced &amp; who meets with injustice, if he shoud otherwise meet with all the marks of kindness that ever was bestowed on Man. I must repeat it again that half your Public measures will not be of this consequence.</p><p>Adresses are preparing from every corner &amp; from what I can understand the Militia may be inserted in some places merely to pay Court.</p><p>What blessed days these are. I begin My Labours again in a few days. I am with The greatest respect</p><p class="signoff">My Dear Sir <br />your affectionate <br />&amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
