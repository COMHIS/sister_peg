I continue to mend<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. &amp; I hope soon, taking the whole complicated case of my Diet<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; recovery together to be in a better Animal as well as Intellectual State than I was before my late Illness.</p><p>I am hastening to put my Papers on the Roman History in a form to go out of my hands whenever it is proper. And shall proceed to fill up my Lectures<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> to the same Purpose And then I shall be at Liberty to <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> commit myself entirely to the newspapers &amp; watch the Affairs of the Nation. In the mean time I Observe it is said that Lord Cornwallis has joined Arnold<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>: but to what Purpose I know not And the thing certainly merits consideration. I have been regreting all the Way in my thoughts on the Road that our Friend G<sup>l</sup> Clerk is not in Parliament. A person may as well think to be of consequence in France without being a Gentleman as here without being in Parliament. I own The Case occurs in both Countrys: but what a difference there is here. A Private Gentleman may hunt a Minister for a whole Winter without being able to see him. A Member of Parliament demands an Interview at pleasure. A Private Gentleman can never see a Minister except formally &amp; at an Audience, a Member of Parliament can catch <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> him familiarly in the House &amp; fix his Ear in the time of dull Speeches &amp; in the Intervals of Bussiness. The Minister shuns the Application of Strangers. He covets the Courtship of members of Parliament <ins>And fears to offend them</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>. In Parliament without making long Speeches a person can discountenance nonsense with a very few Words And a Person who has once made an able Appearance in Parliament is a person of Authority within the whole Kingdom. Fools commonly consider every one who differs remarkably from themselves in Private as a Madman. But the Publick one way or Other where they are the judges distinguish between a Fool &amp; a Man of Parts &amp; Sense. I have Sometimes thought it might be made a question at the Robin Hood<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> or some Other Such Place.</p><p>Who incurs most contempt a Fool among wise men or a Wise Man among Fools? If the wise Man should not take care to Manage <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> his Superiority he will be in the worst case of the two. In Parliament a Man of Parts is independent of Fools or more so than anywhere else. I hope that you will admit these Arguments as of Force And now that G<sup>l</sup> C<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Health &amp; every Circumstance makes the Ordinary<span href="/item/fergadPC0020266a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Attention of Parliament easy to him I earnestly wish that some opportunity were seized to get a Seat: but of the matter I can say Nothing farther And say so much only to set you a thinking of it in case it has not occurred. I am Dear Sir With the greatest Respect</p><p>your most affectionate humble Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
