	<div id="fergadPC0020539a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p>Since My last M<sup>r</sup> Goldie Principal of the College of Edinburgh is dead. I have already given you my opinion about the choice of a Successor.</p><p>The Clergy <ins>I am told</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> lay Claim to any Preferments of this kind which fall in our University, as being the only rewards which their order has to expect &amp; the only Objects which are left to excite their Emulation in Literature or any Other kind of Merit by which they may distinguish themselves. <del>This claim of theirs however does not exclude M<sup>r</sup> Ferguson who thoat present a Professor in the College is likewise an ordained Minister.</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> But without <del>excluding their Pretensions</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> any prejudice to their Pretensions I think it unjust to exclude Professors in Universitys from the hope of <ins>the same</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> preferments <ins>which</ins> may <ins>likewise</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> excite their Emulation to distinguish themselves. Literary merit shoud meet with its reward in them as well as in the Clergy. Clergymen are <ins>frequently</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> called to fill every kind of Vacancy in our Universitys and are made Professors in the different branch[e]s of <del>Education</del> Science.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> And I do not think that the <ins>little which I am told some of them pretend to have to be</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> the exclusive <del>Claim of being</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> promoted to the head of Colleges shoud be acknowledged.</p><p>The practice hitherto has not been Regular in their favours. For at S<sup>t</sup> Andrews and Aberdeen there were likely three heads of Colleges who were Laymen.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/010" title="j [marked 'j' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span> One M<sup>r</sup> Young<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> a <ins>Layman</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/011" title="k [marked 'k' in source]" class="notecall_txt">k</span> was head of one of the Colleges at S<sup>t</sup> Andrews before the two Colleges were United. At Aberdeen M<sup>r</sup> Blackwall<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who is lately dead was Principal of the one College and M<sup>r</sup> Chambers<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is now Principal of the other <ins>and both Laymen</ins>.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/012" title="l [marked 'l' in source]" class="notecall_txt">l</span> <del>were likewise exceptions to the Pretended Rules</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/013" title="m [marked 'm' in source]" class="notecall_txt">m</span> And I do not apprehend that any difficulty coud arise from <ins>this quarter</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020539a1c/txt/014" title="n [marked 'n' in source]" class="notecall_txt">n</span> in the present case.
