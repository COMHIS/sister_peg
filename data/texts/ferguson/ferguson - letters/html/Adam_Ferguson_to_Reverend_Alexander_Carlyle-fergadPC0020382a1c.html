It is a whimsical Situation we have got into to be Sure: but has its Alurements both within doors &amp; in the <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> neighbourhood, where the People as you are told are very good to us. All the women who have drunken husbands very earnestly press me for their Houses. I am sorry to understand M<sup>rs</sup> Carlyle now has so little occasion for my Services: but look forward with great pleasure to the time when we may hope to see your Sobriety here: for that is what I understand you mean when you say you have lost all your convivial faculties. The Air is good the Water is Good The Earth is dry And the Castle is lodgeable there is nothing amiss but the Slow pace with which I get into Possession of Country accommodations.</p><p>They are yet to come at <del>Christmas</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020382a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> Whitsunday<span href="/item/fergadPC0020382a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp; Martinmas<span href="/item/fergadPC0020382a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> <ins>next</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020382a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> &amp; even then little more than will keep a Cow &amp; a Horse.
