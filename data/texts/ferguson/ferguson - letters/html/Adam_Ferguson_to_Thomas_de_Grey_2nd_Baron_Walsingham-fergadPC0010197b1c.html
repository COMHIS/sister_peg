The Minute which you have done me the Honor to communicate to me appears to refer to extraordinary Services in his Journey to Fort Stanwick &amp; repeated Voyages to Rhode Island, the last as Commissioner to enquire into the Loss of the Gaspee Sloop. For these Services he would probably have thought himself entitled to some Reward or Compensation, even if he had continued to receive the ordinary Emoluments of his Office in the Jerseys.</p><p>If he actually now receives, as I understood from Sir Henry Clinton, £400 a Year on the Army Contingencies, he considers this <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> Allowance probably as a Subsistence given to him as such Allowances are given to other displaced Officers of the Crown in America, as some Compensation for the Interruption of their usual appointments in the Provinces. If Chief Justice Smith really receives £400 a year it will be stated in the Army contingencies, and if not so stated, I must suppose that there is some Mistake in that Matter.</p><p>The very great Expence of living now at New York makes £400 a Year a very scanty Allowance, and may very naturally appear, to Chief Justice Smith, not enough to preclude him from stating any Claim he may have for former extraordinary Services.</p><p>I have the Honor to be &amp;c</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>Thos De Grey Esq<sup>r</sup> &amp;c &amp;c</p></div></div>
