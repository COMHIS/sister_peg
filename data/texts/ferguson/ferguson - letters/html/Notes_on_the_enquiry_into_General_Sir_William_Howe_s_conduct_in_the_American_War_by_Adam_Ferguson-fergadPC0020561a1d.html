	<div id="fergadPC0020561a1d"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p>The immediate Object of the Inquiry now depending before the Commons of Great Britain is Whether Sir W<sup>m</sup> Howe is a Man of Capacity &amp; has ably conducted The American War.</p><p>This Question is of very little consequence to the Publick &amp; may be decided in any Way without affecting the State otherwise than by promoting <ins>or defeating</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> the Purpose of Party.</p><p>The Inquiry however has led to Questions of more Moment.</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> How far the State has a Right to Employ the Ordinary means of War in order to Suppress a Rebellion which has outlived all the Grievances from which it was Supposed to Arise, &amp; how far his officers have already Abused these means.</p><p>An<sup>d</sup> What Prospect <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> remains to Great Britain of being able to effect a Reunion with Her Colonies.</p><p>As to the 1<sup>st</sup> Question. It is not easily conceived how Subjects in Arms against Their Sovereign &amp; in Alliance with his ennemys, should be entitled to more favour than the Subjects of a Forreign Prince at War upon some problematical Questions of State.</p><p>The Subjects of a forreign Prince involved in a War by their Sovereign may not have incurred any personal Guilt by that Circumstance And it is not Lawfull to Distress them except so far as that is allowed in order to Disstress the State to which they belong.</p><p>But Subjects in Rebellion incurr a Personal Guilt &amp; may be disstressed not only in order to disstress their Community but likewise in order to Punish Their Crime.</p><p>When a Controversy nevertheless, whatever may have been its origin, <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> has been brought to the ordinary Issue of War. It must be conducted according to the Rules of War least Innocent Subjects employed against Rebels &amp; Criminals shoud be exposed by Retaliation to Suffer what Justice permits to be inflicted on Rebels &amp; Criminals Alone.</p><p>War is supposed to permit Reprisals, Circumvention, Force, Bloodshed Slaughter &amp; a Variety of means that may be employd to force an Ennemy to Justice.</p><p>In the use of these means however the operations of War are limited with a View to the End, &amp; <ins>to</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> the just measure of Hostilitys that may be necessary to Obtain it.</p><p>No Act of Hostility not even the smallest Molestation to the Person against whom it is employed is Lawfull Except so far it is necessary to prevent a Wrong, or <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> to redress an Injury.</p><p>The Principle from which the Rules of War are derived is. That a Person apprehending wrong may defend himself at the Expence &amp; Hazard, and <ins>if necessary</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> even by the Suffering &amp; Destruction of the Party who wrongs him.</p><p>And the Source of the Limitation is likewise Obvious: That he is not to do harm wantonly nor beyond what is necessary to preserve or recover his Right.</p><p>The first &amp; most ordinary Species of Hostilitys in case an ennemy persist in the Wrong, Are seizing his Person &amp; Effects or His Territory &amp; in case of Resistance, Military Execution &amp; Slaughter.</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> — A Party Aggrieved has a right to make War at the Expence of His Ennemy, And therefore has a Right that [<del>xxx</del>] is<span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span>never Contested, to raise Contributions, to exact <span class="folio">[folio 3 recto]</span> Supplys of every Sort, as far as they are Necessary to Support, the War or as far as they tend by distressing the Ennemy to compell the Ennemy to Justice.</p><p>Armys on the Territory of an Ennemy sometimes Spare the Countrey from a Consideration of Safety &amp; Expedience to themselves.</p><p>It is expedient to Protect a Countrey <del>in</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> which <del>an Army is to make</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> is the Seat of War, in order to enjoy its Resources which might be exhausted at once if the Countrey was laid Waste or exposed to Rapin.</p><p>An Army endeavours to Avail itself of the Resources of an Ennemys Countrey either by Exacting regular &amp; Measured Contributions under a perfect Security to the Persons &amp; remaining Property of those who pay those Contributions.</p><p>Or by means Still more Mild by requiring the Ordinary Supply of the Camp at a Marketable &amp; Reasonable Price. <span class="folio">[folio 3 verso]</span></p><p>If the reasonable dem[and] whether of a free Contribu[tion] or Marketable Supply a[re] refused it is undoubtedly Lawfull to Exact Complyance under Pain or Military Execution. And Countreys in the Power of an Ennemy for the most part are so well apprised of what they have to Expect that they never refuse such Contributions or Supplys.</p><p>2 — Every Person that is Found in Arms is Supposed to Resist &amp; may be proceeded against accordingly. And Every House from which Hostilitys are Committed may be destroyd &amp; is accordingly destroyed to deterr the Peasant from Practices that Approach to assassination &amp; hurt particular persons without affecting the General Cause.</p><p>3 — An Army being to Withdraw from a Countrey or <ins>being to</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/008" title="h [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> leave it to be occupied by an ennemy may if Expedient <del>not only</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/009" title="i [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> break up high Ways <span class="folio">[folio 4 recto]</span> demolish Bridges. Fell Timber. Destroy Forrage Provisions, &amp; every Species of accommodation that would facilitate the operations of An Ennemy. This is Practised by Armys on the own Territory of a Friend &amp; the Right was never Questioned on that of an Ennemy.</p><p>When a Party at War is to Abandon a Possession that may be instantly turned against him by an Ennemy, it is undoubtedly lawfull to consult his own Safety by destroying Such Possession.</p><p>Thus not only Arsenals <ins>&amp; Magazines</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/010" title="j [marked 'j' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span> with their Contents of Arms Amunition stores and Provisions.

No contributions were exacted, No Markets were forced, The Peasant lived undisturbed within Reach of our <del>Guns</del> Cannon<span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/013" title="m [marked 'm' in source]" class="notecall_txt">m</span> &amp; denyed us that Relief &amp; those Supplys which a Single discharge could have forced, or Amply punished him for refusing.</p><p>Must Great Britain forego every Right that is not to be recovered upon such Maxims of Lenity <span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/014" title="n- [marked 'n' in source]" class="notecall_txt">n-</span>or rather Timidity<span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/014" title="-n [marked 'n' in source]" class="notecall_txt">-n</span> as these?—If so Every Obstinate Ennemy or Rebel may forever with hold her Rights.</p><p>But the American Rebels must not be flatterd.</p><p>Every Species of War that is lawfull against an ordinary Ennemy is lawfull against them. <span class="folio">[folio 5 verso]</span></p><p>And as the Passions of men are more Violent in Civil and Domestic than in Forreign Wars, The Obstinate American Rebel who professes to throw himself into the Scale of France, against his own Countrey, has more Severitys <ins>to</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/015" title="o [marked 'o' in source]" class="notecall_txt">o</span> dread from his Injured Countrey than any Forreign Ennemy would have to dread in the result of an Ordinary War.</p><p>The Congress now Usurping the Government in America &amp; Violently restraining the People from returning to their Allegiance &amp; Duty, Intend the deepest Wound that ever was aimed at Great Britain, and appea[r]s to be Animated with peculiar Sentiments of Animosity &amp; Rancour.</p><p>The Consequences of their Pretensions to Independence, Are the Dissmemberment of the British Empire by a Separation of the whole Continent of <ins>North</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/016" title="p [marked 'o' in source]" class="notecall_txt">p</span> America from the <span class="folio">[folio 6 recto]</span> Crown of Great Britain: The Consequent Exclusion of Great Britain from the Naval Resources which she had <ins>with so much Care</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/017" title="q [marked 'p' in source]" class="notecall_txt">q</span> Studyed to acquire <del>with so much care</del><span href="/item/fergadPC0020561a1d/txt/018" title="r [marked 'q' in source]" class="notecall_txt">r</span> on the Other Side of the Atlantic.
