I suppose, however, that of all the opinions on which you have any curiosity, mine is among the least doubtful. You may believe, that on further acquaintance with your work my esteem is not a little increased. You are surely to reign alone on these subjects, to form the opinions, and I hope to govern at least the coming generations. I see no addition your work can receive except such little matters as may occur to yourself in subsequent editions. You are not to expect the run of a novel, nor even of a true history; but you may venture to assure your booksellers of a steady and continual sale, as long as people wish for information on these subjects. You have provoked, it is true, the church, the universities, and the merchants, against all of whom I am willing to take your part; but you have likewise provoked the militia<span href="/item/fergadPC0010142a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, and there I must be against you. The gentlemen and peasants of this country do not need the authority of philosophers to make them supine and negligent of every resource they might have in themselves, in the case of certain extremities, of which the pressure, God knows, may be at no great distance. But of this more at Philippi<span href="/item/fergadPC0010142a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. You have heard from Black<span href="/item/fergadPC0010142a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> of our worthy friend D. Hume. If anything in such a case could be agreeable, the easy and pleasant state of his mind and spirits would be really so. I believe he will be prevailed on at last to get in motion, and to try the effect of Bath<span href="/item/fergadPC0010142a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, or anything else Sir Jno. Pringle may recommend. I have said more on this subject to Mr Gibbon<span href="/item/fergadPC0010142a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, who, if you be found at London, will communicate to you. If not, I hope we shall soon meet here. And am, &amp;c</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
