She never could come to me at a more favourable time, I have pasture for ten or twelve Beasts &amp; am made to expect that I shall cut a thousand Stone of Hay: Such a Stock as yours I know well is apt to overgrow &amp; be felt grievously at a Pinch of Backward Grass, my first impulse was to take away the old mare as soon as possible: but on recollection that, besides her first unexpected Production, she is possibly nursing or to nurse a Second, this may not be proper. I might relieve you of the Colt at any rate if I knew how to have him Conveyed but I am affraid he will neither lead nor Carry. Be so good as order what should be done &amp; if any careful person could be <ins>found</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020395a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> to lead the little animal here, I would willingly pay Costs. All the above Profusion of Grass is not <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> at the Castle as you Suppose but at a new post<span href="/item/fergadPC0020395a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I have just taken having evacuated the Castle. I remained there till near Whitsunday in the same state of uncertainty I mentioned to you about Christmas: The Grounds there were coming to be let, <ins>but</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020395a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> without any prospect of my being accommodated on any reasonable terms. The neighbouhood of a little Town brought competitors with whom, it would have been very imprudent for me to contend. The Land Lords<span href="/item/fergadPC0020395a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Passion was for Grassum rather than Rent &amp; tho I offered £707 Grassum<span href="/item/fergadPC0020395a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> &amp; a Rent of £22 for about forty Acres part Rocky &amp; covered by Wood. I took occasion of the Report of a higher offer to withdraw mine &amp; laid hold of this little Settlement at Hallyards upon the Manor on the other Side of the Tweed from Nidpath, where I am accommodated at once as above with a Small House, indeed; but excellent Offices &amp; some fine Pasture of which some small part inclosed. Letters directed to Nidpath will find me but my new direction is at Hallyards By Peebles.</p><p>I am My Dear Sir</p><p>your most Affectionate &amp; most Humble Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
