Matters here were then &amp; still continue in some dissorder but I hope that from this time forward I shall be able to draw my appointments pretty Regularly &amp; shall in a little time endeavour to replace what you so kindly favoured me with. My Journey to this place has furnished no adventures worthy of being told. It has been extremely pleasant &amp; tho we have lately spent a month in making the Tour of Swisserland I am not yet tired of Wandering. That Country is Curious by Nature by Art &amp; by Politics. In the Aristocratical Cantons<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> all Councils are Secret &amp; the people are well Governed nobody knows how. As for the Democratical<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I could be mad enough to put on great breeches and let my Beard grow if the people would admit me to be one of them. In the meantime I think myself very happy in the Prospect of returning to Scotland after I have passed a year or <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> two in this way of Life I hope not unprofitably.</p><p>I think I am very fortunate in the Character of My young Friend<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> as well as in the whole of the Connections I have formed. He has Vivacity Parts &amp; good Disspositions, a little spoilt perhaps by certain Circumstances but if every thing were already Perfect there would be nothing further to be done.</p><p>I am now writing on the Very Spot where Calvin<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> reformed the reformed Churches this being the place of his house &amp; Garden where we Live &amp; I feel the warmth of my Zeal sufficiently against all reprobates altho I shall not indulge it in this letter. I am likewise in sight of Voltairs Castle another worthy tho of a different description. I have seen him but it is probable can tell you nothing new of him. He is worn to a shadow but has all his Vivacity &amp; his Genius Intire. The last proof he has given of it is a Satire in Dialogue between Pegasus<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; himself which I think is perfectly equal to what he used to write. He writes frolicking Cards to Lord Chesterfield<span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; calls him, mon droit honor <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> honorable Seigneur &amp; Signs himself Le Pauvre Diable de Ferney. A Geneva Lady had a dispute with him lately about the Trinity, When she had finished a Speech he Answered</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText" lang="fr">Jusqu'a ce jour Iris la Trinité <br />Dans mon Esprit n'a pas fait fortune <br />mais unissant les trois graces en une <br />Vous confonde[z] mon Incredulité</p></div><p>He entertained us with a Philippic against France and its Bigottry. Lord Chesterfield said he should go to england, <span lang="fr">Ah si je n'avez que Soixante &amp; dix Ans Said</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0010111a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>.</p><p>So much for Voltair.
