And notwithstanding the pretended date or present form of the French Offers to North-America yet it is notorious that these were made in Consequence of the Plans of Accommodation previously concerted in Great Britain, and with a View to prevent our Reconciliation and to prolong this Destructive War.</p><p>But we trust that the Inhabitants of North-America connected with us by the nearest Ties of Consanguinity, speaking the same language, interested in the preservation of similar Institutions, remembering the former happy Intercourse of good Offices and forgetting recent animosities will shrink from the thought of becoming an Accession of force to our late mutual Enemies; and will prefer a firm &amp; free and perpetual Coalition with the Parent State to an insincere and unnatural Foreign Alliance.</p><p>This Dispatch will be delivered to you by Doctor Ferguson the Secretary to His Majesty's Commission and for fuller explanation and discussion of every Subject of difference, We desire to meet with you either Collectively or by Deputation, at New York, Philadelphia, York Town or such other place as you may propose. We think it right however to Apprise you, that His Majesty's Instructions as well as our own desire to remove from the immediate Seat of War in the Active Operations of which we cannot take any part, may induce us speedily to remove to New York; but the Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Land Forces<span href="/item/fergadPC0020552a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> (who is joined with Us in the Commission) will if it should become necessary either Concur with us in a Suspension of Hostilities or will furnish all necessary Passports and safe Conduct to Facilitate our meeting and we shall of course expect the same of you: If after the time that may be necessary to consider this Communication and transmit your answer the Horrors and Devastations of War should continue we call God and the World to Witness that the Evils which must follow are not to be imputed to Great Britain. And we cannot without the most real Sorrow anticipate the Prospect of Calamities which we feel the most Ardent desire to prevent. We are with perfect respect</p><p class="signoff">Gentlemen your most Obedient and most humble Servants</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></span> <span class="date">June 10<sup>th</sup> 1778</span></p></div>
