It has enabled me to communicate with some of the learned men who join me in applauding the Eloquence &amp; the appropriate terms of that composition. The Authority of D<sup>r</sup> Gregory<span href="/item/fergadPC0020525b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> has no need of such Supports but I am fond to mention it. I thought your Fathers Birth<span href="/item/fergadPC0020525b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp; mine had been more scarcely dated but I see his preceded Mine by two whole years — altho I have survived so long to become my own Monument perishing you will say — but only more so — as less permanent than some other Grave Stones. I remember to have seen in Italy Miles &amp; Leagues of ancient high ways strewed on right &amp; left with continual Vestiges of Monuments now destroyed or in ruins with scarce a Name to Mark for whom they were intended but your fathers Memory is independent of such materials more fortunate than Tacitus or Livy. His works entire remain for <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> ages indefinite to shew that in his time the British Stile in able hands was fit to Emulate &amp; cope with theirs it were too much vanity for me to think the opportunity will last of giving judgement how little I had profited by the Example he set me of liking talents &amp; intellectual Eminence. My way is now directed to the trackless Grave &amp; there My course Should terminate but for the happy thought that there is somewhat after death to which this nursery &amp; school of human life is no more than preparation or a prelude.</p><p>Meantime however I remain &amp;c</p></div>
