	<div id="fergadPC0020361a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">23 March <br />1795</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Friend</p><p>I know very well the disinclination to write letters when one cannot trust the Post with whatever comes uppermost &amp; have myself the folly to harp on publick affairs of which no part is entrusted to me; so wish I could let them alone; take my share of the profits when they go well &amp; leave the Glory to whom it belongs. Go, as the Scripture says and do <span class="lineunder">thou likewise</span><span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. I have mentioned your Respects to those you mention &amp; we are all happy in the thoughts of seeing you in Summer: But it is an ugly trick with you of the South to put off your Journeys north till July August or September when our rainy Season is come &amp; little pleasure on the Roads. May &amp; June tho less convenient in Some respects are Certainly preferable &amp; so I think you should have as much of the Summer before you as possible at the outset. Poor Blair has lost his Wife<span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> within these few Weeks &amp; I am sorry to say my case is so likely to follow. <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span></p><p>M<sup>rs</sup> Ferguson is now so intirely worn out with Continued disstress to which a considerable degree of fever is now added that little hopes remain of her recovery. On seeing her just now my impression is that no one ever recovered whose Countenance &amp; Aspect was so much altered. You will forgive me for troubling you with this particular I have reason enough to know that nothing Concerning <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> is indifferent to you. Doctor Black is also far gone in a Consumption &amp; neither it is likely will long Survive the Other. But people who live long like me must be Content to be the last. Of my Books I would rather work on Philosophy<span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> than Roman History to which I have little heart in the present State of the world altho it is that to which the bookselling trade directs my attention.</p><p>In Philosophy I should be doing what I am more likely to continue when I quit this scene of things. But the truth is I do little of any thing &amp; expect no Attention if I were to do more. Here we have been living in Nova Zembla &amp; are yet travelling through Lapland<span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>: Many old people have died <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> but I am yet as well as you saw me. My thoughts are much set at present on retiring to the Country for the remainder of my Life. I have no bussiness and as little pleasure in Towns, And it is wonderful how little occasion I have for the bellows of Neighbourhood to flow up the little fire that is left in me. I cant yet cry and talk admire and blame by myself &amp; so I did in my Sulky through all the Roads of Germany &amp; Italy. When you Come here I shall not have the same liking to Solitude. I think with great pleasure that our friend at Florence<span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> has got the innocent people of Tuscany into some shelter from the Storm that threatens.</p><p>When you write be so good as mention the Respect &amp; Affection with which he impressed me. My Blessing to the Grevils I hope Charles has forgiven that I claimed a 40 years acquaintance with him at my time of Life the difference of ten or twelve years goes for Nothing. If Robert be a favourite so much the better for the Court, I could Submit to be a King myself at that Rate. I am My Dear Friend your most Affectionate &amp; humble Servant</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>The Event apprehended has taken place. M<sup>rs</sup> Ferguson died about an hour after the within was written<span href="/item/fergadPC0020361a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>.</p></div></div>
