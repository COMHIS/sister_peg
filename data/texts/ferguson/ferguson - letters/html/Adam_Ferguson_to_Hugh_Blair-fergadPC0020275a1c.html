	<div id="fergadPC0020275a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span>, <span class="date">15th September, 1781</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p>I return Dr Percy's letter of the 10th inst.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020275a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, on this disagreeable subject, of the recital of Erse poetry. I am sorry he has had so much trouble; but cannot blame myself, as I am satisfied the trouble did not originate with me. I have in what is past, and shall continue in what may follow, to confine myself strictly to what is necessary in my own defence. I found it alledged in print<span href="/item/fergadPC0020275a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, that Dr Percy had a cheat put upon him when at Edinburgh, to which I was accessory. In such cases it is often argued that until such or such assertions be contradicted they must be supposed true; and I did not choose that my character should rest upon that footing. I was free to deny any concurrence in the cheat, and even free to deny my having ever been present at any such scene as that in which the cheat was said to be practised. With respect to the last point, indeed, it may be thought that I could speak only negatively, and deny my having any memory of the transaction; and so it is no doubt of all past transactions. But there are circumstances which entitle a person to be more or less positive. In this case the cheat that is said to have been put upon Dr Percy could not be practised in my presence without my concurrence; and this every feeling of my mind warrants me in denying in the most positive terms. As I never questioned the fidelity of Mr James M'Pherson in his publications, I was none of those who busied themselves in finding evidence of it. It has happened to me, indeed, to mention a very few particulars of Erse poetry that were known to myself; and from my knowledge of which I had taken a very early impression of what mere genius, without the aid of literature or foreign models, may do where the human mind is free and the passions have scope in recital as well as in action. I imagined that evidence of its power might have been found in every country if collected before language and manners had so far changed as to obliterate or efface its productions. There being any remnants of it in the Highlands of Scotland, I imputed to the manners and language having changed less than they have done elsewhere in equal periods of time. Whether or no this be honourable for the people I will not at present try to determine. It appeared to me matter of some curiosity in the history of mankind, but very little as matter of vanity to one corner of this island, much less of jealousy to any other corner of it. The scraps I showed to Dr Percy had a reference to this idea, not the fidelity of Mr M'Pherson's publications. And I was surprised to find myself, contrary to the general tenor of my feelings, stated as a fabricator of evidence on that subject. I thought myself free to deny in very positive terms my having ever been present at the repetition of verses to Dr Percy by a student from the Highlands; because I never knew a student who pretended to repeat any part or specimen of Ossian's heroic poetry. And the mention of Mr John M'Pherson's name does not at all alter the state of my recollection, for my memory of him is, among other particulars in which he is well known to me, that he never appeared to be in possession of any part of Ossian's poetry. I well remember that he was in some degree a singer, though I do not recollect any particular song but one, which, with a very few words of any meaning, consisted chiefly of a chorus or burden, not more significant than lullabolaro or derry down. If he repeated this or any other song that Dr Percy might hear the sound of the language, it is no wonder that I should forget that circumstance, especially as I have totally forgot Dr Percy's visit with you at my house. But I hope that Dr Percy, now he has seen his minutes, will be sensible that a person may mistake what he thinks he remembers, as well as another may forget what has really passed. What he wrote from his memory in a former letter was, that I had sent for a student to your house<span href="/item/fergadPC0020275a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. What he writes now is, that he came to the student at my house. Some other very easy mistake in the circumstances, if recollected, might acquit me entirely of any share in the imposition that was put upon Dr Percy. I confess that I was astonished at the ease with which this charge was stated against me in the pamphlet which has given rise to this correspondence. If I had the honour of being sufficiently known to Dr Percy, I should certainly request that he would compare probabilities, and consider which is most likely, that I should be accessory to a cheat, or that he should mistake some material circumstance of a story sixteen years old. Although I may not be entitled to employ this plea with Dr Percy, I certainly must be allowed to submit it, in case I am under a necessity of more publications, to persons to whom I am better known. There is certainly hitherto no reason to apprehend from me, as Dr Percy mentions, any improper desire of committing my name in print. I appeared, from necessity, to prevent inferences which might be drawn from my silence against me. I do not pretend to set up my affirmation against that of any other person; but as often as occasion is given to the same inference, I must appear again to the same purpose. Dr Percy is pleased to say in the letter which I return to you, that if I persist in denying publicly the existence of a recital, &amp;c., he must then be compelled, much against his will, to produce at large necessary proofs in support of his own affirmation<span href="/item/fergadPC0020275a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. Dr Percy will be pleased to observe, that I do not pretend to know what recitals he may have had made to him. I only deny that I ever was present at any imposition put upon Dr Percy by any pretended recital of Erse, and that I ever was present at any such recital. I am persuaded that there are no proofs to the contrary, of which Dr Percy will not perceive the weakness the more he considers them. At any rate, he must be sensible that if any such proofs are supposed, I cannot possibly consent to have them secreted. When they appear, I hope that I too shall proceed with temper and decency, although I have a little more at stake than Dr Percy, and have my integrity to defend against a most unexpected attack, which it seems is to be carried on against me in support of his accuracy in conversation.</p><p class="signoff">I am, with much obligation for your good offices in this business, dear sir, your most affectionate humble servant, <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
