James Burnett of the Artillery who is since dead. A Missfortune which happened a few Months before Josephs Arrival &amp; probably exposes him to much disstress. I have procured &amp; sent him some recommendations in Bengale &amp; I know that if you have any means of aiding us there you will not neglect it. I have passed last year mostly in France &amp; Swisserland &amp; Received your last letter at Geneva.</p><p>Lord Chesterfields Affairs have required his presence for a little in england &amp; we have been out three months at London &amp; are at last come to Blackheath for the remainder of our Stay in this Countrey. We have [xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> about eighteen Months to spend abroad, At the Expiration of which I expect to returne to my usual Affairs at Edinburgh. I have keept my Professorship one year by a Deputy<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> &amp; mak[e] application to have the same Indulgence prolonged for another. My Wife &amp; Children of who[m] I have four keep house with their Uncle Doctor Black. So much for my own Affairs, And <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> yet there is still something more. Charles Greville has payd me Since I have been here One hundred Pounds on your Account. I do not know if your Old Acquaintance the farm of Bankhead<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> deserves to have so much Additional expence laid out upon it but if I live to see or to Inhabit that undutiful place I shall make it carry some mark of your Friendship which is a better fruit than it Commonly bears. Lord Warwick and his Brothers are in the Midwifes Phrase doing as well as coud be expected. Charles is in the board of Trade &amp; if he were not carryed away by Virtü woud make a Statesman &amp; I hope in spite of Virtü will do So. He applys to Bussiness &amp; has been Speaking in the house of Commons. I never cease to Goad him on that Road. Robert has at least got the Rank of Captain in his Majestys Guards. He has Penetration attended with [xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Very pleasant humour &amp; has in reality better Conduct than either of his Brothers. Your Friend James M<sup>c</sup>Pherson has Published his History in two Vols. 4to &amp; his State Papers in [t]wo Vols more<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. I am told he has Sold greatly and [g]iven great Offence to Familys &amp; State Partys. You know how little he is dissposed to Palliate [t]he vices or follys of Mankind &amp; how little likely [to] please those who consider their own Party <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> or their <ins>own</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> Ancestors as Heroes. I am apt enough to believe that he has carryed the humour of depreciating too far &amp; from this way of expression you will learn that I have not yet Read enough to form a decisive Judgement. The Dissipation of London is inconsistent with any reading but news Papers. I have brought the Book hither last night &amp; will be through it soon. As far as I have seen; The Characters he draws and other Prominent Passages are very Masterly. The General Course of the Narration Inferior.</p><p>John Home has been at London some weeks has in <ins>his</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> hands some Dramatic Works for the Stage but not for this Winter. The Adams as you will have heard have by Means of their Lottery &amp; great Good Fortune escaped from a Storm &amp; are again in Prosperity. The Nephew<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> a young man in whom I have always perceived much goo[d] Sense &amp; excellent disspositions; having come into Parliament at a great expence, which was much Censured; has shown himself well qualif[ied] for that Station &amp; <ins>has</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> well Justified the Conduct of his Friends in bringing him Forward. Adam Smith tells me he is just finishing his long expected work on National Resources and the Policy of Trade<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>. And now My Dear S<sup>r</sup> for the Pen of Angels if I had it to tell you of the Critical State of this Nation, And <span class="folio">[folio 2 verso]</span> the wonderfull events that are in Suspence. The Americans have destroyed much of your Company Tea. Government here got Angry &amp; made Acts to Chastise them. They have accumulated their Insolence And Government their Acts. They are Arming a[nd] we are Arming, each I believe hopes to bully the Other but Bullys have sometimes drawn themselves into a Serious quarrel and so may we<sup>m</sup> The consequences look so tremendous to m[e]. And are so slightly Treated by the Retainers of Government here that I am apt to think myself in a Misstake about them altho I wait at least with a very high degree of Curiosity [f]or the Ishue. I am affraid that we never sha[ll] have genius enough to turn the great resources [w]hich are presented to us in The East or the [W]est to Account. I have heard of your intention [to] returne to Europe &amp; likewise of the Probability that Lord Pigots<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> appointment &amp; Arrival at [M]adrass will detain you in India. In that I wish [y]ou to do what is best but cannot help re[co]mmending to you to Collect the fullest detail [y]ou can of every circumstance relating to the [s]tate &amp; operation of Policy in India &amp; so equipped [to] be ready to present yourself here by the time India Affairs come again under the Review of Gov[ernm]ent, which cannot, by the term of the Charter, be [xxx]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> far off. This Letter goes by My <span class="folio">[folio 3 recto]</span> Friend Captain Thomson a young Man of great worth to whom I earnestly wish your Friendship. I have likewise a Friend and Namesake<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> at Bengale whose Adventures, by the loss of a worthy Brother murdered at the Cape of Good Hope, have been more Tragic than those of my Brother in Law Jos. Burnett. If you can [<del>xxx</del> <del>xxx</del>]<span href="/item/fergadPC0010119a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> by your Correspondence there make him feel any Effects of your Friendship to me I shall be greatly Obliged if any thing can Add to the sense of Honour and of pleasure which your Affection gives me. That you may the better apprehend what I mean by the detail I have mentioned on the last page. Select some Town &amp; its Disstrict. Procure if possible an account of its extent &amp; numbers of People. The different class's of that People the occupations the resources the way of Life of each. How they are related &amp; their mutual dependencys. What Contributions Government or Subordinate Masters draw from the Labourer of any Denomination &amp; how it is drawn &amp;c. But I beg Pardon for saying so much of an Object which you must know so much better than I do. The man who can bring light from India into this Countrey <span class="folio">[folio 3 verso]</span> And who has address to make his light be followed may in a few years hence make himself of great Consequence. And here I shall conclude my Letter. Be so Good as direct for me to the Care of Mr Robert Mayne Banker in Jermyn Street London. I am</p><p class="signoff">My Dear Sir <br />your most Affectionate &amp; most <br />humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
