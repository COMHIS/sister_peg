INTR:OD UCTION,

SEC-TION T.

Of Knowledge in general. *
A L L knowledge is either of

particular fads, or of ge-
neral rules.

The knowledge of fats is prior

to that of rules; andis the first re-
quifite in the praaice of arts, and
in the condu.c of affairs.

* Bacon's Novum organum.

A A

A general rule is the cxprelTion

of vwhat is conlmon, or is requi-
red to be common, in a number
of particular cafes,

General rules are the result of

observation, or wilf; and confe-
quently are derived from mind.

Practice, or conduc of any fort,

though regulated by general rules,
has a continual reference to parti-
culars.

In speculation, we endeavour to
eRtabllih general rules.

In praAice, we study particu-

lar cafes, or apply general rules
to regulate our conduct.

S E:C'T:- In.

Of Scielce.

Colledion of facts, in de-
scription or narration, con-
ftitutes history.

General

General rulei, and their appli-

cations, to re-giate or to explain
particulars, constitute science.

Any general rule colicted from
facts, is termed ,' lai of inatre.

A general ruler when applied to

explain or regulate particulars, is
termed a prizncple; and explana-
tion from principle is termed the-
voy. The particulars to be ex-
plained are termed phenomenla.

Method in' fcicnce is of two
kinds;. analytic, and fyntletic.

Analytic method is that by

which we proceed from obferva-
tion of faa, to eftablifih general
rules.

Synthetic method, is that by

which we proceed from general
rules to their particular applica-
tions.

The first is the method of inve-
fligation.

A The

The second of communication,
or of the enlargement of science.

Argument is of two kinds:
A priore, and a poertiore.
By an argurient a nriore, the
faci is proved from the law.

By an argument a poJteriore, the
law is proved from the' fad

*' . I P.T. lI...:
''T H E, laws of nature are ei-

ther physical, aQ lupral

A physical law is ay general

expyrefUqn of a natural operation,
as exemplified in a number of par-
ticular cafes.

In every operation, men arre b)

nature cdifppfed t .appreliend an
operatingrpower or cause.

Caufci-

Causes are of two kinds:
Efficient, and final.
The efficient cause, is the ener-
gy or power producing an effedt.

The final cauCe, is the end or

puriofe for vlir i .n effel is pro.
tduccd. '

In fuppcing final caifes, we
fiupofc the cxiflence of mind.

Physical laws refer only to effi-

cient causes; such therefore are
the immin iate obJe4As of science.

A moral law is any general ex-

pression of what is good; and
therefore fit to determine the
choice of intelligent beings.

A phyfica1 law'dctfts so far only
as it is the facd.-

A moral law exifls in being ob-
ligatory.

The fuljcct from whiich phyfi-

cal laws are colleded, may be
classed under four principal h eatds;

A .
' M'-.-lh iii,

Mechanism, vegetation, animal
life, and intelligence.

It has not hitherto been made

appear, although sometimes at-
tempted, that the operations of a-
ny of these different natures arc
comprehended under the fame
laws to which the others are sub-
i eted.

The phenomena of vegetation

are not compreheinded under any
knownC'law of miechanifnl; much
less animal life or intelligence.

The fubjecds from which moral

laws tre colleeRed, are the fcnti-
rnents and at:ions of intelligent
nat-nres. ''
'

The immediate use of physical
lav;s, is theory.

The immediate use of moral
laws, is moral philosophy.

SECT.

S E C T. IV.

Of Tlheory.
'rficory conhifts in referring

particular operatioQis to the

principles, or general laws, under
which they are c nprqhe;nded; or
il, refrÂ»trig ,ar.tieular ; f[els to
the .4aufeo -f4rm, y i), tJy pro-
ceed.

To point out any general rule

,or law of nature previously
know!l. i -which any particular
fa& is comprehended, is to ac-
count fvr that faa.

Thus Sir Isaac Newton ac-

counted for the planetary revolu-
tions, by showing that they were
comprehended in t'c laws of mo-
tion and gravitation.

To pretend to explain pheno-

mena,

mena, by fllowing that they may
be comprehended in any fuppofi-
tion, or by applying to them,
metaphorically, the. language
which is deyivedi fromny other
fubjet,.-Ais.itlHury.in Â£cq.nce.

Thus the. vortex of Descartes,

being a mere fippofitiol, made
no true explanation of the plane-
tar) system; : aid the, terms, ilNa,
image, or ?tlUrc, of' ttiigs, being
terms r'cel.y p etaphoril, can-
not explain human knowledge or
thoughlt.

All phenomena not comipre-

fieded( under a.ly kncwn law, arc
the proper ,materials. of natural hi-
Itorv.

All facds that cannct be explain-

cd by any rule previoullv known,
or better known than the fads
tihemfelves, may be termed ulti-
'wate Jcs.

It

It is evident, that all theory
muff reft on ultimate fads.

To require proof a priore for

every fad, were to suppose, that
human knowledge requires an in-
finite ftries of fads and- explanai
tions; which is irnpoffible.

Of Mra P ifpj,. '... ..
M Oral philosophy is the know-

' 1.

ledge of what ought to be,

or the application obf' fles that
ought to- deteritie the choke-6s
voluntary agents.

Before we can ascertain rules of

morality fitted to any particular
nature, the ia relating to that
nature fiould be known.

Before we can ascertain rules of
norality for mankind, the hifto-

ry of man's nature, his diflofi-
tions, his specific enjoyments and
fufTerings, his condition and fu-
ture profpecds, ihould be known.

story of mind, .is die founda.tion
of moral ploiQf9phy.

&E G, T. 'Vi:

Of Ptw atics.
P Neumatic treat physically of

mind or spirit.

This science consists of two
parts.

The first treats of man; the fe-
cond, of God.

Tlhat part which treats of man,

,;n'I1 contain the hitfory of man's
.:lt:;re, and an explanation or
tlecorr of tlic principal phlenome-
na of Ih:m:n life.

Tllat

That which treats of God, con-

tains the proofs of his existence,
attributes, and government.

The history of man contains

either filch salts as occur on a ge-
neral view of the species;, r fich as
occur to the individual, in recol-
lecting what passes in his own
miind.

The first may be teried, the

]ijory of the species; the second,
that of the indivtidiiti.

In the theory of human nature

are solved questions relating `tq
the characers of men, to the nas
ture and future prospects of the
human foul. '

lVarieties of the hswmIanl race.
UT Nder the general form and

aspet of mankind, there

are considerable varieties of the
race.

Men being diicerfed over the

face of the earth, receive the in-
fluences of climate, situation, and
toil.

The animal and rational tem-

perament, is comlparatively phleg-
matic and dull in cold climates;
is more ardent and quick in warm
climates; but has always pollif-
fed a diftinguifiled superiority in
the temperate.

sifts of'between seventy and a hun-

It appears from the annual re-

gifler of deaths where the num-

That oftwenty-feven or twenty-

That about a fourth of the

DiJvpftim; of man to ficicty *
A Nimals have been (liftinguifl-

ed into two claflcs; the ioli-
tars, and the social.

Animals of prey, for the most
part, are solitary.

Other animals are, for the mofl
part, alIcciating.

The associating may be farther
fubditidled into two kinds:

i. Those vwhich aflcmble in

flocks or herds, merely for com-
panm or safety:

2. Those who unite their la-
bours for some commnon purpose.

and distribute the burdens of the
community according to some
rule of instinc't or of reason.

The latter are aflociating and

political. Man, though an ani-
!nal of prey, and from ncceffity
or iirt addictcd to hunting or
war, is nevertheless, in the high-
elt degree, associating and politi-
cal.

The species is every where

found in troops, companies, and
fraternities, or in national confe-
deracies.

They afrociate in certain num-
bers from affetion and choice.

In greater numbers, the) arc

assembled by neccfity, or the au-
tliority of leadcrs.

They make peace or war from

comlmonl interefis, or common a-
nimofie0ti .

If tlhc wars li'll)i2ing between
iu!arate comrnliuiucs, be a proof

o0'

of eflrangcnlcnt and lhoiiliry, the
peace and union fubfifilin in each
community apart, is a proof of at-
tachmcnt aind amlity.

Men accommod(ate the form of

their focictv to the number and
disposition of their mcrtbers, to
their situation and pursuits.

By their confederacy, as well as

by their artifice, they are enabled
to subdue every other fpecics of a-
nimal, to subsist by their spoil,
and to employ the strength of o-
ther animals, though superior to
their own.

Separate societies are, for the
most part, rivals or enemies *.

tio:s of fin-all colmlmilities, great

to the time that elapses in pregnan.

to the numbers of each brood; and
to the period during which the pa-
rent continues prolific.

The laws of propagation deter-

mine the numbers that may spring
from any single pair, and the
numbers of generations that may
subsist together.

These laws, in every species of

animals, are, in favourable cir-
cumftances, sufficient to its in-
crease.

Men, in every secure situation,

people up to their resources; and
the aid of government is required,
not to improve on the laws of
propagation, but to bestow fecuri-
ty and plenty.

Animals of prey have most dif-

The desire

d of retreats has given
rife to the art of fortification.'

The art of war, in every 'age,
must be accommodated to the fipe-

G 2 . cl-

cies of arms, engines, and me-
thods of fortification, in use.

Thie arts which men practi. e

rfr f-bfibeence, are, fimhing, hu.nt-
ing, pasturage, and agriculture.

/adtions that know le;.i of tile

means of fubfifLence, Iive re-
course to hunting and filing; or
rely on the spontaneous growtli of
the neld in herbs or fruit.

In the result of these' atis, the
untilig-ground, the lake, the ri-
ver, or the bay, may be appro-
priated to the fociery; but the
game is seldom appropriated to
the individual.

Nations that have observed the

method, and the advantage, of
breeding herds, betake theimfelves
to paLfurage.

They at frft, generally, migrate,
or wander, with their herds.

Nations that are acquainted

with the use of herbs, fruits, and
grain, whi'ch. do not- grow fpd6n-

to agriculture..

The culture of land, to a cer-

tain degree, is comiatible wlit

ancient nations of Germanv ,
and among some modern nations
of NoIoth America.

As the property of land excites

to invention in agriculture, itlike-
wife excites to invention in other
arts.

They whhoha-ve no land betake

themselves to manufadture, that
they may have wherewith to buy
the produce of land.

By manufaadure, men are fur-

nifled with the means of accom-
modation and ornament. -'

The means of accommodation

are, cloaths, houses, furniture,
utenils, equipage.

Men, in different ages, are un-

equally furniihed with these dif-
ferent articles; they are even
found to fLibfift without them;
but, in the ruder climates, under
such inconveniences, as diminifli
the numbers of the species, or pre-
vent their incteafe.

The means of decoration are
such things as pleafc the fancy,

without

without being necessary or useful.

Men, in all ages, are fond of

decoration; they combine orna-
ment with the means of subsist-
ence: and- accommodation,:.. but
they may subsist, and enjoy:every
conveniency, without regard to.
ornament. . .:

Ornaments are principally made

of rare materi-as ;.;as gems, pre-
cious metals,, &. .
.

Riches Gonfift in the abundance

of things that conduce to safety,
fuibfi-ence, accommodation, and
ornament.

Riches are the. result of arts and
industry . :

Whatever ingenuity men exert

in the praaice'of arts, their fuc-
cess will depend on- a proper dif-
tribution of their employments,
and on their making afeparate bu-
finess of each. !

a single person, or to a single assem-

In mixed inffitutions, the fu-

preme authority is exercised by a
plurality of collateral powers.

Simple institutions. are, demo-

cracy, ariftocraey, monarchy, and
lefpotifm.

Democracy is the supreme
power of the collecive body.

This institution is calculated to

corred-, or 1o remove, the. effects
of adventitious dependency and
filbordination, and to reconcile e-
quality with order.

Arillocracy is the supreme

power of a particular rank or class
of men.

This class of men has, in some

cafes, been elective; in others, he-
reditary.

The infiitution itself, though cal-
culated to confirm the ilperiority
of one rank, and the dcpcndence

of

of the other, may, notwithftand-
ing, preserve equality among the
members of each class.

Monarchy is the fipreme power

of a single person, who; placed at the
head of many subordinate digni-
ties, has an authority defined by
laws.

This inititution is calculated to

confirm adventitious dependency
and fiubordination.

Extensive arid perpetual milita-

ry arrangements have led to mo-
narchical subordination.

Defpotifin is the supreme power

of a single person, assumed and
maintained by force, on the ruin
of every other pretension to rank.

Defpotifin has arisen from con-

Such are, tones of the voice,

Conventional signs are such as

men have agreed upon, or ren-

Conventional signs may be ran-
ged under the three following heads.

i. Mutefigns.
. Speech.
3. Written charaÃ³ers.
Where men are forbid the use

of speech, or are defective in the
organs of hearing, or of pronun-
ciation, they have recourse to
mute signs and attain, in a con-
fiderable degree, the purposes of
language.

Nations employ unequal mea-

fures of action, and of mute signs,
together with speech.

Speech is universal to mankind,
and peculiar to the human fpecics.

Every separate nation, or tribe,

for the most part, has had a fepa-

The theory of speech,. whether

universal or particular, is the fci-

of words, or of articulate founds.

They are either verbal, or alpha-

Animal Sefie and Perception. *
SEnsation is obtained by means

of corporeal organs; and is,

for the moit part, attended by an
original or acquired perception
of tome exte.nal: cwfe, or object
of the perception..,,,

The organs of sense are corn

monly reduced to five heads:
Touch, Taste, Smell, Hearing,
and Seeing.

T o u c H.

some degree an organ of touch.

ing.

ing, are either pleasant, painful,
or indifferent.

The interior 'or subcutaneous

parts, are sensible only to the pains
which arise from hurts or diibr-
ders.

The final cause appears to be,
that in their ordinary and found
late, they should require no at-
tcnrion ; but in cafe of disorders,
that they should give the alarm.

On the exterior surface of the

body, harmless sensations are in-
different, but whatever hurts is
painful.

Indifferent sensations are the

indications of the mere contad of
innocent bodies.

Painful sensations are indica-
tions of hurts or wounds.

Pleasant fecnf!tions are the sign

of relief from lwhat hurts or
wounds; as of moderate warmth

E 2 succeeding

fuccceding to great cold, or the
co vcrfie.

MIany indifferent sensations, in

particular parts of the body, as in
the hands, the tonlgu, &c. are
indications' of the 'i'tllmate pro-
perties, and nice difitilnions, of
bodies; as of thlir figure, polifli,
hardness, softness, as wellas com-
parativc heat or cold.

Tie perceptions of this sense

are, in bome inflancesj original;
in others, acquired.

The figure, hardness, softness,

heat, and cold, of bodies, are
matter of original perception.

Many of their salutary or per-

nicious qualities are learned by
experience, and are matter of ac-
quired perception.

We sometimes perceive the na-

ture, as well as the exitfence, ot
qualities; as of figure, hardness,
softness.

In

In others, we perceive the exist-

'cnce of the quality, but not its
nature; as of heat and cold.

The firit have been termed pri-

mary, the other, secondary, quali-
ties of bodies.

The sensations by means of
rwhich we perceive primary quali-
ties, are, for the most part, indif-
ferent, and have no name.

The sensations by which we

perceive secondary qualities, are,
for the most part, either pleasant
or painful; are confidered apart
from the perception they bring;
and frequently usurp the name of
the quality perceived, so as to oc-
cation a considerable ambiguity in
language. Thus heat or cold,
which are the names of certain
unknown properties in bodies, are
sometimes understood of animal
sensation or fccling.

E 3 The

The animal sensation can, in

no cafe, have any resemblance :to
the subjeA or quality perceived.

Its informations, therefore, are

not like that we receive"from.. the
inspection of a piture .or .image;
but like that we receive lby means
of language,, or other arbitrary
signs... :
.

In original perception, the sign

is affixed by nature, and the inter-
pretation inftintive,, :- -.:

Our sensations are not fitted to

furnish us with the. means of in-
vefligation, and of proof, but.with
perceptions. which precede all in-
veftigation or proof., . , .

S M E L L.

The organ of finell is placed

within the nostrils, near to the
passage of the air in respiration.

There is a greater analogy be-

tween the sensations of smell and
taste, than between those of any
other two of our senses.

They agree in giving a percep-

tion of Iecondary qualities; in
enabling us, by the help of expe-
rience, to diflinguifh external
subjects, and to recognise the fame
subject frequently, whilst the qua-
lity of the sensation varies from

pleasant

plcafaint to painful or indiffe-
rent.

HE A R I N G.

The organ of hearing is placed
in the interior part of the ear.

The sensations of found, whe-

ther tingle, or multiplied, and va-
riouly combined, are either plea-
sant, painful, or indifferent.

The quali'y ;perceived is fecon-

dary, fdoind, by mnveftgation, to
be puiles of the air, occasioned by
explosions, or by 'he tremors of
tense and elastic' matter of any
fort. '

Sounds are diverfifed by their
intensity and'mnufical tone.

Tones being a natural language

of icntiment, arc, by certain com-
binations, easily rendered pathe-
tic.

Different

Different founds are, by expe.

rience, learned to be the signs or
indications of different subjects,
and of different movements.

S t G I T.

The organ of fight is placed in
the eye.

Its sensations are sometimes plea-

sant or.painful, but for the most
part indifferent; and therefore o-
verlooked.

Of the qualities perceived by

means of these sensations, some
are primary, others secondary.

The original perception obtain-

ed by fight, is that of the vi-
fible appearance of things exter-
nal. This appearance includes
superficial extension and figure,
apparent magnitude, illumination,
fliade, and colour.

The

The acquired perception is that

of the real dimensions, figures,
and distances of bodies.

In the use of this organ, there

tion in the eye that is extremely

Of At iragion.
A Blration is the flating of cer-

tain qualities and circum-

stances apart from other qualities
and circumstances to which they
arc adcually joincd il nature.

Thus a quality is ftatzd apa:;

from its ftlbjeCt, or an operatio;!
is fiated apart front the operator,
and becomes an abstract.

A few qualities in which ma-
,-y fiiebets agree, are flated apart

from

from the qualities that diftinrguifil
thlofe fubjets ; and fich abftrac-
tions are expreffd in generic
natmes.

By different abftliraCons, the

general caflcs or predicamcnts to
which objects may be referred,
arc variously conceived.

Abatraction is the reverse of i-

i;lmaination: it is the foundation
of gencral and comprhenfeive rea-
lbning, not of description or praf-
sion.

Men are fomcrimes the dupcs
of their own abftraaions, and
confider those things as Ifparatc
in nature which are.ouly I:parate

## SECT. VIII. Of Reasoning.

S E C T. VIII.

Of RcafoSnig.
R Fafoning consists of invefti-

g:;rion, arrangcment, and
argumcnt.

In-vctigation is the discovery of

general rules, or of laws, from
particular and various instances.

Investigation is the foundation
of theory.

Arrangement is the classing of

(,bjccls together according to
'O!ne relation they have in nature.

Relations are those of similitude,
'ontiguity, cause, and effeSl.

Similitude and contiguity fur-

nilh the arrangement of natural
iliftorv:

'The relation of cause and es-

sect,

fc2, the arrangement of science
or theory.

The laws of nature, which de-

scribe, in the most general terms,
the operations of exilling caufcs,
comprehend, by a relation of si-
militude, the phenomena which
are the cffects, or particular opera-,
tions, of those caufcs.

Argument is the use of rcafon
to produce conviction.

Argument is taken, either apri-
cIe, or a Itrcore.

Argument a priorc, proves or
(lifproves the fad from the law,
or the effei from the cause.

Every argument of this fort
n,iy be reduced to a perfect fil-
loifin, confifiing of three pro-
politions: of whl'ich one announ-
ces the law, either negative or po-
fliive; another compares the law
with the fad to be proved; and
the third affirms or denies the

or oppolition to the law.

Argument a pojierire, proves or

diiproves the rule, from the enu-
meration of particulars.

Every Iuch argument may b'

reldced to a fllogilin, conltitinl
ot two propoitions: one is induc-
ion or enumeration of facts; the
other affirms or denies the law,
from the concurrence, or want ot
cmncurrence, il the particular-
brought to efiabliih it.

those circumfiances.

'Penctration and sagacity are the

foundations of good conduct, art,
,iu(l idll.

SEC T. X.

Of Propetfity.
M E N, like the other animals,

are active, from original
choice, and propcntity.

They delight in freedom and

cxcrcife; they pine under rctraint,
or in the absence of objects fit to
excite them.

The acdivity of man's nature

confifls in propensity, sentiment,
desire, and volition.

Propcnfitics

Propensities have their effect

prior to the expericnce of pleafurc
or pain.

Thev are either animal or ra-
tional.

The animal propensities are the

appetites to food, sleep, and the
propagation of the fpecics.

Thciie appetites are periodical or

occasional, and are intertnittcd
when their ends are obtained.

The rational prbpenfities are,

the care of felf-prefcrvation, the
aitections of parent and child, the
affecaions of the sexes, the ifllc-
tion to society, and the defirc to
excel.

Tliefe, like animal appetites,
'i.-c a direc.ion to human nature
prior to any experience of their
gratificacions.

But, contrary to the analo-v ot

animala appetites and gratifications,
tiev n ay continue to occupy ha-

bitua!!y,

bitually, without faticty or dif-
gult.

All affections of kindness are,
in their owvn nature, pleasant.

Having thele natural propcnfi-

tics, we state objects under the
prc(licaments of good or of evil as
they arc supposed conducive or
opposite to the purpofcs of our
propenlties.

Whatever is thought. conducive
to preservation, is reckoned good.

Whatever is thought perni-
cious, is reckoned evil.

Whatever promotes the welfare

of society, or of any object belo-
ved, is therefore fuippofed good.

What is pernicious, is fulppofed
evil.

Whatever is thought in itself to

constitute a perfection, or to give
eminence, is supposed good.

Whatever is thought to confli-
tute imperfection, or to fink our

Hence the great influence of o-

pinion on the external pursuits of

S E C T. XI.

Of Secntilment *.

-Entiment is a state of 'minid re-
3 lative to what is thought to be
good or evil.

Sentiments are pleasant or pain-
ful.

The sentiment arifiig from a

supposed good attained; is plea-
sant; from a supposed good mif-
fed or forfeited, is painful.

A supposed evil avoided, is plea-
sant; incurred, is painful.

?* See Theory of agreeable sentiments

The

The, pleasure in both tliefe ca-
fes is termed Jor.

The pain is termed Sorrow, or

Grief.

'A supposed good in expeaa-
tion of being gained, is pleasant;
in expectation of being loft, is
painful. ,

The pleaflare in either of these
two cafes is termed Hope.

The pain is termed Fear.
Thus all our feintiments, or-paf-

sions, may be referred to -fÂ£ir
general heads:

Joy, Grief, Hope, and Fear.
But there is a great variety in

the sentiments of joy and grief,
of hope and fear, corresponding
to the nature of the supposed good
or evil, and-ofthe propensity by
which we are direded towards it.

The sentiments of those who

are occupied chiefly in their own
preferrvation, -are, the *sense offfafe--

G ty

ty and ihccefs, or of danger and
dliltppoillmenlt.

The first may comprehend fecn.
itv, exultation, and insolence;
the second, jealoufvi, terror, and
derfair.

The most painful fentimcnts of

those who are occupied chiefly by
their regard to mankind, are allc-
i lated by the pleaftlres of affic-
rtn. confidence, and good will.

The sentiments of those who are

occupied chiefly with the confidc-
ratlin of excellencies or defeds in
tliemielves, or il others, are, on
the one hand, respecting them-
i-Ives, and their ownI abfolutc
perfcioins or defets, felt-appro-
bation, and elevation of mind; on
the other hand, fliaine, rcmorfe,
and dejection.

In refped to comparative ad-

vantages, and fiuperiority to other
m-ien, their sentiments are, Cxulta-

tio;i,

tioiI, vain-glory, insolence, and
contempt.

The sentiments of men reflecl-
ing real excellencies in others, arc,
eftecm, relifpet, and veneration.

I.cllem is a fcntimcnt of appro-
bn:ion tending to confidence.

'i'l"e ^ti ns-of men rcfptct-

ing deec't' a!e, Cosltempt, ridi-
cule, indignation, a!nd rage.

Contempt is a sentiment of dif-

approbation, tending to indift'-
rence bti neg}ed.

Ridicule is a sentiment of dif-
approbation, mixed with mirth
or pleasantry.

Men of wit sometimes render

the subjec3 of which they treat
ridiculous.

Buffoons render themselves so.

G As

As the sentiment of (disapproba-

tio;n predominates, 'idicule ap-
proaches to scorn.

As the sentiment of pleasantry

predominates, it approaches to
mirth, and may eve'n be mixed
withi tendernelf.

The scornful are rarely fufcept-
ible of admiration or love.

I ndoiation is a Ilniti-mcntof dil

ap probation, mixedc with refcLt-
mn'ielt.

Rage is a sentiment of difappro-
bation, mixed with hatred.

The sentiments of men refped-

ing comparative advantages;in o-
thers, differ according to thl.ftate
of their affections, and according
as they state a comparison with
themselves, or with other men.

The iuperiority of those thcv

S E C T. XII.

Deire aud Avefion.
D Eftire and aversion arise from

opinion, founded in cxpe-
rience or fancy.

Mens desires and aversions arc
various as their opinions.

The most common examples of

fettled or habitual desire, are, fen-
fuality, avarice, alnmbition, pu-
blic spirit, elevtiolo of nmilJ, or

G 3 lth

the desire of excellency and per-
section.

These desires have a foundation

in some natural propensity, and
lead to the objects which, in our
opinion, tend to fulfil the pur-
pole of our original propensities.

Scnfuality is founded in animal

appetites i and ariles fiom an opi-
nion, or expedation, of good, in
t}c means of their gratifications,

Avarice is founded in the care

of self- preservation; and aims at
Pecurity, by amassing and hoard-
ing the means of subsistence.

Ambition is the desire to com-

mand; and arises from an opinion,
that to have rank or power over
other men, is to excel.

Ptblic spirit is founded in be-

nevolence: its object is indefinite,
men, or intelligent natures, where-
ever they present themselves to our
view or conception.

Elevation

## SECT. XIII. Of Volition.

Elevation of mind is founded
in the love of perfecions, and in
the aversion to defeAs.

S E C T. xIII.

Of Volition.
VOlition is the ac' of will in

free determinations.

The determination is free
where-ever it is voluntary.

The motives from which we

chute, do not destroy our free-
dom ; for to acd from motives not
forced upon us, to be willing, vo-
luntary, and free, in any adtion,
arc synonymous terms.

The term law is ambiguous.

In this sense it--is,.employed by
natural philosophers t.

In this itnfenfe chiefly:. tle mate-

laws.

must be ftriEtly observed; because
it is law only so far as it is obfer-

whatever relates to mind, is said
to be moral. .;.

I T r'E'tiiftloiY'"f 'th' nder-

I principal rules, or physical laws.

The first relates 'to the percep-

tion obtained' of 'what exists be-
yrondl.ourelves.

The 'second, to the comprehen-
sion of rubjets perceived.

FIRST LAW.

Perception is obtained by the
intervention of media,. no way re-

H Efembling

fembling the subjea of such per-
ception:

I. The medium of sensation.
2. The'mediumn ofifigns.
Most theories of the human un-

derftanding proceed on a fuppo-
ition, that all information is re-
ceived in a manner analagous .to
the representations given by means
of images or pictures.

Wre are so accustomed to: meta-

phor: or allegory of this .fort,' that
we think it demonftrable.a priore,
that there must be: images, types,
or resemblances, of external sub-
jets, in the brain,, or in the mind,
-from which.the mind receives in-
formation -of :the originals, and
in comparing which its reasoning
concerning the originals conffits.

But :when we compare the

knowledge of any subjea with
the picture of a .fubjeet, we must
be satisfied, that the whole Ian-

guage

guage transferred from one to the
other is merely metaphorical.

Syflems founded in metaphor,

are commonly mere allegories, by
which we are made to mifflae: the
interpr'etatiorl of .the allegory for
an acceflion of science.:

The feniation;,,by ;means !of

which we naturally -perceive the
exiflence of external: subje6s, 1 has
no refemblanee to: those fubje6its

Thea'igns bywhicl--we natural-

ly perceive'the:exiftence andmreain-
ing of other minds, have no,re-
semblance to the things signified.

Yet we cannot-refrain our per-

ception in. the. ;one .cafe, nor -our
interpretation, in the'other.

The general law of information
then has two branches':

That which relates to the per-
ception of material fubjeds: .

And that wlich relates to.. de

.H 2 ..inter-

interpretation of meaning and
thought.

SECOND LAW.

To comprehend any particular

subje't, is to know some general
predicament or class to which it
may be referred. -

Thus to comprehend the nature

of any particular being or quali-
ty, is to:be able to refer it to some
known species or class.

To comprehend any operation

or phenomenon, is to be able to
refer it to fame eftabliflied rule, or
known law of nature.

Thus we comprehend all the

phenomena that can be referred
to the laws of gravitation, cohe-
sion, elecricity, and so forth.

To make a new discovery, is
either to investigate some law, or

to

to point out some new applica-
tion.

Thus Sir Isaac Newton disco-

vered the law of' refration, and
applied &it to, the.rainb:ow, and- to
the colours,-of.natratl bodies.,,.

Dr Franklin applied, the laws .of

eledricity to lightning,. a .nd .to

rvHE history of the human
T will may furnish the three
following general rules.

F: IR'ST L AW.

Men naturally desire whatever
they think is useful to themselves.

Under this title they desire the

means. of: subsistence,:; ,health,
firength, beauty, parts, -temper,
resolution, &c.

This

This is commonly termed the

law of felf-prefervation:, but-Tfo
great is the variety of mens opi-
nions,; and; fich.the' capiice6 of
their ipaflions, tiat ia they7':appar
in some- cafes .to desire wliat -id-
firucdive.

S E';C ON D-' LA-W.

Men iaatiirally l .edefirethe wel-
fare of their fellow-creatures.

General calamities are matter

of regret; general welfare, is mat-
ter of joy. . :

This may be termed the law of

society; and is -that which quali-
fies tle individual to be a member
offociety, inclines .him to: con-
tribute to the general good, and
intitles him to partake in it. .,_i :

Thei reality of this law has been
disputed: . .- : ;

I. Because

i. Becaue: men do -not general-
ly adc for. public good.

: 2. Because what ,they- do of this
kind, may-.heaccounted for from
othi-inmotd.ses. :. : :,i:.... - i.

The;-aions-.of men; are regula-

ted, not by- this law-only,- buit by
this combined -with ev-ery other
law of their nature::. . .:

If ie'law :of felf-prefervation,

so6 the 'ij--,tj pirevail, it does
not follow, that the' law-of.;fociety
has no efft&. - ' : 't."

The external efeet,: or tenden cy

of'every law, -is-diverfified in dif-
ferent cireumiftnciess,~: :-.: t,,' .

The general tendency ;of the:

law of- gravitation is, to cause bo-
dies to approach to each other;
as the tendency of the law of so-
ciety is, to cause meii-o: produce
public good, or'to 'abstain :from
public harm.: -
. :-;

But

But the external result is oppo-
site in opposite circumstances.

Heavy bodies are not always
falling, nor social natures always
ading for the common-good.

When bodies are falling, gravi-
tation accelerates; when thley are
placed on a fupport.at reft,;it cau-
fes a pressure:; whenl ,they are
thrown upwards, it can only re,-,
tard; when they are moved ob-
liquely, it turns their- motion inta
a curve path;: &c;

The analogy of this law may
fully illustrate the law of society.

This law, in some cafes, ex-
cites to beneficence,; in other ca-,
fes, only. retards mischief. It
increases our ardour in actions be-
neficial to our fellow-creatures; it
restrains or diminishes our ardour
in adions hurtful: it gives satis-
facion in one cafe, and remorse
in another. And thus the opera-

tion.

tion of the law of society, like that
of gravitation itself, is always real,
though the external result is not
always the fame.

As to the motives from which

men ac' for the good of their fel-
low-creatures, those may be va-
rious in various inflances; but no
person can know, except in his
own cafe, that there'are no sincere
affec&ions ' of benevolence and
good-will. - :

THIRD LAW.

Men naturally desire what con-

flitutes excellence, and avoid
what constitutes defect.

Different objects have their dif-

tinguilfing qualities, and become,
in the view of different animals,
objeds ofdefire or aversion: but
in the view of man, they are like-

-wife.

wife, in many cafes, objecs of e-
fieem or contempt.

This is an ultimate fadt in the
nature of man, and not to be ex-
plained by any. thing that ispre-
vioufly. or better , knowvn., :

Excellency, w whether .absolute
or comparative, is ..the supreme
objee of human desire...

Riches, power,:_ and even plea-

sure, are:. coveted with .extreme
ardour only when they :are -sup-
posed to bestow eminence or
rank.

SECT. I.

Of Interest.

TNtereft is the concern men take
I in things supposed useful or
necessary to the purposes of ani-
mal life.

Things useful to animal life

may be comprehended under the
titles of food, accommodation, and
cloaths.

But property in land, money, or
effecs, iecures the poffeflion of

such

such things, and is therefore a
principal article 'of interest.

The state of -a man's interest

fluctuates by his profits and his
lofles.

Men Wthffe 'ruling paflion is

the desire of pirofit, or tie fear of
loss, are faid.to be interested.

This paflion is comprehended

in the law of felf'prefe-rvation, and
is a partial application of this
law, founded in-i:ll'opin0ion of the
great consequence of cxternal
th-ings.

Opinions, and their confequen-

ces, are mlore tor lets prevalent, in
proportion to the prevalence: of
circumitances by.:-which men are
led to.entertain-fuch opinions.

For this reason intereftednefs is
very prevalent.

ccis that ingrofs our first atten-
tion.

3. The continued care of eflate

or fortune that is necessary whcre-
ever property is eftabliflhed.

.. The rank which riches arc
iuppofed to bestow.

From this last consideration, the

law of eitimation comes to bc
combined vith the law of fclf-prc-

int.erctld patflons of men.

is a misapplication and abuse of
it; substituting the meanneGs of
others for elevation in ourselves.

It is ridiculous to attempt con.

founding the love of virtue with
pride: their tendencies are oppo-
site.

Virtue is a respect for the rights

of men, and esteem of what tends
to the good of mankind.

Pride is a difrefped for the

rights of men, and contempt of
mankind.

S E C T. IV.

Of Vanity.
V' Anity is a conceit of 'perfu-

nal importance, joined to a
p-erpetual desire of admiration.

Men are said to be vain of what
they fuppofc conPiitutes their im-

portanlcc,

portance, as of their persons, for-
tnlle, equipage, talnts, and ad-

Vanity is comprehendled in the

law of elimnation ; for it supposes

It leads to tlhe ali:ation of ac-

tion, not by the desire of admira-
tion or attention.

Men of probity prefer integrity
to any other kind of supposed ex-
cellency; but frequently have a
modest opinion of their own me-
rits.

SECT. VI.

Of Mloral Approbation in general.
M Oral approbation is the

judgement formed of cha-

lcatcrs and actions, as being ex-
cellent or just.

It is opposed to disapprobation
or blame.

The apprehension of excellence,
or dcfect, in other fubjets, as of
beauty or deformity in merely a-
nimal or material natures, is ac-
c:ualpanicd with simple emotions

of

of admiration or contempt: but
the apprehension of excellence or
defeat in ourselves, is accompa-
nied with elation of mind, flame,
and remorse; in others, with com-
placency, veneration, love, pity,
indignation, and scorn.

Men, fond of paradox, have

questioned the reality of moral
difiinctions: but expressions of
praise and blame in every lan.
guage, the importance of mens
actions to mankind, the opposite
nature of dispositions that form
the characters of men, the mos
vehement sentiments of the hu-
man heart, which refer to this
fubje&,--"fow, that the diftincoion
of moral good and evil is real, a:nd
universally acknowledged.

-In treating of moral approba-
tion, four queflions may be fepa'
rately flated.

I What

1. What do men, for the nrtoft
part, approve or blame?

2. By what principle, or con-

fideration, are they dire&ed, in
particular cafes, to bellow their
approbations or cenfiires?.

3. What is the proper subje&E
of approbation or censure ?

4. What is the rule or principle
by which men ought to judge of
moral characters ?

The two first questions are phy?

fical, and belong to this place;
the two last are moral, and their
answer will be comprehended in
the first or most general laws of
morality.

The subjeA of morality has
been greatly perplexed by the
blending of these questions toge-
*her.

The achtal errors and corrup-
tions of men, have been mustered
up as so many proofs, that there is

to the sac ; in moral qucetiion,
to what is good or evil. The facd,

chufing what is better.

If all men were acuated by in-

terest, emulation, pride, or vani-
t v, it would not follow, that pro.
bity is no olbjct o cf teem or de-

mechanics, we infer the law of
gravitation.

Other desires or affecions may

lead us variously to bestow our
efleem or contempt, but none
other will account for our having
efteerm and contempt to bestow.

According to this laWi, men re-

ser the qualities and exertions of
their own nature, together witdl

mnuy

many other particulars, to the opÂ°
pofite predicaments of excellency
and defect.

Yet in this they are not led by

any instinctive or invariable-rule:
they differ in their choice of cha-
ra&ers, and beflow their esteem
on different fubjedts.

One man admired Cato.; -ano-
ther admired CGifar. :

The. affecipon. -.and desires of

men, though different Â£from ap-
probation or esteem,. yet warp
their judgements, and determine
their opinions.

The ambitious and, interested
seldom admire what is. adverse to
their own designs.

Cafar wrote an invective against

the memory of Cato; and though
this, by others, was thought ri-
diculous *, yet it is probable that

he himself was sincere, and real-
ly felt the zeal of Cato for the
preservation of the republic, as
matter of disservice and demerit
to himself.

Men are led, by the prepoffef-

sions of custom, or by superstition,
to approve or condemn mere ex-
ternal rites and observances.

They are led by interest, or am-

bition, :to approve of ations fa-
vourable to their own designs.:

They are led by benevolence to

approve of qualities that fit men
to procure the good of mankind.

So far as the merit, or moral

excellence, ,of a man consists in
fach qualities, we may venture to
affirm, that benevolence, or the
law of society, combined with the
law of estimation, is the principle
of moral approbation *; and that

to bestow our efeem on virtue, is;
to love mankind.

Systems have differed chiefly by
deriving our choice of ations and.
characters, some from. the 'law of
felf-prefervation,: aind others from
the law of society- :' but the fadc
is, that the laws of felf-preferva-
tion, and of so'ciety,' when well.
understood, coincide in alt 'their
tendencies arid applications.

Man .is by nature 'a meriber of

society; his safety, and his en.
joyment, require that he fliould be
preserved what he is by nature;'
his perfecion consists in the ex-
cellency or measure of his natu-
ral abilities and dispositions, or,
in other words, it consists in his
being an excellent part of the fy-
ftem to which he belongs. So
that the effect to mankind should

be the fame, whether the indivi-
dual means to preserve himself,
or to preserve his community:
with either intention he must che-
riih the love of mankind, as the
most valuable part of his .charaCter.
As this is the foundation of pro.
bity, it is that which leads men
to give to probity, as such, the
preference to every other difpofi-
tion or habit of mind a.

In the nature of man, there is
a perception of causes from the
appearance of effecs, and of de-

Sceptics have not denied the re-

No one can refrain believing,

made for the air, the fin for the

and so forth.

The lot of man is mixed, bu:

his nature likewafi is fitted to a
mixed scene.

lie complains of evil in his ex-

ternal circumstances, or in his
own nature and conduct.

The first subjec of complain

is termed pf1fical evil; the fecoLnd,
11Olt7[/.

His complaints of physical cvil

are not Ivmptoms of absolute c-
vil in nature, but the symptoms
of an active nature in himself pro-

pcrly

perly placed, and having proper
excitements to exert its power.

A scene in which there were no

apparent evils to be correAed, or,
what is equivalent, no accefflon of
good to be gained, would be a
scene of inadtion, adverse to the
nature of man.

Or, in other words, a being
that perccived no evil, or had no
want, could have no principle of
activity.

Man, by being employed as
an active power ill the order of
nature, is not made to forego his
own happiness.

His happiness does not depend
on the measure of conveniency he
enjoys, but on the part he ads;
not on his safety, but on the de-
gree of courage he poffefles; not
ton what he gains forhimfelf or

others,

others, but on the degree of ar-
dour and affection he exerts.

Complaints of moral evil are

the symptoms of a progressive or
improving nature.

A being that perceived no mo-

ral evil, or no defet, could have
no principle of improvement.

To remove the complaints of

moral evil, it is necessary that men
were either freed of all imperfec-
tions, or rendered insensible of the
impeffections they have.

The first is impossible: Men

muff have the imperfecions of
created nature.

What is the least possible mea,

sure of these imperfections, we
know not.

But man, imperfect as he is, is
not a blemish in nature.

He has a pungent sense of his
own errors and defects. This is

the

the source of his complaints, and
of his improvements, and is a
beauty in his nature.

He is a voluntary agent, defti-
ned to a&t under the 'following
wife restraint:

That his hurtful dispositions
are painful to himself, and his
beneficial dispositions are plea-
sant.

The suffering, as well as the
enjoyment, in this cafe, is a proof
of beneficence in the. power that
inflicts it.

3. Every part, in the order of
nature, is calculated for the pre-
servation of the whole.

Things the most remote, are
made to concur to the fame falu-
tary purposes.

The order of the planetary fy-

siem is calculated for the prefer-
vation of every being that occu-
pies any part of this system.

are to be classed with moral laws ".

Moral law, as referred to intel-
ligent natures, is any general ex-
preflion of what is good.

It is the: charaderifti & of intelli-
gent beings, to ad from opinion,.
and to chufe what, in their opi-
nion, is best.

To ad from determinate inftindt,
is the charajeriftic. ofi mere--ani-::
nmals. . . :

. .

To aa without object or opi-
nion, is insanity or madness.

Hence the nature of what is
good, where-ever apprehended or
expressed, implies an obligation
to determine the choice of every
rational being to which it refers.

Moral laws .may be confidered?;
under different afpeds, and 'dif-
tinguinled by different titles.; .

Virtue, . .

Confidered in refpeC to their

Contidered in rcfpec& to the te-;

probity, fipported by wxif-

Probity is the love of mankind.
Wisdom is the :kuowledge and
choice of what is good.

Tempe-

Temperance is the power to ab.

icain from mean pleasures, in be-
half of what is more valuable.

Fortitude is the power of fur-

mounting difficulties, or of bra-
ving dangers, in behalf of wor-
thy objeas, or in the course of
worthy engagements.

These personal qualities confti-

tute the virtue or excellency of
a man; and are in sac his state

A Ccording to Vulgar opinion,

men are to be counted hap-

desires gratified or disappointed.

But if happiness be the state of
greater enjoyment of which hu-
man nature is suseptible, it will
follow in many cafes, that a per-
son is not to be deemed happy for
having his desire gratified, but
wretched for having such a desire.

The malicious is not to be
deemed happy for the gratifica-
tions of his malice, but unhappy
for having this pafion.

The fool is not to be deemed
happy for poilfling what he ad-
mires, but unhappy for admiring
what is of no value.

impossible to ascertain the limits
of their progress.

Philosophers have been cenfuret

as recommending a perfection too
high for human nature:

W\ould it theref6re be reason-

It

It is the object of human reason,
to distinguish perfections from de-
seas; and it is the tendency of
human nature, to make some pro-
grefs in all its. pursuits, whether-
worthy or unworthy.'

If the object of pursuit be good,
every flep in the progress mufft be
an acceflion of happiness.

Philoso.phers: mu-R be, .yery ,ab-,

surd, if they suppose, that men
attain to any thing above their
strength. '. '

The apprehension of what is
perfect, is the- guide and incen-
tive to improvements ..

end, but he may direct his m0o-

Such phrases, we suppose, may

is in our own power; to value
the engagements of a worthy and.

sole evil. : "

It is happyto have continually
in view, that we are -members of

miankind ;, that we are instruments
in the hand of God for the good
of his creatures; that if we are ill
members of society, or unwilling
instruments in the hand of God,
we do our utmost to counterat
our nature, to quit our station,
and to undo ourselves.

I am in theJ ation which God has
aNfgned me, fays Epidetus. With
this refletion, a man may be hap-
py in every station ; without it,
he cannot be happy in any. Is
not the appointment of God fuffi-

In these qualities, the diflinc-
tion of right and wrong fubfilts.

This diflinction is to be found
in the oppofirion of benevolence
to malice, of wifldoi to folly, of
courage to fear, and of rational
ocupation to fenilality and dil-
i;pation.

Let no one complain, that this

law presents an object beyond the
conception of most men, and be-
yond the influence of any single
man ..

It requires nothing beyond

these limits; but it requires, that
a man Sfould love where-ever he
conceives a fellow-creature fuii
ceptible- of happiness or. misery,
.and that he should do good;.where-
evcr he 'has' influence.

This afieEtion being an active

principle, requires, -o inspires,
all the qu:lities which are requi-
,ie -to attain its end, or all the
qualities which fit one man to pro-
curie the good of another.

circumstances.

Cafes are varied indefinitely;
and rules of action being general,

The only direction on which
men can rely in every particular
cafe, is the discernment of a wife
and benevolent mind.

SEC T. VII.

Difference of Choice.
THE different choice of park

ties interested in the effect

of any action, arises from opi-
nion.

One person believes that to be
good for himself, which another

Q p person

person believes to be evil. In
their requisition of beneficent ac-
tions, they ditllr accordingly
One man requires as a favour
what another wvould resent as an
injury.

There is. no external effect of

which men may not entertain con.
tradictory opinions, even of life
and of death.

The father among ;he Esquimaus
requires, at a certain age, that
his own children should put him
to death.

The widow in Europe desires tc

have a good settlement made by
her deceased husband: in India,
Ihe desires to be burnt on his fune
ral pile.

In every cafe, actions are rec

quired as the effets or expreflions
of kindneis and regard.

## SECT. VIII. Difference of Interpretation.

S E C T. VIII.

Diference of Interpretatioh .

r
t' many instances; cxternal ac-

tions are, in their own nature,

indifferent, or of no efedt-; but
are the established signs arid ex-
pressions of negedt or attention,
of good or of ill will, or of some
affedion or disposition.

Such are many rcligious rites in
every country, and many ceremo-
nies observed in common life. E-
ven adtions of mhore consequence,
are frequently more regarded on
*'tiount of their meaning, than
en account of any other efetd.

So far as actions arc mere ex-

i'relions, the choice of them, like
that of words, is perfectly arbi-
ilary; and nations may difler

The definitions of crimes vary

in the law of different countries;
because different overt acts are fpe-
cified as the marks of guilt.

Terms of praise or blame, have

not their prcciic equivalent in dif-
ferent languages; because men
combine variously, under different
terms, the circumfianccs from
which, they infer mcrit or dcnmc-

Such parties are possessed' of

their original rights; but having
no convention, can have none of
those rights, and none of those ob-

If either party flall commit an

rious in different states; in some
nations permitting arbitrary im-

the discretion of the magistrate.

Powers of this fort are frequent-

ly usurpations on the part of the
magistrate, not his rights.

Punishments applied according

to some fixed rule of law, give
liability to the principles dfjuftice;

produce terror, and defiroy the

Of the Sanctions of Duty in general.
.A . LAW of duty is an expref-

fioin of what a person' ought
to do from- choice; and in

doing which, he is said 'to have
merit; or in doing the contrary,
to have demerit.;

The first application of the fun-
damental law of morality is pro-

hibitory,

hibitory, forbidding the commis-
sion of wrongs.

The second is positive, requi-

ring every external effect of virtue,
or of good-will to mankind.

But aCts of good-will or benefi-
cence cannot be extorted by force.

The objet of compulsory law,.

is the preservation of parties expo-
fed to wrongs; wh;o, in.defending
themselves, may, even by force,
oblige others to desist from. inju-
ries.,

The objedctof morality, in what

relates to the duties of men, is the
virtue of .those who, ad... ;,.

Compulsion would .alienate -the
affections .of men. .

be robberies. . ; .

Cd H AA` P; It

Of the Sanclion of Religion.
IR Eligion is the 'entiment of

the mind relating' to God.

The fiantibn of' religion is `its

tendency to influence mens con-
dud.

This tendency is of two kinds.
The 'firftis, -to make men love

wisdom and beneficence, as being
the characteriftics'of the supreme
being, whom they adore; and to
make them love their situations,
and their duties,' as being ap-
pointed by providence.

The second is, to-make them

hope

hope for rewards, and to fear pu-
nifhments..

The religious doctrine of. re-
wards and punifhmnents,- is a fpe-
cies of compulsory law, extend-
ing to all the thoughts and incli-
nations, as well as the acions,..of
men.

This law, in all its ex-tent, can
be safely applied by. every perfoa;
only to -himself. ..

When magistrates think them.
selves. armed with the fancion.. of
religion, and intitled to restrain.
thoughts as well as actions, -they
attempt what is placed beyond the
reach of, their power.

Superllition, or the abuse of re-
ligion, has been accompanied with
very fatal effects:

With a misapplication of moral.

esteem, and the substitution of .fri-
volous rites for moral, duties; Mrwith

The Sanclions of Pzblic Repute.

f- Hefe sanctions include the

- ninfluence of prevailing opi-

nions and examples, together with
the commendations and censures
men betlow on the ations that
please or offend them..

The influence of prevailing opi-

nions and examples, arises from
the social nature of man; and is
one condition by which men are
fitted to act in companies and so-
cieties.

The tendency of this influence

is good or evil, according to the
nature of the opinions or examples
that prevail.

Nothing

Nothing diftinguifies men of a
happy nature more, than that
force with which they are some-
times able to correct false opi-
nions, and with which they are
always able to refill their conta-
gion.

It is part in the social nature of
man, to desire praise, and to shun
blame. :

This ptuts it iin the power of e-

very perfori to, riewvard' aitionis: a-
greeable, and' to: punif actions
disagreeable, to himself: but as
commendation and censure are
frequently ill difiributed, it is a
great weakness to be- guided
chiefly by such considerations.

T has been observed, that a fool

that a knave can do nothing like

The law of external ac'ion is so

efiential to morality, that men
-ery frequently confine the whole
of morality to this law.

But virtue is in reality a qualifi-

cation of the mind; although the
term equivalent to virtue, in every
language, implies all the required
effects and appearances of this
aralification.

Its constituents are, Disposition,
Skill, Application, and Force.

Corresponding to the number of

these constituents, virtue has been
divided into four capital .banch-
es, called
, the C.rdinal Vir:.tes.

T hes are, .J'ic or P rob'it, Pizl-
dciice, Te.zper;zce, and Fortitude .

Justice or probity is the regard

lhown to the rights and happiness
of mankind.

* This division is so natural, that it has ail

vw ,.ys preCented. itielfwhen we hav e tr'eated of tle
felicity or excellence competent to man's nature,

Those

Those effTcs of justice which

mere innocence implies, are re-
quired under the fandion of com-
pulfory law.
'Those that constitute benefi-
cence, are required. under :tle
fanltidns of duty only.

Prudence is that discernment

by which men diffiinguifh the va-
lue of ends, and the- iitefs of
means to obtain them.

Without this qualifica.ion, men

are not fitted to acd wvith any
measure of ieadinefs, consistency,
or good effect.

Temperance is abstinence from

inferior pleaflares, or amufemenits,
that mislead our pursuits.

No one can apply himself effec-

tually to any worthy purpose, who-
is liable to the interruption of
mean ?leasures or amulements,
that occupy ail improper part of

X. 2 his

his time, that stifle his affeions,
or impair his talents.

The maxim of temperance is,

That a person having once afcer-
tained what his best and happiest
engagements are, should count
every moment loft, that, witlhont
necefilty, is otherw-ise employed.

Fortitude is the power to with-

sand opposition, difficulty, and
dansger.

All the .good qualifications of

men have a reference to some es-
fedt to be produced, and to some
difficulty that is to be overcome.
Hence dispositions and capacities
of any fort are of no avail, Wvith-
out resolution, and force of mind.

Piety is the exercise of venera-

tion and love; first, towards God;
next, towards those who by na-
ture or choice are proper objeds
of our refped and affection.

The exprefflons of piety to. God
are either fixed or arbitrary.

Its fixed expreflions are ads of

beneficence, which' concur with
the providence of God in promo-
ting the good of his creatures.

Its arbitrary expressions are the

different rites etlabliflied in differ-
ent countries.

FriezlJ7ip.. is the beneficence

of private parties, proceeding
from motives of particular esteem
and attachment.

This includes the reciprocal du-

ties of parent and child, of hus-
band and wife, and of all other
private relations,

The

The duties of the parent are,

to maintain, to protet, to edu-
cate, his child; and, as far as he
is able, to eftablifll and to sec.ure
lis state or condition.

The duties of the child. are; to

carry every mark of piety, defe-
rence, and obedience, and to: make
every necefiary return-of care and
of support.

Many, of the duties of huiband

and wife are conventional; and, as
such, are matter of ftrit law;.
but no law can supersede the in-
clinations of the heart.

Consanguinity is a natural tie.

The fortunes of men are common--
ly involved in those of their fami-
ly; and. relations are, on account
of this connection, among. the first
or nearest objectsof. beneficence.

Gratitude is the return made
for favours received.. . .

Men of probity are.neither.un-

grateful,

grateful, nor jealous of ingrati-
tude in others.

To require a base adion under

the title of gratitude; is to forfeit
the title of benefaicor.

The returns dcue from the grate-

ful, cannot be afceltained by any
precise measure, nor can they be
exa ed by force.

The intention of the benefacrGr

is imore to be regarded, than the
value of his benefit.

VWere it eibl .-ifhed, that returns

co-id be exaded by force, it would
follow, that benefits could not be
diftin guified from fees, nor the
eslecs of gratitude from thole of
confiraint.

The ingratitue of mankind is

sometime alleg as allen a excuse
for negleeting good offices; but
i i: the buinLefs of a man to per-
form his ou-n part, not to anifwer

for

for the returns which others may,
or may not, be disposed to make.

Liberality is the free communi-

cation of what is ours, to oblige
others.
. ; .

Charity is the free communica-

tion of what is ours, to-relieve the
distressed.

Undiftinguiflling charity is per-
nicious intrading nations.

It is a wife maxim in trading

nations, That no person able to.
earn his bread should be main-
tained gratuitously.

But charity to those wh0o.lT:,-

?- } u, and are unable to earn
any, is a duty .of the strongest
obligation, and a very important.
objec of public concern.

Civility is a guarded behaviour

in the ordinary intercourse of so-
ciety, to avoid giving offence.

Politezefs is a behaviour intend-

S E C T. III.

Duties referred to Prudence.
IT is the object of prudence, to

direct a man in what he is to

wvif for himself, for his friend,
for his country, and for mankind.

In this sense, prudence is the

guide or directory in every duty;
but in its more limited accepta-
tion, it refers more particularly
to the duties which affect a man's
state or condition.

These duties may be referred tc

the following heads: Decenc,,
Propiiety, ilodefly, OEconomy, De-
cfion, and Caution.

Decency is the agreeableness of

a person's appearance and carriage
to the sense and opinion of other
men.

The

The rules of decency are prohi-

bitory, and forbid whatever would
offend, in nudity, filth, or obfce-
nity.

Propriety is the suitableness of a

person's behaviour to his nature,
his age, his lation, and rank.

There is in all the external es-

fecls of virtue, as being suitable
to man's nature, a propriety that
may be confidered apart from
their other recommendations.

Diffidence, and a cautious ap-

proach to the manners and, pre-
tensions of manhood, are proper
to youth.

Ref/nolion is proper to manhood.
Cahlnnefs and Deliberaton to a.g,
Dignity and Rej'ere, without

contelmptuorurncfs or petulance,
are proper to men of high lfation.

Deference, without servility, is
troper to men of inferior rank.

Y Mode/t

ModeJly is a proper reserve on
every subject of felf-eftimation.

It forbids ostentation of what

we possess, of what we have done,
or of what we have suffered.

OEcono11my-is the proper adjust-

ment of a person's expence to his
fortune.

Where fortune constitutes rank

and power, ceconiomy is required
to preserve independence and free-
dom, ...

Sensuality and gaiing are al-
verse to good .cconomy.

Decifi.zn is a s'easonable and re-

solute choice of what a person
,ought to do.

In some cafes, hesitation is ec

qual to a total purpose of inac'ion.
Every opportunity is loft, and e-
very meaftire comes too late.

Cau!ti.n consists in a proper at-
tention to all the. difficulties that

The great objects of caution are,
not to engage in what is above

selves to persons;- that mislead or
deceive.

Duties referred to Temperances-
DUties referred to temperance

may be comprehended un-.

cation,

Sobriety is. the moderae 'use of

food, and of other animal grati--
fications.

The general tendency of fen-

fuality,: is to beget habits of sloth,.
and neglect of affairs.

Y z The'

The immoderate use of intoxica-
ting drugs, or liquors, have these
effecs in a high degree. It recon-
ciles men, otherwise of an adive
difrofition, to inoccupation and
idleness.

The debauch of the sexes being

foinetimes joined with passion,
may occasion a continued or ha-
bitual neglea of affairs.

Application is the preference of
business to amufemiene.-

Bi3.,nifs is supposed to terminate

in some serious- purpose; amuse-
ment in mere pastime.
Diipat-ions is. aweaknefs of the
mind, disabling it from chufing
or prosecuting the occupations
that would engage it most esec-
tually, and with most advantage.

have the highest merit.

Hence beneficent .actions per-

formed in the face, of dangers,

give examples of miifhiefs done
without inducement or provoca-

A ciimle is an injury done from

malice, jealoufyr, revenge, ava-
rice, or some other paflion that
sets manekind at variance.

An offince is a wrong done in

the gratification of f!bme palfion
in its own nature comiftent with
amitv..

A fault is a wrong- done from.
intt.e.tion or ignorance.

Faults

Faults of inattention are cul-

pable in proportion to the moment
and importance of the subject.

Faults of ignorance are more or

less culpable, 'as the defecA of
knowledge argues neglect and in'
attention.

It is a general maxim, That ig-

norance of the fa& may be ad-
mitted as a plea of innocence'
but not ignorance of the law.'

Ignorance of'natural law, or of

duty, would be one of the greateift
defects ot a rational nature.

-Of PopulozHnes. :
T-HE value of numbers is pro-

portioned to their union and
characer.

Numbers without union or
virtue, do not constitute strength.

A people sometimes, in confe-
quence of their numbers, become
disunited and corrupted.

If they inhabit a large and ex-

tensive territory, they are difuni-
ted, and lose fight of their conmi
munity. A few ingrofs the nma.

with-hold from the many evcrv
fubjcet of public zeal, or politi-
tical occupation. The greater
part are thrown into a itate of
languor and obscurity, and sus-
ser themselves to be governed at
diilcretion.

Human nature, in states of a

moderate extent, has profpcrcdt
and excelled; but in states over-
'grown, has generally declined and
degenerated.

If great numbers are croudtc

into narrow diftrids, or citici.
they are exposed to corruption;
become profligatc, licentious, fc-
ditious, and incapable of publi,
afifcctions.

The union of a people depend:

on the arrangements or ditioli-
tions bv which their forces may
be combined for the fervicc ot
the iate.

ThleP

The ulnion of the people in re-

p;blics, arises more from their
afsticion to the community, than
fr)m the power eitablli1icd to cn-
fr:;ce thcir services.

In monarchics, it arifcs from

the love of perlonal dignities, to
which individuals aspire in serving
the flare.

In despotism, it arises entirely

from the power that is prepared
to enforce the i'ervices of the peo-
pie.

The charaAer of a people, con-

fitered as a national resource, is
to be estimated from their fitness
to reap, and to preserve, or im-
prove, the advant.ics of their con-
lfitution. and to tupport their
country in pur{iiit of its objccts.

As the use of wealth is to main-

' 3p 1'

tides or commodities are valuable
in proportion to the numbers they
maintain and accommodate.

The means of- fubfilence are

most valuable, because without
them -men cannot exist.

The means of accommodation

which contribute to:'the preferva-
tion of men, and to the increase of
their -vigour,and healt,. ,are next

But articles of mere ornament
are of no value at all.

The luxury of a people is to be

elfimated from-their consumption
of mere ornaments.

Articles of ornament -:are fre-

The price of a commodity is

measured by the quantity of any
other commodity-that is common-
ly, or occasionally, given in ex-
change for it.

Price

Price is most commonly express-
ed, and paid, in money.

Hence money is confidered as

the equivalent of all, commodities,

01' Revenuc.
T Hat part of national wealth

which is allotted for purpo-
fes of state, is the public revenue.

The public revenue may arise

from demesne and unappropria-
ted fubjecs, or from taxes.

The first is the earliest fpecics

of revenue in rude nations, and
is suited to their indolence, and
ignorance of lucrative arts.

The second is better filited to

the industry and skill of commer-
cial nations.

It is not the intereli of commner-

cial nations, that aly fiubjed
should remain unappropriated.
While a fubijecl remains unappro-
priated, it is commonly ncglcted.

Revenue arising from taxation,

A a may

may iicreafe together with the
numbers, wealth, and frugality,
of the people.

In judging of the absolute or

comparative expediency of differ-
ent taxes, the following- axi6om
nmay be admitted.

I. That the exigencies of the

Rfate must be provided for at any
hazard or expence to the fubje&,

2. That in levyimg taxes,' no
subjec be minneceffarily bialy derit.e

3. That the security of the sub-

iect, or that of his property, be
not impaired.

4. That no useful' branch of
trade be unneceffariy 'burdened.

5. That taxes least felt as grie-
vances be preferred.

6. That the -least burdensome

method of collecting taxes be cho-
fen.

I. B. The method of farm ap-
pears, from experience, to be

more

more burdensome than that of
revenue-office.

Taxes may be referred to four
general heads:

Capitation,, AffiElient, Cu-
ftiqs,, and Excise.

Capitation is a tax on the per-

son, .and falling equally on the
poor. and the rich...

Â£Capitation may be oppreflive to

the poor, ,withoutlevying from the
richl, what they are able to fur-
nih .to the fiate.

Capitation is .a symptom of de-
fpotic and opprefive government.

Afeffmlent is a tax on riches,

and is proportioned to the eflate
afl.fced..

can: be fold-'vc- only hypothetically.

-Such queitions imay-be- put on
four differeat suppositions.

FIRsT

FIRST SUPPOSITION.

The supposition of a people per-

fecly virtuous, diffinguifhed from
each other only by their original
differences, and forming states of
small extent.

Such a people are fitted to go-
vern thenuelves.:

They need no precaution against

the commission of crimes,. or the
abuses of power..

The sole object of government

is, to assemble and to direct their
force for national purposes.

Being of small extent, the whole.

may be occasionally or periodical-
ly assembled.

Being perfectly virtuous, every

one will be willing to bear his
fiare of the public burdens, and.
will receive, in his turn, that.con-
fidence and truft.for which he is

b 3 by

by his capacity and experience
qualified.

They have no adventitious dif-

tindions to mar the effed of
their personal qualities.

They may stipulate to be go-

verned by the majority of their
own number, or occasionally by
tingle men; but to oblige such
men by force to: resign the sense:
of their own minds, and to fol-
low that of another, were, by the
flppofition, to substitute vice for
virtue.

This, however, is a mere sup-

position; for no- entire- nation
w4as ever known to be perfectly
-irmtuous.

SECOIND SUPPOSITION.

A people in whom the virtuous

?.nd the vicious are mixed; who
admit adventitious diftindions in

different

different degrees, and form states
of various extent.

This is not mere supposition, it

;is fad, and the: most general de-
scription of mankind. , ; . ;

If there be no; great, separation

or diftindion.of rank and condi-
tion;.
.If virtue greatly prevails over
,vice ;If the slate be of finall ex-
tent;-- --; : :

.-, '.:,' ."':

. Such a people: are fit for demo-.
cracy.

Their numbers admit of being
assembled in.colledive bodies..

Their virtues and their inftitu-

tions may prevent crimes, and- a-
buses of power.

They may reap the advantages

of democracy, in a manner that
will more than compensate its in-
conveniencies. . .

If such a people be separated
into different orders .or classes,

they

they are fitted to aristocracy, mix-
ed republic, or mixed monarchy.

If in two classes, one is diftin-

guiiied from the other by a con-
iidc-able superiority, they are fit
for ariitocracy.

Commercial nations of a finall

extent are, in the result of diftinc-
tions that arise from the practice
or' arts, and the unequal diftribu-
tion of property, best fitted to a-
rifrocratical government, or to
mixed republic.

The inferior class, if not great-

ly (debased or corrupted, may
have a ihare in the government,
either by a negative on the deter-
minations of the ariilocracy, or
bv being intrrftcd, not with :n
acive part in the government, but
only with the choice of those liho
are to acat for them.

The fame supposition applied
to states of a greater extent, and

to-

to a people among whom a great-
er variety of rank is elablifhsed,
will justify the preference of mix-
cld monlarchy.

it were happy for:minnkiid, if,

together with changes of circulm-
stances, they could alwvays make
suitable changes in government.

Where changes of circumltance:

are gradual, correfpoading changes,
ofgovernaent takeplite; but fwi-:
den innovations of any fort, preci-i
pitate men into situations in which:
they are not qualified to ad.

THIRD SUI'PrOIt'ON.

A people, on xwhoile va!ity, andi

lenie of peribnal importance, ra-
ther than virtue, the Ilate must.

cial !d Fol!itic.l duitie-. A ttpeople

'c lttious ilburdination itksl'

place, without any example, or
any desire, of equality.

Such a people are not fit to go-
vern themselves.'

Their subordination -must ter-
minate in a prince or mnonarch.

They require monarchy as a

bond of union, and as a source
of honour....-. ' '.:-'

The fubordinater.anis wilhccourt

his favour, and consult their own
dignity, by ations,: "eith/er :fplen-
did in themselves, or useful to the
state, whilst they are serviceable
to the king. .

The members of the- fiate are:

drawn together, and moved in a
body, not by their love to. the

community,

community, or to mankind, but
by their veneration for their
common superior, and by their
expecations from ,their common
fqurce:ofpreferment. and honour.

sU-p~ttÂ·i$y' i,

A people perfeEtly icious,.withi-

out sense ,of honour, ;or heeditary
diftinc'ions.. Â· :: .: :

.Such a people must be restrain-
ed by force.' - ':'

Every.- constitution, even lihat'
which confides moft'iii the' virtieT

of

of the subjed, must employ force
to repress crimes.

If the whole people be inclined

to commit crimes, and be restrain-
ed only by fear, the profpet of
prompt and terrifying punish-
ments must be continually placed
in their view.

This supposition may be em-

ployed as an apology for defpo-
tifin.

Where every person is disposed

to commit crimes, the fewer that
have power so much the better.

When all power is committed

to one person, even supposing
himself to be a criminal, it is hit
interest, for the most part, to re.
frrain the crimes of others.

His severities, or cruelties, by

the fiippofition, can no where as-
flict the innocent.

His dominions, though, like a
prison, committed to the keeping

o{

of vile and merciless men, is ne-
verthelefs the only fit place to re-
ceive those who cannot be other-
wife restrained from injustice.

But this cafe, like that which

was' first stated, of a people per-
fedly virtuous, is a mere fuppofi-
tion, and never was realised in
the character of any people.

Men are generally as far from

the extreme of perfec vice, as they
are from that of perfect virtue.

They who contend, that defpo-

tical government is in tfa& the
belt for mankind, proceed upon
three fiuppofitions, all equally vio-
lent and false.

I. That all men would commit
crimes if they durst.

2. That crimes cannot be re-

strained without discretionary
powers.

3. That a person to whom
discretionary powers are commit-

C c ted,

ted, will employ them to repress
the crimes of others, but not to
commit crimes of his own.

These suppositions are contrary
to experience. :.

The fact is, that the manners of

men are various; and that the
fame penal laws, and forms of
justice, by which a people may be
successfully governed in a virtuous
age, will not always be sufficient
to restrain them in ages corrupted.

Wthen the criminal paflions in-

crease in violence and boldness,
it may be necessary to increase the
measure of punishments.

'When crimes multiply,. and

criminals are enabled to- employ
the forms of law as the fubterfu-
ges of iniquity, it may be necef-
fary to alter fueh defective forms:
but it never can be necessary to
deprive the innocent of all the de-
fences of reason andjuftice; for

the

the fame reason and justice which
protec the innocent, may con-
demn the guilty.

In times of occasional tumult,

popular frenzy, or rebellion, it
may be: :neceflary to. treat those
who commit such crimes, not as
subjects amenable to the laws,
but as- enemies, who, by inva-
ding the public- peace, have de-
prived every .itizen ;of his. safety,
and:.who therefore cannot have
the benefit of: laws until the pu-
blic has recovered its security.

Such domeffic disorders, like

foreign wars, render difcretiona-
ry power occasionally necessary;
but this neceflity is only tempora-
ry.

For the most part, even in cor-

rupted states, it is as much the
interest of the subject as of the
magistrate, to keep the peace, and-
to repress crimes.

C c 2 Continual

Continual defpotifin is never a

necessary nor an useful expedient;
it is an uLirpation, and a national
misfortune.

It tends to produce that extre-

mity of vice to which it is fuppo-
fed to be adapted as a remedy.

The object of defpotical govern-

ment, is not to secure the subjee
in the pofieffion of his rights, but
to.make him a.- prperty; not to
fiapprefs vice, but to suppress the
highest and noblest virtues of the
heart, public spirit, independ-
ence, and courage,

## SECT. V. Of the Distribution of Office fitted to the Constitution.

SECT. V.
Of the Difribuztion of Offce ftted to-

the :ConJsitution.

N free governments of every de-
nomination, where law is ne-

ceffary, the law must be enaCed,.
interpreted, and executed. Hence
the offices or :fincions of state
are, legislation, jurifdicion, 'and .
execution.

Legislation, under every con-

ftitution of government, is the im-
mediate ad of the sovereign power,
and cannot be delegated without
transferring the sovereignty.

This. rule does not exclude the

concurrence of councils, nor the
observance of forms suited to the
contlitution.

Under democracies, the legifla-
tion is excrcifcd by the collective

C c 3boy L:

body; but it is not necessary that
the colledive body should delibe-
rate, as well as decide.

The colleaive body may name

senates, or select councils, to pre-
pare questions of legislation.

They may vary the form 'of
colleding the votes, or of pro-
muigating the law.

They may fix, at discretion,.

what numbers are required to
.zontitute a legal assembly, and
what proportion of those present
will decide any question in the as-
firmative.

UTnder ariflocracies, the col-

leaCive body of those who govern,.
whether by elective or hereditary
title, must exercise the legifla-
"ure.

They may a&, notwithftandl-

ing, under the fame forms and
imitadtions that have been men-

tionede

tioned as compatible with the,
sovereignty of the whole people.

Under monarchy, the legifla-
ture is exercised by the king,

The king flands in. need of

councils ; and his legislative power
may be qualified by the forms of
registration, or promulgation, re-,
quired to give the force of law to.
his ediCts.

In mixed government of any

fort, the legislature must be exer-
cifed by the concurrence of all the
collateral powers..

If a law could be enaced with-.

out the concurrence of any single
power, that power might. be sup,
preffedby the others.

If the supposed collateral powers,

were to assemble, and decide que-
itions of legislation by the ma-
jority, any way defined, the go-
vernment .would cease to be mix-,
ed,.

The.

The sovereignty of collateral

powers is compatible with a va-
riety of forms relating to the pro-
posing and the enacting of laws.

Sovereigns of any denomina-

tion, who have fiufered courts of
justice to follow cuflom as a rule
of decision, are to be understood
as having established that custom
into law.

Jurisdiction, or- the office of

judge, is, to interpret the law, and
to apply it in particular cafes.

This office, under every conifi-

tution, should be disjoined from
that of legislation.

The sovereign, being accuflom-

ed to will, or to command, can-
not submit merely to interpret, or
to follow a rule.

Particular cafes are modified by

circumstances that create preju-
dice, or excite passion.

The

The sovereign, having no fupe-

rior, may follow prejudice or
passion at discretion.

The sovereign having enacted

the law, would, under the in-
fluence of special motives, make
free to dispense with it.

Popular or numerous assemblies
would be swayed by faction.

Princes would be swayed by

their passions,' and by .folicita-
tion. .

Two queflions may be put re-
lating to judicature:

I. Who ought to judge?
2. Of what numbers are courts
of jufice best composeed.

i. Where-ever. laws are greatly

multiplied, the knowledge of law
becomes a profeflion.

No judgement can be safely gi-

ven without the counsel of those
who are knowing in the .law. .

The"

The office for which counsel is

necessary, is that of pointing
out the law, and the whole law,
in any particular cafe.

Persons who are not lawyers by

profession, may iriterpret-and ap-
ply a law which is pointed out to
them; in the manner of the judges
at Rome, and ofthe juries in Great
Britain.

Beside the couiIelT' empiloyed by

parties, the public imay employ
counsel for jutitce and law.' This
is the nature of official judges in,
Great Britain.

Jurifdidcion -committed entire-

to official judges, is attended with
the following inconveniencies.

(I) The official judge being a

continual magistrate, may enter-
tain the prejudices of the magi-
ftrate against the subjed.

(2) The peculiar prejudices and

partialities

partialities of the official judge, if
he has any, may be known.

They who enjoy his favour, are

tempted to trespass in hopes, of
impunity, or to commence vexa-
tious suits in.hop.es of success...

They who apprehend his dif-

pleasure, do not.feel themselves
secure even in poiffiefi.o of inno-
cence...

ThefeiinÂ¢0onveniencies .are remo-

vcd,.-in a. great measure, bythe
eftabliflmuent of judicatures in the
Roman form, ,or in that ofjuries.

The juryman is equally inte-

refted.to, protect the innocent, and
to condemn .the guiilty . -.

Juries may therefore -be intrust-

ed with some measures of difcre-
tionary power, to mitigate the
rigours of law, or to supply its
defects. . .

Where a people. are divided:in-
to a number of separate orders

and

and classes, as those of Patrician,
Equefirian, and Plebeian, Lords
and Commons, the rights of one
order are not safely intrusted to
the judgement of another; and it
would be expedient, that every
party were judged by his peers.

2. Under popular, or republi-

can governments, of any fort,
courts of justice are best compo-
fed of few members.

Courts composed of many mem-

bers carry popular fation and
party into the judgement-s -.
The individual hopes to screen
himself even in judging falsely,
underthe authority and credit of
the whole body.

No one is accountable; no one

is conspicuous; all are tempted
to humour their party, and to
judge at discretion.

Under monarchy, courts ofju-
lice are belt composed of many.

Here

Here the influence of the crown

is more to be dreaded, than the
fadcion of the people.

This influence can less overawe

or corrupt numerous bodies, than
single men, or a few.

Numerous bodies, in their de-

liberations, admit of the zeal and
ardour that animate popular assem-
blies; and even whilif they do
not judge more impartially than
single men would do, they judge
*wilh more independence.

The spirit of faction that in re-

publics constituted corruption, in
monarchies tends to prevent a
greater corruption, servility to
those in power.

The office of the executive is,

to apply the force of the fiate for
national purposes:

I. To give effect to the laws.
2. To defend the community a-
gainft foreign enemies.

D d Occasions

Occasions on which the exe-

cutive must be exerted, are either
continual or casual.

The sovereign in republican go-

vernments, consisting of the whole
people, or of numerous bodies,
cannot exercise the executive.

Such bodies cannot be conti-

nually assembled, nor ready to
aflemble at all times.'

'The resolutions of the executive

require more secrecy and dif-
patch than can be had in any
numerous or popular assemblies.

Affairs that come in course, or

that admit of delay, may be com-
mitted to senates, or to 'elect
councils. Such are the manage-
ment of public revenue, negotia-
tions, and treaties.

Affairs that may come fortui-

toufly, and by surprise, that will
not admit of delay, must be com-
mitted to single men; as to the

magistrate,

magistrate, or officer who has the
keeping of the peace, and the
leading of armies.

power are variously restrained un-
der different constitutions. "

the short duration.of office in.the
person of aly individual, by the.
vigilance and emulation of his
competitors, if not by the yir-,
tue and moderation of those. in
