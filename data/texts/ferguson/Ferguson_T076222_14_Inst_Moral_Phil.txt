# INTRODUCTION.

INS T IT U UTES

OF
MORAL PHILOSOPHY.

INTRODUCTIO N.

SE CTIO N I.

Of Knowledge in general *.
A\ L 1, knowledge is either that

of particular fadts, or that
of general rules.

The knowledge of faEts is prior

to that of rules; and is. the first re-
quifite in the practice of arts, and
in the conduct of affairs.

* Bacon's novum organum.

A A

A general rule is the expression

of what is common, or is required
to be common, in a number of par-
ticular cafes.

General rules are the result of ob-

servation, or will; and consequent-
ly are derived from mind.

Praaice, or condut of any fort,

though regulated by general rules,
has a continual reference to parti-
culars.

In speculation, we endeavour to
establish general rules.

In pracice, we study particular

cafes, or apply general rules to re-
gulate our conduct.

SECT. II.

Of the ObjefSs of Study.
T HESE are, History, Science,

and Art,

History.

History is the knowledge of par-
ticulars in detail.,

Science is the knowledge of ge-
neral rules, and their applications.

Art is the application of. know-
ledge to practice.

Any general rule, expressing what

is fat, or what is right, is termed a
law of nature.

A general rule, when applied to

explain or regulate particulars, is
termed a principle; and explanations
or injunctions from principle, are
termed theory, orjfyem. '1 he par-
ticulars to be explained are termed
phaenomena.

Method in science is of two kinds ;
analytic, andTynthetic.

Analytic method, is that by which

we proceed from observation of
fad, or right, in particular cafes, to
establish general rules.

Synthetic method, is that by which.

we proceed from general rules to
their particular applications.

A. 2 Thae

The first is the method of invefti-
gation.

The second of communication,
or of the enlargement of science.

AIgument is of two kinds:
A priore, and a poftcriore.
By an argument a priore, the sa&c
is proved from the law.

By an argument a pofleriore, the
law is proved from the faat.

S E C T. III.

Of the laws of Nature.

OST fubjets in nature may'

IN/ be confidered under two a-
fpeas.

i. In refpe& to the fat, or to;
.itheir adual state.

2. In respect toethe excellence of
which they are susceptible.

Any general expression of the

faal, or of the excellence required,
may be termed, a Lacw of Nature.

The,

The laws of nature are either-
physical or moral.

A physical law is the- general

expression of a faa, uniform to a.
certain extent, in nature.

A moral law is a general ex-.

pression of the excellence required'
in any. subjet; more particularly,.,
of the rectitude required.in human.
affairs..

Physical laws state what is uni--

form, more especially in the opera--
tions of nature..

In every operation, men are dif--

posed to- apprehend an operating.
. power or cause.

Causes are of two kinds :
Efficient, and final..
The efficient cause, is the energy-
or power producing an effeCL.

Although the nature of this ener-

gy is not known in any cafe whate-
ver, yet in every operation we confider
that as the cause.: which precedes or.
attends the operation, and to which.
the effect is always proportional.

A 3., The.:

The final cause, is the end or

purpose for which an effect is pro-
duced.

In supposing final causes, we sup-
pose the existence of mind.

Physical science is the know-

ledge and application of physical-
laws, or of efficient causes, to ex-:
plain and account for appearances.

Moral science is the knowledge

of what is right and proper in the
actions and characters of men.

A phyi.cal law exilts so far only
as it is the fact.

A moral law exiffs in being obli-
gatory.

The subjea from which physical:

laws are coileated, may be claffedt
under four principal heads t

Mechanism, vegetation, animal:
life, and intelligence.

It has not hitherto been made ap-

pear, although sometimes attempt-
ed, that these operations can be-
comprehended under the. fame phy-.
{ical laws,

The.

The phaenomena of vegetation

are not comprehended under any
known law of mechanism, much
less those of animal life. or intelli-
gence.

The fubije&s of. moral science are,

any matters of choice, together with::
the nature and aations. of free :and
voluntary agents.

The immediate use of physical
laws, is theory.

The immediate uses of moral law,i
are choice, practice, and.conduct.,

SE C T. IV.

Of- JTheory.
P HYSICAL science consists in

theory.

Theory consists in referring par-

ticular operations to: the principles,
or general laws, under. which they
are comprehended; or in referring

particular

particular effeds to the causes from!
which they proceed.

To investigate or to point out any

general rule or law of nature, in
which any particular fad is com--
prehended,- is to account for that.
fad..

Thus Sir Isaac Newton, accounted

for the planetary revolutions, by
showing that they- were compre-
hended in the laws: of motion and:
gravitation,

To pretend to explain phaenome-

na,.by ihowing that they may be-
comprehended in a supposition or
hiyt.othefis, or by applying to them,
metaphorically, the.language proper
to any other fubjete, is illusory in.
science.

Thus the vortex of Descartes, be-.

ing a mere supposition, could not
explain the planetary motions-; andi
the terms, idea, image, or pi;ure..
of things, being terms merely me--
taphorical, cannot explain human,
knowledge or thought..

All

All phaenomena, though not com-

prehended under any known law,
are proper materials of natural hi-
story.

All faats that cannot be explained

by any rule previously known, or
better known than the facas them-
selves, may be termed ultimatefads.

It is evident, that all theory muffl
reft on ultimate fads.

To require .explanation or proof

a priore for every fad, were to sup-
pose that human knowledge requires
an infinite series; which is impossible.:

S E C T. V.
Causes that have retarded the pro-.'

grefs of Science.
I. Tr H E necessary avocations of

TL human life.
A, The love of system, and impa---

tience

tience of delay, in the study of par-
ticulars.

3. Emulation of speculative men,

and desire to flipplant each other as
founders of feds.

4. Prejudice, national or personal.
5. The difficulty of penetrating:

appearances, to discover what opera-
tic'ls ar-p like, what different.

6. Affecation of acuteness, or no-

vel v in contesting the evidence of
ultiiiaite tadts.

7. Vain desire of accounting for
ultimate fa.ds

The principal errors of human

reason are, on the one hand, a rash
aflent, without proper evidence, and,
on the other, indiscriminate fcepti-
cifm, or the despair of knowledge.

S E C. T.

SECT. VI.
Maxims of Reason, to be followed in

speculation, as well as in common
life.

VERY inquiry proceeds upon

SE a supposition that some mea-
sure of knowledge is attainable in
the fubje& to which the inquiry re-
sers. If we despair of knowledge,
we shall cease to inquire.

The evidence of reality is various

and unequal in different instances;
but, in the universe, is sufficient to
open our view into the order of Na-
ture, and, in matters of importance
to human life, is sufficient to decide
our condua.

All evidence may be referred to

four titles, Consciousness, Percep-
tion, Testimony, and Inference.

I. It is the firit maxim of reason,
that nothing is to be admitted with-

out

out that degree of evidence with
which it ihould be attended, if true,
and that, with this degree of evi-
dence, nothing is to be rejeced.

2. That nothing be assigned as a

law of nature, until it be known as
a fat in nature.

In general, it is safer to direcE our

early studies to the investigation of
the laws of nature, than to the as-
fignment of causes. In the latter,
we are more apt to acquiesce in par-
tial representations, hypotheses, or
unconsidered appearances.

3. That fads, uniform as far as

our knowledge of the subjed ex-
tends, be deemed universal laws of
nature refpe&ing such subjed.

4. That partial laws be not ex-

tended beyond the conditions and
limitations under which they are
known to take place.

5. That like phaenomena be re-
ferred to the fame laws.

6. That no proof or explanation
be required of ultimate fads.

SEC T. VII.

Of Moral Philosophy.

LTHOUGH Moral Philofo-

;,_ phy is not the knowledge of
what is, but rather of what ought
to be; yet, before we can ascertain
rules of morality fitted to any parti-
cular nature, the fad relating to that
nature should be known.

Before we can ascertain rules of

morality for mankind, the history
of man's nature, his dispositions, his
specific enjoyments and iufferings,
his condition and future profpeds,
should be known.

From a proper colledion of such

materials, we should be able to as-
certain what is belt for mankind,
and to assign to every particular in
human life its comparative value,
and real place in the estimate of hu-
man affairs.

B This,

This, however, is not to be done

without a fair enumeration of the
articles which men are disposed to
think of importance.

Pneumatics, therefore, or the phy-

fical science of mind, so far as it is to
be collected from human nature, is
the foundation of moral philosophy.

SEC T. VIII.

Of Pneumatics.
P NEUMATICS treat physically

of mind or spirit.

This science consists of two parts.
The first treats of man; the fe-
cond, of God.

That part which treats of man,

may contain the history of man's
nature, and an explanation or theo-
ry of the principal phaenomena of
human life.

That which treats of God, con-

tains

tains the proofs of his existence, at-
tributes, and government.

As the obhervation of particulars

in every subjed, ought to precede
the attempt to establish general rules,
the history of man's nature is the
foundation of every science relating
to him.

This history consists of faCts, of

which some occur on a general view
of the species; others occur to the
individual, in recollecting what passes
in his own mind.

The first may be termed, the hi-

fiory of the pecies; the second, that
of the individual.

In the theory of human nature

are solved questions relating to the
characters of men, to the nature and
future profpeds of the human foul.

Of the form and asped of Mani

T HE human form is eret, fur-

muscles fitted to retain this posture,
and to move it with ease and safety.

The hand and the arm of man is,

am

an instrument and a weapon, not a
prop or support to his body.

His form and posture aie well

fitted to observation, to the .use of
reason, and to the practice of arts.

His aspect is expressive of his

thoughts, sentiments, and intentions.
It is calm or agitated; mild or fierce.;,
languid or ardent; doubtful or de-
cided ; timid or intrepid.

His natural expressions consist of

adtions, gestures, smiles, frowns,
tears, looks, together with changes
of colour;. and exhibit, on the whole,
a variety, and a grace, which either
do not take place, or are not obfer-
ved in other animals.

He is naked- and unarmed; but,

by his invention, qualified to supply
these defects.

The final cause appears to be, that

his talent for invention should be
employed.

iO T H ER animals have their

ranges on the earth, beyond

which they do not willingly stray,.
or beyond which they are not qua-
lified to subsist.

Some subsist only in the hot cli-

mates, others in the cold or the tem-
perate; but man resides equally in
every climate, and can fubfi15 on great
varieties of food, both animal and:
vegetable.

He either accommodates himself

to the inconveniencies of his fitua-
tion, or learns to surmount them.

Va,!rties of the human race.

T' , TNDER the general form and

coniderable varieties of the rice.

Men b-ing dilperfed over the face

of the earth, receive the influences
of cliwiate, lituation, and foil.

The animal and rationil tempe-

ratrent, is comparatively phlegmatic
and dull in cold ciimates; is more
ardent and quick in warm climates;
but has always pol{cftd a diiUn-
guilihed fi.penriority in the tempe-
rate.

Apart. fromn these diftinicions, the

diver!ities of race are marked by a
difference of itature, features, and
comnplexi on.

Mankind may be referred to fix
different races.

It appears from the annual regi-

people are known, that about one

That, of twenty-feven or twenty-
eight, one is born:

That about a'fourth of the whole

number are males between eighteen
and fifty-fix, able to carry arms.

SECT. VI.

Difpoition of Man to society .

A NIMALS have been diftin-
I guifhed into two classes; the
solitary, and the social.

Animals of prey, for the most
part, are solitary.

Eflay on the History of Civil Society,
part i. set:. 3.

Other

Other animals are, for the most
part, associating.

The aflociating may be farther
subdivided into two kinds:

I. Those which assemble in flocks

or herds, merely for company or
safety:

2. Those who unite their labours

for some common purpose, and dif-
tribute the burdens of the commu-
nity according to some rule of in-
flinc' or of reason.

The latter are associating and po-

litical. Maan, though an animal of
prey, and, from necessity or sport,
addicted to hunting or war, is, ne-
verthelefs, in the highest degree, as-
fociating and political.

Societies may be referred to four

general classes: Families, companies,
nations, and empires.

lamilies are united by affetion;

companies by the desire of society;
nations by the desire of security;
and empires by force.

Men,

## SECT. VII. Of Population .

Men, by their confederacy, as

well as by their artifice, are enabled
to subdue every, other species of ani-
mal, to subsist by their spoils, and
to employ the strength of other a-
nimals, though superior to their
own.

Separate societies are, for the most
part, rivals or enemies .

S E C T. VII.

Of Population t.

larger animals.

bers of Mankind. Hume's Populousness of
ancient nations.

C increase,

increase, in others to decrease in
their numbers.

The quick or flow increase of a-

nimals, in general, depends on the
physical laws of propagation, on the
eicurity, and the means of fubfit-
ence the species enjoys.

The first relate to the age at

w:hich the parent becomes prolific;
to the time that elapses in pregnan-
cy; to the frequency of breeding;
to the numbers of each brood; and
to the period during which the pa-
rent continues-prolific.

The laws of propagation deter-

mine the numbers that may spring
from any tingle pair, and the num-
bers of generations that may subsist
together.

These laws, in every species of a-

nimals, are, in favourable circum-
ifances, sufficient to its increase.

Men, in every secure situation,

people up to their resources; and
the aid of government is required,

not

not to improve on the laws of pro-
pagation, but to bestow security and
plenty.

Animals of prey have most diffi-
culty in procuring their food.

Animals-which are made a prey
are leart lecure.

The security and subsistence of

men are most impaired by their
own mutual hostilities and oppref-
sions.

The laws of propagation, as well:

as the means of subsistence, are sup-
posed most favourable to population
in the warmer climates.- To this it
is imputed that nations in those cli-
mates are populous, even under great
defets of government.

Arts and Commerce .

HE materials which men are-

T concerned to provide may be
referred to five general titles, the
means of fqfety, fubfiitence, accom-
modation, and ornament.

These considerations lead to the

praaice of many arts, which are
more or less successful in proportion,
as they are multiplied, separated, and.
complete.

They also fugget the advantages.
of property and- wealth.

The consideration of safety leads

to the invention.of arms, and places
of retreat.

The earliests weapons appear to
have been the club, the fling, and.

G3 the:

the bow: To these succeeded, in
process of time, the. spear and the
sword, joined to the buckler or
shield;

Fire-arms, cannon, and then muf-
ketry.

The desire of retreats has given
rife to the art of fortification.

The art of war, in every age,

must be accommodated to the fpe-
cies.of arms, engines, and methods
of fortification in use.

The arts which men practise for

subsistence are, fishing, hunting, pa-
flurage, and agriculture.

Nations that know least of the

means of subsistence, not finding e-
nough in the fpantaneous growth of
the earth, have recourse to hunting
and fishing.

In the result of these arts, the

hunting-ground, the lake, the river,
or the bay, may be appropriated to
the society; but the game is seldom.
appropriated to the individual.

Nations

Nations that have observed the

method and the advantage of breed-
ing herds, betake themselves to pa-
furage.

They, at first, generally migrate,
or wander with their herds.

The individual acquires an im-

mediate property in cattle, but not
in land.

Nations that are acquainted with

the use of herbs, fruits, and grain,
which do not grow fpontaneoufy,
or do not grow in sufficient quan-
tities, betake themselves to agricul-
ture.

The culture of land, to a certain

degree, may precede property, as it
did among the ancient Germans *,
and among the nations of North
America.

Agriculture, where the obje& is

cap. 22. Charlevoix's History of Canada.

the

the temporary produce of land, is
compatible with migration: Where
the object is the improvement of
foil, and perpetual fertility, agricul-
ture requires settlement, and the pro-
perty of land.

As the property of land excites

to invention in. agriculture, it like-
wife excites to invention in other
arts.

They who have no land, betake

themselves to manufacture, that they
may have wherewith to buy the pro-
duce of land.

By manufacture, men are furnish-.

ed with the means of accommoda-
tion and ornament.

The means of accommodation are;,

cloaths, houses, furniture, utensils,,
equipage.

Men, in different ages, are un--

equally furnished with these arti-
cles; they even fubiift without:
them ; but, in the ruder climates,
under such inconveniencies, as di--

minifli

miniih the numbers of the species,
or prevent their increase.

The means of decoration are such

things as ple.ife the fancy, without
being necessary or useful.

Men, in all ages, are fond of de-

coration; they combine ornament
with the means of subsistence and
accommodation; but they may fuh-
sift, and enjoy every conveniency,
without regard to ornament.

Ornaments are principally made

of rare materials; as gems, precious
metals, &c.

Riches consist in the abundance of

things that conduce to safety, subsist-
ence, accommodation, and ornament.

Riches are the result of arts and
industry.

Whatever ingenuity men exert in

the practice of arts, their success
will depend on a proper diflribu-
tion of their employments, and on
their making a separate business of
each.

In

In making this difiribution, th&

parties trust that they may be able
to exchange what they have to spare
for what they want.

The progress of arts, 'as well as

the casual diflribution of commodi-
ties, depending on situation, climate,
and foii, render commerce expedi-
ent or even neceflary.

Commnerce, in the simplest form,

confiid- of barter, without any stand-
ard of valuation, or medium of ex-
chan-e: Each party gives what he
has to spare of one kind, for what
he wants of another.

To extend trade, money, commu-

nication, and the interposition of
merchants, are required.

The first money, or medium of
exchange, was generally some staple
commodity, a3 corn, cattle, &c.

These were things of uncertain

value, of inconvenient bulk, perish-
ing or expensive in the keeping, and
not easily divided, without making
a change of value.

To:

To avoid these feveral-inconveni-

encies, the-precious metals have been
admitted in every trading. nation as,
the medium of:exchange,

They are, for the: greater conve-

niency, employed in: the form of
coin.

The pound, or other ascertained

weight or quantity of the precious
metals, was employed as the stand-
ard of valuation.

The coin of all nations has under-

gone considerable changes, both in;
refpeLt to fineness and weight.

The present standard for silver in

England is II oz. 2 dw. fine, to
18 dw. allay.

For gold, 22 carats fine, to 2 ca-
rats allay.

The pound of flandard silver is
cut into 62 shillings.:

That of gold, into 42'- guineas.
The pound of silver was original-

ly cut into 20 ihillings: Hence 20
shillings are still the. nominal pound
in -money.

In

In the reign of Edward VI. the

standard of silver was greatly de-
based, and the coin greatly dimi-
nifhed. The standard confited of
three parts of fine to nine of allay;
and the pound of this debased metal
was cut into 72 shillings.

The standard and weight of the

coin have, since the reign of Elifa-
beth, remained the fame.

Operations on the coin embarrass

trade, by perplexing tranfations,
and by alarming the interest of
debtors and creditors.

If, in debasing coin, the interest

of the creditor is not guarded, he
must be defrauded.

In raising the value of the coin,
the debtor would be defrauded.

Most operations on coin have been
of the former kind.

The ute of coin, and actual pay-

ments in money, are not necessary
in every commercial tranfaEtion.

In the transfer of great rums, e-

ven

ven the precious metals would be
cumbersome and inconvenient.

To avoid this inconvenience, the

practice of circulating bills has been
adopted.

This practice is founded in cre-
dit, and tends to extend it.

Commerce employs a number of

separate professions; the manufac-
turer, the facor, the carrier, the
merchant, the retailer.

The price of commodities in trade

is as their scarcity combined with
their demand.

Articles, in the produt!ion of

which, labour, time, and Ikill, are
required, continue to multiply, while
the price is sufficient to maintain
the labourer during the time he is
employed, to reimburfe-his appren-
ticefhip, and other expences, and to
furnish an adequate reward.

When the price fal's below this

The diftindion of personal qua-

lities arise from unequal ilrength
and capacity, unequal knowledge,
resolution, and courage, unlike dif-
positions of benevolence or malice.

These differences constitute either

relations of dependence and power,
or comparative degrees of eftima-

brave, are powerful; the weak, the
ignorant, the fearful, are dependent.

to be more, another lets worthy.

Men differ in their predilection

of qualities confidered as the con-
flituents of excellence.

They prefer qutlities the most

necessary in their own situations,

way.

Of Political' EjiabliJhnments .

HERE men afrociate from'
affedion and choice, and:

with little sense of private or of fe-
parate interest, they have been known
to subsist without rule or political
eftablifhmnent.

Even where they associate from,

a sense of expediency or necessity,
they follow, without rule, the fug-
geftion of every particular occasion.

But in maintaining an union

which has arisen from casual coali-
tions, or force, focicties have been
obliged to adopt, and to submit to,
government.

D 3 Where:

\There the coalition was cafilal,

or forced, individuals felt separate
interefis, and wished for rules to
adjust their pretensions.

Some suffered themselves to be

governed, and others pretended to
government, on the footing of ca-
fual dependency and superiority.

The abuses of casual fubordina-

tion have led men to think of pofi-
tive institutions.

Positive institutions have confirm-

ed, altered, or reftiained, the pow-
ers which arise from casua-l fubordi-
nation.

All the political institutions of

men may be reduced to two general
clafies:

The simple, and the mixed.
Under the simple institutions; the

supreme power is committed to a
single person, or to a lingle aflembly
or body of men.

In mixed institutions, the supreme

authority is exercised by a plurality
of collateral powers.

Simple

Simple institutions are, democra.

cy, aristocracy, monarchy, and de-
fpotifm.

Democracy is the supreme power
of the collecive body.

This institution is calculated .to

corret, or to remove, the effets of
adventitious dependency and sub-
ordination, and to reconcile equali-
ty with order.

Aristocracy is the supreme power
of a particular rank or class of men.

This class of'men has, in some

cafes, been elective; in others, he-
reditary

The inffitution itself, though cal-

eulated to confirm the superiority
of one rank, aand the dependence of
the other, may, notwithstanding,
preserve equality among the mem-
bers of each class.

Monarchy is the supreme power

of a single person, who, placed at
the head of many subordinate dig-
nities, has an authority defined by
laws.

This

This institution is calculated to

confirm adventitious dependency and
subordination.

Extensive and 'perpetual military

arrangements have led to monarchi-
cal subordination.

Despotism is the supreme power

of a tingle person, aflumed and
mintatined by force, on the ruin of
every other pretension to rank.

Despotism has arisen from con-
quell, or military usurpation.

Mixed inflitutions . are, either

mixed republics, or mixed monar-
chies.

In mixed republics, the supreme

power has been -ihared betwixt the
coliective body, and a senate or con-
vention of nobles.

In mixed monarchies, the supreme

power has been shared betwixt a
king and nobles, or. betwixt a king,
nobles, and people..

## SECT. III. Animal Sense and Perception *.

SEC T. III.
An;mal Sense and Perception *.

ENSA rIoN is obtained by means
of corporeal organs; and is,

for the most part, attended by an
original or acquired perception of
iome external cause of the sensation,
or objed of the perception.

The organs of sense are common-
ly reduced to five heads:

Touch, Taste, Smell, Hearing,
and Seeing.

T u c H.

The whole animal fraiie is in
some degree an organ of touch.

The sensations of touch, or feel-
- See Reid's Inquiry inito:the;htirmn mind.

-ing,

ing, are either pleasant, painful, or
indifferent.

'1he interior or subcutaneous parts

are sensible only ro the pains which
alile frotn hurts or disorders.

The final cause appears to be,

that, in their ordinary and found
state, they should require no atten-
tion; but, in cafe of difordeis, that
they should give the alarm.

On the exterior. surface of the

body, harmless sensations are indif-
ferent; but whatever hurts is pain-
ful.

Indifferent sensations are the indi-

cations of the mere contact of inno-
cent bodies.

Painful ienfations are indications.
of hurts or wounds.

P!easant sensations are the sign of

relief from what hurts or wounds;
as of moderate warmth succeeding
to great cold, or the converse.

Many indifferent sensations in
particular parts of the body, as in:

E 2. the

the hands, the tongue, &c. are in-
dications of the intimate properties,
ar.d nice iftlinctdions of bodies; as
of their figure, polish, hardness,
fofrnefs, as well as comparative heat
or cold.

The perceptions of this sense are,

in rome instances, original; in others
acquired.

The figure, hardness, softness,

heat, and cold of bodies, are matter
of original perception.

Many of their salutary or perni-

cious qualities are learned by expe-
rience, and are matter of acquired
perception.

In fbme cafes we perceive the na-

ture, as well as the exiflence of
qualifies; as of figure, hardness,
fofttnlt f.

In others, we perceive the exist-

ence of the quality, but not its na,
ture; as of heat and cold.

I he firfl have been termed pri-

ma;'r, the other Jecondary qualities
of bodits.

The

The sensations by means of which

we perceive primary qualities, are,-
for the moit part, indifferent, and:
have no name.

The sensations by which we per-

ceive seco.ndary qualities are, for the:
most part, either pleasant: or. pain-
ful; are confiiered apart from the
perception they bring; and fre-
.quently usurp the name of the.qua-
lity perceived, so as to. occasion a
considerable ambiguity in language.
Thus heat or cold, which are the'
names of certain unknown proper-
ties in bodies, are sometimes under-
stood of animal .enfation or feeling..

The animal sensation can, in no

cafe, have any .resemblance to the
fulbje& :or,quality perceived.

Its informations, therefore, are

not like :that ;e rec'eive from the
infpeaLion of a picture or image;
but like that we receive by me,,s of
language, or other arbitrary signs.

In original perception,. thee- gn is,

E 3 . c 'affixed.

affixed by nature, and the interpre-
tation inftinaive.

Our sensations are not fitted to

furnish ias with the means of inve-
fligation, and of proof, but with
perceptions which precede all inve-
ftigation or proof.

The feeptic, who affeas to difle-

lieve the informations of sense, has
the fame perception. with the dog-
matift, who professes to believe.

T' A s T .E

The organ of taste is placed in
the tongue and palate;

Its sensations are, for the most

part, either agreeable or disagree-
able.

The qualities of bodies perceived.

by it are-fecondary, as already ex,
plained *.

See 2. 52. &53-

T L..

The sensations of taite become,

after some experience, the indica-
tions or signs of what is pernicious
or salutary in food, &c.

But the fame subjed& is frequent-

ly known by sensations, which dif-
ser greatly in refpeQ: to pleasure or
pain.

The sensation is sometimes plea-

sant, at other times painful or in-
different, while the fame objet is
fill perceived.

Thus, under the influence of ap-

petite, the taste of food is pleasant;
when the appetite is cloyed, the
taste is disgusting or painful; but
the fame species of food is still per-
ceived.

The taste is likewise oft-times in--

different, or is not,. in, any confi-
derable degree, either pleasant or
painful; yet in all those cafes the ob-
jet is perceived, and its qualities
nicely distinguished.

S M E L L,.

S M E L L.

The organ of smell is placed with-

in the nostrils, near to the passage of
the air in respiration.

There is a greater analogy be-

tween ,the sensations of frnell and:
taste, than between those of any o-
ther two of our senses.

They agree in giving a perception:

of secondary qualities; in .enabling
us, by the help of experience, to di-
fiinguifh external fubjeds, and to re-
cognise the fame subjel by the media
of sensations that vary from pleasant.
-to painful or indifferent.

The.organ of hearing is placed in'
she interior part of .the.ear,.

The fenfations.of ifound, w,.hether

combined,,

combined, are either pleasant, pain-
ful, or indifferent.

The quality perceived is fecon-

dary, found, by invefligation, to be
pulses of the air, occasioned by ex-
plosions, or by the tremors of tense
and elastic matter of any fort.

Sounds are diversified by their in-
tensity and musical tone.

Tones being a natural expression

of sentiment, are, by certain com-
binations, easily rendered pathetic.

Different founds are, by experi-

ence, learned to be the signs or in-
dications of different subjeCts, and
of different movements.

The organ of fight is placed in
the eye.

Its sensations are sometimes plea-

sant or painful, but, for the moat
part, indifferent.

Of

Of the qualities perceived by

means of there sensations, some are
primary, others iecondary.

The original perception obtained,

by fight, is that of the visible ap-
pearance of things external. This
appearance includes fuiperficial ex-
t-nlfion and figure, apparent mag-
nitude, colour, illumination, and
ihade.

The acquired perception is that

of the real dimensions, figures, and
distances of bodies,

In the use of this organ, there is
a series of signs and interpretations.

I. The visible appearance is per-
ceived by means of light.

2. Objets are' perceived by the
intervention of this appearance.

The fame object is perceived un-

der great varieties in the visible ap-
pearance.

The solid dimensions of bodies

are understood from the disposition
of light and (hade on the visible fur-
face.

The

The difiances of known bodies

are inferred from their apparent
nagnitude and diftintnefs.

The real magnitudes of bodies at

a known distance, are i:nferred from
their apparent magnitudes.

This discernment of objects from

their visible appearance, is the result
of observation. Where we have no
measure of the distance of bodies, we
cannot, from their apparent magni-
tude, ascertain their real magnitude;
or, where we have no ineafure of
the real magnitudes of bodies, we
cannot, from their apparent magni-
tudes, afcer!ain their distance.

The perceptions of sense are com-
municited to others by information
or teltimony.

Imagination,
IMAGINATION is the flating of

ohjcts as invested with all their L

Imagination is exerted in matters

F which

which we know or believe to le real,
as well as in matters which we in-
vent or believe to be fictitious.

It includes, therefore, all the con.

ceptions in which we endeavour to
specify or particularise our iubje&;
and in this is diftinguifited from ab-
ilradion, in which we endeavour to
generalise.

The hiflcry of our conceptions 's,

perhaps, the molt important article
in the history of the human mind.

We acquire a habit of conceiving

together qualities or circumstances
which are presented together.

Qualities uniformly or generally

presented together in nature, form
our conception of natural fubjeas,
and are the realities on which we
proceed in our conduct.

Occasional coincidences are some-

times conceived as natural and efta-
blifhed combinations,

Combinations of fancy, report, or

vulgar representation, occupy our
conception in the fame manner.

Objects

Objets imagined may be defcri-

bed, may excite sentiment and passion,
and lead our desires and aversions.

Hence imagination is the chief

faculty employed in description, in-
vention, and persuasion, and in tfa-
ting the objects of our choice and
pursuit.

Different nations, ages, and men,

aa under the influence of different
imaginations or conceptions.

Such imaginations, when fortified

by habit, do not give way to realbn
or conviction, and must be fupplan-
ted by other habits.

Objeas are imagined separately or
jointly.

In the separate images of things,

are confidered their real or possible
qualities and circumstances.

In their joint images are confider-

ed their similitude, analogy, or op-
position.

Similitude consists in the likeness
of 'parts.

Analogy confiRs in the similarity
of relation, and proportion of parts.

Opposition confiRs in the contra-

riety of qualities, and proportions or
relations.

Similitude leads to arrangement,
and the classing of objects together.

Analogy leads to the rhetorical

figures of simile, metaphor, and al-
legory.

Opposition leads to diftinaionsy
antithefes, and contrail.

SECT. VII.

Of AbfTratiort.

A BSTRACTION is the flating of
Ja1 qualities and circumstances a-
part from fubjeds, qualities, or cir-
curmfances, to which they are adu-
ally joined in nature.

Thus, in arithmetic and geome-

try, number and quantity are stated
apart from things to be numbered or
measured.

In

In abftra& terms, qualities are
stated apart from their fubjeas.

In mechanics, mrotion is stated a-
part from resistance or friction.

In generic names, qualities in

which individuals agree are stated
apart from those in which they
differ.

Abftraaion is, in a great measure,

arbitrary; hence the various me-
thods of classification followed in,
natural history.

Abftration is the reverse of ima-

gination : It is the foundation of

Penetiation and sagacity are the

SECT. X.

Of Propensity..

E N, like the other animals,
are active, from original-
choice and propensity.

rThey

They delight in freedom and ex-

ercife; they pine under reitraint, or
in the absence of objets fit to excite
them.

The adivity of man's nature con-

sifts in propensity, sentiment, desire,
and Volition.

Propensities have their effet prior
to the experience of pleasure or pain.

They are either animal or ratio-
nal.

The animal propensities are, the

appetites to food, sleep, and the pro-
pagation of the species.

These appetites are periodical or

occasional, and are intermitted when'
their ends are obtained.

The rational propensities lead to

felf-prefervation, to the care of our
children, to the union of the sexes,
to society, and to prefer what is ex-
cellent.

These, like animal appetites, give

a direction to human nature prior
to any experience of their gratifiea-
toans.

But,

But, contrary to the analogy of

animal appetites and gratifications,
they may continue to occupy habi-
tually, without satiety or disgust.

All affecions of kindness are, in
their own nature, pleasant.

All emotions of hatred are painful.
Having rhefe natural propenlities,

we state objets under- the predica,
meats of good or of evil, as they
are supposed conducive or opposite
to the purposes of our propensities.

Whatever is thought conducive to.
preservation, is reckoned good.

Whatever is. thought pernicious,
is reckoned evil.

Whatever promotes the welfare

of society, or of any objea beloved,
is therefore supposed good.

What is pernicious, is supposed
evil.

Whatever is thought, in itself, to

constitute a perfecion or excellence,
is supposed good.

SECT. XI.

Of Sentiment . .
SENTIMENT is a fiate of mind

relative to luppofed good or e-
vil.

Sentiments are pleasant or.painful.
The sentiment arising from a sup-.

posed good attained, is pleasant ;
from a fuppofed-'good miffed or for.
feited, is painful.

A supposed evil avoided, is plea-
sant; incurred, is painful.

The pleasure, in both these cafes,
is termed Joy.

* See Theory of agreeable sentiments.

The

The pain is termed Sorrow, or
Grief.

A supposed good, in expecation

of being gained, is pleasant; in ex-
pedation of being loft, is painful.

The pleasure, in-either of there
two cafes, is termed Hope.

The pain is termed Fear.
Thus all our sentiments or pas-

lions may be referred to four gene-
ral heads:

Joy, Grief, Hope, and Fear.
But there is a great variety in the

sentiments of joy and grief, of hope
and fear, corresponding to the na-
ture of the supposed good or evil,
and of the propensity by which we
are direced towards it.

The sentiments of those who are

occupied chiefly in their own prefer-
vation, are, the sense of safety and
success, or of danger and disappoint-
ment.

The first may comprehend fecu-

rity, exultation, and insolence; the
fe£ond, jealousy, terror, and despair.

The

The most painful sentiments of

those who are occupied chiefly by
their regard to mankind, are alle-
viated by the pleasures of affection,
confidence, and good-will.

The sentiments of those who are

occupied chiefly with the confidera-
tion of excellencies or defeas in
themselves, or in others, are, on the
one hand, respeCting themselves, and
their own absolute perfections or de-
sets, felf-approbation, and eleva-
tion of mind; on-the other hand,
shame, remorse, and dejection.

In refpea to comparative advan-

tages, and superiority to other men,
their sentiments are, exultation, vain-
glory, insolence, and contempt.

The sentiments of men refpeaing

real excellencies in others are, esteem,
respeCt, and veneration.

Esteem is a sentiment of approba-
tion tending to confidence.

Refpeac is a sentiment of appro-
bation tending to fubmiflion.

G Veneration

Veneration is a high degree of
refpe&.

The sentiments of men refpeating

defeLs are, contempt, ridicule, in.
dignation, and rage.

Contempt is a sentiment of dif-

approbation, tending to indifference
dr neglec.

Ridicule is a sentiment of difap-

probation, mixed with mirth or
pleasantry.

Satire and Raillery consist in ex-
posing what is ridiculous.

Buffoonery consists in assuming it.
As the sentiment of disapprobation

predominates, ridicule approaches to
icorn.

As the sentiment of pleasantry pre-

dominates, it approaches to mirth,
and may even be mixed with tender-
ness.

The scornful are rarely susceptible
of admiration or love.

Indignation is a sentiment of dif-
approbation, mixed with resentment.

Rage

Rage is a sentiment of difappro-
bation, mixed with hatred.

The Sentiments of men refpeaing

comparative advantages in others,
differ according as they are disposed
to love or hate, and according as they
fiate the comparison, whether with
themselves or with other men.

The superiority of those they love,

compared to themselves, produces
deference and refpe&.

The superiority of those they hate,

so compared, excites envy; of those
who are indifferent, excites humili-
ation, or is a mortification.

The superiority of those they love,

compared to others, excites exulta-
tion; of those they hate, compared
to others, excites animosity and re-
gret.

Languages may be conceived to

vie with one another in the power
of expressing these varieties of emo-
tion and sentiment.

## SECT. XII. Desire and Aversion.

SECT. XII.

Desire and Averfon.

ES IRE and aversion arise
from our conception of ob-

jeds, founded in experience, fancy,
or report.

Mens desires and aversions are va-

rious, as their opinions or concep-
tions of things.

In proportion as the conception

becomes habitual, the desire or aver-
lion becomes so also.

Certain conceptions of pleasure,

profit, preferment, and worth, pro-
duce fenluality, avarice, emulation,
and greatness of mind.

These desires, though, in some

instances, they carry us far beyond
the ,co.pe of our original propenfi-
ties, have a foundation in some na-
tural propensity, and lead to the ob-
jecs which, in our opinion, tend to
fulfil its purpose.

Sensuality

Sensuality is founded in animal

appetites, and implies a purpose of
enjoyment, even during the inter-
miilons of appetite.

Avarice is founded in the care of

felf-prefervation; but limits it to
the desire of riches, or the means of
subsistence.

Emulation is founded in ambition,

and is the desire of superiority, sup-
posed to consist in preferments and
honours.

Greatness of mind is founded in;

ambition, limited to personal quali-.
ties and real perfecions.

What we habitually desire, we al-

so state as our interest, in judging of
our concern in any matter of choife,

C H A P. I;

General: Observations..

T HE ORIES of mind,. no less
_! than.theories of matter, pro-
ceed'upon the knowledge of phyficar
laws, applicable to explain appear-
ances.

It is admitted, that the intelletual
fytem,; as well as the material, hath

its

its laws; but it is apprehended that
the laws of the intelletual system
are not equally well observed *.

This apprehension comes from our

not confidering the diftindion of
laws, as well as of fubjeEs.

The term law is ambiguous.
It sometimes signifies the unifor-
mity of a fad: in nature.

In this sense it is employed in the-
ories of the material system t.

And in this sense chiefly the ma-
terial system is said to have its laws,

In this sense every law must be

firidly observed; because it is law
only so far as it is observed. Gra-
vitation is a law only so far as bodies
actually gravitate.

But in this sense, too, the intel-
leaual system hath its laws; for, in

* Spirit of laws, book I..

' See Laws of Nature, in the Introduction
to every system of mechanics.

the

the operations of mind, some fads
are uniform.

In this sense, therefore, the laws

of the intelledual lyftem are equal-
ly well observed with those of the
material.

The term law, however, has a

farther signification, and means a
rule of choice, which we delire to
have uniformly observed.

In this sense it is employed by

moralists, civilians, and those who
inftrud the taste in any matter of
elegance or beauty.

In this sense most com.monly it is

mpant, that the intellectual 1yftem
hbth its laws. -

And in this sense the law may

subsist, without being ftridtly obfer-
vel: For it is law in consequence
of its reditude, or of the authority
firm which it proceeds; not in con-
fquence of its being the fad.

But, although the more impor-

tant laws of this fort relate to the
intellecual fyflem, yet there are

laws.

laws of the fame kind relating to the
material system.

Such are the expreflions of what

is required to elegance, beauty, or
utility, in natural fubjeas; or of
what is required to perfection in
works of art.

In such refpe&s, material, as well

as intelletual fubjeCs, may deviate
from the law.

In the vegetable and animal king.

doms, there are deformities, diftor-
tions, and diseases; as there are in
the intellectual kingdom-follies, ab-
furdities, and crimes.

To avoid, as much as poflible,

there ambiguities, laws of the first
fort, whether relating to mind or
matter, have been termed physical
laws; and laws of the second fort,
moral laws *.

Common use will authorise this
interpretation; although the use of

See Introdution.

these

there terms is far from being pre-
cife or determinate: For frequently,
whatever relates to matter, is said to
be physical ; whatever relates to
mind, is said to be moral.

In consequence of this vague use

of the term moral, any theoretical
question relating to mind has been
substituted for moral philosophy;
and speculations of little moment
have supplanted the fludy of what
men ought to be, and of what they
ought to wish, for themselves, tor
their country, and for mankind.

Laws of the UnderJtanding.
rTHE hilftory of the understand-

ing may furnish three princi-
pal rules, or physical laws.

The first relates to the conscious-
ness of ourselves.

The second to the perception of
other things.

The third to the comprehension

of fubjeas of which we are con-
fcious, or which we perceive.

FIRST LAW.

We are conscious of our existence,
operation, and will.

This is the highest measure of e-

vidence, to which no scepticism ever
extended.

SECOND

S EC O ND LA W.

Perception is obtained by the in-

tervention of media, whether like
or unlike to the fubje& perceived.

1. The medium of sensation.
2. The medium of signs.
The sensation by means of which

we naturally perceive the existence
of external fubjeds, has no refem-
blance to those fubjees.

The signs by which we naturally

perceive the exiflence and meaning
of other minds, have no refem-
blance to the things signified.

From this law may be explained

the effects of rites in religion; of
manners, as well as language, in
common life; of title, fortune, and
fashion, as grounds of esteem.

Rites are adopted as the signs of
devotion towards God.

Manners as the signs of our difpo-
fitions towards our fellow.creatures.

H Lan-

Language as the exprefiqon of fen-
time t and will.

Title and fortune are indications
or constituents of superior condition,

Fashion is the form in which fu-
perior-condition is known.

Many signs having no natural

connedtion with the things they in-
dicate, vary in different countries,
and change in the fame country,
without any change of sentiment

Le';dsing the things themselves.

TH I R D LA W.

To comprehend any particular

fuAbjed is to know some general
predicament or class to which it
may be referred.

Thus to comprehend the nature

of any particular being or quality,
is to be able to refer it to some
known species or class.

To comprehend any operation or
phaenomenon, is to be able to refer

it

it to some established or known law
of nature.

Thus we comprehend all the
phaenomena that can be referred to
the laws of gravitation, cohesion,
elecricity, and so forth.

From this law maybe explained

the proceeding of the mind in fci-
ence, in classification, investigation,
and experiment, as well as in its re-
coiirfe to hypothesis and imaginary
system of any fort.

To make a new discovery, is ei-

ther to investigate some law, or to
point out some new application.

Thus Sir lfaac Newton inveftiga-

ted the law of refraction, and applied
it to the rainbow, and to the co-
lours of natural bodies.

Dr Franklin applied the laws of

electricity to lightning, and to the
aurora ,borealis.

The laws of nature are the gene-

ra and species under which parti-
cular fads are ranged, or the pre-
dicaments to which they are referred.

H 2 Some

## SECT. II. Laws of the Will.

Some predicaments have their ge,

neric names in every language, have
been universally admitted, and are
coeval with human thought.

Such are, iubftance, quality, quan-

tity, number, perfection, defed,
good, evil, time, place, &c.

Others are more arbitrary, and

chosen to render human knowledge
methodical and comprehensive.

Such are the classes and'orders in-

to which fubjeas are distributed in
the method of different natural his-
torians.

S E C T. I.

Laws of the Will.
: HE history of the human will

T may furnish the three follow-
ing general rules.

FIRST

FIRST L-A W.

Men are disposed to preserve
themselves.

Hence danger alarms, and safety

is fiudied: The hurtful is shunned-;
the useful is valued.

Under this last title men desire

the means of funbfiftence, 'health,
strength, beauty, parts, temper, re-.
solution, &c.

This is commonly termed'the law

of fEf preservation : but o' great-is
the variety of mens opinions, and
such the caprice of their passions,
that the melancholy and froward
seem to be at variance with them-
selves, and appear to desire what is
deftruaive.

1- 3 SECOIND,

SE C O ND LAW.

Men are. disposed to society.
They not only associate together,

but take- part with their fellow-crea-
tures, and confider general calami-
ties as matter of regret, general
welfare as matter of joy.

This may be termed the law f

society; and is that which qualifies
the individual to be the member of
a community, inclines him to con-
tribute to. the general good,.and en.
titles him to partake in it.

The reality of this law has been
disputed:

I.. Because all the aaions of men
are- not beneficial to.f ciety.

2. Because even.beneficial adions

may be accounted for from other
motives.

The acions of men are regulatedl

not by this law only, but by this
combined with. every other law of
their nature.

T£

If the law of felf-prefervation,

for the most part, prevail, it does
not follow, that the law of society
has no effet.

The external effet, or tendency,

of every law, is diversified in dif-
ferent circumstances..

The general tendency of the law.

of gravitation is, to cause bodies to
approach to each. other; as -the ten-
dency of the. law of society is, to
bring men together, to engage them
in good offices, or to restrain them
from ill ones..

Heavy bodies are not always fall-

ing, nor social natures promoting
the good of society..

Every physical law, nevertheless,

operates to one uniform effec, tho'
with a different appearance.

Thus gravitation operates in pref-

sure towards the earth, whether bodies
be at reft, or in motion, in any di-
recion. When bodies are support-
ed, it weighs on the prop that foip-
ports them. In descending, it ac-

celerates ,

celerates; in ascending, it retards;
in projetion, it turns motion into
a curve.

In the fame manner, what is here

termed the law of society, though
varied in its appearance, is equally
real in its effeds. In minds with6ut
prejudice, it is indiscriminate huma-
nity. In friendship it is beneficence:
In firife it is some degree of re-
ftraint: In good offices it is felf-ap-
probation: In ill offices it is remorse:
Confirms the resolution in one cafe,
and weakens it in the other; so that
even the malicious are confcios-of
its power.

As to the motive from which

aCions beneficial to mankind pro-
ceed, these may ;be various in va-
rious inflances; but no person can
know, except in his own cafe, that
there are no sincere affections of be-
nevolence and good-will.

THIRD;

TH I R D L A W.

Men are disposed to better them-
selves.

They diffinguifh perfeaions from
defedt: they admire and contemn.

This is the great principle of am-

bition in human nature, and may
be termed the law of efimation, or
of progreion: it is an ultimate fa&
in the nature of man, and not to be
explained by any thing that is pre-
vioufly or better known.

Excellency, whether absolute or

comparative, is the supreme obje&
of human desire.

Riches, power; and even pleasure,

are coveted with extreme ardours
only when they are confidered as
the badges of eminence or rank, and
become fubjeas of diftindion and
emulation.

citude about our situation and

it stifles affedion, and leads to the
commission of frauds and of crimes,

:This passion. is comprehended in

the law of felf-prefervation, and is
a partial application of that law,
founded in an opinion of the great
consequence of external advantages.

Opinions, and their consequences,
are more or less prevalent, in pro-

portion

portion to the prevalence of .cir-
cumftances by which men are led to:
entertain such opinions;

For this: reason intereftednefs is
very prevalent.

The opinion on whiih it is found-

ed, arises from the following cir-
cumftances. '

i. The inftinaive care of felf-pre-.
servation.

2. The early prepossession in fa-,

vour of sensual objecs, because they
firit ingrofs our attention.

3. The continued care of eftatei

or fortune that is 'neceflary where.-
ever property is eftablilhed.

4. The rank which riches are

## SECT. II. Theory of Emulation.

The prodigal are commonly most

rapacious, being urged by the de.
fire of enjoyment.

The avaricious are more cautious,
being restrained by the fear of want,

Interest and felfifhnefs are some-

times employed as synonymous
terms: but the sensual, the proud,
the vain-glorious, are not less selfish,
that is to fay, less void of benevo-
lence, than the interested.

And the fault of the interefled,

consists not in the measure of care
bestowed on themselves, but in the
mistake of their own principal con-
cerns.

SECT, II.

- heory of Emulation.
E MULATION appearsin competi.

tions, heart-burning, and itrife,

It arises mostly in the pursuit of
things of mere comparative'value.

Such

Such are, riches, renown, power,
or rank.

The value of riches is compara-

tive; for it consists, not in any ab-
solute meafure.of wealth, but in pof-
fessing more than other men.

Renown consists in being more
talked of than others.

Power consists in being able to

command other men; and rank, in
being of superior station.

They who desire what cannot be

affeced by comparison, such as real
happiness, and real virtue, apart
from the reputation of either, are
not addicted to emulation, enjoy
their own measure of good, and re-
joice in what is possessed by others.

Emulation may be direted to

useful actions, and have effecs ser-
viceable to mankind; but is itself
an unhappy disposition, a source of
envy, jealousy, and malice.

The emulous are not satisfied
with any attainment, while others

I poiffefs

possess an equal, or a superior mea-
sure of the fame advantage.

The characer of the emulous is

not elevation of mind, but a paflion
to be the first in respeCt to those ar-
ticles which the vulgar admire; as
Caesar desired to be the first in a
village, rather than the second at
Rome.

The emulous are enemies to each

other, and to men of superior repu-
tation. They are, for the most part,
vigilant, courageous, and vehement;
indulgent to those iho are consef-
fedly inferior, but malicious to those
who, in point of consideration, are
equal or superior to themselves.

They commonly prefer mean

company, in which they can aflume
a superiority, to better, in which they
must submit to equality.
- Emulation is one effec of ambi-
bition, is comprehended in the law
of estimation, and arises from an o-
pinion, that excellence consists in fu-
periority to other men.

SECT.

## SECT. III. Of Pride.

SEC T. III.

Of Pride.

" RIDE appears in negled, in-
tj attention, contempt, and arro-
gance.

It is founded, therefore, in a mean
opinion of other men.

It is comprehended in the law of
estimation; for it is in consequence
.of this law that men either admire
or contemn.

Pride, or contemptuousness, is in-

consistent withaaffetion, candour, or
any regard to the rights of mankind.

The desire of perfeeion, and even
the love of virtue, have been con-
founded with pride.

This abuse sometimes proceeds

from inattention to propriety of lan-
guage:

Sonetimes from affedation of si-

I 2. gurative:

gurative speech; as when we fay,
cdcenit pride, noble pride, the pride of
adig u. well, &c. Here it implies
contempt; but, in a good sense, the
contempt of what is unworthy.

At other times this confusion of

words is affeced, in order to favour
a system ; as when we would depre-
ciate virtue, or disprove its reality,
by fpeaking-of it in terms -which are
commonly taken in a bad sense *.

Pride results from the law of efti-

mation, as an abuse of it, or an im-
proper contempt of other men.

It is ridiculous to attempt con-

founding the love of virtue with
pride: Their tendencies are opposite.

Virtue is a refped for the rights

of men, and elteem of what tends
to the good of mankind.

Pride is a difrefpea for the rights
of men, and contempt of mankind,

will captivate the attention and ob-
tain the praise of others.

They are ostentatious of what.

they iuppofe constitutes their im-
portance, as of their persons, for-
tune, equipage, talents, and adven-
tures.

They are gratified by admiration,,
without any other evidence of merit.

Vanity is comprehended in the

law of estimation; for it supposes.
the diftintion of admirable and con-
temptible, however misunderstood.

It is the reverse of pride, over-

rating the value of other people's,
opinions, which pride contemns.

The vain are capable of great es-

torts of courage and resolution when
supported- by public opinion, andr
when acing in public view; but,.
without this support, are feeble and
irrelo ute.

The attention they pay to other

men not proceeding from the heart,
but from the desire of consequence
and applause, they always fail where
the fruits or effeds of real. affedioa,
are expeted.

iave probity.,

Probity

Probity implies the love of man--

kind, founded in a temper that is.
compassionate, candid, and liberal.

It is comprehended, therefore, in

Probity may be understood to con-

flitute an excellency, but cannot he
the foundation- of pride or contemp-
tuoufnefs.

It may be underltood to merit ap.

plause, but is dire&ed by- affection,
not by the desire of admiration or
attention.

Men of probity prefer integrity to

any other, kind of supposed excellen-
cy; but frequently have a modest
opinion of their, own merits.

They are perpetually aiming at
the worth they knows and admirei
not referring to it as a standard by
which.to censure others.

SECT. VI.

Of Moral Approbatioui in general.
M O RAL approbation is the

judgment formed of charac-

ters and actions, as being excellent
or just.

It is opposed to disapprobation or
blame.

The apprehension of excellence

or defect, in some inrfances, as of
bea-uty or deformity, in merely ani-
mal or material natures, is accom-
panied with simple emotions of ad-
miration or contempt: But, to every
person, the apprehension of excel-
lence in himself is attended with e-
levation of mind. The apprehen-
lion of defect is attended with shame
or remorke. The fame apprehen-
sions refpeacing other men are at-
tended with complacency,veneration,
love,pity, indignation, and scorn.

Men

Men fond of paradox--have que-

flioned the reality of moral diftinc-
tions: But expreffions-of praise and
blame, in every language, the im-
portance of mens astions to man-
kind, the opposite nature of difpo-
fitions that form the characters of
men, the most vehement sentiments
of the human heart, which refer to
this fubjeCt,-fhow, that the diftinc-
tion of moral good and evil is real,
and universally acknowledged.

In treating of moral approbation,

four questions may be separately
stated.

I. What do men, for the most
part, approve or blame ?

2. By what principle, or confide-

ration, are they directed, in parti-
cular cafes, to bestow their approba-
tion or censure ?

3. What is the proper subject of
approbation or censure ?

4. What is the rule or principle

by which men ought to judge of
moral characters

Thi

The two first quetlions are phyfi-

cal, and belong to this place; the
two last are moral, and their answer
will be comprehended in the first, or
most general laws of morality.

The subjed of morality has been

greatly perplexed by the blending of
these queflions together.

The adual errors and corruptions

of men, have been mustered up as
so many proofs that there is no-
thing which men ought to esteem
or desire.

In physical questions, we attend

to the fad; in moral questions, to
what is good or evil. The sac,
however well established, and how-
ever universal, does not preclude us
from conceiving and choofing what
is better.

If all men were actuated by in-

terest, emulation, pride, or vanity,
it would not follow that probity is
no objec of esteem or desire. When
we are told, therefore, that candour
and benevolence are hypocrisy; that

courage

## SECT. VII. Of the Object of Moral Approbation.

courage is anger; elevation of mind
is pride; and temperance formality
or affedation,-we may ask, whe-
ther these allegations are meant as a
state of the fad, in the pretensions
of some men, or as examples of what
men ought to be ? The fads may
be true; but to choose a pattern con-
feffedly bad, would be abfird.

SECT. VII.

Of the Objet of Moral Approbation.
T H E objec of moral approba-

tion is either some difpoiition

of the mind, or some external ac-
tion.

Probity is the most approved dif-

position; and the external expref-.
sions of probity the most approved
actions.

These conflitute the whole, or the
m.ost essential part of virtue.

Other

tion.

M O/ R A L approbation-is com-
_.IV X prehended in the law of efti-
mation, and is indeed the principal
faa from which we infer the reality
of this law; as the vertical pressure
and fall of bodies are the principal
sacs from which, in mechanics, we
infer the law of gravitation.

It is, therefore, itself an ultimate

sac and principle of nature, not an
appearance to be explained from any
other principle better known.

It has been termed Reason, Con-

science, and Moral Sense; but these
are so many different names, not

different

different explanations of the fame
thing.

As the excellence of human na-

ture consists in certain faculties and
dispositions, these, when possessed,
invigorate the sense of that excel-
lence which they constitute. The
intelligent are confirmed in the e-
fteem of wisdom, and the benevo-
lent in the esteem of probity, by the
concurrence of such charaters in
other men with what they perceive
in themselves.

Every faculty and disposition, in

this manner, has a tendency to ju-
ftify itself.

The vicious affections and desires

of men warp their judgments, and
mar their sentiments of justice.

The emulous and interested are
unwilling to admire what is adverse
to their own designs.

External actions are variously ad-

mired or blamed, as they are vari-
oufly underitood to express different
charaaers and dispositions of mind.

K Thus

Thus men are led by custom in

their judgment of rites and external
observances.

They are led by emulation or in-

terest to affe& the approbation of
:&ions favourable to their own de-
signs.

They are led, by their situations,

to entertain a predelidion for parti-
cular qualities.

Some prefer the military, others
the pacific virtues.

But, so far as the virtue or moral

excellence of a man confilts in such
qualities as fit him to procure the
good of mankind, the benevolent
mufi have a predilection for virtue,
or be specially prepared to admire
that excellence @.

Approbation, at the fame time,

appears to be a specific sentiment in

ture,

ture, which we have termed the
Law of Estimation.

Systems have differed chiefly by

deriving our choice of actions and
characters, some from the law of
felf-prefervation, and others from
the law of society ; but the fad is,
that, if benevolence is understood to
be an attribute of human nature, the
laws of felf-prefervation and of so-
ciety coincide in all their tendencies:
and applications.

Man is, by nature, a member of

society; his safety, and his enjoy-
ment, require that he should be pre-
served what he is by nature; his
perfetion consists in the excellency
or measure of his natural abilities
and dispositions; or, in other words,
it consists in his being an excellent
part of the fyrfem to which he be-
longs: So that the effect to mankind

should be the fame, whether the in-
dividual means to preserve himfelE,
or to preserve his community. With
either intention he must cherifi the
love of mankind, as the most valu-
able part of his charadcer. As this
is the foundation of probity, it is
that which leads men to give to pro.
bity, as such, the preference to eve-
ry other disposition or habit of
mind *.

such exertions in the little sphere of

If successful in any particular in-
fiance, it is no more than an excep-

Our habit of occupying the ima-

brings on a disposition to conceive
every thing under corporeal images,
and even of doubting the existence
of what is not corporeal: But, on re-

The belief which is here assumed
does not imply any adequate notion
of the Supreme Being. Men, for
the most part, have entertained no-
tions on this subjed, unworthy even
of human reason.

But the belief that an artist, or

author, exists, is consistent with mean
and improper notions of his capaci-
ty and intentions.

The belief that Homer compored
the Iliad, is compatible with inade-
quate notions of that poet's genius.

The belief that books read at
school were composed by men, is
consistent with a notion, that even
the claflics were written for the use
of children.

SECT.

## SECT. II. Of the Foundation of this Belief.

SECT. II.

Of the Foundation of this Belief.

lTHE belief of Intelligent Power
ri operating in nature being u-

niverfal, cannot depend on circum-
itances peculiar to any age or nation,
but must be the result of human
nature, or the suggestion of circum-
Jfances that occur in every place and
age.

In the nature of man, there is a

perception of causes from the ap-
pearance of effecs, and of design
from the establishment of order, or
from the concurrence of means to
an end.

Sceptics have not denied the rea-

lity of these perceptions; they have
rather complained of them, as the
foundation of general and vulgar
errors.

But

But our knowledge and belief of

every fort originates in some such
natural perception, as in the per-
ception of matter and its properties;
in the information we take from o-
thers, and in what we underftaid
as the meaning of signs.

In any of these cafes, we can as-
sign no reason for our belief, but
that we are by nature made in one
cafe to perceive existence; in ano-
ther, to accept information; and,
in the third, to understand what is
signified.

No argument is required to prove,
nor can argument have any effect
to refute, where nature has deter-
mined that we hall perceive, be in-
formed, or understand.

No one can refrain perceiving
that the eye was made to fee, the
car to hear; that the wing was
made. for the air, the fin for the wa-
ter, the foot for the ground; and
so forth.

The perception of an end or in-

. L tention

tention in the works of men, im-
plies the belief of an artiit. The
perception of end or intention in
the works of nature, implies the
belief of God.

To acknowledge the perception
of order, is to admit final causes.

In Nature, final causes may be

confidered as the language in whichi
the exifence of God is revealed to
man.

In this language the sign is natu-

ral, and the interpretation inftinc-
tive.

Its accents are heard in every quar-

ter, and its charaEter is written on
everv material to which our know-
ledge extends.

And the numbers of such objecs,

as well as the destination suited to
the nature of each, are proofs of
goodness in the sirs. cause.

2. What their numbers or defti-

nations are, cannot be known to
us; but the order and tendency of
what we know, leads to the belief
of universal good.

The lot of man is mixed, but his

nature likewise is fitted to a mixed
scene.

He complains of evil in his exter-

nal circumitances, or in his own
nature and conduct.

. . . -"
' The

The first subjeC: of complaint is

termed physical evil; the second,
lmoral evil.

Physical evil is the discordance of
things to man's desires.

Without such discordance there
would be no place for aaive exer-
tions.

Complaints, therefore, of phyfi-

cal evil are not proofs of absolute
evil in the works of God, but the
fymproms of an ative nature in,
man properly placed, and having
proper excitements- to exert its
power.

A scene in which there were no
accessions of good to be gained, or,
what is equivalent, no apparent e-
vils to be removed, would be a scene
of inaction, adverse to the nature of
man.

In other words, a being that per-
ceived no evil, or_ had' no want,
could have no principle of ativity.

Man, by being employed as an

active

active power in the order of nature,
is not made to forego his own hap-
piness.

The enjoyments of men are ob-

served to depend not on the mea-
iui'c of external accommodations,
but on the part they at ; not on
their fafcty, but on the degree of
courage they possess; not on vlwhat
they gain for themielves or others,
but on the degree of ardour and as-
section they exert.

Mloral evil is the blemish of

man's nature, ifhlort of what is per-
sect or right ; and what he hinmfelr
reels on this fubjeit is an evidence
that he is not at once what he is
destined to become.

Compilain ts of moral evil are the

iymptoms of a progrefflve or im-
proving nature.

A being that perceived no moral

evil, or no defect, could have no
principle of improvement.

To remove the complaints of mo-

ral

ral evil, it is necessary that men
were either freed from all imperfec-
tions, or rendered insensible of the
imperfetions they have.

The first is impossible: Men must

have the imperfecions of created
nature.

As to the leafi possible measure of

fich imperfecions, we are far from
being able to ascertain it.

For a being to be insensible of
the imperflcions he has, would be
an irretrievable blemish in his nature.

Man's pungent sense of his own

errors and defects, as it is the source
of his complaints against the fyftemn
of things, so it is the source of his
improvements, and is a beauty in
his nature.

He is a voluntary agent, defined

been generally supposed to survive
its reparation from the body, and to

This apprehension is agreeable to

the most rational notions of the

SECT. -V.
Of the Jueftion relating to the Su-

preme, or sole Good.
T HE characers of men are 'vari-

oufly formed upon their predi.

lecion for pleasure, honour, or pro-
fit; and disputes have arisen in the
schools of philosophy concerning the
preference to be given to one or other
of these, in erecting a system.

In stating the object of this con-

troverfy, we may assume, that men
must owe their measure of happiness
either to the gratification of natural
desire; to the quality of their dif-
positions, and the proper exertion,
of their natural powers; or to both
these united.

This assumption will enable us to

comprise every doctrine on the sub-
jea of happiness, under what was
taught by the Epicureans, the Peri-
patetics, or the Stoics.

The

The Epicureans supposed the fu-
preme good to consist in the enjoy-
ment of what we are by nature led
to desire; and, as desire originates
in the sense of pleasure, they con-
tended for pleasure as the supreme
or sole good, and the measure by
which the value of excellence itself
was to be estimated. -

Thinking independence, however,
necessary to the completion of hap-
piness, they supposed the perfec
man capable of enjoying his pleasure
not only in the absence of every ex-
ternal cause, but in the midst of cir-
cumftances of a contrary effet.

The Academy, and, after them,
the Peripatetic School, diflinguilhed
excellence from pleasure, and gave
to the first a superior place in the
scale or estimate of things good.

They observed, that all desire does
not originate in the sense of pleasure.

That there are various propensities
of nature, prior to the experience
of pleasure or pain.

Such

Such are the propensities of every

animal to the use of his organs: The
propensity of man to the use of his
faculties.

The natural affeetion of parents to
their children.

Love and confidence, founded in
sympathy or conceptions of merit.

Ambition and elevation of mind,

founded in the conception of excel-
lence and worth.

They observed, that, to these, or

some of them feparateiy, we are wil-
ling, on many occasions, to sacrifice
every consideration of pleafilre or
profit, and to incur every circum-
flance of pain or loss.

They maintained also, that the

measure of happiness which men
attain, is not to be estimated from
the degree in which they possess or
enjoy the objects of desire; but more
from the part they take, or from the
conduct they hold in this aaive
scene, where so many affairs and
tranfations arise in pursuing the ob-

jeds

jeas of original desire; but where
the conduct of the person ating is
nevertheless the principal confidera-
tion.

In just conduct, the virtue or fu-

preme excellence of a man consists;
and in this also consists the supreme
good to which he ought to aspire.

That, although human life is put
in motion by the spring of certain
original desires, yet, that the motion
itself is of more importance than the
moving power which gave rife to it.

Wisdom is of more value than the
external advantage secured by it.

Benevolence is of more value than
the benefit conferred by it.

And, in general, that, wherever
man is the instrument employed for
the attainment of external ends, the
means are of more value than the end.

They did not, however, venture
to afiert that the end was indifferent,
or that the life of a virtuous man
might be equally happy in adversity
and in prosperity.

N They

They were contented with giving

to virtue the highest place in the
icale of happiness; and they fuppo-
fed it to be so much above that of e-
very other good, whether of pleasure
or profit, that the highest measures
of these were never to be put in
competition with the obligations of
integrity and juflice, even in mat-
ters of the finalleft importance.

The Stoics concurred with the.

Peripatetics in the principal parts of
this argument. They diltingufhhed
between the occasion on which a
man aced, and the action itself
The first might be, and atually was
frequently of a trivial nature, while
the action was of great importance.
This they farther explained, and ur-
ged more forcibly than the Peripa-
tetics had done.

They maintained, that good and

evil consisted altogether in the part
which a man acted, not in the cir-
cumftances in which he was'placed.

In

In their controversy with the Pe-

ripatetics, they laid hold of the con-
cessions made by the latter, in re-
lpec to the preference due to any
consideration of justice before the
highest considerations of pleasure or
profit; and maintained, that it was
absurd to state, under the fame de-
nominations of good and evil, things
in their nature so different, that the
highest consideration of one kind
could not be brought in competition
with theloweft of the other.

That this was not merely in
words, to confound things together,
which ought to be stated apart; but
to countenance hesitation and irre-
solution, when sacrifices of pleasure
or interest were to be made to confL-
derations of justice and duty.

They observed, that, as the people.
are often misled by the inaccuracy
of their own expreflions, it is no
inconsiderable objec of philosophy
to correa this defet, and to teach
menr to call nothing good but that

N. 2. which.

xwhich is to be chosen at all times,
and without any exception whatever,
and not to indulge them in the error
cf confounding, under the fame ap.
peiiations, thi-ngs contingent vith
things which are in their own power,
and for which they are refponiible.

They observed, that it was absurd

in the Peripatctics, w;ho acknow-
ledged the fiupreme excellence of the
virtues, among which magnanimity
and fortitude had a principal place,
nevertheless to suppose that happi-
ners xwould be more complete if there
were no occasion to call forth or to
exercise these virtues.

It appeared absurd to Prate, under

the fame denomination of good, the
wealth which the miser coveted, and
the contempt of that wealth which
the liberal sometimes expressed, and
always maintained when proper.

For there reasons, the Stoics 'imi-

ted the appellations of good and evil
to vtirue and vice alone.

Their system, in. the common ac-

ceptation

ceptation of words, seemed to be
made up of paradox. Pain was no-
evil; pleasure was no good; all ex-
ternal events, whether prosperous or
adverse, were indifferent:. But this,
in their language, meant no more-
than that there was no moral turpi-
tude in pain, no moral excellence in,
pleasure; that virtue might be prac-
tifed equally i- all events,. whether:
prosperous or adverse.

When the occasion did not re--
quire a different choice, pleasure was
to be preferred to pain, and profpe-
rity to .adversity; that, as pleasure
was often, to be rejeted, and pain to,
be embraced, it was absurd to call
that good which it was good to re-
jep, or evil, which it was an evil to
avoid. There was, in the proper or
improper use of what besel us, a real
good or evil; but this good was to
be found in adversity, as well as pro-
iperity, and the evil no iefs in pro-
fperity than in adversity.

Thus we may conceive, that the-

N 3 Epicureans

Epicureans made happiness to consist
in the bbjects of their pursuit, or in
-the enjoyment of them.

That the Stoics placed it in the

proper choice of their pursuits, and
in the integrity and wisdom of their
condu&c; whilst the Peripatetics re-
quired both to complete the idea of
happiness, or the supreme good.

There were other schools, whose

language differed from that of the
sets we have mentioned, but who,
in refpe& to the effest or tendency
of their systems, might be involved
with one or other of these.

In general, it may be affirmed,

that every fee acknowledged the ne-
ceffity of virtue, or allowed, that, in
every well directed pursuit of hap-
piness, the strictest regard to mora-
lity was required. The Stoics alone
maintained that this regard itself
was happiness, or that, to run the
course of an ative, strenuous, wife,
and beneficent mind, was itself the
very good which we ought to pursue.

## SECT. VI. Of the Considerations from which an Estimate may be made of what is most valuable in Human Life.

SECT. Vs.
Of the ConJiderations from which an

EJlimate may be, made of what is
mofi valuable in Human Life.
IT is a maxim allowed in some

instances, that we ought not to

dispute about taftes; but this, in e-
veiy cafe, is certainly not true.

We are by nature qualified to di-

flinguith tates themselves, as worthy
and unworthy, as well as to diftin-
guifi other objects by means of our
taftes.

We think meanly of ourselves for

the pleasures we take, or the.pains
we shun; and we think well of our-
selves for the pleasures we forego, or
the pains we endure.

The feeling of the present mo-

ment, unsupported by experience of
its effects, unjustified by any judg-

ment

ment of its value, and unwarranted
by observation of what paifes in hu-
man life, is a very uncertain, fleet-
ing, and fallacious standard of efi-
mation.

To choose well, we ought to con.

fider not only what is at present a-
greeable, but what occupies the mind
most intensely, what occupies most
continually, and what is the molf
permanent subjed of fatisfafion and
esteem.

By this test the several articles of

reputed good and evil imay be safely
examined and eftinated.

Animal enjoyments are occasional

and transitory; they pall on the
sense, or must wait the returns of
appetite.

They occupy, therefore, but a
finall portion of human life.

Sensuality, or the attempt to ren-

der them continual, impairs the
power of enjoyment, and the facul-
ties of the mind.

Sensuality

Sensuality is a distemper of the

imagination, of which the languors
or difgufls need to be remedied by a
mixture of rational amusements and
pastimes.

The ienfe of animal pleasure seems

deffined to excite to adcion, and to
direCt man to what is salutary, but
not to confsitute the enjoyment of
human life. Bodily pain is occa-
fional, but not always transient.

It appears destined to diredctmen
in ihunning what is pernicious.

It is prolonged to a greater mea-
sure than any bodily pleasure, and
sometimes actually ends only in
death.

Suitably to its final cause, the pain

remains while the attack on animal
life continues; and it increases as
the danger approaches.

In human life, for the most part,

bodily pains are but slightly experi-
enced, and are not the evil which
we have most to fear.

The

The continued enjoyments of men

in human life, arise from their ac-
tive engagemenrts, their affedions,
joys, and hopes.

Their continued sufferings arise

from ill temper, envy, jealousy, ma-
lice, and cowardice.

1Men are belt amused with exer-

cifes that engage them most, that
awaken their affecions, and occupy
their talents.

For this reason the more serious

and urgent occupations are to be
preferred to the more flight and ap-
parently pleasant.

Men of business have more enjoy-
ment than men of dissipation.

The reverse of amusement is in-
occupation and languor.

Affections are pleasant, in propor-

tion as they are ardent, diffused, and
extensive.

Malice is painful, in proportion as

it is diffused, rancorous, and impla-
cable.

Joy

Joy and hope are intense and per-

manent, in proportion as they are
founded in just opinions of things.

False opinions lead to transient joy
and to disappointment.

Grief, and fear, and disappoint-
ment, are most frequent where men
molt mistake the moment or value
of things.

Vehement affedion, aive engage-
ment, or passion, suspend the sense of
bodily pleasure or pain.

Intelletual enjoyments, in gene-

ral, are preferable to the animal, as
they may be rendered-continual, or
occupy the greater part of human
life.

It appears, upon the whole, that
serious engagements, benevolent as-
fetions, and just opinions, are the
preferable source of enjoyments in
human life.

It has been observed, that one of
the frongeft propensities in human
nature is ambition, that which tends

to

to perfection, or the bettering our-
selves.

The phaenomena of this propen-

fity are mixed, its abuses, emulation,
pride, and vanity, are mixed with
moral approbation, magnanimity,
and elevation of mind.

Under the influence of this pro-

penfity, men forego any pleasure, or
incur any pain.

Benevolence, or the love of man-

kind, is the greatest perfection; it
is likewise the source of greatest en-
joyrment.

WVifdom, or a just estimation of

things, is the best security against
disappointment, derpair, and all the
wretched pafflons.

Temperance is the proper. use of
enjoyments of every fort.

Fortitude is an antidote to dejec-

tion and fear, the belt security in
danger, and the best alleviation of
unavoidable sufferings.

The higher animal pleasure is ra-

ted,

ted, the more temperance, or the
proper use of them, muff be valued.

The more bodily pain appears for-
midable, the more fortitude, that e-
nables men, with presence of. mind,
to avoid, or with patience to endure
it, is to be valued.

The greatest defects, as well as
sufferings, of men, are malice and
cowardice, or result from intempe-
rance and folly.

In human nature, therefore, the
most eligible enjoyments, and the
state of least suffering, coincides with
the most excellent slate of the cha-
racter.

Prosperity is acually valued, on
account of its fiuppofed tendency to
constitute enjoyment, or to better
our state.

Health enables us to attain to the
preferable enjoyments and accorm-
plifhments of human life, but is not
an absolute security for either.

The proper use of health is good,
the abuse is evil.

0 Good

Good education is calculated to

promote good dispositions, and to
bestow valuable accomplishments.

Negled has an opposite tendency.
But neither the best nor the worst

education necessarily produce any
precise effe&.

Security or liberty is belt attained

under wife political establishments.
It is the result of justice, and tends
to pro;note the love of mankind.

This effeEQ, and all the proper
uses of liberty, are good.

The abuse is evil.
Thraldom is, in all refpeets, the
reverie of freedom or security.

Competency of fortune is fuffi-

cient to all the purposes of animal
life.

Increase of wealth does not pro-
portionally increase enjoyment.

It often leads to sensuality, diTfl-
pation, sloth, pride, and disdain.

tune; difficulties and dangers call

which his greatef perfecions and

to avail himself of the good, while
it expofgs him likewise to incur the
evil, of which his nature is fufcep.
tible.

The proper use of life is good, the
abuse of it is evil.

The value of prosperity, in gene-

ral, depends on the proper ule of
advantages.

The proper use of things is a per-
fetion of human nature,

0 The

The desire of perfetion, there-

fore, well underftod, appears to be
the furemt guide to enjoyment, and
to all the advantages of prosperity.

All our enjoyments, betides those

of sense, ariie from our having some
pursuit or affetion, to which plea-
sure is not the object, but an accef-
iion. Thus the pleasures of hunting
arise from eagerness to seize the
prey; the pleasures of occupation
arise from the ardour with which
we pursue our objeCt; the pleasures
of ae.Cion arise from the regard we
have for other men; and the plea-
sure of good ations arises from the
citeem of virtue. If plealure be our
sole object, we must forego it in all
those instances.

The measure of good which any

one pofieffes is to be estimated from
his personal character, not fiom his
circumfiances, or external means of
enwj.wment.

In the' different denominations of

good

good and evil, it appears that virtue
and vice are of the greatest moment.

The first is itself the greatest ad-

vantage, the fecureft poffeflion, andi
that which enables men best to em-
ploy all other advantages, and all
other possessions.

The second is wretched in itself,.

and turns every other circumstance
into a curse,.

F ROM the foregoing estimate,

we may venture to affirm, that

the qualities of man's nature are of
more moment than any of the cir-
cumitances in which men are placed,
and that the first concern of a man
is to confider what he himself is,
not how he is situated.

In stating a first principle of mo-

rality, however, it is not necessary
to enumerate all the valuable quali-
ties of human nature; it is sufficient
to felead ome fundamental article,

in itself important, and leading to
the whole.

With these conditions, a principle

will serve our purpose, the better for
being expressed in few words, pro-
vided it bring into view that which
is most essential, and that which is
for ever to be kept in mind.

Under this description, we may

venture to assume, as a first principle
of morality, that the greatest good
competent to man's nature is the
love of mankind.

Benevolence, and the love of
mankind, are terms nearly fynoni-
mous; but we prefer the-latter in
this place, as-excluding pretensions
to merit on account of any sentiment
without an object, and as requiring,
at once, all the efficacy of a good
disposition towards those who are
within its reach.

-H APPINESS is the possession of

the greatest good, or the pof-

fefion of a mind benevolent, wife,
and courageous.

It is a distinction of the personal

qualities of nren, not of their fitua-

The foundation of happiness is a

benevolent affection, ever direted
towards some real objet, but most
intense towards the most worthy,
and most active towards those who
need its aid.

Among its obje&s God is fu-
preme.

This affedion being an aEive

principle, requires or inspires all the
qualities which are requifite:to attain
its end.

Among. these qualities wisdom oc-
cupies the principal place.

An extensive and just under(fand-

ing leads to piety, benevolence, and
candour.

This disposition requires courage

and fcrtitude; for weak minds are
too much occupied with their own
safety to entertain any sincere or vi-
gorous affetion.

It requires temperance; for men

addicted to sensuality or dissipation
are not capable of continued or feri-
ous attachments.

This affeCion, when sincere and

ardent, naturally occupies the mind
to the exclusion of inferior pleasures,
of peifonal anxieties, and fears; and
is therefore a principle of temper-
ance and fortitude.

Universal benevolence, unerring

wisdom, a force and elevation of
mind, which inferior pleasures can-
not seduce; and which blameless sus-
ferings cannot depress.

In giving this definition, we pre-
sent an objed of desire, without at-
tempting to determine in what mea-
sure or degree it has ever existed.

Men conceive perfection, but are
capable only of improvement.

The conception of perfection is a
light to direct their progress.

The object of moral philosophy
is, to afeertain this conception, not
to determine in what degree it is re-
alifed.

The dispositions of men are vari-
ous, and their forces unequal: It is
impossible to ascertain the limits of
their progress.

Human nature fails in the direc-

tion it takes, not in the force with
which every man endeavours to bet-
ter himself.

ambition, take different diretious.

certain the diftindion of moral good
and evil in the description of exter-
nal ations. We muff look for it in
what is characderiftic of human na.
ture, will, intention, and design,
whether benevolent or malicious.

Concerning there, there has been
no diverfity-of judgment.

All mankind are agreed, that be-

nevolence and courage are good,
that malice and cowardice are evil;
and, if it ihould be alledged; that
any number of men are of contrary
opinions, yet every person may, from
his own experience, corret the er-
ror.

The different acceptation of ex-

ternal aCions proceeds from three
different causes:

i. The difference of the cafe.
2. The different choice of the par-

ties who are affeCted by the aCtion ia
question.

3. The different interpetation of

In every cafe, acions are required
as the effeds or expressions of kind-

SECT. XI.

Diference of Interpretation.
TN magny instances, external ac-

tions are, in their own nature,

iadifferent, or of no effect; but are
the established signs and exprefflons
of negleca orattention, of good or
of ill will, or of some affetion or
disposition.

Such are many religious rites in.
every country, and many ceremo-
nies observed in comnion life. E-
ven ations of more consequence are
frequently more regarded on account
of their meaning, than on account
of any other effet.

Ql, The

The ingenuous or malicious mind

is so well known in every age or
country by some determinate course
of life, that the customary acion a-
lone is sufficient to procure approba-
tion or blame: We look no farther
in distinguishing right and wrong;
and, as the peasant is surprised to
hear a language different from his
own, and doubts whether they who
use it possess the fame faculties of
reason with himself; so we are fur-
prifed to be told that men are pleased
with what is offensive, or displeased
with what is agreeable to us, and
doubt whether they have like senti-
ments of morality with us.

But, so 'far as adions are mere

expressions, the choice of them, like
that of words, is perfectly arbitrary;
and nations may differ from each
other in their external observances,
as they do in their speech, without
any inconvenience whatever. One
nation commends what another con-

demns,

lemns, merely because they inter-
pret the fame, or a like adion, dif-
ferently.

The diversities of manners arising

from difference of choice or inter-
pretation, render it difficult to judge
·of the merits or personal qualities of
men, in ages or nations remote from
our own.-

The vulgar are able to interpret
only the manners of their own con-
dition and country; they common-
ly mistake those of a different rank,
or of foreigners.

There is, in saC, nothing in ex-
ternal manners which opinion may
not render agreeable or disagreeable;
and the opinion of one country is
not the rule or fandard by which to
judge of the manners of another.

The definitions of crimes vary in

the law of different countries.; be-
cause different overt ads are specified.
as the marks of guilt.

their precise equivalent in different
languages ; because men combine
varicufly, under different terms, the
circumrnances from which they infer
merit or demerit.

This is confilent with a perfet

agreement of opinion concerning
any particular circumrtance apart,
as well as, in general, concerning
what is good or evil, in the difpofi-
tions of men.

CHAP. II.
Of the Rights of Men in general.

Right is such a relation of the
person to a thing, that no

alteration ought to be made in it
without his own consent.

The term ought, in this definition,
implies a sentiment of moral obliga-
tion.

Things are the constituents of the
person, or the constituents of a per-
son's state.

A regard to the rights of men is
comprehended in the law of self-
preservation, combined with the law
of society; or, in other words,
this sentiment of right is inseparable
from our disposition to preserve our-
selves, and our fellow-creatures.

Wrong is a violation of right. The
moral sentiment arising from a sense

of

of wrong in our own cafe is exafpe-
rated by resentment; in that of o-
others, is indignation, conceived on
the perception of guilt in one, and
of suffering in another.

No one can have a right to what
is not possible, or not real.

The right of one man to any gi-

ven thing, excludes the claim of an-
other to the fame thing.

The right acquired to the fruits

right all men have to the u.se of their

Prior to convention, men do not

acquire rights by the obiervance of
any form or ceremony that is of no,

7'he Obligations of Contrat.
A Contrad is the engagement of

parties to perform what is
supposed to be in their power.

Engagements are made by pro-
mises.

Men, by nature, rely on the per-
formance of promises.

The objea of a promise or en-

gagement becomes, to the person
accepting of that promise, part of his
fiate; breach of faith is an injury,
and he is entitled to repel it by force.

Here the compulsory law of Na-

ture, which, in its original form, is
prohibitory, or negative, becomes,

in appearance, positive, requiring
some aaual performance; but the
objea of law is nevertheless a mere
prevention of that wrong, which a
breach of faith would constitute.

SECT. II

Laws of Contraxt in general.
I. r HE source of conventional

a obligation, is the right of

one party to exaa a performance
upon which another has made him
rely. i

2. Contraits, therefore, create
right only to what depends on the
will of contracing parties.

3. To constitute a contraS, mu-
tual promises, or a promise and ac-
ceptance, are necessary between par-
ties, aading freely, and possessed of
the use of their reason.

Although one party has. promised,
if the other has not accepted, the last

cannot

cannot pretend to have an expeca-
tion raised.
-But mutual promise implies ac-
ceptance.

Men who are known to-be under

restraint or insanity, cannot raise any
reasonable expectation.

4. A party may stipulate in per-

son, or by his agent or messenger,
in words, at-ions, or signs, that are
understood.

5. A person is bound by the fli-

pulations of a servant or messenger,
to whom he has given credentials,
or whom he has authorised by fuffi-
cient acknowledgements of his trust.

6. Words are to be interpreted in

their most ordinary sense, or in the
sense in which it appears from other
signs that they were intended to be
used.

7. An ation of any kind, per-

formed with a view to raise expec-
tation, or by which it is known
that expecations are naturally rai-

fed,

fed, is sufficient to constitute a con-
trad.

8. Cuflom is a reasonable ground
of expectation; and therefore is
binding on all parties.

Great part of the civil conven-
tions of men, are conflituted by the
received customs of their country.

A pradice introduced by force
may become a legal cuflom: for
being such as men are reconcileable
to, after they are reconciled, and
continue to observe it voluntarily,
it becomes a matter of convention.

But pradifes, or sufferings, to
which men are not reconcileable,
and with which they are made to
comply by force, are usurpations,
and never can, on the foot of con-
fuetude, be confidered as matter of
convention.

SECT. IV.
Of the Exceptions to ContraCss in ge,

lneral.
~A NY promise given is rendered

void, by the exceptions of

force, fraud, injustice, or impofli-
bility.

FIRST EXCEPTION.

Fcrce is constituted by aóual vio-

lence, or menaces, employed by the
accepting party.

This exception is valid.
i. Because a person extorting a

promise by force, cannot have a
reasonable expectation of its per-
formance being intended.

2. Because the party offering

force commits an injury; and in-
stead of acquiring a right, may be

S 2 pre-

prevented, repelled, or obliged to
make reparation.

A. B. This exception does not

extend to the cafe of contracts en-
tered into with one party, on ac-
count of the violence offered by an-
other.

Nor is this exception admitted by

the pracice of nations in the cafe
of any surrender at war, or military
capitulation.

SECOND EXCEPTION.

Fraud is constituted by the deceit

which a party employs to obtain a
promise.

This exception is valid,
I. Because a party who is known

to be deceived concerning what he
promises, cannot raise an expedca-
tion that he will perform when un-
deceived.

2. Because deceit, or imposition,

15

is an injury, and gives a title to re-
paration.

N. B.. This exception does not

invalidate the promise made to an
innocent party in consequence of the
misinformation of another.

Nor does it invalidate any milita-
ry capitulation,. though obtained by
stratagem,.

THIRD EXCEPTION.

Injustice consists in the wrong
which a third party would susser
from the performance of a contrat.

There are four different cafes in.

which this exception may be offer-
ed:

Cafe i. When neither of the con-
trading parties was aware. of the
wrong.

In this cafe the contrac is simply:
void.

Cafe 2. When only the party ac-
cepting was aware of the wrong.

S 3 Iv.

In this cafe, the contrac is void;

and the party accepting has com-
mitted an injury againit the party
promising, as well as- against the
third party, who, if' the 'ontract
had taken effe&, was likely to have
suffered.

Cafe 3. When only the party pro-
mifing was aware of the wrong.

If he promised with intention to

perform, he is injurious to the third
party concerned.

If he promised with intention to

plead the exception, he is injurious
to the party accepting.

Cafe 4. When both parties were
aware of the inj-ustice.

Both are injurious to the third.
party concerned..

FOURTH EXCEPTION.

Impossibility extends to every cafe

r..at cannot, in the nature of things,
:ake place; to every article that ex-

ceeds

ceeds the power, or that does not
depend on the will, of the parties.

This exception, like. the former,
may be offered in four cafes.

Cafe i. When neither contra&d
ing party was aware of the impolfi-
bility;

The contraa is simply void..
Cafe 2. When only the party ac-
cepting was aware of the impoffibi-
lity.-

This conduc is either irrational,
or may be injurious to the party
promising, by drawing him into
snares and fruitless attempts.

Cafe 3. When only the party pro-
mifing was aware of the impoffi-
bility. -.

It is injurious to the accepting
party, by creating vain expecations.

The 4th cafe, Supposing both
parties aware of the impossibility,.
i-altogether irrational and absurd..

Exceptions peculiar to Conditional and

A LL conditional contracs are

void, if the condition has fail-

ed, or is found to be unjust or im-
possible.

T'he condition may be a mere

contingency, or it may depend on
the will of either party.

If a contingency, the parties may

be allowed to interpose, as they do
in games of ikill and dexterity.

Or they may not be allowed to
interpose, as in games of chance.

If the condition depend on the

will of the party promising, he be-.
comes bound to petiorm one acion,
only, in consequence of having per-
formed another.

If

If it depend on the will of the
accepting party, he acquires a right
only in cafe of having performed
his condition.

In mutual contracts, a party fail-

ing on his part, has no title to ex-
act performance on the other part.

Property may be transferred by

A conveyance confifis of consent
and delivery.

A party who has obtained con-

sent without delivery, may defend,
or occupy, the fubje&, in right of
the former proprietor, not in his
own.

Hence it is argued, that the mere

content of a party deceased, with-
out delivery, cannot convey pro-
perty; because the party deceased
having no right, the subjea falls to
the first occupier.

Of the Right to Command.
rT H E right to command is ac-

The contract between the marser
and hired servant is a reciprocal
contrac.

The terms are such as they mu-
tually fiipulate, or such as -known
cuftcms eftabliih.

The civil contract or convention
between the magistrate and subject,
or sovereign and people, is likewise
reciprocal.

The terms are such as the par-
ties stipulate in express charters and
tatutes, or such as. may be afcer-
tained from known culloms.

The social cumpacd, from which,
accordii:g to some writers, all the
mutuar duties of men in society are

T derived,

derived, is a mere fition in theory,
resembling the fiction in law, by
which a plea which arises from one
source, is sustained as coming frea
another.

Thus mutual pleas of. guardian

and ward, which arose from equi-
ty, were fulfained in the Roman
law as arising from contract.

There never was in reality any

contra& prior to the e'tablilhment
of society. Cufioms, charters, and
statutes, which constitute or express
the civil conventions of men, are
all poterior to the eflablifhment of
ibciety.

Ficions of law may be conve-

nient in. arranging civil acions,
but are of no use in explaining the
laws of nature; for by the law of
nature, every right, and every obli-
gation, is admitted only where it is
real, and can receive no confirma-
tion from any fiction whatever.

Thie original rights of men, foun-

ded

ded in humanity, and in the title of
every person to defend himself, are

The obligation to abstain from breach

in the more general obligation to ab-

A right to command is sometimes
acquired by forfeiture, when a per-
son who has done a wrong, becomes
bound to repair it by his services.

Y the maxims of compulsory

occasion, maintain his right: But
from considerations of duty, .he is,
on many occasions, obliged to fore-
go it.

A person is more concerned to

maintain and to exercise the assec-
tions of a beneficent mind, than he
is to preserve his condition in any
other refpea.

The conventional laws of society,

in some instances, as well as the law
of humanity, admit, that the ex-.

CHAP. I.

Of the S$anfions of Duty in general.
A LAW of duty is an expression

of what a person ought to do

from choice; and in doing which,
he is said to have merit; or in doing
the contrary, to have demerit.

The first application of the fun-

damiental law of morality is prohi-
bitory, forbidding the commission
of wrongs.

U 2 The

The second is positive, requiring

every external effec of virtue, or
of cdcl-Y ill to mankind.

Bout as of good-will or benefi-
cence cannot be extorted by force.

The objec of comlpulfory law, is

the preservation of parties exposed
to v rongs; who, in defending them-
leiivs, may, even by force, oblige
others to desist from injuries.

The olbje& of morality, in what

relates to the duties of men, is the
virtue of those who aca.

Compulsion would' alienate the as-
rections of men.

Favours extorted by force would
be robberies.

WThoever employs deception or

force, except in his own defence,
or in that of his fellow-creatures,
commits an injury.

The fanaions of duty, are those

of religion, of public repute, and of
conscience,

CH A P.

CHAP. II.

Of the SanStion of Religion.

R ELIGION is the sentiment of
J.' the mind relating to God.

The fanaion of religion is its
tendency to influence mens condua.

This tendency is of two kinds.
The first is, to make men love

wisdom and beneficence, as being
the charaderiftics of the Supreme
Being, whom they adore; and to
make them love their situations and
their duties, as being appointed by
Providence.

The second is, to make them hope

for rewards, and to fear punish-
ments.

The religious doctrine of rewards

and punishments is a species of com-
pulfory law, extending to all the
thoughts and inclinations, as well as
the actions of men.

U3 This

This law, in all its extent, can be

safely applied by every person only
to himself.

When magistrates think them-
:~, selves armed with the fantion of

-rreligion, and entitled to restrain
;'-- thoughts as well as ations, they

attempt what is placed beyond the.
reach of their power.

Superstition, or the abuse of reli-

gon, has been accompanied with
vey fatal effets:

With a misapplication of moral

efleem, and the substitution of fri-
volous rites for moral duties; with
cruel animofities of party, and a
false apprehension of fandity in any
ads of injustice and horror that pro-
ceed from a supposed religious zeal.

CHAP. IlI

.he Sanitions of Public Repute.

THESE fan&ions include the in-
T fluence of prevailing opinions
and examples, together with the
commendations and censures men
bestow on the acions that please or
offend them.

The influence of prevailing opi-
nions and examples, arises from the
social nature of man; and is one
condition by which men are fitted to
adt in companies and societies.

The tendency of this influence is
good or evil, according to the na-
ture of the opinions or examples
that prevail.

Nothing distinguishes men of a
happy nature more than that force
with which they are Sometimes able
to correct false opinions, and with

which

which they are always able to rcfift
their contagion.

It is part in the social nature of

man, to desire praise, and to shun
blame.

This puts it in the power of every

person to reward adions agreeable,
and to punish asions disagreeable
to himself: But as commendation
and censure are frequently ill diftri-
buted, it is a great weakness to be
guided chiefly by such confidera-
tion s,

CHAP. IV.

Of the San7tions of Conscience.

THIS fanEtion is constituted by
T the satisfaction men have in
doing right, and the ihame or re-
morse which arises from having done
wrong.

Men being desirous of personal

excellencies, and averse to personal
defets, have fatisfaaion in actions
that tend to the purposes of virtue.

They feel remorse or shame for ac-
tions that tend to the purposes of vice.

The sentiments of conscience are

frequently blended with those of fu-
perflition or custom, and, like them,
are subjea: to error.

It is the object of cafuiftry-to pre-

vent, or to correa such errors, by
pointing out the real tendencies of
virtue and of vice in external aEtions.

Those that conflitute beneficence,

are required under the fandions of
duty only.

Prudence is that discernment by

which men distinguish the value of
ends, and the fitness of means to
obtain them.

Without this qualification, men

are not fitted to ad with any mea-
sure of steadiness, consistency, or
good effect.

renmperance is abstinence from in-

ferior pleasures or amusements that
mislead our pursuits.

No one can apply himself effec-

tually to any worthy purpose, who
is liable to the interruption of mean
pleasures or amusements, that oc-
cupy an improper part of his time,
that fifle his affetions, or impair
his faculties.

The maxim of temperance is,

tained what his best and happiest
engagements are, ought to count e-
very moment loft, that, without ne-
ceflity, is otherwise employed.

Fortitude is the power to with-

fland opposition, difficulty, and dan-
ger.

All the good'qualities of men

have a reference to foine effete that
is to be produced, and have a merit
proportioned to foine difficulty that
is overcome. Hence dispositions
and capacities of any fort are of no
avail, without resolution, and force
of mind.

SECT. II.

Of Duties referred to Probity or Ju-

ftice.

TUTIES referred to probity, are

. either private or public.

THE private duties are, I.nocence,
Candour, Piety, Frienalijij, G(ra-

X ti (.:,e

tiaude, Liberality, Charity, Cihvility,
and Politeness.

Iinocence has been observed to be

the cbjet of compulsory law, and
is the molt indispensable charaderi-
ftic of probity.

It implies, beside other effects,

Veracity and Faithfulness : the first
-cppcfid to deceit; the second, to
perfidy.

Caindur is the just allowance gi-
'ven to tie pretensions or merits of
other men, in opposition to preju-
dice, or to the fuggeflions of inte-
reft.

Piety is the exercise of venera-

tion and love; first, towards God;
next, towards thofe'who by nature
or choice are proper objecs of our
refpea and affection.

'I he expressions of piety to God
are either fixed or arbitrary.

Its fixed expressions are ads of
beneficence, which concur with the

pro-

providence of God in promoting
the good of his creatures.

Its arbitrary expressions are the

different rites eflablithed in different
countries.

Friend iJhip is the beneficence of
private parties, proceeding from
motives of particular esteem and at-
tach mernt.

This includes the reciprocal du-

ties of parent and child, of husband
and wife, and of all other private
relations.

The duties of the parent are, to
maintain, to proteet, to educate, his
child; and, as far as he is able, to
eftab.lilh and to secure his state or
condition.

The duties of the child are, obe-
bedience, deference, and gratitude.

Many of the duties of husband
and wife are conventional; and, as
such, are matter of ftri&d law; but
the observance of them must pro-
ceed from the heart.

X Con-

Consanguinity is a natural tie.

The fortunes of men are colnmon-
ly involved in those of their fami-
lv; and relations are, on account of
this ccnnedtion, among the firlt or
nearef cbjeds of beneficence.

Gratitude is the return made for
favours received.

Men cf probity are neither un-

grate'ul, nor jealous of ingratitude
in others.

To require a base action under

the title of gratitude, is to forfeit
the title of benefacdor.

'I he returns due from the grate-

ful, cannot be ascertained by any
precise nmeafure, nor can they be
exacted by force.

T'il intenrion of the benefador

is more to be regarded, than the
*v-ie cf his benefit.

c uld .i- exaced by force, it would

diiiiiguiifcd from fees, nor the es-

feds of gratitude from those of con-
ftraint.

The ingratitude of mankind is:
sometimes alledged as an excuse for
negleting good offices; but it is
the business of a man to perform
his own part, not to answer for-the
returns which others may, or may
not, be disposed to make.

Liberality is the free communi-

cation of what is ours, to oblige o-
thers.

Charity is the free communicatior

of what is ours, to relieve the dif-
tressed.

Undiftinguifhing charity is per-
nicious in trading nations.

It is a wife maxim in trading na-

tions, That no person able 'to earn
his bread fihould be maintained. gra-
tuitoufly.

But charity to those who have no

bread, and are unable to earn any,
is a duty of the strongest obligation,.
and a very important objec of pu-
blic concern.

X 3 Civilty

Civility is a guarded behaviour in

the ordinary intercourse of society,
to avoid giving offence.

Politeness is a behaviour intended
to please, or to oblige.

Civility and politeness are com-

prehended in the general character
of good breeding.

To be well bred, a man muff

posiess discernment, candour, and
good will; at least a sincere aver-
sion to offend. The effects of as-
sedation or design are easily diftin-
guifhed.

Ill-bred men sometimes assed

great politeness, but they Ihock
and mortify those they pretend to
oblige.

Flattery, excessive or insincere
profeflions, are vicious.

The sentiments of the heart some-

times evaporate in words; and great
professions are,. even without any
intention to deceive, put in place of
benefits.

THE public duties.of probity are,

Allegiance on the part of the subject,
ProtecTion on the part of the magi-

The Allegiance of the fubje&, is

SEC T. III.

Duties referred to Prudence.
IT is the obje& of prudence, to

dire& a man in what he is to

wish for himself, for his friend, for
his country, and for mankind.

In this sense, prudence is the

guide or diretory in every duty:
But, in its more limited acceptation,
it refers more particularly to the
duties which assea a man's state or
condition.

These duties may be referred to

the following heads: Decency, Pro-
priety, ModeJfy, Oeconomy, Decision,.
and Caution.

Decency is the agreeableness of a

person's appearance and carriage to
the sense and opinion of other men.

The rules of decency are prohi-
bitory, and forbid whatever would

offend,

offend, in nudity, filth, or obfceni-
ty.

Propriety is the fiitablenefs of a

person's behaviour to his nature,
his age, his fiation, and rank.

'['here is in all the external effects

of virtue, as being suitable to man's
nature, a propriety that may be
confidered apart from their other
recommnendations.

Diffidence, and a cautious ap-

proach to the manners and preten-
sions of manhood, are proper to
youth.

RefolNtion is proper to manhood.
CalmncJis and Deliberation to age.
Dignity- and ReJerve, without
contenprtioufnefs or petulance, are
proper to men of high fiation.

Deference, without tervility, is
proper to men of inferior rank.

Modefly is a proper reserve on e-
very filujed of lelf-eflimation.

It forbids ostentation of what we

poffl's, of what we have done, or
of what we have iuffered.

Oeconlowiy

Oeco1nomiv is the proper adjuftient
of a person's expence to his fortune.

TWhere fortune confiitutes rank

and power, oeconomy is required
to preserve independence and free-
dom.

Sensuality and gaming are ad-
verse to good oeconolny.

Decision is a seasonable and refo-

lute choice of what a person ought
to do.

In some cafes, hesitation is equal

to a total purpose of inacion. E-
very opportunity is loft, and every
measure comes too late.

Caution consists in a proper atten-

tion to all the difficulties that may
occur in what a person undertakes.

The great objeds of caution are,

not to engage in what is above our
strength, nor to commit ourselves
to persons that mislead or deceive.

The immoderate use of intoxica-

THE rules of casuistry cannot

Attempts to give casuistry this

the attention, from qualities of the
heart, to matters of form.

Good disposition is necessary to

the happiness of mankind; and du-
tiful conduc naturally results from
good disposition.

It is however of moment to anti-

cipate, in general rules, the external
ffeets of virtue.

These rules render the defcrip-

dion of virtue itself more particular,
and more complete. Being. sup-
ported by the fanlions of religion,
and of public repute, the rules of
duty may procure to society the be-
nefit of useful aaions, even where
they do not procure to the person

Of Merit and Demerit.
A CTIONS are said to have merit

or demerit, according to the

nature and degree of the moral qua-
lity they bear.

Acions that express good-will to

mankind in the highest degree, have
the highest merit..

Hence beneficent aEtions per-

formed in the face of dangers, dif-
ficulties, and personal sufferings,
are allowed to have the highest me-
rit.

Actions that proceed from malice,

and give examples of mischiefs done
without inducement or provocation,
are of the highest demerit.

We express our sense of demerit

in the different degrees of crimes,
offences, and faults.

Y2 A

A crime is an injury done from

malice, jealousy, revenge, avarice,
or tome other passion that sets man-
kind at variance.

An offence is a wrong done in

the gratification of some passion in
its own nature consistent with ami-
ty.

A fault is a wrong done from in-
attention or ignorance.

Faults of inattention are culpa-

ble in proportion to the moment
and importance of the fubje,.

Faults of ignorance are more or

less culpable, as the defec of know.
ledge argues negled and inatten-
tion.

It is a general maxim, That ig-

Introduation.
IT appears from the history of

mankind, that men have always

aaed in troops and companies; that
they have apprehended a good of
the community, as well as of the
individual; that while they prac-
tife arts, each for his own prefer-
vation, they institute political forms,

Y 3 . and

and unite their forces, for common
safety.

It may be proved, that most of

the opinions, habits, and pursuits,
of men, result from the state of
their society; that men are happy
in proportion as they love man.
kind; that their rights and their
duties are relative to each other;
and, therefore, that their most im.
portant concerns are to be found in
their mutual relations, and in the
slate of their communities.

One great department, therefore,

in which the love of mankind may
operate most effectually, yet re-
mains to be confidered in the policy
or eftablifliment of nations.

A nation is any independent

company or society of men aaing
under a common diretion.

The united force of numbers, and'

the direcion under which they aC,
is termed theJfate.

Nations are happy who are com-
posed of happy men.

Nations

Nations are wretched who are
composed of unhappy men.

Nations may be confidered in re-

sped to their resources, or in refpea
to their institutions.

National resources are the objeas
of public oeconomy.

National institutions are the ob-
jeas of political law.

very article that tends to con-

that may be employed for its prefer-
vation.

Such articles may be referred to

threeprincipalheads; People,Wealth,.
and Revenue.

Some of there have been already

confidered, in refped to the faCd, or
in refped to the course which man-
kind actually hold in the treatment
of them.

They are now to be confidered in

T H E value of numbers is pro-

portioned to their union and
characer.

Numbers without union or virtue,
do not constitute strength.

A people, in consequence of their

numbers, Sometimes become difun-
ited and corrupted.

If they inhabit a large and exten-

five territory, they are disunited, and
lose fight of their community. A
few ingrofs the management of pu-
blic affairs, and with-hold from the
many every subjea of public zeal,
or political occupation. The greater
part are thrown into a state of lan-
guor and obscurity, and susser them-
selves to become a prey to those who
are prepared to invade their rights.

Human nature, in flates of a

moderate

moderate extent, has prospered and
excelled ; but in fates overgrown,
has generally declined and degene-
rated.

If great numbers be crouded into

narrow diftrits, or cities, they are
exposed to corruption, become pro-
fligate, licentious, Seditious, and in-
capable of government or public as-
sections.

The union of a people depends on

the arrangements or dispositions made
to employ them where the public
service requires.

The union of the people in repu-

blics, arises more from their assec-
tion to the community, than from
the power eftabliihed to enforce their
services.

In monarchies, it arises from the

love of personal dignities, to which
individuals aspire in serving the state.

In despotism, it arises entirely

from the power that is prepared to
enforce the services of the people.

The

The characer of a people, confi-

dered as a national resource, is to be
estimated from their fitness to reap,
and to preserve, or to improve the
advantages of their contfitution, and
to support their country in pursuit
of its objeds.

Different characters are required

under different forms of govern-
ment.

Under republics of every fort,

high degrees of probity are requi-
red; under monarchy, less; and un-
der despotism, least of all.

The principal objeds in every

state, next to the political conftitu-
tion, are defence and commerce.

In respeCt to defence, men are to

be estimated by their hardiness, cou-
rage, and discipline.

In refpe& to commerce, men are

to be estimated by their induitry,
and by their skill in profitable arts.

Commercial nations may value ac-
cessions of art, as the surest mieans

of gaining accessions of people; for,
in circumfiances otherwise favour-
able, population keeps pace with the
arts, and means of subsistence.

Institutions that, by securing pro-

perty, and by preventing oppression,
encourage the settlement of families,
and facilitate the rearing of children,
are the most favourable to popula-
tion.

S E C T. III.

Of Riches or Wealth.
~M EN are supposed rich in pof-

fessing the means of defence,

subsistence, accommodation, and or-
nament.

Wealth is a national resource, be-

cause it may be employed in main-
taining useful or serviceable men,
and in supplying the exigencies of
Rlate. -

The contituents of wealth may

be

be confidered in refpe& to tihir va-
lue, and in re{pe&t to their price.

As the use of wealth is to main-

tain and accommodate men, articles
or commodities are valuable in pro-
portion to the numbers they are fit
to maintain and accommodate.

The means of fubfiltence are ne-
ceffary.

The means of accommodation

which contribute to the preservation
of men, and to the increase of their
vigour and health, are next in value
to the necefliries of.life.

But articles of mere ornament are
of no value at all.

The luxury of a people is to be

estimated fro n their consumption of
mere ornaments.

'Ihe price of a commodity is mea- v

fured by the quantity of any other
commodity that is commonly or oc-
cafionaily given in exchange for it.

Price is molt commonly expressed,
and paid, in money.

Z Hence

Hence money is confidered as the

equivalent of all commodities, and
the constituent of wealth.

But commodities are no less the

equivalents of money; and abun-
dance in any one species, whether
of money or other commodity, will
buy a participation in the whole.

The price of commodities fluctu-

ates, and keeps pace with the quan-
tity of money in circulation, with
the scarcity of the commodity, with
the demand, and with the riches of
those who consume it.
i Articles of ornament are frequent-
ly of the greatest price.

Commodities that are the work of

labour, time, and skill, cannot con-
tinue to be fold for less than will
maintain the workman, and pay the
whole of his advance.

As the value of commodities is

measured by the numbers they may
maintain, so the cofi of a commo-

dity

dity may be estimated by the num-
bers and time employed in produ-
cing it.

The wealth of any country is pro-

portioned to its natural advantages,
to the indufiry and ikill of its inha-
bitants, and to the profit of its trade.

Natural advantages are, good cli-

mate, fertile foil, and useful mate-
rials.

Indufliy and skill comprehend all

useful arts, agriculture, and manu-
faaure, in all their branches.

The profit of trade is the profit

either of the consumer, of the produ-
cer, of the merchant, or of the fate.

The profit of the confiumer con-

sifts in being supplied with neceflary
or useful commodities;

The profit of the producer, in the
vent of superfluities;

The profit of the merchant, in the

balance remaining, after he has paid
cost and expences;

z 2 The

The profit of the Rate, in the in-

crease of wealth, or the accumula-
tion of commodities in the poIfeflion
of its members.

Commerce, by accommodating all

parties with what they want in ex-
change for what they can spare, en-
ables and encourages them to in-
crease their produce.

Ccmmerce refpeding the Rtate, is
either internal or foreign.

Internal commerce is the exchange

of commmodities between fubjeOs
of the fame Rate.

Foreign commerce is the exchange

of commodities between fubjeds of
different fiates.

In PRates of considerable extent,

the internal commerce is of more
consequence than the foreign com-
merce.

The importance of foreign com-

merce diminishes as the PRate ex-
tends.

Commerce between nations may

be

be confidered in refpec: to the ba-
lance of price, or the balance of va-
lue.

The balance of price commonly

flands for the difference supposed to,
remain due by one nation to another,
jafter appretiating the whole goods
that have passed in exchange be-
tween them.

The balance of value is the dif-

ference of real value in the whole
goods that have passed in exchange.

The profits of foreign commerce

are determined by the ba'ance of
value, not by the balance of price.

The nation that has the balance

of price against it, may have the
balance of value in its favour. It
may have received the means of de-
fence, of improving its land, or of
extending its trade, &c.

The nation that owes. the balance

of price, will be obliged to part
with its money, or some other cornm

Z3. , imodity.,.

modity, in order to pay that ba-
lance.

A trade in which a balance of

price is incurred, cannot be conti-
nued, unless there be a continual
supply of money, or other commo-
dity, by which the balance may be
paid.

The produce of land is a conti-

nual, and may be made an increa-
fng supply.

The produce of mines, or the

importation of money, may be con-
tinual.

Nations who carry on any part of

their internal trade by credit and
bills, need proportionally less sup-
plies of money.

The uie of bills in circulation
tends to extend credit.

Credit is useful or pernicious, ac-

cording to the use that is made of
it.

It is useful to an industrious and
thriving people.

It%

It is pernicious- to the spendthrift
and the prodigal.

The expence of remitting money

from one country to another, affects
the exchange of their coins.

That nation which has occasion

to remit most money, muff pay this
gxpence, and is said to have the ex-
change againit it.

But as money may be remitted

to make profit, it does not follow
from the state of exchange, that a
nation is either gainer or loser by
trade..

The profits of trade are either
mutual or partial..

They are mutual, so far as com-

merce accommodates all parties with
what they want, in exchange for
what they can spare; and enables
every party to improve his peculiar
materials, and to pursue his pecu-liar
art; and procures to the merchant
and carrier an adequate reward for
their trouble,

In

In commerce mutually beneficial,

that party gains molt who receives
the more ufcful commodity; and
who receives the produce of much
land, time, and labour, for the pro-
duce of less; and who, in condu&-
ing his trade, is employed in the
more healthful and least corrupting
occupations.

The profit of trade is partial, when

things of value are exchanged for
things of no value.

The following are laws of com-

merce, founded in the preceding
considerations.

I. That, where profits are mu-

tual, commerce should not be re-
firained by either party.

2. That, if we suppose a trade to

terminate in giving the means of
accommodation and subsistence in
exchange for mere ornaments, such
trade may be wisely restrained by the
losing party.

3. That monopolies are pernicious
to. commerce,

4. That;

## SECT. IV. Of Revenue.

4. That the Rfate of a nation's

wealth is not to be estimated from
the slate of its coffers, granaries, or
warehouses, at any particular time;
but from the fertility of its lands,
from the numbers, frugality, indu-
ftry, and ikill of its people.

SECT. IV.

Of Revenue.
TH HAT part of national wealth

which is allotted for purposes

of state, is the public revenue.
- The public revenue may arise from
demesne and unappropriated fubjeds,
or from taxes.

The firit is the earliest species of

revenue in rude nations, and is suit-
ed to their indolence, and ignorance
of lucrative arts.

The second is better suited to the

induitry and skill of commercial na-
tions.

It

It is not the interest of commer-

cial nations, that any fubjedt should
remain unappropriated. While a
fubjeCd remains unappropriated, it is
coinlmon]y neglecaed.

Revenue arising fiom taxation,

may increase together with the num-
bers, wealth, and frugality of the
people.

in judging of the absolute or

comparative expediency of different
taxes, the following axioms may be
admitted.

i. That the exigencies of the state

muff be provided for at any hazard
or expence to the liibjedt.

2. That, in levying taxes, no sub-
je& be unnecessarily burdened.

3. That the security of the sub-

ject, or that of his property, be not
impaired.

4. That taxes which check fettle-
ment and industry be avoided.

5. That taxes least felt as grie-
vances be preferred.

6. That

6. That the least burdensome

method of collecting taxes be cho-
fen.

N. B. The methodof farm ap-

pears, from experience, to be more
burdensome than that of revenue-
office.

Taxes may be referred to four
general heads:

Capitation, Assessment, Customs,
and Excise.

Capitation is a tax on the person,

and falling equally on the poor and
the rich.

Capitation may be oppressive to

the poor, without levying from the
rich what they are able to furnish
to the fRate.

Capitation is a symptom of de-
fpotic and oppressive government.

Assessment is a tax on riches, and
is proportioned to the estate assessed.

Affelfments may fall equitably,

when property is unequally diftri-
buted.

Land-

Land-eflate being most easily as-

certained and valued, is the pioper-
eft fubjrEt of affeflmnent.

The flock of the merchant is fluc-

tuating; and attempts made to afcer-
tain it might-give occasion to frauds,
or improperly disclose the secrets of
trade.

Customs are taxes imposed on

goods in commerce, and advanced
by the merchant.

Customs imposed on the neceffa-

ries of life, are a tax on the poor,
and have the effeds of capitation.

Cuftons imposed on matters of

ornament, or cofly accommodation,
are a tax on the prodigal, or the
rich.

Such taxes are most agreeable to
humanity and justice.

Customs are an incumbrance on

trade, and may amount to a prohi-
bition of particular articles.

Customs, though advanced by the
merchant, fall on the consumer;

but

but being involved in the price of
the commodity, are not commonly
felt as a tax.

As the merchant muff not only

be reimbursed, but have profit on
all his advance, it follows, that the
earlier in trade cuftoms'are paid for
any commodity, the heavier they
must fall on the consumer.

Excise is a tax on commodities in
use, and paid by the confurner.

Excise may be rendered a tax,

either on the rich or the poor fepa-
rately, or on both proportionally.

Excise is less burdenomne to the

consumer, than an equivalent rai-
fed in customs ; but is more likely
to be felt as a grievance, and to
create more animosity in the subject
against the state.

The most perfect laws- relating to

the constitution, are fuchl as confer
on the magistrate power to restrain
crimes, and to defend the commu-
nity; but under limitations fuffi-
cient to prevent the abuse. of. this
power.

The most perfet laws relating to

civil rights, are such as effedually
secure every person in his state.

It is the maxim of civil. law, That

every. person Ihould remain. in his
pofieffion, until a better title be. un-
doubtedly. proved.

be to correa.the guilty, and to de-
ter others.

7. That the punihlment be. not
uch as would shock hum anity, or

To secure legal rights, it is necef-

fary that the laws fllould be ftridly
interpreted and applied.

Under the government of law,

discretionary powers are not safely
intrusted, except to judges named
by the parties; or to juries purged
by the challenge of parties, and in-
terested equally to protet the inno-
cent and to punish the guilty.

In the security of rights confifis
civil and political liberty.

Liberty is opposed to injustice,

riot to restraint; for liberty cannot
subsist without the supposition of e-
very just restraint.

Natural liberty is not impaired,

as sometimes supposed, by political
institutions, and is impaired only by
usurpations and wrongs.

which distribute the benefits and the
burdens of civil society in the most
equitable manner. But it is no finall
measure of liberty to be secured in
the possession of what the law be-
stows.

SECT. V.
Of the Political Happiness of a Peo-

ple.

IH E political happiness of a

T people consists in the love of
their country, and in that diftribu-
tion of rank and flation which is
best suited to their merits and capa-
cities.

Men who are least aduated by

separate interests are best disposed to:
love their country.

Men who have the fewest adven-
titious diflindions of birth or for-

tune,.

tune, are most likely to be classed
according to their merits, to be
employed suitably to their abilities,
and to find the flations in which
they are most likely to cultivate their
talents, and their virtues.

That a community may be loved

in the highest degree, its members
should be relieved of personal an-
xieties, and occupied in what relates
to the public.

They ihould be made to confider

the fRate as the equal parent of all,
distributing equal benefits, and re-
quiring equal services.

:Wherever the state confines poli-
tical consideration to a particular
order, who sacrifice the rights of o-
thers to their own interest or fancy,
it cannot be loved.

The reason and the heart of man

are best cultivated in arduous fitua-
tions, and in the exercise of public
duties.

Of the Preferable InJfitution or Form

of Government.
:NTOTWITHSTANDING what we

may conceive, in general,

as desirable for mankind, every po-
litical question must have a reference
to some particular cafe, and must
be determined according to the cir-
cumflances of that cafe.

Men of speculation have in vain

endeavoured to fix a model of go-
vernment equally adapted to all
mankind.

One people is unfit to govern, or

to be governed, in the fame manner
with another.

Nations differ in respeCt to cha-

raAer, and in refpea to their state
or condition.

The charaaer of a people refers

to

to their degree of virtue, or of other
principle, on which the state may
rely for the discharge of 'civil and
political duties.

<':he ifate or condition of a peo-

ple is determined chiefly by 'their
casual filbordinations, "and by the
extent of their country.

Casual fubiordination is founded

in diftihaionsi original'or adventi-
tious.

Original diftindtions are, the dif-

ferences of capacity, disposition, and
force.
\ Adventitious diftintions arise
from fortune and birth."

QUeflions relating to the proprie-

ty of any political institution, can
'be solved only hypothetically.

Such questions may be put on
four different suppositions.

FIRST SUPPOSITION.

The supposition of a people per-
fectly virtuous, diftinguiihed from

Bb one

one another only by their original
differences, -and forming states of
small extent.

Such a people are fitted to govern
themselves.

They may consent to be govern-

ed by the majority of their own
number, or occasionally by single
men; but to oblige such men by
force to resign the sense of their
own minds, and to follow what is
different from it, were, by the sup-
position, to substitute vice for virtue.

Being perfecly virtuous, every

one will be willing to bear his share
of the public burdens, and will re-
ceive, in his turn, that confidence
and trust for which he is by his
capacity and experience qualified.

They are supposed to have no ad-

ventitious diftindions to mar the
effed of their personal qualities.

Beiing of finall extent, the whole

may be occasionally or periodically
assembled.

They

They need no precaution against

the commission of crimes, or the
abuses of power.

The sole objec of government is,

to assemble, and to dired their force
for national purposes.

This, however, is a mere fuppo-

fition; for no entire nation was
ever known to be perfetly virtu-
ous.

SECOND SUPPOSITION.

A people in whom the virtuous

and the vicious are mixed.; who
admit adventitious diftinaions in
different degrees,- and form states of
various extent.

This is not a mere supposition, it

is realised, and the most general de-
scription of mankind.

If there be no great separation

or diftinaion of rank and condi-
tion;

If virtue greatly prevail over
vice';

Bb2 If

If the slate be of fmiall extent;
Such a people are fit fcr demo-
cracy.

Their numbers admit of being
aflembled in colledtive bodies.

Their virtues and their inflitu-

tions may prevent crimes, and a-
buses of power.

They may reap the advantages of

demnocracy, in a manner that will
more than compensate its inconve-
niencies.

If such a people be separated in-

to different orders or classes, they
are fitted to aristocracy, mixed re-
public, or mixed monarchy.

If in two claftes, one is diftin-

guifhed from the other by a confi-
derable superiority, they are fit for
aristocracy.

Commercial nations of a small

extent are, in the result of diftinc-
tions that arise from the praatice of
arts, and the unequal distribution

of

of property, best fitted to ariftrocra-
tical government, or to mixed re-
public.

The inferior class, if not greatly

debased or corrupted, may have a
Ihare in the government, either by
a negative on the determination of
the aristocracy, or by being intrust-
ed, not with an ative part in the
government, but only with the
choice of those who are to ad for
them.

The fame supposition applied to

flates of a greater extent, and to a
people among whom a greater va-
riety of rank is established, will
ju'fify the preference of mixed mo-
nalchy.

It were happy for mankind, if,

together with changes of circum-
stances, they could always make
suitable changes in government, and
no more.

Where changes of circumstance

B b 3 are

are gradual, corresponding changes
of government take place; but fud-
den innovations of any fort, preci-
pitare men into situations in which
they, are not qualified to a&.

THIRD SUPPOSITION.

A people on whose vanity, and

sense of personal importance, ra-
ther than virtue, the fate must rely
for the discharge of the civil and
political duties; a people amongst
whom a continual adventitious sub.
ordination takes place, without any
example, or any desire, of equality.

Such a people are not fit to go-
vern themselves.

The continual gradation of rank

must terminate in a prince or mo-
narch.

They require monarchy as a

bond of union, and as a source of
honour.

While every one attends to what
concerns himself, the monarch, for

the

the preservation of his own person
and dignities, must attend to the
public safety, and public order.

The subordinate ranks will court

his favour, and consult their own
dignity, by adions, either splendid
in themselves, or useful to the fRate,
whilst they are serviceable to the
king.

The members of the slate are

drawn together; and moved in a
body, not by their love to the com-
munity, or to mankind, but by their
veneration for their common fupe-
rior, and by their expetations from
their common source of preferment
and honour.

The maxims of honour are not

susceptible of sudden changes; and
the dignities of family, though for
the most part conferred by the
prince, are hereditary, and there-
fore independent.

Both these circumstances oblige

the prince to govern according to
fixed and determinate laws.

FOURTH

FOURTH SUPPOSITION.

A people perfectly vicious, with-

out sense of honour, or hereditary
diftindions.

Such a people must be restrained
by force.

Every constitution, even that

which confides most in the virtue
of the subjed, muff employ force to
repress crimes.

If the whole people be inclined

to commit crimes, and be ieftrain-
ed only by fear, the profpec of
prompt and terrifying punishments
muff be continually placed in their
view.

This supposition may be employ-
ed as an apology'for despotism.

Where every person is disposed

to commit crimes, the fewer that
have power, so much the better.

When all power is committed to
one person, even supposing hiifelf

10

to be a criminal, it is-his interest,
for the most part, to restrain the
crimes of others.

His severities, or cruelties, by the

supposition, can no where affligt the
innocent.

His dominions, though, like a

prison, committed to the keeping of
vile and merciless men, is neverthe-
less the only fit place to. receive
those who cannot be otherwise re-
firained from injustice.

But this cafe, like that which

was first stated, of a people perfed-
ly virtuous, is a mere supposition,
and never was realised in the cha-
racer of any people.

Men are generally as far from the

extreme of perfet vice, as they are
from that of perfeE virtue.

They who contend, that defpo-

tical government is in' fat the bes
for mankind, proceed upon four
suppositions, all equally violent and
false.

I.

I. That all men would commit
crimes if they durst.

2. That crimes cannot be restrain-
ed without discretionary powers.

3. That a person to whom dif-

cretionary powers are committed,
will employ them to repress the
crimes of others, but not to com-
mit crimes of his own.

4. That the sole object of govern-

ment is, to controul the adions,
never to cultivate the nature or
form the characers of men.

These suppositions are contrary
to reason and to experience.

The facl is, that the manners of

men are various; and that the fame
penal laws, and forms ofjuftice, by
which a people may be successfully
governed in a virtuous age, will not
always be lufficient to restrain them
in ages corrupted.

When the criminal passions in-
crease in violence and boldness, it

may

may be necessary to increase the
measure of punishments.

When crimes multiply, and cri-

minals are enabled to employ the
forms of law as the subterfuges of
iniquity, it may be necessary to al-
ter such defective forms: But it ne-
ver can be necessary to deprive the
innocent of all the defences of rea-
son and justice; for the fame rea-
son and justice which protect the
innocent, may condemn the guilty.

In times of occasional tumult,

popular frenzy, or rebellion, it may
be necessary to treat those who com-
mit fich crimes, not as fubjeds a-
menable to the laws, but as enemies,
who, by invading the public peace,
have deprived every citizen of his
safety, and who therefore can-
not have the benefit of laws until
the public has recovered its fecuri-
ty.

Such domestic disorders, like so-
reign wars, render' discretionary

power

power occasionally necessary: But
this necessity is only temporary..

For the most part, even -in cor-

rupted itates, it is as much the in-
terest of the fubjet.as of the magi-
firate, to keep the peace, and to re-
press crimes.

Absolute despotism is an extreme

of ideal corruption: Every avoid-
able approach to it is an usurpation
and a national misfortune.

It tends to produce that extremity

of vice to which it is supposed to be
adapted as a remedy.

The objec of defpotical govern-

ment, is not to secure the subjea in
the possession of his rights, but to
make him a property; not to sup-
press vice, but to suppress the high-
eft and noblest virtues of the heart,
public spirit, independence, and
courage.

SECT.

## SECT. VII. Of the fit Distribution of Trust and Office.

S E C T. VII.
Of the ft Distribution of 7ruil and

Office.
A S men of different characters

and in different. circumflances,

require a variety of institutions, so
different constitutions of govern-
ment require or imply a different
distribution of truft-and office.

In free governments of every de-

nomination, where law is necessary,
the law muff be enacted, interpre-
ted, and executed. Hence the of-
sices or functions of state are, legis-
lation, jurifdidion, and execution.

Legislation, under every confi-

tution of government, is the imme-
diate aac of the sovereign power,
and cannot be delegated without
tiansferring the sovereignty.

This rule does not exclude the

C c con-

concurrence of councils, nor the
observance of forms suited to the
constitution.

Under democracies, the legifa-

tion is exercised by the collective
body; but it is not necessary that
the colleCtive body should delibe-
rate, as well as decide.

The colleaive body may name

senates, or feled councils, to prepare
questions of legislation.

They may vary the form of col-

leaing the votes, or of promulga-
ting the law.

They may fix, at discretion, what

numlbers are required to constitute
a legal assembly, and what propor-
tion of those present muftl concur
in a public resolution.

Under ariftocracies, the collecive

body of those who govern, whether
by elecive or hereditary title, must
exercise the legifiature.

They may at, notwithstanding,
under the fame forms and limita-

tions

tions that have been mentioned as
compatible with the sovereignty of
the whole people.

Under monarchy, the legislature
is exercised by the king.

The king stands in need of coun-

cils; and his legislative power mnay
l)e qualified by the forms of regi-
ftration, or promulgation, required
to.give the force of law to his e-
dic's.

In mixed government of any fort,

the legislature must be exercised by
the concurrence of all the collateral
powers.

If a law could be enacted with-

out the concurrence of any single
power, that power might be sup-
pressed by the others.

If the supposed collateral powers

were to afiemble, and decide que-
ilions of legislation by the majority,
any way defined, the government
would cease to be mixed.

The sovereignty of collateral pow-

C c 2 ers

ers is compatible with a variety of
forms relating to the proposing and
the ena~ling of laws.

Sovereigns of any denomination,

who have suffered courts of justice
to follow custom as a rule of deci-
sion, are to be understood as having
eftabliffied thaticuftom into law.

Jurifdi&ion, or the office ofjudge,

is, to interpret the law, and to ap-
ply it in particular cafes.

This office, under every conftitu-

tion, hnould be disjoined from that.
of iegiflation.

The sovereign, being accustomed

to will, or to command, cannot sub-
mit merely to interpret, or to fol-
lo. a rule.

Particular cafes are modified by

circumnaiances that create prejudice,
or excite paflion.

The sovereign, having no fupe-

rior, may follow prejudice or pas-
sion at discretion.

The sovereign having enacted the

law,

law, would, under the influence of
special motives, make free to dif-
penfe with it.

Popular or numerous assemblies
would be swayed by fation.

Princes would be swayed by their
passions, and by solicitation.

Two queflions may be put rela-
ting tojudicature :

I. Who ought to judge ?
2. Of what numbers are courts
of justice best composed ?

r. Wherever laws are 'greatly

multiplied, the knowledge of law
becomes a profefiion.

No.judgment can be safely given

without the counsel of those who
are knowing in the law.

The office for which counsel is

neceflary, is that of pointing out
the law, and the whole law, in any
particular cafe.

Persons who are not lawyers by

profession, may, in the manner of
the judges at Rome, and of the ju-

c c3 ries

ries in Great Britain, interpret and
apply a law which is pointed out
to them.

Betide the counsel employed by

parties, the public may employ coun-
fel for justice and law. This is the
nature of official judges in Great
Britain.

Jurifdition committed entirely

to official judges, is attended with
the following inconveniencies.

The official judge being a conti-

nual magistrate, may entertain the
prejudices of the magistrate against
the fubje&.

The peculiar prejudices and par-

tialities of the official judge, if he
has any, may be known.

They who enjoy his favour, are

tempted to .trespass in hopes of im-
punity, or to commence vexatious
suits in hopes of success.

They who apprehend his difplea-

sure, do not feel themselves secure
even in possession of innocence.

These

These inconveniencies are remo-

ved, in a great measure, by the e-
fiablifhment of judicatures in the
Roman form, or in that of juries.

The juryman is equally interested

to protect the innocent, and to con-
demn the guilty.

Juries may therefore be intrusted

with some measures of discretionary
power, to mitigate the rigours of
law, or to supply its defets.

Where a people are divided into

a number' of separate orders and
classes, as those of Patrician, Eque-
ftrian, and Plebeian, Lords and Com-
mons, the rights of one order are
not safely intrusted to the judgment
of another; and it would be expe-
dient, that every party were judged
by his peers.

2. Under popular or republican

governments of any fort, courts of
justice are belt composed of few
members.

Courts composed of many mem-

bers

bers carry popular faction and party
into the judgment-feat. The in-
dividual hopes to screen hiimfelf
even in judging falsely, under the
authority and credit of the whole
body.

No one is accountable; no one is

conspicuous; all are tempted to
humour their party, and to judge at
discretion.

Under monarchy, courts of ju-
slice are best composed of many.

Here the influence of the crown

is more to be dreaded, than the sac-
tion of the people,

This influence can less overawe

or corrupt numerous bodies, than
single men, or a few.

*Num.eous bodies, in their deli-

berations, admit of the zeal and ar-
dour that animate popular assem-
blies; and even whilit they do not
judge more impartially than single
men would do, they judge with
more independence.

The

The spirit of facion, which in re-

public is the greatest corruption,
in monarchy tends to prevent a
greater, servility to those in power.

The office of the executive is, to

apply the force of the state for na-
ticnal purposes:

I. To give effe&t to the laws.
2, To defend the community a-
gainft foreign enemies.

Occasions on which the executive

must be exerted, are either continual
or casual; and in cafe of danger
from abroad, require secrecy and
despatch.

The sovereign in republican go-

vernments, consisting of the whole
people, or of numerous bodies, can-
not exercise the executive.

Such bodies cannot be continual-

ly assembled, nor ready to assemble
at all times.

The resolutions of the executive
require more secrecy and despatch

than

than can be had in any numerous
or popular assemblies.

Affairs that come in course, or

that admit of delay, may be com-
mitted to senates, or to felea coun-
cils. Such are the management of
public revenue, negociations, and
treaties.

Affairs that may come fortui-

toufly, and by surprise, ,that will
not admit of delay, muff be com-
mitted to finale men; as to the ma-
giftrate, or officer who has the keep-
ing of the peace, and the leading of
armies.

"Under monarchy, whether pure
or mixed, the king is capable of e-
very branch of the executive.

But he ought to delcgate what-

ever tends to render his power ter-
rible or odious;

To reserve what renders it an ob-
ject of refpet or affection.

The abuses of the executive pow-

er

er are variously refrained under dif-
ferent constitutions.

.In republics, they are leftrained
by the short duration of office in the
person of any individual, by the
vigilance and emulation of his com-
petitors, if not by his own virtue
and moderation.

Those were the happiest repu-

blics, who educated virtuous citi-
zens, to whom any powers might
be safely intrusted.

Some .of the most important

powers, both in Sparta and at Rome;
were discretionary.

In monarchy, the abuses of the

executive are refIrained by the forms
of law, and by the privileges of
subordinate ranks.

In all coniitunons they may be

restrained by hL.t ing magiitrates and
minilters acolili:.ahie.

By the iti,:crity of those who

conithitcue tio .orce

co n nirte. to
the directionl of tile executive.

## SECT. VIII. Conclusion.

When the armed force is part of

the people, it is their interest, as
well as their duty, to refrain from
abuse.

S E CT. VIII.

Conclusion.
JT may appear from a comparison

of the faa, as stated in the his-

tory of the species, with what is
now flated as the law of political
expedience, that men generally ac-
commodate their establishments to
their circumfiances, and that, upon
the supposition of such circumftan-
ces, there is little room for improve-
ment.

Men of probity and courage, in

small communities, have recourse to
Republican government.

Men distinguished by inequalities
of birth, and acauated by sentiments

of

of honour,: have. ranged under mo-
narchs. :

Large empires continue to be go-

verned, as they are formed,. by
force.
. Mixed descriptions of men,- led
by the variety of circumstances in
which they are placed, have exhibi-
ted a corresponding variety of. mix.
ed governments. And the ifiTe in
every cafe has been such, that where
we cannot mateially change the
character and circumstances of the
people, it would be folly to attempt
any radical change in the form of
government.

, In speculation, we form general
views and look into distant confe-
quences; but the first maxim of
found speculation is, where matters
go tolerably well, to beware of
change.

If therefore it be supposed, that

an itch of political reformation is
dangerous to mankind, it is not sup-
ported by knowledge.

D d The

The ignorant are as apt to tamper

with the best confittution, as to re-
form the worst. In general, they
are tenacious of custom: but in some
particulars are desirous of change.

The genius of mankind leads to

progression. Every order of men,
and every individual, apprehend an,
inconvenience which they would re-
move, or an advantage they would
gain, and they would break through
every form to attain their end.

Arts, commerce, population, as

they advance or decline, give rife to
new circumstances, and suggest fuc-
ceffive arrangements.

The people under the pressure of

great inconveniences, break out in-
to revolts and effec great revolu-
tions; under the pressure of the least
inconveniency they- seek for propor-
tional relief, and in the process of
time, by small alterations, produce a
material and sensible effet.

In this current, we may wifl to
accelerate, retard, or dire. the mo-

the

tion, but it is the nature of man to
proceed. In fleering our.courfe, it
is material to know the tendency
of changes, whether the effie is to
be near or remote.

In every political deliberation, it

is material to know what is best for
mankind, -that we may depart from
it as little as possible.

A well informed underean ,ing,

in the worst fituarions, may fecultre
some happy effe-s, though far ihort
of the ideal perfection which the
speculative are apt to look for in
the affairs of men.

.Political interests, are those of all

others which ought least to be con-
mitted to chance. Our safety, our
peace, our relation one to anothier,.
our improvement or degeneracy, de-
pend in a great measure on our poli-
tical inifitutions. By these our rights.
are preserved or violated, our rela-
tion is made to approach to that of
equals, or to that of master and

d 2 slave,.

slave, crimes are repressed or licen-
fed.

Political institutions tend to aug-

ment the good or the- evil with
which they are fraught.

Human affairs, in some inflances,

tend to improvement; in others, to
corruption.

The inflitutions of men, in one

cafe, promote their improvement;
in the other, haften their corruption.

Infitutions that proceed on max-

ims of justice, that engage the minds
of citizens in public duties, that
teach them to estimate rank :by the
reaiure of personal qualities, tend
to preserve and to cultivate virtue.

On the contrary, institutions by

which men are stripped of their
lights, or by which they are made
to hcld their poffciTiors at difcre-
tion, under which they are fuppo-
fed governable only by force, or
by the fear of punifiment, tend

tion,

to beget tyranny and insolence in
the powerful, servility and vile-
ness in the dependent; to cover every
visage with paleness *, and to fill
every heart with jealousy or dejec-
tion.

The greatest and most extensive

benefit which the wife can procure,
is the establishment or preservation
ofju1f institutions.

The greatest injury that wicked

men can commit, is the overthrow
or corruption of such institutions.
