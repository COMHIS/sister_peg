Groningen October 4th 1756

My Lord

Mr Fletcher and I arrived safe here a few days ago, & have introduced him to some of my acquaintances [xxx], & engaged a lodging for him at which he slept last night, in the house of a Person who has passed some time in England, & is now setled here as a teacher of the English and French languages. This House was recommended by Mr. Swartz the Professor of Law, & I thought it lucky for Mr Fletcher at first to find a Landlord he coud speak to.

We have not yet fixed upon an Ordinary for him, but hope in a few days to setle that point likewise. I have been inquiring into the particulars of his expence here, & will be able to inform your Lordship fully in my next or on my return to Scotland. We have drawn upon Mr Crawfurd for five and Twenty Pounds, as Mr Fletchers Allowance for the first quarter. This money as far as I have hitherto been informed, may probably be sufficient for him at this place.

One of the Persons I have made him acquainted with here is Professor of Anatomy & has very good reputation as a Physician. If Mr Fletcher's health shoud require his Attendance, I have great confidence in his Skill & Attention. We have a Countreyman setled here, Mr Falkner a Brother of Lord  Hackertons. Mr Fletcher brought him a letter from Mr Crawfurd to procure him Credit & give his assistance in any thing thing else he might stand in need of. Mr Falkner has been very Civil & I hope, will be extremely usefull to Mr Fletcher while he stays here. Our expence in all to this place amounts to about three & thirty Guineas, we stayed for a Wind at Harwick some Days after I wrote your Lordship & had a very tedious passage, which detained us in all about ten days. I have delivered your Lordships letter to Mr Fletcher, he was much affected with it, & tells me he will send the Copy of it by me. As I hope He will be fully setled here in a litle time, I can scarcely expect to hear from your Lordship at this place. The way from here to Amsterdam is almost impassable when the Winter weather begins, which will make it necessary for me to set out the sooner.

We made no stay at any place in Holland & gave litle attention to the Publick news. The People I have talked with seem to think this Countrey in the Utmost danger from all Quarters. They are threatned by every formidable Power in Europe, & required to declare themselves, which they are so far from Venturing to do that they dare not make the least augmentation of their Troops for fear of giving Umbrage to their Neighbours. The People at Present seem to be stromgly affected to the King of Prussia, they consider the War in Germany as a Religious one, & think the Protestant Interest at Stake, so much for news which I remember your Lordship was pleased to desire .

I shall be able in my next to inform your Lordship of every thing relating to Mr Fletchers setlement at this place.

My Lord

In my last I told your Lordship how far I had gone in setling Mr Fletcher here; & did not then think it necessary to wait for a return from your Lordship, Mr Fletcher was indeed then very melancholy but I was in hopes that might go off in a few days, it has however increased to such a degree that I cannot think of leaving him so soon as I proposed, without even a Servant who in case of further Changes, might at least procure him the offices of Humanity. I am very well aware what your Lordship must feel from these appearances for my own disstress is beyond expression. I cannot for[e]see what I may be obliged to do before I can hear from your Lordship, perhaps to return to Brittain, where a properer place might be found for Mr Fletcher till his melancholy goes off, than any here, he is at present disqualified by it for doing any thing. I am hurryed in writing this as the Post is just going away & I was not able to determine myself what to propose  to your Lordship sooner. I feel great uneasiness in a Situation Subject to blame without advice or Authority from those who shoud direct me. Your Lordship will please to direct for me (Au Parlament d'Angleterre a Groningue) or to the Care of Mr Crawfurd at Rotterdam.

My Lord

Mr Fletcher has appeared so much better for some days past, that I am preparing to set out on my return, I am still not without uneasiness on his account but inclined to believe that this Situation is as favourable for him as any that coud be found. His Landlord has promised me a particular Attention to all his Affairs, & to call for the accounts regularly every week of such people as furnish him any thing here. He has hitherto since we set out given no signs of dissorder, & has been cautious with respect to drinking although I did not appear to restrain him in that Particular. The degree of Melancholy which possessed him perplexed me very much as I am hurried to leave this place both by the winter season coming on & my apprehensions of an Ague which used to trouble me in this Country.

As his Spirits seem to have taken a turn to the Better  I hope it may Please God to restore him fully to his former applications & Temper of Mind, he seems to be out of the way here of what formerly [xxx] might have missled & disstracted his mind. I thought it necessary however to take what precautions I could in case of the Worst. Mr Falconer whom I formerly mentioned to your Lordship, & to whom he is recommended by Mr Crawfurd, promised me to take particular care of him, & as I have informed him in confidence of the former state of his health he will be able to suit his care to that circumstance. I likewise explained his case to Dr Vandoeveren Professor of Anatomy, in whom I have much confidence as a Physician and as an Obliging Worthy Man, both agreed in thinking that his Present Landlord is a very proper person for him to lodge with, his name is Le Moine, & as I gave him your Lordships Adress, he will not fail to write if any thing remarkable occurs. If your Lordship has any commands for him Please direct (A Monsr Monsr Le Moine Maitre de Langues a Groninguen by Holland).

Mr Fletcher has given me a Copy of your Lordships last letter to him, and at his earnest desire I have  left the Latin Newtestament with him. I have computed his Stated expence for one half year.

Which in British money amounts to twenty four Pounds seven Shillings and eight pence. There are other Particulars besides Cloaths which I coud not compute such as Candles Tea Sugar &c. We have lately had a Storm in this Countrey which has cast many Wrecks on the Coast & greatly the Damaged the Shipping which plys in this Country. I intended to take the favourable weather which now offers to get over the Lakes and Marshes of Friesland.

I wrote your Lordship a litle before I set out from Groninguen, of the resolution I had taken & did not find any reason to Alter it. Mr Fletcher continued to recover his Spirits, & since I set out I have the Satisfaction of a letter from his Landlord; which came to hand at this place, telling me he was very well, & begun to talk & employ himself more than when I was at Groninguen.

I have come here in order to meet with some company or find out some convenient way of travelling to Scotland & don't intend to make any Stay. I sent your Lordship in my last some computation of Mr Fletchers Stated articles of expence where he now is. I am sorry that this Journey shoud have been so expensive to your Lordship, & earnestly wish  the Satisfaction may be answerable, which I hope it will. The whole according to the best account I have been able to keep of the Particulars amounts to £53:2:5. The delays in waiting for Passages has increased the expence a good deal. I hope to be in Scotland soon & defer further Particulars till then. I am My Lord

[Groningen, October 1756] 

Dear Sir

as Mr Fletcher is a litle better within this day or two I have taken the resolution to set out on my return. I am sensible of the precarious Situation he is in but I think it more agreeable to his Fathers intentions to leave him here under the inspection of proper people than bring him back to Brittain where it woud be difficult to setle him so well as he now is with Le Moine. If it please God that he does Well it will give great Satisfaction to all his Friends. If any change to the Worse happens I hope he will not want for proper care. I have been With Dr Van Doeveren this morning he has promised to advise with you about Mr Fletcher & to take care of his health & as I have told him his whole case you may be free with him upon it.

Mr Le Moine will give you notice if he Observes any thing amiss about Mr Fletcher, in particular if he disscovers any intention of leaving this place, I should consider that as a symptom of his dissorder returning & woud think it necessary to detain him even by force & to hire a keeper for him, till further directions can be had from his Friends. It was his Fathers intention that he shoud have the laying out of his money,  & he has disscovered Nothing hitherto that shoud make one alter that circumstance for he seems at present no way dissposed to throw it away. I have desired the Favour of Le Moine to give great attention to his expence & in particular to bring to him regularly every week the demands of such people as furnish him any thing. If notwithstanding, you find that he does manage his Money matters well, pray take the trouble to give his Friends Notice of it, & use what methods you think most proper to keep his next quarters allowance from coming into his own hands. In that case some Friend here must have credit for, & the dissposal of what money may be necessary for him. I have not explained the whole case to Le Moine but he has promised me that upon seeing any thing amiss he will let Dr Vandoeveren & you know it immediatly, when you will be able to determine what to do. You see with what Freedom I trouble you & do not in the least doubt your Willingness to Oblige My Lord Milton & contribute to the Wellfare of a Very worthy young Gentleman.

I am &c
