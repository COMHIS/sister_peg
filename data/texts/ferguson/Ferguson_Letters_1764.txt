My Lord

I have drawn out & enclosed the Scroll of such a Paragraph as your Lordship perhaps will think proper to insert in your letter to the Ld P:S: relating to Coll. Fletchers Affair. It may proceed or follow what relations are to be sent of the Perthshire election.

I have likewise inclosed inclosed a short memorandum of the Proposal I mentioned relating to the College & am with the greatest Respect.

My Lord 
your Lordships 
most Obedient & most 
humble Servant

My Lord

Being informed of an Intention to appoint me Professor of Moral Philosophy in the place of Mr Balfour who has resigned in order to make way for Mr Russell to succeed me in the Professorship of Natural Philosophy: I hereby give my full consent to the part of this Arrangement which depends on me, & intend this letter to your Lordship as a resignation of my present office of Professor of Natural Philosophy in the College of Edinburgh in order that the other parts of this Arrangement may be put in execution. I have the honour to be with the greatest Respect to your Lord Lordship & the Town Council

My Lord 
your Lordships most Obliged 
& most humble Servant

I have this moment received the inclosed Estimate by which the joiner work required in my Class amounts to Â£5. 19, which with about four pound allowed for Paper & Other repairs will I hope put the place in some decent order. This I hope the Comittee are sensible it needs & I beg that you will take the trouble to move the Council that I may be allowed ten pounds for this Purpose. I am Sr

With the greatest regard 
your most Obedient & most humble Servant 
Adam Ferguson
