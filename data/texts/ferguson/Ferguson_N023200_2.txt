LATELY PU;BLISHED BY DR. PRICE.

In a LET Ti E R to a ME MB ER Of PA RL IA M eNT.

S I R,

SSEND you some Remarks upon Dr.

Price's Pamphlet, concernmng which

you do me the honour to desire my opi-
nion. A gentleman who gives his name
to the Public is intitled to have the fairest
confirudtion put upon his words, and I
thall be extremely sorry if, in diffe~ring
from Dr. Price, an y expreflion escape
from me that is too abrupt for thle rerpedt
that is due to him. As I am a mere
comnme ntator, I am likely to be as dull as
the reft of my fraternity, but thall ne-
verthelefs, abide by the order, anld con-
fine mnyf~ef to the matter, th~at is filggefted
b~y rny -Author.

As You

E:43

You will please to obl~erve, that` the

Dodtor rests his argument on a definition
of Civil Liberty, which is therefore a prin-
cipal fubjea of these Remarks. He con-
fiders Liberty under four general diviflons,
Physical L~iber-ty, Morall Libecrty, Reh~giouser
,Liberty, and CEivil Libte~rty: (ia). Th~le fidft is
the pr~inslek of /pontancity. T he second is
the ptrower of followreing: our own eftS~S of ight~
and wr·ontg. T he third, the power of exer-
cyling the rehgionz wee like bes2. And the
f~ourth, or Civil Liberty, is the p~artere of a
civil focietry or f/2ate to governe itelf by its owen
d;Jretion .

The Dodtor, in the following inference

from: all thele definitions collated together,
puts Liberty· in contradistinc~tion to Re-
ficaint, and. makies Reftfraint, in every
cafe,~ the essence of Slaviery. In all there
cafes, he fay s, there is a force wehJich2ad~s
.pppofed to thet agent's own CWIl,~! anrd: wh~ich,
las f/tr azs it operates,. pPTrodues ferv~itrde·.
Anrd he conc~ludes the wh~Iole deduaion
w ith· obl~erving, that as far ar:in arny~ infance
the- operaZtio o~f any c~ause comes in to re2rar~n
the' powreer of f/etlf-g·overnmenat, Sfo far favery is

introduced.

Es]

intr-odurced. Nor· do I think, he ad ds, that a
pl-Ltrecer· idea thoan thiJ of Liberty an~d Sl~avery·
cazn be form~ed.

I am under the necelfity, however, of

owning, that this idea is somewhat per-
plexing to rne. It does n~ot appear, that
upon this idea ·of Liberty any civil com-
munity can be formed without introdu-
cing; iavery. For even where the clol-
le~tive body are sovereigns, they are ·Cfe-
domn unamimous, and the minority muff-
ever fabmit to a power that stands oppos~ed
to their own will.

In this, howrever, the loss of Lib rty

may be suPPos~ed unavoidable, for it is
common to iFayu, that men, by entering
into faciety, give up a part of their Natural
Liberty.

But there is yet another difficulty. If

Liberty be oppoled to Restraint, I am
afraid it is inconsistent with the great end

ofcivil government itifelf, which is to give
people security from the effeA of crimes
and diforrers, and to preserve the peace
of maankind.

The Liberty of any limgle man, in this

sense of a freedom from reffraint, would

Ah 3 be

(6]

be the servitude of all. In Turkey, per-
h~aps in Brandenburgh, there are persons
wvho pretend to this Liberty; but I be-
Ilieve that no one can d~evice a more plen-
tiful forurce of slavery than this. The
Libertty of every separate diitridt or cor-
paration In a Rtate wou~ld be naational in-
dependence a and as far as the humourr
fogr it thould spre~ad, wyould threaten every
community with the 10fs of: every inrcor-
prati~led member that h:as a pretence for
fepraraionR, or a fancy to set up for itrelf.

I confers I am romewhat furpxrifd that

D~r. Price, who quotes Montefqluieu with

iberty another. 'That ;f any citizen were
fre~e to do wha~it he pleased, this wouald bre an
extizndon of Liberty, for ever-y one elye wouldd

If the Doctor perfit in his definition

of Civil Liberty, it will be diffcult to su~p-
port the high encomium whiich he beftows
u~pon it. For it would. be a real curie to
numbers of mankind to be left: to do what:
they. please. Certalin infi-ances we hav·e
had of thlis Liberty in the cafe of derpotic
prinlces, who were taurght to thinks that
they had a right to do what they plenafd -
bjut· they were, in consequence of thlis
Liberty, the completeit wYretches that havie
appeared in the history of mankind.

W·~hether we fay or no with Mlontei-

qluieu, that the power of the people is not
the liberty of the people, it may be said
with confidence, that the power of the
people is not the happiness of the people.
Corrupt and vicious men, alTembled in.
great bodies, cannot have a. greater curse
beffowed upon them, than that of govern-
ing themselves.

A 4 It:

It is possible that the Dodtor may have

mneant to qualify his dermnition arid the
encomium of Civil Liberty, by ffuppofing,
that it was preceded by Moral Liberty; and
if he did, this would be rather an aUkward
way of informing us, that Liberty consists
in the freedom to do what is juff and
innocent. In the mean time, and till
M~oral Liberty is fully established in the
world, we (hall do well to prepare some
reffraint for· the inclinations of men, and
be contented with a Liberty which lecures
to us the poffeflion of our rights, while it
reffrains us from invading the rights of
others.

Here, howcver I am obliged to look

f~r'::ira fame pages (e), and must con-
fes~s, that the Do80or himself has qualified
hiis defeription of Liberty in some fiich
mnanner as this: A free fate, he says, at
Ir/the sue imre that it is free itse~lf, makes all
its mlembers free, by excluding licentiousness,
andc guardling their persons aad property ansd
good namire againJ2 jJidt. That is to f~ay,
wrhen wre bring together the two parts of
Thle Dod'or's defeription, that a free slate·

produces

(e) Page 18.

produces servitude, to produce Liberty.
Or, as he-concludes the paragraph himself,
that Gove~rnment l~~rer~ais Liberty, when~ u/e~d
to defrPoy Libert-y.

This colliflon of words, I confess, ren-

ders the precilion -of the Doaeor's former
idea somewhat irfplpcious , but we must
be contented with the good meaning, and
only regret, that the qualification of the
g~eneral definition had not come s~ooner,
and that it is not more uniformly kiept in
view through the piece. If a wri~ter
thould insist, that the inhabitants of St.
Giles's have a right :to s~eize the hloules in
GrolvenorrSquare, and after~wards, upon a
difficulty fltated, thould qlualify his doatrine
by saying, that he aflirmled the right only
on a supposition ·that they had bought the.
fubjeas in question, and hlad paid~ for
them, his doatrine might be true on thre
whole; but his manner of Rating it, by
leaving out so important a condition till it
was required to so~lve an objeation, efpe-
cially if' he dropt it, afterwards through
the whole of his argument might appear
foamewhat exceptionab~le. It is probable
th~at some of the parties concerned would:

A 5 be

[ ro ]

be in such haite to avail themselves of the
right, that they wiould- not Ray~S to think ·of
the condition. And- I apprehend wvith~
fobme regret, that thre Doaor mixy
hav·e readers w~ho will reason on his defi-
nition of Liberty, and think themselves
entritled to do what they please, without
a~ttending to the qlualification that is after-
:erwards brought to explain it.

My impatience to· have a fatisfadory

account of this important f~ilbjea, by coll
latin~g together the deferiptions and limi-
rations of my Aiuthor, has carried me a
few pages too faf1; I thrink myself now,
hlowever,, authorised to conclude with the
conse~nt of the Doator, that Civil Liberty
is not precis~ely a power to do· what wve
pl!eaTe, but the recur-ity of our rights; and
that a person1 may be free, although con-
tr·ary to his ow~n will he is obliged to pay
hIs debts, and even to contribute to the,
revenue of the faste. And if the Do~tor:
insists that Liberty still implies a freedom
from reffraint, he will please, to observe,
that nothing can give a more compltete
freedom from unjust restraint, than the
perfedt Cecurity that we cannot be wronged: TChis

This is the freedom which M/ontelquieu
h~olds forth to our efleem; and I presume,
it is that Liberty on which Dr. Price be-
flows encomium, notwithflanding his ap-
parent: partiality to the freedom of doiner
what we please. I now return to the place
at which I met my Author (fl).

The Do~tor, in every flep of his argu-

ment, is - fmewhat hurried by his own
definition. In e~ver-y free fate, he says, ever-y
mana i., his owen legriflator- : ll tax~es ar-e free~
gifrs for; pub~licServices. It may be fair to
alk -in what part of- the world su~ch a slate
does, or ever.did exist. ? Or. what fort of
lawts thieves and pickrpockets· are lik~ely to
make againf1 theft ?- Or how much of~
his property the miser is likely to bring; to
the coffers of the Public ?-

In most free slates the populace have as

muc~h need to be guarded against thle es-
se&t of their own folly and errors, as agatinft
the ururpation of any other person what-
ev·er. And the essence of political L'iberty
is luch an eftablilhment as gives power to ·

the .

(/f) Pagce .

the wvife, and fCafety to all. The exercile
of power in popular assemblies has a m~ix-
ture of effeas, good and bad. .It teaches
a people, as it did the Athenians, to be-
come wits, critics, and orators. It gives
to every man one chance against being
oppressed, in allowing him to appear for
hims~elf. But it places him when acculed
before rath, precipitate, prejudiced, and
ineqluitable judges; he is no more liis
own legislator, than ·he is thle rmatter of
the people. And he is in fadt fubjeR to
at power, which is of all others the most
unfl-able, capricious, and arbitrary : bound
by no law, and fubjeA to no appeal.
For this reason, Mr. ~Montesquieu has
very wifely said, that Democracy and

.~ Ariffocracy are not by their nature free

gove~rnments (g).

They are inferior in this refped to cer-

tain s~peci~es of ·monarchy, where law is
mor~e fixed and the abules of power are
better restrained.

The Dodtor farther oblerv~es (b), or

concludes, from his definition, thEat Civil

Librlty

Ll'berty in the mzo# perfect degree can be en-
joye'd onzly ia~n/ml fts, ~whre every memnber·
is carpable of giving his fufrage in person, anrd
of being chafen into public offices. It is
true that democracy is tolerable only in
[mnall stat~es , and ·the Dodtor certainly
means to speak of democracy, when he
makes th~is inference on the fabjeat of Li-
berty. But ·ev~en in the smallest slates,
the pres~ervation of public con-iffency and
justice, the security of private rights, muff
ever recommend some mixture of arifto-
cratical power, that may prove a check
on the caprice of the people; and fiich a
mixture tooke place in all the happiest in-
flitutions of antiquity.

The Dodtor owns (i'), that although Li-

,berty be most perfedt in finall slates, it
is not altogether banithed fromn great ones:
For, wh3ere all the members of a fate are not
caZpable' of giving their fuf·ages on pucblic
men~l~ea furidividually and perfontally, theyr may
do this by the appoinrtment of fubfitut~es or
reprefentaltives.

In this concefiron, the Doiaor begins to

elude the force of.his own definition 4 and

when

(i) Page so,

[ Id4 3

when we confider how little in some cafe~s
the conflituent may know of what his
repres~entative does, It appears, that by
this device, men may be their own le-
giflators, without: so much as knowing
that laws are enaated or proposed. And
even America, at the diflance of th~ree
thousand miles of~ sea, may enjoy i~ts fr~ee-
dom by sending thbftitutes or repr~elenta-
tives to the Parliament of Great Britain;

This indeed is one of the happiest i~--

ftitutions of mankind, and· might- be of
ule in tiiall as wIell as in7 great Ratets, by
giving every order of the people that
Th~are in the legislature of their country,
wihich is necef~ary to guar-d their own
rights, without enabling them to usurp
onI the rights of others. But I mufr fli~l
contend, that the Liberty of every dlals
and order is not proportioned to the
power they enjoy, but: to the security
they have for the preservation of their
rights.

InI slating this fortunate principle how-

ever, the ~DoAor very reasonably recon~-
mends a fair and adcquate representation,
and makes fisch a defecription of pretend-

t rs I

ed inadequate reprelentation, as I am
afraid can hardly fail of being applied to
the government of Great Britain (k)-.
The reprelentatives of se~ven millions are
chosen by less than three hundred thou-
sand, and thle whole is attended with cir-
cumitances that makie the Dodor exclaiml,
it1 is an abu,/~e of languag~e to fay, tha~t fucLh
a fante p7efef Liberty. Ands thart rather·
thann be go~verlned in fuzch a manner, it wEould
perhanps be better to be gover-ned by the
wreill of One 1V~an weithout any repre/enata-

110/1.

Thle faA in our history, I believe, is

that there never entered into the head of
any) person able to bring it about, except
Oliver Cromiwell, the idea of having the
people of Great Britain reprelented. Per-
ions of a certain defe~ription were in the
w~ay of attending thle king in his wars
aInd in h~is Parliaments. It appears that
they considered this diftindcion rather as
a burden than as a privilege. The kings
were in use to grant exemptions to the
officers of their court, aInd to others. The

-counties and boroughs that sent fu~bi~i-:
tutes were obliged to give them wages 4
and fomnetimes, by thle connivance of
theriffs, eluded the duty altogether. In
process of time, hiowever, a place in the
King's Court of Parliament became of~
more cons~equence. Deputies became
wi~lling to serve without wages; boroughs
revived ·their charters. Freeholders em-
braced their diftination as a privilege, and
their reprelentatives improved it into aJ
formidable power, which became of the
greatest importanlce to themselves and to
·th~eir country. So little :howev~er are
mankind commonly aware wh~en they
are laying in politics the foundation of
the best f~uperitrudtures. The [pirit of
the constitution, the delign of th~e con-
flitution, are the mnere confirudtians of
[pecullative men; at least, -they ontly rnean
the effea of the conftitutlion, which,, not-
withstanding the difdlain of our Au~thor,
h~as been in many r~elpe~s flpe~rior to the
effeR of .acy other conflitution in th'e
known world; and neotwithf~ta-nding ·the
high .ideas of Libetrty with which it is
contrasted does .a~ually ibeffow upon its

fubjeats

[ I7 S

fub~jecds higher degrees of Liberty than
any other people are known to enjoy.

it is known, that under all the defeats

of the Britith Legislation, the fu~bjea
enjoys more ifecurity than was ever be-
fore enjoyed by any people s and this not
accidentally, but by a very natural ten-
dency of the conflitution, by lodging le-
giflation in the hands of persons interested
in .the juffrice of the laws which th·ey
make, and by g~iving to all the different
orders of the flarte a power to rejeat or
amend every law that is likely to be
grievous on themselves. It is les~s maEt-

cleae~d. For to long as no one can be
eleated without the qualifications of a
British commoner, the interests of thle
Comnmons in the lower houle are s~ecure.

The experience of Europe, Asia, and

Africa, fbould convince Dr. Price, that it:
is not better to be governed by one man
than by such a representation : but this
hasty exprefilon of the Dodtor, shews thle
danger of going so f'aft in search of ideal
perfeation, which is apt to makre us de-
rpire what is attainable and obtained, fo~r

the

[ x8 ].

the fake of something impradticable, and
sometimes absu~rd.

It is of great moment to extend the

participation of power and government,
as far as the circumflances and charader·
of a people will permit; but extremely
dangerous to confound this advantage
with Civil or Political Liberty ; for it
may often happen, that to extend the
participation of power, is to destroy Li-
berty. WThen all the powers of t-he Ro-
man senate were transferred to the popu-
lar assemblies, the Liberty of Rome camne
to an eznd.

Int ge~neral, to be free, is to be gusidd byl

one's own will l; bult licentious~ness is its orp-
popie (?) .

Dr. Price seems to forget his own de-

fmrition of ~ib~erty, and admits the re-
fitraint of crimes as necessary to it : nay,
admits that Liberty is not less infringed
when the licentious multitude do what
they pleare, than it is when a single per-
fTon does 10 a although he seems to think,
and perhaps juffly, that the former in-

fringemen-t

fri~jfngement is thep most7 repairalerhl and~ the
least pernicious of the two, p. I4*

Dr. Pri~ce has very juffly oblerved, that

the imputation of omnipotence to any
govrernment, except that of the flrongeft,
the most: numerous, or the greatest force,
is bfurd; and that even force cannot
ralways iecuctre obecdience. It must be fk~-
tisc~ed with the alternative of obedience,
of tortures, or of death. Government,
whiatever be its origin, must~ employ var-
rious engines, of which force fs b~ut one;
authority, refipedt, public confidence, per-
~liation, are the principal e~ngines to be

ing and innocent people : Force is the en-
gine to be employed against criminais
an:d flavres. And th~e government of mere
force,~ in every instance, either finds peo-
ple slaves, or makes them so.

It is absurd to f~ay, as famrre writers have

said in thle courf'e of this paper-war, that
there must be in every slate one fulpreme
ulncontrolable power; for this never yet
existed i~n any slate~ whatever. The deC-
potic Prince, in search of such a power,
finds, that he changes th~e control of ad-

femblies,

[ zo :]

fiemblies, councils, civil departments, or
of men of education and virtue only, to
come under the control of Serjeants and
Corporals. In ou~r government, King,
Loards, or Commons are not one power.,
but three collateral powers; any one of
which may flop the mroiions of all the
reft. This oblervation, however, taktes
nothing from the authority -of their joint
ads wherever they concur, nor had any
one till now, from the extreme fettle-
ments of British f~ubjedts in the old world,
to their utmost migrations in the new,
doubted the validityr of any furch a~t. Dr.
Price leems to regret that the efforts for-
merly mad~e byv our fathiers in behalf of
Liberty are no longer repeated; he thould
likewise regret, that our liberties are no
longer attacked in the fame manner as in
the times of our fathers. The contest
b~etween the prerogative of thle King and
the privilege of Parliament is difcontinu-
ed: the King has influence enough in Par-
liament to obtain th~e necessary supports
of his governmenlt, though, I hope, never
to obtain the smallest resignation of the
people's right. In th~e contest of our

times,

times, the par ties are the p~retenders to
office and the holders of- office. A nroble
contest, though an ignoble caule. I muff
call it a noble conrteft·, as it is undoubtedly
one: princ3iple of life= in our confritutition.
It leads one party to wa~tch the mijotios
of adminiflration & and the other to~ be onl
their· guard becadfe they are watched.
As the matter now flands, indeed, it is
more the intere~st of apposition to flop the
ordinary movement of government, than
to prevent its labuf~es. If they can stop
the ordinary course of government, the
miniffer mufb writhdfiaw to mnake .way for·
themselves : but in preventing abuses,
they only oblige him to change ill mea-
fures for good, and by this means tol tke
a firmer hold of his power. I knrou that
many iHl consequenc-es· might be impute~d
to the flarte of our· parties; but I a~m not:
for removing any one safe-guard to free-
dom, untiE:we hve· founrd a better.

Dr. Pi-ice infers fro~m hlis argument,

thart no: one cormmunity can have; aq·
pow~er ·over th p~operty or -hgrfltiotn of ano-
ther, the bis not inzcorpora~ted w~ithb it by a jus~
andadiequate repriefentation. P. 27.

In this passage, by the word Power,

he certainly means the right to hav~e flich
a power; for it is an undoubted fa&t, that
many slates have had the power.` Even
the admired and happy republics of Swil-
fCerland and H~olland have their f~ubjeat
towns and provinces a and this nakcent
republic of New England too, if it ac-
quire the independence which, under the
denomina~tion of Liberty is projeated for
it, may come to h~ave its ~libje~t towns
and -provinces, and, among the foremost,
some of those who are now so ready to
become partners of its revolt against the
ftlate.

I do not contend for the right to any

such power in any a~tual cafe, but I con-
tend not only for the reality of the power,
but for the right likewi~e~ in~ some thp-
posable cafes. No writer on the law of'
nature, that I krnow of, has denied that
itates or bodies politic may perform every
aat that any private party can perform;
and if this,be admitted, it follows, that
they may, either by contrea~ or forfei-
ture, become tr~ibutary or fubjeat,to ano-
ther slate or body politic, as much as a

single

single mani may become the fe~rvanlt or
debtor of another single man by flipula-
tion or forfeiture.

Thi-s maxim of the law of nature, I

confers, d~oes not bind the Americans to
contribute to the thpply of the Britilh
Empire, unless it can be thewn that they
have received all the benefit of fubje(5s;
and therefore have fitpulated to perform
all the duties of fabjeats, by the fame tacit
convention that binds every inhabitant: of
Great Britain.

I agree with the Dodtor, that the firb-

jedion of one slate to another is inexpedi-
ent, and often calamitous for both; but
this will not preclude one member of the
fame slate, who has always made common
caure, with another, from having a very
just claim to exped a joint contribution
to the common support.

After what has passed between Great

Britain and her Colonies, whoever pre-
tends that Great Britain thould drop every
claim of a return, and the Colonies refuse
to make any return, under every poflible
security to their property, rnuff have very
high notions of the generosity incumbent

g~r rvrrvruon

[: 24 3

on the one party, and as low notions of
wh~a~t is inlcumbent on the other. N~ay,
but they have traded with us, and this is
enough: and have not wei traded with
them ? Have they given us their goods
for nothing ? Or have they beeni careful
to receive valuie ? Or have they tak~en less
value than other nations would have
taken ? There quleftions thould be an-
[wvered before: wje are~ told thajt their trade
has repaid us- for all the blood· a'nd trea-
s~ure we have expended in the cornrori
caus~e, and before it can be· admitted' that
in the heights of p~rosperity, dt which
they may arriv'e, they are not bound
under any form, or with any ~r~ecautions,
for the remainder of thieir' prop~erty, to
contribuzte any part' of it wha~tever to the
cornron up'plies of the~ Eritpire.

The Dodtor owns that onel slate may

becom~e bound to indemnify anlother for
an injury done them·, or be biotnd to~ give
s~ecurity ag~ainkt future inljury ; but wlho
cani fbt limnits- to the pofibe ri~gh'ts thus
effetb~lifhed ini the chairh of' one (fate
agiainft another ? It is im~possible to te'll
how long a state mray be tribt~itary, art

how

[: 25 -1

hlow much it may~ pay before it h~as ac-
quitted a deb't of' indemnification ; or
what precaution rnay be necessary to ob-
tain, for the future, a fufficient security
against injuries. The Romans, wheni
they recovered Campania from its revolted
inhabitants, and from Hannibal, thlought
proper, for their own future security·, to
abolish the Municipal Senate, and affem-
blies of that province: Such meetings
they considered as a standing conspiracy
against themselves. In this I thall not
pretend to juffify their conduA, but Aup-
poitcions may be made that would be
fufficient to justify it, and su~ch as I 'hall
neither be willing to make nor apply to
the American Colonies: But let no one
contend, that in the plenitude of mad-
ners, they may not forfeit: more to the
slate, than any one would be willing to
exadt from them. I will not fay wh~at an
imperious slate, like that of the Romans,
10 often quoted in a similar cafe, would
have exadted and done; but if we are to
hope that one party will not infliat the
penalty, we may hope likewise that the
other will not incur it.

Wlriters on thle Law of Nature sustain

the v·alid ity of a fair contradt in all cafes
wh·~ere thec performance is poif~ble and law-
fuli. That~r it is both pomlble and lawfuil
for on~e corporation or body politic to s~ub-
mit themnialvesc to thie laws, and: contri-
bute to the Appl3ies of another, nlo one
w~ill doubt -, that all corporations and bo-
dies politic belonging to the fame slate
a~re ad'ually under ~such a contra&t, no
body ever qlueftioned'.

religious opinions of another, becaule his

bindl himferlf, if he pleales, to pay a shill-
ingS in thes pound of hiis estate.

But can o~ne generation bind another ?

No doub:, in every lawf~ul contradt, as
much~i as anly person can bind h~is heirs,
or: as m-~uch as th~e late K~ing of France
coulld~fbind the fuccceffors to hiis crown to

likThe Dodtor's reasoning on thiis

bfabjeC; takecs away the obligation of trea-
ties, or aIt best mak~es them temporary
aigreemlents, to last for the liv-es of those:
whio ma~de them~.

It is confeff~ed, thrat ~favours v-olumarkr

conferred, cannot be slated as a rwounird
of debt; but they who reft to mluchi onl
the affection and attachiment of th7e Colo-
nies to the Mother Country, oug;ht to al-
low something for the favours done by
the Mother Country to her Colonies.

The Doacir attem1pts a diftin~tion be-

tween the separation of parts in the fame
k~ingdom, and the ieparation ofC part~s in
the fame empire, whlich I confes~s I cannot
comnprehend; but if he lays so g~reat a
firers on the difference of names, hle may
be told, that Great-Britain and it-s depen-
dencies is not an empire, but a kringdom.
I fee no warrantable part for mankind to
adt under either denomnination, but to ac-
qu~icei~ in thle government which Provi-
dence has given to their kingdom or their
empire, until they are sure that th~ey do
not change it for the worse; and in this,
reformers upon gener-al principle, hlow--
ever iFanguine, are far from being fe'-
cure.

It is thle faflhion, however, I oblerve,

with s~ome writers, to give high expedta-
tions of the great perfedtion to which

B 2 human

[ >8 ]

human nature is tending, especially in
America; for I think Old England, by
their account, is degenerating. But a re-
.public extending rzoo miles in one direc-
tion, and without any known bounds in
the other, is still an experiment to be
made in the history of mankind. Our
anceffors made the experiment~ in vain,
within narrower limits, they too had high
expe~tations of what mankind were about
to exhibit, they thought the millennium
and the kingdom ·of Christ were at hand,
but they found, in their flead, the iron
reign of an dfurper, furpported by military
force. It ·is ch~arity, perhaps, to pray that
if the Colonies must break. with us for
ever, they may be more faithfully served
by th~ose they employ, than they themn-
s~elves have served thieir country. The
officer, perhaps, has not yet appeared,
wvho, on that emergency, is to dismiss the
Congress as Cromwell did the Parliament.
·But what title have they to hope for an
exemption from the too common fate of
mankind; the fate that has ever attended
Democracies attempted on too large a
fecale a that of plunging at once into raili-

tary

1 29 ]

tary government ?The armies thley forml
against their country will need no othrer
title to become thei~r masters. It is rteven
fair to con~clud~e, from the hiffory of the
world, that there Ks no· time o~f mocre dan-:
ger than thlofe times of sanguine, of florid,
and enthufidftic expedtation, in wh~ichl
mankind are bent on great anld hazardous
change.

Americans, however, may still be·

thought out of this qlueftion a they seek
no innovation ; they are the parties that
contend for the ancient eftabjifhment.
Their plea, however, I hope, is better
founded than this (pr). The Parliament
of Great-Britain has made law~s for the
Colonies from their frirt eftablilhlments.
The charters of the Colonies ilbjeated
them to taxes, and they have been taxed
by AdSs of the British Parliament: Mat-
ters therefore were in their ordinary tr-ain,
when the Americans flopt thort, and would
proceed no farther.. I will not, however,
insist, that the change of circumitances

ma~y not have required a change of policy ;
anid ;hat, as thle Americans are growing:
rich;, a-nd hav-e something that tempts rapa-
c~it-, they ought to have better s~ecurity for
i!heir property·, than the continuance of
iiorme;r prod'tice will perhiaps beffow. But,
In1 thil view of thle contest, what is to be
don-e ;i the Colonies have a righ~t to con-
tend for~t new fecuarities~ ? Let them appyi
:·' thec slate with proper profeflions of
'iuty, and~ reprclentations of the dangers
~ihey appreh~ended a but no one can pre-

tend tat the slate ought to yield up the

ordinary wtay of confitunting a revenue,
till a ~new and better way is fulbfituted ina
its place.

Th'le Docdor r~efers to the example of

thle Rom3!ns, and bids us confider how
!:chii theiy filibred for having been th~e
ts rantS o~f' thtier nations, and 1 thall never
!-econ send=r~c to, any slate to follow their
t~S!idi pe.t

leading principle, vriz. that every ref-rantn

seem to him incapable of being difpurted.
There is, indeed, nothiing thiat requirecs to
be djIlputed, but his principle itfdIf, for
wsith th~at, the conse~quences mut~ fall.
Its application, as h~e ob~serv~es, to thec pre-
lent question w·ith Amenricn, is obviou.s;
and thec principle indeed seem1-s to be made!I
for the' application, and is futted to justify
the desir:e of naitional independence, unde~lcr
the name of Civ·il Libelrty. Tlhe change~;
of words has a mighty efea~~, even in1 the
frame of an argumnent, There is not ane
English gentleman, I believe, that wouldl
not thrink from the thought of' reducin~g
mniions of'his fellow-fulbjeats to a slate of
servitude, and as few th~at will not be
seized with indignation in being told that
th~e Colonies aim at independence, and
will contribute no longer to· the joint sup-
port of their comm~on country.

19e (hall be told, however, that the

Colonies do not aim at independence.--
Yes, if they aim at th~e Liber ty de-
signed for them by Dr. Price. If they
aim only at security to their rights andl
properties, let the queion be fairly

B 4F fb;ted,

slated, and put in the train of pacific:
dilcui~ion.

TPhe Dodtor is pleased to iay, that the

question of right, with all liberal inquirers,
ought to be; not whtat jurif~di~tion over
them, precedents, statutes, and charters
give, but what reason and equity, and
. the rights of humanity give: This, he

thys, i'n tr~uth, is a6 quefionbl wehich no kingldom
has ever had occaJion to agitate. · It is cer-
tainly the first time it ever was proposed
that men having any political eftablith-
ryoents, fltatutes, prtecedents, or charters,
thould at once demolish, cancel, or set
aside all the maxims, records, or convenr-
tions, on which every party must -rely for
the pres~ervation of his property, and from
w·hich~ alone hre can learn the relation in
wh(tich he flands to the slate, or to his
fetllow-fidojefts. Why has no kingdom
ever had olccallon to agitate s~uch a quef-
tion~ ?Have no parties arol~e in politics
before ? Have no diithifts or corporations
of the thme community claimed privileges
and exemptions that have been dis~puted
withi theml ?It is w·ell knowYn that itrchl
quefiocns h~ave been agitated, and that

pa rtles

[ 33 j

parties uniformly referred to precedents,
statutes, and chiarters for a determination.
To bring questions of this fort to any sap-
posed tribunal of reason, of equity, and
humanity, is to set human affairs afloat
upon the few of opinion and private in-
terest, and to-deprive men of thos~e charts,
landmarks, and rules of failing, by whichi
they were in de~ to be guided, and to di-
re61 their caule.

It is certainly true, that no. nation ever

planted Colonies with so liberal or t~o
noble a hand as England has done. But
the h~as done so on the plan of those very
charters, statutes, and precedents which
are now to be l~et aside. And her havince
done so much for her Colonies,, is th~rely
an unfavourable topic f~rom whlich to infer.
the right: of hler Colonies to do nothing:
for her. It is indeed· to be lamented,
th~at, in the place of argument, this con-
troverily is hasteningS to. employ the. sword.
$leffed. were he that coulldl bring it to a
a different issue.. &xut I hope,. that nei--
ther the Amnerica~ns, nor the advocates
that plead for them,. will think, -that every.
concellion thould come from Great-Br~itain.

They have hitherto fanid to the King of
G~reat-Britain, on hI;s own territory, as the
Romans said to Pyrrhlus and to Hannibal,
"' You mnuft evacuate thiis land before we
will. treat," and if this were granted them,
it is lik~ely they would be ready to de-
clare whIat fulrthler concessions threy exped

the ~juffice of~ the war by the objeQ of it s

gentlemen, who are. thie declared friends
o;f America, and in whose intentions the
Amrericans repole luch confidence, that
thzey hiave never once, as i have been
told, complained of this declaratory law.
From this itate of the care, that is, fromt
the filetnce of America on this law, and
from the friendly intentions towadrds
America of' those who obtained it, I am
inclined to think, that .this law cannot be
the ground of the quarrel. I rather ful~

tion and pr~operty, than~i abou)t ipecu~lativ7 e
declarations of righit; and thant o~ne party
is very indiffetrent about laws tha~t are to
bring them nothing, and others about laws
that are to takte nothing friom thecm. And
on this fuppofu~ion I thould think, the fair
way of determining the jufitie of th~e
claim-, would be by itating two quefio~ns.
The first, Whiether thle charters, f;lutues,
and precedents;~ that is to ilay, wheither
the prese~nt constitution of Great-Blritain
refpe~ting her Colonies; h~as comnmitted
a power of Taxation over· Am~erica, to
the legislature of Great-Britain. If this
qlueffion shall be. decided in the affirm-a-
tive, as I am pe~rsuaded it rnuft be so d~e-
cided, it will f~ollow, that the legifiature
o~f Great-Britain. has yet incurred no blame
m, urging a claim in wh~ich they were jul-
tified by the conrcitution of the f ;ate.

I hiowever most w-illingly admit a fe-

conld queff-ion. Has the fitualtion of aif-
fairis undlergone any channge of policy and
of meduiires, that deserve thie attentiork of
the Legislature, and on. which thle Colo-
nlies ought to be heard with candour and·
p~atience, so, as to avoid, if pof-~ble, inco~n--

~erndences·

E 36 31

ve~nien~ces to whlichI, in a new fltuation,
old precedents, and even statutes and
charter~s mIghat carry; us?

Thes principal changes in our~ circum-

flances are, that our Colonies, under the
influence of charters and statutes,. have-
increased in resources and in people: that
Great-Britain is heavi~ly burdened, and
that now, from. being at an ordinary ex-
pence in nursing and protesting her Colo-
nies, the would gladly dr~aw some share:
of the public fulppies from thence. This
ficuation, I confe~ss, is new, and may re-
quire some suita.ble policy. If the Parlia-
ment of Great-Britain, as formerly, be to
grant the money of the Amer~icans; the
lhtcter may think their property not s~ecure.
At the fine time, if any party indepen-
dent of the Parliament of Great-Britain be
to grant m-oney to the Crown a this con-
flitution lores one of its principal f~ecuri-
ties, the dependence of the Crown for
Aippies on the Obmmons of Great-Bri-
tamn.

Here is a difficulty, on which it is not

surprising that parties thould differ, and
inadvertently get into a. very hearty qluar-

r e1,

C 37 1'

rel, in which both may fuffer extremely
b~efore any one is able to find a solution.

In slating the qluefion, I have passed

over many things- whch· other perlons
may think of great consequence, in order
to come at what I apprehend every one
else wiH1 think so.

I do not write in order~ to. perfitad~e my

correspondent, that: the Legislature of
Great Britain thosuld retain their unlimited;
power of granting the money of Almerica.
But I write under a deep convi~tion, that
the Americans oulght to contribu~te to the
111pplies of the empire. And that they
ought now, before an indemnity is granted
for the past, to ipecif~y the taxes on· which
they will eftabliih. a. revenue for the slate,.
and which, withoult augmenting the bur-
den on- them, may increal'e with their re-
sources, their populabtion, and the immu-
Rities given to their trade; but ilbjeft to,
no other alteraltion, without the cons~ent of
Parliament and their ownn. Or if they:
choose rather to pay fam~e fixed propor~-
tion of what the Commons of Great-Bri-
tain from time to time~levy on.themfelves,

E as J

let them have it in the mode which they
themselves, or better judgments than mine,
can determine.

Thley have been told, thiat the Parlia-

mnent of Great-Britain will not tax them,
if thley are pleased to tax themfrelves. No
s~pecific tax, no specific fum has been men-
tione~d to them: and yet this propolition,
coming ~from thle Commnons of Great-
Britain, has, by themselves and by their
advocates on this fide thle water, been
termed an insult. Thle plain English, I
am afr~aid, is, that the Americans do not
think~ any fuipply f~romn thence due to the
slate of Great-Britain. Or, that their ad-
vocates do not think; they oughlt to g~rant
any Riich fiuppliy till they th~emselves are in
power. The Amer~icans may]i flatter thlem-
felvesr, thrat if thle party that now oppoles
Governmient, were in powe7r, they would
obtain every fav~our an~d every conce'i~on~.
But they may be allitred, that no. M!/iniffer
in the councils of thle K~ing will fdurrender
the undoubted righ~t of thiis country, to
reqluire from ALmerica so~me share in th~e
fiuppies which are necefT~3ry to fispport the
Imperial Crown and the Empire of Great-

Britain.

Britain. If precautions be wanting to fe-
cure the rights of that people in the mode
of attaining this necessary end, the parties
may flill hav-e an opportuniry of entering
int~o a~ candid and fair: dif~cuflion of this
ibbjedt. Commnifioners are soon to be ap-
pointed by the King, whio are to acconi-
pany his fleets and asrmfies across the At-
lantic, doubtless with the humane and
mIerci~ld intention to spare, by pacific
means, if that is yet poflible, the effufion
of blood.

In this light the Colonies ought certainly

to, confider this lenient mneafure. And if'
they do, I think~ they ought to be ready
on their part, to meet ~the ad~vance~s of the
King with dutiful reprelentations of the
!`ecurities they deem7 necessary in thle fu-
ture adminiffration of government ref~pec-
ting them.-Ilf no fuchd flep is taken, we
mnay fairly conclude, that they are intoxi-
cated with the idea of s~eparation and in-
dependence, and th~at they are resolved
not to grant supplies in any mode or in
any proportion whatever. And if this.
be their resolution, I am afraid the iiword
must firikre as well as be raised, and till

they

[ 40 ]

they exculpate themselves from the defigrs
of withdrawing their allegiance, and every
reasonable mode of Aipply frorn the Crown
of Great-Britain, the wounds they receive
will appear to come from the hand of Jul-
tice, and will remain unpitied by many
perfone, who are far from withing. to in-
vade their liberties.

It is· likely that the Councils of the·

King will incur more cefu-re for the re-
luacance with which they have armed the
kingdom against this revolt, than th~ey will~
f~or any fhippofed precipitation in urging:
miatters to extremlities. Bu~t it is a nobic
error to have been flow in believing that
British fubjeas, unmolefied. in their r eli-
gion or in. their liberties-, still in poffeflion
of that government by which they h-ad
arrived at so much pr-osperity, untouchedl
in their property by an unprecedented in-
vafionI; and if assailed, only afa~iled by
penal st~atutes, to make compensation for an
outrage done to the property and the trade
of their: fellow-fubje~ts: It w~as,-l I fy, a
noble error to be flow in believing that
British fu~bjeats, under this description,
wirould have drawn u~pon- themselves and~

this

t 4· 3

this nation all the horrors of a civIll war.
If we were taught to think them pufilani-
rnous, they were certainly taught to think
our councils irresolute, diftraated, and
unitable a but both, I hope, will return
from their errors, and exchange the sword
for a more rational mode of arbitration.

Dr. Price, being to confider the Juffice

of the war, recites al~l the pleas that may
be offered by the slate in support of cocr-
cive measures. Thof'e pleas he fuppoles
to be, 'The nec~efity olf wrear to preser-ve the
utnity of the empire8 : our superiority : our pre-
ten/ions as the pazrent fate : the return due
for~ our benaefts : oulr Joverei~gnaty in the terri-
tory ofAmerica. The Dodtor will own,
that union is at least a defitable objeat, and
will pardon our endeavoursto preserve it,
by the Fadme means that slates, the most
moderate, have employed for this pur-
pole; the policy of a common interest, a
common sense of duty, and the authority
of a common government. If any one
contend, that we ought to rely on either
of the former principles to~ the exclusion
of the latter, and that we ought to re-
sign either the authority or the force which

go vernmeat~

C 42 1

government on occaflon muir exert, I
thould fulpe~t that he does not with to
have urs uinited, nor even to leave us pof-
Tell~d of the common resou~rces for the
preservation of peace and good order, that
all nations have employed within their
depenidencies.

I mlean not to argue from th~e lecond

topic. Nations do, not fouind obligaations
of allegiance and duty on difference of
wealth, numbers of people, or the sup-
posed precedency of scholars and learned
men. I hope the remaining title, how-
ever, will not be to slightly treated.
The name of Parent State is not an emTpty
found. It carries the authority by wThich
civil rig~hts are eftabljihed and modified.
If Amnerica'derive nothing from this aui-
thority, why did its settlers take any~
charters from the crown of Great-Britain?
Or if they were emancipated by ther~e
charters, why is not their emancipanion
expressed in some such terms as the fol-
lowing? I~he~res cer-tain persons menan to
de'part this our kingdom azd for-m fatles apart,
we ereb~~-ly emancipate fulch persons, dy7chla ge
theirT allegiance to us, and dycontsinue our pr-o-

tenrc l on

i 43

;edon.If, on the contr~ary, they tooki

pff1etlion of their fettlemnents by grants
oif thie Crown, if they have been uniform-
ly considered as B~ritiih futbjeAs, amenable
to thle lawv and under thle proteation of the
sl-ate, what title h~ave thecy now to with-
draw thleir allegiance because their fe~ttle-
m~ents were mnade in America, any more
than if they haRd been on· Hounflow-Heath
orr on Finchley-Common ? The charters,
the precedents, the Rtatuites on wM~hich this
right of the Aate is founded, can no more
be disputed than the charters, precedents,
anrd ta~tutes on which th~e conflitution of
thne Rtate, refpedting any other part of its
power, is eitabliihed. The utmnot any
party can plead is, that circumi~ances are
-hanged, and require a new fytiem of
p~olicy, or at leait some additional ·pre-
cautions, to give to the British fu~bjedts of
AImerica the fatme s~ecurity, or a s~ecurity
as n~early as possible the ifamne, with that
which is enjoyed by their fellow-fubjeats
aIt home.

ExaAion of gratitude is but an ungra-

cious plea; the faA is, that the R~ate pro-
rctedd and encouraged that part of her

fu~bjeats

C 44 1

fulbjeas on the fame mixed motives of
political interest and affeAion, that the
proteats and encourages every other mem-
ber of thle community, and there is no
other member that has not an equal title
to rejeat the claim of gratitude. It may
again be repeated, that considering what
has passed between Great Britain and her
Colonies, the Americans will be found to
aat an odious part in this contest ; they are
not satisfied with the enjoyment of their
municipal governments, and such a mode
contributing to the supplies of the ern-
pire, as may be confdftent with the safety
of their persons and their properties.

The lovereignty of a territory, and

the property of its land, every where ad-
mits of a diftinflion. TShe slate is un-
dou~btedly for~ereign of all the territory on
which any of hzer thbjeds, under her pro-
tedion-, and by hfer charters· and grants,
have made any lettlements; and the ter-
ri~tory of North America was, and is fulb-
jeat to all the claims of sovereignty under
the limitation of statutes and charters.
I write from memory, but appeal to the

original

C 45 1

original deeds, whlether fCome of them
did not give an exemption from Taxation
during a limrited time, with an evident
implication, that at the expiration of that
term they should be fubje~t to taxation
like other Britith fubjedts. And whether
others did not limit taxation to specific
duties, mentioned with a like implication,
that the right of taxation was entire
while the exercise: of that <righrt was re-
firidted .

But Dr. Price is willing to plead (p) that

the Colonies did lettle under thle faith of
charters, and ive must admit, that they
have a right to all the unmum ties and
exemptions granted them by flatute, or
by charter under the authority of flatute;
but let not their advocates plead the
authority of charters in one page and
rqled them m the next. It is certain, that
the colonies were planted on the autho-
rity of law, and ne~ver aspired to eftablilfh
their privilege on a higher base. It is
likewise probable, that all of them, at
their first Iettlement, would have embra-
ced, as an ample security of their pro-

(P J P. ss, 56.

[ 46 ]

perty, an exremption from every burden
besides that of parliamentary taxation.
H~ow far this le~curity may now be deemed
f~ufficient, I am willing to leave as a faib-
jea of better and more able~dilcumion.

The remainder of D~r. Price's oblerva-

tions on the juff~ice of the war tend to
prove, th~at the' past or prelent Rlate of the
conflitution refpeating th~e Colonies, is
not precisely-- what it ought to be in
thle event of farther changes, of which he
hlas Rtated the possible contingency; and,
in this I do not pretend to decide, but
hope that pers~ons better qualified will
blring it to proper trial, not of force, but
of political expediency and national wvif
domn.

irate, thle Legislature of Great Britain is
is in poffemion of a right to impole taxes
and enna laws binding in America ? If
they be in poffeflion of s~uch a right,
hiave they been known to abule it ?' They
hlave been in poffefliion of the right, and
fearcely at all exerted it. But the A~me-
ricans are now alarmed, and think that
th~is right may' be abul~ed; let them for-
ward, therefore, and urge the precauti-
ons necessary to be takien against this
abuf e. If they w ill accept of no fcurity
below that of independency, and total
separation of comnmonwYealth , this, I ap-
prehend, they mufl: acquire at the point
of thle sw~ord. But other and better re-
mediies for the evil may yet be expeded
from the councils of a slate that has been
as remarkable for moderation, as for re-
solution in the conduat of great affairs.

Advocates in this cause perpetually

quote the spirit and principles of the Bri-
'ihl conflitution against the letter and the
fact. Do they mean its primseval slate,
the intention of its founder, or something
elle, that they ~fa~ncy concerning it ? Its
pnimaeval state is very little known, and

[: 43 ]

if it were, could not be admitted as the
proceeding in opposition to su~bsequent
establishments and compaas. In that
flage which is called th~e feudal conftituti-
on, the King has his domain or royal
eflate, and had no other- claim on his sub-
jeas but their personal services in his
wars. Whlen he wanted s~ome extraordi-
nary Aipply, he summoned his vassals to-
gether, and made his proposition to thern
for that purpoife ; they deliberated and re-
fused, or granted sometimes in commuta-
tion for military services, and sometimes
as a voluntary gift. The constitution was
·gradually raiied upon there foundations.
TShe Parliament became what it is, and
the state in poffeflion of a maxim, that
the King: can rais~e no supplies without
consent iof Parliament. This is the ori-
gin, and this is the faR in our conflituti-
on; and right or wrong, till within there
few years, or few months, within the B~ri-
tilh territory of Europe, Asia, Africa,
and America, Parliament was supposed
omnnipotent and irresistible: what change
mayr now be made to accommodate founs
to new lituations, I hope may still be de-

termined

II 49 1

termined by a better decision than that of
the sword. But, till that is determined
I hope, that every good fubjea will pay a
proper refp~ed to the fadt, and the letter
of the conflitution, what ever fancy he
may have about the spirit of it. WVe may
with for improvemenlts in the laws of- thle
slate, but till there are made, we must
abide by the law as it stands.

In the next Se~tion (q), Dr. Price

brings in queffion the policy of the war
with America. There is, in fadt, no apo-
logy can be made for any war, besides the
necessity of it to maintain some right, and
some right that is worth contending for at
this expence. Whlether Great Britain
has any such right now at flake, and by
what fleps this right came to be brought
in hazard, are two separate qlueftions.

I muff maintain, that until our union is

legally dissolved, the American Colonies
are a part of the Brititlh empire. That
adts of sovereignty, from which great
Britain might, or did derive, material ad-
vantage, were exerted by the -legislature

C

[f So ]

of Great -Britain. Tlhat the adt of navi-
gation, the a~ts limiting trade, the a~p-
pointm~ent of governors and other civil
officers, the eftablilhment of a revenue,
however inconsiderable, were all of them
aats of sovereignty, in which the slate
and people of Great Britain are deeply
interefied. T~hat the interest cif Great
Britain, conflituted by th~ere aars of so-
vereignty, is now in imminent hazard,
and in all human probability, to be fe-
cured by that force alone with which the
state thall appear to be armed in thlpport
of its own rights. So much has been
s~aid for the Americans in this country,
and they have met with so little control in
in their own, that their pretenflons are
-likely to rife. If they prevail ·by force in
reducing -the power of legislation, will they
not take the f~ame opportunity to reduce
the navigation ad, and every other right
of lovereignty ? What is to h'inder their
proceeding to affame that ·independency,
which -is ~so roundly prefe~ribed to thern
under the denomination of Liberty ?Are
they ·not gletting fa~st into a situation, in
~which the sovereignty of the Crown as

likely

C 5-e ]

likely to become as: odious, at leait to
their leaders, as the power of the Legifla-
ture itlelf ?One man is brought from be-
hind the counter, to be member of a so-
vereign Congrefa; another to be one of
five that wield the executive power of a
great empire: others are promoted pro-
portionally, though to- inferior Rtations;
and may erxtertain hopes of rising, to the
hligheft: one man is raised from a dealer
in horses to be a general, another from a
barber to be a colonel; all of them, I
make no doubt, well qualified for the
flations-they fill: but whether they be or
no, likely to be fond of their dignities,
and unwilling to part with them; ready to
emnploy- all their authority, all their cre-
dit, all the force they can command to
prevent the return of peace, which must
bring the downfal of their power, and
fend them again to their trades and their
obscurity; what but a proper force, and a
proper afpeft ofdetermination, on the part
of Great-Britain, can bring such persons as
there to reason, or deliver out of their hands
thie bulk of the s~ober and the induffri-
ouls people of America ? who, feeing their

Ct 2 roperties

[ s2 ]

properties and their peace at flake, will
be glad to: return to the boforn of the
slate, and be happy to receive fuceh fatis-
fadion on the future security of their pro-
perty and civil rights, as I hope no gene-
rous or.candid mi nd can entertain any idea
of ref~using them.

Men are indeed, as Dr. Price observes,

too apt to be governed by the lust of
power, by revenge, and by other detest-
able paflions. But are ther~e patirons un-
known in America ? Have the leaders in
this revolt no ambition, no revenge to
gratify, or would it be prudent in any ad-
miniffration to trufit to thie moderation
and candor of parties, who have soared
already to high above the condition of
f~ubjeats, and who have s~uch an interest in
perpetuating a breach to which they owe
to much personal conseq~uence

It may be .confeffed, that as matters

now fland, the Amerlcaris are not likely
to acknowledge the most evident rights of
Great-Britain, farther than those rights are
futpported by force.

But it will be asked, How came we into

this situation ? Is not the war, though ne-

ceffary

1 53 1

ceffary now, the sequel of many unnecef~-
fary steps, that being dis~continued in time,
woulld have prevented it entirely ?It mnay
be so, and so have been the greater num-
ber of w~ars that have af~fiated mankind.
Disputes aris~e, provocations become reci-
procal, and evils acc~umu~late. The be.-
ginnings are admitted, because no body
perceives the end; and every f~ool is a
wife man after the event hias thown him
what was coming.

I amn willing to own, that Dr. Price is

inclined to centure mneafhres, rather than
to fkrike at men. That for this purpole
he recals to our memory, the policy of
many years, fraught· with inftruiaion to-
those who are now to adt on the rcene of
public affairs. He prediats, though I hope
ralhly, the los~s of America; and to make
us i'enfble how much we' are to lose, he
paints in the most favourable colours,~ the
happy slate at which that country at the
beginning of ther~e hostilities had arrived,
and the growing importance of its trade
to Great-Britain. I ho e,however, it will.
be remembered, that thie Colonies arrived·
at· this happy state under the influence of

C 3 British

British policy, and under the undisputed
right of the British Legislature -to bind
threm in all cafCes whatsoever : and as we
have to long prospered together, under
this policy; that the Dorftor's predidlion
may [till prove falf'e that a moderalte
thare of public ifpirit and$ good intent~ion,
on that fide of the water as well as on this,
mnay still save to all parties their reciprocal
advantarges, withou~t incurring the incon-
venience that either apprehends. But ~for
this, purpole, as we are perpetually alarmed
wvith the hundreds of thourands that the
Americans. can arm, I am afraid; that Bri-
tain must not come to the conference un-
arraed, or in a ffate to be infurlted.

I write in every page on the ifuppofition

that nega~ciation may take place s and
who0, but infernal rpirits, would ever. go to
wvar with any other intention than to ob-
tain an equitable~ peace. ·The party on
whole fide. the aversion. to treaty lies, will
be answerable for the consequence..

As for the trad~e of America, l arn ready

our own price a but unless this price was
a higher than we received from other
markets, ulnlefs it was better paid, I do
not fee why this trade is preferable to any'
other vent for our commodities. Even if
the price were higher, which I am told it
w~as not ; the flow returns of thiis ma~rket
rezndered it leifs profitable than many
othe~rs we hrave had, and itill mty· have.

But have the Americans a righlt to writh-

draw their trade froms our merchants and
manufadturers, as well as their supplies
from the slate ? If they have not, why·
thould it be s~upposed that they mean to
carry the lines of~ separation beyond the
bounds which they themselves, and their
advocates, affed ~to prefe~ribe ? Trade is
the child of interest, and will follow where
i~ts parent leads. Bu~t the r~ighlt of fove-
r~eigtity must be maintained by authority·,
adnd sometimes by force. The fu~bjedts
of Great Britain do not claim a right of
forereignty, neither. in Europe nor in A-
merica; but they exrped from each other,
and from the Americans, the reasonable
co-operation of fellow-fubjeats; and the
Rtate itself muff maintain its sovereignty in

both. If any part of the mnonarchy with-
draw its allegiance, the remainder must:
repel furch an insult with their blood.

W'e are, in this argument, threatened

with the attacks of enemies from abroad,
while we are engaged in a war with our
Colonies. But the advocates of America,
it is hoped, do not with that the 11ate of
Great-BRitain thould bow the head to
foreign nations, as well as to her own
fiibjeds. If our quarrel be momentous
and juff, we muff rupport it or perish, be
the enemy who he will. But we have
had our wars, and none of our enemies
have yet had caule to rejoice in the effedt
of their arms againit us. I am, how-
ever, inclined to believe, that this alarm,
as it is injurious to the honour of nations
with whom we are at peace on the faith
of treaties, t~o it is injurious to their saga-
city, and diifcernment of their own poli-
tical interest. What are they likely to
gain by eredting the colonies of North-
America into a power independent of
Britain ? -Will their own Colonies become
more dutiful after this example of a s~up-
posed l~u~ccesful revolt ? Or will they have

less

C 57 3:

leis to fear in behalf of their WCIeft-India
sett~lements, from this rising confederacy,
than they have from Britain ?The new
enemy will be nearer to those settlements,
and have many more advantages in Ceiz-
ing them, than the old.

Few perions are qualified to enter the-

lifts with Dr. Price, on the flibjeaE of- ac-
counts and calculations a but~ this alone

the advantage in many a conteit to forces·
luperior to our own; and the evil, though
great, by ourr Author's account, is fils-
c~eptible of a cure. It Is probably in·
order to arge this cure, that the desperate
slate of the patient is 10 rnuch explored.

could from a real one. A falf'e and
wanton alarm of fire, in a. crowided. the-
atre,. has cost ~many lives; but -they wh~o
alarm us to loudly on the fubjeft of public
credit, may have the consolation to know,
that their own accounts are not fully cre-·
dited, other wifre we thould. have. thle peo-
ple of England· crowding into every~ ave-
nue that leads to the Bank, and; treading
ealch other to death, with an eager haste
to get forward while any cash was to be
h~ad for their papfer.

Moss people, h~owever-, believe, thart

it is not: necess~ary for a great kijngdom to
have all its riches in cath; and even the
example of the A~mericans, whose advan-
tages Dr. Price is not on the pres~ent oc-
cation. inclined· to decry, will serve to
prove, that a people, with no .better re-
source than a paper circulation, rnay ruth
ioto the midst of alarming convulflons.
The Americans have reason to believe,
that their country will be a f~eat of war,
and yet carsry on their operations withs
paper. It~ll no~tk helandingg of afew ~tr~oops

difficulties in which 'we are involvedi· thlis
does not ap~pear a, fIrolier argument to

flippoles, that thle claims of thre Rlate are
wrong, and that the resistance of the Co-
lonies is juff. On this fiippofition, the.
argument is unanlwerably for him; and
the concefflons of juffice, however late,
would, at leait to our fellow-fubjeats, be
hlonourable. But this, I humbly con-
czeive, is begging the question. Hither-
to the State has proceeded in the trad of
precedents, and followed the rules of law
and of charters. If~ a change be expedt-
ed, the grounds of it thould be laid ine
amicable representation, not in open war
and hoffility. Nations are like private
mnen, they mnay commit errors, but must
not itiffer themselves to be kicked even
into reason. When the parties are once
armed, a great nation must attend to its
r eputation, as well when it theaths as
when it employs the i-word. If thze A-
mnericans refulCe upon any terrms, whether
in conjuinC~ion with, or in su~bordination
to the Parliament of Great-Britain, to
furnifhn any part of thle fixpplies, it is by
no means necessary, in order to jufftify
t-he uf'e of the fwYord against them, that
they invade this island. If a perion re-
fuse the payment of his just debts, he

may

[T 6r J

may be compelled to do right in his own
habitation, no less than if he had aatually
entered with violence the hous~e of his cre-
ditor.

Wre are laid to aSsume as much power

over the Amiericans as either the Genoese
or the French could aflume over the Cor-
ficans. The State of Great-Britain had
aflumed nothing bult the power of pro-
ted5ing her Colonies, when her conftituti-
onal powers in America began to be de-
nied, and her authority rpurned. What
has happened since is farely matter of re-
gret, at least, if not of juftr censure, to the:
warmest friends of America. A daring
breach of peace and violence to property
was committed, and went unpunished.
Direat war has been, levied in· retu~rn for
penal statutes. And idltead of reparation
to their fellow-citizens of Boffon, we are
told, that they are an independent republic,
and no longer accountable to the laws.

'We.are bid to t~hink of the allies of the

Romans in Italy, how they claimed to be
enrolled as citizens of Rome.; how they
fought, and how the Rtate perished in the
struggle. The claim of those allies was,

b3y

% 6~23

by every reasonable person, ·thought to
be fraught with disorder and public ruin.
It was fkrenuoufly opposed· by the most
candid and virtuous citizens of Rome.
Thle multitude of the people, in the place
of an ass~embly,. but too often made a scene
of confillion. It was not: thought necef-
f~ary to bring an accession of the whole
populace of Italy to ifwell the tumult. The
event of the war was fatal to ~Rome; not
because thle claim of the allies was refafied,
as Dr. Price fCeems to insi~nu~ate, b~ut be-
cause it was granlted; and thae requel prov-
ed ·a firik~ing example of what the Doctor
does not seem to apprehen~d, th3at the
power of the people is not the good of the
people. Their liberty furnk as their power·
increas~ed, and perished- at laffr by the very
hands that were employed in Cupport- of
the popular cause.

the Dodtor means the first, I hope that:
we shall not succeed. If hie lea~ns thle fe-

Americans be adtuated by any thing thort

insinuates, to avoid embracing us once

lesson of independence, which, under the
denomination of~ Liberty he has read to·
the Americans, that they may still be
willing to remain in the bosom of the
slate, and on the fame bottorn with their
fellow-fulbjeas in Britain : But in what
fienfe, and to what effeat, remain on the
fame bottom with us Wvi~ll they acknow-
ledge the law of the slate, and contribute
some reasonable proportion toward its su~p-
port ? Will they b~e contented with a rea-
fonable security, admitted in the form of
granting this s~upply, that it shall not be
augmented without their own consent ?
If ever any su~ch proposal had come from
America, I ar perfixaded it might have
s~erved as the fouzndation of fr-iendship,
and terminated in fame happy arrange-
ment. But if, by maintaining; their unioni
with us, they only mean to continue thle
the pradtice of calling upon our fleets and
armies to defend therm when attacked,
without contributing· any thing to support
thie power that p~roteats them, I do not
f~ee w'hat interest the slate has in this union·.
Nay, but they are wi~lling. to leave us' the
command of their trade. I confess I do

not

not fee thle wisdom of this policy on the
part of America, we are arrived at an age
of experience, in which all parties might
fee the expedience of exchanging reffric-
tions on trade for compensations in re-
venue. If the slate were dil'pofed to op-
prers, the might do To as effedtuallyy by
refiri~tions on trade, as by impositions of
taxes. And I believe, that if the Parlia-
mnent of Great Britain, in its disputes with
the Crown, had choien rather to leave the
trade of the people at its mercy, than to
grant its i-upplies, the Public would have
long since fuffered severely by the choice.

I am sorry that Dr. Price thould endea-

vour to flatter the Americanson a supposed
averflon of the people of Great Britain to
this war, or impute to this circumffance
the fuppoled flow progrel's made in re-
cruiting the army. The nursery of the
army in this country consists in the super-
numeraries of our manufadurers, and la-
bouring hands. Had the American lea-
ders,c by thutting their ports on our tra-
ders, diffreffed us as they proposed, re-
cruits for the army would have been but
too easily found , but as matters now

rcand,

[ 66 ]

stand, our armaments mufl: increase with
their ufulal pace. If, to avoid loading the
public, by means of new levies, with an
enormous half-pay l~ift at the end of the
war, it is to be opened with a supply
of foreign troops, I hope it wnill close
with~ them too; and th~at in whzatever
manner ~the: Exrf army that goes to. Amnerica

that is invaded, turn the s~uperiority of
numbers into disorder and weakness. The
Americans have not yet met the British
soldiers on the plain, and when they do,
their numbers, I imagine, will not avail
them much.

I have as highl a ifenfe of what men

ought, and will do, in defence of their
liberties, as any man: But I flatter my-
self, in the pres~ent cafe, that, unless the
Americans mistake independence and f~e-
paration of commonwealth for Liberty,
that they wvill not think themselves called
upon to try the force of this principle.

I thould willingly, with Dr. Price, in

the close of his pamphlet, or while he is
hastening to the conclusion (y), rejoice in
the profpeft of a power growing in Ame-
rica that thall aftoniih the world. If it
were not proposed to raise this power by
dirmembering the slate of Great Britain,
and by firipping her of a branch the has
nourithed with 10 much care, and which
by having partaken with her in every na-
tional advantage, is now in condition to
bear an equitable par-t in her burdens;

and which certainly, on every principle
of justice, human and divine, is not now
entitled to fay, we need you no lon-
g~er, and will take no farther part in
your affairs..

I confers that I think, when the cause

of our country is at flake, impartiality is
but a doubtful virtue. It may be noble
to with that our country thould do no
wrong, arid it may be lawful to flay her
hand when rashly lifted up against the
weak and the helpless; but when s~words
are drawn, to beat down that of a friend
while the enemy is striking, I am afraid,
is perfidy.

The Americans, it is true, are not

come here to invade us; but they with-
hold the rights of Great Britain, and
obhige us ·to invade them, which is a no
less juffifiab~le ground of hoff-ility. When
citizens of Great Britain anticipate with
J0y the independant or s~eparate greatners
of America, it is natural to fuppole, that
they thmnk the dismemberment of this
empire will bring us back only to what
we were about a century ago~; diminith
our luxury, give a check to many vices,

and by landing us down a few Rteps onl
the feale, on~ly renew our endpavours to

of a piece with thle biftory of mlankind;
nations in their progress, though weak
and inferior to their neighbours, s~purn
their con~dition, and continue to advance
from t~he bottom to the top of the fecale.
But nations that have been high can f~el-
dom bear a fall; they fink in the fecale
with a retrogade motion as rapid as they
advanced. Is ·Great Britain then t~o be
sacrificed. to America; the w~hole' to a
part, and a slate which hais~attained high
mealures of national felicity, for one that
is yet only in expe~tation, and which, by
attempting fa~ch extravagant plans of
Continental R~epublic, is probably laying
the feeds of anarchy, of civil wars, and at
last of a military gove~rnment, incomuch

withltanding the langu go. of indepen-
dence which he has taught the Ameri-
cans, is pleased to repeat with some ex-
prefi~ons o~f approbation, a motion for
peace, furggefied by a noble Lord, in
which the union, dependency, and par-
ticipation of Amierica. in the burdens of
the Empire are included as part of the
plan. The propos~al does honour to the
noble Lord; and if it had adtually come
from America, I thould have thought it
an equitable ground upon which to open
a council of deliberation with th~e most
friendly inteintions. I thould have prayed
that, while the deliberations were open,
parties would agree to a cessation of· arms,
and a filfpenflon of penal statutes. But I
fe~e not the use of fabricating plans of
which the first flep always is a conceiron
on the part of the slate, without any
overture of fulbmillion on the part of its
fubjeats. These fubjeas have treated
plans of the minority with the fame con-
tempt that they have treated aats of Par-
liament orr resolutions of the majority,
and feemn to ble determined to bring this
contest to an iifue more agreeable to the

enemies of Great Bri~tain than to its ci-
tizens and friends.

P. S. I know not how the tenets of

any party may be affe~ted by what I
write, but my paper is now in your
hands, if you plblifh it, lI hall be-
come the Author of a Pamphlet; and
in that cafe beg of you to remember,
that we Pamphlet-writers of every con-
dition mistake ourselves for ftatermen,
and so decide and advile without rese~rve.
But -that, not being singular, you will
treat me no worse than you have done
others of the f~ame description. Our es~-
teem with many is fallen ; but our confe-
quence with a warm-hearted and reason-
ing people, who like to be cons~ulted in
their own a~ffairs, merits the ·interpoition
of the belt informed and best intentioned
persons in the kingdom. My small pre-
.tediaons being only to a fbare of the last
gratification, I hope to meet with fomne
.indulgence on the firit. And am,
