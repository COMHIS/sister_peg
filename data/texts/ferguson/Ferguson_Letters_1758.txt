My Lord

I Understand Mr Home has been proposing Schemes for my Advantage in Scotland, & he has informed me of the manner in which your Lordship was pleased to receive them. I am very much affected with such proofs of your Lordships remembrance & Friendship, & whatever be the consequence can never forget the Respect & Gratitude which my treatment has at all times inspired me with. I have written to Mr Home on the Subject of his proposals, I am sorry the Affair is of a Nature to give trouble to my friends, & know he is Sanguine about every thing where friendship is concerned. You will be able to Judge how far Mr Abercrombie can be brought to reasonable terms, & I Shall have a particular Satisfaction in following any determination your Lordship is pleased to take the trouble of making for me.

I have not heard of Mr Kinloch since he went to Bath, he was then looking well, but his Spirits a little depressed with the apprehension of his remaining complaint. I have some thoughts of getting in to the Stage Coach & going down for some days to see how he does. I wish your Lordship Joy of the Victory on the Rhine but need not trouble you with the Accounts talked of here as you will be better informed.

I am With the most Sincere Respect 
& Affection 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
most faithful & 
most humble Servant

My Lord

Mr Kinloch I believe informed your Lordship, by the last post, of my intention to attend him on his journey Abroad, & I was extremely willing to be of any use to him; & went in to his proposal with little hesitation, till upon recollection I saw the difficulties which might attend by my being out of the Way at this time. He bore with the thoughts of allowing me to return when Necessary: but when I thought of the difficultys which might Attend my Return in time of War, & the inconveniency to him of being left in a Strange Countrey I determined it was better to lay aside thoughts of it Altogether.

I think Myself extremely Obliged to your Lordship for the trouble I understand you are pleased to take in what concerns me. Mr Home writes in very Sanguine terms on the prospect of Success in Making an Agreement with Mr Abercrombie: but his friendship as it may have led him to give your Lordship  trouble on my Account may likewise have made him think Other Circumstances equally easy. The Purchase is greatly beyond my Stock; but I am made to believe that the income of the place, with diligence in the Profession might enable me in a few years to clear the debt it woud bring upon me. And if it takes place I am determined to quiet my own Mind against any loss to my friends, by Ensurance. This affair however filled me with a good deal of Anxiety & made me a very improper Companion for Mr Kinloch; who I am affraid has taken my hesitations amiss. I took the Liberty to Recommend his continuing Mr Congalton; but he is not determined & Stays here a few days longer, he was told today that the Sailing of the Packet is interrupted by two French Cruizers which ply in the Passage, & that none will sail till a Man of War which is ordered Round comes to protect them. It made me uneasy that he imputed part of his delay to me: but many things have occurred to me that make it impracticable for me to go along with him as I at first intended. Among others I have been informed that the Gentleman in whose hands the greater part of my little Stock is lodged, has a prospect of Going to America. It is necessary for me to settle my affairs with him before he goes & to have my little funds in readyness if there is any prospect of making a Bargain with Mr Abercrombie. I am sorry to give your Lordship the trouble of so long a letter but it is owing to my Concern, for the Offence which Mr Kinloch seems to have taken, & to explain the Reasons of my not being able to accompany him as he wrote I intended.

Whatever be the Event of projects formed for me in Scotland I shall rest Satisfied in the Proofs I have received of your Lordships Goodness &

am with the greatest Respect 
My Lord 
your Lordships 
Most obliged & 
most humble Servant

Sir

I intended to have waited on you a few days ago when I was in Town; but I found the House of Commons was Sitting & had no hopes of finding you at Home. I have a Brother in Scotland who is very desirous of being in the Army, & I wanted to ask your opinion whether in the Present Situation of Affairs, there might be any hopes of Obtaining a Commission for him.

Lord Milton gave me reason to believe it woud not be difficult, last year when there was a report of some new Levies, & My Brother had settled his Affairs w't this View: but these new Levies never were made; and I know it is more difficult to Obtain commissions when Regiments are formed, & every Colonel ingaged to Provide for his own connections. My Brother has some Military merit, which you must have the Patience to hear. He had been settled at Bourdeaux with an Uncle in the time of the last War, & from a fondness for The Army left that Place to go to Flanders, without consulting with any of his Friends or letting them  know what became of him: The Consequence of that Step was his inlisting in General Brags Regiment. Lord George Sackville I believe at that time had the Command of that Regiment. He was wounded at the Battle of Fountenoy & taken Prisoner. I afterwards found him out by Accident & prevailed upon him to let me apply for his discharge. I make no doubt but in your own Department your hands are full of Solicitations & ingagements, & it may be out of your Way to apply to any body concerned in the Land Service, and this may be My Lord Butes case too, & I woud not make use of the access I have to any body to teize them improperly. I will be determined by your opinion & have great confidence that you will excuse this trouble

I am glad to hear that Mrs Murray is well recovered. I have begun to revise the Paper you saw, & I am changing it to a Dissertation on the Vicissitudes incident to Human Society, & propose when that is done to write two more on the History of Manners, & on the History of Literature & to satisfy myself with what may be done in a reasonable time without planing out works for a Lifetime.

I am Sr 
with the greatest Respect 
your most obliged & most humble Servant
