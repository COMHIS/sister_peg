My Lord

The Inclosed letters were sent to me that I might carry them to your Lordship: but being obliged to delay my setting out for some days it is proper that I forward them by the Post. Captain Fletcher was advised by Dr Pringle to go to the South of France for his health & The Duke of Bedfords going furnishing him with so good an opportunity of going without a Passport that he had no time to consult your Lordship upon it before he set out. He is still the youngest Captain in the Regiment & has only Lieutennants Pay there being a Captain from that Regiment allowed to retire upon his full pay. But this probably will not long be the Case as the Regiment is now before the Havanna. I will refer farther Particulars  and all Political news from this place till I have the pleasure of Seeing your Lordship.

Mr Oswald in a cover under which he sent me the Inclosed desires that I woud Join my Testimony to his Recommendation of Mr Drysdale. Which I do most willingly as Mr Drysdale has been my Intimate Friend for many years and I know him to be a very deserving Man who upon farther knowledge or tryal woud give your Lordship great Satisfaction.

I expect to be at Edinburgh in about a fortnight when I long to entertain you with what I have been able to understand of the temper of this place and am with the Most Sincere Respect and Affection your Lordships

Most Obliged &

My Dear Jack 

I received your Letter from Dover and forwarded the inclosed to Lord Milton who since I have been here has showed me a Letter of yours from Paris.

We are all very glad to find that your health is better and that you are so fortunate in the Duke of Bedfords attention and Civilities, Mr Forrester who is in this Country has written to second your former Recommendations. My Lord Approves of your following Doctor Pringles advice and thinks it very happy that you found so good an opportunity of going to France. He tells me that he will make up full Captains to pay to you from the date of your last Commission till you come to have it in the Regiment. The Regimentals of an English Officer are probably the finest Cloaths you need to wear even at Paris but in case the Stay you make there should be attended with a little extraordinary expence, he will make no difficulty of allowing you Fifty or Sixty pounds besides your ordinary Allowance for that purpose: but he thinks that you should not stay long there, that after two or three  weeks you shoud take your Leave of the Duke of Bedford in order to prosecute the Intention of your Journey.

I coud not tell who was Agent to your Regiment, but Mr Coutts I suppose will manage your Credite for you both with the Agent and in France. I beg you will write to let us know how you do.

Your Friends here were a little perplexed at first upon hearing you was going to France as they knew nothing of it from yourself at first, but I excused you on Account of the hurry & uncertainty you were in to the last moment. My Lord Milton was a little out of order the day I saw him which is the reason he desires me to inform you of the above particulars. This Country furnishes nothing new and I have got out of reach of London news. Your friends are all well. Your Horses leg continued a little sore and I was afraid to Trust him in so long a Journey. I left him with Home and took a Horse of Clerks which he had.

I am Dear Jack your most affect.

My Lord

I have often Encouraged my acquaintances here with hopes that the Friends of the English Militia woud support our Motions in Parliament, and was perhaps in danger of encroaching a little on the Art of Political Lying if I had not been sure of your Lordship to save me from that Reproach. If your Old Ennemys are still in Array against us there is no help for it. I joined in the Clamour of which I sent your Lordship some Specimens & did all I coud to encrease it, nor with any very Sanguine expectations of Success but with a Conviction that at all Events this one of the best objects which we can have in View. Even the English Militia may for ought I know fall into dissuse after a Peace; but I apprehend it has already given a twist to our manners, & may like the infusion of so much new blood bestow at least a temporary Vigour & serve to  prolong the Life of the State. The next best thing to the procuring of Actual Political Establishments for this purpose is turning the Attentions & desires of men to such Establishments & to make them think & disspute about them. There has been Nothing worthy of Notice published since the last Paper I sent your Lordship. But a Numerous meeting of Country Gentlemen has been held to think of the Proper methods of applying to Parliament for a Militia & that care is now devolved on about twenty of the Number under the Name of a Comittee who meet frequently & with other things have sent Circular letters to all the Counteys & Burghs of Scotland to recommend this Subject as a proper one on which to instruct their Representatives.

They write Likewise to some of The Members of Parliament at London who were most Active in supporting the former motion. We already see Some cause to rejoice in the Zeal which is discovered by Numbers here, we shall see more if Politicians Elsewhere from Affection Candour  Remissness or Stupidity in which last they are not perhaps always wanting shoud suffer our Motion to be made & our Law to pass. We shall at least by returning frequently put them to their Shifts for Evasions & this too in my Philosophy is doing a good thing. So that you see I am not hard to please on the Article of Success. I woud willingly hope however that we may prevail some time or Other. Mr Hume instead of being Averse to Turbulent Conversation has made himself Member of a Society who call themselves the Poaker Club in Alusion to the use of that Instrument when fires like ours need to be Stirred. But I write with so much pleasure that I forget the time it would take to read my letter. If there was any thing either to amuse or interest from this Country I woud lose no opportunity of expressing the Respect & Esteem with which I have the Honour to be My Lord

My Lord

I have made up a Packet of newspapers for your Lordship. It contains some Specimen of the Controversy which Subsists here about the Militia. Our Cold reasonings deserve very little notice at London, but there are some strokes of a different stile in some of these Papers, & I cannot resist indulging my own Partiality to the Subject. I believe your Lordship has been told of an object which I have a view to here in the way of Preferment. I mentioned it lately to Coll' Clerk & must refer to him for Particulars. It is the place of Principal in Our College, The person who holds it now is very old & I am just now informed that he is taken Ill & considered as Dying. How far your Lordship can or ought in Propriety to interfere in it a question which I avoid thinking of. It is a very great Pleasure to me to think that I coud have recourse  to your Lordships Protection & favour upon a proper occasion, without expecting any Attention to my request where it is improper. This place however stands in my way & is the only one which from my Situation I coud expect to Reach, Which is all the Apology I can make for this Trouble And am with the greatest Respect

My Lord
