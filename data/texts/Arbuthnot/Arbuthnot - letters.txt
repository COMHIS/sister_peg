Dear Friend
I'm most heartily greivd for the loss of your excellent & worthy freind, & more for the affliction of another. I dont love to irritate a fresh wound else, I would have taken the freedom to have wrote to My Lord. I pity his case with all my heart, for what ever other affliction he has been usd to he is much a stranger to domestick calamitys I have a true sense of his present condition for which I know philosophy & religion are both too weak, & I beleive it is the will of god that it should be so. I have lost six children. If I am not deceivd I beleive I could have been content to have ransomd the lives of every one of them, ev'n at the hard terms of begging their bread. I know My lord has the sentiment of humanity & paternall affection very strong, & I should not love him so well if he had not; therfor my Dear Friend I question not but that yow will upon this occasion do those offices of humanity that are incumbent upon yow upon many accounts, which yow will find will succeed better by turning his thoughts to other objects than by the most rational reflections, upon the present affliction, every body here shares in his greif from her Majesty down to the meanest of his humble servants. My Lady Masham was so much surprisd & greived that we were affraid it would hurt her in her present condition. I am glad I did not know My lady Carmarthen so well as yow, but I know enough to beleive her a most valuable person, I have nothing left to wish for My Lord as a saving in this case but that god would preserve the life of the poor child to be some comfort to him. I beleive it will not be a good way for My Lord to keep up, but to appear as soon as possible again in his business; for I know by Experience, that the best cure is by diverting the thoughts. I hope we may see yow here next Saturday. your friends remember yow kindly.
I am 
Dear sir 
Your affectionat Brother

Take your opportunity to make my compliments to My Lord. I am truly sorry for him, & I have the Vanity to think he would be so for me upon such an occasion.

Dear Brother
I am glad your proud Stomach is come down, & that you submitt to write to your freinds, I was of opinion that if they managd yow right they might bring yow to be fond even of an article of the post boy or flying post. As for the present state of our Court affairs, I thank God I am allmost as ignorant as yow are to my great ease, & comfort, I have never enquird about any thing, since MLM told the Dragon, that she would carry no more Messages nor medle nor make, &c. I don't know whether things were quite so bad when yow went. The D—n manages this Bill, pretty well, for yow know that is his forte, & I beleive at the Rate they go on, they will do Mischief to themselves & good to no body else. Yow know that Gay gos to Hanover, and My Lord Treasurer has promis'd to equipp him. Munday is the day of departure, & he is now dancing attendance, for money to buy him shoes stockings & linen. The Duchess has turnd him off which I am affraid will make the poor Man's Condition worse instead of better. The Dragon was with us on Saturday night last after having sent us really a most excellent copy of verses, I really beleive when he lays down he will prove a very good poet. I remember the first part of his verses was complaining of ill usage & at last he concludes
he that cares not to rule, will be sure to obey, 
when summon'd by Arbuthnot, pope parnell & Gay.
Parnell has been thinking of going chaplain to My lord Clarendon, but they will not say whether he should or not. I am to meett our Club at the pall mall coffee house about one to day, wher we can not fail to remember yow The Q—n is in good health much in the same circumstances wt the Gentleman I mention'd, in attendance upon her Ministers for some thing she can not obtain. My Lord & My Lad[y] Masham & Lady Fair remember you kindly, & none with more sincere respect than
Your affectionat Brother & 
humble servant

I had allmost resolvd not to write to yow, for fear of disturbing so happy a state as you descrybe; on the other hand, a little of the divill, that cannot endure any body should enjoy a paradise, almost provok'd me to give you a long, & melancholy state of our affairs for yow must know, [that] is just my own case, I have with great industry endeavourd to live in ignorance, but at the same time would enjoy Kensinton Garden, & then some busy discontented body or another comes just cross me: & beginns a dismall story, & befor I go to supper, I am as full of greivances as the most knowing of them: I will plague you a little by telling you that the Dragon dy's hard He is now kicking & cuffing about him like the divill. & you know parliamentary manaagement is the forte but no hopes of any settlement between the two champions. The Dragon said last night to My L M—m, & me that it is with great industry he keeps his friends, who are very numirous from pulling all to pieces, Gay had a hundred pound in due time, [and] went away a happy man. I have sollicited both Ld Tr & Ld Bolingbroke strongly for the parnelian, & gave them a memorial t'other day. Ld Trs speaks mighty affectionatly of him, which yow know is an ill sign in Ecclesiastical preferments. witness some, that yow know, & I know, wher the contrary was the best sign in the world.
Pray Remember Martin, who is an innocent fellow, & will not disturb your solitude. The ridicule of Medicin is so copious a subject that I must only here & ther touch it. I have made him study physick from the Apothecarys bills, wher ther is a good plentifull field for a satyr upon the present practice; one of his projects was by a stamp upon blistering plaisters & melilot by the yard, to raise money for the Govert & to give it to R—ff & others to farm, But ther was like to be a petition from the inhabitants of London & Westminster who had no mind to be flead. There was a probleme about the doses of purging Medecins published four years ago showing that they ought [to] be in proportion to the bulk of the patient. from thence, Martin endeavours to determin the question about the Weight of the Ancient men, by the doses of physick that were givn them. one of his best inventions was a map of diseases for the three cavitys & one for the external parts, just like the four quarters of the world. Then the Great diseases are like capital Citys with their symptoms all like streets & suburbs, with the Roads that lead to other diseases it is thicker sett with Towns than any flanders Map yow ever saw. R—ff is painted at the corner of the Map, contending for the universal empire of the world, & the rest of the physicians opposing his ambitious designs with a project of a Treaty of partition to settle peace. Ther is an excellent subject of ridicule from some of the German physicians, who sett up a sensitive soul as a sort of a first Minister to the rational. Helmont calls him Archaeus, Dolaeus calls him Microcosmetor. he has under him severall other Genii that reside in the particular parts of the body, particularly Prince Cardimelech in the heart. Gasteronax in the stomach, & the plastick prince in the organs of Generation. I believe I could make yow laugh at the explication of distempers from the wars & Allyances of those princes & how the first Minister getts the better of his Mistress anima rationalis The best is that it is making a reprisal upon the politicians, who are sure to Allegorize all the animal oeconomy into state affairs. Pope has been collecting high flights of poetry, which are very good, they are to be solemn nonsense. I thought upon the following t'other day as I was going into my Coach, the dust being troublesome:
The dust in smaller particles arose 
than those which fluid bodyes do compose. 
Contrarys in extremes do often meett. 
'twas now so drye, that you might call it wett
I dont give yow these hints to divert yow but that yow may have your thoughts & work upon them. I know yow love me heartily & yet I will not own that yow love me better than I love yow. My ld & lady Masham love yow too & read your letter to me with pleasure. My lady says she will write to yow, whether yow write to her or not.

Dear Brother
I have talk'd of your affair to no body but My Lady M-m, she tells me that she has it very much at heart, & would gladly do it for her own sake & that of her freinds but thinks it not a fitt season to speak about it. We are indeed in such a strange Condition as to politicks that no body can tell now who is for who. it were worth the while to be here four & twenty hours, only to consider the oddness of the scene. I am sure it would make yow relish your country life better. The Dragon holds fast with a dead grype the little Machine if he would have taken but half so much pains to have done other things, as he has of late to Exert him self against the Esquire, he might have been a dragon, instead of a dagon. I would no more have suffered & done what he has, than I would have sold my self to the Gallys. haec inter nos. however they have gott now rid of the parlimt & may have time to think of a scheme, perhaps they may have one allready. I know nothing but 'tis fitt to rally the broken forces under some head or another They really did very well the last day but one in the house of Lords. but yesterday, they were in a flame about the Queens answer, till the Queen came in & putt an end to it. The Dragon showd me your letter & seemd mightily pleasd with it. he has pay'd ten pounds for a manuscript of which I beleive ther are severalls in town, it is a history of the last invasion of Scotland. wrote just as plain, tho not so well as another History which yow & I know, with characters of all the men now living, The very names & invitation that was sent to the pretender, This by a flaming Jacobite that wonders that all the world are not so. perhaps it may be a Whig that personates a Jacobite. I saw two sheets of the beginning which was treason every line. if it go's on at the same rate of plain dealing, it is a very extraordinary piece, & worth your while to come up to see it only. Mr Lockhart they say ownes it it is no more his than it is mine. dont be so dogged, but after the first Shower, come up to town for a week or so. it is worth your while.
your friends will be glad to see yow, & none more than my self adieu.

I thought it necessary to speak to L M—m about that affair, because I believe it will be necessary to give her Majesty the same notion of it which the memoriall dos, & not that yow are asking a little scandalous sallary for a sinecure. Lewis despairs of it & thinks it quite over since a certain affair. I will not think so. I gave your letter with the enclosed Memorial Cavalierement to L B—ke he read it, & seemd concernd at some part of it expressing himself thus, that it would be amongst the eternal scandals of the govert to suffer a man of your character, that had so well deservd of them to have the least uneasy thought, about these matters. as to the 50ll he was ready to pay it; & if he had had it about him would have givn it me: The Dragon all the while was walking with the Duke of Sh — berry, so my L B—ke told me, I would immediatly stirr in this matter, but I know not how I stand with some folks (for the D S—rry is taken him self to the Dragon, in appearance) I know how I stand wt that man, (pointing to the Dragon) but as to the other I cant tell. however, I will claim his promise. & so he took the Memorial. Dont think I make yow a bare compliment in what I am going to say for I can assure you I am in earnest I am in hopes to have two hundred pounds before I go out of town, & yow may command all or any part of it yow please as long as you have occasion for it I know what yow will say, to see a scoundrell pretend to offer to lend me money. our scituation at present is in short thus they have rompu en visiere with the Dragon, & yet dont know how to do wtout him M L M—m has in a Manner bid him defyance without any scheme, or Likeness of it in any form or shape as far as I can see. notwtstanding he visits cringes flatters &c. which is beyond my comprehension. I have a very comical accompt of Letcomb, & the D of St patricks from pope, with an Episode of the Burning glass. I was going to make an Epi Gramm upon the imagination of your Burning your own History wt a Burning glass. I wish pope or parnell would putt it into Rhyme. the thought is this, Apollo speaks that since he had inspired yow to reveal those things which were hid ev'n from his own light such as the feeble springs of some Great events, & perceaving that a faction who could not bear their deeds to be brought to light had condemnd it to an ignominious flame, that it might not perish so, he was resolv'd to consume it wt his own a celestial one & then yow must conclude with some simile Thus &c. Ther are two or three that will fitt it. Whetstone has at, last publish'd his project of the longitude; the most ridiculous thing that ever was thought on, but a pox on him he has spoild one of my papers of Scriblerus', which was a proposal for the longitude not very unlike his to this purpose, that since ther was no pole for East & west that all the princes of Europe should joyn & build two prodigious poles upon high mountains with a vast Light house to serve for a pole Star. I was thinking of a calculation of the time charges & dimensions. Now you must understand his project is by light houses & explosion of bombs, at a certain hour. Lewis invited me to dinner to day, & has disappointed me. I thought to have said some thing more about yow.
I have nothing more to add but my Dear friend a Dieu.

I suppose yow have reced the Account of St Kilda. Ther is an officer ther who is a sort of a tribunus plebis, whose office it is to represent the Greivances of the people to the laird of Mcleod who is suppos'd to be their oppressor, he is bound to contradict the laird till he gives him three Strokes wt a cane over the head, & then he is at liberty to submitt. This I have done & so has your friend L—s it has been said that we & the Dean were the Authors of all that has since happend by keeping the Dragon in when there was an offer to lay down, I was told to my face that what I said in this case went for nothing, that I did not care if the great persons affair's went to entire ruin so that I could support the interests of the Dragon. that I did not know the half of his proceedings, particularly it was said tho I am confident it was a mistake that he had attempted the removing her from the favour of a Great person. in short the fall of the Dragon dos not proceed alltogether from his old friend but from the Great person, whom I perceave to be highly offended by little hints that I have receav'd. In short The Dragon has been so ill us'd, & must serve upon such terms for the future if he should, that I swear I would not advyse Turk jew nor infidel to be in that state. come up to town & I can tell you more. I have been but indifferently treated my self by some body at Court in small concerns, I can't tell who it is! but mum for that.

My Dear Friend
I thank yow for your kind Letter, which is very comfortable upon such a melancholy occasion My Dear Mistress's days were numbred even in My imagination & could not exceed such certain Limits but of that small number a great deal was cutt off by the last troublesome scene of the contention amongst her Servants. I beleive sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her, only it surprised her too suddainly before she had sign'd her will, which no doubt her being involvd in so much business hindr'd her from finishing. it was unfortunate that she had been persuaded as is supposd by Lowndes that it was necessary to have it under the great Seal. I have figurd to myself all this Melancholy Scene & even if it be possible worse than it has happened twenty times, so that I was prepard for it. My Case is not half so deplorable as that of poor Lady Mashams & severalls of the Queen's servants, some of whom have no chance for their bread but the generosity of his present Majesty which severall people that know him very much commend. so far is plain from what has happen'd in publick affairs that what one party affirm'd of the settlement has prov'd true, & that it was firm, that it was in some measure an advantage to the successor not to have been here & so obligd to declare him self in severall things in which he is now at liberty. & indeed never any prince in this respect came to the Crown with greater advantages. I can assure you the peacable scene that now appears is a disappointment to more than one sett of people. I have an opportunity calmly & philosophically to consider that treasure of vileness & baseness that I allways beleived to be in the heart of man, & to behold them exert their insolence & baseness, every new instance instead of surprising & greiving me really diverts me & in a manner improves my Theory. Tho I think I have not mett with it in my own case except from one man & he was very far mistaken for to him I would not abate one grain of my proud Spirit. Dear Freind the last sentence of your letter quite kills me: never repeat that melancholy tender word that you will endeavour to forgett me. I am sure I never can forgett yow, till I meett with, (what is impossible) another whose conversation I can so much delight in as Dr Swifts & yet that is the smallest thing I ought to value you for. That hearty sincere freindship That plain & open ingenuity in all your commerce, is what I am sure I never can find in another alas. I shall want often, a faithfull monitor one that would vindicate me behind my back & tell me my faults to my face. god knows I write this with tears in my eyes. yet do not be obstinate, but come up for a little time to London, & if you must needs go, we may concert a manner of Correspondence wherever we are. I have a letter from Gay just before The Queen's death, is he not a true poet who had not one of his own books to give to the princess that askd for one.

London, Sept. 7, 1714.
I am extreamly oblig'd to you for taking notice of a poor old distressed courtier, commonly the most despiseable thing in the world. This blow has so rous'd Scriblerus that he has recover'd his senses, and thinks and talks like other men. From being frolicksome and gay he is turn'd grave and morose. His lucubrations lye neglected amongst old newspapers, cases, petitions, and abundance of unanswerable letters. I wish to God they had been amongst the papers of a noble Lord sealed up. Then might Scriblerus have pass'd for the Pretender, and it would have been a most excellent and laborious work for the Flying Post or some such author, to have allegoriz'd all his adventures into a plot, and found out mysteries somewhat like the Key to the Lock. Martin's office is now the second door on the left hand in Dover-street, where he will be glad to see Dr. Parnell, Mr. Pope, and his old friends, to whom he can still afford a half pint of claret. It is with some pleasure that he contemplates the world still busy, and all mankind at work for him. I have seen a letter from Dean Swift; he keeps up his noble spirit, and tho' like a man knock'd down, you may behold him still with a stern countenance, and aiming a blow at his adversaries. I will add no more, being in hast, only that I will never forgive you if you don't use my foresaid house in Dover street with the same freedom as you did that in St. James's; for as our friendship was not begun upon the relation of a courtier, so I hope it will not end with it. I will always be proud to be reckon'd amongst the number of your friends and humble servants.

Ev'n in affliction your letter made me melancholy, & communicated some of the spleen which yow had when yow wrote it, and made me forfeilt some of my reputation of cheerfullness & temper under afflictions. however I have so many subjects among my friends & fellow servants to be greivd for, that I can easily turn it off my self with credit. The Queens poor servants are like so many poor Orphans, exposed in the very streets, & those whose past obligations of gratitude & honour ought to have engagd them to have represented their case pass by them like so many abandon'd creatures, without the possibility of ever being able to make the least return for a favour, which has added to my Theory of human Virtue. I wish I did not only haunt yow in the obliging & affectionat sense yow are pleasd to express it but were personally present with you, & I think it were hardly in the power of fortune not to make some minutes pleasant. I dine with My lord and lady Masham to-day, where we will, as usually, remember yow. Yow have read ere this time the History of the white Staff, which is either contriv'd by an enimy or by himself, to bring down vengeance, & I have told some of his nearest friends so. all the Dragon can say will not give him one single freind amongst the whole party, & therefore I even wonder at him, which yow will say is a strange thing. The very great person of all can hardly speak of him with patience. the Condé acts like a Man of spirit, Makes up to the K & talks to him & would have acted with more sense than any of them could he have had any body to have acted along with him nos numerus sumus &c The Man yow speak off is just as you describe so I beg pardon Shadwell says he will have my place of Chelsea. G—th told me his meritt was, giving intelligence about his Mistris health. I desired he would do me the favour to say that I valud my self upon quite the cotrary & I hopd to live to see the day when his Majesty would value me the more for it too. I have not seen any thing as yet to make me recant a certain inconvenient opinion I have, that one cannot pay too dear for peace of mind. Poor philosopher Berkley; has now the idea of health, which was very hard to produce in him, for he had an idea of a strange feaver upon him so strong that it was very hard to destroy it by introducing a contrary one. poor Gay is much were he was only out of the Duchesses family & service he has some confidence in the Princess and Countess of Picbourg. I wish it may be significant to him. I advycd him to make a poem upon the princess before she came over descrybing her to the English ladys, for it seems the princess does not dislike that; (she is really a person that I beleive will give great content to every body) but Gay was in such a groveling condition, as to the affairs of the world, that his muse would not stoop to visit him. I can say no more of newes than that you will find the proceedings hitherto have been comparatively gentle. adieu.

Dear Brother
I send yow the scrape of a letter begun to yow by the whole Society because I suppose yow ev'n value the fragments of your friends. The Honest Gentleman at whose lodgings we wrote is gone for ffrance, I really value your judgement extreamly in chusing your friends I think worthy Mr Foord is an instance of it being an honest sensible firm friendly man, & qaulis ab incaptu processerat &c, tho by the way praising your judgement is a little compliment to myself, which I am apt to fall into of late, no body now being at the trouble of doing it for me. The parnelian, who was to have carried this letter seems to have changd his mind, by some sudden turn in his affairs but I wish his hopes may not be the effect of some accidental thing working upon his spirits, rather than any well grounded project. If it be any pleasure to you I can assure you that you are remember'd kindly by your friends & I believe not altogether forgott by your Enimys. I think both is for your reputation. I am told that I am to lose my little preferment however I hope to keep a little habitation warm in town. I cannot but say, I think ther is one thing in your Circumstance that might make any man happy which is a liberty to preach; such a prodigious priviledge, that if it did not border on Simony I could really purchase it for a summ of money, for my part I can never imagine any man can be uneasy that has the opportunity of venting himself to a whole congregation once a week, & yow may pretend what yow will I am sure yow think so to, or yow don't judge right as for newes I never enquire about any fuimus troes &c sed nunc ferox Jupiter transtulit omnia ad Argos. My present politick is to give no disturbance to the present folks in the due exercise of their power for fear of forcing them to do very strange things rather than part with what they love so well. untoward reports in the country will make elections dearer, which I am sorry for The Dragon I am affraid will be struck at. adieu in Hast. I must not forgett to tell you a passage of the pretenders declaration to this purpose, that he had no reason to doubt of his Sisters good intention towards him, which made him sitt quiet in her time, but was now dissapointed by the deplorable accident of her sudden death.

— I congratulate you upon Mr. Tickel's first Book. It does not indeed want its merit; but I was strangely disappointed in my expectation of a Translation nicely true to the original; whereas in those parts where the greatest exactness seems to be demanded, he has been the least careful, I mean the History of ancient Ceremonies and Rites, &c. in which you have with great judgment been exact.

I receaved your very Heraclitian letter; I am kinder than yow I desire to hear your complaints, and will allways share them, when I cannot remove them. I should have the same concern for things as yow, were I not convinc'd that a comet will make much more strange revolutions upon the face of our Globe, than all the petty changes that can be occasioned by Goverts & Ministrys and yow will allow it to be a matter of importance to think of methods to save ones self & family in such a terrible shock when this whole earth will turn upon new poles & revolve in a new orbite. I consider my self as a poor passenger, & that the earth is not to be forsaken nor the rocks remov'd for me. but yow are certainly some first minister of a great Monarch, who for some Misbehaviour are condemnd in this revolution of things to govern a chapter & a quire of singing men. I am sure I should think my self happy if I had only such a province as the latter. Certainly your chapter is too peacable, and not like other chapters else they would give yow more occupation. yow see I begin with philosophy as to business, I this moment sawe the Dragon. he had your letters & shewed them to me some time ago, and seems to be mighty fond of the project, only he is to be at Wimple & not in Herefordshire & it is but a step further. & he is to write this night if yow beleive him to that very purpose, nay I am to have the letter to enclose & I intend to keep mine open till eleven. It is strange that yow should imagine the Dragon had cast his exuviae in his Den, or that Confinement is a Cure for inactivity so far from it. all these habits are ten times stronger upon him than ever. [Lewis] will furnish yow with a collection of new storys that are as far beyond the old ones as yow can imagine. therefor I say again come & yow will be far from finding such dismall scenes as yow describe. your own letter will furnish yow with topicks to conquer your Melancholy for in such mutability, what is it that must not in time cast up even the return of that Brother you mention and as philosophical as I am I should be very sad if I did not think that very probable & feasible. As to your friends, though the world is changed to them, they are not changd to yow and yow will be Caressed as much as ever and by some that bore yow no good will formerly. do yow think there is no pleasure in hearing the H—r club declaim upon the clemency & gentleness of the Late Reign, and a thousand stranger things as for the Constitution it is in no more danger than a strong man that has gott a little surfeit by Drunkenness. all will be well & people recover their sober senses every day. severall of your friends dine with me to day L Ma — , Jo. Drummond The Judge &c when yow will be remembered. I wish I could return your compliments as to my wife and Bairns. Sure you are a very ill Husband for you had the compleat Thousand when you was in England & six pence of another thousand given by the Dragon, I remember that full well. L is gone his progress I shall be at Bath in a fortnight come that way. adieu. I really think the person I recommended will do well, he will be quite another thing befor Michaelmas, with Roseingraves teaching. & he has a good voice.

Dear Sir
This serves for an envelope for the enclosed, for I cannot tell whither yow care to hear from any of your freinds on this side. In your last I think yow desird me to lett yow alone to enjoy your own Spleen. can yow purchase your fifty pound a year in Wales, as yet. I can tell yow befor hand Lewis scorns to live with yow ther. he keeps company with the greatest, and is princ-Governour in many familys. I have been in France six weeks at Paris and as much at Rowen where I can assure yow I hardly heard a word of newes or politicks except a little clutter about sending some impertinent presidents du parlement to prison that had the impudence to talk for the lawes and Libertys of their Country. I was askd for Monsr Swift by many people I can assure yow, and particularly by the Duke D'aumont. I was respectfully & kindly treated by many folks & ev'n by the great Mr Lawes: amongst other things I had the Honour to carry an Irish Lady to Court that was admired beyond all the Lady's in France for her Beauty. She had great Honours done her The Hussar himself was orderd to bring her the King's Catt to Kiss, her name is Bennet. amongst other folks I saw your old freind Ld Bolingbroke, who asked for yow he looks just as he did, your freinds here are in good health, not changd in their sentiments towards yow. I left my two Girls in France with their uncle which was my chief business. I don't know that I have any freinds on your side besides Mr Foord to whom give my service & to Dr Parnell [and] Mr Jervas. If it be possible for you obey the contents of the enclosd which I suppose is a kind invitation The Dragon is just as he was, only all his old habits ten times stronger upon him than ever. let me beg of yow not to forgett me, for I can never cease to love & esteem you. being ever

Dear Brother,
for so I had call'd yow before were it not for a certain Reverence I pay to Deans, I find yow wish both me & your self to be old & rich. The second gos in course along with the first; but yow cannot give 7 (that is the tith of 70) good reasons for either glad at my heart should I be if Dr Helsham or I could do yow any good. My service to Dr Helsham, he dos not want my advice in the Case. I have done good lately to a patient & a freind in that Complaint of a Vertigo by Cinnabar of Antimony & Castor, made up into Boluss with Confect of Alkermes. I had no great opinion of the Cinnabar, but trying it amongst other things, my freind found good of this prescription; I had tryd the Castor alone before; not with so much success. Small quantitys of Tinctur Sacr: now & then will do yow good. Ther is 20 Lords I believe, would send yow horses, if they knew how. one or two have offerd to me, who, I beleive, would be as good as their word. Mr Rowe the Poet Laureat is dead and has left a Damn'd jade of a pegasus. Ile answer for it he wont do as your Mare did having more need of Lucan's present than Sir Richard Blackmore. I would fain have Pope gett a patent for life for the place with a power of putting in Durfy his deputy. I sent for the two Roseingraves & examin'd the matter of fact. The younger had no Concern in this note of 20ll. The Elder sayes that he thought the 20ll due to him for the pains & some expenses he had been at about the young fellow & his Master Bethel who had given Mr Roseingrave the Elder 10 guineas befor thought the same reasonable. he sayes he did not take it by way of a Bribe but as his due & did never intend to make use of it but when the young fellow was in circumstances to pay him. the yo[unge]r Roseingrave was begg'd & entreated both by Bethel & the young fellow (who would not go without him) to accompany him to Ireland & did believe that Bearing his expenses, which was done by Bethel was the least he could take. Ther is one thing in the fellows paper that I know to be a lye his being used by Roseingrave at Ld Carnavons he sung there I believe once or twice for his own instruction or tryal & Lord Carnavon gave him a guinea: he went sometimes to hear the musick for his improvement. This is what they told me, however I have Reprimanded The Elder Roseingrave for taking the note. when this fellow came first to town I thought his Voice might do but found it did not improve.
It is mighty hard to gett such a sort of Voice. Ther is an excellent one in the Kings chappell but he will not go. The top one of the world is in Bristol Quire & I beleive might be manag'd tho your Roseingrave is really much improvd so do not totally exclude the young fellow till yow have more Maturely consider'd this matter. The Dragon is come to town, & was entering upon the detail of the Reasons of State that kept him from appearing at the beginning, &c. when I did beleive at the same time, it was only a Law of Nature to which the Dragon is most subject Remanere in statu in quo est nisi deturbetur ab extrinseco. Ld Harley & Lady Harley give yow their service. Lewis is in the country with Lord Bathurst & has wrote me a most dreadfull story of a Mad Dog that bit their Huntsmen since which accident I am told he has shortened his stirrups three Bores, they were not long befor. Ld Oxford presented him with two Horses he has sold one & sent the other to Grass avec Beaucoup de sagesse. I don't beleive the story of Ld Bolingbrokes Marriage; for I have been consulted about the lady, & by some defects in her constitution, I should not think her appetite lay much toward Matrimony. There is some talk about reversing his attainder, but I wish he may not be disappointed. I am all for presidents of that kind. They say the pretender is like to have his chief minister impeached too. he has his wife prisoner. The footmen of the House of Commons choose their Speaker and impeach &c. I think it were proper that all monarchs should serve their apprenticeships as pretenders, that we might discover their defects. Did yow ever expect to see the Duke of Ormond fighting against the protestant succession & the Duke of Berwick fighting for it; [and] France in confederacy with England, to reduce the exorbitant power of Spain. I really think there is no such good reason for living till 70 as curiosity. Yow say yow are ready to Resent it as an affront if I thought a Beautiful Lady a curiosity in Ireland, but pray is it an affront to say that a Lady hardly known or observed for her beauty in Ireland, is a curiosity in France. all Deans naturally fall into paralogysms. my wife gives yow her kind love & service, & which is the first thing to occur to all wives wishes yow well married.I have not clean paper more than to bid you adieu.

I was out of town when your letter came but I am glad the contents were obeyd, by my Maids opening of it. I am as glad you are turnd such a Bon Vivant. but you have so good a ham over against you, I wonder you want any other. This is in the manner of your Conversation with Lady Mary for which you are so often reprimanded, & never reformd; may I take the freedom to give her ladyship my most humble respects. Ile tell you freely when I go to Twitenham it is to pay my respects to her ladyship, & not to see you. for you never stay a moment with me. I was busy all last week & shall be this too. but next I hope to have the vision, tho I will not putt a profane Epithet to it.

The Handsome thing would have been, to have taken away my picture & sent me her own; now to return the compliment I must pay for hers. I hope she is well, & if I can make her so, It will be a sensible pleasure to me. I know no body has a better Right to a Ladys good looks in a picture than her physician if he can procure them.
I was with My Lord Peterborow when I receaved yours. he was spick & span new just come ffrom ffrance you was the first man he askd for. I din'd with him & the Mrs Robinsons on Tuesday & suppd with him last night with the same company: he had been employd all that day in Running the Robinsons’ [Goods] for them which he executed with great Conduct. I cannot tell how much I am obligd to him he deliverd a Memorial from me to the Regent with his own hand he is mightily enamourd of my Brother Robert he is indeed a Knight errant like him Self.

Dear Sir
I have as good a Right to invade your solitude as L B Gay or Pope and yow see I make use of it I know yow wish us all at the Devil for Robbing a moment from your Vapors & Vertigo its no Matter for that yow shall have a Sheet of paper every post, till yow come to yourself; by a paragraph in yours to Mr pope I find yow are in the case of the Man, who held a whole night By a Broom Bush, & found when day Light came he was within two inches of the ground. yow don't seem to know how well yow stand with our great Folks. I my self have been at a great mans table & have heard out of the mouths of violent Irish whigs, the whole table talk; turn upon your commendation; if it had not been upon the Generall topicks of your good qualitys & the good yowdid I should have grown jealous of yow. my intention in this, is not to expostulate but to do yow good. I know how unhappy a vertigo makes anybody that has the misfortune to be troubled with it; (I might have been deep in it myself if Ide had a mind.) & I will propose a cure for yours that Ile pawn my reputation upon. I have of late sent severall patients in that case to the Spaa to drink there of the Geronster water which will not carry from the spott. it has succeeded Marvelously with them all. there was indeed one who relaps'd a little this last summer because he would not take my advice & return to his course that had been too short the year before. but because the instances of eminent Men are most conspicuous Lord whitworth our plenipotentiary had this disease (which by the way is a little disqualifying for that employment) he was so bad, that he was often forc'd to catch hold of any thing to keep him from falling. I know he was recoverd by the use of that water to so great a degree that he can Ride walk or do anything as formerly. I leave this to your consideration. your friends here wish to see you & none more than myself, but I really dont advise you to such a jurney to gratify them or myself, but I am allmost confident it would do yow a great dale of good. The Dragon is just the old man when he is Rous'd. he is a little deaf but has all his other good & bad qualitys just as of old. LB is much improvd in knowledge manner & every thing else. the shaver is an honest friendly man as befor. he has a good dale a do to smother his welsh fire which yow know he has in a greater degree than some would imagine. he posts him self a good part of the year in some warm house wins the Ladys’ money at ombre, & convinces them that they are highly oblig'd to him L & Ly M Mr Hill & Mrs Hill often remember yow with affection.
as for your humble servt, with a great Stone in his Right kidney & a family of Men & women to provide for, he is as Chearfull as ever in publick affairs he has kept as Tacitus sayes Medium iter inter vile servitium & abruptam Contumaciam he never rails at a great man, but to his face, which I can assure yow he has had both the opportunity & licence to do. he has some few weak friends & fewer enimys if any he is low enough to be rather despis'd than pusht at by themI am ffaithfully

Dear Sir
I have the vanity to think, that a few freinds have a reall Concern for me & are uneasy, when I am in distress, in Consequence of which I ought to communicate with them the joy of my recovery. I did not want a most kind paragraph in your letter to Mr Pope to convince me that yow are of the number, & I know that I give you a sensible pleasure in telling yow that I think my self at this time allmost perfectly recover'd of a most unusual & dangerous distemper, an imposthume in the Bowels, such a one, that had it been in the hands of a chirurgeon, in an outward & fleshy part, I should not have been well these three months. Duke Desny our old Friend is in a fair way to recover of such another; ther have been severall of them occasiond as I reckon by the cold & wett season. people have told me of new impostures (as they call'd them) every day. poor Sir William Wyndham is an imposture. I hope the Bath, wher he is going will do him good. The hopes of seeing once more the Dean of St patricks revives my spirits, I can not help imagining some of our old club mett together like Mariners after a Storm. for gods sake don't tantalize your freinds, any more. I can prove by twenty unanswerable arguments that it is absolutely necessary, that yow should come over to England, that it would be committing the greatest absurdity that ever was not to do it the next approaching Winter. I believe indeed it is just possible to save your soul wtout it & thats all. As for your Book, (of which I have framd to my self, such an idea, that I am persuaded ther is no doing any good upon mankind without it) I will sett the letters my self rather than that it should not be publish'd. but before yow putt the finishing hand to it it is really necessary to be acquainted wth some new improvements of mankind that have appeared of late and are dayly appearing. Mankind has an inexhaustible source of invention in the way of folly, & madness. I have only one fear, that when yow come over yow will be so much cuveted & taken up by the Ministry, that unless your freind's meett you at their tables, they will have none of Your company: this is really no joke; I am quite in earnest. Your deafness is so necessary a thing, that I allmost begin to think it is an affectation. I remember yow usd to reckon dinners. I know of near half a years dinner's where you are allready bespoke. It is worth your while to come to see our old freind Lewis who is wiser than ever he was the best of husbands. I am sure I can say from my own experience, that he is the best of freind's. he was so to me when he had little hope I should ever live to thank him. Yow must acquaint me before yow take [your] jurney, that we may provide a convenient Lodging for yow amongst your Freinds.
I am call'd away this moment, & have only time to add that I long to see yow, & am most sincerely, Dr Sir Your most faithfull humble servt

Laying aside the superiority of your dignity, I thought a notification was due to me as well as to two others of my friends. then I considered that this was done in the publick newes with all the formalitys of Reception of a Lord Lieutenant. I reflected on the dependancy of Ireland, but said I what if my friend should dispute this? then I considered that Letters were allwayes introduced at first from the civiliz'd to the Barbarous Kingdom . . . in short my affection, & the pleasure of corresponding with my dear friend prevail'd, & since you most disdainfully & Barbarously confined me to two lines a month, I was resolv'd to plague you with twenty times that Number. Tho I think it was a sort of a Compliment to be suppos'd capable of saying any thing in two lines. The Gascoygne asked only to speak one word to the ffrench King which the King confining him to, he Brought a paper & said signez & not a word more. Your negotiation with the singing man is in the hands of my daughter Nancy who I can assure you, will neglect nothing that concerns you. She has wrote about it. I beleive you did not gett receipts for your subscribers, which they ought to have had, however I shall Lodge the names with Mr Tonson that they may call for the books. Mr Pope has been in hazard of his life by drowning, coming Late two weeks ago from Lord Boling-broke's in his Coach & Six a Bridge on a little River being broke down they were obligd to go through the water which was not too high but the Coach was overturnd in it & the Glass being up, which he could not break nor get down, he was very near drowned; for the footman was stuck in the mud, & could hardly come in time to help him he had that common with Horace, that it was occasioned by the trunk of a tree but it was trunco Rhaeda illapsa neq3 faunus fatum dextra levabat for he was wounded in the left hand, but thank god without any danger but by the cutting of a Large vessel lost a great dale of blood. I have been with Mrs Howard who has had a most intolerable pain in one side of her head. I had a great dale of discourse with your freind her Royal Highness. She insisted upon your witt & good Conversation. I told her R. Highness that was not what I valu'd you for, but for being a sincere honest man & speaking truth when others were afraid to speak it. I have been for near three weeks together every day at the Duchess of Marlborough's with Mr Congreve who has been like to dye with a fever, & the gout in his stomach, but he is better, & like to do well. My Brother was like to be cast away, going to France there was a ship lost just by him.

London, 5 November 1726.
I take it mighty kindly that a man of your high post, Dear Sir, was pleased to write me so long a letter. I look upon the captain Tom of a great Nation to be a much greater Man than the Governour of it.
I am sorry your commission about your singer has not been executed sooner, it is not Nanny's Fault, who has spoke severall times to Dr Pepush about it, & wrote three or four letters, & received for answer that he would write for the young fellow; but still nothing is done, I will endeavour to gett his name & direction & write to him my self.
Your books shall be sent as directed; they have been printed above a month, but I cannot gett my subscribers names. I will make over all my profits to you, for the property of Gulliver's Travells, which I believe, will have as great a Run as John Bunian. Gulliver is a happy man that at his age can write such a merry work.
I made my Lord ArchBishop's compliment to her R Highness who returns his Grace her thanks, at the same time Mrs Howard Read your letter to herself. The princess immediately seizd on your plade for her own use, & has orderd the young Princesses to be clad in the same. when I had the honor to see her She was Reading Gulliver, & was just come to the passage of the Hobbling prince, which she laughed at. I tell yow freely the part of the projectors is the leats Brilliant. Lewis Grumbles a little at it & says he wants the Key to it, & is dayly refining I suppose he will be able to publish like Barnevelt in time I gave your service to Lady Hervey She is in a little sort of a Miff, about a Ballad that was wrote on her to the tune of Molly Mog, & sent to her in the name of a begging poet. She was bitt & wrote a letter to the Begging poet & desired him to change two double entendres, which the Authors Mr Poulteny [and] Lord Chesterfield changd to single entendres. I was against that . . tho I had a hand in the first. She is not displeasd I believe, with the Ballad, but only with being Bitt.
Ther has been a comical paper about Quadrille describing it in terms of a Lewd debauch among four Ladys meetting four gallants two of a Ruddy & two of a swarthy complexion talking of their A—es &c. The Ridle is carried on in pretty strong terms! it was not found out a long time, the Ladys imagining it to be [a] reall thing begann to guess who were of the party. A great Minister was for Hanging the Author. in short it was made very good sport.
Gay has had a little feaver, but is pretty well recovered, so is Mr pope we shall meet at Lord BolingBrokes on Thursday in town, at dinner, & remember yow:
Gulliver is in every body's Hands Lord Scarborow who is no inventor of Storys told me that he fell in company with a Master of a ship, who told him that he was very well acquainted with Gulliver, but that the printer had Mistaken, that he livd in Wapping, & not in Rotherhith. I lent the Book to an old Gentleman, who went immediately to his Map to search for Lilly putt.
We expect War here. The city of London are all crying out for it that they shall be undone without it. Ther being now a totall stoppage of all trade. I think one of the best Courses will be to Rig out a privateer for the west Indies, will yow be concernd we will build her at Bermudas, & get Mr Dean Berkley to be our Manager
I had the honor to see Lord Oxford, who askd kindly for yow, & said he would write to yow. if the project gos on for printing some papers he has promised to give copys of some things, which I beleive cannot be found else where My family thank god are pretty well as far as I know. & give you their service. My brother Robert has been very ill of a Rheumatism Wishing yow all health & happiness & not daring to write my paper on the other side I must remain

My Noble Lord,
— I am sorry the bad weather allows your lordship so much time for study in the Country. Tho I reckon that ev'n in the most serene day, one can hardly leave Guliver. There has been a vast dem[and] for Guliver the first impression was sold off in a moment every body has been mightily delighted with him, I had the honor to wait on her R. Highness when she had just come to that passage of the Hobling prince, which her Highness Laugh'd at. Minesterial folks say the book is a pleasant humorous book & it was pity he descended so low, as some Little satyr, that is too particular some Folks that I know went immediately to their Maps to look for Lillypott, & reckond it a fault in their Maps not to have sett down. Lord Scarborrow Mett with a Sea Captain that Knew Guliver but he said the bookseller was mistaken in placing his habitation at Rothereth for he was sure he livd at Wapping. in short the Book has made very good diversion to all the town It was not possible for me at this Time to send the Ballad but your lordship shall have it ther are a hundred incorrect Copys of it about town. I have just now transcribed the substance of the paper of Quadrille. I fancy there will be some comical papers about Guliver. I have seen a pretty good Epistle from Guliver's wife to him in the Stile of ovid. I happen to be so unlucky as to have twenty things to do this moment else your lordship should have had the Ballad & for the same reason I hope you will be so good as to forgive this hasty & hardly legible scrawl being with the utmost respect

I have heard Dear Sir with great pleasure of your safe arrivall & which is more of the recovery of your health; I think it will be the best expedient for me to take a Jurney. Yow will know who the enclosed comes from, & I hope yow will value mine for what it contains: I think every one of your freinds have heard from you except my self. either yow have not done me justice or your freinds have not done yow, for I have not heard from them of my name being mentiond, in any of your letters. if my curiosity wanted only to be gratifyd I dont stand in need of a Letter from your self to inform me what yow are doing, for ther are people about Court who can tell me every thing that yow do or say so that yow had best take care of your Conduct yow see of what importance you are . . how ever all quarels aside; I must ask yow if yow have any interest; or do yow think that I could have or procure any with My Lord Lieutent to advance a relation of mine one Captain Innes, I think in Co͞ll Wilson's Regiment & now in Limerick; he is an exceeding worthy man, but has stuck long in a low post for want of freinds. pray tell me which way I shall proceed in this matter. I was yesterday with all your friends at St James's. Ther is certainly a fatality upon poor Gay. as for hopes of preferment by favour these he has laid aside, he had made a pretty good bargain, that is a Smithfield one; for a little place in the custom house which was to bring him in about a hundred a year. it was done as a favour to an old Man, & not at all to Gay. when every thing was concluded, the man repented, & said he would not part with his place. I have begd Gay not to buy an annuity upon my life. Ime sure I should not live a week. I long to hear of the safe arrival of Dr Delany. pray give my humble service to him.
As for newes it was wrote from Spain; to me from my Brother in France that the preliminarys were ratify'd & yet the Ministry know nothing of it nay some of them told me ⎡that the answer was rather surly.⎤ Lord Townsend is very ill but I think by the description of his case it is not Mortal. I was with our friend; at the Back Stair's yesterday & had the honor to be call'd in & prettily chid for leaving off, &c. The first part of the discourse was about Yow Mr Pope Curle & myself. my family are well, they & my Brother in France, & one that is here all give their service to yow; if yow had been so lucky as to have gone to Paris last summer yow would have health, honor, & diversion, in abundance; for Ile promise yow would have recover'd of the spleen.I shall add no more but my kindest wishes & that I am with the greatest affection & respect 
Yours &c

This is the second or third time Dear Sir that I have wrote to yow; without hearing a word of You or from you; only in general, that you were very much out of order, sometimes of your two old complaints the vertigo & deafness, which I am very sorry for. The gentleman who carrys this has come better off than I did imagine, I us'd my little interest as far as it would go in his affairs. he will be able to give yow some account of your friends many of whom have been in great distress this winter, John Gay I may say with vanity owes his life under god, to the unwearied endeavours & care of your humble servant for a physician who had not been passionately his friend could not have savd him. I had besides my personal concern for him, other motives of my case he is now become a publick person a little Sacheverel, & I took the same pleasure in saving him, as Ratcliff did in preserving My Lord chief Justice Holt's wife whom he attended out of spite to the husband who wishd her dead.
The inoffensive John Gay is now become one of the obstructions to the peace of Europe, the terror of Ministers, the chief author of the Craftsman & all the seditious pamphlets which have been published against the government. he has gott several turnd out of their places, the greatest ornament of the court Banishd from it for his sake, another great Lady in danger of being chasé likewise, about seven or eight duchesses pushing forward like the ancient Circum Celliones in the Church who shall suffer Martyrdome upon his account first, he is the darling of the city; if he should travel about the country, he would have hecatombs of Roasted oxen sacrified to him. Since he became so conspicuous Will poultny hangs his head; to see himself so much outdone in the career of Glory. I hope he will gett a good dale of money by printing his play. but I really believe he would gett more by showing his person: and I can assure you this is the very identical John Gay whom yow formerly knew & lodgd with in Whitehall two years ago. I have been diverting my self with making an extract out of a History which will be printed in the year 1948 I wish I had your assistance to go through with it for I can assure yow it riseth to a very solemn piece of Burlesque.
As to the condition of your little club, it is not quite so desperate as you might imagine, for Mr Pope is as high in favour as I am affraid the rest are out of it. The King upon the perusal of the last edition of his Dunciad, Declard he was a very honest Man.I did not know till this moment, that I had so good an opportunity to send yow a letter & now I know it I am calld away and obligd to end with my best wishes & respects being most sincerely yours &c.

Dear Sir
I have wrote three times to Mr Dean of St patricks without receaving so much as an acknowledgment of the receipt of my Letters; at the same time I hear of other Letters, which his acquaintances receave from him. I beleive I should hardly have brought my self to have wrote this were it not to serve you & a freind at the same time. I recommended one Mr Mason son of Mason Gentleman of the Queens Chappell, a Baritone Voice, for a vacancy of a Singer in your Cathedral this Letter was wrote from Bath Last September The same Mason informs me that ther is another Vacancy. therfor I renew my request. I beleive you will hardly gett a better. he has a pleasant mellow voice & has sung severall times in the Kings chappell this winter, to the satisfaction of the Audience. I beg at least your Answer to this. Your freinds in town, such as I know are well Mr pope is happy again, in having his mother recoverd Mr Gay is gone to Scotland with the Duke of Queensbury. he has about twenty Law suits with booksellers, for pyrating his book. The King gos soon to Hanover. These are all the news I know. I hope yow don't imagine I am so Little concernd about your health as not to desire to be informd of the state of it from your self. I have been tolerably well this winter I thank god. My Brother Robin is here & longs as well as I to know how yow do. This with my best wishes & respects from

[In part:] Your friends whom you mention in yours are well; Mr Gay is returnd from Scotland, & has recoverd his strength by his journey. Mr Pope is well. he had gott an injunction in chancery against the printers who had pyrated his dunciad; it was dissolv'd again because the printer could not prove any property nor did the Author appear. that is not Mr Gays case for he has own'd his book. Mr Poulteny gives you his service.
They are all better than my self, for I am now so bad of a constant convulsion in my heart, that I am like to expire sometimes We have no news that I know of . . . .

Dear Sir
This is givn you by Mr Mason; whom I believe you will find answer the character I gave of him; which really was not partial; for I am not so much as acquainted with his father or him self. I explaind every thing to him according to the tenor of the letter which I receaved from you some time ago and for which I most heartily thank you . . . Lett him now speak for himself I have been enquiring about a Counter tenor; but have as yet no intelligence of any.
I am really sensibly touchd with the account you give of Ireland. it is not quite so bad here but really bad enough; at the same time we are told that we are in great plenty & happiness. Your freinds whom you mention in yours are well; Mr Gay is returnd from Scotland, & has recoverd his strength by his jurney. Mr pope is well. he had gott an injunction in chancery against the printers who had pyrated his Dunciad; it was dissolv'd again because the printer could not prove any property, nor did the Author appear, that is not Mr Gays case for he has own'd his book. Mr Poulteny gives you his service. They are all better than my self. for I am now so bad of a constant convulsion in my heart that I am like to expire sometimes.
We have no news that I know off. I am apt to beleive that in a little time this matter of the provisional treaty will be on or off The young Man waits for my [letter] I shall trouble you no more at present but remain with my best wishes & most sincere affection
Dear Sir

Dear Sir
The passage in Mr popes Letter about your health dos not alarm me, both of us have had this distemper these 30 years. I have found that Steel the warm Gumms & the Bark all do good in it. therefor first take the Vomit A, then every day the quantity of a Nutmeg in a Morning of the Electuary markd B with five spoonfuls of the Tinctur marked D. take the Tinctur; but not the Elect in the afternoon yow may take one of the pills marked C at any time when yow are troubld with it or 30 of the drops markd E in any vehicle evn water. I had a servant of my owne that was cur'd merely with vomiting. Ther is another medicine not mentiond which you may trye the pull Rad [Val] sylvestris about a scruple of it twice a day. how came yow to take it in your head that I was Queens physician, when I am so you shall be a bishop, or any thing yow have a mind to. pope is now the great Reigning poetical Favourite. your Lord Lieutenant has a mind to be well with you. Lady Betty Germain complains yow have not wrote to her, since she wrote to you I have showd as much civility to Mrs Barber as I could, & she likewise to me. My family especially Nanny, gives yow her service. I have no more paper, but what serves to tell yow, that I am, with great sincerity
Your most faithfull humble 
servant

I recommended Dr Helsham to be physician to the Lord Lieutenant I know not what effect it will have. My respects to him and Dr DeLany.

My Dear Freind
I had the pleasure of receaving one from yow by ⎡Mr Pilkington⎤ I thank yow for the opportunity it gave me of being acquainted with a very agreeable ingenious man. I value him amongst other things for his musick which yow give yourself an air of contemning. & I think I treated him in that way to a degree of surprise.
I have had but a melancholy sorrowfull life for some time past having Lost my Dear child, whose life if it had so pleasd god I would have willingly redeemd with my own I thank god for a new Lesson of submission to his will & likewise for what he has left me.
We have all had another loss of our worthy & Dear freind Mr Gay . . it was some alleviation of my grief to see him so universaly lamented by allmost every body; evn by those who knew him only by reputation. he was interrd at Westminster Abby. as if he had been a peer of the Realm & the good Duke of Queensberry who lamented him as a brother will sett up a handsome monument upon him. These are little affronts putt upon Vice & injustice and is all that Remains in our power. I beleive the Beggars opera & what he has to come upon the stage will make the summ of the diversions of the town for some time to come. Curle (who is one of the new terrors of Death) has been writing Letters to every body for memoirs of his life. I was for sending him some particularly an account of his disgrace at court which I am sure might have been made entertaining by which I should have attained two ends at once publishd truth & gott a Rascal whipd for it. I was over ruld in this. I wish yow had been here tho I think yow are in a better country. I fancy my self that you have some virtue & honor left, some small regard for religion. perhaps christianity may last with you at least twenty or thirty years longer. yow have no companys nor stockjobbing, are yet free of excises, yow are not insulted in your poverty, & told with a sneer that you are a rich & a thriving nation. every man that takes neither place nor pension is not deemd with yow a Rogue and an enimy to his Country.
Your freinds of my acquaintance are in tolerable good health, Mr Pope has his usual complaints of head ach & indigestion I think more than formerly, he really leads sometimes a very irregular life, that is lives with people of superiour health and strength. yow will see some new things of his, equal to any of his former productions. he has affixed to the new edition of his Dunciad a royal Declaration against the Haberdashers of points & particles assuming the title of criticks & restorers, wherein he declares that he has revis'd carefully this his Dunciad, beginning and ending so & so consisting of so many lines and declares this edition to be the true reading & it is signed by John Barber major civitatis Londini
I remember yow with your freinds, who are my neighbours. They all long to see yow;
As for newes, there is nothing here talkd of but the new scheme of excise. you may Remember that a Ministry in the Queens time possessed of her Majesty the pa rli at, army, fleet, treasury, confederate, &c, putt all to the test by an experiment of a silly project of the tryal of a poor parson. the same Game, in my mind, is playing over again from a wantonness of power. Miraberis quam pauca sapientia mundus regitur.
I have considered the greivance of your wine. The freind that designed you good wine was abused by an agent that he entrusted his affairs to. it was not this gentlemans brother whose name is De La Mar, to whom show what freindship you can. My brother is getting money now in china less & more honestly than his predecessors supercargos but enough to make you satisfaction, which if he comes home alive he shall do. My neighbour the proseman is wiser & more cowardly & despairing than ever. he talks me into a fitt of vapours twice or thrice a week. I dream at night of a chain & Rowing in the Gallys. but thank god he has not taken from me the freedom I have been accustomd to in my discourse even with the greatest persons to whom I have access, in defending the Cause of Liberty Virtue & religion. for the last I have the satisfaction of suffering some share of the ignominy that belonged to the first confessors. This has been my lott from a steady resolution I have taken of giving these ignorant impudent fellows battle upon all occasions.My family send you their best wishes & a happy new year: & none can do it more heartily than my self who am, with the most sincere respect Your most faithfull humble servt

Hampstead, July 17, 1734
I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you mention. I have nothing to repay my Friends with at present, but prayers and good wishes. I have the satisfaction to find that I am as officiously serv'd by my Friends, as he that has thousands to leave in Legacies; besides the Assurance of their Sincerity. God Almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be: I have found some relief, at least sometimes, from the Air of this Place. My Nights are bad, but many poor Creatures have worse.
As for you, my good Friend, I think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little Suspicions or Jealousies that often affect the sincerest Friendships; I am sure not on my side. I must be so sincere as to own, that tho' I could not help valuing you for those Talents which the World prizes, yet they were not the Foundation of my Friendship: They were quite of another sort; nor shall I at present offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Last Request, that you continue that noble Disdain and Abhorrence of Vice, which you seem naturally endu'd with, but still with a due regard to your own Safety; and study more to reform than chastise, tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other.
Lord Bathurst I have always honour'd for every good Quality, that a Person of his Rank ought to have: Pray give my Respects and kindest Wishes to the Family. My Venison Stomach is gone, but I have those about me, and often with me, who will be very glad of his Present. If it is left at my house it will be transmitted safe to me.
A Recovery in my Case, and at my Age, is impossible; the kindest Wish of my Friends is Euthanasia. Living or dying, I shall always be
Your most faithful Friend, 
And humble Servant, 
Jo. Arbuthnot.

[Hampstead 4 October 1734]
My Dear & worthy freind
You have no reason to putt me amongst the rest of your forgettfull freinds for I wrote two Long Letters to yow to which I never receaved one word of answer The first was about your health, the last I sent a great while ago by one Mr De La mar. I can assure yow with great truth, that none of your friends or aquaintances has a more warm heart towards yow than my self I am going out of this troublesome world, & yow amongst the rest of my freinds shall have my last prayers & good wishes.
The young man whom yow recommended came out to this place, & I promisd to do him what service my ill state of health would permit I came out to this place so reduced by a dropsy and an Asthma that I could neither sleep breath eat nor move. I most earnestly desir'd, & beggd of god that he would take me, contrary to my expectation, upon venturing to Ride (which I had forborn for some years because of bloody water) I recovered my strength to a pretty considerable degree slept & had my stomach return. but I expect the return of my symptoms upon my return to London & the return of the winter, & I am not in circumstance to lead an idle country life & no man at my age ever Recover'd of such a disease further than by an abatement of the symptoms. what I did I can assure yow, was not for life but ease; for I am at present in the case of a man that was allmost in harbour & then blown back to Sea; who has a reasonable hope of going to a good place & an absolute certainty of leaving a very bad one not that I have any particular disgust at the world for I have as great comfort in my own family. and from the kindness of my freinds as any man, but the world in the main displeaseth me, & I have too true a presentiment of Calamitys that are like to befall my country. however if I should have the happiness to see yow before I die yow will find that I enjoy the comforts of life with my usual cheerfulness.
I cannot imagine why yow are frighted from a journey to Ingland; the reasons yow assign I am sure are not sufficient; the journey I am sure would do you good. In general I recommend Riding, of which I have allways had a great opinion, & can now confirm it by my own experience.
My family give yow their Love & service the great loss I sustaind in one of them gave me my first shock & the trouble I have with the rest to bring them to temper to bear the loss of a father who loves them & whom they love is really a most sensible affliction to me. I am affraid My Dear freind we shall never see one another more in this world. I shall to the last moment preserve my love & esteem for yow being well assured yow will never leave the paths of virtue & honor for all that is in this world is not worth the least deviation from that way. It will be great pleasure to me to hear from yow sometimes. for none can be with more sincerity than I am 
My Dear freind 
Your most faithfull Freind & 
humble servant
