THE INTELLIGENCER
Jonathan Swift and Thomas Sheridan


This disk contains the text of THE INTELLIGENCER as established
by me for the Oxford University Press edition, forthcoming.

THE INTELLIGENCER is a series of twenty periodical essays
written by Jonathan Swift and Thomas Sheridan and published in
Dublin 1728-9. Swift was responsible for nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9,
10, 15, 19, and 20. The authorship of no. 12 is unknown. Sheridan
wrote the others and, as editor of the periodical, also wrote
introductions to some of Swift's numbers. 

The text is in 20 files, INT1 - INT20. The files are MS-DOS
ASCII files written in Nota Bene 3.0. The only codes
not standard to Nota Bene are these:

	\}\ = begin 3-line right brace
	\2}\ = begin 2-line right brace
	\note begin\ = begin footnote
	\note end\ = end footnote
	 = begin small caps (Nota Bene MD SD code)
	 = turn off italics or small caps

The word transliterated as `aischrokerdeis' in no. 4 appears 
in Greek characters in the printed text.

I can make available other portions of the printed OUP edition 
in machine-readable form.
