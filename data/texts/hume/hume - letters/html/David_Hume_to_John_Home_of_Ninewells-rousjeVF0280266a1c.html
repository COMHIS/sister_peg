He applyd to me last Summer to take him under my Protection in England<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, as he calld it; but in the mean while, he was chac'd out of Switzerland, and came to Strasbourg, with an Intention of going to the King of Prussia, who pressd him earnestly to live with him. At Strasbourg my Letter reachd him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, making him an Offer of all my Services, upon which he turn'd short, and having obtained the King <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> of France's<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Passport came and joind me at Paris. I have liv'd with him ever since: He is very modest, mild, well-bred, gentle-spirited and warm-hearted Man, as ever I knew in my Life: He is also in appearance very sociable: I never saw a man who seems better calculated for good Company nor who seems to take more Pleasure in it; <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> yet is he<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> absolutely determind to retire and board himself in a Farmer's House among the Mountains of Wales <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> for the sake of Solitude<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>. He has refus'd a Pension from the King of Prussia and Presents from hundreds: I have been offerd great Sums for him, if I cou'd have prevaild on him to accept of them: Yet till within these three Months he was in absolute Beggary: He has now about 70 pounds a [year]<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> which he has acquird by a Bargain, for his Works. It is incredible the Enthusiasm for him in Paris and the Curiosity in London. I prevaild on him to go to the Play-house, in order to see Garrick, who placd him in a Box opposite the King and Queen<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>. I observd their Majestys to look at him, more than at the Players. I shoud desire no better Fortune than to have the Privilege of showing him to all<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> I please. The hereditary Prince<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280266a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> payd him a Visit a few days ago; and I imagine the Duke of York calld on him one Evening when he was abroad.
