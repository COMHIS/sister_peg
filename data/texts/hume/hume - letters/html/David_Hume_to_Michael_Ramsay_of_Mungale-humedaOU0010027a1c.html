	<div id="humedaOU0010027a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">Feby. 22 [1739]</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Michael</p><p><span class="linefirst">This is the fourth Letter I have wrote you, since you left London.</span> The failing of the former will make me more concise in this. I shall only repeat what I told you at large, that as far as I can judge you stand very well with all my L Marchmont's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> Family, &amp; may depend upon their Friendship as much as ever. I expect every hour to have a Call from a Ship to go to Scotland; but shall endeavour to meet with some of the Family before I go, in order to consult with them about your Affairs, &amp; consider whether your Absence will not be a prejudice to you. You shall hear of it in the Postscript. In the mean time I must declare it as my Opinion, that nothing can be done effectually without your presence; tho' I think this can be no reason for your leaving Mr Home,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> since the Difference will only be of a few Months.</p><p>As to myself, no Alteration has happen'd in my Fortune, nor have I taken the least Step towards it. I hope things will be riper next Winter; &amp; I wou'd not aim at any thing till I cou'd judge of my Success in my grand Undertaking, &amp; see upon what footing I shall stand in the World. I am afraid, however, that I shall not have any great Success of a sudden. Such Performances make their way very heavily at first, when they are not recommended by any great Name or Authority.</p><p>I do not despair but some of my former Letters may yet reach you; for which reason I shall repeat nothing, but what I must always repeat to you; that I am with the greatest Sincerity Your affectionate Friend</p><p>D. H.</p><p>I have had a Conversation with Mr Hume<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> since I wrote this. He is entirely of my Opinion, that nothing can be done till you be on the place. For shou'd a Living fall in the Gift of the Dutchess of Marlborough<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> or any other of your Friends, &amp; Patrons, 'twou'd have but an ill Air to say, that the Gentleman was in the South of France, &amp; that he shoud be inform'd of the Matter. Besides you know, how necessary a Man's Presence is to quicken his Friends, to make them unite their Interests; &amp; to save them the Trouble of contriving &amp; thinking about his Affairs. Many a one may endeavour to serve you, when you point out the Service you desire of them, who wou'd not take the [?Pains] of finding it out themselves.</p><p>I saw My Lord Polwarth;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> but he was with some great Folks, who carry'd him away, &amp; did not give me an opportunity of speaking to him. I think it were proper you shou'd write to my Lord to inform [him]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010027a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> that you have left the Commissions of Wine in a Friend's hand w[hom] you wou'd write to, if his Ldp woud please to inform you. For [to] desire him to write himself to a Person he does not know, I do [not] think so proper.</p><p>My kind Service to Mr Home; &amp; let him know how great Joy his R[ecovery] has given me &amp; all his Friends here. A propos My Lord Home is at [?] of a petition to the Parliament agst My Lord Marchmont about th[e Sherriff] Court. My Lord spoke to me with great Resentment of it; but upon [my] mentioning something of our Friend he said there was all the Diff[erence] in the World betwixt the two Brothers, &amp; that Mr Home seem'd to be [the finest] Boy in the World. By this you may see, that so far from involving you in these Quarrels, they even distinguish betwixt the two Brothers. <span class="linelast">[I have] inform'd you of other particulars in former Letters.</span></p></div>
