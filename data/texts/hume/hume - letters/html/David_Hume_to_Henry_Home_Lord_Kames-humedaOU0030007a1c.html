	<div id="humedaOU0030007a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Ninewells</span> <span class="date">13 June 1742</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I agree with you, that Cicero's Reasonings in his Orations are very often loose, &amp; what we shou'd think to be wandering from the Point; insomuch that nowadays a Lawyer, who shoud give himself such Liberties, wou'd be in danger of meeting with a Reprimand from the Judge or at least of being admonish'd of the Point in Question.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> His Orations against Verres, however, are an Exception; tho that Plunderer was so impudent &amp; open in his Robberies, that there is the less Merit in his Conviction &amp; Condemnation. However these Orations have all a very great Merit.</p><p>The Oration for Milo is commonly esteem'd Cicero's Masterpiece; &amp; indeed is in many Respects very beautiful; but there are some Points in the Reasoning of it, that surprize me. The true Story of the Death of Clodius, as we learn from the <em>Roman</em> Historians was this.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> It was only a causal Rencontre betwixt Milo &amp; him, &amp; the Squabble was begun by their Servants, as they past each other on the Road. Many of Clodius's Servants were killd, the rest disperst, &amp; himself wounded, &amp; oblig'd to hide himself in some neighbouring Shops; from whence he was dragg'd out by Milo's Orders, &amp; kill'd in the Street. These Circumstances must have been largely insisted upon by the Prosecutors, &amp; must have been prov'd too, since they have been receiv'd as Truth by all Antiquity. But not a Word of them in Cicero, whose Oration only labours to prove two Points, that Milo did not way-lay Clodius, and that Clodius was a bad Citizen, &amp; it was meritorious to kill him. If you read his Oration, you'll agree with me, I believe, that he has scarce spoke any thing to the Question, as it wou'd now be conceivd by a Court of Judicature.</p><p>The Orations for Marcellus &amp; Ligarius as also that for Archias are very fine, &amp; chiefly because the Subjects do not require or admit of close Reasoning. Tis worth your while to read the Conclusion of the Oration for Plancius, where I think the Passions are very well touch'd. There are many noble Passages in the Oration for Murena; tho' tis certain, that the Prosecutors (which however were Servius Sulpicius &amp; Cato) must either have said nothing to the Purpose, or Cicero has said nothing. There is some of that Oration lost.</p><p>Twou'd be a Pleasure<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> to you to read &amp; compare the two first Phillipics, that you may judge of the Manners of those times, compar'd to modern Manners. When Cicero spoke the first Phillipic Anthony &amp; he had not broke all Measures with each other, but there were still some Remains of a very great Intimacy &amp; Friendship betwixt them; And besides Cicero liv'd in a close Correspondence with all the rest of Caesar's Captains; Dolabella had been his Son in Law; Hirtius &amp; Pansa were his Pupils: Trebatius was entirely his Creature. For this Reason Prudence lay'd him under great Restraints at that time in his Declamations against Anthony: there is a great Elegance &amp; Delicacy in them; &amp; many of the Thoughts are very fine, particularly where he mentions his Meeting with Brutus, who had been obligd to leave Rome, <em>I was asham'd</em>, says he, <em>that I durst return to Rome after Brutus had left, &amp; that I cou'd be in Safety where he cou'd not</em>. In short, the whole Oration is of such a Strain, that the Duke of Argyle might have spoke it in the House of Peers against my Lord Orford;<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and Decency wou'd not now allow the greatest Enemies to go farther. But this Oration is not much admir'd by the Antients. The Divine Phillipic, as Juvenal calls it,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> is the second, where he gives a full loose to his Scurrillity; &amp; without having any Point to gain by it, except vilifying his Antagonist, &amp; without supporting any Fact by Witnesses (for there was no Tryal or Accusation) he rakes into all the Filth of Anthony's Character, reproaches him, with Drunkenness, &amp; Vomiting, &amp; Cowardice &amp; Sodomy,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> &amp; every sort of Debauchery &amp; Villany. There is great Genius &amp; Wit in many Passages of this Oration; but I think the whole turn of it wou'd not now be generally admir'd.</p><p>I thank Mrs Home<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> for her Intelligence, &amp; have employ'd my Brain to find out the Person she means. It cou'd not be the Widow: For she toasts always the Duke of Argyle or Lord Stairs,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; never wou'd name a young Man, whom she may reasonably enough suppose to be in Love with her. I shall therefore flatter Myself it was Miss Dalrymple.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> It is now Exchequer Term: She is among the few <em>very fine Ladies</em> of Mrs Home's Acquaintance, whom I have the Happiness of knowing: In short, many Circumstances, besides my earnest Wishes, concur to make me believe it was she who did me that Honour. I will persevere in that Opinion; unless you think it proper to disabuse me; for fear of my being too much puft up with vanity by such a Conceit.</p><p>I am oblig'd to you for Vaugelas &amp; the Pamphlets.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> I fancy I have been misinform'd with Regard to Kincaid.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> The Essays are all sold in London; as I am inform'd by two Letters from English Gentlemen of my Acquaintaince. There is a Demand for them; &amp; as one of them tells me, Innys<span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> the great Bookseller in Paul's Church Yard wonders there is not a new Edition, for that he cannot find Copies for his Customers. I am also told that Dr Butler has every where recommended them. So that I hope they will have some Success. They may prove like Dung with Marle, &amp; bring forward the rest of my Philosophy, which is of a more durable, tho of a harder &amp; more stubborn Nature. You see, I can talk to you in your own Style. <span class="linelast"><span href="/item/humedaOU0030007a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> Adieu.</span></p><p class="datelineb"> <span class="date">June. 13. 1742.</span></p></div>
