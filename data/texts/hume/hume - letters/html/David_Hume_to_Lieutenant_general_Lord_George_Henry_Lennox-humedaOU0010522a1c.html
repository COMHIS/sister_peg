Changuion,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010522a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the passports for his horses and baggage, such as he desired them; and I suppose they have come safe to hand.</span> I also sent over last post to M. Secretary Conway another passport for his Grace's baggage, to prevent its being opened and searched till its arrival in Paris.</p><p>I hear my Lord Duke has taken the Hotel de Brancas, in which Lord Hertford lived, but that the Count de Lauragais<span href="/item/humedaOU0010522a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> would only consent that he should possess it till he could find another hotel. It is certain that the Count intends to dispose of that house to the Prince of Condé,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010522a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> who will probably purchase it as being extremely convenient for him. Two days ago I met with the Countess of Tolouse<span href="/item/humedaOU0010522a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> in the country, and heard her say that she had taken the hotel of the late Sardinian Ambassador, and was to leave her own, which consequently will be to be disposed of. I am told it is an excellent house, situated in the Fauxbourg St. Germain, and would suit my Lord Duke perfectly. I thought it proper to inform your Lordship of this incident, that you may communicate the matter to his Grace. I have also wrote to Sir John Lambert<span href="/item/humedaOU0010522a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> to the same purpose, in case he has any powers or instructions to make an offer to the proprietor.</p><p>I must beg the favour of your Lordship that you would inform me beforehand, as near as possible, of his Grace's arrival, that I may not lose a moment in paying my respects to his Grace and your Lordship. In particular, my Lord, I shall be very proud of having an opportunity to begin afresh my acquaintance with your Lordship, and of renewing a correspondence which, though interrupted by several years' absence, gave me formerly so much honour and satisfaction. <span class="linelast">Meanwhile, I shall be proud to execute any commands which your Lordship or the Duke of Richmond shall be so good as to impose upon me.</span></p></div>
