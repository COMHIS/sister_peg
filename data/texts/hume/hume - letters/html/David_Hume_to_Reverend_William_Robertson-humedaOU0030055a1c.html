	<div id="humedaOU0030055a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">29 May 1759</span></p><p class="salutation">My Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I had a Letter from Helvetius<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> lately, wrote before your Book arrivd at Paris.</span> He tells me, that the Abbé Prevot,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who had just finishd the Translation of my History, <em>paroit tres disposé a traduire l'histoire d'Ecosse que vient de faire Mons<sup>r</sup> Robertson</em>. If he be engagd by my Perswasion, I shall have the Satisfaction of doing you a real Credit &amp; Pleasure: For he is one of the best Pens in Paris.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p>I lookd with great Impatience in your new Edition for the Note you seemd to intend with regard to breach of the Capitulation of Perth; and was much dissappointed at missing it. I own, that I am very curious on that head. I cannot so much as imagine a Colour upon which that Accusation coud possibly be founded. The Articles of the Capitulation were only two; Indemnity to the Inhabitants, &amp; the Exclusion of French Soldiers. Now that Scotch national Troops were not Frenchmen and Foreigners seems pretty apparent: And both Knox &amp; the Manifesto of the Congregation acquit the Queen Regent of any Breach of the first Article, as I had observd in my Note to p. 422. This makes me suspect, that some Facts have escap'd me; and I beg you to indulge my Curiosity by informing me of them.</p><p>The chief Reason of my giving you the Trouble of this Letter is to speak to you of Ferguson's Professorship, which, I am told, is in imminent Danger of being lost, if some Remedy be not apply'd.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> It is hard, that two People of so much Merit as he &amp; Russel,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp; whom we all love so much, shoud be Competitors; but as Ferguson's Situation is so much more disadvantageous,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> he certainly calls for the Preference. But I can easily forsee, that Russels Reputation for Knowledge in that Science, his being present, &amp; his having so many personal Friends will certainly prevail; and Lord Milton,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> unless he stretches all his Authority, which he will not do, must infallibly be dissappointed. The only Expedient I can propose, is, that, in case you find Affairs running in that manner, you woud propose to have Ferguson appointed in Rouets<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> Place at Glasgow, which woud be a good Retreat for him, &amp; woud prevent a new Dissappointment to him, after so many he has undergone. I hope you will have this in your Eye: For as to all the Schemes of having Balfours<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> Place, they appear to me quite wild &amp; chimerical. Plague on Jardine,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> &amp; his Intrigues &amp; Politics! But if he loves Intrigues, let him embrace this Scheme, and endeavor to forward it. I know he admires &amp; esteems Orthodoxy; and I will warrant Ferguson as orthodox as Russel, or even as himself; so that he will have Credit in appearing for him.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p>Our Friend, Smith, is very successful here, &amp; Gerard<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> is very well receivd. The Epigoniad<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> I cannot so much promise for; tho' I have done all in my Power to forward it, particularly by writing a Letter to the critical Review, which you may peruse. I find, however, some good Judges profess a great Esteem for it; but <em>habent et sua fata libelli</em>:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> However, if you want a little Flattery for the Author (which I own is very refreshing to an Author) you may tell him, that Lord Chesterfield<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> said to me he was a great Poet. I imagine, that Wilkie will be very much elevated by Praise from an English Earl, and a Knight of the Garter, &amp; an Ambassador, &amp; a Secretary of State, &amp; a Man of so great Reputation. For I observe that the greatest Rustics are commonly most affected with such Circumstances.</p><p>Ferguson's Book<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> has a great deal of Genius, &amp; fine Writing, and will appear in time. I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">29 May 1759</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span></p><p>I wrote this with an Intention of showing it to Ferguson, before I sent it off; and accordingly have met with him: But to my great Dissappointment, I learn, that the Project of his succeeding Rouet is absolutely impracticable.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span> The Reasons are not fit to be wrote to you; but the thing is absolutely certain. Let that therefore be no part of your Scheme. I own, that it appears to me that the best Ressource for Ferguson in this Emergency consists in Russel's Friendship; and I know no man who is more capable than he of a generous Action, &amp; of sacrificing his own Interest to that of his Friend. If he insists absolutely upon having this Office, for aught I can see, he must have it: But what a cruel &amp; distressful Situation does it leave poor Ferguson! I beg of you Dear Robertson (and yet I am sure I need not) to employ your Thoughts &amp; Contrivances &amp; good Offices on this Occasion. Let Ferguson be elected instantly, if possible: Delays are infinitely dangerous:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/017" title="17 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">17</span> And if any Scheme can be afterwards fallen on to provide for him, I can answer for him, that he will allow this Professorship to fall into Russel's hands, for whom indeed it is very well calculated.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030055a1c/nts/018" title="18 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">18</span></p></div></div>
