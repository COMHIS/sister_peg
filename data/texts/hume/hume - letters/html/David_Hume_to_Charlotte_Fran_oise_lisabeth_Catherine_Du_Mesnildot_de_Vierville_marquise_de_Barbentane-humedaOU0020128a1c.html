Four Days ago, he fell from his Horse at hunting. He was taken up for Dead; and on Examination was found to have his Skull (sa crane) fractured in a most violent manner. A surgeon was immediatly sent for; a difficult Operation was successfully performed; and he was brought to his Senses. The Symptoms have ever since been very favourable; tho' his Situation is still very dangerous. It is impossible to conceive any one more universally regretted. No body believes that the Duke would survive his Son's Death: His Condition is in a great Measure concealed from Lady Tavistoke, who is six months gone with child. I sent about an hour ago to Bedford House that I might give you the most recent Account, and had a very favourable Answer. As it is thought, that the four first Days were most critical, there are now good hopes entertained of his Recovery.</p><p>M<sup>de</sup> de Boufflers wou'd probably tell you, that I am now, from a Philosopher, degenerated into a petty Statesman, and am entirely occupyed in Politics. I am too well acquainted with our usual Fluctuations and Revolutions to believe that this Avocation will be durable. But whatever I am or wherever I live, believe me to be, with great Sincerity, Dear Madam,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
