Young and old, noble and ignoble, witty and dull, laity and clergy, all the world are ambitious of a place amongst us, and on each occasion we are as much solicited by candidates as if we were to choose a Member of Parliament.... Our friend young Wedderburn has acquired a great character by the appearance he has made.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Wilkie the minister<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> has turned up from obscurity, and become a very fashionable man, as he is indeed a very singular one. Monboddo's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> oddities divert; Sir David's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> zeal entertains; Jack Dalrymple's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> rhetoric interests. The long drawling speakers have found out their want of talents, and rise seldomer. In short, the House of Commons was less the object of general curiosity at London than the Select Society at Edinburgh. The Robinhood, the Devil, and all other speaking societies,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> are ignoble in comparison. Such felicity has attended the seed which you planted. But what chiefly renders us considerable is a project of engrafting on the Society a scheme for the encouragement of arts and sciences and manufactures in Scotland, by premiums partly honorary, partly lucrative.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> A box is opened for donations, and about one hundred guineas have been given in. We hear of considerable sums intended by Lord Hopetoun,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> Morton,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> Marchmont,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> &amp;c., who desire to be members. Nine managers have been chosen; and to keep the business distinct from our reasoning, the first Monday of every month is set apart for these transactions, and they are never to be mentioned in our Wednesday meetings. Advertisements have been published to inform the public of our intentions.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> A premium, I remember, is promised to the best discourse on Taste,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> and on the Principles of Vegetation. These regard the belles lettres<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> and the sciences; but we have not neglected porter, strong ale, and wrought ruffles, even down to linen rags....</p><p>Your ‘Investigator’<span href="/item/humedaOU0010219a1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span> has been published this spring, and I find that it has met with a very good reception from the wits and the critics. In vain did I oppose myself, and assert it was not just metaphysics. <span class="linelast">They did nothing but laugh at me, and told me it was very entertaining, and seemed very reasonable.</span></p></div>
