I sent one to the Duke of Argyle,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> to Lord Lyttleton,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Horace Walpole,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Soames Jennyns,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> &amp; Burke,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> an Irish Gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty Treatise on the Sublime. Millar desird my Permission to send one in your Name to Dr Warburton.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> I have delayd writing to you till I cou'd tell you something of the Success of the Book, and coud prognosticate with some Probability whether it shoud be finally damnd to Oblivion, or shoud be registerd in the Temple of Immortality. Tho' it has been publishd only a few Weeks, I think there appear already such strong Symptoms, that I can almost venture to fortell its Fate. It is in short this — — But I have been interrupted in my Letter by a foolish impertinent Visit of one who has lately come from Scotland. He tells me, that the University of Glasgow intend to declare Rouets Office Vacant upon his going abroad with Lord Hope.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> I question not but you will have our Friend, Ferguson,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> in your Eye, in case another Project for procuring him a Place in the University of Edinburgh shou'd fail. Ferguson has very much polishd &amp; improvd his Treatise on Refinement,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> &amp; with some Amendments it will make an admirable Book, &amp; discovers an elegant &amp; a singular Genius. The Epigoniad, I hope, will do; but it is somewhat up-hill Work. As I doubt not but you consult the Reviews sometimes at present, you will see in the critical Review a Letter upon that Poem; and I desire you to employ your Conjectures in finding out the Author. Let me see a Sample of your Skill in knowing hands by your guessing at the Person.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> I am afraid of Lord Kaims's Law Tracts.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> A man might as well think of making a fine Sauce by a Mixture of Wormwood &amp; Aloes as an agreeable Composition by joining Metaphysics &amp; Scotch Law. However, the Book, I believe, has Merit; tho' few People will take the Pains of diving into it. But to return to your Book, and its Success in this Town, I must tell you —— A Plague of Interruptions! I orderd myself to be deny'd; &amp; yet here is one that has broke in upon me again. He is a man of Letters, &amp; we have had a good deal of literary Conversation. You told me, that you was curious of literary Anecdotes, and therefore I shall inform you of a few, that have come to my Knowlege. I believe I have mentiond to you already Helvetius's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> Book de l'Esprit. It is worth your Reading, not for its Philosophy, which I do not highly value, but for its agreeable Composition. I had a Letter from him a few days ago, wherein he tells me that my Name was much oftener in the Manuscript, but that the Censor of Books at Paris oblig'd him to strike it out.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span> Voltaire<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/017" title="17 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">17</span> has lately publishd a small Work calld <em>Candide, ou L'optimisme</em>. It is full of Springhtliness &amp; Impiety, &amp; is indeed a Satyre upon Providence, under Pretext of criticizing the Leibnitian System.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> I shall give you a Detail of it — —But what is all this to my Book? say you — —My Dear Mr Smith, have Patience: Compose yourself to Tranquillity: Show yourself a Philosopher in Practice as well as Profession: Think on the Emptiness, &amp; Rashness, and Futility of the common Judgements of Men: How little they are regulatd by Reason in any Subject, much more in philosophical Subjects, which so far exceed the Comprehension of the Vulgar. <em>Non si quid improba Roma, Elevet, accedas examenque improbum in illa, Perpendas trutina, nec te quaesiveris extra</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/018" title="18 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">18</span> A wise man's Kingdom is his own Breast: Or, if he ever looks farther, it will only be to the Judgement of a select few, who are free from Prejudices, &amp; capable of examining his Work. Nothing indeed can be a stronger Presumption of Falshood than the Approbation of the Multitude; and Phocion, you know, always suspected himself of some Blunder, when he was attended with the Applauses of the Populace.</p><p>Supposing, therefore, that you have duely prepard yourself for the worst by all these Reflections; I proceed to tell you the melancholy News, that your Book has been very unfortunate: For the Public seem disposd to applaud it extremely. It was lookd for by the foolish People with some Impatience; and the Mob of Literati are beginning already to be very loud in its Praises. Three Bishops calld yesterday at Millar's Shop in order to buy Copies, and to ask Questions about the Author: The Bishop of Peterborough<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/019" title="19 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">19</span> said he had passd the Evening in a Company, where he heard it extolld above all Books in the World.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> You may conclude what Opinion true Philosophers will entertain of it, when these Retainers to Superstition praise it so highly. The Duke of Argyle is more decisive than he uses to be in its Favour: I suppose he either considers it as an Exotic, or thinks the Author will be serviceable to him in the Glasgow Elections. Lord Lyttleton says, that Robertson &amp; Smith and Bower<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/020" title="20 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">20</span> are the Glories of English Literature. Oswald<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/021" title="21 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">21</span> protests he does not know whether he has reap'd more Instruction or Entertainment from it: But you may easily judge what Reliance can be put on his Judgement, who has been engagd all his Life in public Business &amp; who never sees any Faults in his Friends. Millar exults &amp; brags that two thirds of the Edition are already sold, &amp; that he is now sure of Success. You see what a Son of the Earth that is, to value Books only by the Profit they bring him. In that View, I believe it may prove a very good Book.</p><p>Charles Townsend,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/022" title="22 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">22</span> who passes for the cleverest Fellow in England, is so taken with the Performance, that he said to Oswald he wou'd put the Duke of Buccleugh under the Authors Care, &amp; woud endeavour to make it worth his while to accept of that Charge.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030051a1c/nts/023" title="23 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">23</span> As soon as I heard this, I calld on him twice with a View of talking with him about the Matter, &amp; of convincing him of the Propriety of sending that young Nobleman to Glasgow: For I coud not hope, that he coud offer you any Terms, which woud tempt you to renounce your Professorship: But I missd him. Mr Townsend passes for being a little uncertain in his Resolutions; so perhaps you need not build much on this Sally.</p><p>In recompense for so many mortifying things, which nothing but Truth coud have extorted from me, &amp; which I coud easily have multiply'd to a greater Number; I doubt not but you are so good a Christian as to return good for evil and to flatter my Vanity, by telling me, that all the Godly in Scotland abuse me for my Account of John Knox &amp; the Reformation &amp;c.</p><p>I suppose you are glad to see my Paper end, &amp; that I am obligd to conclude with <span class="linelast">Your humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
