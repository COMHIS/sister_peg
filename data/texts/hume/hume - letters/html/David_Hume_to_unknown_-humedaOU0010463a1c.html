The Plan, therefore of a new Epoch, namely the first of January 1749 instead of the commencement of hostilities in that year (the Epoch said by the Preliminaries) came originally from the East India Comp<sup>y</sup>. and from the English Ministers. But notwithstanding this fact I find that Mr Pinto's merits towards the Company are very considerable, as they have always been represented by the Duke of Bedford, and by Mr. Neville. For in the Letter from the Chairman to Mr. Wood, no other reason is assign'd for the Change of Epoch but the danger of Dispute or Ambiguity concerning the time of the Commencement of Hostilities. The Directors thought with great Appearance of reason that if they had discoverd the real state of the Case to the Ministry, the Secret might have taken Air, and come to the knowledge of the Enemy, who in that Case wou'd undoubtedly have adher'd with Firmness to the Epoch Established by the preliminaries. But tho' the reserve was founded on very plausible grounds, the necessary Consequence was that the Duke of Bedford finding the french Ministers exclaim against all Innovation in the preliminaries despair'd at first of obtaining the point; and not being apprized of its Importance, thought that he would be oblig'd to sign the Treaty, without making any Alteration in this particular. In this Critical moment, The Duke consulted Mr. Pinto, who had, it seems some Connexions in India and having very lately perus'd Dupleix's Memoirs was perfectly well acquainted with the State of Affairs in that part of the World: He first told his Grace, that Hostilities between the Companies did not commence till the 15<sup>th</sup> July 1749, and that, therefore, had the Epoch fixed by the Preliminaries been follow'd in the definitive treaty, all the Acquisitions of the french E: I: Company, preceding that date must have been restor'd to them. But on the first of July in the same year, the Subah of the Carnatic (if I remember right) had made to that Company very large Grants to the annual Amo<sup>t</sup> as Mr. Pinto calculates them of £700,000 all which if the Epoch was changed, must become the property of the English Company. The Duke of Bedford now sensible of the Importance of the dispute, which was unknown to the french Ministers, insisted Strenuously on the Change of Epoch &amp; prevaild. This is Mr. Pinto's real merit as I apprehend it. He did not point out the new Epoch, but he discover'd its Importance and prefer'd the Interests of England in a very Material point to those of France. At the same time the Duke of Bedford's vigilance deserves great praise, for seeking &amp; finding the best Intelligence from all Quarters and for knowing how to profit by it.</p><p>I have the honor to be with great regard Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obed<sup>t</sup> hble Ser<sup>t</sup></span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
