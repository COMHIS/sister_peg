The General's Answer was, that I was to be in town in a few days; and without my Consent and even full Approbation he woud take no Step in that Affair. You may believe, that I exhorted him to do so charitable an Action. I wish he may not find a Difficulty with the King, who is very much prejudicd against Rousseau. This Step of my old Friend confirms the Suspicion which I always entertain'd, that he thought he had Interest enough to obtain the Pension of himself, and that he had only pick'd a Quarrel with me in order to<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320173a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> free himself from the humiliating Burthen of Gratitude towards me. His Motives, therefore, were<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320173a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> much blacker than many seem to apprehend them.<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320173a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></p><p>A Gentleman told me, that he heard from the French Ambassador, that His Most Christian Majesty had given an Arret prohibiting under the severest Penalties the printing, vending or dispersing any Paper of Rousseau or his Partizans against me<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320173a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. I dine with the Ambassador<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320173a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> to day; so shall know the Truth of the Matter, which scarce appears credible. It is surely very honourable for me; but yet will occasion that strange Man to complain, that he is oppressd with Power all over the World.
