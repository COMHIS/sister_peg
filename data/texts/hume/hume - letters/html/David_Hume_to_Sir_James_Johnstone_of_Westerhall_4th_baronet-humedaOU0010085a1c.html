	<div id="humedaOU0010085a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I past all the day you left us with Mr Vincent, and he never mention'd a word of the proposal he made you: I saw him twice since, and he was equally silent.</span> I was in hopes that the cold manner in which you receiv'd it had discourag'd him; but at last he has wrote me about it, tho' without mentioning any particular terms, but referring to a conversation we shall have next week. I am determin'd to answer him as I told you, and afterwards to write, according to the sketch I show'd you, with the alterations you propos'd.</p><p>Meanwhile, I own to you, that my heart rebells against this unworthy treatment; and nothing but the prospect of depending entirely on you, and being independent of him, cou'd make me submit to it. I have fifty resolutions about it. My loss, in ever hearkening to his treacherous professions, has been very great; but, as it is now irreparable, I must make the best of a bad bargain. I am proud to say that, as I am no plotter myself, I never suspect others to be such, till it be too late; and, having always liv'd independent, and in such a manner as that it never was any one's interest to profess false friendship to me, I am not sufficiently on my guard in this particular.</p><p>I must beg of you, that, if you cannot prevail to have matters continue on the present footing (as you most approve of, and think most reasonable), you may propose at least, that the diminution be made only for the ensuing year, on account of the £100 remitted me before I came up. This will be less disagreeable and less disobliging; and will still leave the matter open for an ensuing year, when you may act as will then seem most suitable. If these people come hither this summer, I shall be expos'd to all the same or greater insolencies and insults; and nothing will be able to save me from them so much as this mark of regard and attention. I therefore repeat my request, that matters be put upon this footing if possible. You will then be better able to judge of the success of my endeavours, which are at present very promising. My way of living is more melancholy than ever was submitted to by any human creature, who ever had any hopes or pretensions to any thing better; and if to confinement, solitude, and bad company, be also added these marks of disregard, . . . I shall say nothing, but only that books, study, leisure, frugality, and independence, are a great deal better.</p><p>Whatever terms are propos'd to me, I must put you in mind of your promise, that this quarter at least, be left to me on the same terms as before, in case I shou'd refuse what are offer'd; for tho' I think with you that I am entitled to this small advantage, such a clause will prevent all chicane and dispute. I am sure you are too much my friend, and too reasonable, to advise me to accept of any other terms than what I mention'd. A friend or two in London, to whom I communicated this matter, are even averse to the same, and think I affront myself by admitting of any alteration; so that my mind is extremely divided about the matter. You have seen what a task I must sometimes undergo, and not always without danger. If I have any pretensions to parts and learning, they are both requisite in my present situation; the one to keep in friendship with a person of your friend's taste; the other to support this dismal solitude. My only crime has been too little dissimulation, and too strong an indignation at meeting with treachery and perfidiousness, where I did not expect it. But I need not insist further on this matter with you, who are as sensible as myself of the reasonableness of what I say.</p><p>I am fully persuaded that, if my Lady were but inform'd of this one circumstance, that her son rejected this proposal with disdain, it wou'd be sufficient; but I shall not mention it in my letter, because, as you observ'd very well, it will have more force, when urg'd by a friend.</p><p>Next to the saving me from this indignity, the greatest favour you can do me, is to bring the matter to a speedy issue. <span class="linelast">I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Weldehall</span> <span class="date">March 29, 1746.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S. Your friend's illness has been much slighter than usual.</p><p>Vincent mentions Major Johnstone, who travel'd with my Lord, and had but £150. But that gentleman never was fixt with him; he only kept a general inspection over him, without neglecting his other affairs, and might be pleas'd to take a jaunt abroad, on condition his charges might be borne. Besides, he was never affronted in this manner; and you are sensible that a man who is to be a friend and comrade to L. A. ought to be a gentleman, and treated as such. He thinks so himself. If my conduct has been not only irreproachable but laudable (bating perhaps too great openness and want of design and suspicion), I ought not to be treated as criminal. If it be not, I ought not to stay at all. Your friend cannot and will not see any company but one single person. On his conduct and discretion, must all the hopes you can have of his recovery depend. 'Tis strange so considerable sums shou'd be lavisht on apothecaries and physicians, who perhaps do hurt, and a moderate sum be grudg'd to one that sacrifices all his time to him. I say all this, not that I think it will escape you, but in order to vent my spleen and indignation. I confess I have chang'd opinions, even since I began to write this letter, and you need not be surpris'd if you find me of a different opinion when matters come to a decision, to what I was when I converst with you. Sure I am, that, if you cannot prevail to make me receive better treatment, my connexion with the family will be very short, and give me occasion all my life to reflect on the mischiefs arising from too great trust and confidence.</p></div></div>
