	<div id="humedaOU0020377a1c"><p>As former friend of my brother Lord Elibank I send you this letter to inform you that my proces was judged last tuesday to the great discontentment of my Enemys, notwithstanding the low and indecent cabals begun by the Duke of B—, continued by a troop of Irish, etc., etc., etc. This surely must give you a very high idea of the integrity of the French judges; and the more so, when I tell you that no body appear'd in my behalf, but the Countess of Boufflers, who from a nobleness of soul, and elevation of sentiments so very peculiar to herself, assisted me to oppose the torrent of oppression that was rushing on to overwhelm me in a country I had retired to when drove from my own and where, I will venture to say, I have lived for these 14 years in such a manner as did honour to my country, name, and family. The generous and inexpressible friendship of My Lady Boufflers upon this occasion, does infinitely more than recompence all the pain my Enemys have given me; as I prefer her good opinion, to that of all those who have so shamefully join'd against me in this most infamous scheme to ruin my reputation in a country I have every sort of reason to love and consider as my own.</p><p>I should not, indeed, have wonder'd at your credulity and partiality in my affair; after having read that part of your history where you treat the character of the most lovely, and the most unfortunate Queen Mary. As a Scotchman you certainly ought at least to have endeavour'd to have render'd her justice, and as Lord Elibank's friend you should not undoubtedly have join'd in destroying his Brother's honour; if Mary had not been butcher'd by the false and unrelenting Elizabeth, who brib'd all the historians, particularly your favourite and countryman Buchanan to traduce that most divine and amable creature, my brother would not have had the honnour and happiness of justifying her injur'd fame, which he most effectually has done, by the testimony of authentick records, to the eternal shame and confusion of the Venal tribe who have loaded her with infamy. If I had died before this affair had been <em>judged</em> the dull, heavy, and false reasonings of my enemy's might have injur'd my character, and probably, no body would have given themselves the trouble to have justified me. As a proof, Sir, I am not a revengefull man, if you marry that worthy Lady Mrs Blake or obtain from her letters wrote with the same warmth and friendship, as one I was obliged in my own vindication to produce to my judges in order to destroy a manifest lye she and her Nephew publish'd in one of their printed libels, you was so very obliging to distribute amongst the English, I will from the bottom of [my] soul pardon the injury's you have attempt'd to do me, if not I shall ever consider you as the most credulous and partial of all men.</p><p>I send you the traduction of Mrs Blake's letter, notwithstanding of which she makes her nephew sign a libell in which he affirms his father never apply'd to me for money.</p></div>
