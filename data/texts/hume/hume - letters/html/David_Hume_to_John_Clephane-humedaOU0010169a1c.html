	<div id="humedaOU0010169a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I need not inform you, that in certain polite countries, a custom prevails, of writing <em>letters de la nouvelle année</em>, and that many advantages result from this practice, which may seem merely ceremonious and formal.</span> Acquaintance is thereby kept up, friendship revived, quarrels extinguished, negligence atoned for, and correspondence renewed. A man who has been so long conscious of his sins, that he knows not how to return into the way of salvation, taking advantage of this great jubilee, wipes off all past offences, and obtains plenary indulgence; instances are not wanting of such reclaimed sinners, who have afterwards proved the greatest saints, and have even heaped up many works of supererogation. Will you allow me, therefore, dear Doctor, in consideration of my present penitence, and hopes of my future amendment, to address myself to you, and to wish you many and happy new years, <em>multos et felices</em>. May pleasures spiritual (<em>spirituels</em>) multiply upon you without a decay of the carnal. May riches increase without an augmentation of desires. May your chariot still roll along without a failure of your limbs. May your tongue in due time acquire the <em>social sweet garrulity</em> of age, without your teeth losing the sharpness and keenness of youth. May — but you yourself will best supply the last prayer, whether it should be for the recovery or continuance of the blessing which I hint at. In either case, may your prayer be granted, even though it should extend to the resurrection of the dead.</p><p>I must now set you an example, and speak of myself. By this I mean that you are to speak to me of yourself. I shall exult and triumph to you a little, that I have now at last— being turned of forty, to my own honour, to that of learning, and to that of the present age — arrived at the dignity of being a householder. About seven months ago, I got a house of my own, and completed a regular family; consisting of a head, viz myself, and two inferior members, a maid and a cat. My sister has since joined me, and keeps me company. With frugality I can reach, I find, cleanliness, warmth, light, plenty, and contentment. What would you have more? Independence? I have it in a supreme degree. Honour? that is not altogether wanting. Grace? that will come in time. A wife? that is none of the indispensable requisites of life.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> Books? that <em>is</em> one of them; and I have more than I can use. In short, I cannot find any blessing of consequence which I am not possessed of, in a greater or less degree; and without any great effort of philosophy, I may be easy and satisfied.</p><p>As there is no happiness without occupation, I have begun a work which will employ me several years, and which yields me much satisfaction. Tis a History of Britain, from the Union of the Crowns to the present time. I have already finished the reign of King James. My friends flatter me (by this I mean that they don't flatter me), that I have succeeded. You know that there is no post of honour in the English Parnassus more vacant than that of History. Style, judgement, impartiality, care — everything is wanting to our historians; and even Rapin,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> during this latter period, is extremely deficient. I make my work very concise, after the manner of the Ancients. It divides into three very moderate volumes; one to end with the death of Charles the First; the second at the Revolution; the third at the Accession, for I dare come no nearer the present times.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> The work will neither please the Duke of Bedford<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> nor James Fraser;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> but I hope it will please you and posterity. <span lang="grc">Κτῆμα εἰς ἀεί</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010169a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p><p> <span class="linelast">So, dear Doctor, after having mended my pen, and bit my nails, I return to the narration of parliamentary factions, or court intrigues, or civil wars, and bid you heartily adieu.</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh, Riddal's Land</span></span> <span class="date">5<sup>th</sup> January, 1753</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>When I say that I dare come no nearer the present time than the Accession, you are not to imagine that I am afraid either of danger or offence; I hope, in many instances, that I have shown myself to be above all laws of prudence and discretion. I only mean, that I should be afraid of committing mistakes, in writing of so recent a period, by reason of the want of materials.</p></div></div>
