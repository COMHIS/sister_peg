He made a very slight dinner yesterday, which he threw up, by his usual Practice, before we were aware, but which we shall guard strictly against for the future. He was very uneasy from low Spirits in reality, but as he say'd from great Pains, all that Evening.</p><p>To-day his Physic wrought pretty well; he eat pretty well, kept all; but still complain'd. However in the midst of his greatest Complaints Panaiotty desir'd him to rise and take a little Exercise, and in my sight, he try'd him with one of the rudest exercises in the Art of Fencing (which I remember had almost dislocated my whole Body when I try'd it) and yet he never complain'd.</p><p>He had to-day several short Fits of high spirits mixt with his low ones. This is not a history of the Weather, but of something as uncertain.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Sir Your most humble Servt,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D.
