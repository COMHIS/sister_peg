	<div id="humedaOU0020365a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">29 Aprile</span></p><p>In answer to your question, the Donquixotisme you mention never entered my head. I wish I could see you to answer honestly all your questions, for tho I had my share of follys with others, yet as my intentions were at bottom honest, I should open to you my whole budget, and lett you know many things which are perhaps ill represented, I mean not truly. I remember to have recommended to your acquaintance Mr Floyd, son to old David Floyd, at St Germains, as a man of good sense, honor, and honesty: I fear he is dead, he would have been of great service to you in a part of your history since 1688. A propos of history, when you see Helvetius, tell I desired you to enquire of him concerning a certain history; I fancy he will answer you with his usuall Frankness.</p><p>I do believe Mr Rousseau will find it impossible to live where he finds nobody who understand a word of what he sais, there occurs so often occasion, even of trifling things necessary, that it is a vexation not to understand the language of the country; I feel it often, tho I understand many words of German, such as kleigh, Nigh Noch, ter mighter Teyfel, and others, high sounding as here pronounced, and of which the Ter Tunder would I believe put to flight the delicate ears of the whole Town of Sienna.</p><p>I hear you are going to France this summer, if you will come to Frankfort on Mein, I will meet you there the end of July, and stay with you a fourtnight. Bon jour.</p><p>N.B. You have better roads than I, you are strong as a giant, and I am growing ten years older every month, so I think my offer fair.</p></div>
