If I had had the Honor to be longer known to you, you wou'd have found, that nothing cou'd oblige me more than a free Criticism &amp; Censure. Will you take my Word for it, and venture the Experiment? I know, that in many particulars, especially the Language, you wou'd be able, if you pleas'd to give me good Advice. I beg of you to remark, as you go along, such Words or Phrazes, as appear to you wrong or suspicious; and to inform me of them. You cou'd not do me a better Office: Notwithstanding all the Pains, which I have taken in the Study of the English Language, I am still jealous of my Pen.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010205a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> As to my Tongue, you have seen, that I regard it as totally desperate and irreclaimable.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010205a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p><p>Mr Hamilton is of Opinion, that your Countenance &amp; Protection wou'd be of Use to him in London. He is a very honest Man; and I dare venture to recommend him to your good Offices.
