	<div id="humedaOU0010316a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I came to Town about six Weeks ago, &amp; have been very busy during that time, in adding the Authorities to the Volumes of the Stuarts.</span> I find this a very laborious, but not unentertaining Occupation. I find myself oblig'd to read over again almost all my old Authors; &amp; besides adding the References, I take an Opportunity to correct a few Mistakes, to add some new Facts, &amp; to make Improvements on the whole. I fancy that I shall be able to put my Account of that Period of English History beyond Controversy. I am glad you have so near a Prospect of a new Edition.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010316a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></p><p>As soon as this Task is finish'd, I undertake the antient English History. I find the Advocates Library very well provided of Books on this Period; but before I finish I shall pass a considerable time in London, to peruse the Manuscripts in the Musæum.</p><p>There is one Dr Mackenzie<span href="/item/humedaOU0010316a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> here (the same Gentleman who wrote on Health &amp; long Life) who has compos'd a Book against me with regard to Q. Mary, where he treats me very roughly, as a virulent, determin'd Whig. I am not displeasd to be abusd by the violent of both Parties. The Book is not yet publishd. But the Booksellers will probably propose to you to take some Copies. I own that I think the Book will rather do me good.</p><p>I think that an Index will be very proper; and am glad, that you free me from the Trouble of undertaking that Task, for which I know myself to be very unfit.</p><p>I am surprizd that Strahan had not printed the Essay on the Coalition of Parties.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010316a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> He was very near it when I left London; &amp; his Press must have stopd other wise it had been printed off in a week after. It will be necessary to add the two new Essays to what remains of the Quarto Edition. Please send down half a dozen of Copies of the new Edition in Sheets for me, along with Kincaid &amp; Donaldson's Parcel.</p><p>I shall always desire to be remember'd to Mrs Millar; and hope to have the Pleasure of playing a Game of Whist with her in my House here next Summer. I fancy these long Journies will do you both a great deal of Service.</p><p>Please make my Compliments to Mr Strahan, &amp; Dr Douglas.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010316a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I congratulate you, as a good Citizen, on the late Successes of our Arms, &amp; on our Prospect of a good Peace, which, I hope, will give the Public more Leizure to read Books, &amp; cultivate Literature. I am with great Sincerity Dr Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh.</span></span> <span class="date">18 Dec<sup>r</sup>. 1759</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p>I desire the Favour of you to convey the enclosd to Dr Franklyn.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010316a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p></div></div>
