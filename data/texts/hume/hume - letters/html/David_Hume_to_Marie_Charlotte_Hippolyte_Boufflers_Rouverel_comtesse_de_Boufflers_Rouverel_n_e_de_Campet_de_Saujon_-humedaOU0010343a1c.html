	<div id="humedaOU0010343a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">15 May, 1761.</span></p><p class="salutation">Madam,</p><p><span class="linefirst">It is not easy for your Ladyship to imagine the pleasure I received from the letter, with which you have so unexpectedly honoured me,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010343a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> nor the agreeable visions of vanity, upon which, upon that occasion, I indulged myself.</span> I concluded, and, as I fancied, with certainty, that a person, who could write so well herself, must certainly be a good judge of writing in others; and that an author, who could please a lady of your distinction, educated in the Court of France, and familiarized with every thing elegant and polite, might reasonably pretend to some degree of merit, and might presume to take his rank above the middling historians. But, Madam, it is but fair, that I, who have pretended, in so long a work, to do justice to all parties and persons, should also do some to myself; and should not feed my vanity with chimeras, which, I am sensible in my cooler moments, can have no foundation in reason. When I had the pleasure of passing some time in France, I had the agreeable experience of the polite hospitality, by which your nation is distinguished; and I now find, that the same favourable indulgence has appeared in your Ladyship's judgement of my writings. And, perhaps, your esteem for the entire impartiality which I aim at, and which, to tell the truth, is so unusual in English historians, has made your Ladyship overlook many defects, into which the want of art or genius has betrayed me.</p><p>In this particular, Madam, I must own, that I am inclined to take your civilities in their full latitude, and to hope that I have not fallen much short of my intentions. The spirit of faction, which prevails in this country, and which is a natural attendant on civil liberty, carries every thing to extremes on the one side, as well as on the other; and I have the satisfaction to find, that my performance has alternately given displeasure to both parties. I could not reasonably hope to please both: such success is impossible from the nature of things; and next to your Ladyship's approbation, who, as a foreigner, must necessarily be a candid judge, I shall always regard the anger of both as the surest warrant of my impartiality.</p><p>As I find that you are pleased to employ your leisure hours in the perusal of history, I shall presume to recommend to your Ladyship a late work of this kind, wrote by my friend and countryman, Dr Robertson, which has met with the highest approbation from all good judges.</p><p>It is the History of Scotland during the age of the unfortunate Queen Mary; and it is wrote in an elegant, agreeable, and interesting manner, and far exceeding, I shall venture to say, any performance of that kind that has appeared in English. The failings of that Princess are not covered over; but her singular catastrophe is rendered truly lamentable and tragical; and the reader cannot forbear shedding tears for her fate, at the same time that he blames her conduct. There are few historical productions, where both the subject and execution have appeared so happy.</p><p>Some prospect is now given us, that this miserable war between the two nations is drawing towards a period, and that the former intercourse between them will again be renewed.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010343a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> If this happy event take place, I have entertained hopes that my affairs will permit me to take a journey to Paris; and the obliging offer, which you are pleased to make me, of allowing me to pay my respects to you, will prove a new and very powerful inducement to make me hasten the execution of my purpose.</p><p>But I give your Ladyship warning, that I shall, on many accounts, stand in need of your indulgence. I passed a few years in France during my early youth; but I lived in a provincial town, where I enjoyed the advantages of leisure for study, and an opportunity of learning the language: what I had imperfectly learned, long disuse, I am afraid, has made me forget: I have rusted amid books and study; have been little engaged in the active, and not much in the pleasurable scenes of life; and am more accustomed to a select society than to general companies.</p><p><span class="linelast">But all these disadvantages, and much greater, will be abundantly compensated by the honour of your Ladyship's protection; and I hope that my profound sense of your obliging favours will render me not altogether unworthy of it.</span></p><p class="signoff">I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, Madam, <br />Your Ladyship's most obedient, and most humble Servant, <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
