Produce, I call upon you, and have a right so to do, one single instance to support the heavy charge you bring against us; concealing from you, at the desire of the late Mr. Millar, the number of the 8vo edition of your History alone excepted; which we did purely at his request, having then no interest, nor the least shadow of interest, to deceive you in that or any other particular.</p><p>I own that I am quite astonished at the style of your last letter, which is such as should be directed to one of the most worthless of the human race, and to such only.</p><p>Do not imagine, however, that I mean to enter into a laboured defence of myself. Far from it. I have nothing to apologize for; nothing have I said or done respecting you, that I now wish unsaid or undone. — Some recent cause of disgust, however groundless, you have conceived; but as my whole conduct respecting you has all along be[en] so more than blameless, this cause, whatever it may be, is to me a perfect mystery. — I told you faithfully, from time to time, how many were left on hand of the 8vo edition. You told me in a later letter <em>that we had better submit to some loss, than allow the book to be discredited by that abominable edition</em>. — All proper haste was made to finish and publish it. In my last I told you not above 100 Copies were left; this was so very true, that upon enquiry today, I find they are exactly 76, which we can either destroy, or sell abroad; they are no object. But why do I trouble either you or myself to give you any detail upon this or any other subject; which, as you very politely tell me, <em>is entirely vain and fruitless, as you can give no manner of credit to my answers</em>.</p><p>Had not Mr. Cadell and I, from the moment we were free agents and concerned in your works, done everything we could devise for your satisfaction and honour; had we not invariably refused to have any interest in any thing that had a tendency to discredit or displease you; in particular Dr. Beattie's book; had we not on many occasions — But I scorn to instance more particulars — we might have looked for this treatment from you, from which the most blameless conduct on our part has not been able to defend us.</p><p>True it is (and this does not depend on my veracity else I would not have mentioned it) that I have said and done every thing in my power to persuade (or, if you please, to <em>seduce</em>) you to continue your History, from a full conviction, as you express it in your last, <em>that it would have been for your own advantage in more respects than one</em>. Your answer was constantly in the negative; of late, <em>that such an absurd and extravagant idea never entered your head</em>; and <em>that you had thrown your pen aside for ever</em>. — Whether I did well in thus repeatedly obtruding my advice upon you, and you in as repeatedly rejecting it, time only can discover. I know I meant well; that to me is great cause of satisfaction. — And now I cease to trouble you on this head for ever.</p><p>I had forgot that you desired 12 copies of this edition. They shall be directly sent you; and as many more as you shall hereafter desire are at your service. Your request respecting future editions of your Works shall be duly attended to. I shall only add, that at no period of my life could I have patiently borne the unmerited treatment you have given me; you will not therefore wonder, that having now, by my own industry, attained to a state of independence, and I will venture to say by a conduct unimpeachable, it should not sit very easy upon my stomach.</p><p>Some time or other you will perhaps discover with certainty, whether I am or not</p><p>Your faithful and Obedt Servt</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">W.
