I think there is all the Probability that this will prove a quiet Session;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010492a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> and there is a general Tranquillity established in Europe; so that we have nothing to do but cultivate Letters: There appears here a much greater Zeal of that kind than in England; but the best &amp; most taking works of the French are generally published in Geneva or Holland, and are in London before they are in Paris: So that I cannot have an Opportunity of serving you in the way I coud wish. I am sorry, that the last Publication has not been successful.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010492a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> I only saw the Beginning and judged from the Authors Character. The Beginning is much the best of the Work. I have not lost view of continuing my History. But as to the Point of my rising in Reputation, I doubt much of it: The mad and wicked Rage against the Scots, I am told, continues and encreases, and the English are such a mobbish People as never to distinguish. Happily their Opinion gives me no great Concern. I see in your Chronicle an Abridgement of a Treatise on the Constitution;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010492a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> which Treatise seems to be nothing but an Abridgement of my History; yet I shall engage, that the Author has not nam'd me from the beginning to the end of his Performance. On the whole, I can have no Motive of Ambition or Love of Fame to continue my History: Money in my present Circumstances is no Temptation: If I execute that Work, as is probable, it must be for Amusement to myself, after I am tir'd of Idleness. My Health and Spirits are as good at present as when I was five and twenty. Believe me Dear Sir with great Sincerity</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>My Compliments to Dr Franklin.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010492a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p></div></div>
