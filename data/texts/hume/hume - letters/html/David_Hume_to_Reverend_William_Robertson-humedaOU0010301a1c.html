	<div id="humedaOU0010301a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">12 March, 1759.</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I believe I mentioned to you a French gentleman, Monsieur Helvétius, whose book, <em>De l'Esprit</em>, was making a great noise in Europe.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> He is a very fine genius, and has the character of a very worthy man. My name is mentioned several times in his work with marks of esteem; and he has made me an offer, if I would translate his work into English, to translate anew all my philosophical writings into French.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> He says that none of them are well done, except that on the Natural History of Religion, by Monsieur Matigny,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> a Counsellor of State. He added, that the Abbé Prévost,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> celebrated for the <em>Mémoires d'un homme d'honneur</em>, and other entertaining books, was just now translating my History.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> This account of Helvétius engaged me to send him over the new editions of all my writings; and I have added your History, which, I told him, was here published with great applause; adding, that the subject was interesting and the execution masterly; and that it was probable some man of letters at Paris may think that a translation of it would be agreeable to the public. I thought that this was the best method of executing your intentions. I could not expect that any Frenchman here would be equal to the work. There is one Carracioli,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> who came to me and spoke of translating my new volume of history; but as he also mentioned his intentions of translating Smollett, I gave him no encouragement to proceed. The same reason would make me averse to see you in his hands.</p><p>But tho I have given this character of your work to Monsieur Helvétius, I warn you, that this is the last time, that, either to Frenchman or Englishman, I shall ever speak the least good of it. A plague take you! Here I sat near the historical summit of Parnassus, immediately under Dr Smollett; and you have the impudence to squeeze yourself by me, and place yourself directly under his feet. Do you imagine that this can be agreeable to me? And must not I be guilty of great simplicity to contribute by my endeavours to your thrusting me out of my place in Paris as well as at London? But I give you warning that you will find the matter somewhat difficult, at least in the former city. A friend of mine,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> who is there, writes home to his father, the strangest accounts on that head; which my modesty will not permit me to repeat, but which it allowed me very deliciously to swallow.</p><p>I have got a good reason or pretence for excusing me to Monsieur Helvétius with regard to the translating his work. <span class="linelast">A translation of it was previously advertised here.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010301a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span></span></p></div>
