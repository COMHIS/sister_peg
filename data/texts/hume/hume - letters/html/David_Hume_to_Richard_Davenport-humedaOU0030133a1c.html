So singular and odd he is in all his caprices. But we must allow him to have his own way; and as he has never spoke of the matter to you, it will be impossible for you to enter into it.</p><p>I send you enclosed a letter wrote to me by Monsieur Peyrou, his great friend at Neufchatel, who seems to me a man of merit.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030133a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> You will see by it that M. Rousseau is entirely satisfied with the reception you have given him.</p><p>I shall not fail to profit of the kind invitation which you are pleased to give me.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Sir, <br />Your most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S. I have wrote to M. Rousseau this post under the same cover with yours.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030133a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p></div></div>
