	<div id="humedaOU0020130a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">19 March, 1767.</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">You do extremely right in applying to me wherever it is the least likely I can serve you or any of your friends.</span> I consulted immediately with General Conway, who told me, as I suspected, that the chaplains to forts and garrisons were appointed by the War Office, and did not belong to his department. Unhappily I have but a slight acquaintance with Lord Barrington,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020130a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and cannot venture to ask him any favour; but I shall call on Pryce Campbell,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020130a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> tho not of my acquaintance, and shall enquire of him the canals through which this affair may be conducted: perhaps it may lie in my power to facilitate it by some means or other.</p><p>I shall endeavour to find out the unhappy philosopher you mention,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020130a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> tho it will be difficult for me to do him any service. He is an ingenious man, but unfortunate in his conduct, particularly in the early part of his life. The world is so cruel as never to overlook these flaws; and nothing but hypocrisy can fully cover them from observation. There is not so effectual a scourer of reputations in the world. I wish that I had never parted with that <em>Lixivium</em>, in case I should at any future time have occasion for it . . . .</p><p>A few days before my arrival in London, Mr Davenport had carried to Mr Conway a letter of Rousseau's, in which that philosopher says, that he had never meant to refuse the King's bounty, that he would be proud of accepting it, but that he would owe it entirely to His Majesty's generosity and that of his ministers, and would refuse it if it came through any other canal whatsoever, even that of Mr Davenport.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020130a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Mr Davenport then addressed himself to Mr Conway, and asked whether it was not possible to recover what this man's madness had thrown away? The Secretary replied, that I should be in London in a few days, and that he would take no steps in the affair but at my desire and with my approbation. When the matter was proposed to me, I exhorted the General to do this act of charity to a man of genius, however wild and extravagant. The King, when applied to, said, that since the pension had once been promised, it should be granted, notwithstanding all that had passed in the interval. And thus the affair is happily finished, unless some new extravagance come across the philosopher, and engage him to reject what he has anew applied for. If he knew my situation with General Conway he probably would; for he must then conjecture that the affair could not be done without my consent.</p><p>Ferguson's book goes on here with great success. A few days ago I saw Mrs Montague, who had just finished it with great pleasure: I mean, she was sorry to finish it, but had read it with great pleasure. I asked her, whether she was satisfied with the style? Whether it did not savour somewhat of the country? Oh yes, said she, a great deal: it seems almost impossible that anyone could write such a style except a Scotsman.</p><p>I find you prognosticate a very short date to my administration; I really believe that few (but not evil) will be my days. My absence will not probably allow my claret time to ripen, much less to sour. However that may be, I hope to drink out the remainder of it with you in mirth and jollity.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, <br />Sincerely yours, usque ad aras,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
