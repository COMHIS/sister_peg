	<div id="humedaOU0010036a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">You will find, that the Good-Nature &amp; friendly Disposition, which I have experienc'd in you, is like to occasion you more Trouble; &amp; tis very happy, that the same Good-Nature, which occasions the Trouble, will incline you to excuse it.</span></p><p>Since I saw you, I have been very busy in correcting &amp; finishing that Discourse concerning Morals, which you perus'd; &amp; I flatter myself, that the Alterations I have made have improv'd it very much both in point of Prudence &amp; Philosophy. I shall set out for London in three Weeks or a Month with an Intention of publishing it. The Bookseller, who printed the first two Volumes,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010036a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> is very willing to engage for this; &amp; he tells me that the Sale of the first Volumes, tho' not very quick, yet it improves. I have no Acquaintaince among these Folks, &amp; very little Skill in making Bargains. There are two Favours, therefore, I must ask of you, viz to tell me what Copy-Money<span href="/item/humedaOU0010036a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I may reasonably expect for one Edition of a thousand of this Volume, which will make a four Shillings Book; And, if you know any honest Man in this Trade, to send me a Letter of Recommendation to him that I may have the Choice of more than one Man to bargain with. Tis with Reluctance I ask this last Favour; tho' I know your Authority will go a great Way to make the Matter easy for me. I am sensible, that the point is a little delicate. Perhaps you may not care to recommend even to a Bookseller a Book that may give Offence to religious People: Perhaps you may not think it calculated for public Sale. I assure you, therefore, that I shall not take in the least amiss, if you refuse me. I shall only say with regard to the first Article, that the Book is pretty much alter'd since you saw it; &amp; tho' the Clergy be always Enemys to Innovations in Philosophy, yet I do not think they will find any great Matter of Offence in this Volume. On the contrary I shall be disappointed, if Impartial Judges be not much pleas'd with the Soundness of my Morals. I have sent you the <em>Conclusion</em>, as I have alter'd it, that you may see I desire to keep on good Terms even with the strictest &amp; most rigid. You need not return this Copy, unless you point out any Passage, which you think it proper for me to alter.</p><p>My Bookseller has sent to Mr Smith<span href="/item/humedaOU0010036a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> a Copy of my Book, which I hope he has receiv'd, as well as your Letter. I have not yet heard what he has done with the Abstract.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010036a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Perhaps you have. I have got it printed in London; but not in <em>the Works of</em> <em>the Learned</em>;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010036a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> there having been an Article with regard to my Book, somewhat abusive, printed in that Work, before I sent up the Abstract. I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant.</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Ninewells near Berwick.</span> <span class="date">March 4. 1740.</span></p></div>
