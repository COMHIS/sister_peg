	<div id="rousjeVF0310191a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">Nov. 21. 1766</span></p><p class="salutation">S<sup>r</sup></p><p>I rec'd yours of the 4th instant<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, by the last post, you say you have not seen the book<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, &amp; as you perhaps may be the last to see it, I send you a copy of a few lines from the 'Avertissement des Editeurs. M<sup>r</sup> H. en Livrant au public les pieces de son procès, nous a autorisés à déclarer qu'il ne reprendra jamais la plume sur ce sujet'. — Affairs here are now come to a Crisis &amp; I am almost certain no one can attend at present to any thing, every one's thoughts being employed about what will be their fate, a few day's will probably determine it<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>. God alone know's how it will end. I find all approve of your resolution not to publish more about this Worthless Man — all these reasons made me think it best not to obey you. But as I durst not Act upon my own judgment, I sounded the person whom you mention in your Letter. I said, I wondered whether you could resist publishing more about R., that now you had begun you would grow warmer, &amp; perhaps he would provoke you to it. He replied, there is no reason to think it. M<sup>r</sup> H: is a very peaceable man, besides what good could it do! R: ['s] own letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> without more, shows what he is, but he certainly won't for he says so. Upon this I was in no further doubt about what was fit for me to do, I quietly locked up your letter without saying a word of it to any mortal, and think it shall till further orders from You.</p><p>By all that I can learn, even his friends say nothing for him, nor nothing against you: &amp; his Enemies, &amp; the impartial approve of your conduct, &amp; all<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> give due praise to your humanity &amp; good Heart. What more can you desire! There is one paragraph in the Letter you sent me that if you will print it, I imagine it will come in much more àpropos in the preface to your Ecclesiastical History. You should have learnt this last Maxim in your Embassy<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. 'You are sure of your Friends so don't mind them, but secure your Enemies'. The latter part I would have you practise, leave the other for R. I am very glad he made you his Father Confessor, you know him so well that you Certainly can't beleive a word he say's. By your action's I should sooner suspect you. Strike a bold stroke, own you have been in the wrong, &amp; prove it both by word &amp; deed; I beleive you would give your ears to do it but you have not Courage. I suppose you have seen<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> the letter from your other Worthy Correspondent. All think it makes a poor figure by yours &amp; R: I was much diverted with these words 'Mais ou, Grand Dieu! ce bon homme emprunte-t'il les yeux dont il fixe ses Amis'<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, I thought I saw you in one of your brown studies at the fireside. What he says of my much valued friend the Jongleur<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> will do him no harm, he is as indifferent about all he can say as you can be; indeed all honest men are so, nay I think it is to any one's credit to say he has quarreled with them, a sure sign that he has obligations to them. If there is a Hell, that man will fry; bad as you are, I think you' ll not go to the same place. You'll say I am very free spoken, It is a failing from which you yourself are not entirely Exempt so you ought the readier to pardon it. Adieu. Famous as you are, both your names are but Common, <span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> where you now are<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310191a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> which makes me direct this as I do, as the safest way of sending it, I should not wish it to fall into other hands.</p></div>
