	<div id="humedaOU0030069a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">In this new Edition,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I have corrected several Mistakes &amp; Oversights, which had chiefly proceeded from the plaguy Prejudices of Whiggism, with which I was too much infected when I began this Work.</span> I corrected some of these Mistakes in a former Edition;<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> but being resolv'd to add to this Edition the Quotations &amp; Authorities for the Reigns of James I &amp; Charles I, I was oblig'd to run over again the most considerable Authors who had treated of these Reigns, and I happily discover'd some more Mistakes, which I have now corrected. As I began the History with these two Reigns, I now find that they, above all the rest, have been corrupted with Whig Rancour, and that I really deserv'd the Name of a party Writer, and boasted without any Foundation of my Impartiality: But if you now do me the Honour to give this part of my Work a second Perusal, I am perswaded, that you will no longer throw upon me this reproachful Epithet, and will acquit me of all Propensity to Whiggism. If you still continue to upbraid me, I shall be oblig'd to retaliate on you, and cry, <em>Whig vous-même</em>.</p><p><span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> In page 33, vol 5 you will find a full Justification of the Impositions laid on by James I, without Authority of Parliament; on p. 113, 114, 389, a justification of persecuting the Puritans; in p. 180 a justification of Charles I for levying Tonnage &amp; Poundage with consent of parliament: In p. 100 I acquit James I of prevarication with which I had before rashly charged him. This last mistake, indeed was innocent, and I can easily account for it; I had read Buckingham's Narrative in Rushworth &amp; Franklyn, the two opposite Collectors. I saw what I thought the same paper in the parliamentary History but I did not attend to a line at the bottom, in which it is said that the paper is taken from the Records more full than in the preceding Collection. When I read it lately, I found the Article here quoted. So that this blunder proceeded not from any Spirit of Whiggery.</p><p>I now justify James II more explicitly in his Exercise of the dispensing Power, which was intimately interwove with the Constitution &amp; Monarchy — see vol 6 p. 393, 394, 395, 400. In Volume 4 p. 322, 323, I mention a very remarkable Piece of Tyranny or of Exertion of arbitrary Power practised in that Period, and which came to my Knowledge since the first publication of that Volume.</p><p>There are many other Improvements &amp; Alterations throughout the whole; and I am glad, that Millar has of himself made you an Offer of this Edition. Without flattering you, I must say, that there is no body, whom I more desire to see my Writings as correct as I can make them; and I was thinking to desire Mr Millar to make you this Offer.</p><p>But there is no End of correcting. In this new Edition, vol. 5 p. 205, I have inserted a pretty curious Story of Sir George Markham, which I took from Lord Landesdowne,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> whom I esteem'd a safe Authority for a Whig Story. But I have since been shown Hobard's Reports,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> which is infinitely more authentic than Lord Landesdowne, and the Story is there told so as entirely to justify the King &amp; the Star Chamber. So that you may still reproach me, that the villainous Leaven is not entirely purg'd off.</p><p>I am engag'd in no work at present: But if I tire of Idleness, or more properly speaking, of reading for Amusement, I may probably continue my History. My only Discouragement is, that I cannot hope to finish this Work in my Closet, but must apply to the Great for Papers &amp; Intelligence; a thing I mortally abhor.</p><p>Is it not hard &amp; tyrannical in you, more tyrannical than any Act of the Stuarts, not to allow me to publish my Dialogues?<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Pray, do you not think that a proper Dedication may atone for what is exceptional in them? I am become much of my friend, Corbyn Morrice's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> Mind, who says, that he writes all his Books for the sake of the Dedications.</p><p>I am very glad to hear from Lord Minto,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> that you intend to pass a great Part of the ensuing Summer in this Country. Tho' you be now become a great Man,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030069a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> I doubt not but I shoud receive very much Satisfaction from your Society &amp; Conversation: That is, if I be not justled out by Suitors who will press in upon you.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Meanwhile I am Dear Sir <br />Your affectionate Friend &amp; Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">12 March 1763</span></p></div>
