	<div id="humedaOU0010261a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I can easily perceive that your Friends were no Lawyers, who said that there was no Statute in Henry the VII's Reign, which facilitated the Alienation of Lands, &amp; broke the antient Entails.</span> It is 4 H. VII cap. 24; but a man may read that Passage fifty times, and not find any thing that seems, in the least, to point that way. I shou'd certainly have overlook'd the Meaning of it, had I not been guided by Lord Kames. You must know that it was a Practice in the Courts of Justice, before Henry the Seventh's time, to break Entails by a Device which seems very ridiculous, but which is continu'd to this day, and first receiv'd the Sanction of Law during the Reign of that Prince. You have an entail'd Estate, I suppose, &amp; want to break the Entail: You agree with me that I am to claim the Estate by a sham Title, prior to the first entailer: You confess in Court that my Title is good &amp; valid: The Judges, upon this Confession of the Party, adjudge the Estate to me: Upon which I immediately restore the Estate to you, free &amp; unencumber'd; &amp; by this Hocus-Pocus the Entail is broke. Such was the Practice, pretty common before Henry the Seventh: All that the Parliament then did, was to regulate the Method of Proceeding in this fine Device, &amp; to determine that the Titles of Minors, &amp; femmes couvertes, were not to be injur'd by it. As to other People, who had an Interest to preserve an Entail, &amp; who had any good Reason to plead in their own Favor, they woud naturally appear for themselves. This Practice is calld a fine, &amp; a Recovery. Fine, from the Latin word <em>finis</em>; because it forecloses all Parties, &amp; puts a final Issue to their Claims &amp; Pretensions: A Recovery, because a Man thereby recovers his Estate, without the Encumbrance of an Entail.</p><p>By the bye, I am told, that there are many of these Practices still continu'd in the Law of England; which are as foolish, juvenile, &amp; ridiculous, as are to be met with in — I mean in — I woud be understood to mean in — any Craft or Profession of the World.</p><p>I am writing the History of England, from the Accession of Henry the 7<sup>th</sup>, &amp; am some Years advanc'd in Henry the 8<sup>th</sup>. I undertook this Work because I was tir'd of Idleness, &amp; found reading alone, after I had often perus'd all good Books, (which I think is soon done) somewhat a languid Occupation. As to the Approbation or Esteem of those Blockheads who call themselves the Public, &amp; whom a Bookseller, a Lord, a Priest, or a Party can guide, I do most heartily despise it. I shall be able, I think, to make a tolerable smooth, well told Tale of the History of England during that period; but I own I have not yet been able to throw much new Light into it. I begin the Reformation to morrow.</p><p>I find the Public, with you, have rejected the Epigoniad, for the present. They may do so if they please: But it has a great deal of Merit, much more than any one of them is capable of throwing into a Work.</p><p>I disapprove very much of Ferguson's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010261a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> Scruples, with regard to entering into Lord Bute's Family, with the Inspection of more than one Boy: But I hope Lord Bute will conform himself to his Delicacy, at least if he wants to have a Man of Sense, Knowlege, Taste, Elegance, &amp; Morals, for a Tutor to his Son.</p><p>I am much oblig'd to you for your good Intentions, with regard to my Cousin;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010261a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> but you must express yourself otherwise, than by saying that you will concur with the rest of my Friends in endeavouring to promote him.</p><p>For now that Oswald<span href="/item/humedaOU0010261a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is out of Court, whom have I besides to apply to? <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">9 Aug 1757</span></p></div>
