	<div id="humedaOU0010059a1c"><p class="salutation">My Dear Sir</p><p>I am inform'd, that such a popular Clamour has been raisd against me in Edinburgh, on account of Scepticism, Heterodoxy &amp; other hard Names, which confound the ignorant, that my Friends find some Difficulty, in working out the Point of my Professorship, which once appear'd so easy.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Did I need a Testimonial for my Orthodoxy I shoud certainly appeal to you. For you know that I always imitated Job's Friends, &amp; defended the Cause of Providence when [you]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> attackt it, on account of the Headachs you felt after a Deba[uch]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>. But as a more particular Explication of that particular seems superfluous I shall only apply to you, for a Renewal of your good Offices with your Nephew Lord Tinwal,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> whose Interest with Yetts<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp; Allan<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> may be of Service to me. There is no Time to lose; so that I must beg you to be speedy in writing to him or speaking to him on that head. A word to the Wise. Even that is not necessary to a Friend such as I have always esteemd &amp; found you to be.</p><p>I live here very comfortably with the Marquess of Annandale, who I suppose you have heard, sent me a Letter of Invitation, along with a Bill of 100£ about two Months ago.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Every thing is much better than I expected, from the Accounts I heard after I came to London. For the Secrecy, with which I stole away from Edin<sup>r</sup>, &amp; which I thought necessary for preserving my Interest there, kept me entirely ignorant of his Situation. My Lord never was in so good a Way [before].<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> He has a regular Family, honest Servants, &amp; every thing is [m]anag'd genteely &amp; with Oeconomy. He has entrusted all his English Affairs to a mighty honest friendly Man, Capt Vincent, who is Cousin Germain to the Marchioness. And as my Lord has now taken as strong a Turn to Solitude &amp; Repose as he formerly had to Company &amp; Agitation, tis to be hopd that his good Parts &amp; excellent Dispositions may at last being accompanyd with more Health &amp; Tranquillity, render him a Comfort to his Friends, if not an Ornament to his Countrey.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010059a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> As you live in the Neighbourhood of the Marchioness, it may give her a Pleasure to hear these particulars. I am Dear Sir</p><p>Your most affectionate humble Serv<sup>t</sup></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Welde-hall near St. Albans.</span> <br /><span class="date">Aprile. 25. 1745</span></p></div>
