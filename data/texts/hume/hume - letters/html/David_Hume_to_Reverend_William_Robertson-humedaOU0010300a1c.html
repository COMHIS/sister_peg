It was a leaf of your History, and the very character of Queen Elizabeth, which you had laboured so finely, little thinking it would so soon come to so disgraceful an end. I happened a little after to see Millar, and told him the story; consulting him, to be sure, on the fate of his new boasted historian, of whom he was so fond. But the story proves more serious than I apprehended. For he told Strahan, who thence suspects villany among his prentices and journeymen; and has sent me very earnestly to know the gentleman's name, that he may find out the grocer, and trace the matter to the bottom. In vain did I remonstrate that this was sooner or later the fate of all authors, <em>serius, ocyus, sors exitura</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010300a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> He will not be satisfied; and begs me to keep my jokes for another occasion. But that I am resolved not to do; and therefore, being repulsed by his passion and seriousness, I direct them against you.</p><p>Next week, I am published; and then, I expect a constant comparison will be made between Dr Robertson and Mr Hume. I shall tell you in a few weeks which of these heroes is likely to prevail. Meanwhile, I can inform both of them for their comforts, that their combat is not likely to make half so much noise as that between Broughton and the one-eyed coachman. <span href="/item/humedaOU0010300a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> <em>Vanitas vanitatum, atque omnia vanitas</em>.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I shall still except, however, the friendship and good opinion of worthy men.</span></p></div>
