	<div id="humedaOU0010032a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p>I am much oblig'd to you for your Reflections on my Papers.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I have perus'd them with Care, &amp; find they will be of use to me. You have mistaken my Meaning in some Passages; which upon Examination I have found to proceed from some Ambiguity or Defect in my Expression.</p><p>What affected me most in your Remarks is your observing, that there wants a certain Warmth in the Cause of Virtue, which, you think, all good Men wou'd relish, &amp; cou'd not displease amidst abstract Enquirys.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> I must own, this has not happen'd by Chance, but is the Effect of a Reasoning either good or bad. There are different ways of examining the Mind as well as the Body. One may consider it either as an Anatomist or as a Painter; either to discover its most secret Springs &amp; Principles or to describe the Grace &amp; Beauty of its Actions. I imagine it impossible to conjoin these two Views. Where you pull off the Skin, &amp; display all the minute Parts, there appears something trivial, even in the noblest Attitudes &amp; most vigorous Actions: Nor can you ever render the Object graceful or engaging but by cloathing the Parts again with Skin &amp; Flesh, &amp; presenting only their bare Outside. An Anatomist, however, can give very good Advice to a Painter or Statuary: And in like manner, I am perswaded, that a Metaphysician may be very helpful to a Moralist; tho' I cannot easily conceive these two Characters united in the same Work. Any warm Sentiment of Morals, I am afraid, wou'd have the Air of Declamation amidst abstract Reasonings, &amp; wou'd be esteem'd contrary to good Taste. And tho' I am much more ambitious of being esteem'd a Friend to Virtue, than a Writer of Taste; yet I must always carry the latter in my Eye, otherwise I must despair of ever being servicable to Virtue. I hope these Reasons will satisfy you; tho at the same time, I intend to make a new Tryal, if it be possible to make the Moralist &amp; Metaphysician agree a little better.</p><p>I cannot agree to your Sense of <em>Natural</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Tis founded on final Causes; which is a Consideration, that appears to me pretty uncertain &amp; unphilosophical. For pray, what is the End of Man? Is he created for Happiness or for Virtue? For this Life or for the next? For himself or for his Maker? Your Definition of <em>Natural</em> depends upon solving these Questions, which are endless, &amp; quite wide of my Purpose. I have never call'd Justice unnatural, but only artificial. <em>Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater &amp; aequi</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Says one of the best Moralists of Antiquity. <em>Grotius</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp; <em>Puffendorf</em>,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> to be consistent, must assert the same.</p><p>Whether natural Abilitys be Virtues is a Dispute of Words.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> I think I follow the common Use of Language. <em>Virtus</em> signify'd chiefly Courage among the <em>Romans</em>. I was just now reading this Character of Alexander the 6th in Guicciardin. <span lang="it">In Alessandro Sesto fu solertia &amp; sagacita singulare: consiglio eccellente, efficacia a persuadere maravigliosa, &amp; a tutte le facende gravi, sollicitudine &amp; destrezza incredible. Ma erano queste virtù avanzate di grande intervallo da vitii &amp;c.</span><span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> Were Benevolence the only Virtue no Characters cou'd be mixt, but wou'd depend entirely on their Degrees of Benevolence. Upon the whole, I desire to take my Catalogue of Virtues from <em>Cicero's Offices</em>, not from the <em>Whole Duty of Man</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> I had, indeed, the former Book in my Eye in all my Reasonings.</p><p>I have many other Reflections to communicate to you; but it wou'd be troublesome. I shall therefore conclude with telling you, that I intend to follow your Advice in altering most of those Passages you have remarkt as defective in Point of Prudence; tho' I must own, I think you a little too delicate. Except a Man be in Orders, or be immediatly concern'd in the Instruction of Youth, I do not think his Character depends upon his philosophical Speculations, as the World is now model'd; &amp; a little Liberty seems requisite to bring into the public Notice a Book that is calculated for so few Readers. I hope you will allow me the Freedom of consulting you when I am in any Difficulty; &amp; believe me to be</p><p class="signoff">Dear Sir <br />Your most oblig'd humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Ninewells near Berwick.</span> <br /> <span class="date">Septr. 17 1739.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p>I cannot forbear recommending another thing to your Consideration. Actions are not virtuous nor vicious; but only so far as they are proofs of certain Qualitys or durable Principles in the Mind. This is a Point I shou'd have establish'd more expressly than I have done.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> Now I desire you to consider, if there be any Quality, that is virtuous, without having a Tendency either to the public Good or to the Good of the Person, who possesses it. If there be none without these Tendencys, we may conclude, that their Merit is derivd from Sympathy. I desire you wou'd only consider the Tendencys of Qualitys, not their actual Operation, which depends on Chance. <em>Brutus</em> riveted the Chains of <em>Rome</em> faster by his Opposition; but the natural Tendency of his noble Dispositions, his public Spirit &amp; Magnanimity, was to establish her Liberty.</p><p>You are a great Admirer of <em>Cicero</em>, as well as I am. Please to review the 4th Book, <em>de finibus bonorum &amp; malorum</em>; where you find him prove against the <em>Stoics</em>, that if there be no other Goods but Virtue, tis impossible there can be any Virtue; because the Mind woud then want all Motives to begin its Actions upon: And tis on the Goodness or Badness of the Motives that the Virtue of the Action depends. This proves, that to every virtuous Action there must be a Motive or impelling Passion distinct from the Virtue, &amp; that Virtue can never be the sole Motive to any Action.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010032a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> You do not assent to this; tho' I think there is no Proposition more certain or important. I must own my Proofs were not distinct enough, &amp; must be alterd. You see with what Reluctance I part with you; tho' I believe it is time I shoud ask your Pardon for so much trouble</p></div></div>
