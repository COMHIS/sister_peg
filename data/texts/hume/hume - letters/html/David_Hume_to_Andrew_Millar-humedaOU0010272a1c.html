	<div id="humedaOU0010272a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am very glad that Mr Robertson is entering on Terms with you.</span> It was indeed my Advice to him, when he set out for London, that he shoud think of no other Body; and I ventur'd to assure him, that he woud find your way of dealing frank &amp; open &amp; generous. He read me part of his History, and I had an Opportunity of reading another Part of it in Manuscript above a twelvemonth ago. Upon the whole, my Expectations, both from what I saw, &amp; from my Knowledge of the Author, were very much rais'd; and I consider it as a Work of uncommon Merit. I know that he has employ'd himself with great Diligence &amp; Care in collecting the Facts: His style is lively &amp; entertaining: And he judges with Temper and Candor. He is a man generally known &amp; esteemd in this Country; and we look upon him very deservedly as inferior to no body in Capacity &amp; Learning. Hamilton &amp; Balfour have offerd him a very unusual Price; no less than 500 Pounds for one Edition of 2000; but I own, that I shoud be better pleas'd to see him in your hands. I only inform you of this Fact, that you may see how high the general Expectations are of Mr Robertson's Performance. It will have a quick Sale in this Country from the Character of the Author; and in England from the Merit of the Work, as soon as it is known.</p><p>Some part of his Subject is common with mine; but as his Work is a History of Scotland, mine of England, we do not interfere; and it will rather be an Amusement to the Reader to compare our Method of treating the same Subject. I give you Thanks, however, for your Attention in asking my Opinion.</p><p>By hurrying myself, I coud with some Difficulty be ready at the time you desire: But it will be better both for me &amp; the Book that you do not publish, till after the Christmas Holydays. I am glad to hear, that you intend to be in this Country soon. We shall then have an Opportunity of speaking of that Matter.</p><p>You would oblige me much, if you woud prepare the way for an Acquaintaince between Dr Birch &amp; me, when I shall be in London. I have a great Esteem for his Character; have heard that he is very communicative; and is very willing, and even desirous, to give Information to any Body that applies to him. Such an Acquaintance woud be very useful and agreeable to me.</p><p>I sent Mr Elliots Letter the Instant I receivd it. Do you not intend to print a new Edition this Autumn of the other two Volumes?<span href="/item/humedaOU0010272a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I am afraid, this extraordinary Run upon Dr Smollet has a little hurt your Sales:<span href="/item/humedaOU0010272a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> But these things are only temporary.</p><p>I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinr</span></span> <span class="date">6 April 1758</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p>The Service I receivd from Mr Strahan made me recommend it to Mr Robertson, if he agreed with you, to desire that he might be the Printer, if it consisted with your Convenience.</p></div></div>
