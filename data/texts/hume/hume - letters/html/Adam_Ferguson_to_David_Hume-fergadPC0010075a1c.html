	<div id="fergadPC0010075a1c"><p class="folio">[folio 1 recto]</p><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">Aprile 17<sup>th</sup> <br />1767</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p>I promised to make all my applications to the Ministry by your means &amp; I hope that before all the affairs of this church &amp; State are settled you will think me a man of my word. I beg that if you are not disgraced and on your way to Scotland<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> before this comes to hand, which I hope you will be very soon, that you will favour the Prayer of the inclosed Petition<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> from My Colleagues. I am not concerned but their Petition is reasonable it is gone I believe to The treasury by some Proper conveyance &amp; I woud fain hope it may receive some Support from you likewise as being of the Northern Department.</p><p>I am glad to hear from J<sup>no</sup> Home that the last representation we made in his affair<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> may be Satisfactory. God grant your continuance in Power till this affair is dispatched. I am <span class="folio">[folio 1 verso]</span> much obliged to you for the Review<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and to the Author of it for his favour &amp; partiality to me. I have just now sent me by Lord Kames<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> who is at Blair Drummond<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> a Letter of M<sup>rs</sup> Montagu<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> to His Lordship. If I knew the ground on which she trod in this countrey<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> I woud kiss it for the Notice she is pleased to take <ins>of me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>. I am very sorry for the complaints of her health &amp; for her thinking that mankind in any state shoud be as perfect as her conceptions, in order to give Satisfaction. I dont believe that there is in the whole list of created beings one that acts his part or fulfills his destiny better than man, &amp; I am perfectly satisfied with him &amp; with no circumstance better than I am with his fancying a perfection superiour to his own Nature which is the foundation of many of his complaints<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>. I write all this in hopes that when you see M<sup>rs</sup> Montagu you will mix some of my Philosophy with your own. I am nevertheless somewhat Angry <span class="folio">[folio 2 recto]</span> with her for conjuring up the Spartan black broth against <ins>me</ins><span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> <span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>. I thought to have laid this Devil under the Genteeler appellation of Pottage which you know is here a dish in great request. I know that you are an admirer of the Athenians as well as M<sup>rs</sup> Montagu &amp; if I were to plead the cause of Sparta against her I must appeal somewhere else. Meantime I believe in my conscience that very few even of the Spartans coud receive her commendations without Vanity, and I am in this Article but a mere Scots Man.</p><p>John Home sets out for London next week. I expect to dine at the Poker with Edgar<span href="/item/fergadPC0010075a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span>, to day he goes there for the first time. All is well here &amp; what your malice wanted to represent as mischief done by me has turned out no mischief at all.</p><p class="signoff">I am D<sup>r</sup> S<sup>r</sup> <br />your most Affectionate <br />humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Adam Ferguson</span></p></div>
