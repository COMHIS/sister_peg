	<div id="humedaOU0010182a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">8<sup>th</sup> Dec. 1753.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am at present reduced to the utmost straits and difficulties.</span> I know people are commonly ashamed to own such distresses. But to whom can one have recourse in his misfortunes, but to his friends? and who can I account my friend, if not Dr Clephane? not a friend only in the sunshine of fortune, but also in the shade of adversity: not a security only in a calm; but in a storm a sheet-anchor <span lang="grc">ἄνχορη ἐσχάτη</span> . (This etymology of sheet-anchor, I remember you communicated to me on board the <em>Superbe</em>; and you see, by this instance, that your ingenious things have not been thrown away upon me.) But, to cut short all prefaces — though, commonly, beggars and authors abound with them, and I unite both these qualities — the occasion of my distress is as follows:</p><p>You know that the word <em>enough</em>, or <em>enuff</em>, as it is pronounced by the English, we commonly, in Scotland, when it is applied to number, pronounce <em>enow</em>. Thus we would say: 'such a one has books <em>enow</em> for study, but not leisure <em>enuff</em>.' Now I want to know, whether the English make the same distinction. I observed the distinction clearly in Lord Shaftesbury; 'Though there be doors enow,' says he, 'to get out of life;' and thinking that this distinction of spelling words, that had both different letters, and different pronunciation, was an improvement, I followed it in my learned productions, though I knew it was not usual. But there has lately arisen in me a doubt, that this is a mere Scotticism; and that the English always pronounce the word, as if it were wrote <em>enuff</em>, whether it be applied to numbers or to quantity. To you, therefore, I apply in this doubt and perplexity. Though I make no question that your ear is well purged from all native impurities, yet trust not entirely to it, but ask any of your English friends, that frequent good company, and let me know their opinion.</p><p>It is a rule of Vaugelas always to consult the ladies, rather than men, in all doubts of language; and he asserts, that they have a more delicate sense of the propriety of expressions. The same author advises us, if we desire any one's opinion in any grammatical difficulty, not to ask him directly; for that confounds his memory, and makes him forget the use, which is the true standard of language. The best way, says he, is to engage him as it were by accident, to employ the expression about which we are in doubt. <span class="linelast">Now, if you are provided of any expedient, for making the ladies pronounce the word <em>enough</em>, applied both to quantity and number, I beg you to employ it, and to observe carefully and attentively, whether they make any difference in the pronunciation.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>I am quite in earnest in desiring a solution of my grammatical doubt.</p></div></div>
