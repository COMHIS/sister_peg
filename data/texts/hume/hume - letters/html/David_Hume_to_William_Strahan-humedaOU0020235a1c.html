	<div id="humedaOU0020235a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">You will have a Copy of my philosophical Pieces corrected in a few weeks by a safe hand, who will deliver them to Miss Elliot.</span> She will inform you by a Penny post Letter of their Arrival. I have perusd them carefully five times over; yet the Corrections I make are not of Importance. Such is the Advantage of frequent Impressions!</p><p>It vexes me to the last Degree, that, by reason of this detested Edition of my History, I shoud have so distant or no prospect of ever giving a correct Edition of that Work. I assure you, if Mr Millar were now alive, I shoud be tempted to go over to Dublin, and to publish there an Edition, which I hope woud entirely discredit the present one.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> But as you are entirely innocent in the Conduct of this Affair, I scruple to take that Resolution. The worst of it is, that Affairs have been so manag'd as to leave me in entire Ignorance of the State of the Sale; tho‘ I am now confident, that, as you see evidently I am resolv'd never to engaged again with the public, you will no longer have any Scruple to tell me the whole Truth of the Matter.</p><p>But to leave this Subject, which is so very vexatious, and to talk of public affairs; I am much inclind to have the same good opinion of Lord North, which you express:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> His taking the Helm in such a Storm, and conducting it so prudently, prepossess one much in his favour: I am also assurd, that he was the last in the Ministry who woud give up the Resolution of punishing that insolent Fellow, Beckford, and the City of London. But to me, his Conduct of the Spanish Affair appears rash, insolent and unjust. The publication of the Spanish Papers confirms me farther in that Opinion. It appears, that the Spaniards had never abandond the Settlement, made by the French, which was prior to ours;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and consequently that their right was in every respect undisputable. And as the Court of Spain offerd from the first to disavow the Governor of Buenos Ayros,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> if we woud disavow Hunt,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> to run the Danger of a War which woud have thrown all Europe, and almost the whole Globe into a Ferment, must be regarded as an unpardonable Temerity. We were savd from that Disaster by nothing but the extreme Love of Tranquillity in the French King, an Incident which no Human Prudence coud forsee. But what must we think of the Effrontery of the Patriots, who rail at Lord North for Tameness and Pusillanimity? They did not probably know the secret, otherwise they woud have exclaimd with better Reason against his Rashness and Imprudence.</p><p>I wish I coud have the same Idea with you of the Prosperity of our public Affairs. But when I reflect, that, from 1740 to 1761, during the Course of no more than 21 Years, while a most pacific Monarch sat on the Throne of France, the Nation ran in Debt about a hundred Millions;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> that the wise and virtuous Minister, Pitt, could contract more Incumbrances, in six months of an unnecessary War, than we have been able to discharge during eight Years of Peace; and that we persevere in the same frantic Maxims; I can forsee nothing but certain and speedy Ruin either to the Nation or to the public Creditors. The last, tho‘ a great Calamity, woud be a small one in comparison; but I cannot see how it can be brought about, while these Creditors fill all the chief Offices and are the Men of greatest Authority in the Nation.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> In other Respects the Kingdom may be thriving: The Improvement of our Agriculture is a good Circumstance; tho‘ I believe our Manufactures do not advance; and all depends on our Union with America, which, in the Nature of things, cannot long subsist.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> But all this is nothing in comparison of the continual Encrease of our Debts, in every idle War, into which, it seems, the Mob of London are to rush every Minister. But these are all other Peoples Concerns; and I know not why I shoud trouble my head about them.</p><p>I maintaind and still maintain that Henry's History has merit; tho‘ I own'd and still own, that the Length of the Undertaking is a great Objection to its Success; perhaps an insuperable one. But what shall we say to Sir John Dalrymple's new History,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> of which, I see, you are one of the publishers? He has writ down that he has been offerd 2000 pounds for the Property of it: I hope you are not the Purchasers; tho‘ indeed I know not but you might be a Gainer by it: The ranting, bouncing Style of that Performance may perhaps take with the Multitude. This however I am certain of, that there is not one new Circumstance of the least Importance from the beginning to the End of the Work. But really I doubt much of his Veracity in his Account of the Offer: I shoud be much obligd to you for your Information on that head.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> Never let the Bargain made by Dr Robertson<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> be thought extravagant, if this be true. I shoud add a great Number of Cyphers to bring up the Knight's Performance to an equal Value with that of the Doctor.</p><p>I very much regret with you Sir Andrew Mitchels<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> Death: He was a worthy, well-bred, agreeable man. If the Prince, at whose Court he resided, us'd him ill of late Years,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> he richly deserves the Epithet you give him.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020235a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> Sir Andrew's chief Fault was his too great Attachment to that prince.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">11 of March 1771.</span></p></div>
