What a Prodigy are they, when considerd as the Production of a man, so cruelly dealt with, both by Nature [and]<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Fortune? When you add to this, that the Author is a Man of the best Dispositions, that I have ever known, and tho' of great Frugality, is plac'd in the most cruel Indigence, you will certainly think his Case more deserving of Pity &amp; Regard than any you have almost met with. Mr Foulis<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> has Copies to dispose of, which I have sent him; &amp; which he will disperse without expecting any Profit. I must entreat you, not only to take a Copy yourself, but also to take a few more &amp; [dis]pose<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> of among your Acquaintance.

That you may [rec]ommend<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> them with a safer Conscience, please read the Ode to a young Gentleman going to the Coast of Guinea, that on Refinements in metaphysical Philosophy, that to a Lady on the Death of her Son; the Wish, an Elegy; the Soliloquy. I am much mistaken, if you do not find all these [v]ery<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> laudable Performances; &amp; such as wou'd be esteem'd an Ornament to Dodesley's Miscellanies [o]r even to better Collections.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030035b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p><p>We expected to have seen you in Town about this time; but have been dissappointed.
