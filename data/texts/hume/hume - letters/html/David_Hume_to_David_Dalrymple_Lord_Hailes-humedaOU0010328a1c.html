	<div id="humedaOU0010328a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">August 16, 1760.</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am not surprised to find by your letter, that Mr Gray<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> should have entertained suspicions with regard to the authenticity of these fragments of our Highland poetry.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></span> The first time I was shown the copies of some of them in manuscript, by our friend John Home, I was inclined to be a little incredulous on that head; but Mr Home removed my scruples, by informing me of the manner in which he procured them from Mr Macpherson, the translator.</p><p>These two gentlemen were drinking the waters together at Moffat last autumn, when their conversation fell upon Highland poetry, which Mr Macpherson extolled very highly. Our friend, who knew him to be a good scholar, and a man of taste, found his curiosity excited, and asked whether he had ever translated any of them. Mr Macpherson replied, that he never had attempted any such thing; and doubted whether it was possible to transfuse such beauties into our language; but, for Mr Home's satisfaction, and in order to give him a general notion of the strain of that wild poetry, he would endeavour to turn one of them into English. He accordingly brought him one next day, which our friend was so much pleased with, that he never ceased soliciting Mr Macpherson, till he insensibly produced that small volume which has been published.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p>After this volume was in every body's hands, and universally admired, we heard every day new reasons, which put the authenticity, not the great antiquity which the translator ascribes to them, beyond all question; for their antiquity is a point, which must be ascertained by reasoning; though the arguments he employs seem very probable and convincing. But<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> certain it is, that these poems are in every body's mouth in the Highlands, have been handed down from father to son, and are of an age beyond all memory and tradition.</p><p>In the family of every Highland chieftain, there was anciently retained a bard, whose office was the same with that of the Greek rhapsodists; and the general subject of the poems which they recited was the wars of Fingal; an epoch no less celebrated among them, than the wars of Troy among the Greek poets. This custom is not even yet altogether abolished: the bard and piper are esteemed the most honourable offices in a chieftain's family, and these two characters are frequently united in the same person. Adam Smith, the celebrated professor in Glasgow, told me, that the piper of the Argyleshire Militia repeated to him all those poems which Mr Macpherson has translated, and many more of equal beauty. Major Mackay, Lord Rae's brother,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> also told me that he remembers them perfectly; as likewise did the Laird of Macfarlane,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> the greatest antiquarian whom we have in this country, and who insists so strongly on the historical truth, as well as on the poetical beauty of these productions. I could add the Laird<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> and Lady Macleod to these authorities, with many more, if these were not sufficient, as they live in different parts of the Highlands, very remote from each other, and they could only be acquainted with poems that had become in a manner national works, and had gradually spread themselves into every mouth, and been imprinted on every memory.</p><p>Every body in Edinburgh is so convinced of this truth, that we have endeavoured to put Mr Macpherson on a way of procuring us more of these wild flowers. He is a modest, sensible young man, not settled in any living, but employed as a private tutor in Mr Grahame of Balgowan's family,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> a way of life which he is not fond of. We have, therefore, set about a subscription of a guinea or two guineas apiece, in order to enable him to quit that family, and undertake a mission into the Highlands, where he hopes to recover more of these fragments. There is, in particular, a country surgeon somewhere in Lochaber, who, he says, can recite a great number of them, but never committed them to writing; as indeed the orthography of the Highland language is not fixed, and the natives have always employed more the sword than the pen. This surgeon has by heart the epic poem mentioned by Mr Macpherson in his preface; and as he is somewhat old, and is the only person living that has it entire, we are in the more haste to recover a monument, which will certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the Republic of Letters.</p><p>I own, that my first and chief objection to the authenticity of these fragments, was not on account of the noble and even tender strokes which they contain; for these are the offspring of genius and passion in all countries; I was only surprised at the regular plan which appears in some of these pieces, and which seems to be the work of a more cultivated age. None of the specimens of barbarous poetry known to us, the Hebrew, Arabian, or any other, contained this species of beauty; and if a regular epic poem, or even anything of that kind, nearly regular, should also come from that rough climate or uncivilized people, it would appear to me a phenomenon altogether unaccountable.</p><p>I remember Mr Macpherson told me, that the heroes of this Highland epic were not only, like Homer's heroes, their own butchers, bakers, and cooks, but also their own shoemakers, carpenters, and smiths. He mentioned an incident which put this matter in a remarkable light. A warrior has the head of his spear struck off in a battle; upon which he immediately retires behind the army, where a forge was erected; makes a new one; hurries back to the action; pierces his enemy, while the iron, which was yet red-hot, hisses in the wound. This imagery you will allow to be singular, and so well imagined, that it would have been adopted by Homer, had the manners of the Greeks allowed him to have employed it.</p><p>I forgot to mention, as another proof of the authenticity of these poems, and even of the reality of the adventures contained in them, that the names of the heroes, Fingal, Oscar, Osur, Oscan, Dermid, are still given in the Highlands to large mastiffs, in the same manner as we affix to them the names of Caesar, Pompey, Hector; or the French that of Marlborough.</p><p>It gives me pleasure to find, that a person of so fine a taste as Mr Gray approves of these fragments; as it may convince us, that our fondness of them is not altogether founded on national prepossessions, which, however, you know to be a little strong. The translation is elegant; but I made an objection to the author, which I wish you would communicate to Mr Gray, that we may judge of the justness of it. There appeared to me many verses in his prose, and all of them in the same measure with Mr Shenstone's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010328a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> famous ballad:</p><p>Ye shepherds so careless and free, <br />Whose flocks never carelessly roam, &amp;c.</p><p>Pray ask Mr Gray, whether he made the same remark, and whether he thinks it a blemish?</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours most sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
