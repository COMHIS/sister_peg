I am afraid these two Gentlemen woud think me somewhat forward in such an Application.</p><p>I have been very busy ever since I came down; and if I keep my Health, shall be able to publish Winter after the next, or at farthest in the subsequent Spring: Which I fancy will serve your Purpose well enough. At any Rate, this is not a Matter which I can hurry on, faster than I am able to satisfy myself in the Execution.</p><p>I am very much pleas'd with what you tell me, that the Clarendon Papers have fallen into Dr Douglas's Hands especially as Dr Robertson tells me he intends to publish them.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010331a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> What my Sentiments are on the Question you mention, you may learn from my Letter to the Doctor, which I have sent you open, &amp; which I beg you to take the Trouble of sending. For I do not know how to direct it.</p><p>I am glad to hear from all Accounts that Mrs Millar is in so good or so tolerable a State of Health: Most of our Friends, I own, say a <em>good State of Health</em>: But we shall make use of whatever Term she pleases; provided she eat &amp; sleep well &amp; maintain her sociable Humour, and only complain a little in the Intervals.
