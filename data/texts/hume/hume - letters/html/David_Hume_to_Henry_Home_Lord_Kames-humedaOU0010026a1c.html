	<div id="humedaOU0010026a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">Feb. 13, 1739.</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I thought to have wrote this from a place nearer you than London, but have been detained here by contrary winds, which have kept all Berwick ships from sailing.</span> 'Tis now a fortnight since my book<span href="/item/humedaOU0010026a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> was published; and besides many other considerations, I thought it would contribute very much to my tranquillity, and might spare me many mortifications, to be in the country, while the success of the work was doubtful. I am afraid 'twill remain so very long. Those who are accustomed to reflect on such abstract subjects, are commonly full of prejudices; and those who are unprejudiced are unacquainted with metaphysical reasonings. My principles are also so remote from all the vulgar sentiments on the subject, that were they to take place, they would produce almost a total alteration in philosophy: and you know, revolutions of this kind are not easily brought about. I am young enough to see what will become of the matter; but am apprehensive lest the chief reward I shall have for some time will be the pleasure of studying on such important subjects, and the approbation of a few judges. Among the rest, you may believe I aspire to your approbation; and next to that, to your free censure and criticism. I shall present you with a copy as soon as I come to Scotland; and hope your curiosity, as well as friendship, will make you take the pains of perusing it.</p><p>If you know any body that is a judge, you would do me a sensible pleasure in engaging him to a serious perusal of the book. 'Tis so rare to meet with one that will take pains on a book, that does not come recommended by some great name or authority, that I must confess, I am as fond of meeting with such a one, as if I were sure of his approbation. I am, however, so doubtful in that particular, that I have endeavoured all I could to conceal my name; though I believe I have not been so cautious in this respect as I ought to have been.</p><p>I have sent the Bishop of Bristol<span href="/item/humedaOU0010026a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> a copy; but could not wait on him with your letter after he had arrived at that dignity: At least I thought it would be to no purpose after I begun the printing. You'll excuse the frailty of an author in writing so long a letter about nothing but his own performances. Authors have this privilege in common with lovers, and founded on the same reason, that they are both besotted with a blind fondness of their object. I have been upon my guard against this frailty; but perhaps this has rather turned to my prejudice: The reflection on our caution is apt to give us a more implicit confidence afterwards, when we come to form a judgment. <span class="linelast">I am, Dear Sir, Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p></div>
