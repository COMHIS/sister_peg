	<div id="humedaOU0020026b1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Brother.</p><p><span class="linefirst">I do not think it likely, that you and Mr Robertson<span href="/item/humedaOU0020026b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> will agree about the Price after differing so widely.</span> I remember the Place you mention, which did not appear very fertile; but I know that Improvements succeed best on such light Soils. I should be pleas'd that at your Leizure you made Enquiry about the Price; and as I know you to be cautious, I shall be directed by you in the Offer. Mean-while Davie Anderson may be seeking out a hand for my Money.</p><p>As most of my Money is now getting into heritable Security, I must alter the Mode of my Settlement. Be so good, therefore, as to send me my Will and Testament, which I left with you.</p><p>Rousseau left me four days ago. He goes to live in a House of Mr Davenport, a worthy Gentleman of 5 or 6000 pounds a year, who gives him one of his houses in Derbyshire, in which he himself seldom lives, and takes 30 pounds a Year of board for him and his Gouvernante. Surely Rousseau is one of the most singular of all human Beings, and one of the most unhappy. His extreme Sensibility of Temper is his Torment; as he is much more susceptible of Pain than Pleasure. His Aversion to Society is not Affectation as is commonly believd: When in it, he is commonly very amiable, but often very unhappy. And tho' he be also unhappy in Solitude, he prefers that Species of suffering to the other. He is surely a very fine Genius: And of all the Writers that are or ever were in Europe, he is the man who has acquird the most enthusiastic and most passionate Admirers. I have seen many extraordinary Scenes of this Nature. He sat for his Picture at my Desire: It was to Allan Ramsay, who has succeeded to Admiration, and has made me a most valuable Portrait.</p><p>I am very sorry for Lord Nisbet:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020026b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> His Family has made a great Loss. Were his Projects all finish'd and to Advantage. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Home. I am now longing much to be at home. <span class="linelast">Your affectionate Brother</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Lisle Street Leicester Fields</span> <span class="date">22 Of March 1766</span></p></div>
