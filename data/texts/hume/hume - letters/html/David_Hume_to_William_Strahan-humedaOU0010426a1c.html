	<div id="humedaOU0010426a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have long expected to hear from you and to learn your Sentiments of English Politics, according to the Promise you made me on parting: Perhaps, you have as long expected to hear from me; and thus while we stand upon Ceremony, our Correspondence is never likely to begin.</span> But I have now broke the Ice, and it will be your Fault, if our Commerce of Letters does not continue.</p><p>I have been on the Watch this Winter for any Publication, which might answer in an English Translation, and have even fix'd a Correspondence with one of the Licencers of the Press to give me early Intelligence; but there has nothing appeard, which I thought woud answer, except Voltaire's Treatise of Toleration,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010426a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> of which only a very few stolen copies came here, and it was impossible for me to procure one.</p><p>Are you acquainted with the Merit of Madame Riccoboni's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010426a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Novels? She is the Author of Lady Juliette Catesby, and others which have been very well receivd both in France and England; and are indeed wrote with great Elegance and Decency. She has just now in the Press a Novel, wrote upon English Manners, from which great Success is expected.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010426a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Woud you think it worthy of being translated? I coud get from her some Sheets of it, which I woud send you by a Courier, and which woud secure you the Property: The rest I woud send by any Traveller, of whom Numbers set out every day.</p><p>As she is a Woman of Merit, but poor, any small Present, proportiond to the Success of the Work, I shall only mention in general, and shall leave the Amount of it to your own Discretion afterwards.</p><p>Please to direct to me, under Cover to the Earl of Hertford, and send your Letters to Northumberland House in the Strand.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir <br />Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">20 March, 1764.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p>Pray inform me, if you can, of the Reason of this continued low Price of Stocks: They say, that Money is as scarce in private Transactions. But what is the Reason of that, after the Peace has been establishd for above a twelve month?</p><p>Since I wrote the above, I have procurd the two first printed Sheets, from Mad<sup>e</sup> Riccoboni. They will secure you the Property, if you think proper to have them translated, which I think they very much deserve. The whole will make two small Volumes.</p><p>These are the proof Sheets corrected. The Translator must follow the Corrections on the Margins. What do you think of a French Edition also of the Original?</p></div></div>
