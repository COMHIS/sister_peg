	<div id="humedaOU0010427a1c"><p class="salutation">My dear Sir</p><p>I believe I need not inform you how little I have been always inclin'd to sollicit the Great, or even my Friends, for any thing that regards my own Fortune. I may venture to say, that, hitherto, I have never once made any Applications of this Nature; and you may wonder that now, at my Years, when the greatest Part of Life is past, and I may esteem myself, in other Respects, pretty much at my Ease, I shoud submit to prefer Requests which I declin'd at an Age when Ambition ought naturally to be stronger, and when my Circumstances much more powerfully calld for Assistance. But the Step I take at present is at Lord Hertford's Desire; who, being determin'd to make it a Point that I shoud have the Credentials &amp; Appointments of Secretary to the Embassy, expressd his Wish that I shoud also apply to all my own Friends on the same Subject. My Obligations to him are so great, that, even were I more reluctant, I coud not have declin'd Compliance; and surely I can have but small Reluctance to apply to you, one of my best Friends, with whom I have long liv'd in a Course of Intimacy &amp; good Correspondence.</p><p>I remember that the last time I had the Pleasure of seeing you, you said, that I no doubt wonder'd how it happen'd, that while the Prime Minister &amp; Favourite,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010427a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> who inclin'd to be a Maecenas, &amp; who bore me no ill Will, was surrounded by all my most particular Friends,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010427a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I shoud never have experienc'd any good Effects from their Credit. I own that I never was surprizd; not from any Diffidence of them, but from some obvious Objections. Now all these Objections are remov'd by Lord Hertford's Friendship: Nobody, henceforth, need be afraid to patronise me, either as a Scotsman or a Deist. This Circumstance encourages me in my present Application to my Friends.</p><p>Surely it is impossible to give them a juster &amp; more plausible Cause to support than mine? I do the Functions here of Secretary to the Embassy. Is it not scandalous that another should live in London &amp; draw the Sallary?</p><p>Is it for the Credit of Government, that such Abuses shoud appear to foreign Nations? Is it good Policy to send an Ambassador to the most important of all foreign Employments, &amp; yet declare that he has so little Credit at home, as not to have the Choice of his own Secretary?</p><p>I shall not say that the Partiality I meet with here will make these Abuses more remark'd, than if another Person, less known, were concern'd. But surely the Government puts me in a Situation which ought to render me entirely useless to Lord Hertford, by refusing me a Character which shoud have appear'd necessary, in order to gain me Admittance into Company.</p><p>Allow me to inform you of another Circumstance, which renders my prevailing in this Point the most material Step to my future Fortune. When I came to London, &amp; found, contrary to Lord Hertford's Opinion, that Mr Bunbury was likely to keep his Appointments, I declin'd going abroad, unless something certain was fix'd in my Favour. My Lord said, that he woud obtain me, from the Public, a Settlement of 200 a Year for Life, or woud give me as much from his private Fortune. He apply'd to the King, who agreed; to Mr Grenville,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010427a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> who also consented. Two days before we came off, my Pension was fix'd on the most precarious Footing of all Pensions, by a simple Order from the Treasury to their Secretary. Yet Mr Grenville told my Lord, that this was equivalent to a Settlement for Life. My Lord believes so still; but I well know the contrary, tho' I said nothing, perhaps from a foolish Delicacy, as the time of our Departure so near approach'd, &amp; it was difficult then to correct the Blunder. Were I to return to England, on my present Footing, I shou'd regard this Pension as absolutely insignificant, not worth two Years Purchase, and never coud form any Plan on the Supposition of its Duration. But had I obtain'd the Rank &amp; Character of Secretary to the Embassy, there are certain Pensions annex'd, by Custom, to certain Employments; and I believe I might more depend upon it.</p><p>You see then how materially my Interests are concern'd. I have wrote to others of my Friends, Sir Harry, Oswald, &amp; John Hume, in the same Style, that an Effort may be made, all at once, in my Favour. I own that, notwithstanding all the plausible Appearances, my Hopes of Success are but moderate. I have been accustom'd to meet with nothing but Insults &amp; Indignities from my native Country: But if it continue so, <em>ingrata patria, ne ossa quidem habebis</em>.</p><p class="signoff">I am My Dear Sir <br />Yours sincerely <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010427a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">27 March 1764.</span></p></div>
