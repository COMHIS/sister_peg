	<div id="humedaOU0020077a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Lisle Street Leicester Fields</span> <span class="date">12 Aug., 1766.</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">Nothing could more rejoice me than the sight of your handwriting after such long silence.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020077a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> My pleasure was not diminished by the contents of your letter: for though you reprove me with some vehemence, it is at the same time in so friendly and so reasonable a manner, that I kiss the rod which beats me, and give you as sincere thanks for your admonitions, as I ever did for any of your civilities and services. I am sensible that nothing could be more unsuitable to my attachment towards you, and my respect towards the Prince of Conti, than to have conducted myself so as that this story should have come to your ears by any other canal than through myself. But I considered you as one hundred leagues distant from Paris. I wrote indeed to Baron d'Olbach, without either recommending or expecting secrecy: but I thought this story, like others, would be told to eight or ten people; in a week or two, twenty or thirty more might hear of it, and it would require three months before it would reach you at Pougues. I little imagined, that a private story, told to a private gentleman, could run over a whole kingdom in a moment: if the King of England had declared war against the King of France, it could not have been more suddenly the subject of conversation. This, I own, misled me; I delayed writing to you a few posts, expecting every day to hear something that would enable me to give you a more decisive view of the affair, and at the same time might enable you to give me that counsel on which I so much depended. I ask you ten thousand pardons. You see my error proceeded only from a blunder in my reasoning. I beg it of you to make the Prince of Conti sensible of my contrition, after you have yourself pardoned me.</p><p>As to the other point, more material than any failure of civility even towards you, I mean my too great violence and precipitation in accusing Rousseau, I beg of you to weigh the following considerations: — Think of the effect of such an outrageous letter, wrote after a long train of civilities and services, and wrote at the very moment that I had consummated all these and brought them to a happy period. Consider also, that I immediately discovered, that this rage, if real, was not the result of a sudden passion in him, but had been secretly boiling in his breast during near three months, and had never relented a moment, even while I was rendering him the greatest services.</p><p>Reflect likewise, that his letter contained a most studied premeditated lie against me, viz. his account of our evening conversation the last time I saw him in London. You know I wrote you an account of that conversation, very opposite to that which he delivers. It was impossible that any report or mistake could mislead him in that particular: and nothing could aggravate the atrocity of such a lie; of a lie invented by him against me. But what chiefly determined me at once to break all measures with him and to make our rupture as public as possible, was, the consideration of his memoirs; in which I was, no doubt, to make a fine figure. I have mentioned this circumstance to you already. You see it is always uppermost in his thoughts. He flatters me obliquely with his panegyrics in his letter of the 22d of March: he threatens me with his satire in that of the 23d of June. What could I do in that situation? If I was to keep our rupture a secret, he would multiply his lies without number; and these would certainly gain the attention, and might gain the belief of the world, if supposed to come from a man who was living in friendship with me. The quarrel, you say, might have been made up: but a quarrel without the least pretence or reasons, never could be made up; for the cause still remained, viz. his obligations to me, which he never could forgive. There could not surely be less occasion of quarrel, if he had had common sense or gratitude, than when I was one hundred and fifty miles distant from him, and was occupying myself continually in his service.</p><p>Allow me to tell you, my dear friend, that the event has justified my reasoning. Though I wrote him a very decent letter, as you saw, I got back a studied oration, or invective, against me, of eighteen folio pages, full of the same virulence and lies contained in his short epistle. I have given some accounts of it to D'Alembert, who will communicate them to you. I should have wrote the same to you; but I knew not where you was, nor how to direct to you, nor when you was expected in Paris. I have drawn up the whole story in a short narrative, and have inserted all the letters and papers; and have delivered the pacquet to General Conway, to be sent by the first courier to M. D'Alembert. It is not with a view of having it published, which both he and I are averse to, but to lie by him in case of need, as he is so unexpectedly and absurdly brought into the quarrel. I have struck out your name in one place, as suspecting that you would not care to be mentioned in such an affair. When you peruse this long letter of Rousseau, you will think that it aggravates extremely his guilt, except only in one particular, that it gives us reason to suspect him an arrant madman.</p><p>All the conjectures that have been formed at Paris, are without foundation. No mortal ever gave him false information against me: he never heard of any such pleasantry as that you mention, if such a thing ever existed. He acknowledges I behaved always towards him with perfect civility while we lived together; but yet I was all along a perfidious traitor, in the manner you shall see, but never, I am sure, will be able to conjecture.</p><p>But, dear Madam, I find, that imperceptibly I owe him still a greater grudge than any I have mentioned: he occupies all my thoughts while I am writing to you, and gives me no leisure either to speak to you of myself, or any of our common friends. I hope the waters of Pougues agreed perfectly with the Prince of Conti. I hear Madame de Barbantane does not go to Florence, which pleases me very much. I ought to have wrote to her about this unhappy affair; but in desiring you to communicate to her my letter, I considered myself as writing to you in common. Lord Tavistock is very happy, as is also the Duke of Bedford, on account of the increase of his family by the accession of a new boy. I passed some days at Woburn lately. You know that every thing is decided here by bets. The Duke has taken My Lady Tavistock for a third son, against any woman in England who is not pregnant. I passed yesterday with Lord Holdernesse at Zion Hill: you may conjecture that you was mentioned at least once or twice by us. I was much satisfied with his account of the state of your health. The Bishop of Lavaur was so kind as to send me a copy of his sermon, which is as good as a sermon and a panegyric can well be. Your son still leaves<span href="/item/humedaOU0020077a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> you soon for Italy; and you are probably at this moment occupied in more worthy and more interesting details than any which can come to you from this part of the world. Write me, however, a short note, after you have perused my narrative. <span class="linelast">Believe me to be ever yours, with the greatest sincerity.</span></p></div>
