	<div id="humedaOU0010290a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">25 January, 1759.</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">What I wrote you with regard to Mary's concurrence in the conspiracy against Queen Elizabeth, was from the printed histories of papers; and nothing ever appeared to me more evident.</span> Your chief objection, I see, is derived from one circumstance, that neither the secretaries nor conspirators were confronted with Mary; but you must consider that the law did not then require this confrontation, and it was in no case the practice. The Crown could not well grant it in one case without granting it in all, because the refusing of it would then have been a strong presumption of innocence in the prisoner. Yet as Mary's was an extraordinary case, Elizabeth was willing to have granted it. I find in Forbes's MS. papers,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> sent me by Lord Royston,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> a letter of hers to Burleigh and Walsingham, wherein she tells them, that if they thought proper, they might carry down the two secretaries to Fotheringay, in order to confront them with her. But they reply, that they think it needless.</p><p>But I am now sorry to tell you, that by Murden's State Papers,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> which are printed, the matter is put beyond all question. I got these papers during the holidays, by Dr Birch's means; and as soon as I had read them, I ran to Mr Millar, and desired him very earnestly to stop the publication of your History till I should write to you, and give you an opportunity of correcting a mistake of so great moment; but he absolutely refused compliance. He said that your book was now finished, that the copies would be shipped for Scotland in two days, that the whole narration of Mary's trial must be wrote over again; that this would require time, and it was uncertain whether the new narrative could be brought within the same compass with the old; that this change, he said, would require the cancelling a great many sheets; that there were scattered passages through the volumes founded on your theory, and these must also be all cancelled, and that this change required the new printing of a great part of the edition. For these reasons, which do not want force, he refused, after deliberation, to stop his publication, and I was obliged to acquiesce. Your best apology at present is, that you could not possibly see the grounds of Mary's guilt, and every equitable person will excuse you.</p><p>I am sorry, on many accounts, that you did not see this Collection of Murden's. Among other curiosities, there are several instructions to H. Killigrew, dated 10th Sept. 1572.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> He was then sent into Scotland. It there appears, that the Regents, Murray and Lennox, had desired Mary to be put into their hands, in order to try her and put her to death. Elizabeth there offers to Regent Mar to deliver her up, provided good security were given, 'that she should receive that she hath deserved there by order of Justice, whereby no futher peril should ensue by her escaping, or by setting her up again.' It is probable Mar refused compliance, for no steps were taken towards it.</p><p>I am nearly printed out, and shall be sure to send you a copy by the stage coach, or some other conveyance. I beg of you to make remarks as you go along. It would have been much better had we communicated before printing, which was always my desire, and was most suitable to the friendship which always did, and I hope always will, subsist between us. I speak this chiefly on my own account. For tho I had the perusal of your sheets before I printed, I was not able to derive sufficient benefits from them, or indeed to make any alteration by their assistance. There still remain, I fear, many errors, of which you could have convinced me, if we had canvassed the matter in conversation. Perhaps I might also have been sometimes no less fortunate with you. Particularly I could almost undertake to convince you, that the Earl of Murray's conduct with the Duke of Norfolk was no way dishonourable.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p><p>I have seen a copy of your History with Charles Stanhope.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Lord Willoughby,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> who had been there reading some passages of it, said, that you was certainly mistaken with regard to the Act passed in the last Parliament of Mary, settling the Reformation.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> He said that the Act of Parliament, the first of James, was no proof of it; for tho that statute contains a statute where the Queen's name was employed, yet that is always the case with the bills brought into Parliament, even tho they receive not the royal assent, nor perhaps pass the Houses. I wish this be not the case, considering the testimony of Buchanan,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> Calderwood,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> and Spotswood.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> Besides, if the Bill had before received the royal assent, what necessity of repeating it, or passing it again? Mary's title was more undisputable than James's.</p><p>Dr Blair<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> tells me, that Prince Edward<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> is reading you, and is charmed. I hear the same of the Princess<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> and Prince of Wales.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> But what will really give you pleasure, I lent my copy to Elliot during the holidays, who thinks it one of the finest performances he ever read; and tho he expected much, he finds more. He remarked, however, (which is also my opinion) that in the beginning, before your pen was sufficiently accustomed to the historic style, you employ too many digressions and reflections. This was also somewhat my own case, which I have corrected in my new edition.</p><p>Millar was proposing to publish me about the middle of March, but I shall communicate to him your desire, even tho I think it entirely groundless, as you will likewise think after you have read my volume. He has very needlessly delayed your publication till the first of February, at the desire of the Edinburgh booksellers, who could no way be affected by a publication in London. I was exceedingly sorry not to be able to comply with your desire, when you expressed your wish, that I should not write this period. I could not write downward. For when you find occasion, by new discoveries, to correct your opinion with regard to facts which passed in Queen Elizabeth's days; who, that has not the best opportunities of informing himself, could venture to relate any recent transactions? I must therefore have abandoned altogether this scheme of the English History, in which I had proceeded so far, if I had not acted as I did. You will see what light and force this History of the Tudors bestows on that of the Stuarts. Had I been prudent I should have begun with it. I care not to boast, but I will venture to say, that I have now effectually stopped the mouths of all those villainous Whigs who railed at me.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010290a1c/nts/016" title="16 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">16</span></p><p>You are so kind as to ask me about my coming down. I can yet answer nothing. I have the strangest reluctance to change places. I lived several years happy with my brother at Ninewells, and had not his marriage changed a little the state of the family, I believe I should have lived and died there. I used every expedient to evade this journey to London, yet it is now uncertain whether I shall ever leave it. I have had some invitations, and some intentions of taking a trip to Paris; but I believe it will be safer for me not to go thither, for I might probably settle there for life. No one was ever endowed with so great a portion of the <em>vis inertiae</em>. <span class="linelast">But as I live here very privately, and avoid as much as possible (and it is easily possible) all connexions with the Great, I believe I should be better at Edinburgh . . . .</span></p></div>
