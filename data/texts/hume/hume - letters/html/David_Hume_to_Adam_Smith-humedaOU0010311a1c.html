	<div id="humedaOU0010311a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">Your Friend, Mr Wilson,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> calld on me two or three days ago when I was abroad, &amp; he left your Letter: I did not see him till to day.</span> He seems a very modest, sensible, ingenious Man. Before I saw him, I spoke to A. Millar about him, &amp; found him very much dispos'd to serve him. I proposd particularly to Mr Millar, that it was worthy of so eminent a Bookseller as he to make a compleat elegant Set of the Classics, which might set up his Name equal to the Alduses, Stevens, or Elzivirs; and that Mr Wilson was the properest Person in the World to assist him in such a Project. He confest to me, that he had sometimes thought of it; but that his great Difficulty was to find a Man of Letters, who cou'd correct the Press. I mentioned the Matter to Wilson, who said he had a Man of Letters in his Eye; one Lyon,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> a nonjuring Clergyman at Glasgow. He is probably known to you, or at least may be so: I wou'd desire your Opinion of him.</p><p>Mr Wilson told me of his Machines, which seem very ingenious, &amp; deserve much Encouragement. I shall soon see them.</p><p>I am very well acquainted with Bourke,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> who was much taken with your Book. He got your Direction from me with a View of writing to you, &amp; thanking you for your Present: For I made it pass in your Name. I wonder he has not done it: He is now in Ireland. I am not acquainted with Jennyns;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> but he spoke very highly of the Book to Oswald, who is his Brother in the Board of Trade. Millar show'd me a few days ago a Letter from Lord Fitz-maurice;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> where he tells him, that he had carryd over a few Copies to the Hague for Presents. Mr Yorke<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> was much taken with it as well as several others who had read it.</p><p>I am told that you are preparing a new Edition,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> &amp; propose to make some Additions &amp; Alterations, in order to obviate Objections. I shall use the Freedom to propose one, which, if it appears to be of any Weight, you may have in your Eye. I wish you had more particularly and fully prov'd, that all kinds of Sympathy are necessarily Agreeable. This is the Hinge of your System, &amp; yet you only mention the Matter cursorily in p. 20. Now it woud appear that there is a disagreeable Sympathy, as well as an agreeable: And indeed, as the Sympathetic Passion is a reflex Image of the principal, it must partake of its Qualities, &amp; be painful where that is so. Indeed, <em>when we converse with a man with whom we can entirely sympathize</em>, that is, where there is a warm &amp; intimate Friendship, the cordial openness of such a Commerce overpowers the Pain of a disagreeable Sympathy, and renders the whole Movement agreeable. But in ordinary Cases, this cannot have place. An illhumord Fellow; a man tir'd &amp; disgusted with every thing, always <em>ennuié</em>; sickly, complaining, embarass'd; such a one throws an evident Damp on Company, which I suppose wou'd be accounted for by Sympathy; and yet is disagreeable.</p><p>It is always thought a difficult Problem to account for the Pleasure, receivd from the Tears &amp; Grief &amp; Sympathy of Tragedy; which would not be the Case, if all Sympathy was agreeable. An Hospital woud be a more entertaining Place than a Ball. I am afraid that in p. 99 and 111 this Proposition has escapd you, or rather is interwove with your Reasonings in that place. You say expressly, <em>it is painful to go along with Grief &amp; we always enter into it with Reluctance</em>. It will probably be requisite for you to modify or explain this Sentiment, &amp; reconcile it to your System.</p><p>My Dear Mr Smith; You must not be so much engross'd with your own Book, as never to mention mine. The Whigs, I am told, are anew in a Rage against me; tho' they know not how to vent themselves : For they are constrain'd to allow all my Facts. You have probably seen Hurd's Abuse of me.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010311a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> He is of the Warburtonian School; and consequently very insolent and very scurrilous; but I shall never reply a word to him. If my past Writings do not sufficiently prove me to be no Jacobite, ten Volumes in folio never would.</p><p>I signd yesterday an Agreement with Mr Millar; where I mention that I proposd to write the History of England from the Beginning till the Accession of Henry the VII; &amp; he engages to give me 1400 Pounds for the Copy. This is the first previous Agreement ever I made with a Bookseller. I shall execute this Work at Leizure, without fatiguing myself by such ardent Application as I have hitherto employd. It is chiefly as a Ressource against Idleness, that I shall undertake this Work: For as to Money, I have enough: And as to Reputation, what I have wrote already will be sufficient, if it be good: If not, it is not likely I shall now write better. I found it impracticable (at least fancy'd so) to write the History since the Revolution. I am in doubt whether I shall stay here &amp; execute the Work; or return to Scotland, &amp; only come up here to consult the Manuscripts. I have several Inducements on both Sides. Scotland suits my Fortune best, &amp; is the Seat of my principal Friendships; but it is too narrow a Place for me, and it mortifies me that I sometimes hurt my Friends. Pray write me your Judgement soon. Are the Bigots much in Arms on account of this last Volume? Robertson's Book has great Merit; but it was visible that he profited here by the Animosity against me. I suppose the Case was the same with you. I am</p><p> <span class="linelast">Dear Smith <br />Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">28 July 1759.</span></p></div>
