	<div id="rousjeVF0310184a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">20 of Nov. 1766</span>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>I readily agree with you, my dear Sir, that it is a great misfortune to be reduced to the necessity of consenting to this publication; but it had certainly become necessary. Even those who at first joined me in rejecting all idea of it, wrote to me and represented, that this strange man's defiances had made such impression, that I should pass universally for the guilty person, if I suppressed the story. Some of his greatest admirers and partisans, who had read my manuscript, concurred in the same sentiments with the rest. I never consented to anything with greater reluctance in my life. Had I found one man of my opinion, I should have persevered in my refusal. One reason of my reluctance was, that I saw this publication, if necessary at Paris, was yet superfluous, not to say worse, at London. But I hope it will be considered that the publication is not, properly speaking, my deed, but that of my friends, in consequence of a discretionary power which I gave them, and which it was natural for me to give them, as I was at too great a distance to form a judgment in this case.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>I am as sensible as you are of the ridicule to which men of letters have exposed themselves, by running every moment to the public with all their private squabbles and altercations; but surely there has been something very unexpected and peculiar in this affair. My antagonist, by his genius, his singularities, his quackery, his misfortunes, and his adventures, had become more the subject of general conversation in Europe (for I venture again on the word) than any person in it. I do not even except Voltaire, much less the King of Prussia and Mr Pitt. How else could it have happened, that a clause of a private letter, which I wrote somewhat thoughtlessly to a private gentleman at Paris<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, should in three days' time have been the only subject of conversation in that capital, and should thence have propagated itself every where as fast as the post could carry it? You know, that at first I was so little inclined to make a noise about this story, that I had entertained thoughts of giving no reply at all to the insult, which was really so ridiculous: but you very properly dissuaded me from this resolution; and by your advice I wrote that letter, which certainly nobody will find fault with.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>Having made this apology for myself (where, however, I expect to be absolved as much by your compassion as your judgment), I proceed to say something in favour of my friends. Allow me then to inform you, that it was not D'Alembert who suppressed that clause of your letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, but me, who did not transcribe it in the copy I sent to Paris. I was afraid of engaging you needlessly in a quarrel with these literati; and as that clause had no reference to the business in hand, I thought I might fairly secrete it. I wish I could excuse him as well on another head. He sent me above two months ago something like that declaration<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>, and desired me to convey it to Rousseau; which I refused to do, and gave him some reasons of my refusal: but he replied to me; that he was sure my true secret reason was my regard to you<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>. He ought thence to have known, that it would be disagreeable to me to see such a piece annexed to mine. I have remarked also the omission of a phrase in the translation; and this omission could not be altogether by accident: it was where I mention your suppressing the King of Prussia's letter, while we lived together at Paris. I said it was <em>agreeable to your usual politeness and humanity</em>. I have wrote to Becket the book-seller to restore this passage, which is so conformable to my real sentiments: but whether my orders have come in time, I do not know as yet<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>. Before I saw the Paris edition, I had desired Becket to follow it wherever it departed from my original. The difference, I find, was in other respects inconsiderable.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>It is only by conjecture I imagine, that D'Alembert's malevolence to you (if he has any malevolence) proceeds from your friendship with Madame du Deffand; because I can find no other ground for it. I see also, that in his declaration there is a stroke obliquely levelled at her<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>, which perhaps you do not understand, but I do; because he wrote me that he heard she was your corrector<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>. I found these two persons in great and intimate friendship when I arrived at Paris: but it is strange how intemperate they are both become in their animosity; tho perhaps it is more excusable in her, on account of her age, sex, and bodily infirmities. I am very sensible of your discretion in not citing me on this occasion; I might otherwise have a new quarrel on my hands.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>With regard to D'Alembert I believe I said he was a man of <em>superior parts</em>, not a <em>superior genius</em>; which are words, if I mistake not, of a very different import. He is surely entitled to the former character, from the works which you and I have read: I do not mean his translation of Tacitus, but his other pieces. But I believe he is more entitled to it from the works which I suppose neither you nor I have read, his Geometry and Algebra. I agree with you, that in some respects Rousseau may more properly be called a superior genius; yet is he so full of extravagance, that I am inclined to deny even him that appellation. I fancy D'Alembert's talents and Rousseau's united might fully merit such a eulogy.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 6]</span></p><p>In other respects, D'Alembert is a very agreeable companion, and of irreproachable morals. By refusing great offers from the Czarina and the King of Prussia, he has shown himself above interest and vain ambition. He lives in an agreeable retreat at Paris, suitable to a man of letters. He has five pensions: one from the King of Prussia, one from the French King, one as member of the Academy of Sciences, one as member of the French Academy, and one from his own family. The whole amount of these is not 6000 livres a year; on the half of which he lives decently, and gives the other half to poor people with whom he is connected. In a word, I scarce know a man, who, with some few exceptions (for there must always be some exceptions), is a better model of a <em>virtuous</em> and <em>philosophical</em> character.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 7]</span></p><p>You see I venture still to join these epithets as inseparable and almost synonymous; tho you seem to regard them almost as incompatible. And here I have a strong inclination to say a few words in vindication both of myself and of my friends, venturing even to comprehend you in the number. What new prepossession has seized you to beat in so outrageous a manner your nurses of Mount Helicon, and to join the outcry of the ignorant multitude against science and literature? For my part, I can scarce acknowledge any other ground of distinction between one age and another, between one nation and another, than their different progress in learning and the arts. I do not say between one man and another; because the qualities of the heart and temper and natural understanding are the most essential to the personal character; but being, I suppose, almost equal among nations and ages, do not serve to throw a peculiar lustre on any. You blame France for its fond admiration of men of genius; and there may no doubt be, in particular instances, a great ridicule in these affectations: but the sentiment in general was equally conspicuous in ancient Greece, in Rome during its flourishing period, in modern Italy, and even perhaps in England about the beginning of this century. If the case be now otherwise, it is what we are to lament and be ashamed of. Our enemies will only infer, that we are a nation which was once at best but half civilised, and is now relapsing fast into barbarism, ignorance, and superstition. I beg you also to consider the great difference in point of morals between uncultivated and civilized ages. â But I find I am launching out insensibly into an immense ocean of commonplace; I cut the matter therefore short, by declaring it as my opinion, that if you had been born a barbarian, and had every day cooked your dinner of horseflesh by riding on it fifty miles between your breech and the shoulder of your horse, you had certainly been an obliging, good-natured, friendly man; but at the same time that reading, conversation, and travel have detracted nothing from those virtues, and have made a considerable addition of other valuable and agreeable qualities to them. I remain, not with ancient sincerity, which was only roguery and hypocrisy, but very sincerely, Dear Sir,</p><p>Your most obedient and most humble servant,</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 8]</span></p><p>The French translation of this strange piece of mine (for I must certainly give it that epithet) was not made by D'Alembert, but by one under his direction<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310184a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>.</p></div></div>
