	<div id="rousjeVF0330138a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>I have had Lord Holderness man with me, he's a very intelligent person, seems to understand the management of lands, a good mechanick, &amp; a much better Botanist than Rousseau. He approves of the Plough &amp; intends making use of one on my Lords Lands.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>The purport of the letter to General Conway<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330138a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> is amazing. I never heard him mention the Name of the Ministry so am surprised he should have wrote any thing about them, he did not<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330138a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> so much as know the Names of those employ'd in administration. If he has wrote any thing of that sort, it must have been whilst I was at London, for to my certain knowledge, his pen was engaged in quite other matters, at the time I left him.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>I have took it into my head, he's gone towards Orleans: latter end of last year his Governante lost her Mother<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330138a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, some small matter was to come to her, she told me that she wanted much to go for a while into that country. I own I long vastly to know where he is, &amp; how things are with him. I fancy Mr Du Tems<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330138a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> will have heard from him. He has left three large trunks at Wootton, &amp; I suspect many of his manuscripts, some I'm sure are, because he gave them me to lock up, if no mischief happens in France I almost imagine he will return.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>My Gout has not left me.</p><p>I am Dear Sir</p><p class="signoff">Your Most Obedient <br />Humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Rich<sup>d</sup> Davenport</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Davenport</span> <span class="date">June 11, 1767</span></p></div>
