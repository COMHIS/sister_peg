	<div id="humedaOU0010221a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I was out of Town for some days otherways the Sheet shou'd have been return'd sooner, along with an Answer to your obliging Letter.</span> I am of your Opinion, that it were much to be wish'd we cou'd publish the 2d Volume<span href="/item/humedaOU0010221a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the ensuing Winter; but I am afraid it will be impossible; at least, without hurrying myself more than I desire: To tell the Truth, I was so discourag'd this last Winter, that I have not been so assiduous as I might have been. Surely, never man was so torne in Pieces by Calumny. I thought I had been presenting to the Public a History full of Candor &amp; Disinterestedness, where I conquer'd some of the Prejudices of my Education, neglected my Attachments &amp; Views of Preferment, &amp; all for the Sake of Truth: When behold! I am dub'd a Jacobite, Passive Obedience Man, Papist, &amp; what not. But all this we must bear with Patience. The Public is the most capricious Mistress we can court; and we Authors, who write for Fame, must not be repuls'd by some Rigors, which are always temporary, where they are unjust. I am not surely unfavorable to the Parliament. Till they push'd their Advantages so far as to excite a civil War, so dangerous &amp; unnecessary, I esteem their Conduct laudable; &amp; to this Extremity nothing carry'd them but their furious Zeal for Presbytery: A low Bigotry, with which they sully'd a noble Cause. I did indeed endeavour to paint the King's Catastrophé (which was singular &amp; dismal) in as pathetic a manner as I cou'd: And to engage me, needed I any other Motive, than my Interest as a Writer, who desires to please &amp; interest his Readers?</p><p>I am glad that Mr Millar has renewd his Offer, which I find Baillie Hamilton is resolv'd to accept of. Every body writes me &amp; tells me, that the Conspiracy of the Booksellers contributed very much to retard the Sale. I hope, that Mr Millar's Industry will redress this Inconvenience; tho' it is not so easy to put right what has once been set wrong. We must have Patience, &amp; trust to time. If things succeed at present, Mr Millar, like the last Doctor, will get the Praise. You are better acquainted with these Matters than me: But if the Booksellers had not a great Influence, whence coud proceed the great Difference of the Sale in Scotland &amp; England? The Freedoms with Religion ought here to have given more Displeasure; &amp; the Cry of Jacobitism as much, notwithstanding what may be imagin'd.</p><p>I shall use the Precaution you desire with regard to our Letters; &amp; beg the Continuance of our Friendship &amp; Correspondence. I am Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <br /> <span class="date">3d of May, 1755</span></p></div>
