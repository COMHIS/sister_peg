I need not tell you, that I am your Countryman, a Scotchman; for without any such tye, I dare rely upon your Humanity, even to a perfect Stranger, such as I am. The Favour I beg of you is your Advice, &amp; the reason why I address myself in particular to you need not be told. As one must be a skilful Physician, a man of Letters, of Wit, of Good Sense, &amp; of great Humanity, to give me a satisfying Answer, I wish Fame had pointed out to me more Persons, in whom these Qualities are united, in order to have kept me some time in Suspense. This I say in the Sincerity of my Heart, &amp; without any Intention of making a Complement: For tho' it may seem necessary, that in the beginning of so unusual a Letter, I shou'd say some fine things, to bespeak your good Opinion, &amp; remove any prejudices you may conceive at it, yet such an Endeavor to be witty, would but ill suit with the present Condition of my Mind; which, I must confess, is not without Anxiety concerning the Judgement you will form of me. Trusting however to your Candor &amp; Generosity, I shall, without further Preface, proceed to open up to you the present Condition of my Health, &amp; to do that the more effectually shall give you a kind of History of my Life, after which you will easily learn, why I keep my Name a Secret.</p><p>You must know then that from my earliest Infancy, I found alwise a strong Inclination to Books &amp; Letters. As our College Education in Scotland, extending little further than the Languages, ends commonly when we are about 14 or 15 Years of Age, I was after that left to my own Choice in my Reading, &amp; found it encline me almost equally to Books of Reasoning &amp; Philosophy, &amp; to Poetry &amp; the polite Authors. Every one, who is acquainted either with the Philosophers or Critics, knows that there is nothing yet establisht in either of these two Sciences, &amp; that they contain little more than endless Disputes, even in the most fundamental Articles. Upon Examination of these, I found a certain Boldness of Temper, growing in me, which was not enclin'd to submit to any Authority in these Subjects, but led me to seek out some new Medium, by which Truth might be establisht. After much Study, &amp; Reflection on this, at last, when I was about 18 Years of Age, there seem'd to be open'd up to me a new Scene of Thought, which transported me beyond Measure, &amp; made me, with an Ardor natural to young men, throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it. The Law, which was the Business I design'd to follow, appear'd nauseous to me, &amp; I cou'd think of no other way of pushing my Fortune in the World, but that of a Scholar &amp; Philosopher. I was infinitely happy in this Course of Life for some Months; till at last, about the beginning of Sept<sup>r</sup> 1729, all my Ardor seem'd in a moment to be extinguisht, &amp; I cou'd no longer raise my Mind to that pitch, which formerly gave me such excessive Pleasure. I felt no Uneasyness or Want of Spirits, when I laid aside my Book; &amp; therefore never imagind there was any bodily Distemper in the Case, but that my Coldness proceeded from a Laziness of Temper, which must be overcome by redoubling my Application. In this Condition I remain'd for nine Months, very uneasy to myself, as you may well imagine, but without growing any worse, which was a Miracle.</p><p>There was another particular, which contributed more than any thing, to waste my Spirits &amp; bring on me this Distemper, which was, that having read many Books of Morality, such as Cicero, Seneca &amp; Plutarch, &amp; being smit with their beautiful Representations of Virtue &amp; Philosophy, I undertook the Improvement of my Temper &amp; Will, along with my Reason &amp; Understanding. I was continually fortifying myself with Reflections against Death, &amp; Poverty, &amp; Shame, &amp; Pain, &amp; all the other Calamities of Life. These no doubt are exceeding useful, when join'd with an active Life; because the Occasion being presented along with the Reflection, works it into the Soul, &amp; makes it take a deep Impression, but in Solitude they serve to little other Purpose, than to waste the Spirits, the Force of the Mind meeting with no Resistance, but wasting itself in the Air, like our Arm when it misses its Aim. This however I did not learn but by Experience, &amp; till I had already ruin'd my Health, tho' I was not sensible of it.</p><p>Some Scurvy Spots broke out on my Fingers, the first Winter I fell ill, about which I consulted a very knowing Physician, who gave me some Medicines, that remov'd these Symptoms, &amp; at the same time gave me a Warning against the Vapors, which, tho I was laboring under at that time, I fancy'd myself so far remov'd from, &amp; indeed from any other Disease, except a slight Scurvy, that I despis'd his Warning. At last about Aprile 1730, when I was 19 Years of Age, a Symptom, which I had notic'd a little from the beginning, encreas'd considerably, so that tho' it was no Uneasyness, the Novelty of it made me ask Advice. It was what they call a Ptyalism or Watryness in the mouth. Upon my mentioning it to my Physician, he laught at me, &amp; told me I was now a Brother, for that I had fairly got the Disease of the Learned. Of this he found great Difficulty to perswade me, finding in myself nothing of that lowness of Spirit, which those, who labor under that Distemper so much complain of. However upon his Advice, I went under a Course of Bitters, &amp; Anti-hysteric Pills. Drunk an English Pint of Claret Wine every Day, &amp; rode 8 or 10 Scotch Miles. This I continu'd for about 7 Months after.</p><p>Tho I was sorry to find myself engag'd with so tedious a Distemper yet the Knowledge of it, set me very much at ease, by satisfying me that my former Coldness, proceeded not from any Defect of Temper or Genius, but from a Disease, to which any one may be subject. I now began to take some Indulgence to myself; studied moderately, &amp; only when I found my Spirits at their highest Pitch, leaving off before I was weary, &amp; trifling away the rest of my Time in the best manner I could. In this way, I liv'd with Satisfaction enough; and on my return to Town next Winter found my Spirits very much recruited, so that, tho they sunk under me in the higher Flights of Genius, yet I was able to make considerable Progress in my former Designs. I was very regular in my Diet &amp; way of Life from the beginning, &amp; all that Winter, made it a constant Rule to ride twice or thrice a week, &amp; walk every day. For these Reasons, I expected when I return'd to the Countrey, &amp; cou'd renew my Exercise with less Interruption, that I wou'd perfectly recover. But in this I was much mistaken. For next Summer, about May 1731 there grew upon [me] a very ravenous Appetite, &amp; as quick a Digestion, which I at first took for a good Symptom, &amp; was very much surpriz'd to find it bring back a Palpitation of Heart, which I had felt very little of before. This Appetite, however, had an Effect very unusual, which was to nourish me extremely; so that in 6 weeks time I past from the one extreme to the other, &amp; being before tall, lean, &amp; rawbon'd became on a sudden, the most sturdy, robust, healthful-like Fellow you have seen, with a ruddy Complexion &amp; a chearful Countenance. In excuse for my Riding, &amp; care of my Health, I alwise said, that I was afraid of a Consumption; which was readily believ'd from my Looks; but now every Body congratulate me upon my thorow Recovery. This unnatural Appetite wore off by degrees, but left me as a Legacy, the same Palpitation of the heart in a small degree, &amp; a good deal of Wind in my Stomach, which comes away easily, &amp; without any bad Goût, as is ordinary. However, these Symptoms are little or no Uneasyness to me. I eat well; I sleep well. Have no lowness of Spirits; at least never more than what one of the best Health may feel, from too full a meal, from sitting too near a Fire, &amp; even that degree I feel very seldom, &amp; never almost in the Morning or Forenoon. Those who live in the same Family with me, &amp; see me at all times, cannot observe the least Alteration in my Humor, &amp; rather think me a better Companion than I was before, as choosing to pass more of my time with them. This gave me such Hopes, that I scarce ever mist a days riding, except in the Winter-time; &amp; last Summer undertook a very laborious task, which was to travel 8 Miles every Morning &amp; as many in the Forenoon, to &amp; from a mineral Well of some Reputation. I renew'd the Bitters &amp; Anti-hysteric Pills twice, along with Anti-scorbutic Juices last Spring, but without any considerable Effect, except abating the Symptoms for a little time.</p><p>Thus I have given you a full account of the Condition of my Body, &amp; without staying to ask Pardon, as I ought to do, for so tedious a Story, shall explain to you how my Mind stood all this time, which on every Occasion, especially in this Distemper, have a very near Connexion together. Having now Time &amp; Leizure to cool my inflam'd Imaginations, I began to consider seriously, how I shou'd proceed in my Philosophical Enquiries. I found that the moral Philosophy transmitted to us by Antiquity, labor'd under the same Inconvenience that has been found in their natural Philosophy, of being entirely Hypothetical, &amp; depending more upon Invention than Experience. Every one consulted his Fancy in erecting Schemes of Virtue &amp; of Happiness, without regarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must depend. This therefore I resolved to make my principal Study, &amp; the Source from which I wou'd derive every Truth in Criticism as well as Morality. I believe 'tis a certain Fact that most of the Philosophers who have gone before us, have been overthrown by the Greatness of their Genius, &amp; that little more is requir'd to make a man succeed in this Study than to throw off all Prejudices either for his own Opinions or for this of others. At least this is all I have to depend on for the Truth of my Reasonings, which I have multiply'd to such a degree, that within these three Years, I find I have scribled many a Quire of Paper, in which there is nothing contain'd but my own Inventions. This with the Reading most of the celebrated Books in Latin, French &amp; English, &amp; acquiring the Italian, you may think a sufficient Business for one in perfect Health; &amp; so it wou'd, had it been done to any Purpose: But my Disease was a cruel Incumbrance on me. I found that I was not able to follow out any Train of Thought, by one continued Stretch of View, but by repeated Interruptions, &amp; by refreshing my Eye from Time to Time upon other Objects. Yet with this Inconvenience I have collected the rude Materials for many Volumes; but in reducing these to Words, when one must bring the Idea he comprehended in gross, nearer to him, so as to contemplate its minutest Parts, &amp; keep it steddily in his Eye, so as to copy these Parts in Order, this I found impracticable for me, nor were my Spirits equal to so severe an Employment. Here lay my greatest Calamity. I had no Hopes of delivering my Opinions with such Elegance &amp; Neatness, as to draw to me the Attention of the World, &amp; I wou'd rather live &amp; dye in Obscurity than produce them maim'd &amp; imperfect.</p><p>Such a miserable Disappointment I scarce ever remember to have heard of. The small Distance betwixt me &amp; perfect Health makes me the more uneasy in my present Situation. Tis a Weakness rather than a Lowness of Spirits which troubles me, &amp; there seems to be as great a Difference betwixt my Distemper &amp; common Vapors, as betwixt Vapors &amp; Madness.</p><p>I have notic'd in the Writings of the French Mysticks, &amp; in those of our Fanatics here, that, when they give a History of the Situation of their Souls, they mention a Coldness &amp; Desertion of the Spirit, which frequently returns, &amp; some of them, at the beginning, have been tormented with it many Years. As this kind of Devotion depends entirely on the Force of Passion, &amp; consequently of the Animal Spirits, I have often thought that their Case &amp; mine were pretty parralel, &amp; that their rapturous Admirations might discompose the Fabric of the Nerves &amp; Brain, as much as profound Reflections, &amp; that warmth or Enthusiasm which is inseperable from them.</p><p>However this may be, I have not come out of the Cloud so well as they commonly tell us they have done, or rather began to despair of ever recovering. To keep myself from being Melancholy on so dismal a Prospect, my only Security was in peevish Reflections on the Vanity of the World &amp; of all humane Glory; which, however just Sentiments they may be esteem'd, I have found can never be sincere, except in those who are possest of them. Being sensible that all my Philosophy wou'd never make me contented in my present Situation, I began to rouze up myself; &amp; being encourag'd by Instances of Recovery from worse degrees of this Distemper, as well as by the Assurances of my Physicians, I began to think of something more effectual, than I had hitherto try'd. I found, that as there are two things very bad for this Distemper, Study &amp; Idleness, so there are two things very good, Business &amp; Diversion; &amp; that my whole Time was spent betwixt the bad, with little or no Share of the Good. For this reason I resolved to seek out a more active Life, &amp; tho' I cou'd not quit my Pretensions in Learning, but with my last Breath, to lay them aside for some time, in order the more effectually to resume them.</p><p>Upon Examination I found my Choice confin'd to two kinds of Life; that of a travelling Governor &amp; that of a Merchant. The first, besides that it is in some respects an idle Life, was, I found, unfit for me; &amp; that because from a sedentary &amp; retir'd way of living, from a bashful Temper, &amp; from a narrow Fortune, I had been little accustom'd to general Companies, &amp; had not Confidence &amp; Knowledge enough of the World to push my Fortune or be serviceable in that way. I therefore fixt my Choice upon a Merchant; &amp; having got Recommendation to a considerable Trader in Bristol, I am just now hastening thither, with a Resolution to forget myself, &amp; every thing that is past, to engage myself, as far as is possible, in that Course of Life, &amp; to toss about the World, from the one Pole to the other, till I leave this Distemper behind me.</p><p>As I am come to London in my way to Bristol, I have resolved, if possible, to get your Advice, tho' I shou'd take this absurd Method of procuring it. All the Physicians, I have consulted, tho' very able, cou'd never enter into my Distemper; because not being Persons of great Learning beyond their own Profession, they were unacquainted with these Motions of the Mind. Your Fame pointed you out as the properest Person to resolve my Doubts, &amp; I was determin'd to have some bodies Opinion, which I cou'd rest upon in all the Varieties of Fears &amp; Hopes, incident to so lingering a Distemper. I hope I have been particular enough in describing the Symptoms to allow you to form a Judgement; or rather perhaps have been too particular. But you know 'tis a Symptom of this Distemper to delight in complaining &amp; talking of itself.</p><p>The Questions I wou'd humbly propose to you are: Whether among all these Scholars, you have been acquainted with, you have ever known any affected in this manner? Whether I can ever hope for a Recovery? Whether I must long wait for it? Whether my Recovery will ever be perfect, &amp; my Spirits regain their former Spring &amp; Vigor, so as to endure the Fatigue of deep &amp; abstruse thinking? Whether I have taken a right way to recover? I believe all proper Medicines have been us'd, &amp; therefore I need mention nothing of them.</p></div>
