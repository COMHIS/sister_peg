You have heard, no doubt, of that Project: The Circumstances of the Affair coud not be more honourable for him, nor coud the Honour be conferd on one who deserves it more.</p><p>I really believe with the French Author,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030193a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> of whom you have favourd me with an Extract, that the Circumstance of my being a Scotchman has been a considerable Objection to me: So factious is this Country! I expected, in entering on my literary Course, that all the Christians, all the Whigs, and all the Tories shoud be my Enemies: But it is hard, that all the English, Irish, and Welsh shoud be also against me. The Scotch, likewise, cannot be much my Friends, as no man is a Prophet in his own Country. However, it is some Consolation that I can bear up my Head under all this Prejudice.</p><p>I fancy that I must have recourse to America for Justice. You told me, I think, that your Countrymen in that part of the World intended to do me the Honour of giving an Edition of my Writings; and you promisd that you shoud recommend to them to follow this last Edition,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030193a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> which is in the Press. I now use the Freedom of reminding of it.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030193a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p><p>Pray, make my Compliments to Sir John Pringle,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030193a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> and tell him how much I wish for his Company; and be so good as give him a Description of the House I reserve for him in this Square. If you really go over to America, we hope you will not grudge us Sir John as a Legacy. I am</p><p> <span class="linelast">Dear Sir with great Truth and Regard <br />Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
