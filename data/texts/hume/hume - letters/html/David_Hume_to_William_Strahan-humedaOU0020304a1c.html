There was another Quarto Edition in one Volume six or seven Years before; but that Edition must be all sold off, as you have made four or five Editions since. Your Correction is certainly just; and I had evidently been guilty of an Error in my Pen.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p><p>I am glad to find there is a Prospect of a new Edition of my History.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> I was indeed apprehensive, that the blind Rage of Party had entirely obstructed the Sale of it. I am as anxious of Correctness as if I were writing to Greeks or French; and besides frequent Revisals, which I have given it since the last Edition, I shall again run over it very carefully, and shall send you a corrected Copy. About six Weeks hence, I shall send off by the Waggon the four first Volumes; and shall direct them to Mr Cadel's Shop, which will be more easily found than your House. The other four Volumes shall follow at Leizure. I remember an Author, who says, that one half of a man's Life is too little to write a Book; and the other half to correct it. I think, that I am more agreeably employ'd for myself in this manner, and perhaps more profitably for you, than if I were writing such Volumes as Macpherson's History,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> one of the most wretched <em>Productions</em> that ever came from your Press.</p><p><em>I am sorry, that I cannot agree with you, in your hopes of subduing and what is more difficult, of governing America. Think only of the great Kingdom of France which is within a days sailing of the small Island of Corsica; yet has not been able, in eight or nine Years, to subdue and govern it, contrary to [the] Sentiments of the Inhabitants. But the worst Effect of the Loss of America, will not be the Detriment to our</em> <em>Manufactures, which will be a mere trifle, or to our Navigation, which will not be considerable; but to the Credit and Reputation of Government, which has already but too little Authority. You will probably see a Scene of Anarchy and Confusion open'd at home, the best Consequence of which is a settled Plan of arbitrary Power; the worst, total Ruin and Destruction</em>.</p><p>I am extremely oblig'd to you for your Letter to Professor Wilson.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> I am afraid, however, that all Efforts in favour of Dr Wight will be in vain.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p><p>It seems, Dr Hunter<span href="/item/humedaOU0020304a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> supports a Friend of his; and nothing can be refusd him by the University. <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Yours most sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
