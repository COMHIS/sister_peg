One Reason why I was anxious to know the Sale of my History, was, that I might judge, whether I coud expect equal Access and Information in England: The Rage and Prejudice of Parties frighten me; and above all, this Rage against the Scots which is so dishonourable and indeed so infamous to the English Nation. We hear, that it encreases every day without the least Appearance of Provocation on our part: It has frequently made me resolve never in my Life to set foot on English Ground. I dread, if I shoud undertake a more modern History, the Impertinence &amp; Ill-manners, to which it wou'd expose me; and I was willing to know from you, whether former Prejudices had so far subsided, as to ensure me of a good Reception. You had wrote me a Letter from Kew, which I have never receiv'd. Your present Account gives me Encouragement.</p><p>If you have Occasion for a new Edition of my Essays, make it from the last in Octavo. I send you enclosd a Bill on Mr Coutts for 12 pounds four Shillings, which I think is the Ballance I owe you, after deducting the Price of Coke, which I sent back. The enclosd is an Account of a Deficiency, which you will be so good as to supply. You sent me the Book imperfect. I beg sincerely my Compliments to Mrs Millar &amp; am</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D. H.</span></p></div>
