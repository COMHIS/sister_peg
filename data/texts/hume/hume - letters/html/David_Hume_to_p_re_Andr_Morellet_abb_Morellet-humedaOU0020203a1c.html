	<div id="humedaOU0020203a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">10 July, 1769.</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I congratulate you, dear Abbé, upon your being so far advanced in your labours.</span> You have now a prospect of a conclusion: I expect great entertainment and instruction from your work; and your prospectus is an excellent specimen of it. I wish only you had taken care to supply M. Frances<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> with a number of receipts for subscribers. I belong to a very numerous club in London,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> among whom I could have found many subscribers, if I had had receipts to give them, and M. Frances promised to procure them for me; but has not yet been able to make good his engagement. I hope the profit of the subscription is for yourself; and that you, as well as the public, will reap benefit by this undertaking. M. Suard would tell you what noble encouragement is given to literature in England, without the intervention of the great, by means of the booksellers alone, that is, by the public. Dr Robertson received £4000 for his Charles V, the greatest price that was ever known to be given for any book. It has been published about four months, and has met here with universal approbation. It is owned that there never was a more elegant spirited narration; and the first volume contains very curious matter, unknown to the generality of readers. But the sale to the booksellers has not quite answered expectation, in which they seem to have been too sanguine. For as the subject consists of a period, which neither interests much the present age nor this nation, the book, though perfectly well writ, does not run off so fast as they fondly imagined. There are only about 2900 sold, which yet is a great number. The translation is probably published by this time at Paris, and I hope with good success.</p><p>That part of your prospectus, in which you endeavour to prove that there enters nothing of human convention in the establishment of money, is certainly very curious, and very elaborately composed; and yet I cannot forbear thinking that the common opinion has some foundation. It is true, money must always be made of some materials, which have intrinsic value, otherwise it would be multiplied without end, and would sink to nothing. But, when I take a shilling, I consider it not as a useful metal, but as something which another will take from me; and the person who shall convert it into metal is, probably, several millions of removes distant. You know that all states have made it criminal to melt their coin; and, tho this is a law which cannot well be executed, it is not to be supposed that, if it could, it would entirely destroy the value of the money, according to your hypothesis. You have a base coin, called billon, in France, composed of silver and copper, which has a ready currency, tho the separation of the two metals, and the reduction of them to their primitive state, would, I am told, be both expensive and troublesome. Our shillings and sixpences, which are almost our only silver coin, are so much worn by use, that they are twenty, thirty, or forty per cent below their original value; yet they pass currency; which can arise only from a tacit convention. Our colonies in America, for want of specie, used to coin a paper currency; which were not bank notes, because there was no place appointed to give money in exchange: yet this paper currency passed in all payments, by convention; and might have gone on, had it not been abused by the several assemblies, who issued paper without end, and thereby discredited the currency.</p><p>You mention several kinds of money, sheep, oxen, fish, employed as measures of exchange, or as money, in different parts of the world. You have overlooked that, in our colony of Pennsylvania, the land itself, which is the chief commodity, is coined, and passes in circulation. The manner of conducting this affair is as follows: — A planter, immediately after he purchases any land, can go to a public office and receive notes to the amount of half the value of his land; which notes he employs in all payments, and they circulate through the whole colony, by convention. To prevent the public from being overwhelmed by this fictitious money, there are two means employed — first, the notes issued to any one planter, must not exceed a certain sum, whatever may be the value of his land: secondly, every planter is obliged to pay back into the public office every year one tenth part of his notes; the whole, of course, is annihilated in ten years; after which, it is again allowed him to take out new notes to half the value of his land. An account of this curious operation would enrich your dictionary; and you may have a more particular detail of it, if you please, from Dr Franklin, who will be in Paris about this time, and will be glad to see you. I conveyed to him your prospectus, and he expressed to me a great esteem of it.</p><p>I see that, in your prospectus, you take care not to disoblige your economists,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> by any declaration of your sentiments; in which I commend your prudence. But I hope that in your work you will thunder them, and crush them, and pound them, and reduce them to dust and ashes! They are, indeed, the set of men the most chimerical and most arrogant that now exist, since the annihilation of the Sorbonne. I ask your pardon for saying so, as I know you belong to that venerable body. I wonder what could engage our friend, M. Turgot, to herd among them; I mean, among the economists; tho I believe he was also a Sorbonnist.</p><p>I sent your prospectus to Dr Tucker, but have not heard from him since. I shall myself deliver copies to Dr Robertson and Mr Smith, as I go to Scotland this autumn.</p><p>And now, my dear Abbé, what remains to me but to wish you success in your judicious labours? To embrace you, and through you, to embrace all our common friends, D'Alembert, Helvétius, Buffon, Baron d'Holbach, Suard, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse? Poor Abbé Le Bon is dead, I hear. The Abbé Galiani<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> goes to Naples: he does well to leave Paris before I come thither; for I should certainly put him to death for all the ill he has spoken of England. But it has happened, as was fortold by his friend, Caraccioli;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> who said that the Abbé would remain two months in this country, would speak all himself, would not allow an Englishman to utter a syllable; and after returning would give the character of the nation during the rest of his life, as if he were perfectly well acquainted with them.</p><p>Pray make my compliments to M. Maletête.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Tell him, that Prince Masserane<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> says, that he has saved much effusion of blood to this country. It is certain that M. Maletête had a great curiosity to see a riot here, and yet was resolved to keep his person in safety. For this purpose, he hired a window; and proposed to be present at one of the mad elections of Wilkes, and to divert himself with the fray. Somebody got a hint of it, and put it into the newspapers; asking the freeholders if they were so degenerate as to make themselves a laughing-stock, even to the French, their enemies, whom they despised. Prince Masserane alleges that this incident made that election so remarkably peaceable!</p><p>Are you acquainted with Crébillon?<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> I am ashamed to mention his name. He sent me over his last work, with a very obliging letter:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020203a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> but as I must write to him in French, I have never answered him. If all the English were as impertinent as I am, the Abbé Galiani would have reason to abuse us.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Abbé, after asking your blessing, <br />Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
