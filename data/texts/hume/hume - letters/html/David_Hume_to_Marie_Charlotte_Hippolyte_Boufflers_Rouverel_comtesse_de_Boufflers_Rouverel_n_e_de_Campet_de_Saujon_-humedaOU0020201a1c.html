	<div id="humedaOU0020201a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">5 of May, 1769.</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I was yesterday, dear Madam, very much alarmed, by a piece of intelligence, which I received from Madame de la Vaupalliere:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020201a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> that having engaged your daughter-in-law to submit to inoculation, the success had appeared very doubtful: she had a great number of pustules; her face was much covered with them, her life was not out of danger, and the consequences in general were much apprehended.</span> You may easily imagine to what degree I interest myself in this event. I foresee that, if any sinister accident happen, you will be inclined, besides regretting a person, to whom you are so much attached, to blame yourself for an advice the best founded in reason and experience. As the issue must now be perfectly known, I beg to be informed of it: I cannot forbear hoping, that your anxiety has exaggerated the danger; and that all will still end happily.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020201a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p><p>We have had this winter two countrywomen of yours, very amiable persons, to whom I pay my court frequently, Madame de Chatelet<span href="/item/humedaOU0020201a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and Madame de Damas.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020201a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> The manners of the latter are generally taking, and she is very popular: the former, with a very superior merit, is better calculated for every situation, than that in which she is at present engaged, namely representation, in such a crowd as this town affords, and in such a hurry as everywhere presents itself: her good sense, and her frank easy humour, with her utter inability to dissemble, render her the best companion of the world in private society. I only regret in these two ladies that, having never had much commerce with you, I have not the satisfaction of hearing your name mentioned among them so frequently as I should be inclined to.</p><p>But I am afraid, dear Madam, of entertaining you with indifferent subjects, perhaps at a time when all your attention is engaged in the most interesting event: I shall therefore conclude; but with representing to you, that there was more sharpness in your last letter, than I ever thought should have passed between us.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020201a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Certainly, I was not blameable in ascribing to you a great desire of liberty and leisure, both because that sentiment is natural, and even laudable; and because I am myself so much possessed with it, that I think nothing can be compared to these blessings. <span class="linelast">In all cases, my mistake was innocent; and as I never meant to offend you, I doubt not, but, upon reflection, you will again restore me to your good graces, on which I set so high a value, and which, on that account, it is impossible for me ever to deserve to forfeit.</span></p></div>
