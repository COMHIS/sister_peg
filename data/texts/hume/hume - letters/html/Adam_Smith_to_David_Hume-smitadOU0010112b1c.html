Stand this ridicule, expose his brutal letter, but without giving it out of your own hand so that it may never be printed, and if you can, laugh at yourself, and I shall pawn my life that before three weeks are at an end, this little affair, which at present gives you so much uneasiness, shall be understood to do you as much honor as any thing that has ever happened to you. By endeavouring to unmask before the Public this hypocritical Pedant, you run the risk, of disturbing the tranquillity of your whole life. By letting him alone he cannot give you a fortnights uneasiness. To write against him, is, you may depend upon it, the very thing he wishes you to do. He is in danger of falling into obscurity in England and he hopes to make himself considerable by provoking an illustrious adversary. He will have a great party. The church, the Whigs, the Jacobites, the whole wise English nation, who will love to mortify a Scotchman, and to applaud a man that has refused a Pension from the King. It is not unlikely too that they may pay him very well for having refused it, and that even he may have had in view this compensation. Your whole friends here wish you not to write, the Baron,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> D'Alembert,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Madame Riccaboni,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Mademoiselle Riancourt,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Mr Turgot<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> etc. etc. Mr Turgot, a friend every way worthy of you, desired me to recommend this advice to you in a Particular manner, as his most earnest entreaty and opinion. He and I are both afraid that you are surrounded with evil counsellours, and that the Advice of your English literati, who are themselves accustomed to publish all their little gossiping stories in Newspapers, may have too much influence upon you. Remember me to Mr Walpole and believe me to be with the most sincere affection every yours</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Adam Smith</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>Make my apology to Millar<span href="/item/smitadOU0010112b1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> for not having yet answered his last very kind letter. I am preparing the Answer to it which he will certainly receive by next post. Remember me to Mrs Millar Do you ever see Mr Townshend.</p></div></div>
