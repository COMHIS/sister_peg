	<div id="humedaOU0030233a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p>So far from there being any Occasion to make me an Apology for your late Publication<span href="/item/humedaOU0030233a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> that you have prevented me in my Intentions of writing to you, and of returning you thanks for the Civility with which you have treated me. I had almost said unusual Civility. For to the Reproach of Learning, it is but too rare to find a literary Controversy conducted with proper Decency and Good Manners, especially where it turns upon religious Subjects, in which men often think themselves at Liberty to give way to their utmost Rancour and Animosity. But you like a true Philosopher, while you overwhelm me with the Weight of your Arguments, give me Encouragement by the Mildness of your Expressions: and instead of <em>Rouge, Rascal</em> and <em>Blockhead</em>, the illiberal Language of the Bishop of Glocester<span href="/item/humedaOU0030233a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and his School, you address me, as a man mistaken, but capable of Reason and conviction. I own to you, that the Light, in which you have put this Controversy, is new and plausible and ingenious, and perhaps solid. But I must have some more time to weigh it, before I can pronounce this Judgment with Satisfaction to myself. My present Occupations<span href="/item/humedaOU0030233a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> shall not deprive me of the Leizure requisite for that Purpose; as no Object can possibly have equal Importance. These Occupations, however, have bereav'd me of the satisfaction of waiting on you, and of thanking you in person for your Attention, which I should have thought my Duty, if I did not find my time so fully employ'd.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030233a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> I am with great Truth and Regard, Sir, your most obedient and most humble Servant.</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Brewer Street</span>, <span class="date">18 of March, 1767.</span></p></div>
