	<div id="humedaOU0030001a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p>I am very sorry I am not able to satisfy your Curiosity by giving you some general Notion of the Plan upon which I proceed. But my Opinions are so new, &amp; even some Terms I am oblig'd to make Use of, that I cou'd not propose by any Abridgement<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> to give my System an Air of Likelyhood, or so much as make it intelligible. Tis a thing I have in vain attempted already at a Gentleman's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Request in this Place, who thought it wou'd help him to comprehend &amp; judge of my Notions, if he saw them all at once before him. I have a greater Desire of communicating to you the Plan of the Whole, that I believe it will not appear in publick before the beginning of next Winter.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> For besides that it wou'd be difficult to have it printed before the rising of the Parliament; I must confess I am not ill-pleas'd with a little Delay, that it may appear with as few Imperfections as possible. I have been here near 3 months alwise within a Week of agreeing with Printers, &amp; you may imagine I did not forget the Work itself during that Time, where I began to feel some Passages weaker for the Style &amp; Diction than I cou'd have wisht. The Nearness &amp; Greatness of the Event rouz'd up my Attention, &amp; made me more difficult to please than when I was alone in perfect Tranquillity in France.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> But here I must tell you one of my Foibles. I have a great Inclination to go down to Scotland this Spring to see my Friends, &amp; have your Advice concerning my philosophical Discoveries; but cannot over-come a certain Shamefacedness<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> I have to appear among you at my Years without having yet a Settlement or so much as having attempted any. How happens it that we Philosophers cannot as heartily despise the World as it despises us? I think in my Conscience the Contempt were as well founded on our Side as on the other.</p><p>Having a frankt Letter<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> I was resolv'd to make Use of it, &amp; accordingly enclose some Reasonings concerning Miracles,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> which I once thought of publishing with the rest, but which I am afraid will give too much Offence even as the World is dispos'd at present. There is Something in the turn of Thought &amp; a good deal in the Turn of Expression, which will not perhaps appear so proper for want of knowing the Context: But the Force of the Argument you'll be judge of as it stands. Tell me your Thoughts of it. Is not the Style too diffuse? Tho as that was a popular Argument I have spread it out much more than the other Parts of the Work. I beg of you show it to no Body, except to Mr Hamilton,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> if he pleases; &amp; let me know at your Leizure that you have receiv'd it, read it, &amp; burnt it. I wou'd not even have you make another nameless Use of it, to which it wou'd not be improper, for fear of Accidents.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p>Your Thoughts &amp; mine agree with Respect to Dr Butler,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030001a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> &amp; I wou'd be glad to be introduc'd to him. I am at present castrating my Work, that is, cutting off its noble Parts, that is, endeavouring it shall give as little Offence as possible; before which I cou'd not pretend to put it into the Drs hands. This is a Piece of Cowardice, for which I blame myself; tho I believe none of my Friends will blame me. But I was resolv'd not to be an Enthusiast, in Philosophy, while I was blaming other Enthusiasms.</p><p>If ever I indulge any ‘twill be when I tell that I am,</p><p class="signoff">Dear Sir Yours. <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="date">December 2.1737</span></p></div>
