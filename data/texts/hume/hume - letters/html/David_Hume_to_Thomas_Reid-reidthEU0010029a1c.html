	<div id="reidthEU0010029a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">25 February 1763</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p>By Dr Blair's means, I have been favour'd with the Perusal of your Performance, which I have read with great Pleasure &amp; Attention. It is certainly very rare that a Piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so much Spirit and affords so much Entertainment to the Reader; tho' I must still regreat the Disadvantages under which I read it, as I never had the whole Performance at once before me, and could not be able fully to compare one Part with another. To this Reason chiefly I ascribe some Obscurities, which, in spite of your short Analysis or Abstract,<span href="/item/reidthEU0010029a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '*' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> still seems to hang over your System. For I must do you the Justice to own, that, where I enter into your Ideas, no Man appears to express himself with greater Perspicuity than you do; a Talent, which, above all others, is requisite in that Species of Literature, which you have cultivated. There are some Objections, which I would willingly propose to this fourth Chapter of Sight,<span href="/item/reidthEU0010029a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '*' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> did I not suspect that they proceed from my not sufficiently understanding it: And I am the more confirm'd in this Suspicion, as Dr Blair tells me, that the former Objections I made had been deriv'd chiefly from that Cause. I shall therefore forbear till the whole can lie before me, and shall not at present propose any farther Difficulties to your Reasonings I shall only say, that if you have been able to clear up these abstruse &amp; important Subjects, instead of being mortifyd, I shall be so vain as to pretend to a share of the Praise, and shall think, that my Errors, by having at least some Coherence, had led you to make a more strict Review of my Principles which were the common ones, and to perceive their Futility. As I was desirous to be of some Use to you, I kept a watchful Eye, all along, over your Style; but it is really so correct and so good English, that I found not any thing worth the remarking. There is only one Passage in this Chapter, where you make use of the Phraze <em>hinder to do</em> instead of <em>hinder from doing</em>,<span href="/item/reidthEU0010029a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '*' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> which is the English one; but I could not find the Passage when I sought for it. You may judge how unexceptionable the whole appeard to me, when I could remark so small a Blemish. I beg my Compliments to my friendly Adversaries, Dr Campbell &amp; Dr Gerard; and also to Dr Gregory, whom I suspect to be of the same Disposition, tho' he has not openly declard himself such.<span href="/item/reidthEU0010029a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '*' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I am with Sincerity Sir</p><p class="signoff">Your most obedient humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
