But how can you acquire knowledge of the great works of sculpture, architecture, and painting, by which that age was chiefly distinguished? Are you versed in all the anecdotes of the Italian literature? These questions I heard proposed in a company of literati when I enquired concerning this design of Warton. They applied their remarks to that gentleman, who yet, they say, has travelled. I wish they do not all of them fall more fully on you. However, you must not be idle. May I venture to suggest to you the Ancient History, particularly that of Greece. I think Rollin's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010296a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> success might encourage you, nor need you be in the least intimidated by his merit. That author has no other merit but a certain facility and sweetness of narration, but has loaded his work with fifty puerilities.</p><p>Our friend Wedderburn is advancing with great strides in his profession . . . .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010296a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p>I desire my compliments to Lord Elibank. I hope his Lordship has forgot his vow of answering us, and of washing Queen Mary white. <span class="linelast">I am afraid that is impossible; but his Lordship is very well qualified to gild her.</span></p></div>
