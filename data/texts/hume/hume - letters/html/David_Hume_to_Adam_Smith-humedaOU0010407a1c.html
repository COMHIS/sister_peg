	<div id="humedaOU0010407a1c"><p class="salutation">My dear Smith</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have been three days at Paris and two at Fontainbleau; and have every where met with the most extraordinary Honours which the most exorbitant Vanity cou'd wish or desire.</span> The Compliments of Dukes and Marischals of France and foreign Ambassadors go for nothing with me at present: I retain a Relish for no kind of Flattery but that which comes from the Ladies. All the Courtiers, who stood around when I was introduc'd to M<sup>e</sup> de Pompadour,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> assurd me that she was never heard [?] to say so much to any Man; and her Brother, . . . .[words obliterated] But I forget already, that I am to scorn all the Civilities . . . . However, even M<sup>e</sup> Pompadour's Civilities were, if possible, exceeded by those of the Dutchess de Choiseul,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the Wife of the Favourite and prime Minister, and one of the Lady<span class="edComment">[sic]</span> of the most distinguish'd Merit in France. Not contented with the very obliging things she said to me on my first Introduction, she sent to call me from the other End of the Room, in order to repeat them and to enter into a short Conversation with me: And not contented with that, she sent the Danish Ambassador after me to assure me, that what she said was not from Politeness, but that she seriously desir'd to be in Friendship &amp; Correspondence with me. There is not a Courtier in France, who wou'd not have been transported with Joy, to have had the half of these obliging things said to him, by either of these great Ladies; but what may appear more extraordinary, both of them, as far as I could conjecture, have read with some Care all my Writings that have been translated into French, that is, almost all my Writings. The King said nothing particular to me, when I was introducd to him; and (can you imagine it) I was become so silly as to be a little mortify'd by it, till they told me, that he never says any thing to any body, the first time he sees them. The Dauphin,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> as I am told from all hands, declares himself on every Occasion very strongly in my favour; and many people assure me, that I have reason to be proud of his Judgement, even were he an Individual. I have scarce seen any of the Geniuses of Paris, who, I think, have in general great Merit, as Men of Letters. But every body is forward to tell me the high Panegyrics I receive from [them;] and you may believe that . . . .[words obliterated] Approbation which has procur'd me all these Civilities from the Courtiers.</p><p>I know you are ready to ask me, my dear Friend, if all this does not make me very happy: No, I feel little or no Difference. As this is the first Letter I write to my Friends at home, I have amus'd myself (and hope I have amus'd you) by giving you a very abridg'd Account of these Transactions: But can I ever forget, that it is the very same Species, that wou'd scarce show me common Civilities a very few Years ago at Edinburgh, who now receive me with such Applauses at Paris? I assure you I reap more internal Satisfaction from the very amiable Manners &amp; Character of the Family in which I live (I mean Lord &amp; Lady Hertford &amp; Lord Beauchamp) than from all these external Vanities; and it is that domestic Enjoyment which must be considerd as the agreeable Circumstance in my Situation. During the two last days in particular, that I have been at Fontainebleau, I have sufferd (the Expression is not improper) as much Flattery as almost any man has ever done in the same time: But there are few days in my Life, when I have been in good Health, that I would not rather pass over again. Mr Neville,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> our Minister, an honest worthy English Gentleman, who carry'd me about, was astonishd at the Civilities I met with; and has assurd me, that, on his Return, he will not fail to inform the King of England and the English Ministry of all these particulars. But enough of all these Follies. You see I trust to your Friendship, that you will forgive me; and to your Discretion, that you will keep my Secret.</p><p>I had almost forgot in these Effusions, shall I say of my Misanthropy or my Vanity, to mention the Subject which first put my Pen in my hand. The Baron d'Holbac,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> whom I saw at Paris, told me, that there was one under his Eye that was translating your Theory of moral Sentiments;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010407a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> and desird me to inform you of it: Mr Fitzmaurice, your old Friend, interests himself strongly in this Undertaking: Both of them wish to know, if you propose to make any Alterations on the Work, and desire you to inform me of your Intentions in that particular. Please direct to me under Cover to the Earl of Hertford at Northumberland House, London. Letters so directed will be sent to us at Paris. I desire my Compliments to all Friends.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am My Dear Smith Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Fontainebleau</span></span> <span class="date">28 Oct<sup>r</sup> 1763</span></p></div>
