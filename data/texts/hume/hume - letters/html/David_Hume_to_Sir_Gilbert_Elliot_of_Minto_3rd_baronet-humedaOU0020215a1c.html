	<div id="humedaOU0020215a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir Gilbert</p><p><span class="linefirst">After all, the Minister of Roberton<span href="/item/humedaOU0020215a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> is not dead, nor dying, for the present.</span> He had been very ill, and reported to be dead; so that Lord Alemore<span href="/item/humedaOU0020215a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> wrote to his Brother upon that Supposition; and many Applications were made to Lady Elliot for her Interest with you. I must therefore excuse my young Man for being misled; tho the Mistake is very unlucky, in every thing, except that it gives me a new Proof of your Desire to oblige me. I assure you I am very sensible of it. I believe I coud have accommodated matters with Lord Alemore. The Kirk is strictly speaking in the Forrest;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020215a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> but the greatest part of the Parish is in Teviotdale.</p><p>I am glad of your Victories;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020215a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> tho' I look upon them all as temporary and imperfect, like the fallacious Recoveries of a hectic Person who is hastening to his Dissolution. Our Government has become a Chimera; and is too perfect in point of Liberty, for so vile a Beast as an Englishman, who is a Man, a bad Animal too, corrupted by above a Century of Licentiousness. The Misfortune is, that this Liberty can scarcely be retrench'd without Danger of being entirely lost; at least, the fatal Effects of Licentiousness must first be made palpable, by some extreme Mischief, resulting from it. I may wish that the Catastrophe should rather fall on our Posterity; but it hastens on with such large Strides, as leaves little Room for this hope.</p><p>I am running over again the last Edition of my History in order to correct it still farther. I either soften or expunge many villanous seditious Whig Strokes, which had crept into it. I wish that my Indignation at the present Madness, encourag'd by Lyes, Calumnies, Imposture, and every infamous Art usual among popular Leaders, may not throw me into the opposite Extreme. I am, however, sensible that the first Editions were too full of those foolish English Prejudices, which all Nations and all Ages disavow.</p><p>The present firm Conduct of the King, and his manly Resentment, afford some Glimpse of hope. We at a Distance are not acquainted with these matters, and few even at London: But there still appears something mysterious in the Duke of Grafton's Resignation. I hope it proceeded only from his Discontents with Bedford House.</p><p>But I detain you too long. I shall only conclude, that, tho' I reckon myself among the <em>Sepoliti</em>,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020215a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> I cannot forbear expressing my hearty good Wishes to your Cause and you. I am very sincerely Dear Sir Gilbert</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your obligd humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">21 of Feby 1770</span></p></div>
