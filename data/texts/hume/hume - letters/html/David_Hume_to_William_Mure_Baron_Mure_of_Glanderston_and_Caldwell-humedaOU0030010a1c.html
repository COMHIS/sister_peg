	<div id="humedaOU0030010a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">30 June 1743</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I have read Mr Leechman's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030010a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Sermon<span href="/item/humedaOU0030010a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> with a great deal of Pleasure, &amp; think it a very good one; tho' I am sorry to find the Author to be a rank Atheist. You know (or ought to know) that Plato says there are three kinds of Atheists.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030010a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></span> The first who deny a Deity, the second who deny his Providence, the third who assert, that he is influenc'd by Prayers or Sacrifices. I find Mr Leechman is an Atheist of the last kind.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030010a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p><p>I think the Language very correct; tho' there occurd to me a few doubts as I went along, which I shall here mention, that if you or he think them well founded you may make Use of them. I think myself very ill qualify'd to advise Mr Leechman; but as he was once pleas'd to desire my Sentiments, with regard to his Language, I am resolv'd not to lose the Honour of such a Pupil, tho the Subject be but a Trifle &amp; tho I owe that Advantage more to his Modesty than my superior Skill.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030010a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p>P. 5. L. penult. for <em>we do see them approaching us</em>, read <em>we foresee</em> <em>them</em>. P. 6. L. 2 add <em>also</em>. P. 8. L. 12 add <em>that</em> (this is to prevent a <em>construction louche</em>, as the French call it, or a squint ey'd construction. For you may observe, that the Words following viz <em>Acts of Faith</em> may at first be taken for the Accusative of the verb <em>find</em>, whereas they are really the Nominative of the verb <em>are</em>) P. 10. L. 8. <em>Besides, nothing</em> etc. The Parts of this Construction are too remote, &amp; may be corrected either by leaving out a part of the middle, or by recapitulating the beginning, in this manner, <em>Nothing, I say, can be more agreable to this perfect Character, than</em> &amp; c. Id L. 26, For <em>so it should</em>, &amp; c. Read, <em>so is there no reason to suspect</em> &amp; c. (this is to prevent the two Infinitives). P. 13. L. 26 Say, <em>There seem to me two Ends or Designs of Prayer. The first is to express</em> (I do not think the division can be properly made in the Sentence, unless the other member of the Division were to follow in the next Sentence.) The Construction [is] also too wide in this Sentence. P. 15. L. 5. Dele. <em>with ourselves</em>. P. 20. L. 13 for <em>it</em> read <em>that Providence</em>. P. 21. L. ult. add <em>is it supposable I say</em>. P. 24. L. 11 say, <em>yet are sometimes more uniformly</em>. P. 26. L. 11 for <em>of them</em> read <em>of the world</em>. P. 31. L. 22 say <em>nothing defective or blameable</em>. P. 33. L. antepenult dele. <em>one</em>. L. penult. for <em>some</em> read <em>a</em>. L. ult. dele. <em>he had in his view</em>. P. 34. L. 2 say, <em>he resembles a Traveller in a mountanous Countrey, who, this hour, sees nothing beyond a neighbouring Hill, which terminates his View; the top of which he no sooner gains, than a new Extent of Mountains fills</em> &amp; c. (Tho the Simile might be justify'd as it stands, yet it seems defective, in this respect, that it needs to be justify'd.) P. 39. L. 16, say <em>what Ground then is there</em>. P. 50. L. 9. say <em>feel that the Violence of Temptation is abated, that</em> &amp; c. (The Construction of the two parts of the Sentence ought to be similar.) P. 51, L. 19. dele <em>with ourselves</em>. P. 53. L. 25. for <em>who is</em> read <em>that is</em>. P. 55. L. 8 read <em>over us</em>. P. 56. L. 6. for <em>desires</em> read <em>wishes</em>. Id. L. 20 for <em>the like</em> read <em>like</em>. P. 57. L. 8 for <em>this</em> read <em>the</em>.</p><p>These are all the minute Faults I cou'd observe in the Sermon. Mr Leechman has a very clear manly Expression, but in my humble Opinion he does not consult his Ear enough, nor aim at a Style that may be smooth &amp; harmonious; which, next to Perspicuity is the chief Ornament of Style. Vide Cicero, Quinctilian, Longinus &amp; c, &amp; c. If this Sermon were not a popular Discourse, I shoud also think it might be made more concise.</p><p>As to the Argument I cou'd wish Mr. Leechman wou'd in the second Edition answer this Objection both to Devotion &amp; Prayer, &amp; indeed to every thing we commonly call Religion, except the Practice of Morality, &amp; the Assent of the Understanding to the Proposition <em>that God exists</em>.</p><p>It must be acknowledg'd that Nature has given us a strong Passion of Admiration for whatever is excellent, &amp; of Love &amp; Gratitude for whatever is benevolent &amp; beneficial, &amp; that the Deity possesses these Attributes in the highest Perfection &amp; yet I assert he is not the natural Object of any Passion or Affection. He is no Object either of the Senses or Imagination, &amp; very little of the Understanding, without which it is impossible to excite any Affection. A remote Ancestor, who has left us Estates &amp; Honours, acquir'd with Virtue, is a great Benefactor, &amp; yet tis impossible to bear him any Affection, because unknown to us; tho in general we know him to be a Man or a human Creature, which brings him vastly nearer our Comprehension than an invisible infinite Spirit. A man, therefore, may have his Heart perfectly well disposd towards every proper &amp; natural Object of Affection, Friends, Benefactors, Countrey, Children &amp;c, &amp; yet from this Circumstance of the Invisibility &amp; Incomprehensibility of the Deity may feel no Affection towards him. And indeed I am afraid, that all Enthusiasts mightily deceive themselves. Hope &amp; Fear perhaps agitate their Breast when they think of the Deity: Or they degrade him into a Resemblance with themselves, &amp; by that means render him more comprehensible. Or they exult with Vanity in esteeming themselves his peculiar Favourites. Or at best they are actuated by a forc'd &amp; strain'd Affection, which moves by Starts &amp; Bounds, &amp; with a very irregular disorderly Pace. Such an Affection can not be requir'd of any Man as his Duty. Please to observe, that I not only exclude the turbulent Passions, but the calm Affections. Neither of them can operate without the Assistance of the Senses, &amp; Imagination, or at least a more compleat Knowledge of the Object than we have of the Deity. In most Men this is the Case; &amp; a natural Infirmity can never be a Crime. But secondly were Devotion never so much admitted, Prayer must still be excluded. First The Addressing of our virtuous Wishes &amp; Desires to the Deity, since the Address has no Influence on him, is only a kind of rhetorical Figure, in order to render these Wishes more ardent &amp; passionate. This is Mr Leechman's Doctrine. Now the Use of any figure of Speech can never be a Duty. Secondly this Figure, like most Figures of Rhetoric, has an evident Impropriety in it. For we can make use of no Expression or even Thought, in Prayers &amp; Entreaties, which does not imply that these Prayers have an Influence. Thirdly. This Figure is very dangerous &amp; leads directly &amp; even unavoidably to Impiety &amp; Blasphemy. Tis a natural Infirmity of Men to imagine, that their Prayers have a direct Influence, &amp; this Infirmity must be extremely foster'd &amp; encouragd by the constant Use of Prayer. Thus all wise Men have excluded the Use of Images &amp; Pictures in Prayer; tho they certainly enliven Devotion; because tis found by Experience, that with the vulgar these visible Representations draw too much towards them, &amp; become the only Objects of Devotion. <span class="linelast">Excuse this Long Letter, make my Compliments to Mr Leechman &amp; all Friends, &amp; believe me to be Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D.
