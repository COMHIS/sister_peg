	<div id="humedaOU0020105a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">Your Letter gave me a great deal of Uneasyness; by letting me see, that I had, innocently and undesignedly given you Uneasyness.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020105a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> I assure you, that I believe I have made a very trifling Present to Mr Strahan and what will scarce be worth his Acceptance. I fancy, that 500 Copies of the Account of that ridiculous Affair between Rousseau and me will be more than sufficient to satisfy the Curiosity of the Public at London: The Pamphlet will not appear as coming from my hand but as a Translation of the Paris Edition; and as Becket has commonly the first Copies of French Books, it will be thought quite natural to come from his Press If I had imagin'd, that it wou'd have given you the least Satisfaction to be the Publisher, it shoud never had been sent to any other hand.</p><p>I shall endeavour to render the next Edition of my History as correct as possible; tho' I do not expect to see it necessary for several Years.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020105a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Your last Edition was certainly too numerous; but that cannot now be prevented. Mr Bell &amp; Mr Donaldson tell me, that they are quite out of Copies of my philosophical Pieces. The former assurd me that he sold but a few of his Quota at London; the second none at all. But this last, I doubt of a little. I own, that the quick sale of my Philosophy surprizes me as much as the slow sale of my History. You have scarce dispos'd of 2000 Copies in three Years.</p><p>I shall probably do as you advise; and Sketch out the Outlines of the two or three subsequent Reigns, which I may finish at London, after I find, that there remains no farther Obstacles to this Work, and that it is favour'd, I do not say, by every body (for that is impossible) but by the Generality of the World. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Millar.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir <br />Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">8 of Oct<sup>r</sup> 1766<span href="/item/humedaOU0020105a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S.</p><p>Dr Robertson talks of being ready Winter after this.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020105a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> He is just now finishing an Introduction.</p></div></div>
