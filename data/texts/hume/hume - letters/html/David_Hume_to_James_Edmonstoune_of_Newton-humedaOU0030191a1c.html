Not but dissolute People are a proper Object of Compassion; but no Assistance or Relief does them any Service. However, I keep your Guinea, till I shall see her Sister, who comes here sometimes, and whom I shall desire to send your former Maid to profit by your Generosity: At least, I keep it, till I shall see you. But why is that so seldom? Why do you never come to Town? What are you employ'd about, farming, reading, procreating, or nothing at all? I am very sorry to hear you mention your bad State of Health: Were I not occupyd very much in building,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030191a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I shoud have attended Baron Mure, and rejoicd at your Fire Side. My Compliments to Mrs Edmondestone; and believe me to be with great Sincerity.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your affectionate humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">17 of March 1771</span></p></div>
