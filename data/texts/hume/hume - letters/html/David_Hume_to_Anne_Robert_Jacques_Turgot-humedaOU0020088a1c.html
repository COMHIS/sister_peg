Rousseau is a Madman and I shall add, if you please, that he always was so; but this will, by no means, excuse him, or save him from more black Imputations.</span> On the contrary it is by means of his Madness that his other bad Qualities appear in their full Light, and perhaps become more dangerous on that account and can less be guarded against. For Instance What can be more blameable than his Conduct with regard to M. Dalembert? There was no manner of Connexion, which led from M. Walpole to him; and Rousseau was only carry'd to suspect him as an Accomplice in that Piece of Pleasantry, on account of his own Rage and Malignity against him. But on what was this Malignity founded? Plainly on nothing, as he himself, in a manner confesses, but because d'Alembert did not pay him a Visit when he was at Paris. The Truth is: d'Alembert intended to have waited on him, but I innocently prevented him by telling him, that Rousseau complained so bitterly of being harrassed with Company, that I thought it better to let him alone. Think then of the Atrocity of that Man's Mind, who could treasure up such a Stock of Malice from so slight an Offence; and think of his Falshood and Quackery in continually pretending to fly into Solitude while he is watching with the most anxious Sollicitude, the Honour of Visits, and resenting the smallest Neglects of this kind.</p><p>But the extreme Depravity of his Heart appears the more strongly in his Conduct towards me: For not only there was not the smallest Chain that led from Mr Walpole to me, not the smallest Thread, not the smallest Hair; but there was an infinite reason to exempt me from all Suspicion: What then induced him to suspect me? His Rage and Malignity against me. And on what founded? It is needless to explain it. He has said to M. Duclos, to Baron d'Holback and to many others as I am now certainly informed, that he hates all those to whom he owes Obligations, and surely, in this Light, I was fully entitled to his Hatred. But, I ask, was such a Perversity of Mind ever before known in any human or indeed in any animal Being? A Tyger or a Hyæna, if you feed him in his Den, will abate of his Fury while you approach him; and will lick the beneficent hand which nourishes and caresses him. But this Prodigy of Pride and Ferocity interprets every Favour into an Injury, and meditates your Ruin even while you are serving him with the greatest Zeal and Industry. It is no Apology to say that his Madness made him believe me guilty of a Confederacy with Mr Walpole against him. He himself pretends not the smallest Reason for believing it. He had no such Indication; he had no such Information; even amidst his greatest Folly he hesitates and scruples to affirm it: He has only, as he confesses, an internal Conviction of it. That is his Rage against me suggested such an Opinion. For the Passion plainly arose not from the Opinion, but produced it.</p><p>Consider also, Dear Sir, the other Scene which opens at the same time. You now see, that, even while we were living together in seeming Intimacy, his Heart, amidst all his Caresses and Professions of Fondness was full of Malignity against me; and he was watching every Look and Gesture and Accent, not to say, Word and Sentence, whether I was sleeping or awake, in order to put a malicious Interpretation upon them. Judge of the Innocence of my Conduct, when, in three Months' Intercourse, he cou'd, properly speaking, find nothing but an Excess in Civility and Attention to object.</p><p>I hope also, you will not forget the palpable and absurd Lyes with which he interlards his Invective against me. He was sensible, mad as he is, that, if we had so long lived together in Friendship and had parted amicably, it was absurd in him, while dwelling in the Mountains of Derbyshire, to burst into Rage against an absent Person who was continually employ'd in his Service and against whom he could not bring the smallest Shadow of Evidence. He pretends therefore, very cunningly (for nothing so cunning as a Madman) that he had formerly reproached me with Perfidy, and that I had not attempted to justify myself. But happily, this Lye is refuted, as well by his own Letters, as by the whole Tenor of my Conduct. For surely, I shoud never have given myself so much Trouble to serve a Man who had thrown out such an absurd Suspicion against me. I omit the other numerous Falshoods contained in his Letter.</p><p>It is needless, by vain Rhetoric, especially to you, to aggravate the Atrocity of deliberate Lyes and Calumnies, or to remark how much this Guilt, already great, may be augmented by particular Connexions with the Person who is attacked by these poysoned Weapons. Were you a less zealous Friend of this Man, I shoud only desire you to divert yourself on this Occasion with the Magnificence and Ostentation of his usual Pretentions on the head of Veracity, and compare them to his Practice. You know, that he has even engraved a Seal with this Motto 'Vitam impendere vero' and that he never seals any Letter, not even those to me with any other Device. The Life of such a Man is to be regarded as one continu'd Lye and Imposture.</p><p>You say indeed, that he cannot properly deserve the severe Epithets with which I have honoured him; because it is probable that he had not calmly formed the deliberate Purpose of quarrelling with me and calumniating me: He was only actuated by the Sourness and Melancholy of his Temper. Add, by the Pride and Malignity of his Heart: Add, that he sacrifices every regard to Truth and Honour, in order to gratify his Malice; add, that his Ferocity is directed not only against a Man who is his Benefactor, but because he is so; all Villains are not calm ones: Catiline and Caligula and Nero were not the Men of the coolest Dispositions in the World.</p><p>You see, therefore, that I am far from pleading, as an Apology for my Letter to Baron d'Holbach the natural Vivacity of a first Movement, on receiving such violent Outrage from Rousseau in return for so many Favours. I really believe him one of the worst and most depraved of Men; and tho' his Conduct towards many others besides me will justify this Opinion; it is needless for me to go any farther than myself. The only Apology, which any part of my Conduct requires is, my engaging so far in Friendship with a Man who was in a manner personally unknown to me. But I was acquainted with his Genius and his Misfortunes, and besides his applying to me himself, he was put into my hands by those in Paris, with whom I lived in great Intimacy, and to whose Civilities I had been extremely beholden. Tho' some prudent Persons gave me Warning of his black and dangerous Character, I was still inclined rather to believe those who spoke favourably of him; and while we lived together, his Behaviour was such as gave me no reason to repent it. I contracted a real Affection and Friendship for him; and endless is the Raillery which I now sustain from my Acquaintance, on account of what I said and wrote in his Favour. But I shall never be much ashamed of Mistakes of this Nature.</p><p>I wonder you shou'd regard the breaking out of this Affair as a Misfortune. I think rather that nothing can be more fortunate than the Detection of such a Mountebank: For I am willing to soften my Epithets, in Complaisance to you. I wish, that all other Cheats and Impostors in all Professions were as fairly exposed. You know, that I always esteemed his Writings for their Eloquence alone and that I looked on them, at the bottom, as full of Extravagance and of Sophystry. I found many good Judges in France and all in England, of a like Opinion. Is there any Harm that the Public in general shou'd adopt the same Sentiments, and shou'd appreciate at their just Value Compositions whose general Tendency is surely rather to do hurt than Service to Mankind?</p><p>You judge Mr Walpole with great Severity when you blame his Pleasantry against Rousseau. Is every Epigram or Stroke of Satyre against an Author so great a Crime? On the contrary it seems to me that Authors alone or such as exhibit themselves on the public Stage of the World are fairly exposed to those Darts and must expect Applause or Hisses, according to their own Merit or the Humour of their Audience. In vain you say that Mr Walpole's Pleasantry was the Cause of all this Mischief. I see little Mischief, except to those who deserve it. And it was quite necessary that Rousseau's secret Rage against d'Alembert and me shou'd burst out on some Occasion or other. Indeed, it was not easy for him to find a less favourable Occasion or less plausible Pretence, than that which he has laid hold of; besides, I beg you to consider, that Mr Walpole never intended to publish that Piece of Pleasantry, and that a Copy of it was stolen from him.</p><p>But, My Dear Sir, at the same time, that I cannot forbear wondering at your great Partiality in favour of Rousseau, I acknowledge, with the most lively Sense, your Candour and Friendship towards me, in delivering it as your Opinion that it will be necessary to publish for my own Vindication, the whole Train of Correspondence between us. I have heard of the Challenges and Defiances thrown out in several of his Letters; and these have been so publicly handed about that Translations of two of them have already got into the English News papers. It is with the utmost Reluctance, I own that I shall proceed to this Extremity; and herein consists the only real Injury, that this Man has been able to do me. I may boast, that, among all the Authors now alive, I am, perhaps, the most remarkable, for my continued and uninterrupted Love of Peace; and no Provocation has yet been able to engage me in any Controversy either personal or literary. I cou'd cover the Floor of a large Room with Books and Pamphlets wrote against me, to none of which I ever made the least Reply, not from Disdain (for the Authors of some of them, I respect) but from my Desire of Ease and Tranquillity. There is a Prelate,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020088a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> in England, noted for his illiberal Insolence and Scurrility, who has also formed a Confederacy of Authors, as remarkable for these Qualities, as any School of Painters ever was for their peculiar Style and Manner. The Master and the Scholars have all of them successively honoured me with their Insults and Outrages. I never gave them the least Sign of Life: But this Silence, I own, proceeded as much from Disdain as from my Love of Peace; and I pretend not to make a Merit of it.</p><p>If I be at last obliged to publish my own Vindication in this Affair (which indeed will consist of little more than my Adversary's Accusation) I shall reap this Advantage, that I shall be ever after secure from any Calumny, that he may be tempted to throw out against me. Dead or alive, his Testimony will never have any Authority to defame me. I own, that this Consideration chiefly induced me to inform my Friends, both in London and Paris, of my Rupture with Rousseau, and diverted me from that Secrecy which I intended at first to have kept with regard to it. I knew, that he, and even perhaps the World, might regard this Silence as a Presumption of Guilt, and that nothing cou'd more carry the Face of Innocence than an open Indignation at this Treatment which I had met with. You say, that the Letter, which, at that Moment, I wrote to Baron d'Holbach, was not sufficiently moderate: but, besides that it was only a private Letter, tho' not wrote with any View of Secrecy, I think I have fully vindicated it at present and shown my Imputations to be well founded. It cannot surely be interpreted as Want of Temper if, at any time, but much more in the first Movement of Surprize and Indignation, I bestow on a Man the same Epithet, which, upon mature Deliberation, he had to my Face and without any Provocation, thrown on me, after receiving from me the strongest Proofs of Friendship and Attachment.</p><p><em>But his letter to me did me no hurt, and my Complaints against him have done him an irreparable damage in his Character</em>. To this I reply that the Case is similar as if an Assassin had fired a Pistol at me, and missed me; while I, to prevent his firing another Pistol, run him thro the Body. It is always happy when the harm falls on the first Aggressor.</p><p>We are told that Sophocles in his old Age was supposed to have lost his Senses; and his Family for that Reason apply'd for a Commission of Lunacy against him. But the Poet, as his only Answer, read some Scenes of his Tragedy of Œdipus Colonnus which he was at that time composing. And he was unanimously acquitted by the Judges. The Public will probably have soon an Opportunity of giving a Verdict of a like kind with regard to Rousseau. When he publishes what he has composed since his Arrival in England, I dare venture to prophesy that he will be found as much in his Senses as ever he was in his life, and no-one, at least, will say, that, if his Heart was not depraved, he wants Understanding sufficient to conduct him in the ordinary Offices of Life.</p><p>But I am heartily tired of this Subject, as you very well conjecture; and I shall here take my Leave of it, I hope for ever. Tho' you must be tired too of my Letter, I am tempted to say a Word to the political Question, which has been often agitated between us, viz the Method of laying on Taxes, Whether it is better to impose them on landed Possessions or on Consumptions. You will own, that, as the public Revenue is employ'd for the Defence of the whole Community, it is more equitable to levy it from the whole; but you say, that this is impracticable: It will fall on the Land at last; and it is better to lay it on there directly. You suppose then that the Labourers always raise the Price of their Labour in proportion to the Taxes. But this is contrary to Experience. Labour is dearer in Neuf-chatel and other parts of Swisserland, where there are no Taxes, than in the neighbouring Provinces of France, where there are a great many. There are almost no Taxes on the English Colonies; yet Labour is three times dearer there than in any Country of Europe. There are great Taxes on Consumptions in Holland, but the Republic possesses no Land, on which they can fall. The Price of Labour will always depend on the Quantity of Labour and the Quantity of Demand; not on the Taxes. The Tradesmen who work in Cloath, that is exported, cannot raise the Price of their Labour; because in that Case the Price of the Cloath wou'd become too dear to be sold in foreign Markets: Neither can the Tradesmen who work in Cloath for home Consumption raise their Prices; since there cannot be two Prices for the same Species of Labour. This extends to all Commodities of which there is any part exported, that is, to almost every Commodity. Even were there some Commodities of which no part is exported, the Price of Labour employ'd in them, cou'd not rise; for this high Price wou'd tempt so many hands to go into that Species of Industry as must immediatly bring down the Prices. It appears to me that where a Tax is laid on Consumption, the immediate Consequence is that either the Tradesmen consume less or work more. No Man is so industrious but he may add some Hours more in the Week to his Labour: And scarce any one is so poor but he can retrench something of his Expence. What happens when the Corn rises in its Prices? Do not the poor both live worse and labour more? A Tax has the same effect. I beg you also to consider, that, besides the Proprietors of Land and the labouring Poor, there is in every civilized Community a very large and a very opulent Body who employ their Stocks in Commerce and who enjoy a great Revenue from their giving Labour to the poorer sort. I am perswaded that in France and England the Revenue of this kind is much greater than that which arises from Land: For besides Merchants, properly speaking, I comprehend in this Class all Shop-Keepers and Master-Tradesmen of every Species. Now it is very just, that these shoud pay for the Support of the Community, which can only be where Taxes are lay'd on Consumptions. There seems to me no Pretence for saying that this order of Men are necessitated to throw their Taxes on the Proprietors of Land, since their Profits and Income can surely bear Retrenchment.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020088a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> After so long a Letter, you will surely excuse my concluding without any Ceremony or Compliment. <span class="linelast">Be only assured that no Man puts a higher and juster Value on your Friendship than I do.</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
