	<div id="humedaOU0020217b1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Strahan</p><p><span class="linefirst">Tho‘ I have renouncd the World, I cannot forbear being rouzd with Indignation at the Audaciousness, Impudence, and Wickedness of your City Address.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> To punish it as it deserves woud certainly produce a Fray; but what signifies a Fray, in comparison of losing all Authority to Government. There must necessarily be a Struggle between the Mob and the Constitution; and it cannot come on at a more favourable time nor in a more favourable Cause. I wish therefore, (I cannot say I hope) that vigorous Measures will be taken; an impeachment immediately voted of the Mayor and his two Sherriffs for high Crimes and Misdemeanours, and the Habeas Corpus suspended till next meeting of Parliament. Good God! what abandon'd Madmen there are in England!</p><p>You have suspended my Chronicle on account of Sir Gilbert's vacating his seat.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I am of a Club here that get down News papers and Pamphlets from London regularly: So that you wont need to send me the Chronicle any more. Please only to let me know the Charge of it, together with other Articles I owe you.</p><p>I am sorry to hear that Dr Armstrong has printed his Tragedy<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> among his Miscellanies. It is certainly one of the worst pieces I ever saw; and totally unworthy of his other Productions. I shoud have endeavourd to dissuade him from printing it, had he been a man advisable. But I knew, that he keeps an Anger against Garrick for above twenty Years for refusing to bring it on the Stage; and he never since woud allow him to be so much as a tolerable Actor. I thought therefore it was wiser not to meddle in the Affair.</p><p>I have had a Letter from Mr Cadell, which is very obliging: I agree to the reprinting in any form you and he please, and I believe ten volumes in large Octavo will be best.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> But I find, that I have been cutting a great way before the point, and that I am scarce ever likely to see an End of that detestable Edition.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> I really have no reason to believe seriously, that the half of it is yet sold, or that the Book has at present any sale at all worth speaking of: Such a habit you and he have got during seven Years past of deceiving me by false Intelligence, that I am determind never to believe a word either of you says on that head.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020217b1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> For Instance you both told me when I left London, that there remaind not 700 Copies: He has since wrote me that before the meeting of Parliament he had disposd of 200 of these: In his last Letter he says, that the Sale still continues rapid. I must therefore suppose that before the month of May next, there would not be 300 in your Warehouses, which is a little enough Number (or too little) for a Book which woud take near a twelvemonth in reprinting. But he speaks still of a distant Period for beginning the new Edition. You see, therefore, that these Stories are totally inconsistent. I need only say, that I have a Copy corrected, and I believe considerably improvd at your Service, whenever you please to call for it. I am nowise impatient to have another Edition: I only show you that I had taken my Measures, in consequence of the Intelligence conveyd to me; and I shall add, that, if the Book has really any Sale, it woud probably be the Interest of the Proprietors to run the Risque of losing some of that odious Edition rather than encumber the Market any longer with it. But of this you are the best Judges.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Strahan Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">13 of March 1770</span></p></div>
