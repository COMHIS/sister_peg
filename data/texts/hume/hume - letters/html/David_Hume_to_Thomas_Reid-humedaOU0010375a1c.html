To this reason, chiefly, I ascribe some obscurities, which, in spite of your short analysis or abstract, still seem to hang over your system. For I must do you the justice to own, that when I enter into your ideas, no man appears to express himself with greater perspicuity than you do; a talent which, above all others, is requisite in that species of literature which you have cultivated. There are some objections, which I would willingly propose, to the chapter 'Of Sight,' did I not suspect that they proceed from my not sufficiently understanding it; and I am the more confirmed in this suspicion, as Dr Blair tells me, that the former objections I made, had been derived chiefly from that cause. I shall therefore forbear till the whole can be before me, and shall not at present propose any farther difficulties to your reasonings. I shall only say, that if you have been able to clear up these abstruse and important subjects, instead of being mortified, I shall be so vain as to pretend to a share of the praise; and shall think that my errors, by having at least some coherence, had led you to make a more strict review of my principles, which were the common ones, and to perceive their futility.</p><p>As I was desirous to be of some use to you, I kept a watchful eye all along over your style; but it is really so correct, and so good English, that I found not any thing worth the remarking. There is only one passage in this chapter, where you make use of the phrase, <em>hinder to do</em>, instead of <em>hinder from doing</em>, which is the English one; but I could not find the passage when I sought for it. You may judge how unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark so small a blemish. <span class="linelast">I beg my compliments to my friendly adversaries, Dr Campbell<span href="/item/humedaOU0010375a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and Dr Gerard,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010375a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and also to Dr Gregory,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010375a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> whom I suspect to be of the same disposition, tho he has not openly declared himself such.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010375a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></span></p></div>
