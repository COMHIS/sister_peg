	<div id="humedaOU0010164a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">February 4<sup>th</sup>, 1752.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have been ready to burst with vanity and self-conceit this week past; and being obliged from decorum to keep a strict watch over myself, and check all eruptions of that kind, I really begin to find my health impaired by it, and perceive that there is an absolute necessity for breathing a vein, and giving a loose to my inclination.</span> You shall therefore be my physician, Dum podagricus fit pugil et medicum urget.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> You must sustain the overflowings of my pride; and I expect, too, that by a little flattery you are to help Nature in her discharge, and draw forth a still greater flux of the peccant matter. 'Tis not on my account alone you are to take part in this great event; philosophy, letters, science, virtue, triumph along with me, and have now in this one singular instance, brought over even the people from the side of bigotry and superstition.</p><p>This is a very pompous exordium, you say; but what will you say when I tell you that all this is occasioned by my obtaining a petty office of forty or fifty guineas a year. Since Caligula of lunatic memory, who triumphed on account of the cockle shells which he gathered on the sea shore, no one has ever erected a trophy for so small an advantage. But judge not by appearances! Perhaps you will think, when you know all the circumstances, that this success is both as extraordinary in itself, and as advantageous to me, as any thing which could possibly have happened.</p><p>You have probably heard that my friends in Glasgow, contrary to my opinion and advice, undertook to get me elected into that College; and they had succeeded, in spite of the violent and solemn remonstrances of the clergy, if the Duke of Argyle<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> had had courage to give me the least countenance. Immediately upon the back of this failure, which should have blasted for some time all my pretensions, the office of library-keeper to the Faculty of Advocates fell vacant,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> a genteel office, though of small revenue; and as this happened suddenly, my name was immediately set up by my friends without my knowledge. The President,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and the Dean of Faculty his son,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> who used to rule absolutely in this body of advocates, formed an aversion to the project, because it had not come from them; and they secretly engaged the whole party called Squadrone<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> against me. The bigots joined them, and both together set up a gentleman of character, and an advocate, and who had great favour on both these accounts.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> The violent cry of Deism, atheism, and scepticism, was raised against me; and 'twas represented that my election would be giving the sanction of the greatest and most learned body of men in this country to my profane and irreligious principles. But what was more dangerous, my opponents entered into a regular concert and cabal against me; while my friends were contented to speak well of their project in general, without having once formed a regular list of the electors, or considered of the proper methods of engaging them. Things went on in this negligent manner till within six days of the election, when they met together and found themselves in some danger of being outnumbered; immediately upon which they raised the cry of indignation against the opposite party; and the public joined them so heartily, that our antagonists durst show their heads in no companies nor assemblies: expresses were despatched to the country, assistance flocked to us from all quarters, and I carried the election by a considerable majority, to the great joy of all bystanders.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> When faction and party enter into a cause, the smallest trifle becomes important. Nothing since the Rebellion has ever so much engaged the attention of this town, except Provost Stewart's trial;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> and there scarce is a man whose friendship or acquaintance I would desire, who has not given me undoubted proofs of his concern and regard.</p><p>What is more extraordinary, the cry of religion could not hinder the ladies from being violently my partisans, and I owe my success in a great measure to their solicitations. One has broke off all commerce with her lover, because he voted against me! and Mr Lockhart,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> in a speech to the Faculty, said there was no walking the streets, nor even enjoying one's own fireside, on account of their importunate zeal. The town says, that even his bed was not safe for him, though his wife was cousin-german to my antagonist.</p><p>'Twas vulgarly given out, that the contest was betwixt Deists and Christians; and when the news of my success came to the play-house, the whisper ran that the Christians were defeated. Are you not surprised that we could keep our popularity, notwithstanding this imputation, which my friends could not deny to be well founded?</p><p>The whole body of cadies<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> brought flambeaux, and made illuminations to mark their pleasure at my success; and next morning I had the drums and town music at my door, to express their joy, as they said, of my being made a great man. They could not imagine, that so great a fray could be raised about so mere a trifle.</p><p>About a fortnight before, I had published a Discourse of the Protestant Succession,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> wherein I had very liberally abused both Whigs and Tories; yet I enjoyed the favour of both parties.</p><p>Such, dear Doctor, is the triumph of your friend; yet, amidst all this greatness and glory, even though master of 30,000 volumes, and possessing the smiles of a hundred fair ones, in this very pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity, I cast a favourable regard on you, and earnestly desire your friendship and good-will: a little flattery too, from so eminent a hand, would be very acceptable to me. You know you are somewhat in my debt, in that particular. The present I made you of my <em>Enquiry</em>,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> was calculated both as a mark of my regard, and as a snare to catch a little incense from you. Why do you put me to the necessity of giving it to myself?</p><p>Please tell General St Clair, that Mr St Clair,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span> the advocate, voted for me on his account; but his nephew, Sir David,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010164a1c/nts/015" title="15 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">15</span> was so excessively holy, that nothing could bring him over from the opposite party, for which he is looked down upon a little by the fashionable company in town. But he is a very pretty fellow, and will soon regain the little ground he has lost.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Doctor, yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
