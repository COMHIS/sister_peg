	<div id="humedaOU0030028a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">After I had the Pleasure of seeing you, I took a Resolution of printing the Papers you was so good as to peruse, along with some others, under the general Title of <em>Political Discourses</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030028a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></span> They are twelve in Number, &amp; the Subjects are <em>Of Commerce, of Luxury, of Money, of Interest, of the Ballance of Trade, of the Ballance</em> <em>of Power, of Taxes, of public Credit, of some remarkable Customs, of the Populousness of Antient Nations, of the Protestant Succession, an Idea of a perfect Commonwealth</em>.</p><p>Before that on the Populousness of antient Nations I intend to prefix a Note<span href="/item/humedaOU0030028a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> to the following Purpose. 'An eminent Clergyman in Edinburgh having wrote, some Years ago,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030028a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> a Discourse on the same Question with this of the Populousness of antient Nations, was pleas'd lately to communicate it to the Author. It maintaind the opposite Side of the Argument to what is here insisted on, &amp; contain'd much Erudition &amp; good Reasoning. The Author acknowledges to have borrow'd, with some Variations, from that Discourse two Computations <em>viz</em> that with regard to the Number of Inhabitants in <em>Epirus</em>, and that with regard to those in <em>Belgium</em>. If this learned Gentleman be prevail'd on to publish his Dissertation, it will serve to give great Light into the present Question, the most curious &amp; important of all Questions of Erudition.'</p><p>This Note, however unexceptionable it may seem to me, I woud not venture to print without your Consent; as not knowing how you might relish it. I hope it will give Offence to no Body, that you &amp; I have a Correspondence together on literary Subjects.</p><p>There has been printed at London, but not yet publish'd an <em>Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0030028a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> of which I have order'd a Copy to be sent you; I hope you will not find my Ethics liable to much Exception, on the Side of Orthodoxy, whatever they may on the Side of Argument &amp; Philosophy.</p><p>Please direct to me at this Place under Cover to Will.
