	<div id="humedaOU0010178a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am to give you great and very hearty thanks for your care in providing for my cousin<span href="/item/humedaOU0010178a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> at my desire.</span> The quickness in doing it, and the many obliging circumstances attending that good office, I shall not readily forget. What is usual, they say, makes little impression; but that this rule admits of exceptions, I feel upon every instance of your friendship.</p><p>Mr Mure told me that you had undertaken to get satisfaction with regard to the <em>old English subsidies</em>. I cannot satisfy myself on that head; but I find that all historians and antiquarians are as much at a loss. The nobility, I observe, paid according to their rank and quality, not their estates. The counties were subjected to no valuation, but it was in the power of the commissioners to sink the sums demanded upon every individual, without raising it upon others; and they practised this art when discontented with the Court, as Charles complains of with regard to the subsidies voted by his third Parliament: Yet it seems certain that there must have been some rule of estimation. What was it? Why was it so variable? Lord Strafford raised an Irish subsidy from £12,000 to £40,000, by changing [the] rule of valuation; but the Irish Parliament, after his impeachment, brought it down again. If Mr Harding<span href="/item/humedaOU0010178a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> undertakes the solution of this matter, it will be requisite to have these difficulties in his eye. I am glad to hear that we are to have your company here this year, and that I shall have an opportunity of talking over this, and many other subjects, where I want your advice and opinion. The more I advance in my undertaking, the more am I convinced that the History of England has never yet been written, not only for style, which is notorious to all the world, but also for matter; such is the ignorance and partiality of all our historians. Rapin, whom I had an esteem for, is totally despicable. I may be liable to the reproach of ignorance, but I am certain of escaping that of partiality: The truth is, there is so much reason to blame and praise alternately King and Parliament, that I am afraid the mixture of both in my composition, being so equal, may pass sometimes for an affectation, and not the result of judgement and evidence. Of this you shall be judge; for I am resolved to encroach on your leisure and patience; Quem vero arripuit, tenet occiditque legendo.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010178a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p>Let me hear of you as you pass through the town, that we may concert measures for my catching you idle, and without company, at Kirkaldy. I am Dear Sir <span class="linelast">Yours affectionately</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Jack's Land.</span> <span class="date">28th June, 1753.</span></p></div>
