Surely there must have been some excessive great mistakes. It appears to me an heap of confusion of which I can make neither head nor tail; his letter to you is perfectly astonishing, never any thing was, so furious, so — I protest I dont know what to call it. I long to see him. He certainly will tell some reason or other that could induce him to write in that manner. Till I have seen him I can give no sort of answers to your Queries, as he never spoke one syllable to me about any differences at all. I cant possibly before Saturdays post, as in this part of the country we have only 3 days in a week to send letters to Town. You desired me to burn the duplicate after reading. That signifys nothing, for I can send you the other which I received yesterday from Wootton — Good God he must be most excessively out of the way about this pension. In short I have not patience to add one word more, till I hear what he can possibly have to say; &amp; then I'll immediately acquaint you.</p><p>I directly gave orders for the plough, which will very soon be made, as tis quite simple, &amp; not more work in it than a common one.</p><p>I cant help being troubled at seeing your Uneasiness &amp; will with great pleasure do all in my power to assist in freeing you from it, at least I'll do my best endeavours.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am your most obedient Humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Rich. Davenport</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Davenport</span> <span class="date">Monday. June 30, 1766.</span></p></div>
