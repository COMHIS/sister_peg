	<div id="humedaOU0020247a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have now the Prospect of being settled, so as to be able to attend the Correction of the Proof Sheets.</span> If you can, therefore, contrive to send me one which will arrive on Saturday Sennight the 31 of August, you shall have it returnd by Course of Post; and I shall never after fail to return one every post, which will be five times a week. I am oblig'd to you for humouring me in this particular.</p><p>I have receiv'd a Present of a new Book, from the Author, <em>The Principles of penal Law</em>. The Direction of it seems to be writ in your hand; and Cadel is one of the Publishers. If the Author does not propose to keep his Name a Secret, I shoud be glad to know it:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020247a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> For the Book is very ingenious and judicious. In all cases, if you know the Author, make him my Compliments and give him my Thanks. I did not imagine, however, that so ingenious a Man woud in this age have had so much weak Superstition, as appears in many passages. But these perhaps were inserted only from Decency and Prudence: And so the World goes on, in perpetually deceiving themselves and one another.</p><p>I am always oblig'd to you for your political Speculations: But I cannot agree with you, that, if matters came to a fair and open Strugle between the Land-holders and the Stock-holders, the latter woud be able to reduce the former to any Composition.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020247a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> The Authority of the Land-holders is solidly establishd over their Tenants and Neighbours: But what Stock-holder has any Influence even over his next Neighbour in his own Street? And if public Credit fall, as it must by the least Touch, he woud be reduc'd to instant Poverty, and have authority nowhere. My only apprehensions are, with regard to the public, that this open Struggle will never happen, and that these two Orders of Men are so involvd with each other by Connexions and Interest, that the public Force will be allowd to go to total Decay, before the violent Remedy, which is the only one, will be ventur'd on. But this Event will depend much on Accidents of Men and times; and the Decision will not probably be very distant: The first War will put the Matter to a tryal, I fancy about the third or fourth Year of it, if we exert ourselves with our usual Frenzy. You may judge, from our late Treatment of the House of Bourbon, whether we can regard the present Peace as very durable.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <br /> <span class="date">19<sup>th</sup> of Aug<sup>t</sup> 1771</span></p></div>
