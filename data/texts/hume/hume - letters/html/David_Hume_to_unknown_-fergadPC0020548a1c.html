I have heard that my Friend, M<sup>r</sup> Ferguson, has been recommended to you as the most proper Person to be appointed Secretary to the Commission of Supervisors for the East Indies; and that, from his general good Character, you were much inclin'd to favour him.</p><p>I have liv'd in the greatest Intimacy with M<sup>r</sup> Ferguson for above twenty years; and tho' I admir'd very much the Beauty of his Genius, known to all the World from his Writings; I assure you, that his Probity, Integrity, and Greatness of Mind, which are also known to everybody in this Country, have always been the chief Foundation of the Esteem which I bore him. I do not more than repeat to you the general Voice, not only of all his Acquaintance but of the Public; and I have the Satisfaction to find that my great affection to him has not render'd me partial in this particular. <span class="linelast">As far, therefore, as my Testimony can have any Weight with you, or as far as the public Opinion, which in these Matters ought to have great Weight with every body, I may venture to say, that Mr Ferguson will be recommended as the Person the most proper for this Trust, that cou'd possibly have been pitch'd on.<span href="/item/fergadPC0020548a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span></p><p class="signoff">I am with great Regard Dear Sir your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
