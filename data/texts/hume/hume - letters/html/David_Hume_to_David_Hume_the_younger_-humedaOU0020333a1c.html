I shall probably have more warning; in which case I shall not fail to summon you; and I shall never dye in Satisfaction, without embracing you. I doubt not but my Name woud have procured you Friends and Credit, in the Course of your Life, especially if my Brother had allwd you to carry it: For who will know it, in the present Disguise?<span href="/item/humedaOU0020333a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> But as he is totally obstinate on this head, I believe we had better let him alone. I have frequently told him, that it is lucky for him he sees few things in a wrong Light; for where he does he is totally incurable.
