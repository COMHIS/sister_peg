	<div id="humedaOU0020337a1c"><p><span class="linefirst">During the hurry of your Business, while the Parliament was sitting, I forbore giving you or Ld North any trouble: But at present, while you may have a little more Leizure, I hope you will excuse my putting you in mind of that Note, which you wrote me by the Duke of Graftons Direction, and of which I use the Freedom of enclosing you a Copy.</span> You then said, that the Duke woud recommend me to his Successor; but perhaps it has been forgot during the Tumult of Business which ensud upon his Grace's Resignation. I hope you will be so good as to lay my Case before Lord North who will be pleasd to consider the Circumstances of my Claim. I resign myself entirely to his Lordship's Wisdom, and shall hold this Office,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020337a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> if it fall vacant, from his Favour, without making any new Applications either to the Duke of Grafton or Lord Hertford or Mr Conway. I am fully sensible of their Goodness to me; but Sollicitations of every kind, I have ever carefully avoided, even when the State of my Fortune seemd more to warrant them than at present.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Perhaps, some Office of an equivalent Value may fall vacant in this Country; and as my receiving it woud be a saving to the civil List, I hope that his Lordship woud admit my Application with Indulgence and not consider it as any Impropriety.</span></p></div>
