I must beg of you to inform me in a few Lines of the Truth; and also whether you intend to give these Papers to the Public. Perhaps, as Charles was at that time very much straitend for Money, and was really ill usd by the Parliament in point of Revenue, he might borrow some Money from Lewis, and repay it afterwards from parliamentary Grants. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Douglas: I say nothing to Mr Pulteney<span href="/item/humedaOU0020226a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> because I will have no Intercourse with Wilkites. Good God! how can a man degrade himself to that degree? But I beg my humble Respects to Mrs Pulteney: I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh.</span></span> <span class="date">16 of June 1770</span></p></div>
