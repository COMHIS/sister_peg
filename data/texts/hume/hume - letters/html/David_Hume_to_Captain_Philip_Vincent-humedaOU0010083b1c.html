Much less does he desire, that I shou'd leave him, and another be sought in my place; since it is your declar'd intention, by what you wrote us both, some time ago, that he shou'd not be without a friend or companion. He says, besides, that there was not a word of my name in the message he sent you, and from which you have taken occasion to write me this letter. I know not how to act amidst all these contrarieties and irresolutions. I am, &amp;c.</p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S. I have shown this letter to my Lord, who says it is quite conformable to his intentions.</p></div></div>
