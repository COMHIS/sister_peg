	<div id="humedaOU0030213b1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have been constantly at this place ever since I did my self the pleasure of writing my last letter to you, in which I said I should leave Wootton in three or four days.</span> The rains have continued from that time to this, which have kept me every day at home. Mr. Rousseau is at Wootton &amp; I purpose going over to see him as soon as the weather settles. What you Observe of him is certainly very true. His refusal amaz'd me; but hope the letter you have sent will have the Effect, your goodness &amp; care for his interest desires it should have. His heart is good &amp; tender, but his sensibility too exquisite. As he never spoke to me upon the Subject of the Pension, I can't imagine what his thoughts are. But if I may venture to Guess, it seems as if he thought it not right, after having refus'd it from one King, to accept it from another. He is I am sure busy in writing, &amp; it should be some large affair, by the quantity of Paper he bought. His health is but precarious &amp; the frequent returns of his disorder must make his temper sometimes uneven.</p><p>You must not forget your promise of letting me have the honor of your Company as you pass this way. The Effects of my plough are visible with a witness — that land done with it a year &amp; half ago, is six times as good as it was before that operation.</p><p>I shall long to hear Mr. R. has changd his mind. Perhaps when I see him he'll tell me, for in most things he is quite communicative. <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Your most oblidged &amp; Obedient Humble Servant.</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Rich. Davenport</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Davenport</span> <span class="date">June 23d 1766.</span></p></div>
