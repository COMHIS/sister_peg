M.</p><p><span class="linefirst">I receivd all the Books you writ of &amp; your Milton among the rest; when I saw it I perceivd there was a difference betwixt preaching &amp; practizing; You accuse me of niceness &amp; yet practize it most egregiously your self; What was the Necessity of sending your Milton w<sup>ch</sup> I knew you were so fond of?</span> Why! I lent yours &amp; cant get it. But would you not in the same manner have lent your own? Yes. Then Why this Ceremony &amp; Goodbreeding? I write all this to show you how easily any Action may be brought to bear the Countenance of a Fault; you may justify your self very well by saying it was kindness &amp; I am satisfy'd w<sup>t</sup> it &amp; thank you for it. So in the same manner I may justify my self from your Reproofs. You say That I would not send in my papers because they were not polishd nor brought to any form; w<sup>ch</sup> you say is Nicety. But was it not reasonable? Would you have me send in my loose, uncorrect thoughts? Were such worth the transcribing? All the progress that I made is but drawing the Outlines, in loose bits of Paper; here a hint of a passion, there a Phenomenon in the mind accounted for, in another the alteration of these accounts; sometimes a remark upon an Author I have been reading, And none of them worth to any Body &amp; I believe scarce to my self. They only design I had of mentioning any of them at all was to see what you would have said of your own, whether they were of the same kind &amp; if you would send any &amp; I have got my End for you have given a most satisfactory reason for not communicating them, by promising they shall be told viva voce; a much better way indeed &amp; in w<sup>ch</sup> I promise my self much satisfaction; for the free Conversation of a friend is what I would preferr to any Entertainment; just now I am entirely confind to my self &amp; Library for Diversion, since we parted</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText">... ea sola voluptas</p></div><p>Solamen<span class="underline">q</span> mali<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; indeed to me they are not a small one; for I take no more of them than I please, for I hate task-reading, &amp; I diversify them at my Pleasure; sometimes a Philosopher, sometimes a Poet; w<sup>ch</sup> change is not unpleasant nor disservicable neither; for what will more surely engrave upon my mind a Tusculan Dispute of Cicero's de ægritudine lenienda than an Eclogue or Georgick of Virgils; the Philosophers Wiseman, &amp; the Poets husbandman agree in peace of mind, in a Liberty &amp; Independancy on Fortune, &amp; Contempt of Riches, Power &amp; Glory. Every thing is placid &amp; quiet in both; nothing perturbd or disorderd.</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText">At secura quies &amp; nescia fallere vita <br />Speluncae, vivi<span class="underline">q</span> laci; at frigida Tempe <br />Mugitus<span class="underline">q</span> boum molles<span class="underline">q</span> sub arbore somnos <br />Non absint — <span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p></div><p>These Lines will in my Opinion come nothing short of the Instruction of the finest Sentence in Cicero. And is more to me; as Virgils Life is more the Subject of my Ambition, being what I can apprehend to be more w<sup>t</sup>in my power. For the perfectly Wise man that outbraves Fortune is surely greater than the Husbandman who slips by her; And indeed this pastoral &amp; Saturnian happyness I have in a great measure come at, just now; I live like a King pretty much by my self;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Neither full of Action of Action<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> nor perturbation, Molles somnos. This State however I can forsee is not to be rely'd on; My peace of Mind is no sufficiently confirmd by Philosophy to w<sup>t</sup>stand the Blows of Fortune; This Greatness &amp; Elevation of Soul is to be found only in Study &amp; contemplation, this can alone teach us to look down upon upon<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> humane Accidents. You must allow [me] to talk thus like a Philosopher; tis a Subject I think much on &amp; could talk all day long off, B[ut]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> I know I must not trouble you. Wherefore I wisely practice my Rules; w<sup>ch</sup> prescribe to check our Appetite; And for a Morification<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> shall descend from these Superior Regions to low &amp; ordinary Life; &amp; so far as to tell you. That John<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> has bought a horse he thinks it neither cheap nor dear, it cost 6 Guineas but will be sold cheaper ag<sup>st</sup> winter, w<sup>ch</sup> he is not resolv'd on as yet; it has no fault but bogles a little; It is tolerably well favord. And paces naturally. Mamma<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> bids me tell you y<sup>t</sup> Sir John Home is not going to Town, but he saw Eccles in the Countrey who says he will do nothing in y<sup>t</sup> Affair. for he is only taking off old Adjudications; So it is needless to let him see the papers; She desires you would trouble yourself to enquire about the Earle's Affairs &amp; Advise us what to do in this Affair. If it were not breaking the formal Rule of Connexions I have prescribed my self in this Letter; &amp; it did not seem unnatural to raise my self from so low Affairs as Horses and papers to so high &amp; elevate things as Books &amp; Study I would tell you y<sup>t</sup> I read some of Longinus already &amp; I am mightily delighted w<sup>t</sup> him; I think he does really answer the Character of being the great Sublime he describes, he delivers his precepts w<sup>t</sup> such force as if he were enchanted w<sup>t</sup> the Subject; And is himself an Author that may be be<span href="/item/humedaOU0010009a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> cited for an Example to his own Rules by any who shall be so adventurous [?] as to write upon his Subject.</p></div>
