	<div id="humedaOU0030041a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Edmondstone</p><p><span class="linefirst">I believe it is a Rule in Law,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> that any Summons prevents [P]rescription,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> and in like manner that the wakening a Process keeps one's Rank in the Lord's Row.</span> It is with some such View, that I now write to you; not to send you a formal Letter, which woud require a formal Answer, &amp; woud therefore get no Answer at all: But just to take a Shake of your hand, &amp; ask you how you do, and speak a little Nonsense to you as usual, and then fall into S[ilence]<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> without giving myself the trouble of supporting the Conversation any lo[nger.]<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> And in a word, keep you from forgeting that you have some such Friend in the World as myself.</p><p>But pray, why did you not write me as you promisd, &amp; give me your Direction? Was you afraid I shou'd write to you. You see I can find out a Method of directing to you without your Information.</p><p>Tell me about the Epigoniad:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Was there ever so much fine Versification bestow'd on so indifferent a Story? Has it had any Success in Ireland? I fancy not: For the Criticklingys<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> in Dublin depend on the Criticklings in London, who depend on the Booksellers, who depend on their Interest, which depends on their printing a Book themselves. This is the Cause, why Wilkies Book is at present neglected, or damn'd as they call it: But I am much mistaken, if it end so. Pray, what says the Primate<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> of it? I hear he has the Generosity to support damnd Books, till their Resurrection; and that he is one of the Saints who pray them out of Purgatory. I hope he is an honest Fellow and one of [us.]<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Captain Masterton<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> told me, that he was not quite of my Opinion with regard to the Douglas,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> &amp; that he blam'd my dedicatory Address to the Author. But I persist still, and will prove, in spite of him &amp; you, and of every man, who [wears eit]her<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> black or scarlet, that it is an admirable Tragedy, comparable [to the ex]cellent<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Pieces of the good Age of Louis quatorze. The Author is here at present, and is refitting his Agis<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> for the Theatre, which I hope will have Justice done it. <em>Il est le mieux renté de touts les beaux esprits</em>:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> He has a Pension from his royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, as you have probably heard.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span></p><p>I hear some times from the Doctor,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> who desires me to tell him something about you: But I am no Necromancer. Only as the Antients said, <em>Prudentia est quaedam divinatio</em>:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> I conjecture, that you are lownging &amp; reading &amp; playing at Whist, and blaming yourself for not writing Letters, and yet persisting in the Neglect of your Duty.</p><p><span href="/item/humedaOU0030041a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> I am engag'd in writing a New Volume of History from the Beginning of Henry the VII till the Accession of James the I. It will probably be published winter after the next.
