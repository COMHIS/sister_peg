	<div id="humedaOU0020097a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I fancy Mr Macleane's Questions are by this time answerd to his Satisfaction:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020097a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> For my Friends at Paris have thought it absolutely necessary to publish a Narrative of the whole Affair between Rousseau and me, translated from an Account I sent them.</span> I believe the World never heard of so ridiculous and absurd an Affair.</p><p>Allan Ramsay is in this Country but I have not yet seen him. I spoke to him in London of the Affair you mention;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020097a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> but he says, that there is no Engraver here (I suppose he excepts Strange, who is otherwise employ'd) that is capable of doing a head tolerably. I am much, much better pleasd to have the Edition come out without it: I am indeed averse to the prefixing a Print of the Author, as savouring of Vanity.</p><p>I am just now recovering myself of my Habits of Dissipation, and returning to my old Habits of Study &amp; Retreat. I shall not lose Sight of the Object you mention,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020097a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> as soon as I think Affairs are ripe for it. I woud fain see the Prejudices of Faction a little more abated, in order to smooth the way for my Access to the Cabinets of the Great: For really I am not qualify'd for overcoming any Difficulties of that Nature.</p><p>About two Years ago, I wrote you, that I had left with my Sister a corrected Copy of my History, which I woud desire her to send you. You wrote to Kincaid who sent for it, and sent it to you in a Parcel of Strahan's. This Circumstance is enterd by Kincaid in his Minute Book of 16 of Oct<sup>r</sup> 1764. When in London, I asked you about this Copy; and you told me, that you had never heard of it. I suppose this is only a Defect of Memory. I shoud be very vext it was lost. Please enquire about it; and if you recover it, be so good as to send it me by the Waggon. I beg my sincere Compliments to Mrs Millar. I hope to be often merry with you &amp; her in your House in Pall-Mall; and I wish both of you much Health &amp; Satisfaction in enjoying it. I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">21 of Oct<sup>r</sup> 1766</span></p></div>
