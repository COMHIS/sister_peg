I shall scarcely ever think of correcting any more; tho' I own that the receiving of the Sheets regularly by the post has been an Amusement and Occupation to me, which I shall have a Difficulty to supply. I fancy I must take to some kind of Composition in its place.</p><p>Pray, have you gone any length in printing the other Volumes, or are you now to begin? In this case, you can scarcely publish this Season. But as you have probably a very large fount of this Type, I hope you are pretty well advancd. I need not put you in mind of sending me a dozen Copies of the History, and half a dozen of the philosophical Pieces.</p><p>Your Encomium on the Princess Dowager<span href="/item/humedaOU0020259a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> is elegantly written, and contains a very proper and spirited Reprehension of the scurrillous and scoundrel Patriots who had so long abus'd her. I wonder what they will now do for a Pretence to their Sedition.</p><p>I have lately heard a Story, extremely to the King's Advantage; which I shoud be glad to find confirmd. I am told, that this parliamentary Enquiry into the Proceedings of the East India Company did not originally proceed from the Ministry, but from the King himself, who was shockd with the Accounts he receivd of the Oppressions exercisd over the poor Natives, and demanded a Remedy.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020259a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> I wish it may be possible to provide any, that will be durable. I trust much in the Integrity of Andrew Stuart (who, they say, will certainly be one of the Supervisors<span href="/item/humedaOU0020259a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>) for the carrying of such a Plan into Execution.</p><p>I hear also that there is an Intention of appointing Professor Ferguson Secretary to the Commission.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020259a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> Surely there is not a man of greater Worth in the World. If you have a Vote or Interest, I beseech you, employ it all in his favour, as well for his Advantage as for that of Humanity.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Faithfully Yours</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
