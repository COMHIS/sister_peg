Mallet told me that he was sure there was no Englishman capable of composing such a work. The town will have it that you was educated at Oxford, thinking it impossible for a mere untravelled Scotchman to produce such language.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010297a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> In short, you may depend on the success of your work, and that your name is known very much to your advantage.</p><p>I am diverting myself with the notion how much you will profit by the applause of my enemies in Scotland. Had you and I been such fools as to have given way to jealousy, to have entertained animosity and malignity against each other, and to have rent all our acquaintance into parties, what a noble amusement we should have exhibited to the blockheads, which now they are likely to be disappointed of. All the people whose friendship or judgment either of us value, are friends to both, and will be pleased with the success of both, as we will be with that of each other. <span class="linelast">I declare to you I have not of a long time had a more sensible pleasure than the good reception of your History has given me within this fortnight . . . .</span></p></div>
