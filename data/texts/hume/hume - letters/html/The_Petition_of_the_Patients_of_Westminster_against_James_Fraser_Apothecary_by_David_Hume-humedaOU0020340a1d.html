And had she not thrown it up with great Violence, it had certainly prov'd fatal to her.</p><p>That the said James Fraser &amp; his Associates now finding that this <em>Catholicon</em> does not agree with the Constitution of the said Dame, prescribe to her large Dozes of <em>Phillipiacum</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, <em>Cottontium</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/007" title="7 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>, &amp; <em>Vandeputiana</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/008" title="8 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>, in order to alter her Constitution &amp; prepare her Body for the Reception of the said Catholicon.</p><p>That he had even been pleas'd to see <em>Lovitium</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/009" title="9 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> apply'd to her, tho known to be a virulent Caustic, and really no better than <em>Lapis infernalis</em>.</p><p>That while the Medicines, Goveriacum<span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/010" title="10 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> and Trentuntium<span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/011" title="11 [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span>, were very violent, resembling sublimate or <em>high-flown</em> Mercury, he also much approv'd of them; but since they were mollify'd by late Operations, and made as innocent as Mercurius Dulcis, they were become his utter Aversion.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020340a1d/nts/012" title="12 [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span></p><p>That the said James Fraser, thro' his whole Practice on the said Dame Public, entirely rejected all Lenitives, Soporifics, Palliatives, &amp;c, tho approv'd of by the regular &amp; graduate Physicians, as Dr Pelham, Dr Fox, Dr Pitt; and that he prescrib'd nothing but Chymical Salts &amp; stimulating Medicines, in which Regimen, none but Quacks &amp; Empirics, who had never taken their Degrees, will agree with him.</p><p>That your Petitioners remember the Story of an Irish Servant to a Physician, which seem fitted to the present Purpose. The Doctor bid Teague carry a Potion to a Patient, &amp; tell him it was the most innocent in the World, &amp; if it did him no good, coud do him no harm. The Footman obeys, but unluckily transposing a Word, said that if it did him no Harm, it cou'd do him no Good: And your Petitioners are much afraid, that the Catholicon abovemention'd is much of the same Nature;</p><p>May it therefore please your Worships to discharge the said James Fraser from any farther Attendance on the said Dame Public, &amp; to order him to return to the Care &amp; Inspection of your Petitioners &amp; their Families.</p></div>
