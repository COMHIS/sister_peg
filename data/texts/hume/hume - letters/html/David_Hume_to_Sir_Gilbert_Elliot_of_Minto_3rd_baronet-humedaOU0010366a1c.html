	<div id="humedaOU0010366a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">5 July, 1762.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I received a letter, a few days ago, from a lady in the Court of France, with whom I have been for some time in an epistolary correspondence, and who bears a very high character for knowledge and merit.</span> She had wrote to me on the supposition I was still in London, because my last letter to her was dated from that place; and she recommends to me, in very earnest terms, the famous Rousseau, who is obliged to fly France, on account of some passages in a new <em>Treatise of Education</em> which he has published.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010366a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> You may believe, that it gave me great uneasiness that I could not fulfil a duty which would have been so agreeable to me, and which would have connected me with a man whose character and talents I so much admire. I do not remember whether I have ever had a conversation with you on the writings of that author, and I know not whether you esteem them as much as I do. For my part, tho I see some tincture of extravagance in all of them, I also think I see so much eloquence and force of imagination, such an energy of expression, and such a boldness of conception, as entitles him to a place among the first writers of the age. As to his personal character, I shall give it you in the words of my correspondent, after remarking that all the world speaks of him in the same style....<span href="/item/humedaOU0010366a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p><p>I own that I was extremely struck with the situation of so extraordinary a man, and having a great desire of being of some use to him, tho absent, I have ventured to give you this trouble. Our present King and present Minister<span href="/item/humedaOU0010366a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> are desirous of being thought encouragers of learning: can they have a more proper opportunity of showing to the whole world that they are in earnest? Monsieur Rousseau is now thrown out of his ordinary course of livelihood; and tho he rejects presents from private persons, he may not think himself degraded by a pension from a great monarch: and it would be a singular victory over the French, worth a hundred of our Mindens, to protect and encourage a man of genius whom they had persecuted. I beseech you to advance this topic in places where your opinion may be able to produce the desired effect. It would be a favour to the ministers to suggest such an action to them. I fancy Rousseau's crime is only some sallies of Republicanism, and Protestantism, and satire against French manners; for I do not find that, in any of his writings, he has ever gone farther.</p><p>I have hitherto been a wanderer on the face of the earth, without any abiding city; but I have now at last purchased a house, which I am repairing, tho I cannot say that I have yet fixed any property in the earth, but only in the air: for it is the third story of James's Court,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010366a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and it cost me five hundred pounds. It is somewhat dear, but I shall be exceedingly well lodged. On comparing my situation with poor Roussseau's, I cannot but reflect how much better booksellers we have in this country than they in France.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Sir, <br />Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010366a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p></div>
