	<div id="humedaOU0010212a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I told you, that I intended to apply to the Faculty for Redress; and if refusd, to throw up the Library.</span> I was assur'd that two of the Curators<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> intended before the Faculty to declare their Willingness to redress me, after which there cou'd be no Difficulty to gain a Victory over the other two. But before the day came, the Dean<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> prevaild on them to change their Resolution, &amp; joind them himself with all his Interest. I saw it then impossible to succeed, &amp; accordingly retracted my Application: But being equally unwilling to lose the Use of the Books &amp; to bear an Indignity; I retain the Office, but have given Blacklock, our blind Poet, a Bond of Annuity for the Sallary. I have now put it out of these malicious Fellows power to offer me any Indignity; while my Motives for remaining in this Office are so apparent. I shou'd be glad that you approve of my Conduct: I own I am satisfy'd with myself.</p><p>Pray tell me, &amp; tell me ingenuously, What Success has my History met with among the Judges with you, I mean Dr Cullen,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Mr Betham,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Mrs Betham, Mr Leechman, Mr Muirhead,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Mr Crawford,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> &amp;c? Dare I presume, that it has been thought worthy of Examination, &amp; that its Beauties are found to overballance its Defects? I am very desirous to know my Errors, &amp; I dare swear you think me tolerably docile, to be so veterane an Author. I cannot indeed hope soon to have an Opportunity of correcting my Errors; this Impression is so very numerous. The Sale indeed has been very great in Edinburgh; but how it goes on at London, we have not been precisely inform'd. In all Cases, I am desirous of storing up Instruction, &amp; as you are now idle (I mean, have nothing but your Class to teach: Which to you is comparative Idleness) I will insist upon hearing from you.</p><p>Pray tell Mr Crawford, that I sent a Copy to Lord Cathcart,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010212a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> as he desird.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir <br />Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">17 Dec<sup>r</sup> 1754.</span></p></div>
