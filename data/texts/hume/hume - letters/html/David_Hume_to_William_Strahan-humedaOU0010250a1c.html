	<div id="humedaOU0010250a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I find it has been often objected to My natural History of Religion, that it wants order.</span> That I may obviate that Objection, I am resolv'd to prefix the enclosd Contents to it, if the Volume<span href="/item/humedaOU0010250a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> be not yet finish'd, which I hope it is not. These are the Titles of the several Sections. I shoud likewise desire, that the Title of each Section be prefixd to the Section. This will help the Reader to see the Scope of the Discourse. If you make a whole Leaf of a Title Page to the Natural History, the Summary of the Contents may be printed on it: If you do not, it may be printed at the End of the natural History.</p><p>I must also desire you to print the enclosd Advertisement.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010250a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I fancy the most commodious Place for it will be at the End of the general Contents of the whole Volume.</p><p>If it be not too late, please also to make this slight Alteration in the 4 Dissertations. P. 94 l 7. read <em>and must augment</em>. P. 216. l. 11. for <em>Dissertation</em> read <em>Essay</em>. But I am afraid this last correction comes too late. P. 229. l. 16. for <em>Dissertation</em> read <em>Essay</em>.</p><p>I have begun a new Work some time ago, tho' I did not fix my Resolutions of persevering, till I shoud find, that I was pleas'd [with] it. It is the writing the History of England from the Accession of Henry the VII. I wish I had from the first begun at that Period. It is really the Commencement of modern History; and I shoud have obviated many Objections to my History of the Stuarts, by taking Matters so high. However this retrogade <span class="edComment">[sic]</span> Motion is not unusual. Tacitus wrote his Annals after his History; tho' they treat of a preceding Period. I do not however preclude myself from the Purpose of writing the Period after the Revolution, by my undertaking this Work; but shall be somewhat advanc'd before I go to London. I have more Command of Books here, than I cou'd easily have had in that Place; at least such Books as suit this Subject. For it is much to be lamented that there are no public Libraries in London.</p><p>I am extremely pleasd with the Correctness of this Edition of my philosophical Writings, so far as it has gone. I have not seen any thing better executed in that particular. The Type &amp; Paper are also very good. I am Dear Sir</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinr</span></span> <span class="date">25 May 1757</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>I have receivd eleven Sheets &amp; shall have an Index ready very soon.</p><p>I have wrote to Mr Millar of a new Epic Poem that is to be publishd this Week in Edinburgh: It is calld the Epigoniad, &amp; is wrote by one Mr Wilkie, a Minister. It is a Production of great Genius. I recommend it to you to read it when it comes to London. If you like it you will naturally speak of it among your Acquaintance.</p></div></div>
