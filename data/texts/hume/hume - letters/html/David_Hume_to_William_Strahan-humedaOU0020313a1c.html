I beg that after the four first are printed off a Copy of the new Edition of them may be sent me by the Waggon, that I may return you the Errata.</p><p>I am very much taken with Mr Gibbon's Roman History which came from your Press, and am glad to hear of its success. There will no Books of Reputation now be printed in London but through your hands and Mr Cadel's. The Author tells me, that he is already preparing a second Edition. I intended to have given him my Advice with regard to the manner of printing it; but as I am now writing to you, it is the same thing. He ought certainly to print the Number of the Chapter at the head of the Margin, and it woud be better if something of the Contents coud also be added. One is also plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method of printing the Book: When a note is announced, you turn to the End of the Volume; and there you often find nothing but the Reference to an Authority: All these Authorities ought only to be printed at the Margin or the Bottom of the Page.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020313a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I desire, that a Copy of my new Edition shoud be sent to Mr Gibbon, as wishing that a Gentleman, whom I so highly value, shoud peruse me in the form the least imperfect, to which I can bring my work.</p><p>We heard that yours and Mr Cadell's Warehouses had been consumed by fire: I intended to have written you on the Occasion, but as I received a Letter from you a few Posts after, in which you mentioned nothing of the Matter, I concluded the Rumor to be false. Dr Robertson tells me, that there was some Foundation for the Report; but that your Loss was inconsiderable; and that your Copies were insured.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020313a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I shoud not have been sorry, if some Bales of my Essays had been in the Number; as I think I coud make some Improvements in a new Edition.</p><p>Dr Smith's Performance is another excellent Work that has come from your Press this Winter; but I have ventured to tell him, that it requires too much thought to be as popular as Mr Gibbon's.</p><p>If your Ministry have as much Reflection and Combination of thought as to make a successful Expedition on the other Side of the Atlantic with 40,000 men, they will much disappoint my Expectations. They seem to have gone wrong already by the Lateness of their Embarkations. But we shall see, which is the utmost that can be said in most Affairs of this Nature.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020313a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p></div>
