	<div id="humedaOU0030080a1c"><p class="salutation">Madam,</p><p><span class="linefirst">The agreeable present<span href="/item/humedaOU0030080a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> which you was so good as to make me, did not come to hand till a few days ago; it had been packed up with some of Lord Hertford's baggage, and was so long on the road: I should not otherwise have been so long wanting to express my thanks for the pleasure your performance has given me;<span href="/item/humedaOU0030080a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and also for the obliging manner in which you mention me, even when you oppose my sentiments.</span> I find, indeed, that you often do me the honor to keep me in your eye, during the course of your narration; and I flatter myself that we differ less in facts, than in our interpretation and construction of them. Perhaps also I have the misfortune to differ from you in some original principles, which it will not be easy to adjust between us.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030080a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> For as I look upon all kinds of subdivision of power, from the monarchy of France to the freest democracy of some Swiss Cantons, to be equally legal, if established by custom and authority; I cannot but think, that the mixed monarchy of England, such as it was left by Queen Elizabeth, was a lawful form of government, and carried obligations to obedience and allegiance; at least it must be acknowledged, that the princes and ministers who supported that form, tho' somewhat arbitrarily, could not incur much blame on that account; and that there is more reason to make an apology for their antagonists than for them. I grant, that the cause of liberty, which you, Madam, with the Pyms and Hampdens have adopted, is noble and generous; but most of the partizans of that cause, in the last century disgraced it, by their violence, and also by their cant, hypocrisy, and bigotry, which, more than the principles of civil liberty, seem to have been the motive of all their actions. Had those principles always appeared in the amiable light which they receive both from your person and writings, it would have been impossible to resist them; and however much inclined to indulgence towards the first James and Charles, I should have been the first to condemn those monarchs for not yielding to them. But lest you think that the air of this place has infected me with the style of gallantry, I beg leave to conclude, by expressing my great esteem of your history, and my great personal respect for yourself. I beg my compliments to the doctor; and am, Madam, with great sincerity,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">29th March, 1764</span></p></div>
