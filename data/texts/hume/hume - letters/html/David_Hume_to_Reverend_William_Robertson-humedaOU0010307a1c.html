	<div id="humedaOU0010307a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">29 May, 1759.</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I had a letter from Helvétius lately,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010307a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> wrote before your book arrived at Paris.</span> He tells me, that the Abbé Prévôt, who had just finished the translation of my History, <em>paroît très disposé à</em> <em>traduire l'Histoire d'Écosse que vient de faire Monsieur Robertson</em>. If he be engaged by my persuasion, I shall have the satisfaction of doing you a real credit and pleasure: for he is one of the best pens in Paris.</p><p>I looked with great impatience in your new edition<span href="/item/humedaOU0010307a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> for the note you seemed to intend with regard to the breach of the Capitulation of Perth; and was much disappointed at missing it. I own that I am curious on that head. I cannot so much as imagine a colour upon which their accusations could possibly be founded. The articles were only two; indemnity to the inhabitants, and the exclusion of French soldiers — now, that Scotch national troops were not Frenchmen and foreigners seems pretty apparent: and both Knox and the manifesto of the Congregation acquit the Queen-Regent of any breach of the first article, as I had observed in my note to page 422. This makes me suspect that some facts have escaped me; and I beg you to indulge my curiosity by informing me of them.</p><p>Our friend Smith is very successful here, and Gerard<span href="/item/humedaOU0010307a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is very well received. The <em>Epigoniad</em> I cannot so much promise for, tho I have done all in my power to forward it, particularly by writing a letter to the <em>Critical Review</em>, which you may peruse. I find, however, some good judges profess a great esteem for it, but <em>habent et sua fata libelli</em>: however, if you want a little flattery to the author, (which I own is very refreshing to an author) you may tell him that Lord Chesterfield<span href="/item/humedaOU0010307a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> said to me he was a great poet. I imagine that Wilkie will be very much elevated by praise from an English earl, and a Knight of the Garter, and an Ambassador, and a Secretary of State, and a man of so great reputation. For I observe that the greatest rustics are commonly most affected with such circumstances.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Ferguson's book has a great deal of genius and fine writing, and will appear in time....</span></p></div>
