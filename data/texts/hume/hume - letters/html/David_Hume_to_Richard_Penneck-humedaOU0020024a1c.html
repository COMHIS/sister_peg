Be so kind as to write to any Correspondent in that Country; and try whether you cou'd not find a Place, where he coud board at reasonable Rate, he and his Gouvernante: He wishes, that the Price cou'd be fixed for Bed, boarding, washing and firing; or for as many of these Circumstances as possible.
