Was you afraid I should write to you? You see I can find out a method of directing to you without your information.</p><p>Tell me about the <em>Epigoniad</em>. Was there ever so much fine versification bestowed on so indifferent a story? Has it had any success in Ireland? I fancy not; for the criticklings in Dublin depend on the criticklings in London, who depend on the booksellers, who depend on their interest, which depends on their printing a book themselves. This is the cause why Wilkie's book is at present neglected, or damned, as they call it: but I am much mistaken if it end so. Pray what says the Primate<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> of it? I hear he has the generosity to support damned books till the Resurrection, and that he is one of the saints who pray them out of Purgatory. I hope he is an honest fellow and one of [us].<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Captain Masterton<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> told me, that he was not quite of my opinion with regard to the <em>Douglas</em>, and that he blamed my dedicatory address to the author. But I persist still, and will prove in spite of him and you, and of every man who [wears eit]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> her black or scarlet, that it is an admirable tragedy, comparable [to the exce]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> llent pieces of the good Age of Louis Quatorze. The author is here at present, and is refitting his <em>Agis</em> for the theatre, which I hope will have justice done it.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> <em>Il est le mieux renté de tous les beaux esprits</em>. He has a pension from his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, as you have probably heard.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010268a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span></p><p>I hear sometimes from the Doctor, who desires me to tell him something about you. But I am no necromancer; only, as the ancients said — <em>prudentia est quaedam divinatio</em>. I conjecture that you are lounging, and reading, and playing at whist, and blaming yourself for not writing letters, and yet persisting in the neglect of your duty.</p></div>
