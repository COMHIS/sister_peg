	<div id="rousjeVF0300099a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear D<sup>r</sup></p><p>I go in a few hours to Woburn<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>; so can only give you the Outline of my History. Thro many Difficulties I obtain'd a Pension for Rousseau. The Application was made with his own Consent &amp; Knowledge. I write him, that all is happily compleated, and he needs only draw for the Money. He answers me, that I am a Rouge and a Rascal<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, and have brought him into England, merely to dishonour him. I demand the Reason of this strange Language; and Mr Davenport, the Gentleman with whom he lives, tells him, that he must necessarily satisfy me. To day, I receiv'd a Letter from him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, which is perfect Frenzy: It woud make a good eighteen-penny Pamphlet; and I fancy he intends to publish it. He there tells me, that D'Alembert, Horace Walpole and I had <span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> from the first<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> enterd into a Combination to ruin him; and had ruin'd him: That the first Suspicion of my Treachery arose in him, while we lay together in the same Room of an Inn in France: I there spoke in my Sleep and betray'd my Intention of ruining him: That young Tronc[h]in lodg'd in the same House with me at London; and Annie Elliot<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> lookd very coldly at him as he went by her in the Passage: That I am also in a close Confederacy with Lord Lyttleton, who he hears<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> is his mortal Enemy: That the English Nation were very fond of him on his first Arrival; but that Horace Walpole &amp; I had totally alienated them from him. He owns, however, that his Belief of my Treachery went<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> no higher than Suspicion while he was in London; but it rose to Certainty after he arrivd in the Country: For that there were several Publications in the Papers against him, which coud have proceeded from no body but me or my Confederate Horace Walpole. The rest is all of <span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> a like<span href="/item/rousjeVF0300099a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> Strain, intermix'd with many Lyes and much Malice. I own, that I was very anxious about this Affair but this Letter has totally reliev'd me. I write in a hurry, merely to satisfy your Curiosity. I hope soon to see you; and am Dear S<sup>ir</sup></p><p class="signoff">Yours most sincerely <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="date">15<sup>th</sup> of July 1766</span></p></div>
