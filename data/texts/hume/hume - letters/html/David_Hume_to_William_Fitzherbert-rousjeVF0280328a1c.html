	<div id="rousjeVF0280328a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p>I called on you this morning, in order to speak to you about poor Rousseau, who is still somewhat undetermined in his projects; I told him of the kind offer you made him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280328a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, of which he retains a due sense; but when I told him that your sister lived in the house, he feared that he would constrain her, and he was very sorry he could reap no advantage by your goodness. I then told him of Mr. Davenport's offer<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280328a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, which, as Mr. Garrick tells me, you mentioned to him. He seems to like it extremely, and I doubt not but he may accept of it, provided Mr. Davenport will accept of board. I hope he will be so indulgent as to comply with this caprice of my friend; and I would propose thirty pounds a year for board, firing, and washing. I mention this sum, because M. Rousseau can spare it, and it was mentioned as the board he should pay for himself and his gouvernante, to a farmer in Wales. I shall only propose a few questions: — 1. Is there wood and hills about Mr. Davenport's house? 2. Cannot Mr. Rousseau, if he should afterwards think proper, find a means to boil a pot, and roast a piece of meat, in Mr. Davenport's house, so as to be perfectly at home? 3. Will Mr. Davenport, in that case, be so good as to accept of a small rent for an apartment; for this circumstance, I find is necessary. 4. Can Mr. Rousseau set out presently and take possession of his habitation? I should be glad, if by your means I could have a conversation with Mr. Davenport; and shall wait on him, at any time or place, he shall please to appoint me.</p><p>I am Sir,</p><p>Your most obedient humble servant,</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb">At Miss Elliot's, in Lisle street, <span class="loc">Leicester Fields</span> Tuesday afternoon.</p></div>
