	<div id="humedaOU0010189a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">Sept. 1, 1754</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I desire you to give me joy.</span> <em><span lang="la">Jamque opus exegi &amp;c</span></em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010189a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> This day I received from the press the last sheet of the volume of history which I intended to publish; and I am already well advanced in composing the second volume. It was impossible for the booksellers to refuse to several the sight of the sheets as we went on; and Whig and Tory, and Tory and Whig (for I will alternately give them the precedence), combine as I am told in approving of my politics. A few Christians only (and but a few) think I speak like a Libertine in religion: be assured I am tolerably reserved on this head. Elliot tells me that you had entertained apprehensions of my discretion: what I had done to forfeit with you the character of prudence, I cannot tell, but you will see little or no occasion for any such imputation in this work. I composed it <em><span lang="la">ad populum</span></em>, as well as <em><span lang="la">ad clerum</span></em>, and thought, that scepticism was not in its place in an historical production.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010189a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I shall take care to convey a copy to you by the first opportunity, and shall be very proud of your approbation, and no less pleased with your reprehensions.</p><p>Our friend Aber<span href="/item/humedaOU0010189a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> is again to enjoy the privilege of franking after a <em><span lang="la">hiatus valde deflendus</span></em>. Edmonstone is at Peterhead drinking the waters for his health. Sir Harry lives among his boroughs, but not so assiduous in his civilities as formerly; an instance of ingratitude which one would not expect in a man of such nice honour. I was lately told, that one day last winter he went to pay a visit to a deacon’s wife, who happened in that very instant to be gutting fish. He came up to her with open arms, and said he hoped madam was well, and that the young ladies her daughters were in good health. 'Oh, come not near me,' cried she, ’Sir Harry; I am in a sad pickle, as nasty as a beast.' — 'Not at all, madam,' replied he, 'you are in a very agreeable négligé.' 'Well,' said she, 'I shall never be able to understand your fine English.' — 'I mean, madam,' returned he, ’that you are drest in a very genteel <em>deshabille</em>.'</p><p>There is a young man of this country, Mr Thomas Blacklock, who has discovered a very fine genius for poetry, and under very extraordinary circumstances. He is the son of a poor tradesman, and was born blind; yet, notwithstanding these disadvantages, he has been able to acquire a great knowledge of Greek, Latin, and French, and to be well acquainted with all the classics in these languages, as well as in our own. He published last winter a volume of Miscellanies, which all men of taste admired extremely for their purity, elegance, and correctness; nor were they devoid of force and invention. I sent up half a dozen to Dodsley,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010189a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> desiring him to keep one, and to distribute the rest among men of taste of his acquaintance. I find they have been much approved of, and that Mr Spence,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010189a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> in particular, has entertained thoughts of printing a new edition by subscription, for the benefit of the author. You are an acquaintance of Mr Spence: encourage, I beseech you, so benevolent a thought, and promote it every where by your recommendation. The young man has a great deal of modesty, virtue, and goodness, as well as of genius, and notwithstanding very strict frugality, is in great necessities; but curst, or blest, with that honest pride of nature, which makes him uneasy under obligations, and disdain all applications. I need say no more to you. Dear Doctor, believe me, with great honesty and affection,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your friend and servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
