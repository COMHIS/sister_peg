	<div id="humedaOU0020227a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am not in the least angry with Mr. Cadel: On the contrary, were I to go to the press with any new work (which it is utterly impossible I ever shoud) he is one of the first persons I should apply to for publishing it.</span> But, pray, recollect, that a few weeks before I came down, he told me in your house of his regret that he shoud ever have been forced by Mr Millar to deceive me; but that now I might entirely depend upon the Truth of his Information; there were less than 700 of the 8vo Edition upon hand. But after a twelvemonth's rapid sale, as he pretends, he acknowledges nine hundred and fifty, and I question not but there is above double the Number.</p><p>There has been a strange Fatality to depress the reputation of that book: First the Extravagance of Baillie Hamilton, then the Rapaciousness of Mr Millar: But this last is most incurable. I suppose you will not find one book in the English Language of that Size and Price so ill printed,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020227a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and now since the publication of the Quarto, however small the sale of the Quarto may be, it shows, by its corrections and additions, the Imperfection of the 8vo so visibly, that it must be totally discredited. Had it been thought proper to let me know the real State of the 8vo Edition, I shoud never have consented to the printing of the Quarto. I suppose the Proprietors will at last be oblig'd to destroy all that remains of the 8vo; I mean, if there appear any hopes of the Sale's ever reviving. If Mr Millar had been alive, his own Interest, as well as the Shame for his Miscarriage, woud have brought him to that Resolution. There remains only the former Motive with the Proprietors.</p><p>I return the Sheet of the Essays which is very elegantly printed. The numerous Editions of that work, which is much less calculated for public Sale, may convince you of the Propriety of moderate Editions. I hope Mr Cadel will send me down six copies as soon as the Edition is finishd, that I may have the Satisfaction of seeing one of my Works without Disgust.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">21 of June 1770</span></p></div>
