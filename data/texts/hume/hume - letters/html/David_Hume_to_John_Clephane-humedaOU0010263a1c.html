I wish, indeed, that I had begun there: For by that means, I should have been able, without making any digression, by the plain course of the narration, to have shown how absolute the authority was, which the English kings then possessed, and that the Stuarts did little or nothing more than continue matters in the former tract, which the people were determined no longer to admit. By this means I should have escaped the reproach of the most terrible <em>ism</em> of them all, that of Jacobitism. I shall certainly be in London next summer; and probably to remain there during life; at least, if I can settle myself to my mind, which I beg you to have an eye to. A room in a sober, discreet family, who would not be averse to admit a sober, discreet, virtuous, frugal, regular, quiet, good-natured man of a bad character; such a room, I say, would suit me extremely, especially if I could take most of my meals in the family; and more especially still, if it was not far distant from Dr Clephane's.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010263a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I shall then be able, dear Doctor, to spend £150 a year, which is the sum upon which, I remember, you formerly undertook me. But I would not have you reckon upon <em>propapilities</em>, as you then called them, for I am resolved to write no more. I shall read and correct, and chat and be idle, the rest of my life.</p><p>I must now make room for Sir Harry,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010263a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who smiles at the sum at which I have set up my rest. <span class="linelast">I am, Dear D<sup>r</sup>, <br />Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
