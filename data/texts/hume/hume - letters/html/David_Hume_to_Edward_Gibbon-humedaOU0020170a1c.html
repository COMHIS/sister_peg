	<div id="humedaOU0020170a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">It is but a few days ago since Mr Deyverdun<span href="/item/humedaOU0020170a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> put your manuscript<span href="/item/humedaOU0020170a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> into my hands, and I have perused it with great pleasure and satisfaction.</span> I have only one objection, derived from the language in which it is written. Why do you compose in French, and carry faggots into the wood, as Horace says with regard to the Romans who wrote in Greek? I grant that you have a like motive to those Romans, and adopt a language much more generally diffused than your native tongue: but have you not remarked the fate of those two ancient languages in following ages? The Latin, though then less celebrated, and confined to more narrow limits, has in some measure outlived the Greek, and is now more generally understood by men of letters. Let the French, therefore, triumph in the present diffusion of their tongue. Our solid and increasing establishments in America, where we need less dread the inundation of Barbarians, promise a superior stability and duration to the English language.</p><p>Your use of the French tongue has also led you into a style more poetical and figurative, and more highly coloured, than our language seems to admit of in historical productions: for such is the practice of French writers, particularly the more recent ones, who illuminate their pictures more than custom will permit us. On the whole, your History, in my opinion, is written with spirit and judgment; and I exhort you very earnestly to continue it. The objections that occurred to me on reading it were so frivolous that I shall not trouble you with them, and should, I believe, have a difficulty to recollect them.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, with great esteem, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">24th of Oct. 1767</span></p></div>
