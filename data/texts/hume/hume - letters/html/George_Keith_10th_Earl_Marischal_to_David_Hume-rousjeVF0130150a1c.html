He is gay in company, polite, and what the French call <em>aimable</em>, and gains ground dayly in the opinion of even the clergy here; his enemys else where, continue to persecute him, he is pestered with anonimous letters, this is not a country for him, his attachement and love to his native Towne is a strong tye to its neighbourhood, the liberty of England and the character of my good and honored friend D. Hume F—i D—r<span href="/item/rousjeVF0130150a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> (perhaps more singular than that of J. Jaques, for I take him to be the only historian impartial) draws his inclinations to be near to the F—i D—r, for my part, tho it be to me a very great pleasure to converse with the honest savage, yet I advise him to go to England, where he will enjoy <em>Placidam sub libertate quietem</em>.<span href="/item/rousjeVF0130150a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> He wishes to know, if he can print all his works, and make some profit, merely to live, from such an edition. I entreat you will let me know your thoughts on this, and if you can be of use to him in finding him a bookseller to undertake the work, you know he is not interested, and little will content him. If he goes to Brittain, he will be a treasure to you, and you to him, and perhaps both to me (if I were not so old). I have offered him lodging in Keith hall. I am ever with the greatest regard your most obedient servant M.</p><p class="datelineb"> <span class="date">Oct: 2d 1762</span></p></div>
