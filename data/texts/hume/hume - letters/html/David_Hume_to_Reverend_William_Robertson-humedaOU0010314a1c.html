	<div id="humedaOU0010314a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">[London</span></span> <span class="date">Summer 1759]</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">... I have frequently thought, and talked with our common friends upon the subject of your letter.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010314a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> There always occurred to us several difficulties with regard to every subject we could propose. The Ancient Greek History has several recommendations, particularly the good authors from which it must be drawn: but this same circumstance becomes an objection, when more narrowly considered: for what can you do in most places with these authors but transcribe and translate them? No letters or State Papers from which you could correct their errors, or authenticate their narration, or supply their defects. Besides, Rollin is so well wrote with respect to style, that with superficial people it passes for sufficient. There is one Dr Leland,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010314a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who has lately wrote the life of Philip of Macedon, which is one of the best periods. The book, they tell me, is perfectly well wrote; yet it has had such small sale, and has so little excited the attention of the public, that the author has reason to think his labour thrown away. I have not read the book; but by the size, I should judge it to be too particular. It is a pretty large quarto. I think a book of that size sufficient for the whole History of Greece till the death of Philip: and I doubt not but such a work would be successful, notwithstanding all these discouraging circumstances. The subject is noble, and Rollin is by no means equal to it.</p><p>I own, I like still less your project of the Age of Charles the Fifth.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010314a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> That subject is disjointed; and your hero, who is the sole connection, is not very interesting. A competent knowledge at least is required of the state and constitution of the Empire; of the several kingdoms of Spain, of Italy, of the Low Countries; which it would be the work of half a life to acquire; and, tho some parts of the story may be entertaining, there would be many dry and barren; and the whole seems not to have any great charms.</p><p>But I would not willingly start objections to these schemes, unless I had something to propose, which would be plausible; and I shall mention to you an idea which has sometimes pleased me, and which I had once entertained thoughts of attempting. You may observe that among modern readers, Plutarch is in every translation the chief favourite of the Ancients. Numberless translations, and numberless editions have been made of him in all languages; and no translation has been so ill done as not to be successful. Tho those who read the originals never put him in comparison either with Thucydides or Xenophon, he always attaches more the reader in the translation; a proof that the idea and execution of his work is, in the main, happy. Now, I would have you think of writing modern lives, somewhat after that manner: not to enter into a detail of the actions, but to mark the manners of the great personages, by domestic stories, by remarkable sayings, and by a general sketch of their lives and adventures. You see that in Plutarch the life of Caesar may be read in half an hour. Were you to write the life of Henry the Fourth of France after that model, you might pillage all the pretty stories in Sully, and speak more of his mistresses than of his battles. In short, you might gather the flower of all modern history in this manner: the remarkable Popes, the kings of Sweden, the great discoverers and conquerors of the New World; even the eminent men of letters might furnish you with matter, and the quick despatch of every different work would encourage you to begin a new one. If one volume were successful, you might compose another at your leisure, and the field is inexhaustible. There are persons whom you might meet with in the corners of history, so to speak, who would be a subject of entertainment quite unexpected; and as long as you live, you might give and receive amusement by such a work. Even your son, if he had a talent for history, would succeed to the subject, and his son to him. <span class="linelast">I shall insist no farther on this idea; because if it strikes your fancy, you will easily perceive all its advantages, and, by farther thought, all its difficulties.</span></p></div>
