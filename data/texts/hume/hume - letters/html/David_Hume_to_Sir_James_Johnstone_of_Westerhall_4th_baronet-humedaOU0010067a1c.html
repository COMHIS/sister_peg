	<div id="humedaOU0010067a1c"><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">Your friend continues still in good health.</span> He made to Mr Vincent the same proposal about living altogether alone without any friend or companion. He told me so, very politely; adding that he had no exceptions to me, but only that solitude suited him better. I doubt not but this project will be greedily embrac'd by Mr V., as being really the drift of all his measures.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010067a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I suspect it has been instill'd very lately into your friend; for we never heard of it till within these eight days. I still continue in the same resolution of weathering out all the difficulties and discouragements as long as possible, and as long as you can desire me; and I fancy this project will not be urg'd farther, if you oppose it, both because of its unreasonableness, and because it is the taking off the mask too soon. If I continue, you can easily operate a thorough reconciliation betwixt Mr Vincent and me (that is, a thorough seeming one); and it is strange he should affect any coldness, when the only thing he can accuse me of is the having an eye to you and the family, or to any thing beyond himself. He said, when he was here, that we shall live in this house till the lease was out, in spite of all opposition. So much is he a basha, and so little will he communicate or reason with any body.</p><p>If he says anything of me worth telling me (beyond the pretended ingratitude and rebellion), I shall expect you to inform me.</p><p>It is utterly impossible for your friend to live in this house without a companion; because he must, in that case, pass the whole day alone, in a remote corner of a large house, which you easily see is very unsafe and improper; so that Mr V.'s obstinacy with regard to the house entangles him a little.</p><p>I hope you have heard good news from your family. <span class="linelast">I am, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Weldehall</span> <span class="date">Nov. 25, 1745.</span></p></div>
