There remain however, two other points where I have not the good fortune to agree with you, viz., the violation of the Treaty of Perth by Mary of Guise,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> and the innocency of Mary with regard to Babington's conspiracy:<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> but as I had wrote notes upon these passages,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> the public must judge between us. Only allow me to say, that even if you be in the right with regard to the last, (of which, notwithstanding my deference to your authority, I cannot perceive the least appearance) you are certainly too short and abrupt in handling it.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> I believe you go contrary to received opinion; and the point was of consequence enough to merit a note or a dissertation.</p><p>There is still another point in which we differ, and which reduced me to great perplexity. You told me, that all historians had been mistaken with regard to James's behaviour on his mother's trial and execution, that he was not really the pious son he pretended to be, that the appearances which deceived the world, were put on at the solicitation of the French Ambassador, Courcelles, and that I should find all this proved by a manuscript of Dr Campbell's.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> I accordingly spoke of the matter to Dr Campbell, who confirmed what you said, with many additions and amplifications. I desired to have the manuscript, which he sent me. But great was my surprise, when I found the contrary in every page, many praises bestowed on the King's piety both by Courcelles and the French Court; his real grief and resentment painted in the strongest colours; resolutions even taken by him to form an alliance with Philip of Spain, in order to get revenge; repeated advices given him by Courcelles and the French ministers, rather to conceal his resentment, till a proper opportunity offered of taking vengeance. What most displeased me in their affair was, that as I thought myself obliged to follow the ordinary tenor of the printed historian, while you appealed to manuscript, it would be necessary for me to appeal to the same manuscripts, to give extracts of them, and to oppose your conclusions. Tho I knew that I could execute this matter in a friendly and obliging manner for you, yet I own that I was very uneasy at finding myself under a necessity of observing anything which might appear a mistake in your narration. But there came to me a man this morning, who, as I fancied, gave me the key of the difficulty, but without freeing me from my perplexity. This was a man commonly employed by Millar and Strahan to decipher manuscripts. He brought me a letter of yours to Strahan, where you desired him to apply to me in order to point out the passages proper to be inserted in your Appendix, and proper to prove the assertion of your text. You add there, these letters are in the French language. I immediately concluded, that you had not read the manuscripts, but had taken it on Dr Campbell's word: for the letters are in English, translated by I know not whom from the French. I could do nothing on this occasion but desire Strahan to stop the press in printing the Appendix, and stay till I wrote to you. If I could persuade you to change the narration of the text, that sheet could be easily cancelled, and an Appendix formed proper to confirm an opposite account. If you still persist in your opinion, somebody else whom you trusted, might be employed to find the proper passages; for I cannot find them.</p><p>There is only one passage which looks like your opinion, and which I shall transcribe to you. It is a relation of what passed between James and Courcelles upon the first rumour of the discovery of Babington's conspiracy before James apprehended his mother to be in any danger. ‘The King said he loved his mother as much as nature and duty bound him; but he could not love her . . .: for he knew well she bore him no more goodwill than she did to the Queen of England: that he had seen with his own eyes before Foulnaye's departure out of Scotland a letter to him, whereby she sent him word, that if he would not conform himself to her will, and follow her counsels and advice, that he should content himself with the Lordship of Darnley, which was all that appertained unto him by his father: farther, that he had seen other letters under her own hand, confirming her evil towards him: besides, that she had oftentimes gone about to make a regency in Scotland, and to put him besides the Crown; that it behoved him to think of his own affairs, and that he thought the Queen of England would attempt nothing against her person without making him acquainted: that his mother was henceforward to carry herself towards him and the Queen of England after another sort, without bending any more upon such practices and intelligences as she had in former times: that he hoped to set such persons about her as . . .’ (Here the manuscript is not farther legible.) But tho such were James's sentiments before he apprehended his mother to be in danger, he adopted a directly opposite conduct afterwards, as I told you.<span class="linelast">I can only express my wishes that you may see reason to conform your narrative in vol. ii pp. 139, 140 to this account, or omit that Appendix altogether, or find some other person who can better execute your intentions than it is possible for me to do.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010287a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span></span></p></div>
