	<div id="humedaOU0010022a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Rheims</span>, <span class="date">Septr. 12, 1734. N.S.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p>I remember when I came from Bristol you desir'd me to inform you of my Travels in France, &amp; particularly of the Place in which I settled, because you had yourself a design of coming thither, for Study &amp; Diversion. If I had met with any thing very curious before this, I wou'd have been sure to inform you of it; but as every thing has happen'd in the ordinary Course of Nature; that the Sun has set &amp; risen again, &amp; that I have gone to Bed, &amp; risen a little after him, with other particulars of the same kind, which are common to Travellers with others, I thought I cou'd spare you the trouble of reading a Letter, which cou'd contain nothing more valuable. But now since I am settled at Rheims in Champaign, which I think wou'd be a place to your Mind, I shall now give you a Description of it, &amp; an Account of my Adventures, since I parted from you.</p><p>Rheims is a very famous &amp; antient Town &amp; University, situated about 34 Leagues from Paris, which makes an easy days Journey by Post. It is a large Town, containing as they say about 40,000 people; but its Buildings are not very beautiful; which proceeds from this, that the People of Fashion choose to build their Houses off the Streets, &amp; by that means they are conceal'd. There are about 30 Families that keep Coaches, tho' as they tell me there is not one of 500£ a year in the whole Town. They are a polite Sociable People, &amp; what is of considerable Advantage to a Stranger, are easily made acquainted with. For having got Letters of Recommendation to two of the best Families in Town, I am every Day in some of their Houses, they make Parties of Diversion to show me more Company, &amp; if I cou'd but speak their Language perfectly I wou'd immediately be acquainted with the whole Town. But that is a Difficulty, which will soon be got over; so that when you come, I shall have the Satisfaction of showing you the best Company in Town.</p><p>These Letters I got from the Chevalier Ramsay, who receiv'd me when I was in Paris with all imaginable Kindness. I have another Letter from him, which I have not yet deliver'd because the Gentleman is not at present in Town, tho' he will return in a few days. He is a man of considerable Note, &amp; as the Chevalier told me, one of the most learned in France. I promise myself abundance of Pleasure from his Conversation. I must likewise add, that he has a fine Library, so that we shall have all Advantages for Study.</p><p>As I know you understand French, I shall copy what the famous Fontaine says of Rheims.</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText">Il n'est Citè que je prefere a Rheims: <br />c'est l'ornement &amp; l'honneur de la France: <br />Car sans compter &amp; l'Ampoule &amp; les bons vins, <br />Charmans objets y sont en abondance. <br />Par ce point-la je n'entends quant a moi <br />Tours ni porteaux; mais gentiles Galoises; <br />Ayant trouvè telle de nos Remoises <br />Friande assez pour la bouche d'un Roi<span href="/item/humedaOU0010022a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p></div><p>This I know will be a great Encouragement to you. I hope you'll b[e so good]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010022a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> as to give me a Letter in any Case; but if you have any thoughts of coming I shall write you an exact account of the Method of Travelling to Paris &amp; shall meet you there.</p><p class="signoff">I remain dear Jemmy <br />Your most affectionate Friend &amp; humble Servt <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><div class="postscript"><p>Will Younge<span href="/item/humedaOU0010022a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> will give you my Direction. I forgot to mention that I think we cannot live under 80£ a year,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010022a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp; that may do.
