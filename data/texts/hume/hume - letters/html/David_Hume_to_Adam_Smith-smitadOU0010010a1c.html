	<div id="smitadOU0010010a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">27 Feb. 1754</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></p><p>I am writing kind of circular Letters, recommending Mr Blacklock's<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Poems<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> [to]<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> all my Acquaintance, but especially to those, whose Approbation<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> wou'd contribute most to recommend them [to] the World. They are, indeed, many of them very elegant, and wou'd have deserv'd much Esteem, had [t]hey come from a Man plac'd in the most favorable Circumstances. What a Prodigy are they, when considerd as the Production of a man, so cruelly dealt with, both by Nature [and] Fortune? When you add to this, that the Author is a Man of the best Dispositions, that I have ever known, and tho' of great Frugality, is plac'd in the most cruel Indigence, you will certainly think his Case more deserving of Pity and Regard than any you have almost met with. Mr Foulis<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> has Copies to dispose of, which I have sent him; and which he will disperse without expecting any Profit. I must entreat you, not only to take a Copy yourself, but also to take a few more and [dis]pose of among your Acquaintance. I trust at least to have half a dozen disposed of by your [me]ans. I have sold off about fifty in a few days. The Price is three Shillings. That you may [rec]ommend them with a safer Conscience, please read the Ode to a young Gentleman going to the Coast of Guinea, that on Refinements in metaphysical Philosophy, that to a Lady on the Death of her Son; the Wish, an Elegy; the Soliloquy. I am much mistaken, if you do not find all these [v]ery laudable Performances; and such as wou'd be esteem'd an Ornament to Dodesley's Miscellanies [o]r even to better Collections.<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p><p>We expected to have seen you in Town about this time; but have been dissappointed. I am [v]ery glad your Health has been so well confirmd this Winter, as I hear it has been. My Compliments to Mr and Mrs Betham.<span href="/item/smitadOU0010010a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> If that Lady can be engag'd to have an Esteem of Mr Blacklock's Productions, she wou'd be of great Service in dispersing them. Tho born blin[d], he is not insensible to that Passion, which we foolish People are apt to receive first by th[e] Eyes; and unless a man were both blind and deaf, I do not know how he cou'd be altogether secure of Impressions from Mrs Betham. I am Dear Sir</p><p class="signoff">Yours sincerely <br /><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p></div>
