	<div id="humedaOU0010465a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I do not know whether I can heartily congratulate you on your withdrawing so much from Business.</span> I shall wait till you have had a twelvemonths Experience of your new Scene of Life. Your plan for passing your time seems very agreeable both for Health and Amusement; and as you reserve still a share in Business, you are not likely to fall into absolute Inactivity, which, after a Life of such Industry, woud not probably have suited your Temper. But you have had before your Eyes so many Examples of industrious Men, who have quitted Business from a fond Love of Ease, and have tir'd of Ease from their former Habits of Business, that you are not likely to fall into the same Error.</p><p>It is certain, that nothing cou'd be a greater Inducement to me to continue my History, than your desiring so earnestly I shoud do so. I have so great Reason to be satisfyd with your Conduct towards me, that I wish very much to gratify you in every thing that is practicable; and there want not other Motives to make me embrace that Resolution. For tho' I think I have Reason to complain of the Blindness of Party, which has made the Public do Justice to me very slowly and with great Reluctance, yet I find, that I obtain support from many impartial People, and hope, that I shall every day have more reason to be satisfy'd in that particular. But in my present Situation, it is impossible for me to undertake such a Work; and I cannot break off from Lord Hertford, as long as he is pleas'd to think me useful to him. I shall not however lose sight of this Object, and any materials, that cast up in this Country, shall be carefully collected by me.</p><p>I am glad you are satisfy'd with the publication of the new Edition of my Essays.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010465a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I shall be oblig'd to you, if you will inform yourself exactly how many Copies are now sold both of that Edition and of the Octavo Edition of my History. I think both these Editions very correct.</p><p>I did little more than see your Friends, Mr Buchannan<span href="/item/humedaOU0010465a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> &amp; Mr Wilson,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010465a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> at Paris, and present them to Lord Hertford: We returnd not from Compiegne till a few days before they left Paris. I am sorry that I am oblig'd to return this other Copy of Coke's Institutes:<span href="/item/humedaOU0010465a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> It is all in the Saxon Character which no body can read in France. I woud not have you send any other Copy.</p><p>Rouet has not yet arrivd at Paris, tho' we expect him every day. I hear good things said of his Pupil Lord Hope, which gives me Pleasure. I am glad that Rouet will have Credit by him. I think the Dutchess of Douglas has chosen well in making Mallet one of her Commissioners. I have no good Opinion of that Cause. Mrs Mallet has retir'd into the Forrest of Fontainebleau with a Macgregor. I fancy she is angry with me, and thought herself neglected by me while in Paris. I heard of her thrusting herself every where into Companies, who endeavourd to avoid her; and I was afraid she woud have laid hold of me to enlarge her Acquaintance among the French.</p><p>I have not yet executed your Commission with Mons<sup>r</sup> le Roy;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010465a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> but shall not forget it.</p><p>I am very glad that Mrs Millar is so good as to remember me. I shall regard it as one agreeable Circumstance, attending my return to England, that you &amp; she will have Leizure to give more of your Company to your Friends; and I shall always be proud to be rankd in the Number.</p><p>The lowness of Stocks surely proceeds not from any Apprehension of War: Never was a general Peace establishd in Europe with more Likelihood of its Continuance: But I fancy your Stocks are become at last too weighty, to the Conviction of all the World: What must happen, if we go on at the same Rate, during another War? I am with great Sincerity</p><p> <span class="linelast">Dear Sir <br />Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">3d Septr 1764</span></p></div>
