I must here have Recourse to your Friendship, of which I have had such sensible Experience, both to excuse this Part of my Conduct, and to express to My Lord my full Sense of his Lordships Goodness. I have us'd the Freedom to write to him,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030064a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> but I have not employd the Terms, which give myself Satisfaction on that head, and therefore look for your Assistance to supply my Defects. Surely nothing could be more amiable, more free, more easy, than my Lord's Commerce and Society: Nothing could open better Prospects than the cultivating his Friendship:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030064a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> But these Considerations lose their Influence on a Recluse and an Ascetic, who retains no Ambition, who has lost his Relish for Pleasure, and who is becoming every day unqualify'd for any Pursuit but Sauntering &amp; Study &amp; Indolence. Can the natural Ardour of your Temper allow you to conceive this State of Mind? If it does, make Allowances for it; and believe me, that among the other Advantages, which I renounce by leaving London, your Company is not the one which I shall regreat the least.</p><p>I find our Friend Barré's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030064a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Deportment yesterday<span href="/item/humedaOU0030064a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> variously descanted on; but the Majority of those I have met with, give it high Commendations. It is certain, that Pitt was confounded; many believe that he will henceforth become a very civil tractable Fellow; some think, that he will appear very little again in the House of Commons. I beg my Compliments to the Man after God's own heart, who has thus struck this Goliah. I am My Dear Clerk</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"> <span class="date">Saturday Evening</span></p></div>
