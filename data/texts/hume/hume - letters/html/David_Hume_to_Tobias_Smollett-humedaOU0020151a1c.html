For of all our annual confusions, the present seems to be the most violent, and to threaten the most entire revolution, and the most important events. As Lord Chatham's state of health appears totally desperate, and as Lord Shelburne's connexion is supposed to be chiefly, if not solely, with him, many people foretell a short duration to the greatness of the last-named minister. Every thing is uncertain: there is a mighty combination to overpower the King. The force of the Crown is great; but is not employed with that steadiness which its friends would wish. I pretend not to foresee, much less to foretell, the consequences.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Sir, <br />Your most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
