	<div id="humedaOU0020252a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have called on Dr Millar<span href="/item/humedaOU0020252a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and he on me; but have never met with him, because tho' this place be not large, I live in a manner out of Town, and am very seldom in it.</span> My Sister also has been dangerously ill of late, which has kept me more out of Company. But I am told by a Friend, that Dr Millar said to him, there was a Bookseller in London, who had advertisd a new Book, containing, among other things, two of my suppress'd Essays.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020252a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> These I suppose are two Essays of mine, one on Suicide another on the Immortality of the Soul, which were printed by Andrew Millar about seventeen Years ago, and which from my abundant Prudence I suppress'd and woud not now wish to have revivd. I know not if you were acquainted with this Transaction. It was this: I intended to print four Dissertations, the natural History of Religion, on the Passions, on Tragedy, and on the metaphisical Principles of Geometry. I sent them up to Mr Millar; but before the last was printed, I happend to meet with Lord Stanhope,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020252a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> who was in this Country, and he convincd me, that either there was some Defect in the Argument or in its perspicuity; I forget which; and I wrote to Mr Millar, that I woud not print that Essay; but upon his remonstrating that the other Essays woud not make a Volume, I sent him up these two, which I had never intended to have publishd. They were printed; but it was no sooner done than I repented; and Mr Millar and I agreed to suppress them at common Charges, and I wrote a new Essay on the Standard of Taste, to supply their place. Mr Millar assurd me very earnestly that all the Copies were suppress'd, except one which he sent to Sir Andrew Mitchell, in whose Custody I thought it safe. But I have since found that there either was some Infidelity or Negligence in the case; For on Mr Morehead's<span href="/item/humedaOU0020252a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Death, there was found a Copy, which his Nephew deliverd up to me.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020252a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> But there have other Copies got abroad; and from one of these, some rascally Bookseller is, it seems, printing this Edition. I am not extremely alarmd at this Event, but if threatening him woud prevent it, I woud willingly employ that means. I am afraid all will be in vain; but if you know him, be as good as try what can be done; and also learn from what hand he had the Copy. I believe an Injunction in Chancery might be got against him; but then I must acknowledge myself the Author and this Expedient woud make a Noise and render the Affair more public. In a post or two, I may perhaps get you more particular Intelligence of the Booksellers Name.</p><p>I am extremely obligd to you for the Pains you take about correcting my Sheets; and you see that I almost always profit by it.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"> <span class="date">Jany 25, 1772.</span></p></div>
