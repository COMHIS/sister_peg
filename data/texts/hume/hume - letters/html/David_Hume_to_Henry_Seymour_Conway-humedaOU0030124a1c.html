But the Duke of Praslin told me to day, that the Offices, to which that Matter was refer'd, cou'd not have their Reply ready, till the End of this Week; and as M. de Guerchy wou'd set out soon after, it was propos'd to give him full Powers and Instructions to settle finally that Dispute, which had been drawn out to such a Length of Negotiation.</span></p><p>M. de Praslin complain'd to me of an English Sloop that had enter'd the Harbour of St Pierre's, and had fird upon the Houses. He said, that the Governor of St Pierre's, had complaind to Capt. Paliser<span href="/item/humedaOU0030124a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> of this Outrage; but it was not known what Answer he had receivd.</p><p>The Duke also complaind to me, in the strongest Terms, of the Insolence, as he term'd it, of some Expressions in Capt. Paliser's Letters to the Governor of St. Pierre. The Duke of Choiseul enterd the Room, while M de Praslin was engag'd on this Subject. He repeated to me the same Complaint, with still greater Warmth. Both these Ministers told me, that M. de Blosset was instructed to lay these Complaints before your Excellency.</p><p>The Dauphin seems to be a little recover'd, since his Arrival at Fontainebleau.
