	<div id="rousjeVF0280112a1c"><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>[. . .] I must however be in London very soon, in order to give an Account of my Commission, to thank the King for his Goodness to me, and to settle the celebrated Rousseau, who has rejected Invitations from half of the Kings and Princes of Europe, in order to put himself under my Protection. He has been at Paris about twelve<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> days; and lives in an Apartment prepared for him by the Prince of Conti, which he says gives him Uneasyness by reason of its Magnificence. As he was outlawd by the Parliament, it behov'd him to have the King's Pass-port, which was at first offerd him under<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> a feignd Name, but his Friends refusd it, because they knew, that he woud not submit even to that Falshood. You have heard that he was banishd from Neuf-chatel by Preachers, who excited the Mob to stone him. He told me, that a Trap was laid for him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> with as much Art as ever was employ'd against a Fox or a Poll cat. In the night time a great enormous Stone was suspended above his Door, in such a manner that in opening it in the Morning the Stone must have fallen, and have crushd him to Death. A man passing bye early perceivd it, and calld in to him at the Window to be on his Guard. He also told me, that last Spring, when he went about the Mountains, amusing himself with Botany, he came to a Village at some Distance from his own: A Woman met him; who, surpriz'd at his Armenian Dress (for he <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> wears and<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> is resolvd to wear that Habit during Life) ask'd him what he was and what was his Name. On hearing it, she exclaimed; Are you that impious Rascal, Rousseau: Had I known it, I should have waited for you at the End of the Wood with a Pistol in order to blow out your Brains. He added<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span>, that all the Women in Switzerland were in the same Dispositions; because the Preachers had told them, that he had wrote Books to prove that Women had no Souls. He then turned to M<sup>de</sup> de Boufflers, who was present, and said, Is it not strange, that I, who have wrote so much to decry the Morals and Conduct of the Parisian Ladies, shoud yet be belov'd by them: While the Swiss Women, whom I have so much extolld, would willingly cut my Throat. We are fond of you, reply'd she, because we know, that, however you might rail, you are, at the bottom, fond <em>of us</em> to Distraction: But the Swiss Women hate you<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>; because they are conscious that they have not merit to deserve your Attention.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>On leaving Neuf-chatel, he took Shelter in a little Island, about half a League in Circumference, in the midst of a Lake near Berne. There livd in it <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> only one German<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> Peasant with his Wife and Sister: The Council of Berne, frightend for his Neighbourhood, on account of his democratical, more than his religious Principles, ordered him immediatly to withdraw from their State. He wrote the Letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> of which I send you a Copy, as it is very curious. The Council <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> in Answer<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> re-iterated their Orders for him to be gone. He then apply'd to me: I have made an Agreement with a French Gardener in <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> Fulham for boarding him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. We set out together in <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> a few<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> days.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>It is impossible to express or imagine the Enthusiasm of this Nation in his favour. As I am suppos'd to have him in my Custody, all the World, especially the great Ladies teaze me to be introduc'd to him: I have had Rouleaus<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> thrust into my hand, with earnest Applications, that I would prevail on him to accept of them. I am perswaded, that were I to open here<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> a Subscription with his Consent, I should receive 50,000 Pounds in a fortnight. The second day after his Arrival, he slipt out early in the Morning to take a Walk in the Luxembourg Gardens. The thing was known soon after: I am strongly sollicited to prevail on him to take another Walk, and <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> then to<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> give warning to my Friends: Were the Public to be informd, he coud not failt to have <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> many thousand<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> Spectators. People may talk of antient Greece <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> as they please<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>, but no Nation was ever so fond of Genius as this; and no Person ever so much engag'd their Attention <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> as Rousseau<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>. Voltaire and every body else, are quite eclipsd by him. I am sensible, that my Connexions with him, add to my Importance at present. Even his Maid, <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> La Vasseur<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>, who is very homely and very awkward, is more talkd of than the Princess of Monaco<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> or the Countess of Egmont<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, on account of her Fidelity <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> and Attachment<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> towards him. <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/010" title="j [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span> His very Dog, who is no better than a Coly, has a Name and Reputation in the World<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/010" title="j [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>As to my Intercourse with him, I find him mild, and gentle and modest and good humourd; and he has more the Behaviour of a Man of the World than any of the Learned here, except M. de Buffon who in his Figure and Air and Deportment answers<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/011" title="k [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_txt">k</span> your Idea of a Mareschal of France rather<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> than that of a Philosopher. M. Rousseau is of small Stature<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/012" title="l [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_txt">l</span>, and wou'd rather be ugly, had he not the finest Physiognomony<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/013" title="m [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_txt">m</span> in the World, I mean, the most expressive<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/014" title="n [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_txt">n</span> Countenance. His Modesty seems not to be good Manners; but Ignorance of his own Excellence: As he writes and speaks and acts from the Impulse of Genius, more than from the Use of his ordinary Faculties, it is very likely that he forgets its Force, whenever it is laid asleep. I am well assurd, that at times he believes he has Inspirations from an immediate Communication with the Divinity; He falls sometimes into Ecstacies which retain him in the same Posture for Hours together. Does not this Example solve the Difficulty of Socrates's Genius and of his Ecstacies? I think Rousseau in many things very much resembles Socrates: The Philosopher of Geneva <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/015" title="o [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_txt">o</span> seems only<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/015" title="o [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_txt">o</span> to have more Genius than he<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/016" title="p [marked '16' in source]" class="notecall_txt">p</span> of Athens, who never wrote any thing; and less Sociableness and Temper, Both of them <span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/017" title="q [marked '17' in source]" class="notecall_txt">q</span> were of<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/017" title="q [marked '17' in source]" class="notecall_txt">q</span> very amorous Complexions<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/018" title="r [marked '18' in source]" class="notecall_txt">r</span>: But a Comparison in this particular turns out much<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/019" title="s [marked '19' in source]" class="notecall_txt">s</span> to the Advantage of my Friend: I call him such; for I hear from all hands that his Judgement and Affections are as strongly byass'd in my favour as mine are in his: I shall much regreat the leaving him in England: But even if a Pardon cou'd be procur'd for him here, he is resolvd, as he tells me, never to return; because he never will again be in the Power of any man. I wish he may live unmolested in England: I dread the Bigotry and Barbarism which prevail there.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>When he came to Paris, he seem'd resolv'd to stay till the 6<sup>t</sup> or 7<sup>t</sup> of next Month: But at present the Concourse about him gives him so much Uneasiness, that he expresses the utmost Impatience to be gone. Many People here will have it, that this solitary Humour is all Affectation, in order to be more sought after; but I am sure that it is natural and unsurmountable. I know, that two very agreeable Ladies breaking in upon him, discomposd him so much, that he was not able to eat his dinner afterwards. He is short sighted; and I have often observd, that while he was conversing with me in the outmost good humour (for he is naturally gay) if he heard the Door open, the greatest<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/020" title="t [marked '20' in source]" class="notecall_txt">t</span> Agony appeard on his Countenance, from the Apprehension of a Visit, and his Distress did not leave him, unless the Person was a particular Friend. His Armenian Dress is not affectation. He has had an Infirmity from his Infancy, which makes Breeches inconvenient for him; and he told me, that when he was chacd into the Mountains of Switzerland he took up this new Dress, as it<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/021" title="u [marked '21' in source]" class="notecall_txt">u</span> seemed indifferent what Habit he there wore. I coud fill a Volume with curious<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Anecdotes regarding him, as I live in the same Society which he frequented while in Paris: But I must not exhaust your Patience. My kind Compliments to Ferguson<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>, Robertson<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280112a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>, &amp; all the Brethren.
