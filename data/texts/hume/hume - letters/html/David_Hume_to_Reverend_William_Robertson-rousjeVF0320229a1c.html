	<div id="rousjeVF0320229a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="date">19 March, 1767.</span></p><p>. . . A few days before my arrival in London, Mr Davenport had carried to Mr Conway a letter of Rousseau's<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320229a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, in which that philosopher says, that he had never meant to refuse the King's bounty, that he would be proud of accepting it, but that he would owe it entirely to His Majesty's generosity and that of his Ministers, and would refuse it if it came through any other canal whatsoever, even that of Mr Davenport<span href="/item/rousjeVF0320229a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. Mr Davenport then addressed himself to Mr Conway, and asked whether it was not possible to recover what this man's madness had thrown away? The Secretary replied, that I should be in London in a few days, and that he would take no steps in the affair but at my desire and with my approbation. When the matter was proposed to me, I exhorted the General to do this act of charity to a man of genius, however wild and extravagant. The King, when applied to, said, that since the pension had once been promised, it should be granted notwithstanding all that had passed in the interval. And thus the affair is happily finished, unless some new extravagance come across the philosopher, and engage him to reject what he has anew applied for. If he knew my situation with General Conway he probably would; for he must then conjecture that the affair could not be done without my consent. . . .</p></div>
