	<div id="humedaOU0020160a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">13 of August 1767.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir Gilbert</p><p><span class="linefirst">I am told that the Minister of Kirkton, in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, is either dying, or is to be remov'd, and that the Living is in the Gift of the Crown.</span> I have spoke to General Conway desiring that, in case no unexpected Difficulties occur, he may give it to my Nephew's Tutor; and he has agreed to it. I have since heard, that the Living, tho‘ it stands in our List as a Crown Presentation, is alternately in the Gift of Sir John Elliot of Stobs,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020160a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and Cavers Douglas.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020160a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I shall be much obligd to you, if, without mentioning the Reason, you coud make Enquiries and give me Information.</p><p>You have heard, no doubt, that all our Negotiations have vanishd, and that our present Ministry is settled on a firmer Basis than ever. Mr Conway's Delicacy of Honour was satisfy'd, by bringing his old Friends, the Rockinghams, to have an Offer; and as it was impossible for them to concert a Ministry, he has agreed to act cordially with the Duke of Grafton. The King is very happy that no Changes are to have place. I do not reckon the Change in Ireland for anything, because Lord Bristol<span href="/item/humedaOU0020160a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> goes out at his own earnest and repeated Desire. I am told that Lord Townsend<span href="/item/humedaOU0020160a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> openly ascribes his own Promotion entirely to the Friendship of Lord Bute. Charles Fitzroy<span href="/item/humedaOU0020160a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> lately, in a great Meeting, proposd Lord Bute's Health in a Bumper. It will be no Surprize to you certainly, if that noble Lord shoud again come into Fashion, and openly avow his Share of Influence, and be openly courted by all the World. I am Dear Sir Gilbert</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
