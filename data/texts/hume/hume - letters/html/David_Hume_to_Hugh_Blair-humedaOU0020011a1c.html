	<div id="humedaOU0020011a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have perus'd Ferguson's Papers<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> more than once, which had been put into my hands, some time ago, at his desire.</span> I sat down to read them with great Prepossession, founded on my good Opinion of him, on a Small Specimen I had seen of them some Years ago, and on yours &amp; Dr Robertson's Esteem of them: But I am sorry to say it, they have no-wise answer'd my Expectation. I do not think them fit to be given to the Public, neither on account of the Style nor the Reasoning; the Form nor the Matter. My Concern for his Reputation obliges me to tell you my Opinion; which I find also to be Elliots, as well as Dr Lowthe's,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> a very candid &amp; ingenious Critic. I beseech you and Robertson to give them another Perusal, with more Severity and less Prepossession. This is a very serious Matter: Any Failure of Success in this particular, besides the Mortification attending it, operates backwards, and discredits his Class, which is at present in so flourishing a Situation. He has not wrote a word to me about the Subject, so that I cannot with any Propriety give him my Judgement; and I demand of you &amp; Dr Robertson the strictest Secrecy. Remember that you two forc'd out <em>the Siege of Aquileia</em><span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> upon the Public, in spite of my Judgement. It is not natural to imagine, that these Sections, which he has sent as a Specimen, are the worst parts of the Performance: Yet surely, what I saw was much better. It is needless to enter into a Detail, where almost every thing appears to me exceptionable. If I come down to Scotland next Summer, I shoud concur in any Method to prevent or retard the Publication; but they are now put into General Clerk &amp; Lord Shelburne's hands, who are not the most proper Judges in the World; and if you do not interpose, they will certainly be printed. I shall be agreeably disappointed, if the Success prove contrary to my Opinion.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p>I did not answer Yours, which Oswald<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> delivered me; because I take it for granted that you receivd mine, which I wrote from Paris, under Lord Kaims's Cover. You have seen in the News papers enow of Particulars concerning my Pupil, who has now left me and retir'd to Chiswick.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> He is impatient to get into the Mountains of Wales.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> He is a very agreeable, amiable Man; but a great Humourist. The Philosophers of Paris fortold to me, that I coud not conduct him to Calais without a Quarrel;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020011a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> but I think I cou'd live with him all my Life, in mutual Friendship and Esteem. I am very sorry, that the Matter is not likely to be put to a Trial. I believe one great Source of our Concord, is, that neither he nor I are disputatious, which is not the Case with any of them. They are also displeas'd with him, because they think he over-abounds in Religion; and it is indeed remarkable, that the Philosopher of this Age, who has been the most persecuted, is by far the most devout. I do not comprehend such Philosophers as are invested with the sacerdotal Character. <span class="linelast">I am Dear Dr Yours usque ad aras</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Lisle Street</span> <span class="date">11 of Feby 1766</span></p></div>
