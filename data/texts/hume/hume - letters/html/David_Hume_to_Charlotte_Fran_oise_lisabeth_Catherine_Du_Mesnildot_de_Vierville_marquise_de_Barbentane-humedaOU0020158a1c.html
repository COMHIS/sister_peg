	<div id="humedaOU0020158a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">4 of August, 1767.</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">As Lady Tavistoke, Dear Madam, receives no Company, I was obliged to employ Lord Ossory<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> to make Enquiries about M. de Barbantane's Commissions: He told me, that they were found in the House after poor Lord Tavistoke's Death; and no-body knowing what to do with them, they were restored to the Joiner.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></span> Ossory left the Town next day: the Duke and Dutchess of Bedford are in the Country: But as they will come to Town next Month to attend Lady Tavistoke's Lying-in, I shall then endeavour, if possible, to recover these pieces of Furniture, and to find a method of conveying them to Italy; that is, provided you at present desire it. I am happy in the most trifling Occasion to mark my Attachment to you.</p><p>Your present retired Life,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> you say, is not disagreable to you: But do you know, that it is not likely to continue long, and that your Pupil may probably be Empress?<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> If you have not heard of this design before, say not a Word of it to her, or any body else. I hope in God such an Event, shou'd it happen, will not carry you to Vienna, to pass your life there in tiresome State and Dignity. It would be a great Disappointment to me to come to Paris, and find you a thousand Miles distant.</p><p>I believe that M<sup>de</sup> de Verdelin is in the same Convent with you. Please make my Compliments to her. Tell her, that the reason of my not answering her Letter last Summer was, that a Report then prevailed, that Mr Melville, Governor of the Granades,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> was dead; and before that mistake was cleared up, I had left London. But if I can do any thing for her Service at present, she may command me.</p><p>I hope I am not lost altogether to M<sup>de</sup> de Mauri's memory.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> If so, she is very ungrateful.</p><p>You have heard probably that our Ministry was on the Eve of a Revolution. We were so; I thought once that I shou'd have been out of Office in two days: But all is come about again; and we seem to be more settled than ever. I had made a Party with the Chevalier Darcy<span href="/item/humedaOU0020158a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> to pay you a visit at Paris, if I had been an Ex-Minister. That journey would have been sufficient to comfort me from much greater Affliction. <span class="linelast">Believe me to be, Dear Madam, with the most sincere Regard and Attachment, Your most obedient and humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
