	<div id="humedaOU0010094b1c"><p><span class="linefirst">Our first warlike Attempt has been unsuccessful, tho without any Loss or Dishonour.</span> The public Rumour must certainly have inform'd you, that being detain'd in the Channel, till it was too late to go to America,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010094b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> the Ministry, who were willing to make some Advantage of so considerable a sea and land Armament, sent us to seek Adventures on the Coast of France. Tho' both the General<span href="/item/humedaOU0010094b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> and Admiral<span href="/item/humedaOU0010094b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> were totally unacquainted with every part of the Coast, without Pilots, Guides or Intelligence of any kind, &amp; even without the common Maps of the Country; yet being assur'd there were no regular Troops near this whole Coast, they hop'd it was not impossible but something might be successfully undertaken. They bent their Course to Port l'Orient, a fine Town on the Coast of Britanny, the Seat of the French East India Trade, &amp; which about 20 Years ago, was but a mean contemptible Village. The Force of this Town, the Strength of its Garrison, the Nature of the Coast &amp; Country, they profest themselves entirely ignorant of, except from such hear-say Information as they had casually pickt up at Plimouth. However we made a happy Voyage of three days, landed in the Face of about 3000 arm'd Militia in the twentieth of September, march'd up next day to the Gates of l'Orient, and survey'd it.</p><p>It lies at the bottom of a fine Bay two Leagues long, the Mouth of which is commanded by the Town &amp; Cittadel of Port-Louis or Blavet, a Place of great Strength &amp; situated on a Peninsula. The Town of l'Orient itself has no great Strength, tho surrounded by a new wall of about 30 Foot high, fortify'd with half Moons, &amp; guarded with some Cannon. They were in prodigious Alarm at so unexpected an Attack, by Numbers, which their Fears magnify'd; and immediatly offer'd to capitulate, tho' upon Terms, which wou'd have made their Conquest of no Significancy to us. They made some Advances, a few hours after, to abate of their Demands; but the General positively refus'd to accept of the Town on any other Condition than that of surrendring at Discretion. He had very good Reason for this seeming Rigour &amp; Haughtiness. It has long been the Misfortune of English Armies to be very ill serv'd in Enginiers; &amp; surely there never was on any occasion such an Assemblage of ignorant Blockheads as those which at this time attended us. They positively affirm'd it was easily in their Power, by the Assistance of a Mortar &amp; two twelve Pounders, in ten hours time, either to lay the Town &amp; East India Magazine in Ashes, or make a Breach, by which the Forces might easily enter. This being laid before the General &amp; Admiral, they concluded themselves already Masters of the Town, &amp; needed grant no Terms. They were besides afraid, that had they taken the Town upon Terms, &amp; redeem'd it for a considerable Sum of Money, the good People of England, who love Mischief, wou'd not be satisfy'd; but wou'd still entertain a Suspicion, that the Success of his Majesty's Arms had been secretly sold by his Commanders. Besides, nothing cou'd be a greater Blow to the French Trade than the Destruction of this Town, nor what cou'd imprint a stronger Terror of the English Naval Power, &amp; more effectually reduce the French to a Necessity of guarding their Coast with regular Forces, which must produce a great Diversion from their ambitious Projects on the Frontiers. But when the Enginiers came to Execution, it was found they cou'd do nothing of what they had promis'd. Not one of their Carkasses or red hot ball took Effect. As the Town coud not be invested either by sea or land, they got a Garrison of irregulars &amp; regulars, which was above double our Number; &amp; play'd 35 Pieces of Cannon upon us, while we coud bring only four against them. Excessive Rains fell, which brought Sickness amongst our Men, that had been stew'd in Transports during the whole Summer. We were ten Miles from the Fleet, the Roads entirely spoilt; every thing was drawn by Men, the whole Horses in the Country being driven away. So much Fatigue &amp; Duty quite overcame our little Army; The Fleet anchor'd in a very unsafe place in Quimperlay Bay: For these and other Reasons, it was unanimously determin'd to raise the Siege on the 27th of September, &amp; to this Measure, there was not one contradictory Opinion either in the Fleet or Army. We have not lost above ten Men by the Enemy in the whole Expedition, &amp; were not in the least molested either in our Retreat or Reimbarkation. We met with a violent Storm on the first of October, while we were yet very near the Coast; &amp; have now got into Quiberon Bay South of Belle-isle, where we wait for a Re-inforcement of three Battallions from England. There are five or six of our Transports amissing. After our French Projects are over, which must be very soon because of the late Season, we sail to Cork &amp; Kingsale.</p><p>While we lay at Ploemeur, a Village about a League from L'Orient, there happen'd in our Family one of the most tragical Stories ever I heard of, than which nothing ever gave me more Concern. I know not if ever you heard of Major Forbes,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010094b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> a Brother of Sir Arthur's. He was, &amp; was esteem'd a Man of the greatest Sense, Honour, Modesty, Mildness &amp; Equality of Temper in the World. His Learning was very great for a man of any Profession, but a Prodigy for a Soldier. His Bravery had been try'd &amp; was unquestion'd. He had exhausted himself with Fatigue &amp; Hunger for two days; so that he was oblig'd to leave the Camp, &amp; come to our Quarters, where I took the utmost Care of him, as there was a great Friendship betwixt us. He express'd vast Anxiety that he shou'd be oblig'd to leave his Duty, &amp; Fear, least his Honour shoud suffer by it. I endeavourd to quiet his Mind as much as possible, &amp; thought I had left him tolerably compos'd at Night; but returning to his Room early next Morning, I found him with small Remains of Life, wallowing in his own Blood, with the Arteries of his Arm cut asunder. I immediatly sent for a Surgeon, got a Bandage ty'd to his Arm, &amp; recoverd him entirely to his Senses &amp; Understanding. He liv'd above four &amp; twenty hours after, &amp; I had several Conversations with him. Never a man exprest a more steady Contempt of Life nor more determind philosophical Principles, suitable to his Exit. He beg'd of me to unloosen his Bandage &amp; hasten his Death, as the last Act of Friendship I coud show him: But alas! we live not in Greek or Roman times. He told me, that he knew, he coud not live a few Days: But if he did, as soon as he became his own Master, he wou'd take a more expeditious Method, which none of his Friends cou'd prevent. I dye, says he, from a Jealousy of Honour, perhaps too delicate; and do you think, if it were possible for me to live, I woud now consent to it, to be a Gazing-Stock to the foolish World. I am too far advanc'd to return. And if Life was odious to me before, it must be doubly so at present. He became delirious a few Hours before he dy'd. He had wrote a short Letter to his Brother above ten hours before he cut his Arteries. <span class="linelast">This we found on the Table.</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Quiberon Bay in Brittanny.</span> <span class="date">Octr. 4. 1746.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>P.S. The General has not sent off his Dispatches till to day; so that I have an Opportunity of saying a few Words more. Our Army disembark'd on the 4th of October, &amp; took Possession of the Peninsula of Quiberon without Opposition. We lay there without Molestation for eight days, tho the Enemy had form'd a powerful, at least a numerous Army of Militia on the Continent. The Separation of so many of our Transports, &amp; the Reinforcements not coming, determin'd us to re-imbark &amp; return home; with some small hopes, that our Expedition has answerd the chief Part of its intended Purpose, by making a Diversion from the French Army in Flanders. The French pretend to have gain'd a great Victory; but with what Truth we know not. The Admiral landed some Sailors &amp; took Possession of the two Islands of Houat &amp; Hedie which were secur'd by small Forts. The Governor of one of them, when he surrender'd his Fort, deliver'd up his Purse to the Sea Officer, &amp; beg'd him to take care of it, &amp; secure it from the Pillage of the Sailors. The Officer took charge of it, &amp; finding afterwards a proper Opportunity to examine it, found it contain'd the important Sum of ten Sous, which is less than sixpence of our Money.</p><p>Oct<sup>r.</sup> 17th.</p></div></div>
