	<div id="rousjeVF0310113a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">4 of Nov. 1766.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p>Yesterday I received by the post a copy of the edition, printed at Paris, of my narrative of this ridiculous affair between Rousseau and me. There is an introduction in the name of my friends, giving an account of the necessity under which they found themselves to publish this narrative; and an appendix in D'Alembert's name, protesting his innocence with regard to all the imputations thrown on him by Rousseau<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310113a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. I have no objection with regard to the first, but the second contains a clause which displeases me very much, but which you will probably only laugh at: it is that where he blames the King of Prussia's letter as cruel<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310113a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. What could engage D'Alembert to use this freedom, I cannot imagine. Is it possible that a man of his superior parts can bear you ill will because you are the friend of his enemy, Madame du Deffand? What makes me suspect that there may be something true of this suspicion, is, that several passages in my narrative, in which I mention you and that letter, are all altered in the translation, and rendered much less obliging than I wrote them: for my narrative sent to Paris was an exact copy of that left in Lord Hertford's hands. I would give any thing to prevent a publication in London (for surely the whole affair will appear perfectly ridiculous); but I am afraid that a book printed at Paris will be translated in London, if there be hopes of selling a hundred copies of it. For this reason, I fancy it will be better for me to take care that a proper edition be published, in which case I shall give orders that all the passages altered in my narrative shall be restored.</p><p>Since I came here I have been told that you have had a severe fit of sickness, but that you are now recovered: I hope you are perfectly so. I am anxious to hear of your welfare; being with great sincerity,</p><p>Dear Sir,</p><p class="signoff">Your most obedient and most humble servant, <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
