	<div id="humedaOU0010084a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">Saturday.</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I receiv'd by my Lord a letter from Vincent, which he immediately burnt in a passion.</span> The purport of it was this; that he (Vincent) desir'd to see me as soon as possible; that my money was ready for me; and that my attendance on my Lord was no longer necessary, since he did not any longer desire it. I have sent the following answer<span href="/item/humedaOU0010084a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>: —</p><p>Is not this very diverting? I wait your orders. You see to what straits this honest gentleman is reduc'd to find a pretext. But I fancy he must prevail at last; and I shall take care not to be a bone of contention betwixt you, unless you think that I am the most advantageous piece of ground on which you can resist him. <span class="linelast"> I am, dear Sir, yours most sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><div class="postscript"><p>I had a conversation here, which will divert you when I shall have the pleasure of seeing you.</p><p>P.S. Since I wrote the above, my Lord brought me a letter he had wrote to Vincent, wherein he tells him positively that he will be first fixt in a little house and a few servants, after which he will take his resolution with regard to me, and that, till this be done, he will not part with me. This was a very happy thought, and entirely his own. 'Tis the proper means of reducing Vincent to a nonplus, and perhaps of making a compromise with him. I am not now any way impatient or melancholy, but can laugh at all this.</p></div></div>
