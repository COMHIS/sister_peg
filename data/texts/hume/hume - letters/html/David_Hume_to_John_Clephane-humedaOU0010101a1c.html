	<div id="humedaOU0010101a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">All our projects have failed, and, I believe, for ever.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> The Secretary-at-War<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> persists in his scruples and delays; and Mr Robarts, Pelham's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Secretary, says our applications will not succeed. I suppose he speaks in this the sense of his master. Mentor<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> alone is positive we will infallibly succeed. The General<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> goes off for Scotland to-morrow. I set out next week, as fully convinced as Seneca of the vanity of the world, and of the insufficiency of riches to render us happy. I wish you had a little more of the philosophy of that great man, and I a little more of his riches. Perhaps you would rather choose my share, and will reproach me with both dividing and choosing. But such a sentiment is the strongest proof in the world that you want a little more philosophy, and that the division I have assigned you would suit you best.</p><p>The General made . . . effort for us, and would have made a stronger could he have met with Lord Sandwich,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> whom he called upon several times, and who is now gone to the country about elections. Your friend Mitchel<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> stands for Aberdeenshire, and, I believe, will carry it. I hope Col. Erskine<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> will also have a seat. I am afraid for Oswald.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span></p><p>I could have wrote you a fine elaborate letter, which you might have shown as from a wit of your acquaintance; but being afraid that this would deter you from answering, I thought it better to scribble in this careless manner. Pray how do you like your situation in Flanders?<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> Have you got any friends or confidents whom you can be free with <em>in seriis et in jocis, — amici omnium horarum</em>?</p><p>If Cope's dragoons be in Flanders, pray inquire out the surgeon, Frank Home,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010101a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> and make my compliments to him, and tell him that I recommend him to pay his court to you, and to acquire your friendship. You may say that I think it will be very well worth his while, even though it should cost him some pains both to acquire and to keep it. You may add, that the last is, in my opinion, the most difficult point. Seriously speaking, Frank Home is a very pretty young fellow, and well worth your acquaintance. So pray make him the first advances, in case his modesty should render him backward.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">June 18, 1747</span></p></div>
