They still insist, however, that as that Arret was fram'd without consulting the Court of England, it is liable to great Objections, and exposes them <del>and their</del> to great Injustice. They insist that all the Paper Money of Canada ought to have been pay'd in full, <del>both</del> because the Faith of the French Government is doubly plighted to that purpose both by their original Engagements in Canada, and by the strong Declaration annexd to the late Treaty.</p><p>They insist, that, even if a Reduction was to have place, the <del>Liquidation of 50</del> payment of 50 per cent for the Bills of Exchange preceding <del>17</del> Oct<sup>r</sup> 1759 was too low, as well as that of 25 per cent for the Cards &amp; Billets of Ordonnance; because there was so considerable a Difference made between Paper and Money in Canada.</p><p>Allowing, that such a Difference had been made in Canada; /during the years 1759 &amp; 1760/<span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/001" title="a [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> yet as the Arret of the French /Court/<span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/001" title="a [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> was not issud till July 1764, the Proprietors of the Paper Money had been great Losers, by so late a Payment.</p><p><span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/002" title="b [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>This Hardship is greatly aggravated by the Terms of Payment: The very 25 per cent granted them cannot be disposd of but at 35 or 36 per cent Discount, <del>which is a palpable</del> a Circumstance, which the Court of France itself, reasoning upon its own Principles, must allow to be a great Hardship &amp; Injustice.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/002" title="b [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span></p><p>For all these Reasons, the English Merchants insist that /besides <del>over and above</del> the Payments requird as above/<span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/001" title="a [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> the Sum of 120.000 Pounds Sterling shall be pay'd them in four quarterly Payments as a Reparation of their Losses. <span href="/item/humedaOU0020405a1d/txt/002" title="b [not marked in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>| This Sum is proposed to be distributed among the Proprietors of the Cards &amp; Billets d Ordonnance.
