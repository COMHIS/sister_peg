As I had got the <em>Original</em> &amp; advertised a <em>translation</em> he thought me every way intitled to it.

Particular care is taken with respect to the translation — and the translator has given Notes here &amp; there that is necessary — especially one relating to the Charge of R's about your <em>suppressing</em> the publication of the Letters of Mons. Perou<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310145a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> which we have entirely overthrown &amp; the world will see you are innocent of his <em>false</em> charge — This Note I particularly desire &amp; I am sure y<sup>e</sup> will be pleased with it. In whatever view M<sup>r</sup> R may see this, I care not, for I will ascertain facts where I can. M<sup>r</sup> Suard told me he made no doubt but y<sup>e</sup> would send me a Copy for publication, being he thought the properest midwife in this Case.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>As y<sup>e</sup> had desired M<sup>r</sup> Strahan to send a Copy<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310145a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> to L<sup>d</sup> Hartford<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310145a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> M<sup>r</sup> Conway — M<sup>r</sup> Walpole and Lady Hervey<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310145a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> — he thought I had better send them from mine, which I did, &amp; also 5 to you at Edin[burgh] by the Waggon, W<sup>₶</sup> went Monday sen'night<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310145a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked 'k' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>.
