	<div id="rousjeVF0280307a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Lisle Street</span>, Leicester Fields, <span class="date">16 of Feb. 1766</span></p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>You have sometimes, dear Madam, been embarassed between opposite opinions, with regard to the personal character of M. Rousseau: his enemies have sometimes made you doubt of his sincerity; and you have been pleased to ask my opinion on this head. After having lived so long with him, and seen him in a variety of lights, I am now better enabled to judge; and I declare to you, that I have never known a man more amiable and more virtuous than he appears to me: he is mild, gentle, modest, affectionate, disinterested; and, above all, endowed with a sensibility of heart in a supreme degree. Were I to seek for his faults, I should say, that they consisted in a little hasty impatience, which, as I am told, inclines him sometimes to say disobliging things to people that trouble him: he is also too delicate in the commerce of life: he is apt to entertain groundless suspicions of his best friends; and his lively imagination, working upon them, feigns chimeras, and pushes him to great extremes. I have seen no instance of this disposition; but I cannot otherwise account for the violent animosities which have arisen between him and several men of merit, with whom he was once intimately connected; and some who love him much have told me, that it is difficult to live much with him, and preserve his friendship; but for my part, I think I could pass all my life in his company, without any danger of our quarrelling.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>There is one circumstance, that renders him very amiable, and may serve to abate the envy arising from his superior parts; which is, that he is endowed with a singular simplicity of manners, and is, indeed, a perfect child in the ordinary occurrences of life. This quality, joined to his great sensibility of heart, makes him be easily governed by those who live with him; and his maid, in particular, has an uncontrolled authority over him. Shall I give you an instance? He showed me the letter which he had received from the Corsicans, in which he is invited to come among them, to frame them a body of laws, and to be the Solon or Lycurgus of this new commonwealth. He told me, that he had once intended to comply with this invitation, but, on consulting Mademoiselle Le Vasseur, he found she did not approve of the journey; upon which he laid aside all thoughts of it. His dog also has great influence with him; of which I shall give you an instance that may amuse you. Soon after our arrival, I prevailed on him to go to the playhouse, and see Garrick<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>. Mrs Garrick gave him her box, which is much concealed from the audience, but opposite to that of the King and Queen; and their Majesties were privately informed, that they might there expect to see M. Rousseau. When the hour came, he told me, that he had changed his resolution, and would not go: for — what shall I do with Sultan? That is the name of his dog. You must leave him behind, said I. But the first person, replied he, who opens the door, Sultan will run into the streets in search of me, and will be lost. You must then, said I, lock him up in your room, and put the key in your pocket. This was accordingly done: but as we went downstairs, the dog howled and made a noise; his master turned back, and said he had not resolution to leave him in that condition; but I caught him in my arms and told him, that Mrs Garrick had dismissed another company in order to make room for him; that the King and Queen were expecting to see him; and without a better reason than Sultan's impatience, it would be ridiculous to disappoint them. Partly by these reasons and partly by force, I engaged him to proceed. The King and Queen looked more at him than at the players.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>When I have proposed to him schemes for enriching him, he has told me, that he dreads the inconvenience of changing his manner of life; particularly, said he, I should be tempted, if I were richer, to take another servant, which, I know, is taking another master; and I should in that case have my will in nothing.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>The public here has taken a great interest in M. Rousseau; and though we are now in the hottest time of our hottest factions, he is not forgot. Every circumstance, the most minute, that concerns him, is put in the newspapers. Unfortunately, one day, he lost his dog: this incident was in the papers next morning<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. Soon after, I recovered Sultan very surprizingly: this intelligence was communicated to the public immediately, as a piece of good news. Hundreds of persons have offered me their assistance to settle him; you would think that all the purses and all the houses of England were open to him. Did he understand the language, he would live very happily in this country. He is particularly pleased that no body makes him speeches or compliments.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>What has chiefly begot a doubt of his sincerity, are his great singularities, which some people take for affectation, and an art to gain celebrity: but his greatest singularity is the love of solitude, which, in a man so well calculated for the entertainment of company, and seemingly so sociable, appears very extraordinary. I can however answer for his sincerity in this particular. He would not stay in London above a fortnight. I settled him in a village about six miles from it: he is impatient to remove from thence, though the place and the house are both very agreeable to him; and, of a great variety of schemes which I propose to him, the most solitary, the most remote, the most savage place is always that which he prefers. In a few weeks he will certainly remove to Wales, and will board with a substantial farmer, who inhabits a lonely house amid forests and rivulets, and rocks and mountains. I have endeavoured to throw a hundred obstacles in the way, but nothing can divert him; his obstinacy is here an invincible proof of his sincerity. I must, however, confess, that I think he has an inclination to complain of his health, more than I imagine he has reason for: he is not insincere, but fanciful, in that particular. I know not how your enquiries with regard to M. Rougemont have turned out<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 6]</span></p><p>Please tell Madame de Boufflers that I received her letter the day after I wrote mine. Assure her that Horace Walpole's letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> was not founded on any pleasantry of mine: the only pleasantry in that letter came from his own mouth, in my company, at Lord Ossory's<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> table; which my Lord remembers very well. Tell her also that I like Mademoiselle Le Vasseur, upon acquaintance. She appears to me a good creature, more clever than she had been represented. She is only somewhat of a gossip, or what you call <em>une commère</em>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 7]</span></p><p>Thus, dear Madam I have wrote you a long letter concerning a third person; and have left myself neither room nor leisure to say any thing either of you or of myself. I must therefore be the more concise on that head. What can I say, but that I esteem and love you, and regret my being absent from you? I am more a stranger in this place than in Paris, and the manners are by no means so agreeable to me. There is a hardness in most characters, of which I now become more sensible than before. You have spoiled me for this country; and are obliged in conscience to be good to me when I shall return to you, which I hope will be soon. Remember me to Madame de Vierville<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> and Madame de Maury<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>, and to M. de Puiségur<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>, as well as to M. de Barbentane<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280307a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>. Embrace Madame de Boufflers in my name. I have only wrote to you and her since my arrival in London; which is a great crime I have been guilty of.</p><p>I have the honour to be with great sincerity</p><p class="signoff">Your most obedient humble servant, <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
