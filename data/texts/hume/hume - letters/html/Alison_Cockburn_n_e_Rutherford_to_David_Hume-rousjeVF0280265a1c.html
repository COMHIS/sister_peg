In every article I am him except peevishness which God willing, men oppressing, &amp; Time serving may bring about. A feeling heart is apt to Soar<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280265a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>. A Cool philosopher who has no guide but reason, no Aim but truth, no passions no follys but Love of fame, (a breath blown over his Tomb) Cannot possibly grow peevish. They only Live for their Sort of eternity, which we people of fancy, of warmth and imagination, we who believe in higher Scenes of existence, we Epicures who never will ceace from<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280265a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Ideas of enjoyment indulge in. We grow impatient, we do not meet with that perfection we are born wit[h] the Ideas of, &amp; we grow peevish for want of them. We forget we are in the nursery &amp; long for the dining room. This is my Rousseau's case &amp; will soon be mine. In the mean Time I am as jealous as <em>he</em> that any body should pay for my Bills.
