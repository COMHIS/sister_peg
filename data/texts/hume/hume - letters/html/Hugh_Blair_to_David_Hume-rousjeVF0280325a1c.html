	<div id="rousjeVF0280325a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p>I Received both your letters: and am exceedingly indebted to you for the many curious and entertaining Anecdotes you gave me Concerning Rousseau. They bestowed upon me Somewhat of the same Importance which you say your Connection with Rousseau himself bestowed upon you in Paris; by having so much information to give my friends, from You, concerning so extraordinary a personnage. Your Accounts pleased me the more that they coincided very much with the idea I have always formed of the man. Amiable, but Whimsical; Strong Sensibilities joined with an oddly arranged Understanding. He is a proof of what I always thought to be a possible mixture in human Nature, one being a Sceptic from the turn of their mind, &amp; yet an Enthusiast from the turn of their heart: for this I take to be his real character, a man floating betwixt doubts &amp; feelings, betwixt Scepticism &amp; Enthusiasm, leaning more to the latter than the former; his Understanding strangely tinctured by both. I do think his Heloise the most Eloquent book, ancient or modern that ever was written; There he was in his <em>fort</em>; Sentiment was predominant; and I never felt my Self, so impress'd<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280325a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> and affected by any thing I ever read, as by some parts of that Book. I Reverence Rousseau more for that than any other of his Productions. You would do me a very great favour if you would Enquire of him, or if you know already would inform me whether there be not foundation in his own History for <em>some</em> of the capital Scenes &amp; adventures of the Heloise. I have always had a Notion there was; I hardly believe it possible for any man to describe &amp; relate So ardently without some foundation in fact. It would be very obliging if you would remember this &amp; give me, if you can, some Satisfaction about this point, as I have been long curious to know it.
