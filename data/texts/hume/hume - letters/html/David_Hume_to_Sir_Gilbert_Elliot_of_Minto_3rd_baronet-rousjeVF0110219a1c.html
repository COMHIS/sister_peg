	<div id="rousjeVF0110219a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p>I received a letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0110219a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, a few days ago, from a lady in the Court of France, with whom I have been for some time in an epistolary correspondence, and who bears a very high character for knowledge and merit. She had wrote to me on the supposition I was still in London, because my last letter to her was dated from that place; and she recommends to me, in very earnest terms, the famous Rousseau, who is obliged to fly France, on account of some passages in a new <em>Treatise of Education</em> which he has published. You may believe, that it gave me great uneasiness, that I could not fulfil a duty, which would have been so agreeable to me, and which would have connected me with a man, whose character and talents I so much admire. I do not remember whether I have ever had a conversation with you on the writings of that author, and I know not whether you esteem them as much as I do: For my part, though I see some tincture of extravagance in all of them, I also think I see so much eloquence and force of imagination, such an energy of expression, and such a boldness of conception, as entitles him to a place among the first writers of the age. As to his personal character, I shall give it you in the words of my correspondent, after remarking that all the world speaks of him in the same style.<span href="/item/rousjeVF0110219a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> [.\ .\ .]</p><p>I own that I was extremely struck with the situation of so extraordinary a man; and having a great desire of being of some use to him, though absent, I have ventured to give you this trouble. Our present King and present Minister<span href="/item/rousjeVF0110219a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> are desirous of being thought encouragers of learning: Can they have a more proper opportunity of showing to the whole world that they are in earnest? Monsieur Rousseau is now thrown out of his ordinary course of livelihood; and though he rejects presents from private persons, he may not think himself degraded by a pension from a great monarch<span href="/item/rousjeVF0110219a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>: and it would be a singular victory over the French, worth a hundred of our Mindens<span href="/item/rousjeVF0110219a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, to protect and encourage a man of genius whom they had persecuted. I beseech you to advance this topic in places where your opinion may be able to produce the desired effect. It would be a favour to the ministers to suggest such an action to them. I fancy Rousseau's crime is only some sallies of Republicanism, and Protestantism, and satire against French manners: For I do not find that, in any of his writings, he has ever gone farther.</p><p>I have hitherto been a wanderer on the face of the earth, without any abiding city. But I have now at last purchased a house, which I am repairing; though I cannot say that I have yet fixed any property in the earth, but only in the air: For it is the third story of James's Court, and it cost me 500 pounds. It is somewhat dear, but I shall be exceedingly well lodged. On comparing my situation with poor Rousseau's, I cannot but reflect how much better booksellers we have in this country than they in France.</p><p>I am, Dear Sir,</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">Yours sincerely, David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">5 July 1762.</span></p></div>
