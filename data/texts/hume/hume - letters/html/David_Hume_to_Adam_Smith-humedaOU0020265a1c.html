I think that Bank more discredited by the last Step than by all their former Operations. They pretend to open at Air, in order to have a Pretence for striking off any farther Interest but as soon as great Sums are demanded, they pretend, that they are only to change small Notes for the Circulation of the Country; &amp; so refuse Payment: This is in effect shutting up again: They do not seem to have forseen, that it was the Interest of the two Banks here and of all the Bankers to make a Run upon them; for which they ought to have been prepar'd. As far as I can learn, the Duke of Queensberry<span href="/item/humedaOU0020265a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> alone signs the Bonds of Annuity in his own Name; but it is imagind that the Duke of Buccleugh, Mr Douglas<span href="/item/humedaOU0020265a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> &amp;c, have enterd into an Agreement to bear their Share: Otherwise it were Madness in him; &amp; indeed not very wise in him &amp; them in any case. I had last post a Letter from Andrew Stuart: I do not like the present Situation of that Supervisorship.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020265a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> Six to go from Europe, three to join them in the Indies: Corruption will get in among them; and probably Absurdity &amp; Folly. And at best nine Persons can never do any Business. He tells me, that Ferguson is sure of going out Secretary. I wish it may be so. It will be a great Vexation and Disappointment to him to return to his Office with which he was before somewhat disgusted.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D H</span></p></div>
