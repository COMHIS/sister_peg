	<div id="smitadOU0010186a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="date">1 Apr. 1776</span></p><p>Euge!<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> Belle! Dear Mr Smith: I am much pleas'd with your Performance, and the Perusal of it has taken me from a State of great Anxiety. It was a Work of so much Expectation, by yourself, by your Friends, and by the Public, that I trembled for its Appearance; but am now much relieved. Not but that the Reading of it necessarily requires so much Attention, and the Public is disposed to give so little, that I shall still doubt for some time of its being at first very popular:<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> But it has Depth and Solidity and Acuteness, and is so much illustrated by curious Facts, that it must at last take the public Attention. It is probably much improved by your last Abode in London. If you were here at my Fireside, I shoud dispute some of your Principles. I cannot think, that the Rent of Farms makes any part of the Price of the Produce, but that the Price is determined altogether by the Quantity and the Demand.<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> It appears to me impossible, that the King of France can take a Seigniorage of 8 per cent upon the Coinage. No body would bring Bullion to the mint:<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> It woud be all sent to Holland or England, where it might be coined and sent back to France for less than two per cent. Accordingly Neckre<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> says, that the French King takes only two per cent of Seigniorage. But these and a hundred other Points are fit only to be discussed in Conversation; which, till you tell me the contrary, I shall still flatter myself with soon. I hope it will be soon: For I am in a very bad State of Health and cannot afford a long Delay.</p><p>I fancy you are acquainted with Mr Gibbon: I like his Performance extremely and have ventured to tell him, that, had I not been personally acquainted with him, I shoud never have expected such an excellent Work from the Pen of an Englishman.<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> It is lamentable to consider how much that Nation has declined in Literature during our time. I hope he did not take amiss the national Reflection.</p><p>All your Friends here are in great Grief at present for the Death of Baron Mure,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> which is an irreparable Loss to our Society. He was among the oldest and best Friends I had in the World.</p><p>I wrote you about six Weeks ago,<span href="/item/smitadOU0010186a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> which I hope you received: You may certainly at present have the Subject of a Letter to me; and you have no longer any very pressing Occupation. But our Friendship does not depend on these Ceremonials.</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D H</span></p></div>
