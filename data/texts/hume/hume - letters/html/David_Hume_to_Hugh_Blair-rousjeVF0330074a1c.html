	<div id="rousjeVF0330074a1c"><p>[. . .] You may perhaps have heard, that Rousseau has elop'd from M<sup>r</sup> Davenport without giving any Warning; leaving all his Baggage except Md<sup>lle</sup>, about thirty pounds in Davenport's hands, and a Letter on the Table abusing him in the most violent Terms, insinuating that he was in a Conspiracy with me to ruin him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. He took the Road to London; but was missing for about a Fortnight: At last he emerges at<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Spalding in Lincolnshire<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>; whence he writes a Letter to the Chancellor<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, informing him that the bad Usage he had met with in England made it absolutely necessary for him to evacuate the Kingdom, and desiring his Lordship to send him a Guard to escort him in Safety to Dover; this being the last Act of Hospitality, he will desire of the Nation. He is plainly mad; tho I believe not more so, than he has been all his Life. The Pamphlet you mention<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> was wrote by one as mad as himself, and it was believd at first to be Tristram Shandy, but proves to be one Fuseli, an Engraver. He is a fanatical Admirer of Rousseau, but owns he was in the wrong to me. The Pamphlet I sent you was wrote by an English Clergyman whom I never saw<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330074a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>; a man of Character, and rising in the Church: For which Reason, it is more prudent in me to conceal his Name. When woud <em>you</em> have done so much for me?
