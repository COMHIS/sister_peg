	<div id="humedaOU0010183b1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">25<sup>th</sup> February, 1754.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have enclosed this letter under one to my friend Mr Blacklock, who has retired to Dumfries, and proposes to reside there for some time.</span> His character and situation are no doubt known to you, and challenge the greatest regard from every one who has either good taste or sentiments of humanity. He has printed a collection of poems, which his friends are endeavouring to turn to the best account for him. Had he published them in the common way, their merit would have recommended them sufficiently to common sale; but, in that case, the greatest part of the profit, it is well known, would have redounded to the booksellers. His friends, therefore, take copies from him, and distribute them among their acquaintances. The poems, if I have the smallest judgement, are, many of them, extremely beautiful, and all of them remarkable for correctness and propriety. Every man of taste, from the merit of the performance, would be inclined to purchase them: every benevolent man, from the situation of the author, would wish to encourage him; and, as for those who have neither taste nor benevolence, they should be forced, by importunity, to do good against their will. I must, therefore, recommend it to you to send for a cargo of these poems, which the author's great modesty will prevent him from offering to you, and to engage your acquaintance to purchase them. But, dear sir, I would fain go farther: I would fain presume upon our friendship, (which now begins to be ancient between us) and recommend to your civilities a man who does honour to his country by his talents, and disgraces it by the little encouragement he has hitherto met with. He is a man of very extensive knowledge and of singular good dispositions; and his poetical, though very much to be admired, is the least part of his merit. He is very well qualified to instruct youth, by his acquaintance both with the languages and sciences; and possesses so many arts of supplying the want of sight, that that imperfection would be no hindrance. Perhaps he may entertain some such project in Dumfries; and be assured you could not do your friends a more real service than by recommending them to him. Whatever scheme he may choose to embrace, I was desirous you should be prepossessed in his favour, and be willing to lend him your countenance and protection, which I am sensible would be of great advantage to him.</p><p>Since I saw you, I have not been idle. I have endeavoured to make some use of the library which was entrusted to me, and have employed myself in a composition of British History, beginning with the union of the two Crowns. I have finished the reigns of James and Charles, and will soon send them to the press. I have the impudence to pretend that I am of no party, and have no bias. Lord Elibank says, that I am a moderate Whig, and Mr Wallace<span href="/item/humedaOU0010183b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> that I am a candid Tory. I was extremely sorry that I could not recommend your friend to Director Hume,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010183b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> as Mr Cummin<span href="/item/humedaOU0010183b1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> desired me. <span class="linelast">I have never exchanged a word with that gentleman since I carried Jemmy Kirkpatrick<span href="/item/humedaOU0010183b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> to him; and our acquaintance has entirely dropt.</span></p></div>
