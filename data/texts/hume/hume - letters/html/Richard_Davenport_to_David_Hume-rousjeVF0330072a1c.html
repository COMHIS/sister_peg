	<div id="rousjeVF0330072a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>I can't help giving you the trouble of this — Last night I received a most melancholy letter from Poor Rousseau, dated Spalding in Lincolnshire<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330072a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, how or on what account he got to that place I cant for the life of me guess<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330072a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> but this I learn, that he is most excessively sick of his Situation &amp; is returning to Wootton as soon as I suppose he can well get there. He has been all the time at an Inn in that Town<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330072a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. Pray was the place you mentioned to me in that County any where near Spalding. I own to you I was quite moved to read his mournful Epistle. I am quite confirm'd in my Opinion of him — this last from him, is intirely different in Style from any I ever yet receiv'd — </p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>I have in my answer desired he would write to some friend of his in Town, to authorize him to receive his Majestys Bounty, as it becomes due. I have told him that his Agent must apply &amp; shew his letter to Mr. Lownds<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330072a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> of the treasury.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>Poor Rousseau writes of nothing but his misery, illness, afflictions, in a word of his being the most unfortunate man that ever existed. Good God most of these distresses are surely occasion'd by his own unhappy temper which I really believe is not in his power to alter, so let him be where he will, I fear he is certain to be uneasy.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>His passion for Botany has as I conjecture almost left him. If I'm right in my Guess, I have no sort of doubt, but he will again take to his pen as tis impossible for his imagination to remain idle.</p><p>I am Dear Sir</p><p class="signoff">Your Most Obedient <br />Humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">Rich. Davenport</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Davenport</span> Munday <span class="date">18. 1767.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>PS. I cant yet stir one yard from where I am without Assistance.</p></div></div>
