	<div id="humedaOU0010415a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">1 December, 1763</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Robertson,</p><p><span class="linefirst">Among other agreeable circumstances, which attend me at Paris, I must mention that of having a lady for a translator, a woman of merit, the widow of an advocate.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010415a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> She was before very poor, and known but to few; but this work has got her reputation, and procured her a pension from the Court, which sets her at her ease. She tells me, that she has got a habit of industry; and would continue, if I could point out to her any other English book she could undertake, without running the risk of being anticipated by any other translator. Your <em>History of Scotland</em> is translated, and is in the press; but I recommended to her your <em>History of Charles V</em>, and promised to write to you, in order to know when it would be printed, and to desire you to send over the sheets from London as they came from the press: I should put them into her hands, and she would by that means have the start of every other translator. My two volumes last published are at present in the press. She has a very easy natural style: sometimes she mistakes the sense;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010415a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> but I now correct her manuscript; and should be happy to render you the same service, if my leisure permit me, as I hope it will.</p><p>Do you ask me about my course of life? I can only say, that I eat nothing but ambrosia, drink nothing but nectar, breathe nothing but incense, and tread on nothing but flowers. Every man I meet, and still more every lady, would think they were wanting in the most indispensable duty, if they did not make me a long and elaborate harangue in my praise. What happened last week, when I had the honour of being presented to the Dauphin's children at Versailles, is one of the most curious scenes I have yet passed through. The Duc de B. the eldest, a boy of ten years old, stepped forth, and told me how many friends and admirers I had in this country, and that he reckoned himself in the number, from the pleasure he had received from the reading of many passages in my works. When he had finished, his brother, the Count de P., who is two years younger, began his discourse, and informed me, that I had been long and impatiently expected in France; and that he himself expected soon to have great satisfaction from the reading of my fine History. But what is more curious; when I was carried thence to the Count d'A., who is but four years of age, I heard him mumble something, which, tho he had forgot it in the way, I conjectured from some scattered words, to have been also a panegyric dictated to him. Nothing could more surprise my friends, the Parisian philosophers, than this incident . . . .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010415a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p>It is conjectured that this honour was paid me by express order from the Dauphin, who, indeed, is not on any occasion, sparing in my praise.</p><p>All this attention and panegyric was at first oppressive to me; but now it sits more easy. I have recovered, in some measure, the use of the language, and am falling into friendships, which are very agreeable; much more so than silly, distant admiration. They now begin to banter me, and tell droll stories of me, which they have either observed themselves, or have heard from others; so that you see I am beginning to be at home. It is probable, that this place will be long my home. I feel little inclination to the factious barbarians of London; and have ever desired to remain in the place where I am planted. How much more so, when it is the best place in the world! I could here live in great abundance on the half of my income; for there is no place where money is so little requisite to a man who is distinguished either by his birth or by personal qualities. I could run out, you see, in a panegyric on the people; but you would suspect, that this was a mutual convention between us. However, I cannot forbear observing, on what a different footing learning and the learned are here, from what they are among the factious barbarians above-mentioned.</p><p>I have here met with a prodigious historical curiosity, the Memoirs of King James II in fourteen volumes, all wrote with his own hand, and kept in the Scots College.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010415a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> I have looked into it, and have made great discoveries. It will be all communicated to me; and I have had an offer of access to the Secretary of State's office, if I want to know the despatches of any French minister that resided in London. But these matters are much out of my head. I beg of you to visit Lord Marischal, who will be pleased with your company. I have little paper remaining, and less time; and therefore conclude abruptly, by assuring you that I am,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Dear Doctor, Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
