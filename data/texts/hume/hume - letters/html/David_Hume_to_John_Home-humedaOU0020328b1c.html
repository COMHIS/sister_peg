They own a small Tumour in my Liver; but so small and trivial that it coud never do me any material Injury; and they say that I might have liv'd twenty Years with it, and never have felt any Inconvenience from it: Each of them has had Patients who have had Tumours in that part ten times larger without almost complaining for Years together. They have thoroughly perswaded me to be of their Opinion; and according to their united Sentiments, my Distemper is now a Hæmorrhage as before, which is an Illness, that I had as Lief dye of as any other. The First Part of the Text being now discuss'd, we proceed to the second viz the Cure, which I leave to another Opportunity. I send you enclosed a Letter, which my Nephew<span href="/item/humedaOU0020328b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> opend by Mistake, but finding, after he had read a few Lines, that it was not meant for him, he proceeded no farther.
