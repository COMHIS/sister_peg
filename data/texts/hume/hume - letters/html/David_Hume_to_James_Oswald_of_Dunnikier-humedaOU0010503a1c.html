	<div id="humedaOU0010503a1c"><p class="salutation">My dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">There is a gentleman here, an Abbé, and a man of letters, who is willing to enter into a commerce, or mutual exchange with me, on every point of political or commercial knowledge.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010503a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> He has a great deal of very exact information, with regard to everything that concerns these subjects; has great freedom of thought and speech, and has no connexions with any minister. As a sample, he has sent me the enclosed questions, which I could not exactly answer, and is willing to answer any of a like kind, which I could propose to him. I thought I could not do better than transmit them to you; and as I know you will also have questions to ask, I shall also transmit them to him, and you may depend on his answer as just and solid. I have left the margin large enough, to save you trouble. I know you are the most industrious and the most indolent man of my acquaintance; the former in business, the latter in ceremony. The present task I propose to you is of the former kind.</p><p>You will hear that Sir Charles Bunbury is appointed Secretary for Ireland.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010503a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Lord Hertford thinks it absolutely certain, that I am to succeed him; and I, too, think it very probable. My Lord throws up immediately, if this demand is not complied with; yet, notwithstanding these favourable circumstances, I shall not be wonderfully surprized in case of a disappointment. I know that I can depend on your good offices with Lord Halifax,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010503a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> and with every other person on whom you have influence. Lord Hertford writes this post to that noble lord. The present advantages I possess are so great, that it seems almost extravagant to doubt of success; and yet, in general, it appears to me almost incomprehensible how it should happen, that I, a philosopher, a man of letters, nowise a courtier, of the most independent spirit, who has given offence to every sect, and every party, that I, I say, such as I have described myself, should obtain an employment of dignity, and a thousand a year. This event is in general so strange, that I fancy, in the issue, it will not have place. <span class="linelast">I am, dear Sir, Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010503a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Paris</span></span> <span class="date">2<sup>d</sup> June, 1765.</span></p></div>
