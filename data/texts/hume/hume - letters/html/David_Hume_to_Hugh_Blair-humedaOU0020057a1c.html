I know you will pity me, when I tell you, that I am afraid I must publish this to the world in a Pamphlet, which must contain an account of the whole Transaction between us. My only Comfort is, that the Matter will be so clear as not to leave to any mortal the smallest possibility of Doubt: You know how dangerous any Controversy on a disputable Point woud be with a man of his Talents. I know not where the Miscreant will now retire to, in order [to] hide his Head from this Infamy.
