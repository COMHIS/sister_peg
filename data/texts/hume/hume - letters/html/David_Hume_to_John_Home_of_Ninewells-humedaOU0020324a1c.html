It seems Dr Gusthart, whom I consult here, had suspected from the first that all my Disorder proceeded from a Vice in my Liver; but not caring directly to oppose Sir John Pringle, he said nothing of the Matter, to me at least. But John Hunter, who marry'd our Cousin Roby Hume's Daughter,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020324a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> coming accidentally to Town, and expressing a very friendly Concern about me, Dr Gusthart proposed that I shoud be inspected by him: He felt very sensibly, as he said, a Tumor or Swelling in my Liver; and this Fact, not drawn by Reasoning, but obvious to the Senses, and perceived by the greatest Anatomist in Europe, must be admitted as unquestionable, and will alone account for my Situation. They kept, very foolishly, this Opinion of Mr Hunter's a secret from me till Yesterday; and now they pretend, that the Tumor, being small, may be discussed by Medicines and Regimen: A very silly Expectation, that an inveterate Disease of long Standing and in a vital Part, will yield to their feeble Remedies, in a man of my Years. To avoid however the Reproach of Obstinacy, I delayed my Journey, even though I feel myself declining every day, and am uncertain, whether at last I shall be able to make out the Journey. You made me promise, that I shoud write you sincerely the true State of my Health, than which really nothing can be worse. I hope however to set out in 8 or 10 days; and tis probable, that travelling, which seems not to disagree with me, may give me Force to reach my own Fireside, from which I shall never more depart, a safe Resolution, as it will require very short Perseverance to carry it into full Execution. I am Dear Brother</p><p> <span class="linelast">Very affectionately Yours</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
