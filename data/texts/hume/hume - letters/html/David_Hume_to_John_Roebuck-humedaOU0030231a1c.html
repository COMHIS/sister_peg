	<div id="humedaOU0030231a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">This Letter will be deliver'd to you by two Gentlemen, Friends &amp; Relations of Mine, Mr Hume,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030231a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> one of our principal Clerks of Session, &amp; Dr Hume,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030231a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> his Brother.</span> They are travelling thro' England, for Health, Amusement, &amp; Curiosity; and having told me, that they intended to pass by Birmingham, I resolv'd to use the Freedom of recommending them to your Acquaintance, and desiring you to show them what is curious in your industrious &amp; active Town. The Doctor in particular will chop Chymistry &amp; Physic &amp; natural Philosophy with you as long as you please; and both of them, you will find very well worth your Acquaintance.</p><p>You must also understand, that I am very well pleas'd with this Expedient, to send my Friends to you, in order to keep you in mind of me, till I shall be able to knock at your Gate myself, which I intend to do, whenever I pass to London; &amp; that I believe will be about this time twelvemonth.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030231a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p>I hope you do not persevere in your king-killing, antimonarchical Principles, which I never cou'd reclaim you from, when you was here. But I fancy, you thought I became a better Bairn towards the End of the Volume, of which you did me the Favor to peruse the Beginning.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030231a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Pray, how stand I in the opinion of your Club of Loyalists? I forget their Name: But I fancy, I am but little more in their good Graces than Yourself: They will probably think, that if you once depose a King, you may make a Fricassee of him afterwards.</p><p>I saw our Friend, Russel,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030231a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> two days ago: He is in very good Health. We frequently meet &amp; talk of you. My Friend, Dr Hume, is a great Chymist; so a Dash of Aquafortis in his Sauce will be very acceptable to him. But Mr Hume, his Brother, has but a weak Stomach; and a little plain beat Butter will be better for him.</p><p>My Compliments to Mrs Roebuck. I am Sir</p><p class="signoff">Your most obedient humble Servant <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">15th August 1757</span></p></div>
