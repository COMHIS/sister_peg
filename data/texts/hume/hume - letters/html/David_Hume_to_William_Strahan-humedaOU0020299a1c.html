	<div id="humedaOU0020299a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">26 of Octr 1775</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I have often regreted the Interruption of our Correspondence: But when you ceas'd to be a speculative Politician and became a practical one,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I coud no longer expect you woud be so communicative or impartial as formerly on that head; and my object with regard to Authorship, was, for a time, at an End.</span> The Reason of the present Trouble is of a different kind: Dr Trail,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the Professor of Divinity at Glasgow, is dead; and Dr Wight, the present Professor of Church History, is a Candidate for the Office: The place is filled by a Vote of the Professors: You are understood to have great influence with Wilson, the Professor of Astronomy: And I interest myself extremely in Dr Wight's success: These are my Reasons for writing to you. But I must also tell you my Reasons for interesting myself so much in Dr Wight's Behalf. He is a particular Friend of mine: He is very much connected with all mine and your particular Friends in the Church: He is a very gentleman-like agreeable Man: And above all, he is (without which I shoud not interest myself for him) a very sound and orthodox Divine. The case of Dr Trail, (his predecessor, as I hope) was somewhat particular with regard to Orthodoxy: He was very laudably a declar'd Enemy to all Heretics, Socinians, Arians, Anti-Trinitarians, Arminians, Erastians, Sabellians, Pelagians, Semipelagians: In short, of every Sect, whose name terminated in <em>ian</em>, except Presbyterian, to whom he had a declar'd and passionate Attachment. He said, that it signify'd nothing to pick out a little straggling Absurdity, here and there, from the System; while the whole immense Chaos, sufficient to over-whelm Heaven and Earth, still remain'd entire, and must still remain. But in Prosecution of these Views (which one cannot much blame) he mix'd a little of the Acrimony of his own Temper; and, perhaps undesignedly, sent away all the Students of Divinity very zealous Bigots, which had a very bad Effect on the Clergy of that Neighbourhood. Now, I shall answer for Dr Wight, that his Pupils shall have all the Orthodoxy, without the Bigotry, instill'd into them by his Predecessor. I believe Dr Robertson will write you on the same Subject; and I beg you woud not lose any time in applying to Mr Wilson, in case he shoud take any other Engagements, tho we do not yet hear of any other Candidate.</p><p>I must, before we part, have a little Stroke of Politics with you, notwithstanding my Resolution to the contrary. We hear that some of the Ministers have propos'd in Council, that both Fleet and Army be withdrawn from America, and these Colonists be left entirely to themselves. I wish I had been a Member of His Majesty's Cabinet Council, that I might have seconded this Opinion. I shoud have said, that this Measure only anticipates the necessary Course of Events a few Years; that a forced and every day more precarious Monopoly of about 6 or 700,000 Pounds a year of Manufactures, was not worth contending for; that we shoud preserve the greater part of this Trade even if the Ports of America were open to all Nations; that it was very likely, in our method of proceeding, that we shoud be disappointed in our Scheme of conquering the Colonies; and that we ought to think beforehand how we were to govern them, after they were conquer'd. Arbitrary Power can extend its oppressive Arm to the Antipodes; but a limited Government can never long be upheld at a distance, even where no Disgusts have interven'd: Much less, where such violent Animosities have taken place. We must, therefore, annul all the Charters; abolish every democratical Power in every Colony; repeal the Habeas Corpus Act with regard to them; invest every Governor with full discretionary or arbitrary Powers; confiscate the Estates of all the chief Planters; and hang three fourths of their Clergy. To execute such Acts of destructive Violence twenty thousand Men will not be sufficient; nor thirty thousand to maintain them, in so wide and disjointed a Territory. And who are to pay so great an Army? The Colonists cannot at any time, much less after reducing them to such a State of Desolation: We ought not, and indeed cannot, in the over-loaded or rather over-whelm'd and totally ruin'd State of our Finances. Let us, therefore, lay aside all Anger; shake hands, and part Friends. Or if we retain any anger, let it only be against ourselves for our past Folly; and against that wicked Madman, Pitt; who has reducd us to our present Condition. <em>Dixi</em>.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p>But we must not part, without my also saying something as an Author. I have not yet thrown up so much all Memory of that Character. There is a short Advertisement,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> which I wish I had prefix'd to the second Volume of the Essays and Treatises in the last Edition. I send you a Copy of it. Please to enquire at the Warehouse, if any considerable Number of that Edition remain on hands; and if there do, I beg the favour of you, that you woud throw off an equal Number of this Advertisement, and give out no more Copies without prefixing it to the second volume. It is a compleat Answer to Dr Reid<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> and to that bigotted silly Fellow, Beattie.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p><p>I believe that I have formerly mention'd to you, that no new Editions shoud be made of any of my Writings, without mentioning it to me; I shall still have some Corrections to make.</p><p>By Calculation, or rather Conjecture from former Sales, the last Edition of my History shoud be nearly sold off: Pray inform yourself whether it be not so: And how many remain on hand.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020299a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> <span class="linelast">I am with great Sincerity Dear Sir <br />Your affectionate humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
