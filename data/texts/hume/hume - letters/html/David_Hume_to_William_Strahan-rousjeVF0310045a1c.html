	<div id="rousjeVF0310045a1c"><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>My Friends at Paris have thought it absolutely necessary to publish an Account which I sent them, of my Transactions with Rousseau, together with the original Papers: The Affair had made a great Noise every where, and he had been such a Fool, as to write Defiances against me to all parts of Europe; so that the Justification of my Character they thought requir'd a Publication, which, however, is very much against my Will, coud it have been prevented. The whole will compose a pretty large Pamphlet, which, I fancy, the Curiosity of the Public will make tolerably saleable. I desire you to take upon you the printing and publishing of it; and if any Profit result from it to you, I shall be very happy; reserving the after property and Disposal of the Pamphlet to myself. You will take in what Bookseller you please; Becket<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> or Caddel<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> or any other: For Mr Millar<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> woud not think such a Trifle worthy of his Attention.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>I shall immediatly send you up a Copy of the original Manuscript, which is partly English, partly French; but more of the latter Language, which must be translated. I shall employ Mr Coutts's<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Cover. The Method the Translator must proceed is this: My Friends at Paris are to send me over in a Parcel ten Copies, which will be delivered to Miss Elliot<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>. I have desird her to send them to you; open the Parcel and take out one Copy for your own Use. Get a discreet and careful Translator<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>: Let him compare exactly the French Narration with my English: Where they agree, let him insert my English: Where they differ, let him follow the French and translate it: The Reason of this is, that I allowd my Friends at Paris to make what alterations they thought proper; and I am desirous of following exactly the Paris Edition. All my letters must be printed verbatim, conformable to the Manuscript I send you<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>My Parisian Friends are to add a Preface of their own composing, which must be translated: Add, by way of Nota bene, that the Original Letters will all be deposited in the Musæum. The Reason of this is, that Rousseau has been so audacious as to write, that I dare not publish his Letters without falsifying them.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>If you think, that a Republication of the French Edition will answer the Expence, I am also willing you should do it.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>Of the remaining nine Copies, send one to Lord Hertford<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>, lower Grosvenor Street, another to Mr Secretary Conway, another to Horace Walpole, Arlington Street, another to Lady Hervey<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310045a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>, St James Place. Send the remaining five to me by any private hand or by the Waggon. . . . .</p><p>I am Dear Sir Your most obedient Humble</p><p class="signoff">Servant <br /><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
