	<div id="humedaOU0010274a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">12<sup>th</sup> April, 1758</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I was told by Mrs Home, when she was in town, that you intended to make some researches into our family, in order to give them to Mr Douglas,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> who must insert them, or the substance of them, into his account of the Scottish nobility.</span> I think that your purpose is very laudable, and is very obliging to us all; and for this reason I shall inform you of what I know of the matter. These hints will at least serve to point out to you more authentic documents.</p><p>My brother has no very ancient charters: the oldest he has, are some charters of the lands of Horndean. There he is designated Home, or Hume, of Ninewells. The oldest charters of Ninewells are lost. It was always a tradition in our family, that we were descended from Lord Home,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> in this manner. Lord Home gave to his younger son<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> the lands to Tinningham, East Lothian. This gentleman proved a spendthrift and dissipated his estate, upon which Lord Home provided his grandchild, or nephew, in the lands of Ninewells as a patrimony. This, probably, is the reason why, in all the books of heraldry, we are styled to be cadets of Tinningham; and Tinningham was undoubtedly a cadet of Home. I was told by my grandaunt, Mrs Sinclair of Hermiston,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> that Charles Earl of Home<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> told her, that he had been looking over some old papers of the family, where the Lord Home designs Home of Ninewells either his grandson or nephew, I do not precisely remember which.</p><p>The late Sir James Home of Blackadder<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> showed me a paper, which he himself had copied a few days before from a gravestone in the churchyard of Hutton: the words were these — ‘Here lies John Home of Bell, son of John Home of Ninewells, son of John Home of Tinningham, son of John Lord Home, founder of Dunglas.’</p><p>I find that this Lord Home, founder of Dunglas, was the very person whom Godscroft<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> says went over to France with the Douglas, and was father to Tinningham: so thus the two stories tally exactly. He was killed either in the battle of Crevant or Verneuil, gained by the Duke of Bedford, the Regent, against the French. Douglas fell in the same battle. I think it was the battle of Verneuil. All the French and English histories, as well as the Scotch, contain this fact. This Lord Home was your ancestor, and ours, lived in the time of James the First and Second of Scotland, Henrys the Fifth and Sixth of England.</p><p>I have asked old Bell the descent of his family. He said he was really sprung from Ninewells, but that the lands fell to an heiress who married a brother of Polwarth's.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span></p><p>By Godscroft's account, Tinningham was the third son of Home in the same generation that Wedderburn was the second, so that the difference of antiquity is nothing, or very inconsiderable.</p><p>The readiest way of vouching these facts would be for you to take a jaunt to the churchyard of Hutton, and inquire for Bell's monument, and see whether the inscription be not obliterated; for it is above twenty-five years ago that I saw the paper in Sir James Home's hand, and he told us, at that time, that the inscription was somewhat difficult to be read. If it be still legible it would be very well done to take a copy of it in some authentic manner, and transmit it to Mr Douglas, to be inserted in his volume. If it be utterly effaced, the next, but most difficult task would be to search for the paper above-mentioned in the family of Home: it must be some time about the year 1440 or 1450. If both these means fail, we must rest upon the tradition.</p><p>I am not of the opinion of some, that these matters are altogether to be slighted. Though we should pretend to be wiser than our ancestors, yet it is arrogant to pretend that we are wiser than the other nations of Europe, who, all of them, except perhaps the English, make great account of their family descent. I doubt that our morals have not much improved since we began to think riches the sole thing worth regarding.</p><p>If I were in the country I should be glad to attend you to Hutton, in order to make the inquiry I propose. I doubt whether my brother will think of doing it: he has such an extreme aversion to everything that savours of vanity, that he would not willingly expose himself to censure; but this is a justice that one owes to their posterity, for we are not certain that these matters will be always so little regarded.</p><p>I shall farther observe to you, that the Lord Home, founder of Dunglas, married the heiress of that family, of the name of Pepdie, and from her we always bear the Pepingos in our arms.</p><p>I find in Hall's Chronicle<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> that the Earl of Surrey, in an inroad upon the Merse, made during the reign of Henry the Eighth, after the battle of Flodden, destroyed the castles of Hedderburn, West Nisgate, and Blackadder, and the towers of East Nisgate, and Winwalls. The names, you see, are somewhat disfigured; but I cannot doubt but he means Nisbet and Ninewells: the situation of the places leads us to that conjecture.</p><p>I have reason to believe, notwithstanding the fact, as Ninewells lay very near Berwick, our ancestors commonly paid contributions to the governor of that place, and abstained from hostilities and were prevented from ravages. There is, in Hayne's State Papers,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010274a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> a very particular account of the ravages committed by an inroad of the English, during the minority of Queen Mary. Not a village, scarce a single house in the Merse, but what is mentioned as burnt or overthrown, till you come to Whitwater. East of the river, there was not one destroyed. This reason will perhaps explain why, in none of the histories of that time, even the more particular, there is any mention made of our ancestors; while we meet with Wedderburn, Aiton, Manderston, Cowdenknows, Spott, and other cadets of Home.</p><p>I have learned from my mother, that my father, in a lawsuit with Hilton, claimed an old apprizing upon the lands of Hutton-Hall, upon which there had been no deed done for 140 years. Hilton thought that it must necessarily be expired; but my father was able to prove that, during that whole time there had not been forty years of majority in the family. He died soon after, and left my mother very young; so that there was near 160 years during which there was not forty years of majority. Now we are upon this subject, I shall just mention to you a trifle, with regard to the spelling of our name. The practice of spelling Hume is by far the most ancient and most general till about the Restoration, when it became common to spell Home contrary to the pronunciation. Our name is frequently mentioned in Rymer's Foedera, and always spelt Hume. I find a subscription of Lord Hume in the memoirs of the Sidney family, where it is spelt as I do at present. These are a few of the numberless authorities on this head.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I wish the materials I give you were more numerous and more satisfactory; but such as they are, I am glad to have communicated them to you.</span></p></div>
