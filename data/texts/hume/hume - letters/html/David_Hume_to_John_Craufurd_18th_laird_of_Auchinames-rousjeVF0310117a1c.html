	<div id="rousjeVF0310117a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Jack</p><p>[. . .] It happend as you foresaw; that I shoud at last, whether I wou'd or not, be oblig'd to give to the Public an Account of this ridiculous Affair between Rousseau and me. D'Alembert has made use of the discretionary Power I gave him, and has printed the Narrative you saw, with a Preface, giving an Account of the Necessity which he lay under to do so. The only thing, that displeases me is a Declaration annex'd<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, which is very disobliging to Horace Walpole: There is also a little Squib thrown at Mde. du Deffan<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> if I understand it right. Besides, some obliging things which I said, from my sincere Sentiments, of Mr. Walpole, are expung'd, which is a little unaccountable. Is it possible, that a Man of such Parts &amp; Virtues as Dalembert can bear an Ill will to Mr. Walpole merely because the latter has a Friendship for a Person whom the former hates? And does Philosophy serve us to so little purpose?<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Voltaire says you are a Philosopher: and all the world knows Rousseau to be one<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>: Voltaire himself is also one: I say nothing: but the Devil himself will not hinder me from thinking.</p><p>I have also wrote to Mr. Walpole about this Affair of Dalembert's Declaration<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span>; and as he makes Profession of being no Philosopher, I doubt not but I shall find him a reasonable Man. I only forgot to mention one thing to Mr Walpole, which I desire you to mention to him, when you see him. It is this: The Duke of Richmond may think it odd, that in a Letter of mine to Rousseau<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> I should have promis'd him the Duke's good Offices, tho' I had never spoke to his Grace on the Subject. But my Reason for trusting to the Duke was, that I knew his great Esteem for Rousseau, and Mr. Walpole besides, promised me, if it was necessary, his good Offices with the Duke, as he had already done with General Conway<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310117a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>. [. . .]</p><p>Yours sincerely</p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Edinburgh</span> <span class="date">5 of Novr 1766</span></p></div>
