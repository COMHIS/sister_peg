	<div id="humedaOU0030091a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Compiegne</span> <span class="date">12 of August 1765</span></p><p class="salutation">Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">I was honour'd with your Excellency's of the 5th of August on Thursday the 8th late in the Evening by Roworth the Messenger.</span> Next day, I desir'd an Audience of M. de Praslin, which was granted me on the subsequent day. M. de Guerchy<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> was in company with him. I touch'd successively on all the Points, recommended to me by your Excellency.</p><p>On the head of Dunkirk,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> M. de Praslin confirm'd to me, that the Agreement which M. de Guerchy had made with your Excellency shou'd be carry'd into Execution, viz, that the French shou'd instantly begin the Destruction of the Jettees erected in the Harbour of Dunkirk, that they shou'd proceed gradually in the Work, that they shou'd carefully observe the Effects of that Operation; and if the Result was to lessen the Depth of Channel, without preventing the Outlet of the Backwater; in that Case, the Object of both Courts was happily attain'd; the Harbour of Dunkirk wou'd be no longer formidable, and the Country behind wou'd still be preserv'd dry and healthy. But at the same time, he inculcated on me to remind your Excellency, that, if the Result shou'd prove otherwise; if, as was suspected, the filling up of the Channel prevented the Outlet of the Waters; in that Case, it was understood between the two Courts, not only that the French shou'd stop in the Destruction of the Jettees, but also that they might rebuild what they had destroy'd till some other Expedient cou'd be fallen on to drain the Country. I reply'd, that in such an Event the Expedient for that Purpose was obvious; it was the same which Lewis the 14th had put in Practice, and which had prov'd effectual during the Course of 40 Years, <em>viz</em>, the opening the Canal of Mardyke, and shutting the Sluice of Bergues. M. de Praslin answer'd, that this Expedient requir'd time to be carry'd into Execution; and it was not fitting, that, in the mean while a whole Province shou'd be utterly destroy'd. But he also beg'd of me not to imagine, that the Expedient I mention'd had ever in reality been effectual, or that the Country, during these forty Years, had ever been healthy. The Quarters of Dunkirk, he cou'd assure me, was then always avoided, as much as possible, by all the Officers, as destructive to their own Health and to that of the Soldiers; but at present Dunkirk was as healthy as Compiegne; and no Objections were ever made to the quartering there.</p><p>Our Conversation pass'd next to the Case of the Canada Bills;<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> where M. de Praslin acknowleg'd, that it was the Intention of his Court to pay the Cards and Billets d'Ordonnance in two or three Years: He cou'd not at present promise it ministerially nor precisely, till he had consulted with the Controler General: And in order to enable him to do so, he wish'd that we cou'd give him, as near as possible, the Amount of these Billets: For that a different Arrangement wou'd be requisite in proportion to the different Amount of the Demand. I told him, that, by the Accounts transmitted to me, he might safely take eleven Millions as being nearly the Amount of the Billets d'Ordonnance, and might make his Arrangement accordingly.</p><p>He also told me, that the Intention of his Court was to put the unregister'd Billets on the same footing with the register'd; but this Concession, he said, was loaded with a Condition, that the Proprietors shou'd declare their Acquiescence in the Liquidation of 25 per cent prompt Payment. As the Duke did not mention to me any Plan for their making this Declaration, it may probably be nothing but a general Menace thrown out, in order to intimidate them and make them more tractable.</p><p>I next open'd to him your Excellency's Demand of putting the Billets d'Ordonnance on the same Footing with the Bills drawn in 1759; a Proposal, I told him, which your Excellency was not authoriz'd by the Proprietors to make, but which you only hop'd they wou'd acquiesce in. He ask'd me, upon what Calculation or Principles of Reasoning you made that Demand. I us'd the Freedom to ask him in return, upon what Principle the Court of France had made the Reduction; if it was either on account of the Frauds committed by their own Officers, or on account of the low Price at which our Merchants had bought those Billets, I thought that nothing cou'd be more easy than to prove both of these Reasons to be insufficient. No! reply'd he, we insist on neither of these Topics: We alledge only the in-sufficient Value given for them by the first Proprietors, on account of the great Discredit into which they had fallen. Upon that Principle, answerd I, I think it easy to prove that the Demand of my Court is just and equitable. First a great Part of those Billets were issu'd preceding the Draught of Bills in 1759, and consequently are intitled to the same Liquidation as those Bills. Secondly Even in 1760 a great Part of them was issu'd in Payment of Corn and Cattle, which were tax'd at a low Value by the Governor and Intendant.</p><p>To prove the first Point, I told him, that it was impossible these Billets cou'd all of them have been converted into Bills of Exchange; because many of them were for very low Sums, such as 30 or 40 Sous; because, in so wide and wild a Country, it was not practicable for every Planter or Day-labourer to find means of sending his Billets to the Intendant's Office; because many of the Planters wou'd have no Use for Bills on Europe; and because the Intendant had shut up his Office and refus'd Bills to many, which had oblig'd the Proprietors of the Billets to depart to their several homes; and tho' afterwards the Cry of the Country had forc'd him again to open his Office, yet People at a Distance, either were unacquainted with this Change of Resolution or found it impracticable to return.</p><p>The Duke reply'd, that those small Sums I mention'd were Cards not Billets, and cou'd only amount to a mere Trifle; that as the Conversion of Billets into Bills on Europe was for many Years an annual and regular Operation, all the Planters had by Practice learn'd the Method of transmitting their Billets to the Intendant; that the Colony was always in general very much in Debt to the Mother Country, so that those who had no Demands of their own on Europe, easily found others who took their Bills from them on advantageous Terms; and that, tho' he acknowleg'd the Fact, of the Intendant's once shutting up his Office, yet he insisted, that, on opening of it again, most of the Planters found means to have their Billets presented, and to receive Bills in return.</p><p>However, added he, we do not absolutely assert, that there remain'd in the hands of the Canadians no Billets prior to the Draught in 1759. We believe there were some, but I am inform'd they are of small Amount. It is a particular Hardship and Injustice, which we ought to redress, and which we shall redress. M. de Fontanieu,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> who was at the head of the Commission for forming this Liquidation has assur'd me, that the Operation wou'd be as easy as it was equitable. I told him, added the Duke, that you propos'd to have a Conversation with him; he said that he desir'd nothing more; but he rather wish'd that it shou'd be at Paris than at Compiegne; in the former Place, he was in his Office, and cou'd produce to you authentic Documents of whatever he shou'd advance; he doubted not, but he cou'd prove to you or any reasonable Man, by the most irrefragable Arguments, that the Billets d'Ordonnance, had, in proportion to the State of the Case, been treated by our Arrets with even more Indulgence than the Bills of Exchange in 1759, with which you wou'd endeavour to put them on a Level.</p><p>I intend, on my return to Paris, which will be in a few days, to wait on M. de Fontanieu, and endeavour to draw from him some Lights on so intricate a Subject. I shall afterwards transmit to your Excellency the Result of our Conversation.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p><p>When I proceeded to the second Topic, viz, the low Taxation of Corn and Cattle in 1760, both the Duke of Praslin and M. de Guerchy absolutely deny'd that there ever had been any such Taxation.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> I ask'd the Duke, whether, in case he found upon Enquiry, that there had been such a Taxation (which there certainly was) whether I say, he wou'd engage also to remedy this particular Injustice. He said, that in a Case so much unknown to him, he was unwilling to take any Engagements: But be assur'd, said he, that we desire nothing but to do you Justice, and even to show you Favour. I am asham'd to say, that we here show you more favour than even to our own Subjects. We consent to grant prompt Payment to such Billets d'Ordonnance as are in the hands of the English; while we post-pone the Payment of the Billets, which are in the hands of the French. We make this Concession for the Sake of public Peace; and in order to establish a mutual Confidence between the Nations. We hope, that you will not be insensible of our fair Proceedings in this particular; and that we shall not meet with a double Difficulty, both of justifying ourselves to you and to our own People.</p><p>After this Conversation was over, without my being able to gain any thing upon him, because he always refer'd me to M. de Fontanieu, I next demanded, that Browne,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> the Innkeeper at Dunkirk, shou'd be restor'd to his Liberty and shou'd be allow'd to settle in Dunkirk. The first Demand he willingly comply'd with; but the second, notwithstanding the plain Sense of Treaties, I found in him no Disposition to agree to.</p><p>Having thus deliver'd to your Excellency an Account of my Conference with the Duke of Praslin and the Count de Guerchy, I proceed to such other Matters as His Majesty may desire to be acquainted with.</p><p>About two Months ago, Lord Hertford convey'd Intelligence to His Majesty, that a good Understanding was beginning between the Courts of Versailles and Berlin; at least, that the King of Prussia had made Advances towards renewing his Correspondence with France, and that this Court seemd very willingly to embrace the Overture. I can now inform your Excellency that the Negotiation is very far advanc'd; that there is a Correspondence of Letters already open'd between the two Courts; and that each will soon have a Minister resident with the other. It is not thought however that this Step will immediatly lead to any farther Consequences, except to preserve Decency between two such great Courts; nor do I find, that the Imperial Ambassadeur takes any Umbrage at it. The King of France has a personal and a strong Aversion to the King of Prussia; of which the latter is very sensible, as I have been inform'd by a Gentleman,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> who lives in great Familiarity with him. For he one day express'd to this Gentleman his Wonder whence that Antipathy cou'd arise; since he profess'd, that in all Transactions there had never any thing occurd which cou'd give the least personal Disgust to His most Christian Majesty.</p><p>The Clergy are at present assembled at Paris. As the Authority of the Crown is somewhat low in France, all public Bodies are apt to become troublesome; and for that Reason great Care was taken in the Election of Members to this Assembly. Yet, notwithstanding this Precaution, the Assembly, near three Weeks ago, voted unanimously an Address<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> to the King of a very extraordinary Nature. It consisted of seven Articles: They desir'd, that the Arret, which enjoin'd Silence with regard to the Bull unigenitus shou'd be recall'd; that the Reception of the Bull shou'd be declar'd an Article of Faith; that whoever refus'd to receive it shou'd not be admitted to the Sacraments, and every Confessor might demand of his Penitent whether he receivd it or rejected it; that a national Synod shou'd be assembled in order to examine the pastoral Letter of the Bishop of Aleth,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> who had justify'd the Expulsion of the Jesuites; that the Jesuites shou'd be re-establish'd as an Order, useful to the Church and to the State; that all civil Tribunals shou'd be strictly prohibited to intermeddle in eclesiastical Affairs; and that Permission shou'd be granted to examine the Origin and Extent of the Primacy of Lions.</p><p>This Address was presented to the King, who reply'd, that he woud deliberate upon it; but he desir'd that the Clergy, mean-while, shoud proceed to the finishing of such other Matters as were the Objects of their being assembled. Tho' the Matter had been conducted with great Secrecy, the Parliament of Paris had receivd Intelligence of it; and they met on Friday was Sennight, in order to deliberate about it. After some Debate, it was agreed to wait the Resolution of the King. This Affair, tho' it may not be attended with any immediate and violent Consequence, is regarded as a Transaction of great Importance. The Opposition, which before subsisted, is renderd still more violent between the Robe and the Church; and it will soon, in all Probability prove difficult for the Crown to preserve Tranquillity between them: The most judicious of the Clergy are uneasy at these violent Proceedings. I was the first that gave an Account of the Address to the Bishop of Senlis,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> a man of Sense and Knowlege; and he said to me, that the Matter was absolutely incredible, and that the whole must have been an Invention of the Enemies of the Clergy, in order [to] turn them into Ridicule. Mean-while, it is apparent from these and many other similar Events, that it is not likely France, were she disposd, will soon be in a Situation to disturb the Tranquillity of Europe.</p><p>The Dauphin<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span> has been ill and confind to his bed these three days; but I do not find, that any body esteems his Case dangerous.</p><p>I am assurd that this Court is determind soon to acknowlege the King of Poland.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030091a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span> I have the Honour to be, with great Regard</p><p> <span class="linelast">Sir <br />Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>Mr Secretary Conway</p></div></div>
