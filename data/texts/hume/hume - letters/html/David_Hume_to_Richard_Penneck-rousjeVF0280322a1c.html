Several (and I am of the Number) advise him to prefer your Neighbourhood in Surrey; and M<sup>r</sup> Stewart tells me, that you have been so good as to offer him your good Offices. He has also a Friend very near you, M<sup>r</sup> Malthus, who is desirous of doing him every kind of Service. Be so kind as to write to any Correspondent in that Country; and try whether you cou'd not find a Place, where he cou'd board at reasonable Rate, he and his Gouvernante: He wishes that the price cou'd be fixed for Bed, boarding, washing and firing; or for as many of these Circumstances as possible. As he is impatient to leave London, he wishes also to know whether there be not a tolerable Inn, in the Neighbourhood where he cou'd settle till he find a place to his Mind. It is probable you know M<sup>r</sup> Malthus's Direction. Be so good as to put it on the enclosed<span href="/item/rousjeVF0280322a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, and send it to the Post.
