	<div id="rousjeVF0340132a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Smith</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>I shall give you an Account of the late heteroclite Exploits of Rousseau, as far as I can recollect them: There is no Need of any Secrecy: They are most of them pretty public, and are well known to every body that had Curiosity to observe the Actions of that strange, undefineable Existence, whom one would be apt to imagine an<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> imaginary Being, tho' surely not an <em>Ens rationis</em>.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>I believe you know, that in Spring last, Rousseau<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> apply'd to General Conway to have his Pension. The General answerd to Mr<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> Davenport, who carry'd the Application, that I was expected to Town in a few days; and without my Consent and Approbation he would take no Steps in that Affair. You may believe I readily gave my Consent: I also sollicited the Affair thro' the Treasury; and the whole being finish'd, I wrote to Mr Davenport and desir'd him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> to inform his Guest that he needed<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> only<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/007" title="g [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_txt">g</span> appoint any Person to receive Payment<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>. Mr Davenport answered me that it was out of his Power to execute my Commission : For that his wild Philosopher, <span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> as he calld him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span>, had elop'd of<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/008" title="h [marked '8' in source]" class="notecall_txt">h</span> a sudden, leaving a great Part of his Baggage behind him, some Money in Davenports hands and a Letter<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> on the Table, as odd, he says, as the one he wrote to me<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>, and implying that Mr Davenport was engag'd with me in a treacherous Conspiracy against him. He was not heard of for a fortnight; till the Chancellor receiv'd a Letter from him, dated at Spalding in Lincolnshire<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span>, in which he said, that he had been seduc'd into this Country by a Promise of Hospitality, that he had met with the worst Usage, that he was in Danger of his Life from the Plots of his Enemies, and that he apply'd to the Chancellor, as the first civil Magistrate of the Kingdom, desiring him to appoint a Guard at his own (Rousseau's) Expence, who might safely conduct him<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> out of the Kingdom. The Chancellor made his Secretary reply<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/009" title="i [marked '9' in source]" class="notecall_txt">i</span> to him that he was mistaken in the Nature of the Country, for that the first Post-boy he coud apply to was as safe a Guide as the Chancellor coud appoint. At the very same time, that<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/010" title="j [marked '10' in source]" class="notecall_txt">j</span> Rousseau wrote this Letter to the Chancellor, he wrote to Davenport<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>, that he had elop'd from him, actuated by a very natural Desire, that of recovering his Liberty, but<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> finding he must still be in Captivity, he preferd that at Wootton: For his Captivity at Spalding was intolerable beyond all human Patience; and he was at present the most wretched being on the Face of the Globe: He wou'd therefore return to Wootton, if he were assur'd that Davenport wou'd receive<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/011" title="k [marked '11' in source]" class="notecall_txt">k</span> him. Here I must tell you, that the Parson of Spalding<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked 'f' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> was about two Months ago in London, and told Mr Fitzherbert<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked 'g' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span>, from whom I had it, that he had passd several Hours every day with Rousseau while he was in that Place; that he was chearful, good-humourd, easy, and enjoyed himself perfectly well, without the least Fear or Complaint of any kind. However, this may be, our Hero, without waiting for any Answer either from the Chancellor or Mr Davenport, decamps on a<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> sudden from Spalding, and takes the Road directly to Dover<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/012" title="l [marked '12' in source]" class="notecall_txt">l</span>; whence he writes a Letter to General Conway seven Pages long<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked 'h' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span>, and full of the wildest Extravagance in the World. He says, <span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/013" title="m [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_txt">m</span> that he has endur'd a Captivity in England which it was impossible any longer to submit to: It was strange, that the greatest in the Nation, and the whole Nation itself<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> shoud have been seduc'd by one private Man, to serve his Vengeance against another private Man : he found in every Face that he was here<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> the Object of general Derision and Aversion, and he<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> was therefore infinitely desirous to remove from this Country. He therefore begs the General to restore him to<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> his Liberty and allow him to leave England: He warns him of the Danger there may be of cutting his Throat in private, as he is unhappily a Man too well known, not to have Enquiries made after him, shoud he disappear of a Sudden: He promises, on Condition of his<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> being permitted to depart the Kingdom, to speak no ill of the King or Country or Ministers or even of M<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> Hume: As indeed, says he, I have perhaps no Reason; my Jealousy of him having probably arisen from my own suspicious Temper, sour'd by Misfortunes. He says, that he was<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/014" title="n [marked '14' in source]" class="notecall_txt">n</span> wrote a Volume of Memoirs, chiefly regarding<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/015" title="o [marked '15' in source]" class="notecall_txt">o</span> the Treatment he has met within England; he has left it in safe hands and will order it to be burnd, in case he be permitted to go beyond Seas, and nothing shall remain to the Dishonour of the King and his Ministers.<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/013" title="m [marked '13' in source]" class="notecall_txt">m</span> This Letter is very well wrote, so far as regards the Style and Composition; and the Author is so vain of it, that he has given about Copies as of a rare Production<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked 'i' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span>. It is indeed, as General Conway says, the Composition of a whimsical Man; not of a Madman. But what is more remarkable, the very same Post he wrote to Davenport<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked 'k' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span>, that having arrivd within Sight of the Sea, and finding he was really at Liberty to go or stay, as he pleas'd, he had intended voluntarily to return to him; but seeing in a News Paper an account of his Departure from Wootton, and concluding his Offenses were too great to be forgiven, he was resolvd to depart for France. Accordingly, without any farther Preparation and without waiting General Conway's Answer, he took his Passage <span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> in a Packet<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> Boat, and went off that very Evening. Thus you see, he is a Composition of Whim, Affectation, Wickedness, Vanity and Inquietude, with a very small, if any Ingredient of Madness. He is always complaining of his Health; yet I have scarce ever seen a more robust little Man of his Years: He was<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> tird in England, where he was neither persecuted nor caress'd and where, he was sensible, he had expos'd himself: He resolvd therefore to leave it; and having no Pretence, he is oblig'd to contrive all those Absurdities, which, he himself, extravagant as he is, gives no Credit to. At least, this is the only Key I can devise to his Character. The ruling Qualities above mentioned, together with Ingratitude, Ferocity, and Lying, I need not mention, Eloquence and Invention, form the whole of the Composition.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>When he arrivd at Paris, all my Friends, who were likewise all his, agreed totally to neglect him: The Public too disgusted with his multiplyd and indeed criminal Extravagancies, showd no manner of concern about him. Never was such a Fall<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/016" title="p [marked '16' in source]" class="notecall_txt">p</span> from the time I took him up, about a Year and a half before. I am told by DAlembert and Horace Walpole, that, sensible of this great Alteration, he endeavoured to regain his Credit by acknowledging to every body his Fault with regard to me: But all in vain. He has retird to a Village in the Mountains of Auvergne, as M. Durand<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/011" title="11 [marked 'l' in source]" class="notecall_nts">11</span> tells me; where no body enquires after him. He will probably endeavour to recover his Fame by new Publications; and I expect with some Curiosity the Reading of his Memoirs, which will <span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> I suppose<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> suffice to justify me in every body's Eyes, and in my own, for the Publication of his Letters and my Narrative of the Case. You will see by the Papers, that a new Letter of his to M. D, which I imagine to be Davenport<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/012" title="12 [marked 'm' in source]" class="notecall_nts">12</span>, is publishd. This Letter was probably wrote immediately on his Arrival at Paris; or perhaps is an Effect of his usual Inconsistance: I do not much concern myself which: Thus he has had the Satisfaction, during a time, of being much talkd of, for his late Transactions; the thing in the World he most desires: But it has been at the Expence of being<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/txt/017" title="q [marked '17' in source]" class="notecall_txt">q</span> consign'd to perpetual Neglect and Oblivion. My Compliments to Mr Oswald<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/013" title="13 [marked 'n' in source]" class="notecall_nts">13</span>; and also to Mrs Smith<span href="/item/rousjeVF0340132a1c/nts/014" title="14 [marked 'o' in source]" class="notecall_nts">14</span>.
