	<div id="humedaOU0010148a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Ninewells, near Berwick</span> <span class="date">18<sup>th</sup> February, 1751</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I will not pay you so bad a compliment as to say I was not angry with you for neglecting me so long; that would be to suppose I was indifferent whether I had any share in your memory or friendship.</span> However, since there is nothing in it but the old vice of indolence,</p><p>Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></p><p>Ed io anche sono Pittore, as Corregio said; I am therefore resolved to forgive you, and to keep myself in a proper disposition for saying the Lord's Prayer, whenever I shall find space enough for it.</p><p>I must own I could not but think you excusable, even before you disarmed me by your submission and penitence; 'tis so common an artifice for provincials to hook on a correspondence with a Londoner, under pretext of friendship and regard, that a jealousy on that head is very pardonable in the latter. But I ought not to lie under that general suspicion; for the fashionable songs I cannot sing; the present or the expectant ministers I have no interest in; the old good books I have not yet all read or pondered sufficiently; and the current stories and <em>bon mots</em>, I would not repeat if I knew them. You see, therefore, that if I were not concerned about Dr Clephane, I never should desire to hear from him, and consequently that a line of his would be equally acceptable whether it comes from London or Crookhaven.</p><p>I have executed your desire and the Colonel's as well as I could, but have not, I believe, succeeded so well as last year:<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the subject, indeed, was exhausted, and the patient may justly, I fear, be esteemed incurable. I leave you to manage the matter as you best can: but I beg of you to conduct it, so as not to make a quarrel betwixt Fraser and me; he is an honest, good-humoured, friendly, pleasant fellow (though, it must be confessed, a little turbulent and impetuous), and I should be sorry to disoblige him. The Colonel would be heartily bit, if by this or any other means Fraser could be cured of his politics and patriotism; and all his friends would lose a great deal of diversion, and certainly would not like him near so well, if he were more cool and reasonable, and moderate, and prudent. But these are vices he is in no manner of danger of. Is it likely that reason will prevail against nature, habit, company, education, and prejudice? I leave you to judge.</p><p>But since I am in the humour of displaying my wit, I must tell you that lately, at an idle hour, I wrote a sheet called the Bellman's Petition:<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> wherein (if I be not partial, which I certainly am) there was some good pleasantry and satire. The printers in Edinburgh refused to print it, (a good sign, you'll say, of <em>my</em> prudence and discretion). Mr Mure, the member, has a copy of it; ask it of him if you meet with him, or bid the Colonel, who sees him every day at the House, ask it, and if you like it read it to the General, and then return it. I will not boast, for I have no manner of vanity; but when I think of the present dulness of London, I cannot forbear exclaiming</p><p>Rome n'est pas dans Rome, <br />C'est par tout où je suis.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> <br />A namesake of mine<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> has wrote a tragedy,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> which he expects to come on this winter. I have not seen it, but some people commend it much. 'Tis very likely to meet with success, and not to deserve it, for the author tells me, he is a great admirer of Shakespere, and never read Racine.</p><p>When I take a second perusal of your letter, I find you resemble the Papists, who deal much in penitence, but neglect extremely <em>les bonnes œuvres</em>. I asked you a question with regard to the plans of ancient buildings in Dr Mead's collection.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> Pray, are they authentic enough to be cited in a discourse of erudition and reasoning? have they never been published in any collection? and what are the proper terms in which I ought to cite them? I know you are a great proficient in the <em>virtu</em>, and consequently can resolve my doubts. This word I suppose you pretend to speak with an <em>e</em>, which I own is an improvement: but admitting your orthography, you must naturally have a desire of doing a good-natured action, and instructing the ignorant.</p><p>It appears to me that apothecaries bear the same relation to physicians, that priests do to philosophers; the ignorance of the former makes them positive, and dogmatical, and assuming, and enterprising, and pretending, and consequently much more taking with the people. Follow my example — let us not trouble ourselves about the matter; let the one stuff the beasts' guts with antimony, and the other their heads with divinity, what is that to us? according to the Greek proverb, they are no more, but as <span lang="grc">ἐς τὴν ἀμίδα ἐνουροῦντες</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010148a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span></p><p>You may tell me, indeed, that I mistake the matter quite; that it is not your kindness for the people, which makes you concerned, but something else. In short, that if self-interest were not in the case, they might take clysters, and physic, and ipecacuanha, till they were tired of them. Now, dear Doctor, this mercenary way of thinking I never could have suspected you of, and am heartily ashamed to find you of such a temper.</p><p> <span class="linelast">If you answer this any time within the twelve months 'tis sufficient, and I promise not to answer you next at less than six months' interval; and so, as the Germans say, je me recomante a fos ponnes craces.</span></p></div>
