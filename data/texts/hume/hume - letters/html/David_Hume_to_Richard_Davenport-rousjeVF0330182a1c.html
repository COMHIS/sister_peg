	<div id="rousjeVF0330182a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear S<sup>ir</sup></p><p><span class="parano">[para. 1]</span></p><p>You seem'd desirous of knowing what may have become of your old Guest, the wild Philosopher: I <span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> heard by<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> a Letter yesterday from Paris<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, that he had appeard at Meudon, in the neighbourhood of that City, and had there<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> shown himself in a pretty public manner: My Friend adds, that, from the late Transactions, all the World looks on him as absolutely mad; yet it was to be fêar'd, if he continu'd to appear publickly, he wou'd either be put in arrest, or banish'd the Kingdom. However, if you have any thing to write to him, I believe I cou'd find the means of conveying it; and you will therefore be so good as to send it to me. He is much to be pity'd, particularly from the strange unhappy Turn<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> that his Madness has taken: And I doubt he may remain long in<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> his present melancholy<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Situation, too wise to be confin'd, too mad to govern himself. Some People will even<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> question, whether he ever was otherwise, notwithstanding the great Genius and Talents, that appear in his writings.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 2]</span></p><p>I know not, what can be done with regard to his Pension: It has pass'd all the Forms in the Treasury; but unless he appoint some Person to receive it, it never can be pay'd. Be so good as to mention that Matter to him, and desire him to write a Letter to Charles Lowndes Esq<sup>r</sup> <span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, Secretary to the Treasury, appointing him to pay the Money to some<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span> Person, whom he<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>, Rousseau, shall choose.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 3]</span></p><p>I shall be glad to have a Copy of his Letter to you on leaving you<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. I do not know, if you heard, that he said to a<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Gentleman in Lincolnshire that your Housekeeper had quarreld with his Gouvernante, and that the former threw cinders and Ashes into his Pot, which was the Reason of his leaving you. By all Accounts, this<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/txt/006" title="f [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_txt">f</span> same Demoiselle is a very mischievous Creature: I have been assur'd, that she was the Cause of all the Fray between him and me.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 4]</span></p><p>We shall, no doubt, have his Memoirs soon publish'd, which will be a curious Performance. But you think his chief Occupation while at Wootton was of a different Nature. Have you any Notion what it was?</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 5]</span></p><p>Lord Holderness has thank'd me much for your Civility to his Steward, who is much satisfy'd with your Machine. Yesterday, I was giving to Charles Turner of Yorkshire<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked 'd' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> an Account of its Operation: He stands much in need of such a Machine in his part of the World; and I may perhaps have occasion to give you the same Trouble with regard to him. But I know that you do not regard the Propagation of Improvements in Husbandry as a Trouble.</p><p><span class="parano">[para. 6]</span></p><p>You will probably see in a few Posts an Account of General Conway's Resignation<span href="/item/rousjeVF0330182a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked 'e' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span>: However, I shall not immediately leave London, and shall be glad to hear from you.
