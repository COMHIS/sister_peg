	<div id="humedaOU0020171a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">London</span></span> <span class="date">27 of November, 1767.</span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I was always sensible, dear Madam, that there were several inconveniences attending one's settlement in a foreign country: but I was never much alarmed with any of them, except that of wars breaking out between France and England; an event which, from the opposite interests, and still more the contrary humours of the two nations, is always to be dreaded.</span> In this respect, it must be owned, that France has not usually adopted such a liberal practice as that of England. No Frenchman is ever expelled this country even when the sovereigns are at war; but this is almost always the case in France; and on the commencement of the last hostilities, some Englishmen, who had great protection, and who earnestly desired to remain, were yet obliged to leave the country. I suppose the reason of this difference in conduct proceeds from the difference in our governments: for as we cannot pretend to secrecy, we care not who is acquainted with our measures; which is not precisely the case with you. This prospect, I own, always gave me uneasiness. A man, in the decline of life, to be expelled a country, which he had chosen for the place of his residence, and where he had formed a number of agreeable connexions, must suffer a violent shock; especially, if he is to return to company less suited to him, and who are perhaps disgusted with the preference given to foreigners. But I was willing to shut my eyes to this inconvenience, which was distant, and depended on accident: I could more easily bear this prospect, than the immediate and final separation from friends whom I loved; and I shall not name to you the person who had the chief hand in my taking this determination. But here, another office has been conferred upon me, which, though I did not desire it, I could not avoid; and if I should return to settle in France, after being twice employed by the English ministry in places of trust and confidence, could I hope that, in case of a war, I should be allowed to remain unmolested; when, even considered in the light of a man of letters, I could scarcely flatter myself with enjoying that privilege? Add to this that, when I shall get rid of this office (which I hope will be soon) I am almost universally exhorted to continue my History; and all imaginable assistance has been promised me. The King himself has been pleased to order that all the records and public offices shall be open to me, and has even sent for some papers from Hanover, which he thought would be useful. You see then, my dear friend, what reason I have to remain in suspense: for even though a permission should be granted me to remain at Paris, in case of a rupture, the most unexceptionable conduct could not free me from suspicion; and I must tremble at every mark of jealousy or ill-will from every clerk in office. However, I cannot yet renounce the idea, which was long so agreeable to me, of ending my days in a society which I love, and which I found peculiarly fitted to my humour and disposition. I can only delay the taking any determination till the event shall require it of me.</p><p>I saw here with Lord Holdernesse, an architect recommended to him by you and the Prince of Conti: you may believe, that these names were not indifferent to me. I immediately gave him a letter to my friend, Mr Adam, a man of genius, and allowed to be the best architect in this country, or perhaps in Europe. He delivered the letter; but some affairs called him suddenly from this country; so that Adam had not an opportunity to be so serviceable to him as he intended.</p><p>Horace Walpole told me he was so happy as to see you several times at Paris. I was much pleased with the account he gave me of your state of health and spirits and way of life. I hope he was not deceived. Next to this I should be happy to hear good accounts, or rather the continuance of good accounts, of the Count de Boufflers:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020171a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I foresee that the satisfaction of your future life is likely to depend much on his conduct.</p><p>There is an affair broke out, which makes a great noise, between Lady Bolingbroke<span href="/item/humedaOU0020171a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> and your friend Beauclerc.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020171a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> This lady was separated from her husband some time ago; but ‘tis pretended, bore a child lately to Mr Beauclerc; and it is certain her husband has begun a process for a divorce, in which nobody doubts of his success. It is a great pity: she is handsome, and agreeable, and ingenious, far beyond the ordinary rate. I know not whether she was of your acquaintance.</p><p>Pray remember me in the kindest and most respectful manner to Madame de Barbantane: let her know that I answered her letter long ago. This I mention, not that I looked for any answer from her; for mine required no answer. But I am really afraid that my letter might have miscarried; because I put, somewhat imprudently, an article of news in it,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020171a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> which might have been the cause of its being intercepted; in which case, she would naturally be inclined to blame my negligence.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I hope you remember, that the new year is approaching; and that you think of your promise at that time.</span></p></div>
