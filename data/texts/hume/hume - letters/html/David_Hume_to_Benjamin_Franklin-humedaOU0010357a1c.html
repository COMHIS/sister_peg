Mr Russell's remarks, besides the just praises of your invention, contained only two proposals for improving it. One was, that in houses, where the rain water is carried off the roof by a lead pipe, this metallic body might be employed as a conductor to the electric fire, and save the expense of a new apparatus. Another was, that the wire might be carried down to the foundations of the house, and be thence conveyed below ground to the requisite distance, which would better secure it against accidents. I thought it proper to convey to you these two ideas of so ingenious a man, that you might adopt them, if they appear to you well founded.</p><p>I am very sorry, that you intend soon to leave our hemisphere. America has sent us many good things, gold, silver, sugar, tobacco, indigo, etc.; but you are the first philosopher, and indeed the first great man of letters, for whom we are beholden to her. It is our own fault, that we have not kept him; whence it appears, that we do not agree with Solomon, that wisdom is above gold; for we take care never to send back an ounce of the latter, which we once lay our fingers upon.</p><p>I saw yesterday our friend Sir Alexander Dick,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010357a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> who desired me to present his compliments to you. We are all very unwilling to think of your settling in America, and that there is some chance for our never seeing you again; but no one regrets it more than does,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Dear Sir, Your most affectionate humble Servant,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010357a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p></div>
