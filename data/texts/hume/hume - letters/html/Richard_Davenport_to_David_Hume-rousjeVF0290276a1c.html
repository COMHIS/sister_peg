	<div id="rousjeVF0290276a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p>I have been constantly at this place ever since I did my self the pleasure of writing my last letter to you<span href="/item/rousjeVF0290276a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span>, in which I said I should leave [for]<span href="/item/rousjeVF0290276a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> Wootton in three or four days. The rains have continued from that time to this, which have kept me every day at home. Mr Rousseau is at Wootton &amp; I purpose going over to see him as soon as the weather settles. What you observe of him is certainly very true, his refusal amaz'd me, but I hope the letter you have now sent<span href="/item/rousjeVF0290276a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> will have the Effect, your goodness, &amp; care for his interest desires it should have, his heart is good, &amp; tender, but his sensibility too exquisite. As he never spoke to me upon the Subject of the Pension, I cant imagine what his thoughts are, but If I may venture to Guess, it seems as if he thought it not right, after having refus'd it from one King, to accept it from another. He is I am Sure busy in writing, &amp; it should be some large affair, by the quantity of Paper he bought<span href="/item/rousjeVF0290276a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'c' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span>. His health is but precarious &amp; the frequent returns of his disorder, must make his temper sometimes uneven.</p><p>You must not forget your promise of letting me have the honor of your Company as you pass this way. The Effects of my plough are visible with a witness, that Land done with it a year &amp; half ago, is six times as good as it was before that operation.</p><p>I shall long to hear Mr R. has changd his mind<span href="/item/rousjeVF0290276a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span>, perhaps when I see him he'll tell me, for in most things he's quite communicative.</p><p>I am Dear Sir</p><p class="signoff">Your most Obliged &amp; Obedient <br />Hble Ser<sup>t</sup> <br /><span class="sig">Rich<sup>d</sup> Davenport</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Davenport</span> <br /> <span class="date">June 23<sup>d</sup> <em>1766</em>.</span></p></div>
