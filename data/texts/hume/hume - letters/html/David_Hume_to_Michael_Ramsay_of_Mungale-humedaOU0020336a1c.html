Perhaps you was afraid, that you would have no Conveniency in this little House, or that you would disturb us. For my Share, the State of my Health is such, &amp; Indolence makes such Progress o'er me for want of being resisted, that wtout the least Scruple, I shall give you my room, &amp; be contented to share one with John. This I can assure you, will be no manner of Loss to me, &amp; I hope it will make you as easy as you cou'd wish. At Lawers I can never conceive, you can live to your Satisfaction, or according to the Projects you have form'd. I wish however you had informd me of your Designs and the State of your Health. For my Share I have so little confortable in these respects to tell you, that I believe it will be no Pleasure to you to hear it. But I hope you are in a contrary Case.
