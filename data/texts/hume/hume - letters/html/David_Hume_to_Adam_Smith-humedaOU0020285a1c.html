The Settlement to be made on Ferguson is a very narrow Compensation for his Class, if he must lose it: He wishes to keep it, and to serve by a Deputy in his Absence. But besides that this Scheme will appear invidious and is really scarce admissible, those in the Town Council, who aim at filling the Vacancy with a Friend, will strenuously object to it; and he himself cannot think of one who will make a proper Substitute.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020285a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I fancy, that the chief Difficulty wou'd be remov'd, if you cou'd offer to supply his Class, either as his Substitute or his Successor, with a Purpose of resigning upon his return. This notion is entirely my own, and shall never be known to Ferguson, if it appear to you improper. I shall only say, that he deserves this friendly Treatment, by his friendly Conduct, of a similar kind, towards poor Russel's<span href="/item/humedaOU0020285a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Family.</p><p>Pray, what strange Accounts are these we hear of Franklyn's Conduct?<span href="/item/humedaOU0020285a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I am very slow in believing that he has been guilty in the extreme Degree that is pretended; tho' I always knew him to be a very factious man, and Faction, next to Fanaticism, is, of all passions, the most destructive of Morality. How is it suppos'd, he got Possession of these Letters? I hear that Wedderburn's Treatment of him before the Council, was most cruel, without being in the least blameable. <span class="linelast">What a Pity!</span></p></div>
