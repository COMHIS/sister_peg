	<div id="humedaOU0010335a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">[November or December, 1760]</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">You gave me a sensible Satisfaction by writing to me; and tho I am a little lazy myself in writing (I mean, Letters: For as to other kinds of writing, your Press can witness for me, that I am not Iazy) there is nothing gives me greater Pleasure than hearing from my Friends, among whom I shall be always fond of ranking Mr Strahan.</span> You have probably heard from Mr Millar, that I am wholly engrossd in finishing my History; and have been so above a twelvemonth. If I keep my Health, which is very good and equal to any Fatigue, I shall be able to visit you in eight or nine Months; and then you may expect to have a very troublesome Dun upon you, in making Demands of a regular Visit of your Devil; and I shall be able to cure you of some Indolence, which as our friend opposite Catherine Street in the Strand<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> complains to me, is growing upon you. If this Indolence comes from Riches,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I hope also to cure it another way, by gaining your Money at Whist; tho' really the Person abovementiond is a Proof that Indolence is no immediate or necessary Effect of Riches: So that I fancy it is born with you; and that there is no hopes of curing you. However, it will give me some Satisfaction to come to you in case of any Negligence, and first scold you and then gain your Money, in order to punish you.</p><p>I am sorry, both on your Account and Mr Rose's,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> for whom I have a great Regard, that it shoud be absolutely impossible for me, till my present Undertaking is finishd, to have any hand in what he proposes to me.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> If I had leizure, I shoud certainly comply with his Request: He only disobliges me in mentioning any other Acknowlegment, than his being sensible of my Inclination to oblige him.</p><p>Is this new Reign to be the Augustan Age?<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> or have the Parsons got entire Possession of the young Prince? I hear that they brag much of their Acquisition; but he seems by his Speech to be a great Admirer of his Cousin of Prussia,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> who surely is no Favourer or Favourite of theirs. I wonder how Kings dare be so free: They ought to leave that to their Betters;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010335a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> to Men who have no Dependance on the Mob, or the Leaders of the Mob. As to poor Kings they are obligd sometimes to retract and to deny their Writings.</p><p>I was glad to observe what our King says, that Faction is at an End and Party Distinctions abolish'd. You may infer from this, that I think I have kept clear of Party in my History; that I think I have been much injurd when any thing of that Nature has been imputed to me, and that I now hope the public Ear will be more open to Truth: But it will be a long time first; and I despair of ever seeing it.</p><p>I beg my Compliments to Mrs Strahan, and all your Family, and am Dear Sir with great Sincerity,</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
