	<div id="humedaOU0020193b1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="date">[Nov. or Dec. 1768]<span href="/item/humedaOU0020193b1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span></p><p><span class="linefirst">I got yesterday from Strahan about thirty sheets of your History, to be sent over to Suard,<span href="/item/humedaOU0020193b1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> and last night and this morning have run them over with great avidity.</span> I could not deny myself the satisfaction (which I hope also will not displease you) of expressing presently my extreme approbation of them. To say only they are very well written, is by far too faint an expression, and much inferior to the sentiments I feel; they are composed with nobleness, with dignity, with elegance, and with judgment, to which there are few equals. They even excel, and, I think, in a sensible degree, your <em>History of Scotland</em>. I propose to myself great pleasure in being the only man in England, during some months, who will be in a situation of doing you justice, after which you may certainly expect that my voice will be drowned in that of the public.</p><p>You know that you and I have always been on the footing of finding in each other's productions <em>something to blame and something to commend</em>; and, therefore, you may perhaps expect also some seasoning of the former kind; but really neither my leisure nor inclination allowed me to make such remarks, and I sincerely believe you have afforded me very small materials for them. However, such particulars as occur to my memory I shall mention. <em>Maltreat</em> is a Scotticism which occurs once. What the devil had you to do with that old-fashioned dangling word <em>wherewith</em>? I should as soon take back <em>whereupon, whereunto</em>, and <em>wherewithal</em>. I think the only tolerable decent gentleman of the family is <em>wherein</em>, and I should not choose to be often seen in his company. But I know your affection for <em>wherewith</em> proceeds from your partiality to Dean Swift, whom I can often laugh with, whose style I can even approve, but surely can never admire. It has no harmony, no eloquence, no ornament, and not much correctness, whatever the English may imagine. Were not their literature still in a somewhat barbarous state, that author's place would not be so high among their classics. But what a fancy is this you have taken of saying always <em>an hand, an heart, an head</em>? Have you <em>an ear</em>? Do you not know that this <em>n</em> is added before vowels to prevent the cacophony, and ought never to take place before <em>h</em> when that letter is sounded? It is never pronounced in these words, why should it be wrote? Thus, I should say, <em>a history</em>, and <em>an historian</em>; and so would you too, if you had any sense. But you tell me that Swift does otherwise. To be sure, there is no reply to that; and we must swallow your <em>hath</em> too upon the same authority. I will see you d — d sooner. — But I will endeavour to keep my temper.</p><p>I do not like this sentence in page 149. 'This step was taken in consequence of the Treaty Wolsey had concluded with the Emperor at Brussels, and which had hitherto been kept secret.' Si sic omnia dixisses, I should never have been plagued with hearing your praises so often sounded, and that fools preferred your style to mine. Certainly it had been better to have said, 'which Wolsey &amp;c'. That relative ought very seldom to be omitted, and is here particularly requisite to preserve a symmetry between the two members of the sentence. You omit the relative too often, which is a colloquial barbarism, as Mr Johnson calls it.</p><p>Your periods are sometimes, tho not often, too long. <span class="linelast">Suard will be embarassed with them, as the modish French style runs into the other extreme . . . .</span></p></div>
