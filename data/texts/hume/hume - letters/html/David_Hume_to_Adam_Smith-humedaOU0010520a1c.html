I decline all farther Engagements. Lord Hertford wrote me, that the Office of Usher to the House of Commons in Ireland commonly yielded 900 during a Session: He coud get one to serve for 300 and destind the rest for me, if I pleas'd: But I have refusd this Emolument, because I woud not run into the Ways of the World and catch at Profit from all hands. I am sure you approve of my Philosophy.</p><p>As a new Vexation to temper my good Fortune, I am much in Perplexity about fixing the Place of my future Abode for Life. Paris is the most agreeable Town in Europe, and suits me best; but it is a foreign Country. London is the Capital of my own Country; but it never pleasd me much. Letters are there held in no honour: Scotsmen are hated: Superstition and Ignorance gain Ground daily. Edinburgh has many Objections &amp; many Allurements. My present Mind, this Forenoon the fifth of September, is to return to France. I am much pressd here to accept of Offers, which woud contribute to my agreeable Living, but might encroach on my Independance, by making me enter into Engagements with Princes &amp; great Lords &amp; Ladies. Pray give me your Judgement.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010520a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span></p><p>I regreat much I shall not see you. I have been looking for you every day these three Months. Your Satisfaction in your Pupil gives me equal Satisfaction.</p><p>You must direct to me under the Title of <em>Chargé des Affaires d'Angleterre a la Cour de France</em>, without anything farther.</p><p>I cannot by the Post enter into a Detail of our late strange Revolutions: But it is suspected, that the Accession of Mr Pit will be necessary to give Stability to the present Ministry.</p><p>The Duke of Richmond coud not appoint me Secretary.</p><p>He coud appoint none but his Brother,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010520a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> without affronting Sir Charles Bunbury, his Brother in law, who had been rejected by Lord Hertford. <span class="linelast">Yours most sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
