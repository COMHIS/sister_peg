	<div id="humedaOU0010145a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Sir</p><p>About six weeks ago, I gave our Friend, Jack Stuart,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010145a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> the Trouble of delivering you a Letter, &amp; some papers<span href="/item/humedaOU0010145a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> enclos'd, which I was desirous to submit to your Criticism &amp; Examination. I say not this by way of Compliment &amp; Ceremonial, but seriously &amp; in good earnest. It is pretty usual for People to be pleas'd with their own Performance, especially in the Heat of Composition; but I have scarcely wrote any thing more whimsical, or whose Merit I am more diffident of.</p><p>But in sending in these Papers, I am afraid that I have taken the least Step towards conveying them to your hand: I shou'd also have wrote you to ask for them, otherwise, perhaps, our Friend may wear them out in his Pocket, &amp; forget the Delivery of them. Be so good, therefore, as to desire them from him, &amp; having read them at your Leizure, return them to him in a Packet, and he will send them to me by the Carrier. You wou'd easily observe what I mention'd to you, that they had a Reference to some other Work, and were not complete in themselves. But, with this Allowance, are they tolerable?</p><p>I wrote a Letter to Mr Mure directed to your Care; but it wou'd come too late for him. Be pleas'd to send it to him, under a new Cover, without any other Direction than that of Member of Parliament at London. For that is sufficient.</p><p class="signoff">I am Dear Sir Yours in [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010145a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> <br /><span class="sig">Dav[id Hume]</span><span href="/item/humedaOU0010145a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p class="datelineb"><span class="loc">Ninewells near Berwick.</span> <br /> <span class="date">10th February 1751.</span></p></div>
