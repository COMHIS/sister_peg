	<div id="humedaOU0010229a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">20<sup>th</sup> April, 1756.</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor,</p><p><span class="linefirst">There is certainly nothing so unaccountable as my long silence with you; that is, with a man whose friendship I desire most to preserve of any I know, and whose conversation I would be the most covetous to enjoy, were I in the same place with him.</span> But to tell the truth, we people in the country (for such you Londoners esteem our city) are apt to be troublesome to you people in town; we are vastly glad to receive letters which convey intelligence to us of things which we should otherwise have been ignorant of, and can pay them back with nothing but provincial stories, which are no way interesting. It was perhaps an apprehension of this kind which held my pen: but really, I believe, the truth is, when I was idle, I was lazy — when I was busy, I was so extremely busy, that I had no leisure to think of any thing else. For, dear Doctor, what have we to do with news on either side, unless it be literary news, which I hope will always interest us? and of these, London seems to me as barren as Edinburgh; or rather more so, since I can tell you that our friend Hume's 'Douglas' is altered and finished, and will be brought out on the stage next winter, and is a singular, as well as fine performance, [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> of the spirit of the English theatre, not devoid of Attic and French elegance. You have sent us nothing worth reading this winter; even your vein of wretched novels is dried up, though not that of scurrilous partial politics. We hear of Sir George Lyttleton's History, from which the populace expect a great deal: but I hear it is to be three quarto volumes. 'O magnum horribilem et sacrum libellum.' — This last epithet of <em>sacrum</em> will probably be applicable to it in more senses than one. However, it cannot well fail to be readable, which is a great deal for an English book nowadays.</p><p>But, dear Doctor, even places more hyperborean than this, more provincial, more uncultivated, and more barbarous, may furnish articles for a literary correspondence. Have you seen the second volume of Blackwell's 'Court of Augustus'?<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> I had it some days lying on my table, and, on turning it over, met with passages very singular for their ridicule and absurdity. He says that Mark Antony, travelling from Rome in a post-chaise, lay the first night at Redstones: I own I did not think this a very classical name; but, on recollection, I found, by the <em>Philippics</em>, that he lay at Saxa Rubra. He talks also of Mark Antony's favourite poet, Mr Gosling, meaning Answer, who, methinks, should rather be called Mr Goose. He also takes notice of Virgil's distinguishing himself, in his youth, by his epigram on Crossbow the robber. Look [into] your Virgil, you'll find that, like other robbers, this man bore various names. Cross-bow is the name he took at Aberdeen, but Balista at Rome. The book has many other flowers of a like nature, which made me exclaim, with regard to the author,</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText">Nec certe apparet . . . utrum <br />Minxerit in patrios cineres, an triste bidental <br />Moverit incestus. Certe furit.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></p></div><p>But other people, who have read through the volume, say that, notwithstanding these absurdities, it does not want merit; and, if it be so, I own the case is still more singular. What would you think of a man who should speak of the mayorality of Mr Veitch; meaning the consulship of Cicero? — Is not this a fine way of avoiding the imputation of pedantry? Perhaps Cicero, to modernize him entirely, should be called Sir Mark Veitch, because his father was a Roman knight.</p><p>I do not find your name among the subscribers of my friend Blacklock's poems; you have forgot; buy a copy of them and read them; they are many of them very elegant, and merit esteem, if they came from any one, but are admirable from him. [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> Spence's industry in so good a work, but there is a circumstance of his conduct that will entertain you. In the Edinburgh edition there was a stanza to this effect:</p><div class="quoteVerse"><p class="verseText">The wise in every age conclude, <br />What Pyrrho taught and Hume renewed, <br />That dogmatists are fools.</p></div><p>Mr Spence would not undertake to promote a London subscription, unless my name, as well as Lord Shaftesbury's (who was mentioned in another place) were erased: the author frankly gave up Shaftesbury, but said that he would forfeit all the profit he might expect from a subscription, rather than relinquish the small tribute of praise which he had paid to a man whom he was more indebted to than to all the world beside. I heard by chance of this controversy, and wrote to Mr Spence, that, without farther consulting the author, I, who was chiefly concerned, would take upon me to empower him to alter the stanza where I was mentioned. He did so, and farther, having prefixed the life of the author, he took occasion to mention some people to whom he had been obliged, but is careful not to name me;<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> judging rightly that such good deeds were only <em>splendida peccata</em>, and that till they were sanctified by the grace of God they would be of no benefit to salvation.</p><p>I have seen (but, I thank God, was not bound to read) Dr [Birch's] 'History of the Royal Society'. Pray make my compliments to him, and tell him, that I am his most obliged humble servant. I hope you understand that the last clause was spoken ironically. You would have surprised <em>him</em> very much had you executed the compliment.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I shall conclude this article of literature by mentioning myself. I have finished the second volume of my History, and have maintained the same unbounded liberty in my politics which gave so much offence: religion lay more out of my way; and there will not be [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> in this particular: I think reason, and even some eloquence, are on my side, and [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> will, I am confident, get the better of faction and folly, which are the [ ]<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> least they never continue long in the same shape. I am sorry, however, that you speak nothing on this head in your postscript to me.</p><p>It gives me great affliction, dear Doctor, when you speak of gouts and old age. Alas! you are going down hill, and I am tumbling fast after you. I have, however, very entire health notwithstanding my studious sedentary life. I only grow fat more than I could wish. When shall I see you? God knows. I am settled here; have no pretensions, nor hopes, nor desires, to carry me to court the great. I live frugally on a small fortune, which I care not to dissipate by jaunts of pleasure. All these circumstances give me little prospect of seeing London. Were I to change my habitation, I would retire to some provincial town in France, to trifle out my old age, near a warm sun in a good climate, a pleasant country, and amidst a sociable people. My stock would then maintain me in some opulence; for I have the satisfaction to tell you, dear Doctor, that on reviewing my affairs, I find that I am worth £1600 sterling, which, at five per cent, makes near 1800 livres a year — that is, the pay of two French captains.</p><p>Edmonstone left this town for Ireland. I wish he were out of the way: he has no prospect of advancement suitable to his merit. Sir Harry, I hope, has only run backwards to make a better jump.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010229a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Pray imitate not my example — delay not to write; or, if you do, I will imitate yours, and write again without waiting for an answer.</p><p><span class="linelast">Ever most sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span></p></div>
