	<div id="humedaOU0010180a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">Edinburgh</span></span> <span class="date">28 of Octr 1753</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor</p><p><span class="linefirst">I know not, if you remember the Giant in Rabelais, who swallow'd, every Morning, a Windmill to Breakfast; and at last was choak'd upon a Pound of melted Butter, hot from an Oven.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span></span> I am going to compare myself to that Giant. I think nothing of dispatching a Quarto in fifteen or eighteen Months; but am not able to compose a Letter once in two Years: And am very industrious to keep up a Correspondence with Posterity, whom I know nothing about, &amp; who probably will concern themselves very little about me; while I allow myself to be forgot by my Friends, whom I value and regard. However, it is some Satisfaction, that I can give you an Account of my Silence, with which, I own, I reproach myself. I have now brought down my History to the Death of Charles the first; and here I intend to pause for some time: To read &amp; think &amp; correct: To look forward &amp; backward: And to adopt the most moderate &amp; most reasonable Sentiments on all Subjects. I am sensible, that the History of [the] two first Stuarts will be most agreeable to the Tories: That of the two last, to the Whigs. But we must endeavour to be above any Regard either to Whigs or Tories.</p><p>Having thus satisfy'd your Curiosity: For I will take it for granted, that your Curiosity extends towards me: I must now gratify my own. I was very anxious to hear, that you had been molested with some Disorders this Summer; I was told, that you expected they wou'd settle into a Fit of the Gout. Tis lucky when that Distemper overtakes a man in his Chariot: We foot walkers make but an awkward Figure with it. I hope no body has the Impertinence to say to you, <em>Physician cure thyself</em>. All the World allows that Privilege to the Gout, that it is not to be cur'd. It is itself a Physician; and of course, sometimes cures and sometimes kills. I fancy one Fit of the Gout wou'd much encrease your Stock of Interjections; and render that part of Speech, which, in common Grammars, is usually the most barren, with you more copious than either Nouns or Verbs.</p><p>I must tell you good News of our Friend, Sir Harry.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> I am informed, that his Talent for Eloquence will not rust for want of Employment: He bids fair for another Seat of the House; &amp; what is the charming Part of the Story, it is General Anstruther's Seat which he is to obtain. He has made an Attack on the General's Burroughs, &amp; by the Assistance of his Uncle's<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Interest &amp; Purse, is likely to prevail. Is not this delicious Revenge? It brings to my Mind the Story of the Italian, who reading that Passage of Scripture, <em>Vengeance is mine saith the Lord</em>; burst forth; <em>Ay to be sure; It is too sweet for any Mortal</em>. I own, I envy Sir Harry: I never can hope to hate any body so perfectly as he does that renown'd Commander: And no Victory, Triumph, Vengeance, Success, can be more compleat. Are not you pleas'd too? Pray, anatomize your own Mind, &amp; tell me how many Grains of your Satisfaction is owing to Malice &amp; how many Ounces to Friendship.</p><p>I leave the rest of this Paper to be filled up by Edmonstone,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> &amp;...<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span> <span class="linelast">Yours most sincerely</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume.</span></p><div class="postscript"><p>After having this by me eight days, I have never been able to meet with Edmonstone. I must therefore send off my own part of a Letter, which we projected in common. I shall only tell you, that I have since seen Mr Oswald, who assures me that Anstruther's Defeat is infallible.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010180a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span></p></div></div>
