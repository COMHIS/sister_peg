	<div id="humedaOU0030185a1c"><p class="salutation">Dear Doctor</p><p><span class="linefirst">I send you enclos'd M. Suard's Letter,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> that you may see I am not singular in my Opinion of your Work.</span> He has now all the second Volume, a great part of the third, and some of the first. I shall supply him regularly.</p><p>I wish the public may not in one particular, meet with a Dissappointment in your Work: They seem to expect, that it is to be more a History of the Age than of the Reign of Charles V; and that the Wars &amp; Negotiations and usual historical Transactions will fill but a small part of it: This Expectation may make them less relish your very elegant Narration: However, you will have something too of what they look for.</p><p>My Commission in France was a mere fancy of the News Writer.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> Mr Walpole Son of Lord Walpole,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> continues in that Employment; and it cou'd not be otherwise. He is a young man, of parts, as they say, and was very lately calld from Spain to be settled in France. It woud have been a great Injustice to remove him. If the Office had been offerd me, I know not but I shoud have been idle enough, even at my Years, to be pleas'd with it. At present, I think every day more seriously of retiring to Edinburgh for Life.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> Every Event here fills me with Indignation, which I cannot command and care not to conceal; and yet to a Philosopher &amp; Historian the Madness and Imbecillity &amp; Wickedness of Mankind ought to appear ordinary Events.</p><p>Lord Chatham<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> immediately upon his Resignation took, or thought proper to take, a real Fit of the Gout, and is now declard to be perfectly recoverd, and is reconcild in form to the Grenville's. People are in amaze what this may prognosticate.</p><p>Crawford<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> speaks of going abroad every day, but is still here. His Health certainly is not good; but he might recover if he woud trust a little more to the Lord, and less to the Physicians. In other respects, he is as you say.</p><p>Have you seen Priestly's<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/007" title="7 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">7</span> Grammar? In his Censure of me, he is wrong nine times in ten, as I am assurd by consulting the best Judges; and his Friend, Johnson,<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/008" title="8 [marked '7' in source]" class="notecall_nts">8</span> is even commonly against him; so negligently did he write. However, you may look into it. The People in this Country wou'd wish to be hypercritical on these points, if they knew how.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Lord &amp; Lady Holdernesse<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/009" title="9 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">9</span> desire to be rememberd to you; as I do to Dr Blair<span href="/item/humedaOU0030185a1c/nts/010" title="10 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">10</span> &amp; your Family.</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D.
