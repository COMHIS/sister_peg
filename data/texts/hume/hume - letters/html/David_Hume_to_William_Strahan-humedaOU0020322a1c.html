	<div id="humedaOU0020322a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc">Bath</span> <span class="date">8 of June 1776.</span></p><p class="salutation">My dear Sir</p><p><span class="linefirst">You will be sorry to hear, that I must retract all the good Accounts, which I gave you of my Health.</span> The Waters, after seeming to agree with me, have sensibly a bad Effect, and I have entirely dropped the Use of them. I wait only Sir John Pringle's Directions before I leave this place;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> and I shall, I believe, set out for the North in a few days. If any Letters for me come under your Cover, be so good as to detain them, till I can inform you of my Route.</p><p>I am glad to find, that you have been able to set about this New Edition in earnest. I have made it extremely correct; at least I believe that, if I were to live twenty Years longer, I shoud never be able to give it any further Improvements. This is some small Satisfaction to me in my present Situation; and I may add that it is almost the only one that my Writings ever afforded me: For as to any suitable Returns of Approbation from the Public, for the Care, Accuracy, Labour, Disinterestedness, and Courage of my Compositions, they are yet to come. Though, I own to you, I see many Symptoms that they are approaching. But it will happen to me as to many other Writers: Though I have reached a considerable Age, I shall not live to see any Justice done to me. It is not improbable, however, that my Self-conceit and Prepossessions may lead me into this way of thinking.</p><p>As soon as this Edition is finished, please to send a Copy of all the ten Volumes<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span> to Sir John Pringle, the same to Mr Gibbon, a Copy of the History to Mistress Elliott in Brewer Street; six Copies of the whole to me in Edinburgh or to my Brother there in case of my Death.</p><p>If this Event shall happen, as is probable, before the Publication of this Edition, there is one Request I have to make to you: Before I left Edinburgh, I wrote a small piece (you may believe it woud be but a small one) which I call the History of my own Life: I desire it may be prefixed to this Edition:<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> It will be thought curious and entertaining. My Brother or Dr Adam Smith will send it to you, and I shall give them Directions to that Purpose.</p><p>I am also to speak to you of another Work more important: Some Years ago, I composed a piece, which woud make a small Volume in Twelves. I call it <em>Dialogues on natural Religion</em>: Some of my Friends flatter me, that it is the best thing I ever wrote. I have hitherto forborne to publish it, because I was of late desirous to live quietly, and keep remote from all Clamour: For though it be not more exceptionable than some things I had formerly published; yet you know some of these were thought very exceptionable; and in prudence, perhaps, I ought to have suppressed them. I there introduce a Sceptic, who is indeed refuted, and at last gives up the Argument, nay confesses that he was only amusing himself by all his Cavils;<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> yet before he is silenced, he advances several Topics, which will give Umbrage, and will be deemed very bold and free, as well as much out of the Common Road. As soon as I arrive at Edinburgh, I intend to print a small Edition of 500, of which I may give away about 100 in Presents; and shall make you a Present of the Remainder, together with the literary Property of the whole, provided you have no Scruple, in your present Situation, of being the Editor: It is not necessary you shoud prefix your Name to the Title Page. I seriously declare, that after Mr Millar and You and Mr Cadell have publickly avowed your Publication of the <em>Enquiry concerning human Understanding</em>, I know no Reason why you shoud have the least Scruple with regard to these Dialogues. They will be much less obnoxious to the Law, and not more exposed to popular Clamour. Whatever your Resolution be, I beg you wou'd keep an entire Silence on this Subject. If I leave them to you by Will, your executing the Desire of a dead Friend, will render the publication still more excusable.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> Mallet never sufferd any thing by being the Editor of Bolingbroke's Works.</p><p>Two posts ago I sent you a Copy of the small Essay which I mentioned.<span href="/item/humedaOU0020322a1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span></p><p>I am Dear Sir with great Regard and Sincerity</p><p> <span class="linelast">Your most obedient humble Servant</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
