	<div id="rousjeVF0310294a1c"><p>[. . .] I am not surpriz'd, that you are displeas'd with what I have done with regard to Jean-Jaques: I am not pleas'd with it myself. But reflect<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span>, that properly speaking I have done nothing: I only gave a discretionary Power to my Friends at Paris to act as they thought proper; because I consider'd, that they were <span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> from their Situation<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> much better judges <span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> than myself<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/002" title="b [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_txt">b</span> of the Propriety &amp; Necessity of the Step I took. I forsaw, that many wou'd doubt of the Propriety of my Conduct: But I was told, that many, from want of Information, believ'd me to have been a Calumniator and a false perfidious Friend. You will own, that there was no Proportion between the one blame &amp; the other.</p><p>You may remember, that there were two pieces publishd in the News pap[ers] of which this Madman accuses me of being the Author; and with regard to the last he says, that he has an intimate and certain Conviction of it. He says they were Libels against him. I cou'd reply nothing but that I had never seen nor read those Pieces. Above a Fortnight ago, I had a Letter from a Swiss Gentleman, who resides in London, one D'yverdun<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked 'a' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span>, a man of Character as I am told: For I never saw him nor heard of him before. This Gentleman informs me, that he was very much surprizd to meet<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/003" title="c [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_txt">c</span> with this Passage in Rousseau's Letter to me: For that he was the Author of the two Pieces; and is willing to acknowlege it to all the World And he gives me leave, in my own Justification, to publish his Letter in any of the public Papers, if I think proper. I sent a Copy of it<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/004" title="d [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">d</span> to Mr Davenport<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked 'b' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> to be delivered to Rousseau, but shall not print it<span href="/item/rousjeVF0310294a1c/txt/005" title="e [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_txt">e</span>; because I do not think that any body pretends to justify my Adversary or to blame me; and any farther Apology seems to be superfluous: I have besides a mortal Aversion to these Publications.
