The last Assembly sat on me. They did not propose to burn me, because they cannot. But they intend to give me over to Satan, which they think they have the power of doing. My friends, however, prevailed, and my damnation is postponed for a twelvemonth. But next Assembly will surely be upon me. Anderson, the godly, spiteful, pious, splenetic, charitable, unrelenting, meek, persecuting, Christian, inhuman, peace-making, furious Anderson, is at present very hot in pursuit of Lord Kames. He has lately wrote a letter to his son, which they say is a curiosity. He mentions his own great age, which leaves him no hopes of being able long to survive the condemnation of that atheistical, however just, judge.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010224a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> He therefore leaves me as a legacy to his son, and conjures him, as he expects his blessing, or the blessing of Heaven, never to cease his pursuit of me till he bring me to condign punishment.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010224a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> <span class="linelast">Is not this somewhat like Hamilcar, who swore Hannibal on the altar to be an eternal enemy to the Roman people?</span></p></div>
