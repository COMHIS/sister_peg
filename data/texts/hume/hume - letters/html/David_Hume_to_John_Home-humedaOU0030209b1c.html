Sallust makes it a question, whether the writer or the performer of good things has the preference and he ascribes the greater praise to the latter. It is happy for you, that you may rest your fame on either. I here allude to what you have done for Ferguson.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030209b1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span></p><p>But, pray, why do you say, that the post of Boston is like the camp of Pirna? I fancy our troops can be withdrawn thence without any difficulty.</p><p>I make no doubt, since you sound the trumpet for war against the Americans, that you have a plan ready for governing them, after they are subdued; but you will not subdue them, unless they break in pieces among themselves — an event very probable. It is a wonder it has not happened sooner. But no man can foretell how far these frenzies of the people may be carried.<span href="/item/humedaOU0030209b1c/txt/001" title="a [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_txt">a</span></p><p>Who is the Author of <em>The Claims of Great Britain asserted</em>?<span href="/item/humedaOU0030209b1c/nts/005" title="5 [marked '5' in source]" class="notecall_nts">5</span> It is said to be Macpherson's: But I neither find in it the Effrontery nor the Absurdity by which that learned Gentleman's Writings are so eminently distinguished. The Pamphlet is not well written; but the Author has been supplyed with tolerable Materials.</p><p>Are you angry with me for what I have said of Macpherson? I have better reason to be angry with you for the Heat you have thrown out against General Conway in your Pamphlet.</p><p>You say nothing to me of Alfred:<span href="/item/humedaOU0030209b1c/nts/006" title="6 [marked '6' in source]" class="notecall_nts">6</span> It may perhaps (but I speak ignorantly) be better for him to be remitted to his Studies.</p><p> <span class="linelast">Yours</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">D.
