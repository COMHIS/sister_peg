	<div id="humedaOU0010439a1c"><p class="datelinef"><span class="loc"><span class="city">[Paris</span></span> <span class="date">April 1764]</span></p><p class="salutation">Dear Edmonstoune,</p><p><span class="linefirst">I was just projecting to write a long letter to you, and another to Mr Vivian,<span href="/item/humedaOU0010439a1c/nts/001" title="1 [marked '1' in source]" class="notecall_nts">1</span> when your last obliging epistle came to hand.<span href="/item/humedaOU0010439a1c/nts/002" title="2 [marked '2' in source]" class="notecall_nts">2</span></span> I immediately put pen to paper, to assure you that the report is entirely groundless, and that I have not lost, nor ever could have lost, a shilling by Fairholm's bankruptcy. Poor John Adams is very deeply engaged with him; but I had a letter last post from Dr Blair, which informs me that he will yet be able to save fifteen or sixteen thousand pounds. I am glad to give you also this piece of intelligence.</p><p>What! do you know that Lord Bute is again all-powerful, or rather that he was always so, but is now acknowledged for such by all the world?<span href="/item/humedaOU0010439a1c/nts/003" title="3 [marked '3' in source]" class="notecall_nts">3</span> Let this be a new motive for Mr Vivian to adhere to the ecclesiastical profession, in which he may have so good a patron; for civil employments for men of letters can scarcely be found: all is occupied by men of business, or by parliamentary interest.</p><p>It is putting too great a respect on the vulgar, and on their superstitions, to pique one's self on sincerity with regard to them. Did ever one make it a point of honour to speak truth to children or madmen? If the thing were worthy being treated gravely, I should tell him, that the Pythian oracle, with the approbation of Xenophon, advised every one to worship the gods — <span lang="grc">νομω πολεως</span> .<span href="/item/humedaOU0010439a1c/nts/004" title="4 [marked '4' in source]" class="notecall_nts">4</span> I wish it were still in my power to be a hypocrite in this particular. The common duties of society usually require it; and the ecclesiastical profession only adds a little more to an innocent dissimulation, or rather simulation, without which it is impossible to pass through the world. Am I a liar, because I order my servant to say, I am not at home, when I do not desire to see company?</p><p>How could you imagine that I was Under-Secretary to Lord Hertford, or that I could ever be prevailed on to accept of such a character? I am not Secretary at all, but do the business of Secretary to the Embassy without any character. Bunbury has the commission and appointments: a young man of three or four and twenty, somewhat vain and ignorant, whom Lord Hertford refused to accept of, as thinking he would be of no use to him. The King gave me a pension of £200 a year for life, to engage me to attend his Lordship. My Lord is very impatient to have me Secretary to the Embassy; and writes very earnest letters to that purpose to the ministers, and, among the rest, to Lord Bute. He engaged me, somewhat against my will, to write also to such of my friends as had credit with that favourite, Oswald, Elliot, Sir Harry, and John Hume. The King has promised that my Lord Hertford shall soon be satisfied in this particular; and yet, I know not how, I suspect that some obstacle will yet interpose; tho nothing can be more scandalous, than for a man to enjoy the revenue of an office, which is exercised by another. Mr Bunbury has great interest, being married to a sister of the Duke of Richmond, and sister-in-law to Lord Holland. The appointments of this office are above £1000 a year, and the expense attending it nothing; and it leads to all the great employments. I wait the issue with patience, and even with indifference. At my years, and with my fortune, a man with a little common sense, without philosophy, may be indifferent about what happens.</p><p> <span class="linelast">I am, dear Edmonstoune, <br />Yours sincerely,</span></p><p class="signoff"><span class="sig">David Hume</span>.</p></div>
