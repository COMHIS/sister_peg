Sir,

I did write you the very first occasion after I came out hither. But I find my letters have great difficulty to reach you; for which reason I shall put this into the post-house myself, to prevent such practices as I suspect are us'd in this family. I have some reason also to think that spies are plac'd upon my most indifferent actions. I told you that I had had more conversation with one of the servants than was natural, and for what reason. Perhaps this fellow had the same privilege granted him as other spies, to rail against his employer, in order to draw in an unguarded man to be still more unguarded. But such practices, if real (for I am not altogether certain), can only turn to the confusion of those who use them. Where there is no arbitrary power, innocence must be safe; and if there be arbitrary power in this family, 'tis long since I knew I cou'd not remain in it. What a scene is this for a man nourish'd in philosophy and polite letters to enter into, all of a sudden, and unprepar'd! But I can laugh, whatever happens; and the newness of such practices rather diverts me. At first they caus'd indignation and hatred; and even (tho' I am asham'd to confess it) melancholy and sorrow.

Your friend has recover'd his colic; but is fallen into a fit of very low spirits and vapours. I wish this may not hold him long. I know not whether you wou'd choose to come out, while he is in this condition. You may command the chaise and horses at any time. I am, Sir, with great regard, your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume.

 Saturday.
