Sir

One of your Apprentices, by your Order, wrote me on a Cover that, as soon as the Impression of the Essays was over, you intended to write to me. I hope you will excuse me for putting you in mind of this Promise. Your Letters gave me always so much Satisfaction, that I am very desirous of hearing from you.

I have not got the corrected Copies of the three last Sheets. I must therefore desire you to send them to me: Otherwise that Copy will be lost and useless

I am Sir

Your most obedient humble Servant 
David Hume
