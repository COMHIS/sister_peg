Dear Sir,

Since I wrote you last, I have receivd a Letter from Mr Millar, which has been entirely to my Satisfaction; and we have settled all the Terms; I hope, to both our Advantages.

Please send the enclos'd to Mr Oswald at Wandesworth by the Penny Post; along with as many Covers, directed to me, as you think you will have occasion for. He will frank them & return them to you. I take it for granted that one pays no more than a Penny for a Parcel that goes by the penny post: For otherwise it will be better to send my Letter & the Covers to the Lobby of the House.

 I am 
Dear Sir 
Your most humble Servant

I am told that Mr Dalrymple is not in Town at present
