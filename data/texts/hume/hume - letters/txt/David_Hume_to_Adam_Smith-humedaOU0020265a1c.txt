[October 1772.]

My dear Sir

Yours came to hand, while I was in the Country where I should have been still, had it not been for a Letter of the French Ambassador, who expected to see me here in Town: He is lookd for to morrow Evening. As soon as I came to Town, I ask'd the Question you proposd; and was told by Sir William Forbes, that tho' they did not commonly take the Air Notes, yet he woud upon your Account: You may therefore send them over by the first Opportunity. I think that Bank more discredited by the last Step than by all their former Operations. They pretend to open at Air, in order to have a Pretence for striking off any farther Interest but as soon as great Sums are demanded, they pretend, that they are only to change small Notes for the Circulation of the Country; & so refuse Payment: This is in effect shutting up again: They do not seem to have forseen, that it was the Interest of the two Banks here and of all the Bankers to make a Run upon them; for which they ought to have been prepar'd. As far as I can learn, the Duke of Queensberry alone signs the Bonds of Annuity in his own Name; but it is imagind that the Duke of Buccleugh, Mr Douglas &c, have enterd into an Agreement to bear their Share: Otherwise it were Madness in him; & indeed not very wise in him & them in any case. I had last post a Letter from Andrew Stuart: I do not like the present Situation of that Supervisorship. Six to go from Europe, three to join them in the Indies: Corruption will get in among them; and probably Absurdity & Folly. And at best nine Persons can never do any Business. He tells me, that Ferguson is sure of going out Secretary. I wish it may be so. It will be a great Vexation and Disappointment to him to return to his Office with which he was before somewhat disgusted.

 Yours
