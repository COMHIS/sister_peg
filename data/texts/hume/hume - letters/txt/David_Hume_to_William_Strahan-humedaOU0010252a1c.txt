[June 1757]

Dr Sir

I am positive not to reply a single Word to Dr Hurd; and I also beg of you not to think of it. His Artifices or Forgeries, call them which you please, are such common things in all Controversy that man woud be ridiculous who woud pretend to complain of them; and the Parsons in particular have got a License to practice them. I therefore beg of you again to let the Matter pass over in Silence. I have deliverd to Mr Becket a Volume of Essays.

 I am Yours

D. H.
