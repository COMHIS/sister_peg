Dear Colonel

You will receive by this Post a Letter I have wrote to Mr Hume-Campbell; which please read, & if you approve of it, deliver it when & where you think proper. You will see him every day in the House of Commons, where you may tell him the State of our Case, & instruct him in proper Topics & proper Persons, better than I can do at this Distance.

Please also to read the enclos'd to the Doctor, & send it off, if you think proper. I receiv'd only Jemmy Abercromby's to-day, & have wrote to Oswald, & Charles Erskine, & the Colonel. You may speak to Tom Wilson yourself, who will also be useful to us. I wrote to him some time ago.

I think this will do as well as my coming to London. I am in a violent Hurry, going off to Edinburgh to morrow early: So excuse want of Accuracy which being all exhausted, in my elaborate Letter to Mr Hume[-Campbell], I am glad to relax myself a little with you. My Compliments to Mrs Abercromby, & Mr Fraser; that is, if you converse with him; that is, if he be at all conversible. I am Dear Col.

 Your most affectionate humble Servant

David Hume.

Ninewells Nov 12th 1747

P.S. I shall be here again in a few days.
