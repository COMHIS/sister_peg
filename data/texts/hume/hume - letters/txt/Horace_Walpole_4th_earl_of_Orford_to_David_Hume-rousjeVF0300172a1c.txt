Dear Sr

Your Set of litterary Friends are what a Set of litterary Men are apt to be, exceedingly absurd. They hold a Consistory to consult how to argue with a madman; and they think it very necessary for your Character to give them the pleasure of seeing Rousseau exposed, not because He has provoked you, but them. If Rousseau prints, you must; but I certainly would not, till He does.

 I cannot be precise as to the time of my writing the King of Prussia's letter, but I do assure you with the utmost truth that it was several days before you left Paris, & before Rousseau's arrival there, of which I can give you a strong proof; for I not only suppressed the letter while you staid there, out of delicacy to you; but it was the reason why, out of delicacy to myself, I did not go to see him, as you often proposed to me; thinking it wrong to go & make a cordial visit to a man, with a letter in my pocket to laugh at him. You are at full liberty, dear Sr, to make use of what I say in your Justification, either to Rousseau or any body else. I should be very sorry to have you blamed on my account; I have a hearty contempt of Rousseau, & am perfectly indifferent what the Litterati of Paris think of the matter. If there is any fault, which I am far from thinking, let it lie on me. No parts can hinder my laughing at their Possessor if He is a Mountebank. If He has a bad & most ungrateful heart, as Rousseau has shown in your case, into the bargain, he will have my Scorn likewise, as he will of all good and sensible men. You may trust your Sentence to Such, who are as respectable Judges, as any that have pored over ten thousand more Volumes.

yrs most sincerely

Hor. Walpole

P.S. I will look out the letter and the dates as soon as I go to Strawberry-hill.
