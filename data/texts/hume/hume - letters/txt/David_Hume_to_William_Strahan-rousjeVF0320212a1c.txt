[. . .] If Becket has a few Copies to spare of the French Edition of my Controversy with Rousseau, I should be glad to have three or four of them.

There was a good pleasant Paper, inserted, I believe in your Chronicle, about three months ago. It containd Rousseau's Articles of Charge against me, and then some good humourd Raillery against him and Voltaire and me. I should be glad to have two or three Copies of it, if you can readily find them.

I know not if Becket printed Voltaire's Letter to me, but if he did he may perhaps have two or three Copies to spare, which woud oblige me.

I am Dr Sir Yours sincerely

D.H.
