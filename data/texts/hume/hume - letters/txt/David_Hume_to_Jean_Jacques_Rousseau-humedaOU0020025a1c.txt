[10–17 March, 1766]

Dear Sir

The Bearer, Mr Gosset, an ingenious Artist, is desirous to have a Model of you, at the earnest Application of several Gentlemen, who wish to adorn their Closets with it. He assures me, that it will not cost you above half an hour to sit to him. I coud not refuse so reasonable a Request; and I hope you will excuse this Liberty. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume

P.S.

Mr Davenport tells me, that there is a Retour Chaise for Ashburn. He has made a Bargain for you and Mlle Le Vasseur. It goes off on Wednesday Morning; and he will send his Coach for you on Tuesday Evening.

To Mr Rousseau at Mr Pulleyn's Grocer in Chiswick
