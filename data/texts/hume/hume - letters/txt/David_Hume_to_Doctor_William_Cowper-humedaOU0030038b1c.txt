Sir

I acknowledge myself to be very much oblig'd to you for the Information, which you have had the Goodness to convey to me. The Proofs, which you give me, convince me of my Mistake, when I asserted, that the King was at Shrewsbury, when he receiv'd Intelligence of the Action at Powick-Bridge near Worcester. The King had marchd along with the Army from Nottingham to Shrewsbury, where the Army then lay: No Historian had mention'd his leaving the Army to go to Chester. This had led me into the Mistake, which I shall take Care to correct by the first Opportunity.

I am likewise sensible of the other Mistakes, which you take notice of. I doubt not but many more wou'd occur to you in reading my History; and those more material. I always esteem myself much oblig'd to any one, that informs me of my Errors; and so far am not unworthy of the Favor you have conferr'd on me. Farther Favors of the same kind shall always be gratefully acknowleg'd.

I am Sir

Your most obedient & most humble Servant 
David Hume.
