Dear obstinate David

Will nothing move you, you obdurate Philosopher, Your Reasons are not worth a Straw, and Ill prosecute you for scandalizing my House.

Pravum et tenacem propositi virum 
Non Civium Ardor recta jubentium 
Non Vultus instantis Baronnæ 
Mente quatit Stolida.







The Room next to your last is as cool as any Room ought to be, it looks to the North, and you was putt into a South Room merely because it was thought that the Sun's vivifying Ray would be of Use to a Man that had been worn out and so much epuisé in ffrance. Besides you Scrub, have I not see you basking for Hours together in the Sun, contemplating Shellie, and burning with Envy at his Prowess, and I heard Nothing about your being heated till we came to Killin, and that was Crichen's doing, to season you for still a hotter Place. It is pleasant to hear a Man reputed to be a Contemptor Divum, talk of Vows and religiously keeping them. You know what Benedict the 14 said to Madame Capello, the Venetian Ambassadress whom you saw at London in the same Quality, she it seems had receivd a very fine Watch from the Cardinal Sciarra Colonna, and wanted to show it to the Pope, but could not readily unhook it, upon which he said to her, Lasciate, laciate , deve sempre il Voto esser di rempello [?] al Santo; Now David, what thing have you vow'd and to what Divinity have you dedicated it. Have you after all your Fatti d'arme and all your Triumphs grown tird of Conquest and hung up your Arms in some poor Chapel, for one that was only armé a la legere, cant furnish any more. As you don't seem to have your usual Clearness about Vows if youll come with Mrs Mure on Wednesday the 19th the Baron & she will give [you] more distinct Ideas about them . . . .
