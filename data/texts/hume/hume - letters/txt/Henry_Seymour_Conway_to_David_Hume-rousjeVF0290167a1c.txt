Gnr: Conway's compliments to Mr Hume & acquaints him that in consequence of what he heard from him he has this day spoke to his Majesty on the subject of Monsr Rousseau, & that his M: is pleas'd to consent to give him a Pension of one hundred pounds per an: â€” desiring only it might be a private one.

G. C.  does not know Monsr Rousseau's direction & therefore begs Mr Hume to inform him in his name that he has his M's orders to make him this offer & that if it is agreable to him he shall think himself extremely happy to have been an instrument in providing him any convenience or satisfaction & in having contributed to procure for one of his distinguish'd Genius & Merit those marks of favour and protection which will do honour to this Country & in a particular manner to the Royal hand from whence this bounty flows.
