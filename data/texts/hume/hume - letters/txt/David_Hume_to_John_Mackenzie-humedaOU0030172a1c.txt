Dear Sir

Some few Weeks ago, I had a Letter dated at Strickathro near Brechin, signd John Mackenzie, recommending a Person, whose Name does not this Moment recur to me, to be Minister of one of Lord Fortrose's Churches in the Isle of Lewis. I apply'd to General Conway, who procurd the King's Presentation, that is now lying in the Office to be taken out. But as I am not acquainted with your hand writing, I did not know, whether this Letter came from my good Friend, Dr John Mackenzie or from you: I only have heard, that the Dr has a house in that part of the Country. I have answerd both of you; as indeed, the Application seemd to me entirely reasonable, from whatever hand it came: And it was a Pleasure to me to oblige either

I am 
Dear Sir 
Your most obedient & most humble Servant 
David Hume
