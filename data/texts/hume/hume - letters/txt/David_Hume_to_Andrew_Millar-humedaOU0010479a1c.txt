Dear Sir

Le Roy wants Cc in Letter Press.

Above two Months ago, I sent over by Dr Huck, who lives in Chidley Court, Pall Mall, all the Sheets wanting in your Copies of Le Roy's Plans of Athens; and I desird him to deliver them to you. Before he got to London, he had forgot, and imagin'd that I had desird him to deliver them to David Wilson. Dr Huck lately wrote me, desiring me to put that Matter right: You will please to send to him or to call upon him; and he will deliver you the Sheets. Make my Compliments to him and let him know, that, if I do not write to him myself, it is only to save him trouble.

One of the Copies you sent me of the Octavo Edition of my History wants the two first Sheets of Q. Elizabeth's Reign, which you will please to send me, directed under Cover to Lord Hertford in Northumberland House.

Do not make any new Edition of the Stuarts without consulting me. I should be glad to know how many Copies are dispos'd of, both of the Octavo Edition of my History and of my Essays. I beg my Compliments to Mrs. Millar. I saw Rouet at Fontainebleau in good Health and Spirits; where we rememberd you & Mrs Millar. He goes with Lord Hope to the South of France, for the Recovery of My Lord's Health, which is not entirely good. I am Yours most sincerely
