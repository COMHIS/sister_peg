Sir,

I am desir'd by my Lord to make his compliments to you, and to express his concern for your illness. I hope it is now over in a great measure. My Lord himself does not recover so well as cou'd be wisht. Your company wou'd always be agreeable here; but more so at present, as it wou'd be a mark of your total recovery. I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient Servant.
