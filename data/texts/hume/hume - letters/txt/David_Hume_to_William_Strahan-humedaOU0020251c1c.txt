Dear Sir

I have writ this Post to Fraser, whose Conduct has very much disappointed me. But if he delays a moment, we can easily do without him. You need only send me the Proof Sheet under any Frank, Dr Franklin's or Mr Pulteneys or Mr Wedderburn's or Lord Beauchamps or Mr Conway's (Who I hope, by the bye, has receivd the Copy of my History). The other Sheets are in a great measure superfluous: Especially as I have a Copy of the Edition, from which this is taken.

I am glad to find, that the abominable Faction in England is declining. The People never tire of Folly, but they tire of the same Folly: And if their Leaders fall into the Contempt they deserve, it will be very great indeed. I hope that Pitt will have the Gout this whole Session and I pray it may be a hearty and sincere one.

I do not think, that you will be able to publish this Session; unless the printing of the four last Volumes be well advancd. But as I have at last been able to get one correct Edition of that work, I am more indifferent. I am sensible, it is an idle Amusement; but still it is an Amusement to think that Posterity will do me more Justice than the present Age, whose Suffrage indeed coud not have given me great Vanity.

I wish you saw (as I hope you will) my new House and Situation in St Andrews Square: You woud not wonder that I have abjurd London for ever.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.

 2d Jany 1772.

P.S.

Lord Lyttleton has been so good as to send me the two last Volumes of his Henry II. It woud flatter his Lordship to say that it is truly a Christian Performance.
