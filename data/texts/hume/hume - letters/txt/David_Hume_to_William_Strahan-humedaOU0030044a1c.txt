Sir,

You have forgot to send me a Copy of the Index, Contents, & Title Page of the Volume of my Pieces, which you printed: Without this, all the Sheets formerly sent, would be incompleat. I must therefore desire the Favor of you to send me that Copy.

Mr Millar seems to have some Intention of printing another Edition in twelves. It will probably be sent to your Press; at least, I wish it may: For I find you correcter than any London Printer whom I have try'd. In that case, I shall send you a Copy of some very trifling Alterations I propose to make. I am

Sir 
Your most obedient Servant
