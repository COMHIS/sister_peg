Portsmouth.  May 23. 1746.

Dear Sollicitor

A Letter you have good Reason to expect from me before my Departure for America; but a long one, you cannot look for, if you consider that I knew not a Word of this Matter till Sunday last at Night, that we shall begin to embark from hence in two or three days, & that I had very ingeniously stript myself of every thing, by sending down my whole Baggage for Scotland on Sunday Morning. Such a Romantic Adventure, & such a Hurry, I have not heard of before. The Office is very genteel, 1 osh a day, Perquisites, & no Expences. Remember me kindly to your Brothers. Tell Frank I ask him ten thousand Pardons. Let Mr Dysert & Mrs Dysert know of my good Wishes. Be assur'd yourself of my Friendship. I cannot leave Europe without giving you one Instance of it, & so much the greater that with regard to any other Person but you, it wou'd be a dangerous one. In short, I have been told, that the Zeal of Party has been apt sometimes to carry you too far in your Expressions, & that Fools are afraid of your Violence in your new Office. Seek the Praise, my dear Sandy, of Humanity & Moderation. Tis the most durable, the most agreeable, & in the end the most profitable. I am Dear Sandy Yours most sincerely

David Hume.

For God's sake, think of Willy Hamilton.

Write to me always under Cover to James Oswald Esq. who will best know how to direct to me.
