Edinburgh, 17 Nov. 1772

Dear Sir

I have heard of an excellent House for you which will probably be empty next Whitsuntide. It consists of five chearful Rooms, three of good Size: It is the first Story of that Land at the Play-house in which my Brother lives. It looks along Princes Street; has a Prospect of the Castle and Castle-hill, and all Fields to the West; of the Calton Hill, the Sea, Arthur's Seat, and even, I believe Kirkaldy to the East: Its rent is 35 pound: Shall I bespeak it for you? Have you Resolution enough to determine Yourself for your good?

Yours 
David Hume



P.S.

You once asked me for an account of the Money imported into Spain: I send you the enclosd Scrawl, which is all I can find out about it! But I found at the time it concurd very exactly with an Account I had given of it, I know not where. It was Count Zinzendorf gave me this Account!
