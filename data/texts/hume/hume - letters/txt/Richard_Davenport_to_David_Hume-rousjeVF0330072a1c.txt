Dear Sir,



I can't help giving you the trouble of this — Last night I received a most melancholy letter from Poor Rousseau, dated Spalding in Lincolnshire, how or on what account he got to that place I cant for the life of me guess but this I learn, that he is most excessively sick of his Situation & is returning to Wootton as soon as I suppose he can well get there. He has been all the time at an Inn in that Town. Pray was the place you mentioned to me in that County any where near Spalding. I own to you I was quite moved to read his mournful Epistle. I am quite confirm'd in my Opinion of him — this last from him, is intirely different in Style from any I ever yet receiv'd — 



I have in my answer desired he would write to some friend of his in Town, to authorize him to receive his Majestys Bounty, as it becomes due. I have told him that his Agent must apply & shew his letter to Mr. Lownds of the treasury.



Poor Rousseau writes of nothing but his misery, illness, afflictions, in a word of his being the most unfortunate man that ever existed. Good God most of these distresses are surely occasion'd by his own unhappy temper which I really believe is not in his power to alter, so let him be where he will, I fear he is certain to be uneasy.



His passion for Botany has as I conjecture almost left him. If I'm right in my Guess, I have no sort of doubt, but he will again take to his pen as tis impossible for his imagination to remain idle.

I am Dear Sir

Your Most Obedient 
Humble Servant 
Rich. Davenport
