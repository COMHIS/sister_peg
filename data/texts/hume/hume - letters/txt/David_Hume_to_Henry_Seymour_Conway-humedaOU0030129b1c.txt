Paris 13th of Novr 1765.

Sir

I have the Honour of transmitting to your Excellency the Duke of Praslin's Letter to me with the several Enclosures, which I communicated to the Duke of Richmond.

As soon as his Grace has been presented to the King and royal Family of France, I shall set out for England; and hope to have there the Honour of receiving your Excellency's farther Orders. I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard, Sir

 Your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble Servant
