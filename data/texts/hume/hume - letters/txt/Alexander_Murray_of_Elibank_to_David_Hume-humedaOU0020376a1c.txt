My dearest Cousin

[. . .] My affair ought to be determin'd this week, and nothing can prevent it, but some infernal hibernian cabal. The judges have hitherto, I will venture to say, paid too much regard to their intrigues and lyes; first in permitting such an unparallel'd process, secondly after an information of fifteen months, to grant them a delay of three months to produce further proofs or rather falsehoods; that time being now expired, and my enemy's not having dared to alledge any new proofs, knowing that the letters, and different receipts of Bankiers, which by a miracle I found amongst my papers, put my affair in so clear a light that any additional lyes could not have any manner of effect. I must therefore now intreat my dearest cousin and most generous of friends to write a letter to M. Le Noir and beg him to be the rapporteur of my affair, and to render me that reparation of honneur, which the enormity of the injury and insult done to a man of my birth demands, and I really think I might say character, this being the first thing that was ever laid to my charge, and being perfectly conscious never to have done any one action that could make Your cousin or a descendant of my family blush. As You are no stranger to the important and delicate transactions I have been intrusted with, the superior sentiments of Your soul must make You feel more sensibly, than all others, the most unexpressible agony I have suffered these eighteen months past in languishing under such an imputation. I am fully convinced You will write in the Strongest terms to M. Le Noir, and take such other measures as You think most probable to engage him to charge himself with the rapport of my process and press him to finish it [. . .] .
