Paris 16th of march 1766.

[. . .] I am very glad to hear that you have not occasion to repent of the kindness you have shown to M Rousseau. I in particular never had any reason to complain of his conduct. I wish some friends, whom I value very much, had no more reasons to complain of his unfair proceedings, printed imputations, ungratefulness &c. Immediately after his departure from this place there was a report spread that M Diderot had in vain endeavourd to see Mr Rousseau on purpose to have an explanation, but that the latter boasted of having flatly denied the request of the former. Besides M Rousseau, instead of falsely accusing Mr Grimm or Suffering him to be accused of ingratitude, shoud remember the many Services he has receiv'd at his hands, and that he has authentick proofs of his own ingratitude. The best for him will be to forget entirely or to let alone people that don't deserve any bad treatment, as Rousseau himself will be convinced if he consults his conscience. For my part I wish heartily he may find in your country that repose his Imagination & the Sourness of his temper have deprived him of hitherto.

[. . .] We have no News in the republick of letters. The Dutch have Sent, very likely, to Engelland Some copies of Boulanger's Antiquité dévoilée in 3 vol, which you have read in manuscript.

M & Me Helvetius, abbé Morellet, MM Diderot & Grimm de St Lambert and Suard desire their best compliments to you. We are told that Made Geoffrin is going to Poland to make a visit to her Royal friend there [. . .]. M Suard has indeed ventur'd into wedlock. Mr Grimm pay's his most sincere thanks for the piece of service you did about Rousseau's manuscript. [. . .]

I am very Dear Sir your most affectionate humble Servant

D'Holbach
