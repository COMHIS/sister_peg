Dear Sir

As I have not heard from you; I suspect that you have not yet got the Paris Edition of my Pamphlet. I have therefore sent you the Manuscript of Rousseau's long Letter with all the Notes such as I wish them to be printed; excepting the Note which I sent you in a Paper apart, and which must be inserted. Mr Rousseau's Notes must be printed in Italics to distinguish them from mine; and you must advertise the Reader of this Precaution, in order to prevent Confusion. Even tho' you shoud have got the Paris Edition rather follow the Manuscript, if it be not too late. The Paris Editors have added a Preface and a Declaration of M. D'Alembert, and a Latin Motto at the end. You must not publish the Pamphlet without these. If you have not got that Edition I shall send it you; tho' I wish you coud rather get it in London.

I am Dear Sr Yours sincerely
