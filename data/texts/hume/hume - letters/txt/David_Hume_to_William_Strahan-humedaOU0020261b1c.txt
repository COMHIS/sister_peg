Dear Sir

You will please to send this Letter to Mr Cadel, which I have left open for your Perusal.

There is a Friend of mine, Capn Braiden, who has writ, in the form of Letters, his Travels thro Sicily and Malta: They are very curious and agreeable; and I as well as others of his Friends have advisd him to publish them; and I also advisd him, to carry them to you. If you read them I hope we shall agree in Opinion. I conjecture they may make one Volume a little less than a Volume of the Spectator.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.
