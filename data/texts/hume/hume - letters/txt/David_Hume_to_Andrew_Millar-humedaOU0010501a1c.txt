My dear Sir

As soon as I heard of poor Mallet's Death, my Curiosity was excited to know, whether he had really proceeded any length in his Work, or whether, as many People imagine and as is somewhat my Opinion, he had never wrote a Line nor taken a Note with regard to it. I beg you wou'd make some Enquiry upon that Subject. The Widow will be able to inform you. I shoud be glad to know whether any Lights coud be got from that Quarter for the Continuance of my Work.

I shall be obligd to you, if you will send me a Copy stitchd of Fitz-Osborne's Letters. Please to put it up in a Packet directed to Lord Hertford, and send it to Lord Hallifax's Office. I am very sincerely,

 Dear Sir 
Your most obedient Servant
