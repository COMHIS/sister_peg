Paris 22 Decr 1764.

My Lord

This Letter will be deliver'd to your Lordship by Monsieur de Brequigny, the Gentleman sent over by the King of France to search out such Papers in England, as may have a Reference to the History of this Country. As I knew, that your Lordship is both willing and more able than any man in England to render Service to all ingenious, inquisitive Men, such as he is, I was surprized to find that he had never had the Honour to be presented to you. I hope, that your Lordship will excuse the Liberty I now take in giving him a Letter of Recommendation, or rather of Introduction to your Lordship. The Merits and Character of the Gentleman are so well known as to need no Recommendation.

 I have the Honour to be My Lord 
Your Lordships most obedient and most 
humble Servant
