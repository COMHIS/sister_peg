Dear Sir

About ten days ago, I wrote both to you and Monsr Rousseau; tho' I fancy my Letters have miscarry'd. The Reason of my Suspicion, that some of the Covers you left me are wrong directed by Mistake; and I am afraid I might thro inadvertance have made use of one of these. If so, be so good as to inform me, that I may correct the Mistake, and write him again on the same Subject. I am with great Sincerity

Dear Sir

Your most obedient & most humble Servant
