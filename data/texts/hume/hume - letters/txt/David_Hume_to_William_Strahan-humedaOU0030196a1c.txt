St Andrews Square 26 of October 1772

Dear Sir

I am glad you are so near finishing this new Edition, and approve very much the time of Publication. I wish to give you an Errata; and therefore beg of you, as soon as the last Volume is finishd, to send me a Copy of those four Volumes without the Index: If no other Opportunities offer, please send it by the Waggon: It will come time enough for me to send you an Errata before the Publication; and that we may be surer, I cou'd wish you woud hasten on the printing of the last Volume.

It pleases me to hear, that Affairs settle in London, and that the Mob are likely to be no longer predominant. I wish, that People do not take a Disgust at Liberty; a word, that has been so much profand by these polluted Mouths, that men of Sense are sick at the very mention of it. I hope a new term will be invented to express so valuable and good a thing.

It is some time since I dreaded the Issue of this Plan of Supervisorship for our Friends. I fear that the Dissappointment will be more severe on Ferguson than on Andrew Stuart. But the Moment that delays were interpos'd, it was to be apprehended that Factions wou'd creep in, and dissappoint the Project

 I am Dear Strahan 
Yours sincerely



David Hume
