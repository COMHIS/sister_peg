London 1 March, 1767

There has happened, dear Madam, a small change in my situation and fortune since I wrote to you. I was then very deeply immersed in study, and thought of nothing but of retreat and indolence for the rest of my life, when I was surprized with a letter from Lord Hertford, urging me to come to London, and accept of the office of Depute-Secretary of State under his brother. As my Lord knew that this step was contrary to the maxims which I had laid down to myself, he engaged my Lady Hertford to write me at the same time, and to inform me how much she and my Lord desired my compliance. I sate down, once or twice, to excuse myself; but I own I could not find terms to express my refusal of a request made by persons, to whose friendship I had been so much obliged. I foresaw also, that a place was offered me of credit and confidence; that it connected me with General Conway, one of the best men, in every respect, of this country; and that my continuance in place was likely to be very short, both because of the usual fluctuations of power in this country, and because the General, I know, was only waiting an opportunity of returning from the civil, to his usual military line. Behold me, then, embarked for some time in state affairs; and my former chains, from old friends and family connexions, exchanged for others, of a less durable nature. For I do not suspect myself, at my years, and after such established habits of retreat, of being ensnared by this glimpse of court favour to commence a new course of life, and relinquish my literary ambition for the pursuit of riches and honours in the state. On the contrary, I feel myself at present like a banished man in a strange country; I mean, not as I was while with you at Paris, but as I should be in Westphalia or Lithuania, or any place, the least to my fancy in the world.

 I have seen Lord Holdernesse since I came to London, and immediately commenced a conversation about you: I think it is a cement of friendship between his Lordship and me, that we are of the same sentiments on that head.
