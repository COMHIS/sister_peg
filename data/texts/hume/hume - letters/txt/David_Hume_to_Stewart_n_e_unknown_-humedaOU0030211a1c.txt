Edinburgh 16 of July 1776

Dear Madam

I have been so long in answering your very obliging Letter, because my Intention was, in arriving here, immediatly to have set out on new Jaunts and Journies, and to have seen you at Gillan some time last week: But by repeated Experience I have found, that Motion and Exercise do not suit my present Habit of Body, and my Physicians have agreed, that I shoud remain at [rest?], till it be somewhat amended. As soon as I came to this Resolution, I thought [p]roper to inform you of it, that, if there be any Business in which I can be of Use to you, you may either inform me of it by Letter, or take an Opportunity of coming to town for that purpose. My House is occupy'd at present either by my Nephew or by a Friend, who goes and comes; so that I cannot desire you to be my Lodger, as I coud wish; but I hope, that, except in the Night, we shall have almost entirely your Company. My Compliments to your Sister and Mr Cochrane

 I am Dear Madam 
Your most obedient humble Servant



David Hume
