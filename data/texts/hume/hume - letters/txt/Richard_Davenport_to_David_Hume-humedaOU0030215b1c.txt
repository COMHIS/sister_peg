Dear Sir,

I have not since I wrote, seen Rousseau. I fear you form a true Judgment of him, to mention Dreams, Suspicions &c. Good God in one half quarter of a small sheet I could have easily sum'd up all, but fairly own I was asham'd to put [th]em upon paper. If I have the pleasure of Seeing you perhaps you'll hear Some Anecdotes that will (I cant say after what he has wrote) Surprize you, for in troth they are quite of the Same stamp. They are some small altercations which happened between him, Mademoiselle & our Women.

 I am Dear Sir Your Most Obedient Humble Servant
