Dear Sir

I am much oblig'd to you for your Attention in returning me the Proof Sheets: But I never doubted of your Exactness in following my Corrections which were also, in part, your own. I had unfortunately bespoke most of the Smith Work of my new house; but I still found a small Job to give Mr Richardson, who seems to me a clever young Fellow. I remove in little more than two Months. If I find my Time lie heavy on my hands, I may, for my Amusement, undertake a reign or two after the Revolution. But I believe, in case of my composing any more, I had better write something that has no Reference to the Affairs of these factious Barbarians.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

D. H.
