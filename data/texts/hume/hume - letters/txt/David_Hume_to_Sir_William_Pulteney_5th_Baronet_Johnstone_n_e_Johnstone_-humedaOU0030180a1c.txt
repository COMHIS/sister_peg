[London 19 Nov. 1767]

Dear Sir

I communicated your Idea to General Conway who seems to relish it very much, and will be oblig'd to you for the Calculations which you propos'd to make: He also desird me to tell you, that he wishes you woud turn your Thoughts to the Question, whether it woud be better to confine the Company to a Dividend of 10 or 12 1/2 per cent, till the time of the Payment of their Bond Debts, and that you woud weigh all that can be said on both Sides: He proposes to ask the Favour of a Conversation with you on that Subject, and woud be glad to find you prepard to give him the best Information.

 I am ever Yours

David Hume
