Dear Strahan

I am extremely oblig'd to you for your account of the Debate in the House of Peers: It is very judicious and accurate and impartial, as usual. I now begin to entertain strong hopes, that the King will weather this Tempest, and that the Infamy of Calumny, Faction, Madness and Disorder will at last fall on those heads, who merit it. The Ministry are much better advis'd not to give nor even to take Provocation, than they seem to have been by the Paper of Ruffhead's which you sent me last Autumn. And as every obnoxious Person is turnd out, the King's Resolution is visible to support his Ministry, and men will either acquiesce or return to the ordinary, parliamentary Arts of Opposition. I apprehend, however, that, before the Session ends, this abandon'd Faction, not to be foild without hopes, will have recourse to the violence of the Mob, in expectation of provoking the Ministry to commit some Imprudence: Their greatest Imprudence woud be remissness on that Occasion. Open Violence gives such a palpable Reason for the severe Execution of the Laws, a thing much wanted, that it ought immediately to be laid hold of, and it will have a very salutary Effect.

The part which Chatham acts, after all the Favours and Distinctions which he has receivd from the Crown, is infamous, like himself.

I send you enclos'd an answer to one of Cadells. It is open, that you may read it, as the matter concerns you, no less than him.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.
