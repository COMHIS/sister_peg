Dear Smith

I send you the enclosd with a large Packet for Count Sarsfield. This is the last ministerial Act, which I shall probably perform; and with this Exertion I finish my Functions. I shall not leave this Country presently: Perhaps I may go over to France. Our Ressignation is a very extraordinary Incident; and will probably occasion a total Change of Ministry. Are you busy? Yours

David Hume.

London 14 of July 1767

You must keep Count Sarsfield's Papers till a proper Method of returning them be pointed out to you. Have you read Lord Lyttleton? Do you not admire his Whiggery and his Piety; Qualities so useful both for this World & the next?
