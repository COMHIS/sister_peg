London, 2nd May 1767.

Dear Sir:

Since I wrote to you I had a visit from Mr. Bradshaw, first clerk of the treasury, who informed me of farther particulars concerning M. Rousseau's pension; it commences from the 5th of April last, and the first quarter of it will be paid, without deductions, on or about the fifth of July next. He need only give an order to a banker, or any other person he pleases, to receive it; and this person must address himself to Mr. Lowndes, the secretary of the treasury, and show him M. Rousseau's letter. This is all the formality requisite. I hope he will enjoy this mark of His Majesty's bounty with tranquillity and peace of mind.

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant,

David Hume
