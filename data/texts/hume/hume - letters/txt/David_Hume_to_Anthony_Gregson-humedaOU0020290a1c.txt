Edinburgh St Andrews Square 
 5 of May 1774



Sir

I believe all the Payments which your Brother made to mine were at a time when I was abroad, and had left a Factory or Powers of Attorney with my Brother to receive Payment of all my Rents and Interest: But as these Powers have expir'd on my settling here, I believe it will be necessary for you to find a way of remitting the Money to this Place, which, I hope, it will not be difficult for you to do. As you seem to think it indifferent for your Nephew's Interest, whether the Money be pay'd once a Year or in the two Years, I shall consider it as an Obligation, if it be pay'd once a Year. I am

 Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
