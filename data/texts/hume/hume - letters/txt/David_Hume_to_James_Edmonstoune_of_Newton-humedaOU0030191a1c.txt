Caro Giuseppe, or Guidelianus, or Newton, or whatever Titles please thine Ear: For I think you are known by as many Aliases, as Turpin or any Hero the most renown'd in Story. I am sorry to tell you, that your Nymph, whom I have not seen for many Years, has, by all accounts, degenerated very much from the primitive Innocence, in which you found her, and, I hope, left her: She has indeed, I believe, become a common Prostitute: Her Sister, who was my Servant, has likewise fallen into very bad habits, and comes very seldom near this house: And unluckily your Direction was so obliterated by some Accident, that I coud not read it, nor find out the Object of your Charity: I commend your Humanity; though perhaps, it is misplac'd on the present Occasion. Not but dissolute People are a proper Object of Compassion; but no Assistance or Relief does them any Service. However, I keep your Guinea, till I shall see her Sister, who comes here sometimes, and whom I shall desire to send your former Maid to profit by your Generosity: At least, I keep it, till I shall see you. But why is that so seldom? Why do you never come to Town? What are you employ'd about, farming, reading, procreating, or nothing at all? I am very sorry to hear you mention your bad State of Health: Were I not occupyd very much in building, I shoud have attended Baron Mure, and rejoicd at your Fire Side. My Compliments to Mrs Edmondestone; and believe me to be with great Sincerity.

 Your affectionate humble Servant

David Hume
