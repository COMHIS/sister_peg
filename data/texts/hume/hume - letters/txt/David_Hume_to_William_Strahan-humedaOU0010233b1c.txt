Sir

As we are now drawing towards a Conclusion, I take this Opportunity of returning you Thanks for the Pains you have taken in pointing out such Corrections as occurd to you in this Volume of History. Your Hints have been very judicious, and they have been of great Service to me, as you have seen: For I have commonly follow'd them. I hope to have an Opportunity soon of acknowledging the Favor, & of commencing thence a personal Friendship & Acquaintance. For I have some Thoughts of being in London next Spring, & even of settling there.

I have sent you a List of a few Errata. They are not all of them Errors of the Press; but many of them Negligences & Oversights.

Last Post I desird you to send me no more Sheets, because I was obligd to leave the Town. I must however beg of you to send the corrected Sheets, still directed to this Place: But if there occur any Doubt or Difficulty which may require an immediate Answer, direct to me at Genl St Clair's at Dysert. Please make your Corrector be very attentive in those Sheets, which I am not to revise. I am

 Sir Your most humble Servant,

David Hume.
