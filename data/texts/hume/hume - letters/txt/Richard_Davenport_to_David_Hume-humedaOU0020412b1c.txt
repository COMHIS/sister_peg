I have not since I wrote, seen Rousseau, I fear you form a true Judgment of him, to mention Dreams, Suspicions &c Good God, in one half quarter of a small sheet I could have easily summ'd up all, but fairly own I was asham'd to put em upon paper, if I have the pleasure of Seeing you perhaps you'll hear Some Anecdotes that will (I cant say after what he has wrote) Surprize you, for in troth they are quite of the same stamp. They are some small Altercations which happened between him Madlle & our Women.

Davenport July 19th 1766.
