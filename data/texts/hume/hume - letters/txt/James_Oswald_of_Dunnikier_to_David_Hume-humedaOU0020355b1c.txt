13th June 1765.

Dear Hume,

Your letter of the 2d instant, gave infinite pleasure, by assuring me that Lord Hertford was using the warmest solicitations for your succeeding Bunbury: that circumstance alone is, I think, sufficient to secure success, which, notwithstanding your incredulity, I might almost venture to wish you joy of. The news here, before I received your letter, were, that the ministry intended to make an offer of the Secretaryship to Lord Hertford's son. If that was so, the matter is out of doubt. But if not, his application, in the present circumstances cannot, I should imagine, fail of success. My good wishes, as well as my opinion on this subject, are perfectly well known and understood by everybody. How far any interposition on my part, in any quarter whatever, could be useful to my friend, on the present occasion, you will judge by what you must have heard by this time of our situation in England. I am satisfied, however, that your success is certain, and therefore that I may wish you joy, which I do most sincerely.

Your queries I will take what pains I can to answer, and wish I could do so accurately, but that, I'm afraid, is impossible. It will take some time, and a good deal of inquiry, to do it with any degree of precision in most of your queries; to do it otherwise, would only mislead; and therefore in such cases I shall say so, and assign reasons, which, I hope, will be satisfactory [. . .] .
