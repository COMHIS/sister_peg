Ninewells 1 of Oct. 1766

My dear Oswald,

As your friend Mr Charteris intends to be only a few weeks in Paris, he will be sufficiently occupied in seeing the Palace and gardens and houses and pictures, and other curiosities which are commonly shown to strangers: it would be an absurdity in me to recommend to any French family a young man who proposes to make so short a stay among them; and I have always kept myself carefully from making such a return for the civilities I myself met with. Our friend, Smith, is at present at Paris; and the properest person to put Mr Charteris in a proper way of gratifying his curiosity in those particulars. He will be very fond of an opportunity to oblige you.

I shall probably be in town, that is Edinburgh, next week: I intend to pay you a visit at Kirkaldy. Oh that horrid seasickness! Are there no chairs from the ferry to your house?

 I am, my dear Oswald, 
Yours sincerely,



David Hume.
