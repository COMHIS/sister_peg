[March or April 1751]

Dear Sir

I am sorry your keeping these Papers has proceeded from Business & Avocations, & not from your Endeavours to clear up so difficult an Argument. I despair not, however, of getting some Assistance from you; the Subject is surely of the greatest Importance; and the Views of it so new as to challenge some Attention.

I believe the philosophical Essays contain every thing of Consequence relating to the Understanding, which you woud meet with in the Treatise; & I give you my Advice against reading the latter. By shortening & simplifying the Questions, I really render them much more complete. Addo dum minuo. The philosophical Principles are the same in both: But I was carry'd away by the Heat of Youth & Invention to publish too precipitately. So vast an Undertaking, plan'd before I was one and twenty, & compos'd before twenty five, must necessarily be very defective. I have repented my Haste a hundred, & a hundred times.

I return Strabo, whom I have found very judicious & useful. I give you a great many Thanks for your Trouble.

 I am Dear Sir Yours

Da. Hume.
