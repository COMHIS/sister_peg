Paris 23d of August 1765

Sir

On Tuesday last the 20th Instant, I was honour'd with your Excellency's of the 16th, along with the several Enclosures. I immediatly drew up a Memorial, which I sent to the Duke of Praslin; and I receiv'd for Answer, that he wou'd examine the Contents, and cou'd not confer with me till Tuesday next, the usual day, when foreign Ministers go to Versailles. I shall then transmit to your Excellency the Memorial, and an Account of my Conversation with the French Minister, that both of them may be laid at once before His Majesty.

To morrow I am to have a long Conference with M. de Fontanieu about the Canada Paper; and I do not despair, that that Affair may soon be brought to some satisfactory Conclusion.

In my Dispatch of the 12th Instant, dated from Compiegne, I had the Honour to inform your Excellency of an extraordinary Step taken by the Assembly of the Clergy at Paris. The Account, which I transmitted to your Excellency, was given me by the Venetian Ambassador and confirmd to me by the Dutch Ambassador and by the Envoys of Russia and Portugal, who all transmitted the same Account to their several Courts. But on my Arrival at Paris, I found that the Matter had been considerably exaggerated. These Questions, notwithstanding the Secrecy, endeavourd to be kept, were known to have been agitated in the Assembly of the Clergy, but had not passd: The Authority of the Court had been able to suppress them. I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard, Sir

 Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant

David Hume
