Newington-Green March 24th 1767

Sir,

The kind letter with which you have favour'd me has given me so much pleasure, that I cannot make myself easy without troubling you with this to thank you for it and for your great civility and candour. I was indeed afraid I had taken a liberty you would not approve, but I have very agreeably found the contrary. Should I ever have an opportunity I shall take care to correct the expressions to which I referred in the note I sent you. I am not, I hope, inclin'd to dislike any person merely for a difference in opinion however great, or to connect worth of character and God's favour with any particular set of sentiments. It is one of my most fix'd and favourite principles which I endeavour often to inculcate, that nothing is fundamental besides a faithful desire to find out and to practise truth and right. I am sensible that your time at present must be much taken up, and therefore I will not interrupt you too long. It would give me particular pleasure to see you at Newington-Green, but this is a greater favour than I have any reason to expect. I may probably take the liberty to call upon you, and stand my chance for finding you at home. Before you left London last Autumn I had call'd several times upon you, but always had the mortification of missing you. I am, Sir, with great regard,

Your most obedient and humble servant 
Richd Price
