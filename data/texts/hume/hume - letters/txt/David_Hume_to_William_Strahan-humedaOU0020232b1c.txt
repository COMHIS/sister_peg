Mr Hume's Compliments to Mr Strahan. Wishes him a good New Year: He has receivd the six Copies of his philosophical Pieces, for which he thanks him: They are very elegantly printed, and correctly, thoâ€˜ there are some few unavoidable Errors. He has sent him an Errata, which he desires Mr Strahan to annex if not inconvenient.
