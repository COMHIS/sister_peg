. . . I have translated the p.s. to send it to my friend, the esteem of such a man must be the best balm for his wound'd heart, but I am afraid he will not accept the glorious support you are so good as to offer him. I fear that the weight of his calamities has impair'd his health, and he cannot sustain the fatigues of a long journey. In his last letter to me he expresses a resolution never to see England, on that account, nevertheless I am inform'd since, that new persecutions may possibly determine him to alter his mind, an irregular trial has depriv'd him of the natural rights in his own country, the common-wealth of Berne from the example of Geneva and France has burnt his book and he has been reduced to leave in a hurry an asilum that a friend had proferr'd him there. Such are the grievous misfortunes of this virtuous and unhappy man. I pity, I love him and wish earnestly to sooth the sorrows under wich he labours . . . .

Is it possible, Sir, that this late unhappy event, could deprive of the honour of your presence, a country filled with your fervent admirers, and where everyone will endeavour, to outdo each other, in expressing the veneration and regard you so justly deserve? . . . Besides your case and that of Mr Rousseau tho' both foreigners in France, are quite diferent. . . .

Since I have gone so far, permit me Sir, to ask your opinion upon the last book of Mr Rousseau, I should be very glad to have my judgment of it Confirm'd or mended by yours . . . .
