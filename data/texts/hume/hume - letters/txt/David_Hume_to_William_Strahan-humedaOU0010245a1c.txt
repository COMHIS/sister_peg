Edinburgh 15 Feby. 1757.

Sir

I suppose you have now begun, and are somewhat advanc'd in the Quarto Edition of my Essays. I intend to make an Index to it, and for this Reason have desir'd that the corrected Sheets may be sent me by the Post. I must also desire you to send them from time to time, as they are printed off; that, if there be any Mistakes in the Press (and some are unavoidable) I may be able to make a more full Errata. Please send under a Cover as many as a Frank will admit: And if you want Franks, either Mr Millar or you may send Covers directed to me to Mr Mure, Mr Oswald, Mr Elliot or Sir Harry Erskine. You may chuse either of them whose House lye most convenient. I fancy Mr Mure may have most Leizure.

 I am Sir Your most humble Servt

David Hume.
