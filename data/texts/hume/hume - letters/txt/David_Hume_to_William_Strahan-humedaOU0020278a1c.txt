Edinburgh 20 of March 1773

Dear Sir

I have read twice over all Sir John Dalrymple's new Publication, which contains many curious Papers; but it gives me great Satisfaction to find, that there is not one single Mistake in my History, either great or small, which it gives me occasion to correct.

I could only wish to have an Opportunity of adding one Note in order to correct a mistake into which Sir John is very anxious to lead his Readers, as if the French Intrigues had had a sensible Influence in the Determinations of the English Parliament: And I believe it is not too late even yet to annex it. I remember Mr Millar added a similar Note to the last Octavo Edition drawn from K. James's Memoirs; and it was inserted in more than half the Copies. I have sent you the Note, which I beg may be printed on a Leaf apart, and annexd to all the Copies afterwards disposd of, and even sent to all the Booksellers that have purchasd any considerable Numbers, as well as joined to my own Copies.

I hear you have given Sir John 2000 pounds for the Property of this Volume, which I scarcely believe. The Book is curious, but far from being agreeable Reading; and the Sale will probably be all at first. I again repeat my Entreaties that this Note may be annexd.

 I am Dear Sir Very sincerely yours

David Hume.
