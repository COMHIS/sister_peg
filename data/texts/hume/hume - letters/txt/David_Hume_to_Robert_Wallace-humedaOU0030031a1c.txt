[Edinburgh early 1753]

Sir

You almost frighten me for my Argument; you collect so much Learning & Reasoning. The Passage in Livy, you have cited Yourself in the Dissertation; but I was oblig'd to cite it from my Memory, which is very dangerous. But without reading over the whole Book I coud not recover it. The word ‘expiscate’ which you use Page 170 is Scotch; and I suspect ‘Prestations’ which is us'd in Page 176. I was told by Captain Rutherford, that in New york, they seldom raise black Children in their Cities (which deserve only the Names of Villages) They give them away for nothing to the People in the Country, who raise them.
