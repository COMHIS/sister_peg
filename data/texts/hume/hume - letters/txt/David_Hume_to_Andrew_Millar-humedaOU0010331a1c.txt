Dear Sir

I never saw Mr Vivian & Mr Forster but twice or thrice with our Friend, Ruat, with whom they were engag'd in a Lawsuit: I have never had the Pleasure of seeing Mr Lind: So that really, I have a Scruple of asking so considerable a Favour from Men with whom I am so little acquainted, in behalf of one with whom I am not at all acquainted, & of whose Talents I cannot give them any certain Accounts. For, if I may judge by your Letter, you speak of him only by Hear-Say, and have not much Connexion even with his Uncle. I am afraid these two Gentlemen woud think me somewhat forward in such an Application.

I have been very busy ever since I came down; and if I keep my Health, shall be able to publish Winter after the next, or at farthest in the subsequent Spring: Which I fancy will serve your Purpose well enough. At any Rate, this is not a Matter which I can hurry on, faster than I am able to satisfy myself in the Execution.

I am very much pleas'd with what you tell me, that the Clarendon Papers have fallen into Dr Douglas's Hands especially as Dr Robertson tells me he intends to publish them. What my Sentiments are on the Question you mention, you may learn from my Letter to the Doctor, which I have sent you open, & which I beg you to take the Trouble of sending. For I do not know how to direct it.

I am glad to hear from all Accounts that Mrs Millar is in so good or so tolerable a State of Health: Most of our Friends, I own, say a good State of Health: But we shall make use of whatever Term she pleases; provided she eat & sleep well & maintain her sociable Humour, and only complain a little in the Intervals. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant
