Edinburgh 30 of July 1772

I have hesitated, for some time, between the fear of intruding with my opinion when it was not ask'd, and the Apprehension lest I should be wanting to an intimate Friend on an Occasion where I might possibly be of some small Service to him.  But as the latter Danger appear'd to me the greatest, I have broke thro all the Difficulties, and have ventur'd to give you the present Trouble, which I hope your Indulgence will excuse. I have heard that my Friend, Mr Ferguson, has been recommended to you as the most proper Person to be appointed Secretary to the Commission of Supervisors for the East Indies; and that, from his general good Character, you were much inclin'd to favour him.

I have liv'd in the greatest Intimacy with Mr Ferguson for above twenty years; and tho' I admir'd very much the Beauty of his Genius, known to all the World from his Writings; I assure you, that his Probity, Integrity, and Greatness of Mind, which are also known to everybody in this Country, have always been the chief Foundation of the Esteem which I bore him. I do not more than repeat to you the general Voice, not only of all his Acquaintance but of the Public; and I have the Satisfaction to find that my great affection to him has not render'd me partial in this particular. As far, therefore, as my Testimony can have any Weight with you, or as far as the public Opinion, which in these Matters ought to have great Weight with every body, I may venture to say, that Mr Ferguson will be recommended as the Person the most proper for this Trust, that cou'd possibly have been pitch'd on.

I am with great Regard Dear Sir your most obedient & most humble Servant 
David Hume
