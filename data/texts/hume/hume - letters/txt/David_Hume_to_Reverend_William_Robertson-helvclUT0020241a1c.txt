London, 12 March 1759

My dear Sir

I believe I mentioned to you a French gentleman, Monsieur Helvétius, whose book, De l'Esprit, was making a great noise in Europe. He is a very fine genius and has the character of a very worthy man. My name is mentioned several times in his work with marks of esteem, and he has made me an offer, if I would translate his work into English, to translate anew all my philosophical writing into French. He says that none of them are well done, except that on the Natural History of Religion, by Monsieur Matigny, a Counsellor of State. He added that the Abbé Prévost, celebrated for the Mémoires d'un homme d'honneur and other entertaining books, was just now translating my History. This account of Helvétius engaged me to send him over the new editions of all my writings, and I have added your History, which, I told him, was here published with great applause, adding that the subject was interesting and the execution masterly, and that it was probable some man of letters at Paris may think that a translation of it would be agreeable to the public. . . .

I have got a good reason or pretence for excusing me to Monsieur Helvétius with regard to the translating his work. A translation of it was previously advertised here.
