[? December 1754]

Dear Sir,

With great pleasure I have more than once perused your tragedy. It is interesting, affecting, pathetic. The story is simple and natural; but what chiefly delights me, is to find the language so pure, correct, and moderate. For God's sake, read Shakespeare, but get Racine and Sophocles by heart. It is reserved to you, and you alone, to redeem our stage from the reproach of barbarism.

I have not forgot your request to find fault, but as you had neither numbered the pages nor the lines in your copy, I cannot point out particular expressions. I have marked the margin, and shall tell you my opinion when I shall have the pleasure of seeing you. The more considerable objections seem to be these: Glenalvon's character is too abandoned. Such a man is scarce in nature; at least, it is inartificial in a poet to suppose such a one, as if he could not conduct his fable by the ordinary passions, infirmities, and vices of human nature. Lord Barnet's character is not enough decided; he hovers betwixt vice and virtue, which, though it be not unnatural, is not sufficiently theatrical nor tragic. After Anna had lived 18 years with Lady Barnet, and yet had been kept out of the secret, there seems to be no sufficient reason why, at that very time, she should have been let into it. The spectator is apt to suspect that it was in order to instruct him; a very good end indeed, but which might have been attained by a careful and artificial conduct of the dialogue.

There seem to be too many casual rencounters. Young Forman, passing by chance, saves Lord Barnet; Old Forman, passing that way by chance, is arrested. Why might not Young Forman be supposed to be coming to the Castle, in order to serve under Lord Barnet, and Old Forman, having had some hint of his intention, to have followed him that way? [. . . .] Might not Anna be supposed to have returned to her mistress after long absence? This might account for a greater flow of confidence.
