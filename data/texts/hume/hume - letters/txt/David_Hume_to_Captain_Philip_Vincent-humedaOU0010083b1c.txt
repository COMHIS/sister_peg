Sir,

I receiv'd your letter from my Lord, who says that you have all along utterly mistaken his meaning, and that he desires not I shou'd leave him, and other circumstances remain as before. On the contrary, he is so polite as to tell me, that my company is not disagreeable to him, and that, provided other circumstances be rang'd according to his desire, he shou'd be very willing I shou'd stay with him, or near him, and have the honour of seeing him frequently. Much less does he desire, that I shou'd leave him, and another be sought in my place; since it is your declar'd intention, by what you wrote us both, some time ago, that he shou'd not be without a friend or companion. He says, besides, that there was not a word of my name in the message he sent you, and from which you have taken occasion to write me this letter. I know not how to act amidst all these contrarieties and irresolutions. I am, &c.

P.S. I have shown this letter to my Lord, who says it is quite conformable to his intentions.
