. . . General Conway told me on my Arrival, that Rousseau had made an Application to him, thro' the Canal of Mr Davenport, to have his Pension granted to him. The General's Answer was, that I was to be in town in a few days; and without my Consent and even full Approbation he woud take no Step in that Affair. You may believe, that I exhorted him to do so charitable an Action. I wish he may not find a Difficulty with the King, who is very much prejudicd against Rousseau. This Step of my old Friend confirms the Suspicion which I always entertain'd, that he thought he had Interest enough to obtain the Pension of himself, and that he had only pick'd a Quarrel with me in order to free himself from the humiliating Burthen of Gratitude towards me. His Motives, therefore, were much blacker than many seem to apprehend them.

A Gentleman told me, that he heard from the French Ambassador, that His Most Christian Majesty had given an Arret prohibiting under the severest Penalties the printing, vending or dispersing any Paper of Rousseau or his Partizans against me. I dine with the Ambassador to day; so shall know the Truth of the Matter, which scarce appears credible. It is surely very honourable for me; but yet will occasion that strange Man to complain, that he is oppressd with Power all over the World. I am Dear Dr Yours sincerely
