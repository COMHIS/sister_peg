[. . .] Lord Marischal wrote me lately, that the celebrated Rousseau had taken Shelter with him at Neufchatel; but that he had thoughts of coming to England, and desird to know of me, if he could make an Edition of his Works by which he could gain a little Money for his Subsistance, as he was not interested: He wishd also, that I could recommend him to a Bookseller. You have told me, that you do not care to deal in French Books; but if he should publish any new Work, might he not have a Translation of it ready to be publishd at the same time with the Original? And would not you be willing to deal with him in that Shape? I should think him very fortunate, if he were in your hands. [. . .]

I am Dear Sir

Yours sincerely 
David Hume
