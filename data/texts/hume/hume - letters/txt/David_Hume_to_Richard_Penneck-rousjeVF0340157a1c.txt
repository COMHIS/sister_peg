Sir, I doubt not, but you remember, that when I had the Pleasure of meeting you at Wickham about two months ago, I mentioned to you the Affair of Mr. Rousseau's Letters to me, the Originals of which I had sent to Mr. Maty, to be preserved in the Museum. As the curators did not think proper to give them place, I wish'd to recover Possession of them, and Mr. Maty promised to send them to me; But he always neglected it. I should be much oblig'd to you, if you would put him in mind of it.

I am, Sir,

Your most obedient and most humble Servant 
David Hume



Secretary of State's Office, St. James's, 29 of Oct. 1767.

P.S. I should be glad to know whether Dr. Maty ever propos'd the affair to the Curators.
