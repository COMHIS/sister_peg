[London 24 February, 1767]

Dear Ferguson

I happen'd yesterday to visit a Person three hours after a Copy of your Performance was open'd for the first time in London. It was by Lord Mansfield. I accept the Omen of its future Success. He was extremely pleas'd with it; said it was perfectly well wrote; assurd me, that he woud not stop a moment till he had finishd it, and recommended it strongly to the Perusal of the Archbishop of Yorke, who was present.

Tho' I set out with Reluctance I do not regreat my Journey. Direct to me at Miss Elliots in Brewer's Street. I have not seen Smith: judge of my Hurry.

 Yours sincerely

David Hume
