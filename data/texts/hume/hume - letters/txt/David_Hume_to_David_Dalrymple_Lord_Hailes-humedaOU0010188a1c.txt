Sir,

There is a Book, calld Flagellum or the Life of Oliver Cromwell, which I have commission'd for the Library; but as it is a very scarce Book, & these Commissions are not soon answer'd, I may wait long before I get it. I know you have a very large Library; & if that Book be in it, I shall be very much obligd to you for a Loan of it; that being now the Period, which I have begun upon. I am

 Sir Your most obedient Servant

If ever you read the Works of Julian, the Apostate (which, I own, notwithstanding that circumstance in his Favor, are not much worth the Reading) you will see that Julian acknowledges the great Charity of the Christians, which they extended, he says, even sometimes to Heathens: But he asserts, like a Rogue as he is, that they borrow'd that Virtue from the Writings of Homer & other heathen Poets. But whenceever they borrowd it, it was certainly a very commendable Quality, & well worth the imitating.
