Brewers-street 3d of Aug. 1769.

Sir, The person about whom you desire information came to me near a year and a half ago, with his wife and daughter. They were recommended to me by the celebrated Mons. Diderot, who told me that Mad. Neuville was a relation of his wife; and he recommended her in the strongest terms; but spoke well also of the husband. Upon so good an authority I placed her in Sir George Colebroke's family as Gouvernante to his daughter, where she behaved very well during a twelvemonth, and then returned to her own country. I think I wrote you that it was entirely upon M. Diderot's recommendation I interested myself in them; for they were totally unknown to me. About a month ago I received a letter from the husband, desiring the loan of ten guineas, in addition to ten with which I had furnished them on their first arrival. But as I did not think proper to comply, I heard nothing more of him. If he has done any thing scandalous I think you ought to inform M. Diderot, that that honest man may no longer be imposed on by people unworthy of his protection. M. Diderot lives in the Rue Taranne, at Paris. As to Neuville, he is so miserably poor that his creditors can expect no payment, and you will never probably see him more.

 I am, Sir, . . . &c.

David Hume.
