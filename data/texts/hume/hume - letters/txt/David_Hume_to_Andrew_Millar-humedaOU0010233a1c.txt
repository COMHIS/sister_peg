Mr Strahan in a few days will have finish'd the Printing this Volume; and I hope you will find Leizure, before the Hurry of Winter, to peruse it, & to write me your Remarks on it. I fancy you will publish about the middle of November. I must desire you to take the Trouble of distributing a few Copies to my Friends in London, & of sending me a few Copies here. The whole will be 15 Copies.

Notwithstanding Mr Mallets Impertinence in not answering my Letter (for it deserves no better a Name) if you can engage him from yourself to mark on the Perusal such Slips of Language, as he thinks I have fallen into in this Volume, it will be a great Obligation to me: I mean that I shall lie under an Obligation to you: For I woud not willingly owe any to him. I am Dr Sir

 Your most humble Servant

David Hume
