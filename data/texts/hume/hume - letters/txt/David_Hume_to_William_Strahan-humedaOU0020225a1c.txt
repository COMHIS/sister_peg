Edinburgh 5 June 1770

Dear Sir

Even according to Mr Cadel's present account, which I have not the least Reason to give any Credit to, you have copies enow to serve you for many Years' Sale; and I give over all thoughts of any new Edition. Only, if such a thing shoud happen, I think it proper to inform you, that I have a Copy by me, corrected in many places, especially in the four first Volumes. This shall be sent you on demand either by myself, if alive, or by my Brother or Heirs; and I wish that no Edition be made without following it. I shall never make any more Enquiries about the Matter: I did not even make any Enquiries at this time; but receiving from Mr Cadel some inconsistent Accounts, which he had sent me voluntarily of himself, I took Occasion to mention them to you. As he finds his Credit runs very low with me in that particular (tho' I believe him a very honest man) he may spare himself the trouble of saying any thing farther concerning it. I wish Millar had savd the Expence of this Magnificent Quarto Edition, which can serve to no purpose but to discredit the Octavo; and make the sale, if possible, still more slow.

There is a notable Error of the Press in this last Quarto of my Essays, which confounds and perplexes the Sense; and being so easily corrected, I wish you woud give orders for that purpose. It is Vol. 2. p. 395. l. 1. for useful read usual. A boy with his pen in half an hour coud go thro all the Copies. It is the very first Line of the third Appendix. I beg of you not to forget this Request. I have writ to Cadel to the same purpose. It is in the second page of Sheet E.e.e.

I have seen Lady Grant. I am told, that she and Sir Archibald hold as much amorous play and dalliance, as ever Adam and Eve did in Paradise; and they make every body in love with the marryd State. It will be a curious Experiment whether his sly Flattery or her tenacious Avarice will get the better: I conjecture, that the contest is begun already. I took occasion to mention to her Sir Archibald's extensive and noble Plantations; but she told me, that she thought that Planting was his Folly, and that people ought to take care, lest their concern for Posterity shoud hurt themselves. Thus she will check the poor man in the only laudable thing he has ever done.

I wish you woud be so good as to send me an account of the Debt I owe you, which, tho' it be but a trifle, I coud wish to pay.

The Madness and Wickedness of the English (for do not say, the Scum of London) appear astonishing, even after all the Experience we have had. It must end fatally either to the King or Constitution or to both.

You say nothing to me of the new Edition of my Essays in 12Â°, and of my desire to have six copies of it whenever it is finishd. Perhaps you have stopd short in that work, and I think you much in the right in so doing.

 I am Dear Strahan Yours sincerely

David Hume.
