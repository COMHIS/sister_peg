Saturday Forenoon [Jan. or Feb. 1765].

Since I saw you last, I am become less apprehensive of your weakness than of your force. I see your health re-establishes itself every day, and hope it continues to do so. But I dread the vigour and vehemence of your resolutions. Remember your promise, that you are to embrance no new measure without at least informing me. I interest myself so much in your fortune, that you cannot think yourself fully entitled to dispose of what concerns me so intimately, altogether unknown to me. I must ingenously confess to you, that, the more I hear and reflect, the more I am inclined to justify your expectations and to give credit to your hopes. I have read a great part of Les Letters de la Montagne. The book in my humble opinion will not do credit to M. Rousseau, though it might to another. I disapprove particularly of the seditious purpose of the last letters, which have succeeded but too well at Geneva: for the magistrates of that city, which the author had formerly celebrated with reason as one of the best governed in the world, are in mortal fear every hour of being massacred by the populace. There is the character of a lady, which many people have applied to you: but though the picture be like, I do not believe it was meant for you. If the book were not extremely scarce, I would endeavour to procure you a copy.

 If you foresee at any time, that you are likely to be alone at Staure, I should certainly, if possible, wait on you, notwithstanding my resolution not to see you, till you should come nearer to us.
