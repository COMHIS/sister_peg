Dear Sir Gilbert

Lord North has refusd the Office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, tho‘ it was earnestly press'd upon him, and tho‘ he professes an entire Satisfaction with every Person in the Administration. He dreads the Labour of the Office, especially as it obliges him to take so great a part in the Business of the House of Commons. It will not probably be offer'd to any Scotsman, for Fear of popular Reflections concerning the Influence of the Thane. The same Objection, as well as others, lie against Dyson, who has been thought of. I see the Ministry in some Perplexity: Perhaps this Incident may draw on new Resignations and Negotiations and Cabals. I think one Defect of the present Situation of our Government is, that nobody desires much to have any Share in the Administration, except Adventurers, of whom the Public is naturally distrustful. The pecuniary Emoluments are of no Consideration to Men of Rank & Fortune: You have often more personal Regard from being in the Opposition: The Protection of the Law is at all times sufficient for your Security: And by acquiring Authority, you are expos'd to Insults, instead of gaining the Power to revenge them. Why then shoud a Man of Birth, Fortune, and Parts, sacrifice his Fame and Peace to an ungrateful Public? Such is the Defect that arises from the Perfection of the most perfect Government.
