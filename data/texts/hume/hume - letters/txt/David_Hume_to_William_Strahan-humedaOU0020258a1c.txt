Dear Sir

The Sheet you mention I deliverd with my own Hands on Friday the 31 of Jany to John Balfour, who promis'd to send it with his own Letters to the Post house. It is by his unpardonable Negligence it is lost. I shall rate him about it; but if you do not receive it this post or the next, you will be so good as [to] send me another copy which I shall not entrust to him in returning it.

 I am Dear Sir Yours most faithfully

D. H.

 Feby 11, 1772.

P.S.

I am very well pleas'd that the Sheet is found; and also, that I did not know it, till I had writ a very scolding Letter to John Balfour for his losing it.
