Edinburgh 20 of April 1776

Dear Strahan

My Body sets out to-morrow by Post for London; but whether it will arrive there is somewhat uncertain. I shall travel by slow Journies. Last Monday, I sent off by the Waggon, directed to Mr Cadel, the four last Volumes of my History. I bring up my philosophical Pieces corrected, which will be safe, whether I dye by the Road or not.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.
