Dear Sir

On Saturday I went over to Wootton, & gave your letter into Mr. Rousseaus hands; he has been a deal out of order lately in his health, & I found him but very poorly, tis his old complaint which has return'd upon him with great Violence. He looks much worse than when I saw him last, nor has he at all his usual spirits.

I shall take your introducing me to Dr. Armstrong as a great Favour. If you chuse the road by Northampton tis just the Same as to nearness as by Coventry & quite good. Northampton, Lecester, Derby, Ashbourn, Leek, from which town my house is distant 14 miles in as direct a road as you can go to Edinburgh. The other way, Coventry, Litchfield, Stone, Newcastle, at Brereton Green, my house one mile to the right hand.

I am Dear Sir

Your Most oblidged 
Humble Sert
