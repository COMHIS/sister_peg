My Dear David

You mistake the Matter entirely; the Duchess's Proposal was not that we should come to Inverary immediately for she mentioned her Daughter Lady Betty being to be down next Month, as an inducement to us. Mrs. Mure in Answer told her Grace, that we had concerted the whole Matter before we received her obliging Invitation; that you had gone a jaunt into the North of England, were to return the west Road, and be here; and that then, in about two Weeks hence, we were to set out together to wait on her, and the Duke. Now why alter that Plan? Why dont you proceed in your English Expedition, and let me keep my Word to Lady Betty Stanley, when I saw her at London, of not going to Inveraray till she came? I would really have you still to pay your Visit to John Bull, youll be the better for it. Make it as short as you please, and when you come here, stay the longer. You shall get any Bed you please on the Floor you like. Write me your Notions. Yours while Will Mure.
