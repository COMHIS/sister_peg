Dear Madam

I must beg of you not to lend the book out of your house on any account till the middle of November. Anybody may read it in the house.

As I send you a long book you will allow me to write a short letter. I send the Fruit of near two Years very constant application: my youngest and dearest Child. You should have received it sooner; but during the fine Weather I forsaw, that it woud produce some inconvenience: Either you woud attach yourself so much to the perusal of me, as to neglect walking, riding & field diversions, which are much more beneficial than any history: Or if this beautifull season tempted you, I must lye in a corner, neglected & forgotten. I assure you I woud take the Pet, if so treated. Now that the weather has at last broke, and long nights are joind to wind and rain, and that a Fireside has become the most agreable object, a new book, especially if wrote by a Friend, may not be unwellcome. In expectation then that you are to peruse me first with Pleasure, then with care; I expect to have your remarks, & Mr Dysarts & the Sollicitors. Whether am I Whig or Tory? Protestant or Papist? Scotch or English? I hope you do not all agree on this head; & that there [are] disputes among you about my principles. We never see you in town; and I never can get to the Country. But I hope I preserve a place in your Memory.

I am Dear Madam Your affectionate Friend and Servant

I have seen John Humes new unbaptized Play; and it is a very fine thing. He now discovers a great Genius for the Theatre.
