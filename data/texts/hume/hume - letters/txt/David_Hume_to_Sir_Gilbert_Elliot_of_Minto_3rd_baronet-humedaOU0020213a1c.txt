Dear Sir Gilbert

I do not know whether you be good for any thing, or at all worth the applying to: I rather suspect, not: But in case you are, I make you the following Application in favour of Christopher Tate, Probationer, who was Tutor to my Nephews. The enclos'd Note gives an Account of the Parish. You know, I resignd my Pretensions on the Presentation of Humbie to your Nephew's Tutor; but under Promise, that you woud assist me in a like Case. This Kirk is a King's Presentation: It is within your County; and I very earnestly desire Success in this Application, and trust much to your Friendship in it.

The last unexpected Incident strikes us mute with Astonishment. Either the Duke of Grafton is much to blame for leaving us so abruptly, in so very critical a time, or a greater than he, if he got any just Cause for it. I carry my View to very dismal Consequences, especially as I suspect the last to be the Case. I fancy we shall have curious Scenes coming, worthy the Pen of the greatest Historian. I am tird and disgusted with Conjecture. My Compliments to Lady Elliot. Believe me to be very sincerely Dear Sir Gilbert

 Your affectionate humble Servant

David Hume
