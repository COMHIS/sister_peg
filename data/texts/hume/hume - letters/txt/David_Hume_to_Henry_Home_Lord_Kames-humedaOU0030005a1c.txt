Ninewells  June. 4. 1739

Dear Sir

You see I am better than my Word, having sent you two Papers instead of one. I have Hints for two or three more, which I shall execute at my Leizure. I am not much in the Humour of such Compositions at present, having receiv'd News from London of the Success of my Philosophy, which is but indifferent, if I may judge by the Sale of the Books, & if I may believe my Bookseller. I am now out of Humour with myself; but doubt not in a little time to be only out of Humour with the World, like other unsuccessful Authors. After all, I am sensible of my Folly in entertaining any Discontent, much more Despair upon this Account; since I cou'd not expect any better from such abstract Reasoning, nor indeed did I promise myself much better. My Fondness for what I imagin'd new Discoveries made me overlook all common Rules of Prudence; & having enjoy'd the usual Satisfaction of Projectors, tis but just I shou'd meet with their Dissappointments. However, as tis observ'd that with such sort of People, one Project generally succeeds another, I doubt not but in a day or two I shall be as easy as ever, in Hopes that Truth will prevail at last over the Indifference & Opposition of the World. You see I might at present subscribe myself Your most humble Servant, with great Propriety: but notwithstanding shall presume to call myself

 Your most affectionate Friend as well as humble Servant

David Hume

This comes by the Foulden Carrier, who will bring me those Papers of your Friends, if you think proper to send them. He lodges in Deacon Hart's at the Head of the Cannon gate
