Dear Sir,

After all my enquiries I cant for the life of me find out to what part my wild Philosopher is fled. I sent after him some papers thinking they would most certainly find him in London. No such matter, he's not to be found there. They scarce took any thing along with [th]em, but what they carried on their backs. All the Trunks &c. are at Wootton & this odd man has just pack'd up his things, & left the keys dangling at the locks of his boxes. No sort of direction for me tho' he knows I am in his debdt between £30 & 40 & I want of all things to inform him what he has to do in relation to his Majestys bounty — which I am sure he will with great satisfaction receive, because I have it so positively under his own hand.

You shall have the joy of perusing his letter, but one dated about Six days before must be added to it.

At present my Gout's too much upon me to write coppies of [th]em.

Pray if you hear where he is do me the pleasure to inform me.

 I am Dear Sir Your Most Obedient and most Humble Servant

Rich. Davenport

P.S. I protest I pity him more & more, as I certainly conclude that his head is not quite right.
