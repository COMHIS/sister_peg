Dear Sir

I return many thanks for the favour of yours. Have not as yet seen Mr Rousseau & God knows when I shall unless he comes over to me, for the first of this month, I was seiz'd with the Gout, & at present am confined to my room. How long I shall be a prisoner I cant even guess, for my fits sometimes continue 2 or 3 months. If Lord Holderness pleases to send any person over he will be sure to find me, & I shall with the greatest pleasure give him all the information & instruction I possibly Can. I purpose sending over to Rousseau tomorrow, & shall give him an invitation to come here, for I long to hear from himself where He purposes going this summer, as he wrote to me a good while ago, that he wanted to have advice for Madselle Vaisseur, whose [health] he told me began visibly to decline.

I hope Lord Holderness Ground is not stoney.

I am Dear Sir

Your Most Oblidged 
Humble Servant 
Rich. Davenport
