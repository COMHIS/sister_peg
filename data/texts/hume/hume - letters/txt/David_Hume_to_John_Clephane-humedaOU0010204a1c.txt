Oct. 18th 1754.

Dear Doctor,

I received your kind letter, for which I thank you. Poor Aber is disappointed by a train of Norland finesse, alas — what you will. I have given orders to deliver to you a copy of my History, as soon as it arrives in London, and before it be published. Lend it not till it be published. It contains no paradoxes, and very little profaneness, — as little as could be expected. The Abbé Le Blanc, who has translated some other of my pieces, intends to translate it, and the enclosed is part of a copy I send him: excuse the freedom — you may perhaps receive some other packets of the same kind, which you will please to send carefully to the post-house. The General and Sir Harry are in town, who remember you. Edmonstone is well, and I just now left him abed. I may perhaps be in London for good and all in a year or two. Show me that frugality could make £120 a year do, and I am with you: a man of letters ought always to live in a capital, says Bayle. I believe I have no more to say. You'll own that my style has not become more verbose, on account of my writing quartos.

 Yours affectionately,

David Hume.
