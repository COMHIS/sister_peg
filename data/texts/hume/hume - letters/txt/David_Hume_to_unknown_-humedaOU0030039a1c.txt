Sir

I hope this will come to your hand, along with a Copy of my four Dissertations, which I hope you will honor with a Place in your Library. I have desir'd my Friend to deliver the Book, according to your Directions, into Lord Holderness's Office, or whoever shoud have the Department of the North at the time: For our Ministers change so quick, that we know not who is to be in Office next Post.

In order to make this triffling Present more worthy your Acceptance, I have sent with it a very elegant Performance of a Friend of mine, the Gentleman to whom I had address'd my Dissertations. His Play had been rejected by the Manager of the London Theatre, the best Actor, but the worst Critic in the World; so that it was oblig'd to be brought on at Edinburgh. I thought it proper for me to support my Friend under these Discouragements by all means in my Power; and accordingly, address'd to him this Dedication; the only one I ever wrote, or probably shall ever write, during the Course of my Life. I had the Satisfaction to think it did him some Service. The Tragedy was afterwards brought on at London, and acted with great Applause of the best Judges. You will find it, I hope, very pathetic, elegant, natural; entirely in the Taste of the Greek Tragedy, & very wide of the Fustian & Rant, which have so much prevail'd on our Theatre. I have the Honor to be

 Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant

David Hume.
