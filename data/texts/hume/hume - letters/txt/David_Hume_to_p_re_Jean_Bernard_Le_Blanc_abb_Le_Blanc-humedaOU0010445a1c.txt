Sir

I delayd sending you the Books which I receivd a few days ago, intending every day to call upon you and to endeavour making myself Amends for my Misfortune in meeting with you so seldom. I shall lay hold of every Opportunity with Pleasure that may bring us together, and particularly shall give you warning the first day I go to Chatillon, that I may have the Honour of conveying you thither. The Price of Edwards is stated to me at six Guineas with seven Shillings for Box, Package, Freight & Carriage from London. I think it dear, but it seems to be well ornamented. I am

 Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
