Dear Sir

I must beg you to take the Trouble of sending the enclos'd to your Guest, after having read it. It is the last Trouble of the kind, which I shall ever give you; so I hope for your Excuse. As he will receive no Letters by the Post, this is the only Method by which I cou'd reach him; and I am besides well pleas'd that you shoud be well acquainted with every Step of my Behaviour, in hopes of you Approbation. This Man's Conduct is such a Composition of Wickedness and Frenzy, that one does not know whether they are to be angry at him for the one or to pity him for the other. I flatter myself, that you will think my Letter sufficiently temperate and decent.

I propose soon to be at your Fire-side or rather in your shady Grove: For I think the Weather more suitable to the latter than the former. You will allow me to bring my Friend along with me: It is Dr Armstrong, Author of the Art of preserving Health, and of many other fine Pieces: He is besides a very worthy Man. I shall use the Freedom to inform you some time before we set out. I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient & most humble Servant
