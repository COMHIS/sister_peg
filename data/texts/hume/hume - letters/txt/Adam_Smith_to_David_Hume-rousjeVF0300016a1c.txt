My dear friend

I am thoroughly convinced that Rousseau is as great a Rascal as you, & as every man here believes him to be; yet let me beg of you not to think of publishing any thing to the world upon the very great impertinence which he has been guilty of to you. By refusing the Pension which you had the goodness to sollicit for him with his own consent, he may have thrown, by the baseness of his Proceeding, some little ridicule upon you in the eyes of the Court & the ministry. Stand this ridicule, expose his brutal letter, but without giving it out of your own hand so that it may never be printed, & if you can, laugh at yourself, & I shall pawn my life that before three weeks are at an end, this little affair, which at present gives you so much uneasiness, shall be understood to do you as much honor as any thing that has ever happened to you. By endeavouring to unmask before the Public this hypocritical Pedant, you run the risk, of disturbing the tranquillity of your whole life. By letting him alone he cannot give you a fortnights uneasiness. To write against him, is, you may depend upon it, the very thing he wishes you to do. He is in danger of falling into obscurity in England & he hopes to make himself considerable by provoking an illustrious adversary. He will have a great party. The church, the Whigs, the Jacobites, the whole wise English nation, who will love to mortify a Scotchman, & to applaud a man who has refused a Pension from the King. It is not unlikely too that they may pay him very well for having refused it, & that even he may have had in view this compensation. Your whole friends here wish you not to write, the Baron, D'Alembert, Madame Riccaboni, Mademoiselle Riancourt, Mr Turgot &c, &c. Mr Turgot, a friend every way worthy of you, desired me to recommend this advice to you in a Particular manner, as his most earnest entreaty & opinion. He & I are both afraid that you are surrounded with evil counsellors, & that the Advice of your English literati, who are themselves accustomed to publish all their little gossping stories in Newspapers, may have too much influence upon you. Remember me to Mr Walpole & believe me to be with the most sincere affection ever yours

 Make my apology to Miller for not having yet answered his last very kind letter. I am preparing the Answer to it which he will certainly receive by next post. Remember me to Mrs Millar. Do you ever see Mr Townshend.
