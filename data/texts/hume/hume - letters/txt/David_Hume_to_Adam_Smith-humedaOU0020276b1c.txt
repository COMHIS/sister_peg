St Andrews Square 24 of Feby 
1773



Dear Smith

There are two late Publications here which I advise you to commission. The first is Andrew Stuarts Letters to Lord Mansfield which they say have met with vast Success in London: Andrew has easd his own Mind, and no bad Effects are to follow: Lord Mansfield is determind absolutely to neglect them. The other is Lord Monboddo's Treatise on the Origin and Progress of Language, which is only part of a larger work. It contains all the Absurdity and malignity which I expected; but is writ with more Ingenuity and in a better Stile than I look'd for.

 Surge et inhumanæ senium depone Camenæ. Yours

D. H.

P.S.

I shoud save you Expence, by sending you over both these works, if I knew how.
