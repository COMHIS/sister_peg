Hotel de Brancas 30 Sept. 1764

I have wrote you a long Letter to London, a short one to Harrowgate, and now I write to you to Minto, not to lose time. You must have a little implicit Faith. Without asking farther Questions give instantly Orders that your Sons be sent to me, and that they come instantly to the Hotel de Brancas. Within less than a Gunshot of this, I have found a Place which has all Advantages beyond what your Imagination coud suggest. It is almost directly opposite to my Friend the Mar√©chale de Mirepoix's, by whose Advice I act. I tell you this, lest your Opinion of my Discretion be not the highest in the World. There are there about thirty Boys of the best Families in France. The House is spacious, airy, clean: Has a Garden: Opens into the Fields. The Board costs only thirteen hundred Livres a Year for each Boy, five hundred for the Tutor: The Boys have almost all Masters for this Sum. I have concluded the Bargain for a Quarter. The Payment runs on from the first of October; because the Course of Studies begins then. There will be no Questions about Religion or the Mass. I have been more particular in my Letter to London. Nothing was ever so fortunate for your Purpose.
