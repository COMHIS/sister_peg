Hotel de Brancas 9 Oct. 1764

I go to Fontainebleau to day: My Lady & Lord Beauchamp go also: Mr Trail, the Chaplain, & Mr Larpent, My Lord's Secretary, follow in a few days: All these Arrangements are unexpected; but the Consequence is, that there will be nobody in the Hotel de Brancas for some Weeks. But this need not retard a Moment your sending the young Gentlemen. I have spoke to the Master of the Academy, who says that the Moment they arrive they shall be settled as well as if all their Kindred were there. I have sent the enclos'd Letter to him, which the Gentleman who attends them may deliver immediatly on his Arrival in Paris. Vive valeque.
