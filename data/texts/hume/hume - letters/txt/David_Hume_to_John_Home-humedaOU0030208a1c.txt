Edinburgh 9 of June 1775

You are so much mistaken; Dear John, in your Conjecture, that Macpherson's Name was never so much as mention'd in Company yesterday. But really, I know not for what reason I may not declare every where my Sentiments of him and all his Productions, except when you are present, since it disobliges you: For I am not likely to meet with any body else, that will care a farthing about the matter. Am I obliged to him for saying in his Preface, that without Vanity, he may say, that the Period which he has chosen has been hither to very imperfectly known? A piece of audacious Effrontery, which characterizes him and his writings above all human Creatures and their productions. For with regard to the two first Reigns, there is not in his paltry work a single Iota of a single Circumstance that is new. And what is new in the other two Reigns, is nothing but the Transcript of Papers, which had been collected by the Care and Industry of another, and which were put into his hands by the Bookseller. O! but, say you, your decrying his History will be thought to proceed from Jealousy and Envy. But, Dear John, I can bring authentic Proof, that I always spoke handsomely of Dr Anderson's History, which is a sublime Production in comparison of Macpherson's: Ergo etc. However, as Macpherson and his History begin to be very little spoke of, and soon will never be spoke of at all, it is not likely I shall ever have occasion to mention them again; and for a very small Inducement cou'd promise you never to mention them. Tho' it is unlucky, that you shou'd make your Peace of Mind depend upon the Opinion of the World with regard to Macpherson.
