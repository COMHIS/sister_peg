[le 23 novembre 1766] 

Dear Sir

I doubt not but you have already got a Copy of that Pamphlet, which with great Reluctance I was obliged to allow my Friends at Paris to publish with regard to this miserable Affair between Rousseau and me; and I cannot doubt of the Judgement you wou'd form of it. Two days ago, I received a Letter of which I send you a Copy enclosed. The References are to the Paris Edition; but the English Translation has the same Passages. The pages 85, 86 of the Paris Edition correspond to 65, 66 of the Translation; and the pages 9(d)–(d)6 to 7(d)–(d)4 of the Translation; I beg of you to transmit the enclos'd to Rousseau. The Reason is, that my Friends imagine, he is mad enough to think of replying and continuing the Controversy: He will see, from this Instance, what weapons I have still in my hand to confound him, if he shoud make such an Attempt, and if I shoud think it worth while to take any farther Notice of it.

I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient humble Servant David Hume
