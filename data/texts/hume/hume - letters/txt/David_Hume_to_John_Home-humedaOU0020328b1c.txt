Edinburgh 9 of July 1776

My Dear John

I offer'd to give you a Letter along with you, informing you how I shoud be on Tuesday thereafter, viz weaker and more infirm than when you saw me: This indeed woud have savd Postage, and I can do no more at present than confirm the same Truth, only that the Matter seems more to proceed with an accelerated Motion. I had yesterday a grand Jury of Physicians who sat upon me, the Doctors Cullen, Black and Home. They all declare the Opinion of the English Physicians, absurd and erroneous. They own a small Tumour in my Liver; but so small and trivial that it coud never do me any material Injury; and they say that I might have liv'd twenty Years with it, and never have felt any Inconvenience from it: Each of them has had Patients who have had Tumours in that part ten times larger without almost complaining for Years together. They have thoroughly perswaded me to be of their Opinion; and according to their united Sentiments, my Distemper is now a HÃ¦morrhage as before, which is an Illness, that I had as Lief dye of as any other. The First Part of the Text being now discuss'd, we proceed to the second viz the Cure, which I leave to another Opportunity. I send you enclosed a Letter, which my Nephew opend by Mistake, but finding, after he had read a few Lines, that it was not meant for him, he proceeded no farther. Yours sincerely

David Hume
