Paris 25th of September 1765

Sir

The Duke of Praslin told me yesterday, that he had already inform'd the Marquess of Blosset, that His Majesty might send over any Person he thought proper to inspect Dunkirk. The Duke said, that the Demolition of the Jettees wou'd be suspended in the mean time: But this, added he, will make no great Difference; as it was otherwise necessary to suspend that Work, in order to judge at leizure of the Effects of the preceding Demolition.

I saw the Dauphin at Versailles and am extremely sorry to find so little Appearance of his Recovery.

The Assembly of the Clergy, on Friday last, voted the free Gift, as requir'd by the King. They will probably be soon dismiss'd; and as they will not meet again for five Years, the present Quarrels, during that time, may be forgot both by them and the Parliament.

I have the Honour of sending enclos'd the Prince of Cond√©'s Answer to His Majesty. I am, with the greatest Regard Sir

 Your Excellency's 
Most obedient & most humble Servant



David Hume

P.S.

I have just now receivd your Excellency's Dispatches of the 20th Instant with the several Enclosures by Mr Violars. I shall immediatly draw up a Memorial to be presented to the Court of France on the Canada Paper.
