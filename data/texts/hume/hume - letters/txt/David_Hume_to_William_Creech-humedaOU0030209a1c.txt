St. Andrews Square 22 of June 1775

Sir,

I wish you woud inform Mr. Elmsley, from whom you had Brotier's Tacitus, that in the first Volume there is wanting Page 273, 274, and Page 275, 276 is twice repeated. I wonder how this mistake has happen'd; but two Copies of that dear and valuable Book are mangled by it. Desire him to look out for Page 273, 274, and offer to send him the other Leaf which I have double. I think that the Book ought not to be pay'd, till this mistake be adjusted, which probably will not be difficult. I am Sir

 Your most humble Servant

David Hume.
