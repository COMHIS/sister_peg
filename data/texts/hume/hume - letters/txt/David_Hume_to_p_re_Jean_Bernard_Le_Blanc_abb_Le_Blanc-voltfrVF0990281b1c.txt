[24 October 1754]

… The Fate of poor Voltaire will terrify all men of Genius from trusting themselves with his Prussian Majesty, who, tho’ one of the most illustrious Characters of the Age, is too much a Rival to be a very constant Patron. We have strange Stories with regard to Voltaire. It is pretended, that that sprightly, agreeable, libertine Wit has at last thrown himself into a Convent, has recanted all his Heresies, and is doing voluntary Pennance for his past Transgressions. But this I have a great Difficulty to believe. It is probably the Invention of the Bigots, in order to throw a Ridicule on him & other Freethinkers. I shou'd be sorry, if this last Accident shoud so crush his Spirits as to disqualify him from any farther Productions, or even damp the Boldness & Freedom of his Reasonings, or more properly speaking, of his Decisions. He has the Art of couching his Determinations in such lively Terms, that they often carry Conviction, as much as if they were supported by the strongest Arguments….
