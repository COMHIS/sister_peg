Sir

As M. Rousseau had wrote to several of his Correspondents abroad, that I never dared to publish the Letters, which he had wrote me; or if I published them, they wou'd be so falsify'd, that they wou'd not be the same, I was obliged to say in my Preface, that the Originals wou'd be consigned in the Mus√¶um: I hope you have no Objection to the receiving them. I send them by my Friend, Mr Ramsay. Be so good as to give them the Corner of any Drawer: I fancy few people will trouble you by desiring a Sight of them: All the World seem to be satisfyed concerning the Foundation of that unhappy Affair: Yet notwithstanding, I own, that I never in my Life took a Step with so much Reluctance as the consenting to that Publication; but as it appeared absolutely necessary to all my Friends at Paris, I cou'd not withstand their united Opinion. I have also sent the Original of Mr Walpole's Letter to me, which enters into the Collection.

 I am Sir 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant
