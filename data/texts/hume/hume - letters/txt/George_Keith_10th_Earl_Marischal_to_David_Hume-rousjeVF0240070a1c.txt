Potsdam 20 february 1765

Sir

. . . I am sorry poor Jean Jaques can not live quiet in his mountain but is attacked by Voltaire, nothing is more just than your comparison of the two combatants; both will receive wounds and hurt without Victory, which will be ascribed (as usuall) to each by their partisans. I have not seen Les Lettres de la Campagne, those de la Montagne are in answer to the first, so J.J. is not the Agressor . . . .
