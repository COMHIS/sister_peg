[1747].

You have never spoke to me of the Essays on British Antiquities; and therefore I should not in decency speak of them to you. But as it would be more indecent to employ a long letter in talking entirely of myself, I shall only say, that I read them with great satisfaction; the reasonings are solid, the conjectures ingenious, and the whole instructive. The style is also very good; correct and nervous, and very pure; only a very few Scotticisms, as conform for conformable, which I remarked. You do me the honour to borrow some principles from a certain book: but I wish they be not esteemed too subtile and abstruse.
