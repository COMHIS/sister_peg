[London July 15, 1766.]

All I can say of Sir David Dalrymple is that he is now a Lord of the Session, and passes by the Name of Lord Hales or Newhales, I know not which. He is a godly Man; feareth the Lord and escheweth Evil, And works out his Salvation with Fear and Trembling. None of the Books Sir David publishes are of his writing: They are all historical Manuscripts, of little or no Consequence. I go to Woburn for three or four days.

I have got a Letter from Rousseau, which would make a good eighteen penny Pamphlet. I fancy he intends to publish it. It is perfect Frenzy; consequently sets my Mind quite at ease.

 Yours

D. H.
