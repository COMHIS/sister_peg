My Dear Sir

I was very sorry to hear by Mr Leechman that you had been ill of late. I am afraid the Fatigues of your Class have exhausted you too much, & that you require more Leizure & Rest than you allow yourself. However, the good Season & the Vacation now approaches; and I hope you intend, both for Exercise & Relaxation, to take a Jaunt to this Place. I have many things to communicate to you. Were you not my Friend, you wou'd envy my robust Constitution. My Application has been & is continual; and yet I preserve entire Health. I am now beginning the Long Parliament; which, considering the great Number of Volumes I peruse, & my scrupulous method of composing, I regard as a very great Advance.

I think you shou'd settle in this Town during the Vacation; where there always is some good Company; and you know, that I can supply you with Books, as much as you please. I beg to hear from you at your Leizure; and am 
Your affectionate Friend & humble Servant
