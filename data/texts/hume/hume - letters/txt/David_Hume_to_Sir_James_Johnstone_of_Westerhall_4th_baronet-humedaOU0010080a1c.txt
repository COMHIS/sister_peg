Sir

I did not leave London till this Morning, & on my Arrival here found Mr Vincent just departing; so that I had not time to write by his Servant. Your Friend is really distrest with a Colic, which the Physician (who was here yesterday) thinks to be a new Turn of his usual Distemper. He is well in other Respects: But I fancy you will choose to delay your Visit till you hear of his perfect Recovery. If I find him quite well next Week, I shall send in the Chaise on Friday without waiting for new Orders; unless you countermand it before. I am

 Sir Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume.

 Saturday.
