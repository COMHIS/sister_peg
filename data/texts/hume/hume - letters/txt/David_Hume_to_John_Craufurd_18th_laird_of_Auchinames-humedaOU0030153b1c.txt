Edinburgh 15 of Novr 1766

I was told, Dear Jack, by Davie Ross, that your Father had taken out an Inhibition against you, by which he declar'd your Obligation to entail your Mother's Estate, and prohibited every one to lend you: This Deed, to have Validity, must be publish'd; which is a very disagreeable Circumstance; and after all, it wou'd have no Validity. The only Effect which I dreaded was that it wou'd disgust you extremely, and perhaps push you to execute some [? counter] Deed, in opposition to such harsh Treatment. If Mr Ross has n[ot written] to you about it, it is surely because he suppos'd you to be alre[ady acquainted] with it. I understood so by his Conversation; other wise it had [? been obnox]ious in me to have wrote you as I did; which I am afraid has given y[ou] a great deal of Uneasyness, and has tortur'd your Imagination to find out my Meaning. I re-iterate, and re-iterate again, all my former sage Councils. Perhaps, after all, your Father has repented, and will not execute his projected Deed.
