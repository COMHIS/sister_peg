Dear Sir

I receiv'd Yours when I was at Compiegne. As soon as I came to Paris, I saw the Count de Broglie and Mlle Robert, who were very well satisfy'd with your Proceedings. They both said, that I shoud be entirely Master of the Terms; but you may easily imagine, that I will not take upon me to determine in an arbitrary manner with regard to other People's Property. My Opinion is, that, as soon as you can come to a Determination both with regard to the Extent of the Property and the Probability of Success, you shou'd offer them at once such a Sum as you think the Object is worth, and leave it at once either to their Acceptance or Refusal.

I beg my Compliments to Mrs Bindley. All this Family are well and join in their Compliments to you. I am Dr Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
