You must know, Mr James Boswall or James Boswell Esq, that I am very much out of Humour with you and your two Companions or Co-partners. How the Devil came it into your Heads or rather your Noddles (for if there had been a Head among you, the thing had not happend; nor are you to imagine, that a Parcel of volatile Spirits, enclos'd in a Skull, make a Head) I repeat it, How the Devil came it into your Noddles to publish in a Book to all the World what you pretend I told you in private Conversation? I say, pretend I told you; for as I have utterly forgot the whole Matter, I am resolv'd utterly to deny it. Are you not sensible, that by this Etourderie, to give it the lightest Name, you were capable of making a Quarrel between me and that irascible little man with whom I live in very good Terms? Do you not feel, from your own Experience, that among us, Gentlemen of the Quill, there is nothing of which we are so jealous, not even our Wives, if we have any, as the Honour of our Productions; and that the least Touch of Blame on that head puts us into the most violent Fury and Combustion? I reply nothing to your Letter till you give me some Satisfaction for this offence; but only assure you that I am not Sir

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant

David Hume
