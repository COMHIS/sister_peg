St Andrews Square 23 of December 1773.

Sir

I wish you woud check your Printer with some Severity for the Freedoms he uses; I suppose to divert himself. He has substituted the Name of Dr MacQueen, whom certainly I did not think of, instead of Dr Robertson, to whose Merit I meant to do some Justice. The last Paragraph which seems to be entirely his own, is also too high a Praise for a new Author like Dr Henry. But, if you want a few Sentences to fill up the Page, I have added them, and beg that you woud take care, that the Printer throw them off faithfully.

I am Sir 
Your most obedient Servant 
David Hume
