Edinburgh 15 of Augt 1776

Dear Davy

You need not doubt but your Company, as well as your Father's, woud have been very agreeable to me, especially at present, for the Consolation of your Company: But I see the immediate Inconvences that attend it: You cannot be well spard from Josey, whose State of Health, I am sorry to find, is still somewhat precarious: And there is no immediate Call for your being here. For besides, that you woud but pass a melancholy time with me; however your Affection might cover it, and relieve it; I am weakening very gradually, and am not threaten'd with any immediate Incident. I shall probably have more warning; in which case I shall not fail to summon you; and I shall never dye in Satisfaction, without embracing you. I doubt not but my Name woud have procured you Friends and Credit, in the Course of your Life, especially if my Brother had allwd you to carry it: For who will know it, in the present Disguise? But as he is totally obstinate on this head, I believe we had better let him alone. I have frequently told him, that it is lucky for him he sees few things in a wrong Light; for where he does he is totally incurable. I am very much at my ease to day.

I beg my Compliments to all your Family. Your affectionate Uncle

David Hume
