London, 13th of March, 1767.

You may probably, dear Madam, have heard of the Disaster that has happened to Lord Tavistoke, and may have heard it represented in more dismal colours than the true; which is the reason that I now take the Liberty to write to you. I know that your Friendship for him wou'd give you the most real Concern, and as there are great Hopes of his Recovery, I was willing to convey them to you. Four Days ago, he fell from his Horse at hunting. He was taken up for Dead; and on Examination was found to have his Skull (sa crane) fractured in a most violent manner. A surgeon was immediatly sent for; a difficult Operation was successfully performed; and he was brought to his Senses. The Symptoms have ever since been very favourable; tho' his Situation is still very dangerous. It is impossible to conceive any one more universally regretted. No body believes that the Duke would survive his Son's Death: His Condition is in a great Measure concealed from Lady Tavistoke, who is six months gone with child. I sent about an hour ago to Bedford House that I might give you the most recent Account, and had a very favourable Answer. As it is thought, that the four first Days were most critical, there are now good hopes entertained of his Recovery.

Mde de Boufflers wou'd probably tell you, that I am now, from a Philosopher, degenerated into a petty Statesman, and am entirely occupyed in Politics. I am too well acquainted with our usual Fluctuations and Revolutions to believe that this Avocation will be durable. But whatever I am or wherever I live, believe me to be, with great Sincerity, Dear Madam,

 Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume.
