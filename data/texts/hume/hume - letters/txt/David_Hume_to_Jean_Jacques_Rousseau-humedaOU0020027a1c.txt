My dear Sir

I am very anxious to hear of your safe Arrival at Wooton; and above all, that the Place answers our expectation. Mr Davenport has been with me this morning. He expresses the same Anxiety: He still insists on your Promise, that you are to tell freely every Circumstance, that displeases you. It shall be remedy'd if in his power; If Wooton in general displeases you, he hopes that a small farm-house, near his other House in Cheshire, may be more to your Mind. If that shou'd not be agreeable, he will lend his Assistance to settle you to your mind in some other place; and he says, that he will never lose sight of you, till he see you contented and easy. The same is the great Object of my Ambition.

Mr Stewart sent me his Account the Morning after your Departure. He made an Apology for not sending it the Evening before. He was so busy that he cou'd not wait on you before your Departure. I have pay'd the Account and have received payment from Mr Davenport. I send it enclos'd.

Adieu, My Dear Friend: May Health and Happiness ever attend you. My Compliments to Mlle le Vasseur. I am yours with great Sincerity

Lisle Street Leicester Fields. 22d of March 1766

P.S.

Mr Gosset has brought me one of your Models, which, he says, you intended as a Present. Pray, inform me to whom I must send it.
