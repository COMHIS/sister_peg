Dear Sir

The Dedication of my Dissertations to Mr Hume was shown to some of his Friends here, Men of very good Sense, who were seiz'd with an Apprehension, that it wou'd hurt that Party in the Church, with which he had always been connected, and wou'd involve him, and them of Consequence, in the Suspicion of Infidelity. Neither he nor I were in the least affected with their Panic; but to satisfy them we agreed to stand by the Arbitration of one Person, of great Rank & of known Prudence; and I promis'd them to write to you to suspend the Publication for one Post, in case you shou'd have resolv'd to publish it presently. Next Post you shall be sure to hear from me; and if we be oblig'd to suppress it, you'll be pleas'd to place the Charges of Print & Paper to my Account. I indorst this Day your two Bills to Mr Alexander Cunning-hame. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant

David Hume.
