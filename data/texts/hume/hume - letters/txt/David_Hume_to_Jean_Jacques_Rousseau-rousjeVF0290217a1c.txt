I send you, My Dear Sir, the Copy of the King of Prussia's Rescript, which was sent me by your Friend, Monsr Peyrou. He tells me, that this Piece was printed by Voltaire, who, however, cou'd not forbear making one Alteration in it. For in Page 2 Line 14 instead of au Sieur Rousseau, he has substituted a un homme. Such a Reluctance he had to name you in any particular that might be to your Honour or Advantage.

Your Letter to General Conway has given me great Uneasyness; as it did also to the General. We can see no Reason why you shoud retract the Consent you had once given, to accept this Testimony of His Majesty's Goodness towards you. You said in your Letter to Lord Mareschal, that the Secrecy of the Pension was rather an agreeable Circumstance to you, as it showed that the Pension was merely the Effect of Esteem in the King, not of Vanity, in affecting to appear an Encourager of Letters. General Conway hopes, that you will return to the same way of thinking, and that you will write to him to notify your Acceptance.

But there was another Circumstance of your Letter, which gave me still greater Uneasyness: You mention some great Calamity or Affliction which you have met with, and which has thrown you into the most profound Melancholy. General Conway and My Lady Aylesbury fancy, that this is the Letter of Mr Walpole. If so, they desire me to inform you, that Mr Walpole is very sorry to have given you so much Offence; and that that idle Piece of Pleasantry was meant to be entirely secret, and the publication of it was contrary to his Intention and came from Accident. Mr Walpole has expressed the same Sentiments to me. I have this Moment received a Letter from Lord Mareschal who seems to be in good Health. I am Yours with great Sincerity
