Dear Sir

This Letter will be deliverd to you by Dr Henry, concerning whom and whose work, I have wrote you by the Post: I have rather chosen that Method of conveying my Sentiments than by a Letter of Recommendation, which are often understood to be formal things and carry less weight with them. You will there see, that my Esteem of Dr Henry and his Performance are very sincere and cordial.

 I am Dear Sir 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant



David Hume.
