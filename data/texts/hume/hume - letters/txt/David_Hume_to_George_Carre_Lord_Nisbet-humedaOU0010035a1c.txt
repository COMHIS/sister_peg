Dear Sir

'Tis natural for a Man, that has not been much accustom'd to sollicit for Favours, to be a little shy in that particular; especially if there is requir'd in the Person to whom he applys himself, not only a Good-Will to him, but a good Opinion of him, in order to the granting his Request. Yet this is my present Case. I am inform'd, that your Cousins, my Lord Haddington & Mr Baillie, are going abroad, & want a Governour. I have an Intention of offering my Service, & know no Person so proper to apply to as yourself; & the more so, that I hope, if you do not think the Matter feasible or proper, you will be so free as to tell me so. If you approve of the Project, you both know the proper Persons to apply to, & will be able to give me your Advice in that Respect. There are many inviting Circumstances, with regard to these young Gentlemen, which have engag'd me to make this Step. They have a very good Character; I have the Honour to be their Relation (which gives a Governour a better Air in attending his Pupils) And I have at present some Leizure to bestow. As I was uncertain whether they might not be provided, & wou'd not willingly be nam'd in the Affair, if it do not succeed, I desire it may be conducted with all possible Secrecy. I have enclos'd this to Harry Home, as not knowing your Direction. He will confer with you about the Matter; & to your Friendship & Discretion, I commit myself. I am

Dear Sir 
Your most affectionate humble Servant 
David Hume.
