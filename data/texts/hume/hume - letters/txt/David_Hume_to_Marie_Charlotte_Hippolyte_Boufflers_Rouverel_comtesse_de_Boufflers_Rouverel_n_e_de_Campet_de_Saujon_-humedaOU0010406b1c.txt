Paris 19 October, 1763.

Madam,

It was with much regret I received the letter with which your Ladyship was pleased to honour me. Your Ladyship was the first person to whom I had proposed to pay my respects at Paris; and I found myself disappointed, for some time, of so flattering an expectation; but I was still more afflicted on account of your bad health, which had detained you in the country.

I had however the pleasure soon after to meet with your good friend, M. Dusson, who assured me, that you had never been in any danger, and that you was now in a fair way of recovery.

We both agreed however that the consequences of your distemper were sometimes troublesome, and required care and attention to prevent them; and it is in order to recommend that attention I give you the present trouble. I have as yet had but two days' experience of this city; but have great reason already to praise the politeness and hospitality, for which it is so famous. A more quiet manner of sliding through life would perhaps suit better my habits and turn of mind; but it is impossible not to be grateful to persons that show such a desire of pleasing one, and making him happy.

 With great regard, Madam, 
Your most obedient humble servant,



David Hume.
