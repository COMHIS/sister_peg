Edinburgh 31 Aug. 1771

Dear Sir

I am very sorry, I had not the Good fortune to see, when you was so good as to call on me. I only came home the day before Yesterday; and have not yet seen Dr Robertson: So that I can give you no Answer; but shall take care to know his mind soon on that head

 I am Sir 
Your most obedient Servant



David Hume
