Dear Sir

I have had Lord Holderness man with me, he's a very intelligent person seems to understand the management of land, a good mechanick, & a much better Botanist than Rousseau. He approves of the Plough & intends making use of one on my Lords Lands.

The purport of the letter to General Conway is amazing. I never heard him mention the name of the Ministry so am surprised he should have wrote any thing about them. He did not so much as know the names of those employ'd in administration. If he has wrote any thing of that sort, it must have been whilst I was at London, for to my certain knowledge, his pen was engaged in quite other matters, at the time I left him.

I have took it into my head he's gone towards Orleans. Latter end of last year his Governante lost her Mother, some small matter was to come to her, she told me that she wanted much to go for a while into that country. I own I long vastly to know where he is; & how things are with him. I fancy Mr Du Gems will have heard from him. He has left three large trunks at Wootton, & I suspect many of his manuscripts, some I'm sure are, because he gave them me to lock up. If no mischief happens in France I almost imagine he will return. My Gout has not left me.

 I am Dear Sir Your Most Obedient Humble Servant
