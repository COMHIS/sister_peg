Dear Sir

I have been constantly at this place ever since I did my self the pleasure of writing my last letter to you, in which I said I should leave [for] Wootton in three or four days. The rains have continued from that time to this, which have kept me every day at home. Mr Rousseau is at Wootton & I purpose going over to see him as soon as the weather settles. What you observe of him is certainly very true, his refusal amaz'd me, but I hope the letter you have now sent will have the Effect, your goodness, & care for his interest desires it should have, his heart is good, & tender, but his sensibility too exquisite. As he never spoke to me upon the Subject of the Pension, I cant imagine what his thoughts are, but If I may venture to Guess, it seems as if he thought it not right, after having refus'd it from one King, to accept it from another. He is I am Sure busy in writing, & it should be some large affair, by the quantity of Paper he bought. His health is but precarious & the frequent returns of his disorder, must make his temper sometimes uneven.

You must not forget your promise of letting me have the honor of your Company as you pass this way. The Effects of my plough are visible with a witness, that Land done with it a year & half ago, is six times as good as it was before that operation.

I shall long to hear Mr R. has changd his mind, perhaps when I see him he'll tell me, for in most things he's quite communicative.

I am Dear Sir

Your most Obliged & Obedient 
Hble Sert
