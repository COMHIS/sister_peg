Dear Sir

This week I received a letter from Rousseau dated Fleury under Meudon, wrote with great complaisance, & returns a thousand thanks for all the civilities he received from me at Wootton. Says that he is not fix'd as to the place of his future residence, but that he will inform me as soon as he has made choice of One.

The Stile of this is vastly different from some of the last of those which he wrote in England, no mention of Captivity's, no wild imaginations of any kind, but intirely calm & composed, I heartily wish he may continue so, then sure he will be somewhat happy.

I am Dear Sir

Your Most Obedient 
Humble Servant 
Richd Davenport
