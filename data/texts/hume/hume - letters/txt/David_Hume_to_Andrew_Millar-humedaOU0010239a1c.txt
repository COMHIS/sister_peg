Dear Sir

I have sent off to day by the Stage Coach the other two Volumes of my Works. Please to order the Printer to keep this Copy of all the four Volumes, that, in case you print an Edition in Twelves, it may be done from them, and any Errata of the Quarto Edition be avoided. If you think proper, I shall make an Index to the Quarto Edition; and for that Reason desire that a Copy of it be soon sent me, either by the Post or the Stage Coach.

Last Autumn, Mr Hope deliverd me a Letter & the Copy of a new Book from the Count Algarotti, a famous Virtuoso of Venice. I have sent in the enclosd an Answer to it, where I also told the Count that I had sent him a Copy of the four Dissertations, which will shortly be publishd. I must therefore desire you to bind up neatly a Copy of these Dissertations, & send it to Mr Hope with the enclos'd. I expect 18 Copies here by Sea. I wont trouble you to send Copies of such a Trifle to any body in London.

I shall transact your two Bills either this Week or the next.

 I am Dr Sir Yours sincerely
