Dear Sir,

I have your letter and have to thank you for your very judicious remarks. I find it would be a mere vulgar cowardice to delay the publication until such a time as the effects of the mischief become irreparable and I do not see the necessity of so large a work as you suggested, for besides the expense we have to consider the number of volumes which the public interested would buy. Hence it is that the truth of a whole library could be so well concentrated and analyzed that a few scanty volumes would contain all the matter of fact with regard to the most important things in life. In the Manuscript sent herewith you will notice that I have answered Mr Wallace fully and sufficiently and I think it will give you entire satisfaction. It has cost me much trouble and no little anxiety.

 I remain 
Your very Obedient Servant
