Edinburgh 3 of June 1772.

Dear Sir

I have receivd a Copy of the new Edition of my Essays and the four first Volumes of my History, with both which I am very well pleasd with regard to the Paper and Print. I have carefully perusd the Essays, and find them very correct, with fewer Errors of the Press, than I almost ever saw in any book; and I give you, as well as Mr Strahan, thanks for the care that has been taken of them. The four Volumes of history passd thro' my own hands; so that nothing needs be said of them. I fancy the other Volumes will not be finishd; so as to be publish'd this Season; but they will be ready early in the Winter.

 I am Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume.
