Edinburgh beginning of Feb. 1753

Sir

I have no Exception to the Phraze you mention. Yesterday, there was read in the Society an Advertisement which Lord Morton desird you should insert. If it be not printed off, I shoud be pleas'd that in mentioning my Name, you wou'd call me Secretary to the Society.

 I am Sir 
Your most humble Servt
