London April 26. 1765.

[. . .] Now that I have troubled you with all the public news, let me enter into something that regards yourself. I am sorry to see Lord Elibank so much out of humour in regard to you. He showed me a letter you had written to him and his answer. If I could disapprove of any thing you ever wrote it would be of th[e spir]it of that letter, though I am much [?] approving of his answer. In short [I] wish that neither of these letters had ever been written, as I do not like to see old friendship's break up, especially between men of merit and who have been mutually obliged to each other. I wish you could come to understand each other better than at present you seem to do. He goes from hence to Scotland in a few days, and I think carries with him some degree of acrimony against you which I should wish greatly to see sweetened [. . .] .
