Dear Ferguson

There has been a long Silence between us; but not Forgetfulness; at least, not on my part. Hepburn's Affair is finish'd: It is my last Work, and cost me some Effort: I think I have therein very well discharged my Duty of Head of the Church of Scotland; and have [xxx] contributed to promote a Divine of singular Piety and Orthodoxy. We go out to morrow or next day; which is an Event far from being disagreeable to me. I shall now be restord to my literary Leisure; and am tempted, by the Importunity of Friends, to think of continuing my History for two or three Reigns more. It is well if I find Pleasurd in the Occupation; but I can [xxx] discover no Reason why I should be at any Pains about it. Andrew Millar, very naturally, thinks money will be [xxx] a great Temptation to me: Others, equally silly, talk to me of Fame: Some, with no less Reason, of Truth. You may judge, from my past Experience, how sanguine I must have become with regard to all these Objects. The Devil is in it, if I have not learnd by this time, how little disposd the World is to receive Truth; of [xxx] how little Value their Opinion is; and what a moderate Fortune is sufficient, for all the Necessaries of Life. You[r]s sincerely
