Paris Thursday [September 1765].

I passed the last evening in company with Gatti at Madame de Rochefort's. Never was man in such agonies of despair: he has all the sensibility of an honest man, whose reputation is unjustly attacked, and who finds the world against him. He talks of leaving the world, of flying instantly from Paris, of throwing up life: you would have been moved with compassion for him, and could not but have entertained a good opinion of his character. After all, what has he been guilty of? A mistake. Good God! reproach a physician with a mistake; as if they were not, all of them, in danger of a mistake, in every judgment which they form. I beseech you recall your usual generosity; and protect innocence, perhaps merit, opposed by calumny and prejudice. He has heard, dear Madam, that you are his enemy: I find that it is a sensible addition to his other distresses.

Mademoiselle L'Espinasse is dangerously ill of the small pox. I am glad to find that D'Alembert forgets his philosophy on that occasion.
