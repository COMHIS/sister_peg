I earnestly beg of you not to allow this Copy to go out of your House till the Book be publishd. Your Attention to this is of Consequence.

Dear Mure

I have sent to Sharpe a copy of my History, of which I hope you will tell me your Opinion with Freedom.

Finding, like a Friend, 
Something to blame, & something to commend.



The first Quality of an Historian is to be true & impartial; the next to be interesting. If you do not say, that I have done both Parties Justice; & if Mrs Mure be not sorry for poor King Charles, I shall burn all my Papers, & return to Philosophy.

I shall send a Copy to Paris to l'Abb√© le Blanc, who has translated some other of my Pieces; and therefore your Corrections & Amendments may still be of Use, & prevent me from misleading or tiring the French Nation. We shall also make a Dublin Edition; & it were a Pity to put the Irish farther wrong than they are already. I shall also be so sanguine as to hope for a second Edition, when I may cor[rect all Errors.] You know my Docility.

 [Oct. 1754.]
