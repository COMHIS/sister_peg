Dear Sir

The Bearer, Mr Gosset, an ingenious Artist, is desirous to have a model of you, at the earnest application of several Gentlemen, who wish to adorn their Closets with it. He assures me, that it will not cost you above half an hour to sit to him. I could not refuse so reasonable a Request; and I hope you will excuse this Liberty. I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume

P.S.

Mr Davenport tells me, that there is a Retour Chaise for Ashburn. He has made a Bargain for you and Mlle Le Vasseur. It goes off on Wednesday MorningÂ , and he will send his Coach for you  on Tuesday Evening.
