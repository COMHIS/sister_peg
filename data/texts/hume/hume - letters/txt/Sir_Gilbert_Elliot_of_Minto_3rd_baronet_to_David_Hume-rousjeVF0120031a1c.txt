Dear Sir

 As soon as I receiv'd your letter, I apply'd to Mr Home who had also heard from you by the same post, & desir'd him to make all possible enquiry after Mr Rousseau; If he be in London we shall certainly find him out, & I need not assure you that both on account of his own merit and your recommendation, I shall not fail to show him every attention in my power: I shoud doubt from the known character of the man, whether he woud accept a pension if it coud be procur'd, for him, & shoud rather apprehend, that, tho' this Government will protect & tolerate the boldness of his pen, yet It will hardly reward it. Rousseau is not the only man of genius, the singularity of whose opinions has intercepted the rewards due to the superiority of his talents.  I really admire both the sentiments & eloquence which mark some of his writings, 'tis amazing how he coud compose or publish so extraordinary a peice as his Eloize, many of the letters are fine, but the tendency of the whole book is pernicious, & the composition throughout faulty & tedious. His stile tho' certainly nervous & often rising to the sublime, yet I cannot help thinking departs much from the natural simplicity of the best writers, & in the shortness of his sentences, his frequent contrasts, interrogations & exclamations resembles more the age of Seneca or Pliny, than of Caesar & Cicero. The parts of his philosophy which he draws from the Stoick School, & the study of the Spartan manners, seem to me to be founded on the largest & deepest views of human nature considered in an abstract light, & distinct from all established & prevailing Systems of Government, But can anything be less judicious than to consider the pursuits of Frenchmen, & the manners of French Ladys in the present age, with a constant relation to an imaginary standard of perfection subsisting only in his own mind, & which perhaps the most favourable and concur[r]ing circumstances of habit, culture & discipline coud hardly establish. In short I must think that Mr Rousseau woud have been a much better Member of Society & a more useful tho' perhaps less entertaining writer, if he mingled more with Mankind, gave less indulgence to his love of singularity, and attributed fairly to every different stage & gradation of Society such vices & such virtues as may be avoided, or are attainable in that particular state & situation of mankind of which he happens to treat. I should really wish to read an imaginary description of a people form'd upon the stoical System, & agreeable to the principle of Spartan manners & discipline; Rousseau is capable to write an excellent & consistent Utopia upon this idea, & it woud give real satisfaction to his reader. But it only puzzles & tortures one's imagination, to find scatter'd thro' his writings so many deep & true pictures of human manners, which however appear ridiculous merely by being placed in a false light, I mean by being apply'd to a state of Society, where they coud not exist. I give you joy of your house, & hope you are not idle.

Yours &c
