Dear Sir

I was a little surprizd to hear from Mr Dalrymple, that some Papers of Lord Clarendon had fallen into your hands, by which it appears, that, so early as Fouquet's Administration, which ended in 1661 or 1662, Charles the second receivd a Pension from France of two Millions a Year, a Transaction known to Lord Clarendon. I own, that without the best Authority, this Fact will appear incredible: The Greatness of the Sum, which makes near 170.000 pounds Sterling, is an Objection: The King of France had at that time no Object, in which Charles cou'd assist him: It is difficult to reconcile this Fact to many Passages which I remember in D'Estrades's Memoirs: There had very near been a Squabble between France & England about that time, with regard to the trifling Object of the Flag: All these and many other Reasons make me suspect, that Mr Dalrymple had mistaken your Meaning. I must beg of you to inform me in a few Lines of the Truth; and also whether you intend to give these Papers to the Public. Perhaps, as Charles was at that time very much straitend for Money, and was really ill usd by the Parliament in point of Revenue, he might borrow some Money from Lewis, and repay it afterwards from parliamentary Grants. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Douglas: I say nothing to Mr Pulteney because I will have no Intercourse with Wilkites. Good God! how can a man degrade himself to that degree? But I beg my humble Respects to Mrs Pulteney: I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant
