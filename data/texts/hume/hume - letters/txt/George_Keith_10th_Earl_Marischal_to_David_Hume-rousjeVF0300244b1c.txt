Potsdam 15 August 1766.

I have three of yours, the last by Mr Franklin only yesterday, sent me from Utrecht by mr Brown. I am much grieved by what happens between you and J. J., for still I can not suspect him, of black ingratitude in his heart which many now accuse him of, but I believe his warm imagination has realised to him suspicions that have not the least foundation, as I know being well informed of your warm and hearty friendship to him, and having seen with what tendernesse and regard you did all in your power to serve him; his écart afflicts me on his account more than yours, who have, I am sure, nothing to reproach yourself. It will be good and humain in you, and like le Bon David, not to answer; which you say is your opinion. J.J. is already attacked, and will be more so on all hands; his enemys pursued him with inveterate malice when they had nothing in truth to say; now he has given them hold, they are all upon him. If some body should accuse me of having murdered Henry IV of France, I should not justify myself, because the accusation would not gain the least credit. . . .
