My Dear Mich.

I was very much surprizd & very sorry to hear from you, that we must not expect you soon. I wonder you make any stop about a horse, since we could send in for you, & as to your Letters from Jamey you would get them so much the sooner by Berwick. I hope there is no misfortune befallen him, that you need be so much upon the Guard. Our Folks goes into Town agst the first of Aprile; I wish you could come out then, with a return of their horses, if your own be not right, & not wait for their coming out again, wch will be a fortnight after. I am in pretty good Health Just now & I think in better health these two months than for two Years before. I am afraid we shall never get a good long settled meeting together, till we must part, & then we must wait till Fortune join us. I thank you for your trouble about Baile. I hope it is a Book you will yourself find Diversion & Improvement in
