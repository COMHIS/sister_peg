Sir

I have us'd the Freedom of sending under Cover to you a Letter to Mr Spence; because I did not know how to direct to that Gentleman. All the Contents of it regard Mr Blacklocke, and are equally your Concern, as Mr Spence's & that of every Lover of Ingenuity. I have therefore left the Letter open, that, if you have Leizure, you may read it. I esteem myself very much beholden to you for the Pains you have taken upon my Recommendation. I own, that I still regard Sir George Lyttleton as our Sheet Anchor; and am infinitely desirous to have him better acquainted with Mr Blacklocke's Case.

Your Criticisms on his Poems might also be of great Service to him. I am Sir

 Your most obedient Servant
