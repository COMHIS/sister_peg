My dear Sir

I write you both to Davenport and to Wooton, but my chief Letter goes to Wooton; because from your Account, I have best Reason to think you are there. I beseech you keep the Duplicate of my last letter to Rousseau, which I desird you to open and to read at Davenport; and I wish you woud either send it to me or a Copy of it by the first Post. I shall not have Peace of Mind till you have met with this Man, and have given me an Account of your Conference with him. Have Compassion, I beseech you, on the most signal Beneficence, exposd to the blackest ingratitude. You have a heart formd for feeling that cruel Situation. I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient humble

Servant 
David Hume
