Dear Sir

I doubt not but you are desirous of having Accounts of your wild Philosopher as you us'd to call him; Mr Walpole has return'd from France a few days ago, who tells me, that he left him at Clich√©, a Place within a League of Paris, where he lives in a very retir'd and obscure manner. I fancy he may pay you another Visit; For this Tranquillity is not what he desires, and if he cannot get Persecution, he will at least seek after Variety. May I use the Freedom to put you in mind of bringing up with you all the Letters he wrote on his Departure from you and afterwards? there are some who are of Opinion, that the letter lately publishd is not genuine, but is rather contriv'd as a Banter upon him. I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient and most humble

Servant 
David Hume.
