Dear Baron

I am sorry, that I shoud correspond so ill to your very obliging Letter, by telling you, that I cannot propose to see you till you come to town next Winter. I am engagd in the building a house, which is the second great Operation of human Life: For the taking a Wife is the first, which I hope will come in time: And by being present I have already prevented two capital Mistakes, which the Mason was falling into; and I shall be apprehensive of his falling into more, were I to be at a Distance. I must therefore renounce the hopes of seeing you at your own house this Autumn, which I assure [you] I do with much Regret. My Compliments to Mrs Mure & the young Ladies. Please tell Miss Kitty, that my Coat is much admird even before I tell, that it is her Livery. For her Sake, I shall be careful, that it never meet with any such Accident as the last. I am Dear Baron

 Yours very sincerely

David Hume

Edinburgh. 2 Octr 1770

P.S. 
Mr Moore's Verses are really very elegant.
