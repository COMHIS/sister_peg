Jean Jaques Rousseau persecuted for having writ what he thinks good, or rather, as some folks think, for having displeased persons in great power who attributed to him what he never meant, came here to seek retreat, which I readily granted, and the King of Prussia not only approved of my so doing, but gave ne orders to furnish him his small necessarys, if he would accept them; and tho that King's philosophy be very different from that of Jean Jaques, yet he does not think that a man of an irreprochable life is to be persecuted because his sentiments are singular, he designs to build him a hermitage with a little garden which I find he will not accept, nor perhaps the rest which I have not yet offered to him. He is gay in company, polite, and what the french call aimable, and gains ground dayly in the opinion of even the clergy here; his enemys elsewhere, continue to persecute him, he is pestered with anonimous letters, this is not a country for him, his attachment and love to his native Towne is a strong tye to its neighbourhood, the liberty of England and the character of my good and honored friend D. Hume F—i D—r (perhaps more singular than that of J. Jaques, for I take him to be the only historian impartial) draws his inclinations to be near to the F—i D—r, for my part, tho it be to me a very great pleasure to converse with the honest savage, yet I advise him to go to England, where he will enjoy Placidam sub libertate quietem. He wishes to know, if he can print all his works, and make some profit, merely to live, from such an edition. I entreat you will let me know your thoughts on this, and if you can be of use to him in finding him a bookseller to undertake the work, you know he is not interested, and little will content him. If he goes to Brittain, he will be a treasure to you, and you to him, and perhaps both to me (if I were not so old). I have offered him lodging in Keith hall. I am ever with the greatest regard your most obedient servant M.
