Paris 25 of Augt 1765

It is very strange, Dear Baron, that after writing you above seventeen or eighteen Letters at least, by the Post and by private hands, and by all sorts of Conveyance, I can get no Answer either from you or Mrs Mure or the Miss Mures or the Captain or your Swiss Preceptor, or from any one of those numerous Friends, whom I flatterd myself I had in your Family. Are you become such great Folks, that you scorn to acknowledge an old Acquaintance? Or are you all become very indolent and averse to writing Letters? This is a Vice from which I am myself so remote, that I never can excuse it in another.

If you saw Oswald, he woud tell you something about me: And if you see Dr Blair, he will tell you something farther: So I shall say nothing more upon a Subject, about which you seem to have so little concern.

I ask at every body that comes over, if the geographical Situation of the Island is the same as before: If it be, it is the only thing that yields not to this rapid Revolution and Whirl of Fortune.

Please to send the enclosd to Miss Betty Sir James's Sister.

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.
