Dear Sir

I fancy Mr Macleane's Questions are by this time answerd to his Satisfaction: For my Friends at Paris have thought it absolutely necessary to publish a Narrative of the whole Affair between Rousseau and me, translated from an Account I sent them. I believe the World never heard of so ridiculous and absurd an Affair.

Allan Ramsay is in this Country but I have not yet seen him. I spoke to him in London of the Affair you mention; but he says, that there is no Engraver here (I suppose he excepts Strange, who is otherwise employ'd) that is capable of doing a head tolerably. I am much, much better pleasd to have the Edition come out without it: I am indeed averse to the prefixing a Print of the Author, as savouring of Vanity.

I am just now recovering myself of my Habits of Dissipation, and returning to my old Habits of Study & Retreat. I shall not lose Sight of the Object you mention, as soon as I think Affairs are ripe for it. I woud fain see the Prejudices of Faction a little more abated, in order to smooth the way for my Access to the Cabinets of the Great: For really I am not qualify'd for overcoming any Difficulties of that Nature.

About two Years ago, I wrote you, that I had left with my Sister a corrected Copy of my History, which I woud desire her to send you. You wrote to Kincaid who sent for it, and sent it to you in a Parcel of Strahan's. This Circumstance is enterd by Kincaid in his Minute Book of 16 of Octr 1764. When in London, I asked you about this Copy; and you told me, that you had never heard of it. I suppose this is only a Defect of Memory. I shoud be very vext it was lost. Please enquire about it; and if you recover it, be so good as to send it me by the Waggon. I beg my sincere Compliments to Mrs Millar. I hope to be often merry with you & her in your House in Pall-Mall; and I wish both of you much Health & Satisfaction in enjoying it. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant
