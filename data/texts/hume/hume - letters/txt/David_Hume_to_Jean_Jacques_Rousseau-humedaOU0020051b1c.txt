As I have not received any Answer from you, I conclude, that you persevere in the same Resolution of refusing all Marks of His Majesty's Goodness, as long as they must remain a Secret. I have therefore apply'd to General Conway to have this Condition removed; and I was so fortunate as to obtain his Promise, that he wou'd speak to the King for that Purpose. It will only be requisite, said he, that we know previously from M. Rousseau whether he wou'd accept of a Pension publickly granted him, that His Majesty may not be exposed to a Second Refusal. He gave me Authority to write to you on that Subject; and I beg to hear your Resolution as soon as possible. If you give your consent, which I earnestly entreat you to do, I know, that I cou'd depend on the good Offices of the Duke of Richmond, to second General Conway's Application; so that I have no doubt of Success. I am, My Dear Sir, Yours with great Sincerity
