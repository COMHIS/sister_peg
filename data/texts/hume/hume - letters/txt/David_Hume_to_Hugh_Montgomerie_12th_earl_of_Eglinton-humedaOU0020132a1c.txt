Wednesday [Spring 1767].

My Lord

Not finding an Opportunity yesterday of speaking to Lord Hertford in favour of Mr Burney, I spoke to My Lady, and told her the whole Case. She already knows Mr Burney and has an Esteem for him. She said it gave her great Uneasyness & she was sure, woud do so, to my Lord, that he was already engag'd; and she believd, to the Duke of York. It occur'd to me, that his royal Highness's Application might also be in favour of Burney; in which Case, the Matter is easy. If not, it is probable your Lordship may engage him to depart from his Application: For really Mr Burney's Case, independant of his Merit, is very hard and cruel.

 I have the Honour to be 
My Lord 
Your Lordships Most humble & most obedient 
Servant
