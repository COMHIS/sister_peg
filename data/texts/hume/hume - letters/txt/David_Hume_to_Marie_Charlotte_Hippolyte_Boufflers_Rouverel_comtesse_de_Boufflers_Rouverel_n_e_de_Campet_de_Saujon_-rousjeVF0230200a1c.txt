Saturday Forenoon

. . . I have read a great part of Les Lettres de la Montagne. The book in my humble opinion will not do credit to M. Rousseau though it might to another. I disapprove particularly of the seditious purpose of the last letters, which have succeeded but too well at Geneva: for the magistrates of that city, which the author had formerly celebrated with reason as one of the best governed in the world, are in mortal fear every hour of being massacred by the populace. There is the character of a lady, which many people have applied to you: but though the picture be like, I do not believe it was meant for you. If the book were not extremely scarce, I would endeavour to procure you a copy. . . .
