Dear Sir

I am oblig'd to you for the Letter with which you favord me. I fancy, you woud have found part of it answerd, before I received it. This day three Weeks, I sent up the second Volume of my History by the Stage Coach to Mr Millar, which is probably put into your hands by this time. The Alterations I make on this Volume are not very considerable; those I make on the first Volume are more so, particularly in the Reign of James, which requires to be changed in many Places, in order to adjust it to this previous Volume, which I am now composing, and which is nearly finishd. It is for this Reason, I coud wish Mr Millar woud make a new Edition of both at once, and I have told him my Sentiments on that head. His Resolution will probably depend on the Number of Copies, which remain of the first Volume; but as there were only 250 thrown off more than of the Second, I fancy there cannot be many on hand, after all the second are sold off. For there is always a considerable Defalcation in the Sale of second Volumes.

I am really concerned for what you tell me of Mr Millar's being Ill, tho I hope his Aliment will only be slight. I know few who woud make a greater Loss to this Country, especially to the young Men of Letters in it. I propose to see you about the Autumn, when I hope to commence a personal Acquaintance with you.

I am Dr Sir Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume.
