London 2d September, 1761.

Madam,

The instance which your Ladyship has been pleased to give me of your goodness, is so extraordinary and so honourable to me, that it will be in vain for me to attempt expressing the sense of gratitude, with which I am affected. I must always fall short of the just acknowlegments, which I owe on that occasion. My only resource must be to take advantage of the prepossessions, which, I find, your Ladyship has entertained in my favour; and to leave it to your own conjecture, how much a person, who has any sentiments of virtue or sound notion of duty, must be moved by a mark of distinction, conferred with such obliging circumstances.

I am afraid that the present situation of public affairs between the two kingdoms sets at a distance the prospect, which I entertained, of being able to enjoy the company of a person so celebrated for her accomplishments by all who have any knowledge of the Court of France. But if peace, a blessing so desirable to both nations, should be restored to us, and if I can find leisure and an opportunity for a journey to Paris, your Ladyship will easily believe, that I understand my own interests too well not to cultivate every day an acquaintance, which must appear to me so valuable. But as I am sensible, that I shall, in many respects, stand in need of your indulgence, you must excuse me, if I be solicitous to avoid giving you any superfluous trouble, and decline, though with all imaginable sense of gratitude, the obliging offer, with which you have been pleased to honour me.

I am, with the greatest regard, Madam,

 Your Ladyship's most obedient and most obliged Servant,

David Hume.
