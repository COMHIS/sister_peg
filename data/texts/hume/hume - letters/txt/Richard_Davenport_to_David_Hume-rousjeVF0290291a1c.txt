Dear Sir,



I have [not] yet been at Wootton, being prevented by my dear Grandson's having a worm fever; he is now a good deal better, so if  the weather will permit, I intend  going tomorrow.



The receipt of Your two last gave me  much uneasiness; which was augmented by some letters  recd yesterday from Rousseau  along with Yours directed for me at Wootton. Surely there must  have been some excessive great mistakes, it appears to me an heap of confusion of which I can make neither head nor tail;  his letter to you is perfectly astonishing, never any thing, was, so furious, so — I protest I dont know what to call it, I long to see him, he certainly will tell some reason or other that could induce him to write in that manner. Till I have seen him I can give no sort of answer to Your Queries, as he never spoke one syllable to me about any difference at all.  I can't possibly before Saturdays post, as in this part of the country, we have only 3 days in a week to send letters to Town.



 You desird me to burn the duplicate after reading, that signifies nothing, for I can send you the other which I recd yesterday from Wootton.



Good God he must be most excessively out of the way, about this pension, in short I have not patience to add one word more, till I  hear what he can possibly have to say; & then I'll immediately acquaint you



I directly gave orders for the plough,  which will very soon be made, as tis quite simple, & not more work in it than a comon one.



 I can't help being troubled at seeing your Uneasiness, & will with great pleasure do all in my power to assist in freeing you from it, at least I'll do my best endeavours.

 I am Your Most Obedient

Hble Sert
