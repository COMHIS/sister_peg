Sir

In Compliance with Lord Halifax's Desire, an Application was made by Lord Hertford in favour of Monsr Calvet last Tuesday, the first day that his Excellency had occasion to see the French Minister after I was honour'd with yours of the 15th of September. Monsr de Praslin said that, if it were possible, the Laws against Refugees shoud be dispens'd with in Monsr Calvet's Case, and he shoud have leave to sell his Land. I immediatly calld on Monsr Calvet, in order to communicate to him this Intelligence, and to concert with him the Means of rendering his Desire effectual; But found, that he had set out for Gascogny two days before. He is expected to return in six Weeks, at which time, I shall endeavour to serve him by all means in my power; being pleas'd with any Opportunity, by which I can prove how much I am

Sir 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant
