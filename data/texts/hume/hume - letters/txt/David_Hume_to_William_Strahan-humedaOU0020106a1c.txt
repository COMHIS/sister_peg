[Nov. 1766]

Dear Sir

I had a Letter from Mr Millar, complaining of my giving to any other besides him the Publication of my Account of this ridiculous Affair, between Rousseau and me. I am certainly in the wrong, not to have conjoind him, if I coud have imagind, that he woud have thought it worthy of his Attention. I wish you may find it worth while; but I fancy 500 Copies will be more than sufficient to gratify the Curiosity of the Public. It is necessity, not choice, that forces me on this Publication.

If it be not too late, add the following short Note to Page 59 of the Paris Edition, at these words: Des ce moment les imprim√©s ne parlerent plus de moi que d'une maniere equivoque ou malhonnete. So then, I find I am to answer for every Article of every Magazine and Newspaper printed in England: I assure Mr Rousseau I woud rather answer for every Robbery committed on the high way; and I am entirely as innocent of the one as the other. If you have already printed the Page to which this Note refers, print the Note apart, as an Ommission or Erratum. I doubt not but you have already got the Paris Edition otherwise I coud send it you.

 I am Yours etc.

D. H.
