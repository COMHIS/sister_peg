Sir,

Your friend is, in a great measure, recover'd of his pain; but is still weak and low; so that it may be some days before he chooses to see company. If I find him well, I shall send in the chaise on Friday, unless you countermand it. I wrote you on Saturday last. This comes by a servant whom we have sent to town.

 Monday, 10 o'clock.
