Dear Sir

The Picture which Donaldson has done for me is a Drawing; and in every body's Opinion, as well as my own, is the likest that has been done for me, as well as the best Likeness. Since you still insist that an Engraving shoud be made from it, we are more likely to have a good Engraving made than by any other Means. I shall however be glad to sit to Ferguson.

I intend to give up all my Leizure time to the Correction of my History, and to contrive more Leizure than I have possessd since I came into public Office. I had run over four Volumes; but I shall give them a second Perusal, and employ the same or greater Accuracy in correcting the other four. I shall read carefully all the Records in the Paper Office, as far back as they go, and shall leave nothing untry'd that may bestow the greatest Exactness upon it. For this Reason, as well as many others, I woud not have you precipitate this Edition, which is probably the last, that I may have occasion to make. I woud wish to leave that Work as little imperfect as possible to Posterity.

I shoud be glad to see you when you come to Town. But why do you out again? It is time that you & Mrs Millar shoud be taking Shelter in this Metropolis.

 I am Dear Sir 
Yours sincerely
