My Dearest friend

The Principal design of this Letter is to Recommend to your particular Attention the Count de Sarsfield, the best and the most agreable friend I had in france. Introduce him, if you find it proper, to all the friends of your absent friend, to Oswald and to Elliot in Particular. I cannot express to you how anxious I am that his stay in London should be rendered agreeable to him. You know him and must know what a plain, worthy honourable man he is. I have enclosed a letter for him which you may either send to him or rather, if the weighty affairs of state will permit it, deliver it to him yourself. The letter to Dr Morton you may send by the Penny Post.

My Business here is Study in which I have been very deeply engaged for about a Month past. My Amusements are long, solitary walks by the Sea side. You may judge how I spend my time. I feel myself, however, extremely happy, comfortable and contented. I never was, perhaps, more so in all my life.

You will give me great comfort by writing to me now and then, and by letting me know what is passing among my friends at London. Remember me to them all particularly to Mr Adams's family and to Mrs. Montague.

What has become of Rousseau? Has he gone abroad, because he cannot continue to get himself sufficiently persecuted in Great Britain?

What is the meaning of the Bargain that your Ministry have made with the India Company? They have not, I see prolonged their Charter, which is a good circumstance. What are you going to do, or rather [   ]
