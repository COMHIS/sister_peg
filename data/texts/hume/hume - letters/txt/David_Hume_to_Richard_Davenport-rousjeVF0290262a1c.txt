Dear Sir

Your guest is not a little whimsical. He made me no Reply, when I endeavour'd to perswade him to accept of His Majesty's Bounty, even tho a Secret: Upon which I made a new Application to General Conway, that he would prevail on his Majesty to depart from this Condition. The General only requires, as is reasonable, that Mr Rousseau shou'd promise to accept, in case the King be pleas'd to bestow on him a Pension publickly. I have wrote him the enclosd  for that Purpose, in case he be with you at Davenport. I have also wrote to Wooton under Direction to your Steward, in case he be at that Place. If he be at Wooton, you may open & read & burn the enclosd

I am Dear Sir

Your most obedient & most humble Servant
