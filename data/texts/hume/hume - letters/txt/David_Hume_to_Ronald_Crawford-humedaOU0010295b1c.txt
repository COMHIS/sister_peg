Dear Ronald

You have here enclosd my Letter to Lord Hopton, which, I hope, is properly express'd. If you choose I should make any Alterations on it, please inform me. It cannot now surely be too early to move in that Business. Be so good, therefore, as to seal it & send it to his Lordship; seconding it with your good Offices, and informing him that you have my Direction. I live in the same House with Veitch; & therefore please to write under his Cover.

I have wrote to John Dingwell to act in this Affair as may be requisite. If Lord Hopton wants a Copy of my Agreement with the Marquess, he will send it you: And if a Decree of the Session be requisite, he will take the proper steps. I trust chiefly to your Friendship in the Conduct of this Affair; and am Dear Ronald

 Your most obedient Servant
