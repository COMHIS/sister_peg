Dear Sir

This Letter will be deliver'd to you by two Gentlemen, Friends & Relations of Mine, Mr Hume, one of our principal Clerks of Session, & Dr Hume, his Brother. They are travelling thro' England, for Health, Amusement, & Curiosity; and having told me, that they intended to pass by Birmingham, I resolv'd to use the Freedom of recommending them to your Acquaintance, and desiring you to show them what is curious in your industrious & active Town. The Doctor in particular will chop Chymistry & Physic & natural Philosophy with you as long as you please; and both of them, you will find very well worth your Acquaintance.

You must also understand, that I am very well pleas'd with this Expedient, to send my Friends to you, in order to keep you in mind of me, till I shall be able to knock at your Gate myself, which I intend to do, whenever I pass to London; & that I believe will be about this time twelvemonth.

I hope you do not persevere in your king-killing, antimonarchical Principles, which I never cou'd reclaim you from, when you was here. But I fancy, you thought I became a better Bairn towards the End of the Volume, of which you did me the Favor to peruse the Beginning. Pray, how stand I in the opinion of your Club of Loyalists? I forget their Name: But I fancy, I am but little more in their good Graces than Yourself: They will probably think, that if you once depose a King, you may make a Fricassee of him afterwards.

I saw our Friend, Russel, two days ago: He is in very good Health. We frequently meet & talk of you. My Friend, Dr Hume, is a great Chymist; so a Dash of Aquafortis in his Sauce will be very acceptable to him. But Mr Hume, his Brother, has but a weak Stomach; and a little plain beat Butter will be better for him.

My Compliments to Mrs Roebuck. I am Sir

Your most obedient humble Servant 
David Hume
