I ask you, Madam, ten thousand Pardons; but neither for my Neglect nor Forgetfulness: For I am not capable of either with regard to you: But for my Idleness and Dissipation; Business and Occupation: For there is part of all, as the Cause, why I have not waited on you. But I wrote you a Letter (which I am afraid you have not receiv'd) in which I told you of my Consultation with Monsr Duclos, and the Reasons why I coud not enter into the Affair between you and Mde Geoffrin: I also recommended Monsr Helvetius as the most proper Person, to set all to Rights. I found, that you had previously entertaind the same Idea; since that Gentleman told me that he had been so fortunate as to succeed in his Negotiation. I can now only say, that your Behaviour, in the Eyes of all the World has done you Honour; and I congratulate you on it. I will not send you your Manuscript, but will wait on you with it. I believe I told you that I woud not have my Print prefixd to the Sale Volumes of my History. Pray, order your Bookseller to send a Copy of these two Volumes to Made Geoffrin on their first Publication. I know not what to say as to the binding. Perhaps, she has the other Volumes differently bound. Do you not think it were best for me to send her all the Volumes handsomely bound, as the best Return of her Gallantry towards me.

I have the honour to be with great Truth, Madam 
Your most obedient humble Servant
