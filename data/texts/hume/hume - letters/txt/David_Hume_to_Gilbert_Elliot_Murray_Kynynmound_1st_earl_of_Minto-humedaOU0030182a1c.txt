Dear Gilbert

I send you the enclos'd, in order to be communicated to Mr Liston, whom I know not how to direct to. He is the most proper Person whom I can think of, for answering the Intentions of the Court of Parma; and if he thinks proper to accept I shall recommend him to my Friend, who is Intendant of Limosin and a man of singular good Understanding. The Money offerd is equivalent at least to three times the Sum in London, and the Conditions are very honourable: The only Danger is, that a young Man like Mr Liston may go and settle during some Years in Parma; and after he is in a manner forgot in his own Country, the Minister, who sets the Project on foot may dye or be disgrac'd, and the Professor be shaken off. I shall write this Difficulty to M. Turgot and Mr Liston may weigh it in the mean time. I think he need not be discourag'd by the Circumstance of his not speaking Italian: He cannot fail soon to attain it in the Country. Make my Excuses to him for my not writing to himself, as I do not know how to direct to him, and this Letter I desire him to consider as address'd to him. After he has read Mr Turgot's Letter and copyd it, if he pleases, he will be so good as to return it me under Cover to Sir Gilbert, with his Resolution upon the whole, as soon as he has come to one.

Sir Gilbert has allow'd me to read a Book newly published, wrote by your Friend Mr Gilbert Stewart. It gives me a great Esteem of the Author. Please make my Compliments to him. I shall soon write him at greater Length. I am Dear Gilbert

 Your most obedient humble Servant
