Dear Sir,

I met with Ronald Crawfurd yesterday, who told me, that he had seen Lord Hopton's referee, who told him, that the sole difficulty in my affair was with regard to Captain Vincent's powers, and that, if these, or a copy of them cou'd be produc'd, there was no question with regard to my claim. This is the reason why I again give you this trouble; and as I am certain there were such powers, and that you must have a copy of them, I must apply to you, if possible, to send them to me, attested by you, as the real copy which you then took. I need make you no apology, as you have seen my reluctance to give you trouble, where the necessity of the case does not require it. Ronald Crawfurd tells me, that he once saw these powers, but he does not remember exactly the purport of them. I am, Dear Sir,

 Your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume.
