London 22d of May 1767.

Dear Sir:

The very same day, and nearly about the same hour, that you told me you had received a letter from your philosopher, dated at Spalding in Lincolnshire, and expressing his intentions of returning presently to Wootton, did General Conway receive a letter from him, dated at Dover, and expressing his intentions of passing presently over to France. I dread his being arrested there, and used very ill. He complains still of his misery; he is surely very unhappy, and a great object of compassion. He accepts, however, of his pension. He says that all the world in England are prejudiced against him; for which, however, he knows no reason, except his behaviour to me, in which he confesses he might be to blame. I have wrote to some of my friends in France to protect him, if possible.

 I am, dear Sir, yours with great sincerity,

David Hume
