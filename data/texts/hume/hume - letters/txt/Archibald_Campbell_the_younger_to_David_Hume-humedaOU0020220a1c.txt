Thursday Noon

The letter speaks of enclosing a plan for raising money by taxing plays, but the enclosure is not extant; complains of ill fortune, and the bad treatment which the writer had received from his superior officers in the navy; and contains the following statements calculated to excite Hume's sympathy for the man:

The truth is I have been from my infancy upwards a martyr to a religion which I dont remember that I ever believed. Jesus never spoke so true a word as when he said, I am come to set the father against the son, and the son against the father. You'll remember the text, and this was my case, and has given me such an inveteracy against that superstition, that were I now a man of note and independant fortune, I would give it wounds as severe but more pointed and direct than either yourself or Dr Middleton have given it, and at the same time set the clergy with all their persecuting laws at defiance. But this I need not now think of.

This, after all, was not unlike Hume's own mental history.
