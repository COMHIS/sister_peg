Edinburgh 12 of August 1776

Dear Sir

Please to make with your Pen the following Correction. In the second Volume of my philosophical Pieces, p. 245, l. 1, and 2, eraze these words, that there is such a sentiment in human nature as benevolence.

This, Dear Sir, is the last Correction I shall probably trouble you with: For Dr Black has promised me, that all shall be over with me in a very little time: This Promise he makes by his Power of Prediction, not that of Prescription. And indeed I consider it as good News: For of late, within these few weeks, my Infirmities have so multiplyed, that Life has become rather a Burthen to me. Adieu, then, my good and old Friend

David Hume

PS.

My Brother will inform you of my Destination with regard to my Manuscripts.

Another Correction.

In the same Page l. 4, instead of possession of it read sentiment of benevolence
