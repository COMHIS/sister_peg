Sir

I have receiv'd the two first Sheets of the Quarto Edition of my philosophical Writings; and am very well satisfy'd with it. Please only to tell the Compositor, that he always employ a Capital after the Colons. Here follow a few Alterations, which I desire you to make on the last published Volume or four Dissertations which are to be inserted in different Places of the Quarto Volume . . . .

Please to get a Copy of the Dissertations from Mr Millar and make these Alterations. Observe also that the two Dissertations, which are to be inserted among the Essays, are to be entitled Essays. The other two are to be inserted in the Places as directed.

I am very well pleas'd to finish the Bargain with Mr Millar. I hope we shall both find our Account in it. I believe his Offer may be reckond very reasonable and even frank and generous. We have only a small Difference about the time of Payment, which I hope will easily be adjusted. If it be not convenient for him to pay the Money in May next, I wou'd delay it till the 2d of August, which is our Lambas term, and woud endeavour to get his Bill discounted, tho' that Practice be not very common in Scotland.

I hope the Douglas has had a good Success in London. The Public will certainly at first be divided. That Simplicity both of Fable and Style are Novelties on the English Stage, and will no doubt meet with Opposition; but they must prevail, I think, at last.

 I am Sir Your most obedient Servant

David Hume.

Ninewells near Berwick 18 April, 1757.

P.S. I return to Edinburgh in a few days.
