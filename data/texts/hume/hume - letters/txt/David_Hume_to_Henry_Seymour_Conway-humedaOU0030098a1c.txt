Paris 18th of August 1765

Sir

As soon as I was honour'd with your Excellency's of the 10th Instant, which was not till Wednesday last, late in the Evening, I sent the enclos'd to the Duke of Praslin, and ask'd his Directions, about the Delivery of His Majesty's Letters to the King and Queen of France. I have not as yet receiv'd any Answer; whence I conjecture, either that he has deliverd them himself, or waits till the Court returns from Compiegne, that I may attend him on that Occasion. I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard

 Sir 
Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant
