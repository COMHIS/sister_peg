Brewer Street 2 of May 1776

Dear Sir

I arrived here yesterday very much improved by my Journey. I have seen no body but Sir John Pringle, who says that he sees nothing alarming in my Case; and I am willing, and consequently ready to believe him. I intend to call on you this forenoon, and shall leave this in case I miss you. I know not yet what Sir John intends to do with me; so am ignorant how long I shall remain in London: But with much to have a Conversation with you; I shall never eat a meal from my own Fireside: but all the Forenoons and Afternoons will be at my Disposal. It will do me Service to drive to your House; so that you need only appoint me by Message or Penny Post an hour any day.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.

P.S.

I lodge at Mrs Perkins, a few doors from Miss Elliots, and next door to Mr Forbes the Surgeon. The Afternoons, if equally convenient for you, will rather be more convenient to me, to call on you.
