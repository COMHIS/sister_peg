London July 18, 1767.

Dear Sir,

I have had a conversation with Lord Shelburne concerning your affairs: he told me that he had long been pre-engaged for the consulship of Nice to the Spanish Ambassador, and could not possibly get free of that obligation. I then mentioned the consulship of Leghorn; but he said he was already engaged for that office to a friend of Mr Dunning, the lawyer. On the whole, I cannot flatter you with any hopes of success from that quarter; even supposing his Lordship were to remain in office, which is very uncertain, considering the present state of our ministry. For of all our annual confusions, the present seems to be the most violent, and to threaten the most entire revolution, and the most important events. As Lord Chatham's state of health appears totally desperate, and as Lord Shelburne's connexion is supposed to be chiefly, if not solely, with him, many people foretell a short duration to the greatness of the last-named minister. Every thing is uncertain: there is a mighty combination to overpower the King. The force of the Crown is great; but is not employed with that steadiness which its friends would wish. I pretend not to foresee, much less to foretell, the consequences.

 I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant,



David Hume.
