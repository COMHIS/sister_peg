Lisle Street Leicester Fields 30 of March 1766

I ask you ten thousand pardons, my dear Friend, for the Cheat attempted to be put upon you: I had not, however, any hand in it; except concealing it. Mr Davenport himself repents of it, and by my Advice is resolved never more to form such a Project: So that you need not be any farther apprehensive on that head.

Nothing can make me Happier, than to find, that your Situation is to your Mind. I hope it will long continue so. Mr Davenport insists on your promise, that you are to inform him, if any Circumstance displease you, that he may endeavour to correct it. You cannot better correspond to his friendly Intentions than by using this Freedom. My good wishes attend you, to whatever place of the World you may retreat; mixed with regreat, that I am so far distant from you.

I have sent you two Letters by the post, under two Covers franked by a Member of Parliament, which pay no postage. If you have refused them, please send for them again, because they may contain Business. I think, that you ought to receive all Letters, that are franked; because they will probably be transmitted either by Mr Davenport or me. I am My dear Sir

 Yours, with the greatest Sincerity,

David Hume
