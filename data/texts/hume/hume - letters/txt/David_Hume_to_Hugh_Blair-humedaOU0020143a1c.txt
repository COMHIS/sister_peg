Dear Doctor

I write you as long as I can frank a Letter: I believe the Kirk of Humbie will go by Sir Gilbert Elliot's Recommendation, not to your Friend; tho' I am not sure.

 We are all again in Confusion: Negotiations for a new Ministry: The fatal month of July approaching: A new Settlement to be made, which will be no Settlement: I fancy I return in a few Weeks to my former Situation: Yours D. H.

London. 18 of June 1767
