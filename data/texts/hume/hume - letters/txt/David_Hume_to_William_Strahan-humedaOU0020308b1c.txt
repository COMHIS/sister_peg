Edinburgh 11 of Feby 1776

Dear Sir

Last Monday, I sent to the Newcastle Waggon the four first Volumes corrected of my History. They are directed to Mr Cadell. You will see by the Margins, that I have not been idle: And as the Corrections have cost me a great deal of care and Attention, I am anxious that the Books be safely deliver'd. They may arrive about three Weeks hence; about which time, if Mr Cadell does not receive them, I beg, that he would take the trouble of enquiring about them; and as soon as they come to hand, let me know of it by a Line. The other Volumes will be ready, whenever the Press demands them; of which you will be so good as to inform me in time.

I hope you will employ one of your most careful Compositors in this Edition: For as it is the last, which, at my Age and in my State of Health, I can hope to see, I wish to leave it correct. I think that it will not be prudent in you, to make this Edition more numerous than the former one.

I wonder what Smith means by not publishing. I am glad to see my Friend Gibbon advertised: I am confident it will be a very good Book; though I am at a Loss to conceive where he finds materials for a Volume from Trajan to Constantine. Be so good as to make my Compliments to him: The Book has not yet arrived here.

 I am Dear Sir very sincerely 
Your most obedient humble Servant



David Hume
