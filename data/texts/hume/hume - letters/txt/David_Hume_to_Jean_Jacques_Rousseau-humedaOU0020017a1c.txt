Dear Sir

I shall call on you to morrow half an hour past two in the Afternoon, in order to attend you to Town.

I have made Enquiries concerning the Viscount d'Ars. I find, he is alive and in health. He is a Widower: and engaged in a Law-suit, which seems of a very delicate Nature, and of an uncertain Issue: It is of Importance; but a full Explication of it, as it wou'd be difficult for me, is not material to Mde de Verdelin.

I hope you remember your Promise, that you are to give me the Receit for playing the Trick of Hocus Pocus, which you mention in your Lettres de la Montagne and which you play'd when at Venice. I have already promised it, on your Faith, to the Countess of Ailesbury, who is impatient to know it. I am, with the greatest Sincerity Dear Sir Your most obedient Servant
