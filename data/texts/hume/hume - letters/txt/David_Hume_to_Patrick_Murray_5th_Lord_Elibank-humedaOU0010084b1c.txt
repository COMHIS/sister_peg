My Lord

I have copy'd out half a dozen of Epigrams, which I hope will give you Entertainment. The Thought in them is indeed little inferior to that in the celebrated Epigrams of Rousseau; tho' the Versification be not so correct. What a Pity! I say this on account both of the Author & myself. For I am afraid I must leave him. Vincent is resolv'd on the Matter; & has wrote me, that my Appointments are too large, & must be diminisht. This, you are sensible, is indirectly bidding me go away. The Matter must be determin'd by Lady Annandale, who does nothing without Sir James Johnstone's Advice; & I wish he may not comply with the Proposal from a false Notion of Frugality. However, I still entertain some Hopes, that, if your Lordship will be so kind as to represent to him, the Ungenteelness, & even Indignity of this way of Proceeding, as well as what I believe to be his own Interest in the Case, he may be prevail'd with to support me. We shall see an Issue of this Matter in a few Posts. I am

My Lord 
Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, 
David Hume.
