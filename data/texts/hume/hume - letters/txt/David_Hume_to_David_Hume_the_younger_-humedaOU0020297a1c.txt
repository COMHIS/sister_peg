St. Andrews Square 30 of Augt 1775.

Dear Davy.

Your Letter gave me Satisfaction, and I approve very much of your Course of Study: But I think you are unreasonably diffident of Yourself with regard to the Copia verborum: You are not wanting in that particular, [consider] ing you as a Beginner; and the Course you take will tend very much to [produce gr] eater Facility, as well as Correctness of Expression. Stylus est optimus [magis]ter eloquenti√¶. These, if not the Words, are the Sense of Quinctilian. For I cite from Memory. You know that the Roman Stylus was the same as the Pen.

I had a Letter to day from Mr Millar, who tells me, that he expects to see you in the first Monday of November.

I do not go to Inverara so soon as I proposd: It will be next week before I set out. I think I am the better for Jaunting; though in the main I shoud better like better to stay at home.

My Compliments to your Mother: I am glad she has heard from Josey; but I wonder what has detain'd him so long at Paris.

I fancy you and Jock are very happy at present in your Field Sports: And your Father will not be displeasd to see the favourable Progress of the Harvest.

 I am Dear Davy Your affectionate Uncle

David Hume
