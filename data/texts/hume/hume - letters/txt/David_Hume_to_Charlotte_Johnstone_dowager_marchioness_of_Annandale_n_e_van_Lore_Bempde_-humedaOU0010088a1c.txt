Madam

I hope your Ladyship will excuse this trouble from a Person, who has not the honour of being personally known to you. My Connexion with Lord Annandale has embolden'd me to use this Freedom.

I had the Honour of a Letter from my Lord Marquess last Spring, inviting me to London, which I accordingly obey'd. He made me Proposals of living with him; & Mr Vincent, in Concert with Sir James Johnstone, mention'd at first the yearly Sallary of 300 Pound as an Allowance which they thought reasonable; because my Lord had always pay'd so much to all the other Gentlemen, that attended him, even when his way of living, in other Particulars, was much more expensive than at present. Since that, Mr Vincent thinks this Allowance too much, & proposes to reduce it from 300 to 150 Pounds. My Answer was, That whatever your Ladyship & my Lord shou'd think my Attendance merited; that I wou'd very willingly accept of. As he still insisted upon the Reasonableness of [his] Opinion, I have us'd the Freedom to apply to your Ladyship, to whose Sentiments every one, that has the Honour of being connected with the Family of Annandale owe so entire a Deference. I shall not insist on any Circumstances in my own Favour. Your Ladyships Penetration will easily be able to discover those, as well as what may be urg'd in favour of Mr Vincent's Opinion. And your Determination shall be entirely submitted to by me.

 I am Madam 
Your Ladyship's most obedient humble Servt.
