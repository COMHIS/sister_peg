Sir

I have been told by Lord Hertford, that the King has been graciously pleas'd to favour me with a Pension of two hundred pounds a Year without Deductions. I set out for Paris with his Lordship to morrow; and I desire you will be so good as to pay the Money, as it becomes due, to Messrs Coutts and Company, Bankers in the Strand.

I am Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant
