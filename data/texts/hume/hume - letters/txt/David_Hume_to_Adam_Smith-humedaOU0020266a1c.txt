St Andrews Square 23 of Novr 1772

Dear Smith

I shou'd agree to your Reasoning, if I coud trust your Resolution. Come hither for some weeks about Christmas; dissipate yourself a little; return to Kirkaldy; finish your Work before Autumn; go to London; print it; return and settle in this Town, which suits your studious, independant turn even better than London: Execute this plan faithfully; and I forgive you.

I was apply'd to, a few days ago, by poor Roby Arbuthnot, in favour of his Son, now 13 years of Age, and a promising boy, as I am told, whom he intends to send to Glasgow, in a view of procuring him an Exhibition at Oxford. You know the State of that Family; and have probably heard that both the Parents of the boy are unfortunate People of Merit. I own, that, trusting to your Humanity, I promisd them your Interest and Advice in that Scheme: I hope you are not pre-engaged for any other Person: Otherwise I cannot doubt of your Concurrence.

Ferguson has return'd, fat and fair; and in good humour, notwithstanding his Disappointment, which I am glad of. He comes over next week, to a house in this neighbourhood. Pray, come over this winter, and join us.

 I am My Dear Smith Ever yours

David Hume
