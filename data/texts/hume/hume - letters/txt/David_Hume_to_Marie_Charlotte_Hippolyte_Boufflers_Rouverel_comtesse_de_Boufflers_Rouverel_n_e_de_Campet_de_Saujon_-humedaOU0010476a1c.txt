Fontainebleau 31 October, 1764

This late incident, which commonly is of such moment with your sex, seems so little to affect your situation either as to happiness or misery, that I might have spared you the trouble of receiving my compliments upon it: but being glad of taking any opportunity to express my most sincere wishes for your welfare, I would not neglect an occasion which custom has authorised.

Receive, then, with your usual, I cannot say, with your constant, goodness, the prayers of one of your most devoted friends and servants. I hope that every change of situation will turn out to your advantage. In vain would I assume somewhat of the dignity of anger, when you neglect me: I find that this wish still returns upon me with equal ardour.

I hear by M. Berlue, that you are to be in Paris on Saturday. I shall be there about that day se'nnight: I hope that your etiquette, which allows you to receive relations and particular friends, opens a wide-enough door for my admission.
