Dear Sir

I have receiv'd by the Post a Copy of the Paris Edition of the Pamphlet I mention'd to you. I wish it were possible not to print an Edition in London, because the whole Affair will appear perfectly ridiculous to the English: But as I am afraid this is impossible, I believe it is better for me to take care, that a true Edition be printed. I committ that matter to your Care.

Contrary to my former Directions, I now desire you not to follow the Paris Edition in my Narrative; but exactly the English Copy which I sent you in Manuscript. There is only one Passage, where I desire a Sentence to be inserted: It is a little before the Copy of the King of Prussia's letter to Rousseau. I there say, ‘But I little expected, at the Distance of 150 Miles and employing myself constantly in his Service, to be the Victim of his Rage and Malevolence’. Add, ‘An Incident happened about this time, which set this Disposition of M. Rousseau in a full Light. There had been a feigned Letter of the King of Prussia's’, etc.

There is a very material Note, omitted by the Editors of the Paris Edition, which I desire you to insert. I send you a Copy of it, with Directions for inserting it. I suppose all along, that you have receivd the Paris Edition by this time: Otherwise I woud have sent it you.

 I am Dr Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.

Edinburgh 4 of Novr 1766.

P.S. I need not tell you that Rousseau's long Letter to me is to be translated from the Paris Edition with all the Notes. The other Letters may be translated indifferently either from that Edition or from my Manuscript.
