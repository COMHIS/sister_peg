Dear Sir

About six weeks ago, I gave our Friend, Jack Stuart, the Trouble of delivering you a Letter, & some papers enclos'd, which I was desirous to submit to your Criticism & Examination. I say not this by way of Compliment & Ceremonial, but seriously & in good earnest. It is pretty usual for People to be pleas'd with their own Performance, especially in the Heat of Composition; but I have scarcely wrote any thing more whimsical, or whose Merit I am more diffident of.

But in sending in these Papers, I am afraid that I have taken the least Step towards conveying them to your hand: I shou'd also have wrote you to ask for them, otherwise, perhaps, our Friend may wear them out in his Pocket, & forget the Delivery of them. Be so good, therefore, as to desire them from him, & having read them at your Leizure, return them to him in a Packet, and he will send them to me by the Carrier. You wou'd easily observe what I mention'd to you, that they had a Reference to some other Work, and were not complete in themselves. But, with this Allowance, are they tolerable?

I wrote a Letter to Mr Mure directed to your Care; but it wou'd come too late for him. Be pleas'd to send it to him, under a new Cover, without any other Direction than that of Member of Parliament at London. For that is sufficient.

I am Dear Sir Yours in [ ]
