My dear Hume

The great desire that several french Gentlemen of my acquaintance have of being known to You, which happiness I have promised to procure them, makes me ardently beg the favour of You to do me the honour to dine with me any day next week (Monday excepted) that You please to appoint. Your recountres with the men my dear friend gives me no sort of pain, but I freely own to You I am under some uneasiness how you will acquit Yourself with the fair sex whose impatience of knowing You is not to be expressed. The day You dine with me You will meet some folks who admire Your productions as much as any of Your own countrymen, and perhaps comprehend Your sublime Ideas as well as they do. I beg leave to assure You that no body loves and admires You more than Your Most sincere friend and humble Servant
