Dear Sir,

This letter will be deliver'd to you by M. Deyverdun, a Swiss gentleman, a man of letters and of merit, whom I had occasion to know particularly, because he was in the Secretary's office, and in Mr Conway's department. He has undertaken a work, of which he has publish'd only one number, under the title of Memoires literaires de la Grande Bretagne; and he has a second in hand. He wishes to enrich it by an account of Lord Herbert's Life; but not knowing where to find a copy, he uses the freedom, throâ€˜ my recommendation, to apply to you: I hope you will have no objection to the supplying him with one. I am, dear Sir,

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant

David Hume.
