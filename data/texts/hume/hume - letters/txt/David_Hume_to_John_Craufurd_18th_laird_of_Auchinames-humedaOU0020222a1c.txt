Edinburgh 21 of May 1770

Dear Crawford

I find, that you take the first word of fliting, that is of scolding, since I must interpret to you your mother tongue. I ought to abuse you for staying so little time here, for departing so abruptly, and for allowing yourself, even before I cou'd see you, to be so much pre-engaged in mixt Companies, and to have contracted for more dinners & suppers than you cou'd fulfill, even if you had stayed much longer. And yet you pretend to abuse me: I can only say in reply, very seriously and very sincerely, that no-one, either in this place or anywhere else, loves your company better; and I regret very much, that I am likely to have so little of it. I cou'd also wish that you had a prospect of your being happier in your absence, than your State of health seems to permit.

Davy Ross dined with me yesterday, who tells me, that your father is far from being well, and he does not think that he will be able to travel to Bath this Season.

I have made out my Letter to Monsr Francis. It is a strong proof of my Reluctance to writing, when I shoud protract answering the Letter of a Man, whose Company is so agreeable to me. Please deliver my Letter to the Ambassador, to whom I desire my Respects; as also in a particular manner to the Ambassadress.

 I am Dear Crawford 
Yours sincerely



David Hume
