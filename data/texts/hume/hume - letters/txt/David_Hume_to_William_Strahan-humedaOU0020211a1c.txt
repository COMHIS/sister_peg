Dear Sir

I thank you for the Copy of the Letter, which you sent me: It is a mark of the Intentions of the Ministry; but according to my small Judgement it wou'd be impolitic to attack the Faction by an arbitrary Punishment of these Addresses. There is something like a Precedent for it during the Reign of Charles the second, in the punishment inflicted by the House of Commons on the Abhorrers, but the House was then on the popular Side, when they may do any thing: And the Measures of that House of Commons carry less Authority with them, as they are at present condemnd by all sober People. The Ministry ought to wait with patience till some Violence or personal Insult be offerd to the Parliament, which will not be long, and will give Government great Advantages. I wish only the Army may be faithful, and the Militia quiet: Woud to God we had a Scotch Militia at present. This Country is almost unanimous.

I like extremely the Type and paper of your new Edition. I return the Sheet to you not to lose a set. If I ever see a new Edition of my History, I coud wish to see [it] in a like Size; that is, under Submission to you and the Proprietors who are much better Judges of these Matters. I am with great Sincerity

Dear Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
