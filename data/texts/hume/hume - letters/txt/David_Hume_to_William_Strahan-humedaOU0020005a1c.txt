Dear Strahan

Is it not strange that you and I have not yet met? I have been so hurry'd both with my own Affairs and with Monsr Rousseau's, that I can excuse myself: But I own that I hopd your Leizure woud allow you to come hither. I go out of town to morrow and Sunday: As soon as I come back I propose to beat up your Quarters. My Compliments to Mrs Strahan.

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.

Buckingham Street, York Buildings, Mrs Adams's. Friday [end of Jan. 1766].
