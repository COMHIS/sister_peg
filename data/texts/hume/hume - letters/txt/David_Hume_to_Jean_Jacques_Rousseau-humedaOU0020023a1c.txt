Mr Hume presents his Respects to Monsr Rousseau. He sends him Mr Malthus's Letter. He wishes Monsr Rousseau had asked Mr Malthus's Direction; but if Monsr Rousseau will be pleased to write an Answer, and deliver it to Mr Hume on Saturday, he will find means to convey it to Mr Malthus.

Mr Davenport has been with Mr Hume, and is very happy with the Prospect of receiving Monsr Rousseau at his Country House. He proposes to wait on Monsr Rousseau at Mr Ramsay's on Saturday. He is an elderly Man, of a considerable Fortune and a good Character. His Proposals appear to Mr Hume very inviting; and he hopes that they will appear so to Monsr Rousseau.

Mr Hume has had a long Letter from the President Malesherbes, which he will communicate to Monsr Rousseau at meeting.

Mr Stewart tells Mr Hume, that Monsr Rousseau's Trunk is arrived; tho' he has not yet been able to get it from the Customhouse. But Monsr Rousseau need have no anxiety on that head.

 Thursday evening [Feb. or March 1766.]
