Old-Windsor the 23d July 1766

After the letter you showed me, Sr and the account you gave me, when you was here, of that madman Rousseau nothing can surprise me from that quarter: but it does worse for it allarms me, his Frenzy is grown to such a height that I really think him dangerous, and that for his own sake and that of others 'tis full time he shou'd be locked up. Detestation for his malevolence, and compassion for his madness, make a sort of odd mixture in ones Sensations for him, and both prevent ones laughing at the ridiculous as well as absurd idea he has got about the conspiracy of the Triumvirate he supposes united to hurt him. You have really done by this Country, in importing him, what the late Lord Hillsborough did by Ireland, in carrying them the noxious animals and insects which were not the produce of that Country, and if Jean Jaques encreases and multiplys here you will have a great deal to answer for . . . .
