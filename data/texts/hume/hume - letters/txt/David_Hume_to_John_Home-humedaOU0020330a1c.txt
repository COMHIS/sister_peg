Edinburgh 6 August, 1776.

My dear John,

I shall begin with telling you the only piece of good news of the family, which is, that my nephew, in no more than two days that he has stayed here, has recovered so surprisingly, that he is scarcely knowable, or rather is perfectly knowable, for he was not so on his first arrival. Such are the advantages of youth! His uncle declines, if not with so great rapidity, yet pretty sensibly. Sunday, ill; half of yesterday the same; easy at present; prepared to suffer a little to-morrow; perhaps less the day after. Dr Black says, I shall not die of a dropsy, as I imagined, but of inanition and weakness. He cannot, however, fix, with any probability, the time, otherwise he would frankly tell me.

Poor Edmonstoune and I parted to-day, with a plentiful effusion of tears; all those Belzebubians have not hearts of iron. I hope you met with everything well at Foggo, and receive nothing but good news from Buxton. In spite of Dr Black's caution, I venture to foretell that I shall be yours cordially and sincerely till the month of October next,

David Hume.
