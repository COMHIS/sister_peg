Dear Sir

There have some Transactions pass'd with you of late, which much excite our Curiosity at a Distance; but I do not wish that you woud write me your Opinion freely about them, unless you can get a private hand, by whom you can send your Letter.

I shall be much obligd to you, if you will be so good as to insert the following Article in the Chronicle, and give it about to the other Papers.

‘Paris. On Tuesday the fourth of June, being the Anniversary of his Majesty's Birth day, the Earl of Hertford, Ambassador from England, invited all the English of Rank and Condition to this Place, to the Number of seventy Persons, who dind with him and celebrated that Solemnity. The Company appeard very splendid, being almost all drest in new and rich Cloaths on this Occasion; the Entertainment was magnificent, and the usual Healths were drunk with great Loyalty and Alacrity by all present.’

I am sorry it is not allowd me to communicate to you any more interesting Intelligence; but be assurd of my Regard, and excuse my abrupt Conclusion, as I write in a Hurry. I am Dear Sir Yours most sincerely

David Hume.

Paris 6th of June, 1765.
