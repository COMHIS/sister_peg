London Feb. 9. 1748.

Dear Sir,

The doubt and ambiguity with which I came hither was soon removed. General St Clair positively refused to accept of a Secretary from the Ministry; and I go along with him in the same station as before. Every body congratulates me upon the pleasure I am to reap from this jaunt: and really I have little to oppose to this prepossession, except an inward reluctance to leave my books, and leisure and retreat. However, I am glad to find this passion still so fresh and entire; and am sure, by its means, to pass my latter days happily and cheerfully, whatever fortune may attend me.

I leave here two works going on, a new edition of my Essays, all of which you have seen, except one, Of the Protestant Succession, where I treat that subject as coolly and indifferently, as I would the dispute betwixt Caesar and Pompey. The conclusion shows me a Whig, but a very sceptical one. Some people would frighten me with the consequences that may attend this candour, considering my present station; but I own I cannot apprehend any thing.

The other work is the Philosophical Essays, which you dissuaded me from printing. I won't justify the prudence of this step, any other way than by expressing my indifference about all the consequences that may follow. I will expect to hear from you; as you may from me. Remember me to Mrs Home, and believe me to be yours most sincerely,

David Hume.

P.S. We set out on Friday next for Harwich.
