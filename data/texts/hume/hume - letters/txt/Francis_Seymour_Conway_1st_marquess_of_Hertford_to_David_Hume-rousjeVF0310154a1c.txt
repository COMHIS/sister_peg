London Novr 12th 1766

Dear Sr

I have received the copy You ordered me of the printed dispute between yourself and Rousseau, as I have been at Paris You will not however imagine I waited till this time to see it, a paper which was in everybody's hands, and of which I have the satisfaction to tell You there was but one opinion, Rousseau is universally condemned; I was however surprized to find it in print after what You had told me but when I see the King again in private I will acquaint Him with your reasons. [. . .]

I remain Dear Sr with true regard

your ever faithful 
humble Servant 
Hertford.
