Sir,

I came in Friday & have the Satisfaction of finding Mr. Rous[s]eau in perfect health. He seems to like the place, amuses himself with walking when the weather is fair, if rainy he plays upon the harpsichord or writes — is very sociable & an excellent companion; pray remember your promise of Calling & of giving me as much notice as you Can. In about 10 days, I go to Davenport, Mr. R— stays here. Somehow be it at which house it chances. I beg leave to Assure you none will be more pleased to see Mr Hume than his Most Obedient

 Humble Servant:

Rich. Davenport
