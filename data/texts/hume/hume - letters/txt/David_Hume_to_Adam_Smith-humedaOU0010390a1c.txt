Dear Smith

To-day is the grand Question decided by our Judges, whether they will admit of any farther Proof with regard to the Douglas Affair, or whether they will rest contented with the Proofs already produc'd. Their Partiality is palpable and astonishing; yet few people think, that they will dare to refuse enquiring into Facts so remarkable and so strongly attested. They are at present sitting, but I hope to tell you the Issue in a Postscript. Our friend, Johnstone, has wrote the most-super-excellent-est Paper in the World, which he has promis'd to send to you this Evening in Franks. Please to deliver the enclosed to Colonel Barr√®. I am Dear Smith.

 Yours most sincerely

David Hume
