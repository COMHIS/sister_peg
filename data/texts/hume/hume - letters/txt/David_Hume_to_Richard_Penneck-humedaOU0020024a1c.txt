Lisle Street Leicester Fields Sunday Evening [? 2 March 1766]

Sir

I find, that Monr Rousseau is as yet undecided as to the place in which he will settle himself. Several (and I am of the Number) advise him to prefer your Neighbourhood in Surrey; and Mr Stewart tells me, that you have been so good as to offer him your good Offices. He has also a Friend very near you, Mr Malthus, who is desirous of doing him every kind of Service. Be so kind as to write to any Correspondent in that Country; and try whether you cou'd not find a Place, where he coud board at reasonable Rate, he and his Gouvernante: He wishes, that the Price cou'd be fixed for Bed, boarding, washing and firing; or for as many of these Circumstances as possible. As he is impatient to leave London, he wishes also to know, whether there be not a tolerable Inn, in the Neighbourhood, where he coud settle till he find a Place to his Mind. It is probable you know Mr Malthus's Direction. Be so good as to put it on the enclosd, and send it to the Post. He wishes to have your Answer as soon as you receive this, and also as soon as you hear from your Parish. I am

 Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant



David Hume

P.S.

Mr Rousseau lives at Chiswick; but be pleasd to direct your Letter to me in this Place.
