‘This Night Opposition produc'd a Motion to overwhelm Administration as they said; that no Officer, employ'd in collecting his Majestys Revenue should be allowd to vote in the Election of a Member of Parliament: Administration carry'd the Question 263 to 188, so administration has gained 35 since the last Division. At the same Moment the House of Lords divided 81 against 41. We look upon Opposition to be over.’

Pray when do you come over to us? Do not buy any Claret to me.
