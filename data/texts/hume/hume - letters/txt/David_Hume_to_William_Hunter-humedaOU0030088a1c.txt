Dear Sir

Immediatly upon receiving yours of the 21st of August, I waited on Dr Astruc, and left with him your Letters, together with a Card for myself. I expected everyday, before I left Paris, that he woud have return'd my Visit, when I might have had some Conversation with him on the Subject of your Letter. I delay's acknowleging your Favour, till I coud be able to inform you of something more particular on that head. But as I never had an Opportunity of seeing the Doctor, I am not able to say any thing farther, than to assure you, that your Letter was deliver'd to him.

All this Family are well; but some of us in great Distress for the Departure of Lord Beauchamp, which indeed we have, all of us, great reason to regreat. I am

 Dear Sir 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant
