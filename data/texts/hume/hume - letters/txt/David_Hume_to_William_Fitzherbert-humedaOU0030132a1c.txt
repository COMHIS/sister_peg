[London 4 Mar. 1766]

Sir,

I called on you this morning, in order to speak to you about poor Rousseau, who is still somewhat undetermined in his projects; I told him of the kind offer you made him, of which he retains a due sense; but when I told him that your sister lived in the house, he feared that he would constrain her, and he was very sorry that he could reap no advantage by your goodness. I then told him of Mr. Davenport's offer, which, as Mr. Garrick tells me, you mentioned to him. He seems to like it extremely, and I doubt not but he may accept of it, provided Mr. Davenport will accept of board. I hope he will be so indulgent as to comply with this caprice of my friend; and I would propose thirty pounds a year for board, firing, and washing. I mention this sum, because M. Rousseau can spare it, and it was mentioned as the board he should pay for himself and his governante, to a farmer in Wales. I shall only propose a few questions: â€” 1. Is there wood and hills about Mr. Davenport's house? 2. Cannot Mr. Rousseau, if he should afterwards think proper, find a means to boil a pot, and roast a piece of meat, in Mr. Davenport's house, so as to be perfectly at home? 3. Will M. Davenport, in that case, be so good as to accept of a small rent for an apartment; for this circumstance, I find, is necessary. 4. Can Mr. Rousseau set out presently and take possession of his habitation?

I should be glad, if by your means I could have a conversation with Mr. Davenport; and shall wait on him, at any time or place he shall please to appoint me.

 I am Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant,



David Hume.

At Miss Elliot's, in Lisle-street, Leicester-Fields, Tuesday afternoon.
