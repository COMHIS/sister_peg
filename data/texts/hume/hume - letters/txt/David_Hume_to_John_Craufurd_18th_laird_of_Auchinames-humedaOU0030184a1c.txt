Cirencester 29 of August 1768

Dear Crawfurd

The more I think, the more doubts I entertain concerning the Propriety of your writing at all to the Duke of Grafton, and the less reason I see of your throwing up your Office, in case the Answer be not favourable. His Grace passes for the most inflexible Man in the World; so that there are no hopes of his being influenc'd by any Letter[s.] And as his late Coldness towards you proceeds [more] from a Jealousy of Friendship than any thing else, it may rather be considerd as obliging, tho' unlucky. However, if you still persist in the Resolution, contrary to my Opinion, I beg to be informd before you put it [i]nto Execution: For I am fully perswaded my Friends will easily be able to procure it for me

I am here at a kind of classical Place, celebrated by Pope, Swift &c [a]nd with a classical Man, who livd in Intimacy with these two wits and with Prior, Gay, Arbuthnot, Bolingbroke & every Person celebrated in his time. Both the Place and the Man are very agreeable, and the Weather is fine; my Appettite good; the Table plentiful, and the Wine excellent. Nothing is wanting to make the time pass as cheerfully as possible. I leave this towards the End of the Week, and go to Ragley: I shall be in Town about three weeks hence, where I hope to find you.

 Yours sincerely

D. H.
