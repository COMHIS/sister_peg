[Portsmouth May or June, 1746]

. . . As to myself, my way of life is agreeable; and though it may not be so profitable, as I am told, yet so large an army as will be under the General's command in America, must certainly render my perquisites very considerable. I have been asked whether I would incline to enter the Service? My answer was, That at my years I could not decently accept of a lower commission than a company. The only prospect of working this point would be, to procure at first a company in an American regiment, by the choice of the Colonies. But this I build not on, nor indeed am I very fond of it.

I like exceedingly your method of explaining personal identity, as being more satisfactory than any thing that had ever occurred to me. As to the idea of substance, I must own, that as it has no access to the mind by any of our senses or feelings, it has always appeared to me to be nothing but an imaginary centre of union amongst the different and variable qualities that are to be found in every piece of matter. But I shall keep myself in suspense till I hear your opinion. Adieu my dear friend. D. H.
