Sir

I am very much oblig'd to you for your Remarks, & think them all just except one, of which I have some doubt. I believe occur is good English, in the Sense, in which I have us'd it. Ainsworth, who is a good Authority, so far as he goes, translates it, in mentem venire. You will oblige me much by continuing. I have already alterd all the Passages, which you have pointed out. I am Sir

 Your most obedient Servant

David Hume.
