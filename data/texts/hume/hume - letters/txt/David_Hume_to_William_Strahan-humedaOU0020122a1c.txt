Dear Sir

I was sorry not to be at home, when you did me the Favour to call on me the other day: My Occupations prevent my calling on you: But if you be any day at this End of the Town, the best way is to call on me at Mr Conway's House, where I am every forenoon, and commonly between 10 and 3: It is in Little Warwick Street: You'll do me a Pleasure in allowing me at any time half an hour's Conversation with you.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.

 Friday Forenoon [? February 1767.]
