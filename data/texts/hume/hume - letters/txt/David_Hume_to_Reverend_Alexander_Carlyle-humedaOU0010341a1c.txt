Dear Sir

I am inform'd, that you have receiv'd a Letter from London, by which you learn that the Manuscript of Sister Peg has been trac'd to the Printer's, and has been found to be in many Places interlind & corrected in my hand-writing. I cou'd have wish'd, that you had not publishd this Piece of Intelligence before you told me of it. The Truth is, after I had compos'd that trifling Performance, and thought I had made it as correct as I cou'd, I gave it to a sure hand to be transcribed, that, and in case any of the London Printers had known my hand, they might not be able to discover me: But as it lay by me some Weeks afterwards, I coud not forbear reviewing it; and not having my Amanuensis at hand, I was oblig'd in several Places to correct it myself, rather than allow it to go to the Press [with] Inaccuracies of which I was sensible. I little dream'd, that this small Want of Precaution [wou'd have] betray'd me so soon! But as you know, that I am very indifferent about Princes or Preside[nts, Minist] ers of the Gospel or Ministers of State, Kings or Keysars, and set at Defiance all Powers, hum[an and] infernal; I had no other Reason for concealing myself but in order to try the Taste of the Public, whom, tho I also set in some degree at Defiance, I cannot sometimes forbear paying a little regard to. I find, that that frivolous Composition has been better receivd than I had any Reason to expect; and therefore cannot much complain of the Injury you have done me by revealing my Secret, and obliging me to acknowlege it more early than I intended. The only Reason of my writing to you is to know the Printer's Name who has so far broke his Engagements as to show the Manuscript: For the Bookseller assurd my Friend, to whom I entrusted it, that we might depend upon an absolute Secrecy. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Carlisle. And am Dr Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant
