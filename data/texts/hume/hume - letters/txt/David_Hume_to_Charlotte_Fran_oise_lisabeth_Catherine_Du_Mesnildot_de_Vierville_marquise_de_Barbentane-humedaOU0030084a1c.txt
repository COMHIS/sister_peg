[Paris 8 June 1764]

I flatter myself, Madam, that I have found a sure and a safe Opportunity of commissioning from London the Books, which you did me the Honour to mention to me: But before I can do it with the requisite Exactness, I believe, that it will be necessary for me to see Monsr Du Pons. If you desire, therefore, that the Books shou'd be commissioned soon, you must be so good as to make that Gentleman allow me an Interview with him: If you be in no Hurry, we may delay it till I meet him at Compiegne. I have been this Evening to pay my Respects to you, and to wish you a good Journey.

And I have the Honour to be with the greatest Regard Madam 
Your most obedient humble Servant

Lord Hertford goes to Compiegne the 25th or 26th of the Month, and I accompany him thither.
