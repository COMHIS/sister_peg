Dear Sir

I am sorry to tell you, that, by my last Accounts from Mr Turgot, he finds, that the Court of Parma are resolved to have a Catholic for a Professor, which is a Circumstance, as I have told him, very difficult to be obtain'd. I hope the Dissappointment gives you no Uneasyness. The Course of Studies, into which the Proposal has led you, will not be disagreeable, nor in any respects a Loss to you; and you have too much Prudence to set your Heart upon an Uncertainty. I did indeed think, that the Scheme woud have suited you very well, both in respect of Talents and Inclination.

 I am with great Sincerity Dear Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
