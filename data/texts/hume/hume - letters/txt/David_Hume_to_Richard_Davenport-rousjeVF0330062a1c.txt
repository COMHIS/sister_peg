London, 16th of May 1767.

Dear Sir:

You are probably told by Mr. Fitzherbert that your wild philosopher, as you call him, has at last appeared at Spalding in Lincolnshire, whence he has wrote a most extravagant letter to the chancellor, demanding a messenger to conduct him safely to Dover for which, he says, there is an absolute necessity; and this act of hospitality he desires as the last from a country which he seems determined to abandon forever. In short, he is plainly mad, after having been long maddish; and your good offices, with those of Mr. Conway, not to mention mine, being joined to the total want of persecution in this country, have pushed him beyond all bounds of patience. I know [not] what to advise you with regard to his baggage and his money; he will probably pass by London in his way to Dover, and you may give any of your friends here what orders you think proper on that head. I suppose he gives up his pension forever. The Lord have mercy on him! as you say.

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant,

David Hume
