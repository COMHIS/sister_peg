Edinburgh 21 January, 1752

Sir

The part which you have acted in the late project for my election into your College, gave me so much pleasure, that I should do myself the greatest violence did I not take every opportunity of expressing my most lively sense of it. We have failed, and are thereby deprived of great opportunities of cultivating that friendship which had so happily commenced by your zeal for my interests; but I hope other opportunities will offer; and I assure you, that nothing will give me greater pleasure than an intimacy with a person of your merit. You must even allow me to count upon the same privilege of friendship, as if I had enjoyed the happiness of a longer correspondence and familiarity with you. For as it is a common observation, that the conferring favours on another is the surest method of attaching us to him, I must by this rule consider you as a person to whom my interests can never be altogether indifferent. Whatever the reverend gentlemen may say of my religion, I hope I have as much morality as to retain a grateful sentiment of your favours, and as much sense as to know whose friendship will give greatest honour and advantage to me.

I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, 
David Hume
