Dr Sir

If you pass by Edinburgh, please bring me two Pounds of Rapee, such as Peggy Elliot uses to take. You will get it at Gillespy's, near the Cross.

Mrs Mallet has her Compliments to you, & begs you to procure her a Collection of Scotch Pebles. I assurd her that I shoud inform you of her Desire, & also that you woud not fail to execute it.

We hear that you are to be expelld the University with Disgrace. Even the most partial of your Friends here, are obligd to allow that you deserve it.

We expect over forty thousand French with the first fair Wind. They will probably settle the Ministry. For at present the Pits & the Legs & the Grenvilles are all going by the Ears.

We live in hopes of seeing you soon. My Compliments to Smith, whose Book is in a very good way.

Dr Warburton presents his Compliments to you

 Yours sincerely

Da. Hume
