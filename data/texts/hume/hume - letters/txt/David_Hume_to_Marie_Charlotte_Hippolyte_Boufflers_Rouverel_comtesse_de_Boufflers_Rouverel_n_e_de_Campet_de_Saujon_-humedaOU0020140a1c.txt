London 22 May, 1767.

Madam,

I find you are desirous to hear no more of me, which, I own, is one of the greatest surprizes, and none of the least afflictions I have met with in the course of my life. However, I could not forbear writing to you, because I shall put it in your power to do an act of generosity, which, unless you be, indeed, totally changed in every respect, must give you pleasure....

It is evident, from all these contrarieties and extravagances, that he is quite disordered in his judgment; yet are his letters, particularly that to Mr Conway, still wrote with beauty and elegance. He laments his being alive, and regrets his being obliged to leave England, but says that he finds every body prepossessed against him; for what reason he cannot imagine, unless it be on account of his conduct towards me, in which he owns he may be to blame. He accepts, however, with gratitude the King's pension; and says he will again write to the General from Calais. He is not in his Armenian dress, so that he may perhaps pass unnoticed: but if he be discovered, as is more probable, there is nothing he has not to dread from the violence of the Parliament; and little relief can be expected from the good will of the ministers towards him. I thought it proper to inform you, that if you hear of his being discovered and arrested, you may employ your credit in restoring him to his liberty, by representing him in his true colours, as a real and complete madman, who is an object of compassion, and can be dangerous to nobody. I find myself much inclined to say a great deal more to you about other subjects, but much check my inclination; and therefore desire only my compliments to Madame de Vierville and Madame de Barbantane, and to Miss Becket; and am

 Madam, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant,



David Hume.
