[. . .] I will tell yo honestly that I was much hurt yesterday wt yours to Mr Strahan, w₶ he showed me when in Town, about his, Messrs Beckett or Cadell's being imployed by you in Publishing this absurd Dispute of Rousseau wt yo, as yo imagined it would not be worth my while. Can you imagine any thing however so trifling in w₶ yr name is concerned, not worth my while? surely I never did.  Dr. Lowth thought differently in a more delicate affair and even  or less in point of value. In truth the money w₶ will be got I do not value, but in the eye of the world where I have so cordial a friendship, to see other names and not mine looks as though yo were offended. [. . .] Strahan and Beckett divide the Spoil unless yo interpose. It is a painfull thing to loose a favourite. I leave it to yr own Judgement to act as yo see fit. I think it wd be no disadvantage to  you to have my name and Mr Cadells.

If I had ever dreamed of this Publication, I shd have wrote to yo but indeed I did not. [. . .]
