[Edinburgh early 1755]Â 

Madam

I esteem myself extremely oblig'd to you for sending me a Copy of the Earl of Darby's Letter to Ireton which is certainly a very curious Piece, and shows a very undaunted Spirit and great Resolution. But tho' the Earl was remarkable for Courage, I find that his Countess was still more memorable. After her Husband lost his head, she still kept out the Isle of Man, & was the last Person in all the three Kingdoms who submitted to the Parliament. In my History of the Commonwealth I have endeavor'd to do Justice to her Merit.

I assure you, Madam, that I am very proud of your Approbation of that Volume, which I have publish'd. I am sensible, that I merit that Honour only by my Endeavors to be candid and disinterested. I wish you had been here to defend me against my Enemies. They throw on me even the Reproach of Papist; an Imputation, which I never imagin'd I shoud have merited. From accusing me of believing nothing, they now charge me with believing every thing. I hope you will be perswaded, that the Truth lyes in the middle betwixt these Accusations.

I beg my humble Respects to Lady Ross and to Miss Betty; and I beg you to believe, that I have the Honour to be, with great Sincerity, Madam

 Your Ladyship's most obedient and most humble Servant

David Hume
