Dear Dr

I go in a few hours to Woburn; so can only give you the Outline of my History. Thro many Difficulties I obtain'd a Pension for Rousseau. The Application was made with his own Consent & Knowlege. I write him, that all is happily compleated, and he needs only draw for the Money. He answers me, that I am a Rogue and a Rascal; and have brought him into England, merely to dishonour him. I demand the Reason of this strange Language; and Mr Davenport, the Gentleman with whom he lives, tells him, that he must necessarily satisfy me. To day, I receiv'd a Letter from him, which is perfect Frenzy: It woud make a good eighteen-penny Pamphlet; and I fancy he intends to publish it. He there tells me, that D'Alembert, Horace Walpole and I had from the first enterd into a Combination to ruin him; and had ruin'd him: That the first Suspicion of my Treachery arose in him, while we lay together in the same Room of an Inn in France: I there spoke in my Sleep and betray'd my Intention of ruining him: That young Troncin lodg'd in the same House with me at London; and Annie Elliot lookd very coldly at him as he went by her in the Passage: That I am also in a close Confederacy with Lord Lyttleton, who he hears is his mortal Enemy: That the English Nation were very fond of him on his first Arrival; but that Horace Walpole & I had totally alienated them from him. He owns, however, that his Belief of my Treachery went no higher than Suspicion while he was in London; but it rose to Certainty after he arrivd in the Country: For that there were several Publications in the Papers against him, which coud have proceeded from no body but me or my Confederate Horace Walpole. The rest is all of a like Strain, intermix'd with many Lyes and much Malice. I own, that I was very anxious about this Affair but this Letter has totally reliev'd me. I write in a hurry, merely to satisfy your Curiosity. I hope soon to see you; and am Dear Sir

 Yours most sincerely
