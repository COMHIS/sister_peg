Dear Sir

I am favour'd with yours of the 6th Instant; but not a Word from Rousseau, nor indeed do I expect to hear from him. I see, that this whole Affair is a Complication of Wickedness and Madness; and you may believe, I repent heartily, that I ever had any Connexions with so pernicious and dangerous a Man. He has evidently been all along courting, from Ostentation, an Opportunity of refusing a Pension from the King, and at the same time, of picking a Quarrel with me, in order to cancel at once all his past Obligations to me. The worst is, that I am detain'd in Town by this foolish Affair, to which there is no Prospect of an Issue. For as it is utterly impossible for him, even by the utmost License of Lying, in which he seems very little scrupulous, to give the smallest and most distant Reason for his Quarrel, I presume he will never write me at all. Cou'd I therefore encroach so far on your Goodness as to desire you, if you think proper, to suggest to him, that I am impatient to have an Answer. I also repeat my Request to have, if possible, Copies of all my Letters to him since he left London. I cannot sufficiently express my Satisfaction in your Conduct, and my Vexation at the Uneasiness this Affair must have given you.

 I am Dear Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
