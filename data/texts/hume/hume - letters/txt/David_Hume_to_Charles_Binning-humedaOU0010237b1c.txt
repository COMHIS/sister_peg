Sir

A few days ago I sent the Faculty a verbal Resignation; but as I am told, that it is expected I shou'd give a Resignation under my hand, and as I am very desirous to deliver over the Charge of the Library as soon as possible, I have been induc'd to write you at present, and beg of you to inform the Faculty, that they may choose me a Successor, whenever they think proper I am

Sir 
Your most humble Servant, 
David Hume.
