Dear Sir

All the Discoveries I made in K. James's Memoirs make against himself and his Brother; and he is surely a good enough Witness on that Side: But I believe him also a man of Veracity, and I shoud have put Trust in any Matter of Fact, that he told from his own Knowlege. But this it is needless for us to talk any more about; since I suppose you have got Copies enough of my History already printed to last for your Lifetime and mine. I shall certainly never think of adding another Line to it. I am too much your Friend to think of it.

I am much vexd at that dear and rare Edition of Coke's Institutes which you sent me. I must either pay you the half of it from my own Pocket or send it back to you. I never desird any other than a common & ordinary Edition of a common Book: This amounts to a sum not easily commanded by a French Lawyer.

If you be sending any Cargos of Books to Paris, I wish you woud send in Sheets half a dozen Copies of the new Edition of my Essays. I beg my sincere Compliments to Mrs Millar. I saw a few days ago Mrs Mallet, who seems to be going upon a strange Project of living alone in a Hermitage, in the midst of the Forrest of Fontainebleau. I pass my time very agreeably here; tho' somewhat too much dissipated for one of my Years & Humour.

 I am Dear Sir 
Yours Sincerely



David Hume.
