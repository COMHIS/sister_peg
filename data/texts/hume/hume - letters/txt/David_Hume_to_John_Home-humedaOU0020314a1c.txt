Edinburgh April 12 1776

Dear John

The loss which both of us, and I in particular, have sustained is irreparable. The Baron was the oldest and best friend I had in the World. I should be inconsolable did I not see an Event approaching, which reduces every thing to a Level.

Our news is that Lord George Germaine has given that Office to his own Son. I wish this News may not prove too true.

I never had thoughts of being in London. Dr Black (God bless him) tells me that nothing is so improper for me as leaving my own house, jolting about on the Road, lying in inconvenient Inns, and being disordered in my Diet; and that I shall dye with much greater tranquillity in St. David's Street than any where else. Besides where can I expect spiritual Assistance so consolatory as from Dr Blair & Dr Robertson? Not to mention a casual Exhortation from Carlysle or from you. Even Mr Ferguson might be called on difficult emergencies.

When are you to be down? Bring Smith with you.

 Yours

David Hume.
