Sir,

You seem uneasy that all my letters have been open'd, and so am I too; but, as I think I have in all of them us'd the precaution to name no-body, and to date from no place, and even not to subscribe the letters, it can be of no consequence, and can only proceed from the universal practice of opening all letters at present; though none of mine ever came to me in that manner. A clerk in the post-office opens a letter, runs it over, and, finding it concerns only private business, forwards it presently, and thinks no farther of the matter: so that, what one writes of that kind, seems to me as safe as what one says. However, as you appear to think otherwise, I shall be more cautious for the future. The unexpected vexations I met with (which I hope will now soon have an end, some way or other) made me glad, on every occurrence, to open my mind to you, and my great leizure gave me full opportunity. This is my reason, or at least my excuse, for troubling you so frequently.

Your friend still keeps his health and temper to admiration. I am, Sir, with great regard, your most obedient humble Servant,

Da. Hume.

 Wednesday.
