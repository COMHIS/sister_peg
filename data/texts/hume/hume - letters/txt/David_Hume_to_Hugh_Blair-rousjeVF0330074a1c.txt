[. . .] You may perhaps have heard, that Rousseau has elop'd from Mr Davenport without giving any Warning; leaving all his Baggage except Mdlle, about thirty pounds in Davenport's hands, and a Letter on the Table abusing him in the most violent Terms, insinuating that he was in a Conspiracy with me to ruin him. He took the Road to London; but was missing for about a Fortnight: At last he emerges at Spalding in Lincolnshire; whence he writes a Letter to the Chancellor, informing him that the bad Usage he had met with in England made it absolutely necessary for him to evacuate the Kingdom, and desiring his Lordship to send him a Guard to escort him in Safety to Dover; this being the last Act of Hospitality, he will desire of the Nation. He is plainly mad; tho I believe not more so, than he has been all his Life. The Pamphlet you mention was wrote by one as mad as himself, and it was believd at first to be Tristram Shandy, but proves to be one Fuseli, an Engraver. He is a fanatical Admirer of Rousseau, but owns he was in the wrong to me. The Pamphlet I sent you was wrote by an English Clergyman whom I never saw; a man of Character, and rising in the Church: For which Reason, it is more prudent in me to conceal his Name. When woud you have done so much for me? [. . .]

I am Dear Sir

Yours sincerely
