[. . .] And in a Letter I had a few days ago from MacClaine at the Hague ye Editor and Translator of Mosheim, who has heard the Story of Rousseau and you, after a good deal adds — 'Everybody, however, except a few foaming partisans of Rousseau, is persuaded that Mr Hume has been ill repaid for his generosity and freindship, and hisknown humanity and social merit from presumptions even in his favour even amongst those, who are not acquainted with the true State of the dispute. For my own part I am of this way of thinking, tho' at the same time, I cannot say it was highly prudent in Mr Hume to bring with him such an Ouran-Outang into England, unless he proposed sending him to graze in the Mountains of Wales, where he might have gone upon all-fours, eat grass, drink of the limpid fountain, shunned the sweets and duties of social life, and thus enjoyed the natural state of man in all its savage perfection. I know a great deal of Rousseau, and I know particularly that his Stoical (I had allmost said his Cynical) Pride, covers and covers but ill, a very mortifying degree of human infirmity. I wish you would let me know ye particular circumstances relative to the Pension & what drew on Mr Hume his Invectives'.

Pray what shall I write to him? [. . .]

I truly am
