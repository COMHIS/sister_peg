Dear Mich.

There has no Correspondence past betwixt us, for some weeks past, John having alwise occasion to write to you, about some Business or other. I cannot think it was upon this Account, & for want of an Invitation that you have taken a Resolution to go to Lawers this Vacance contrary to a kind of promise you made me of coming here. Perhaps you was afraid, that you would have no Conveniency in this little House, or that you would disturb us. For my Share, the State of my Health is such, & Indolence makes such Progress o'er me for want of being resisted, that wtout the least Scruple, I shall give you my room, & be contented to share one with John. This I can assure you, will be no manner of Loss to me, & I hope it will make you as easy as you cou'd wish. At Lawers I can never conceive, you can live to your Satisfaction, or according to the Projects you have form'd. I wish however you had informd me of your Designs and the State of your Health. For my Share I have so little confortable in these respects to tell you, that I believe it will be no Pleasure to you to hear it. But I hope you are in a contrary Case. Bring out with you or send with the Carrier Pelisson's History, & the last Volume of Rapin. I am afraid James Home come shortly to the countrey, & then I would be obligd to restore him his Book.

By Nephew & your Godson arrivd here safely from Dudiston where I am afraid it has been but very indifferently guided.

July 30 Michael Ramsay Esq. to be left at Mr Davidson Wigmaker's house in the first Story of Smith's Land. Edinr.
