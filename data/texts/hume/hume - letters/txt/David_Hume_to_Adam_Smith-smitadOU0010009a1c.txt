Edinburgh, Jack's Land, 26 May 1753

My Dear Sir

I was very sorry to hear by Mr Leechman that you had been ill of late. I am afraid the Fatigues of your Class have exhausted you too much, and that you require more Leizure and Rest than you allow yourself. However, the good Season and the Vacation now approaches; and I hope you intend, both for Exercise and Relaxation, to take a Jaunt to this Place. I have many things to communicate to you. Were you not my Friend, you wou'd envy my robust Constitution. My Application has been and is continual; and yet I preserve entire Health. I am now beginning the Long Parliament; which, considering the great Number of Volumes I peruse, and my scrupulous method of composing, I regard as a very great Advance I think you shou'd settle in this Town during the Vacation; where there always is some good Company; and you know, that I can supply you with Books, as much as you please.

I beg to hear from you at your Leizure; and am 
Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant 
David Hume
