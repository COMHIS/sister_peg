Fontainebleau 13 of October 1765

Sir

When I came to Fontainebleau, which was on Friday the 11th Instant, I thought, that I shoud have obtain'd a full and categorical Answer, with regard to the Paper of Canada. But the Duke of Praslin told me to day, that the Offices, to which that Matter was refer'd, cou'd not have their Reply ready, till the End of this Week; and as M. de Guerchy wou'd set out soon after, it was propos'd to give him full Powers and Instructions to settle finally that Dispute, which had been drawn out to such a Length of Negotiation.

M. de Praslin complain'd to me of an English Sloop that had enter'd the Harbour of St Pierre's, and had fird upon the Houses. He said, that the Governor of St Pierre's, had complaind to Capt. Paliser of this Outrage; but it was not known what Answer he had receivd.

The Duke also complaind to me, in the strongest Terms, of the Insolence, as he term'd it, of some Expressions in Capt. Paliser's Letters to the Governor of St. Pierre. The Duke of Choiseul enterd the Room, while M de Praslin was engag'd on this Subject. He repeated to me the same Complaint, with still greater Warmth. Both these Ministers told me, that M. de Blosset was instructed to lay these Complaints before your Excellency.

The Dauphin seems to be a little recover'd, since his Arrival at Fontainebleau. I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard, Sir

 Your Excellency's most obedient & most humble Servant

David Hume
