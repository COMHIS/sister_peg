Sir,

I have little more to say to you than that your friend continues still in good health and good humour. I informed you of his recovery by a letter dated on Tuesday last, which I sent in the common way, and which I find has not reacht you in the course of post. I shall put this into the post-house myself. 'Tis remarkable, that four days is just the time requisite for a letter to go to town, to come back hither, and to return again to town. If the same difference happen with regard to this letter and the last, it will amount to a demonstration. Good God!!! I only wish these letters had not been directed to you; for, as to their being seen, it is not, in my opinion, a farthing's matter.

I believe I shall be in town on Monday or Tuesday, when I shall pay my respects to you. I am, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,

Da. Hume.
