Dear Sir

I told you, that I intended to apply to the Faculty for Redress; and if refusd, to throw up the Library. I was assur'd that two of the Curators intended before the Faculty to declare their Willingness to redress me, after which there cou'd be no Difficulty to gain a Victory over the other two. But before the day came, the Dean prevaild on them to change their Resolution, & joind them himself with all his Interest. I saw it then impossible to succeed, & accordingly retracted my Application: But being equally unwilling to lose the Use of the Books & to bear an Indignity; I retain the Office, but have given Blacklock, our blind Poet, a Bond of Annuity for the Sallary. I have now put it out of these malicious Fellows power to offer me any Indignity; while my Motives for remaining in this Office are so apparent. I shou'd be glad that you approve of my Conduct: I own I am satisfy'd with myself.

Pray tell me, & tell me ingenuously, What Success has my History met with among the Judges with you, I mean Dr Cullen, Mr Betham, Mrs Betham, Mr Leechman, Mr Muirhead, Mr Crawford, &c? Dare I presume, that it has been thought worthy of Examination, & that its Beauties are found to overballance its Defects? I am very desirous to know my Errors, & I dare swear you think me tolerably docile, to be so veterane an Author. I cannot indeed hope soon to have an Opportunity of correcting my Errors; this Impression is so very numerous. The Sale indeed has been very great in Edinburgh; but how it goes on at London, we have not been precisely inform'd. In all Cases, I am desirous of storing up Instruction, & as you are now idle (I mean, have nothing but your Class to teach: Which to you is comparative Idleness) I will insist upon hearing from you.

Pray tell Mr Crawford, that I sent a Copy to Lord Cathcart, as he desird.

 I am Dear Sir 
Yours sincerely



David Hume.
