Sir,

Tho' I had business which requir'd my being in town, I rather chose to send the chaise empty, in order to give Mr Vincent an opportunity of coming out along with you, that the subject of our dispute may be discusst before all parties. I have told my Lord of your coming, and, at the same time, told him that we intended to reason the matter concerning which he is so earnest, and that we shou'd have more freedom if we were left together some time. He easily understood my meaning, and will not be surpriz'd if he see you and Mr Vincent and I retire from him a little.

Mr Vincent and I have always talkt on this subject without an indecent, or even without a passionate expression, at least on my part; and as we have agreed to write down our reasons separately, this will keep us to more method and order. I am, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume.

 Friday.

P.S. My Lord is very well at present.
