Dear Sir

I was sorry I did not see you before you left this Place. But I cou'd not possibly call on you in the Evening of Tuesday; and you was abroad in the Forenoon when I calld.

We are still in as unsettled a Condition as when you left us: There will certainly be a considerable Alteration in the Ministry; and I do not at present reckon my Principal's Situation more precarious than that of any other Minister. He speaks, however, like a Man who is to be out of Office in a few days. I have also taken the Precaution to desire him to request of the King in my Name the Liberty, after my Dismission, of inspecting all the public Records and all the Papers in the Paper-Office: His Majesty was pleasd to say that he very willingly comply'd with my Request, and was glad to hear of my Intentions. But my chief View is to run over such Papers as belong to the Period which I have already wrote, in order to render that part of my History as little imperfect as possible. It woud be folly to think of writing any more; and even as to correcting, were it not an Amusement, to what purpose woud it serve; since I shall certainly never live to see a new Edition? I beg my Compliments to Mrs Millar: I hope the Waters agree with all of you. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant
