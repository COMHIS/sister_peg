My dear Sir

Mr Elliot told me the affair you recomended to him. Since his arrival I have tryed every Farmer in our side of the country, and can find no proper place. Some have not room, some hate Foreigners, some don't chuse Boarders, and the major part of all are such beings as he could not live with in any comfortable manner. There's an old Frenchman who has been here since a Child, and has a sort of garden Farm at Fulham. To him I proposed the thing without mentioning names, and to oblige me he will take such a Boarder, but still I could wish to find a place where he would be more agreeably situated, for this man keeps only a single maid, eats very plain, and his house is as dirty as a Frenchman's in France. The Farmer himself is about sixty years old, unmarried, a chearful honest creature, of a very obliging disposition.

Consider whether this will sute your purpose, or if I should try in other countys. Adieu, my worthy good sir. Believe me eternally

your devoted servant 
J. Stewart
