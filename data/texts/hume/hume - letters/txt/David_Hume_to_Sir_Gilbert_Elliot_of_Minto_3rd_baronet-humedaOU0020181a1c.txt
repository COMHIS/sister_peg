Dear Sir Gilbert

I beg of you to direct the enclosed to poor Liston, who will be disappointed in the Scheme for Parma: They will have nothing but a Papist. Such Fools! Let the Pope excommunicate them on the one hand: I will do so on the other.

I have seen a Book newly printed at Edinburgh, calld Philosophical Essays. It has no manner of Sense in it; but is wrote with tolerable Neatness of Style: Whence I conjecture it to be our Friend, Sir David's. I am obligd to him for the Treatment which he destines me, to be lock'd up for five Years in a Dungeon, then to be hangd, and my Carcass to be thrown out of Scotland. He supports himself, indeed, by the Authority of Plato, whom I own to be truly divine. Pray, have you seen the Book? Is it Sir David's? I think it has not so many Attempts at Humour, as that pious Gentleman woud employ.

We are all very quiet here, as quiet as you at Minto, thoâ€˜ perhaps not so busy: No more noise of Wilkes and Liberty. Lord Mansfield said to me, that it was impossible for him to condemn him to the Pillory, because the Attorney-General did not demand it. Yesterday he represented to the Spanish Ambassador that moderate Sentence, as a Refinement in Politics, which reduc'd the Scoundrel the sooner to Obscurity. It woud be a strange Cause, which he coud not find plausible Reasons to justify.

I beg to be rememberd to Lady Elliot, and to any of your Family who may be at Minto. I ever am Dear Sir Gilbert

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.
