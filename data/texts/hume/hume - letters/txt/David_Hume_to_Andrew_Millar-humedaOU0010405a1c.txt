Dear Sir

I send you enclosd my Letter to Algaroti, which has been too long deferrd, & which you will be so good as to transmit to his Friend, Mr Hollis.

I returnd Burns eclesiastical Law two or three Days after you sent it me. At least my Man affirms he deliverd it into your Shop, and I fancy you will find upon Enquiry it is there.

I have been oblig'd to Mr Strange for a Present of all his Prints. He is a very worthy Man whom I value much; and therefore I desire you would send him a Copy of this new Edition of my History in Boards. His Wife lives in Castle Street.

My Copy has already gone to Paris: But I shall desire you to send me four or five Copies more to that Place, and shall write you Directions to that Purpose. I desire my Compliments to Mrs Millar with great Sincerity; and am

 Yours

D. H.

 8 Octr 1763

After my Departure, my Direction is under Cover to Lord Hertford at Northumberland House in the Strand London. All Letters so directed will be sent to us.
