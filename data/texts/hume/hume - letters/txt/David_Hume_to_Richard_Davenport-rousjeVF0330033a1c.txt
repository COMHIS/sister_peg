London, 27th of April 1767

Dear Sir:

The affair of M. Rousseau's pension is now finally concluded. I had to day a letter from Mr. Bradshaw of the treasury, informing me that the Duke of Grafton was instantly to order a hundred pounds a year to be paid, without deductions, to any person whom he should order to receive it. It is to commence from the first of this month, and will, I suppose, be paid quarterly. He has nothing to do but write a common missive to any person, banker or other, empowering him to receive payment as often as it becomes due.

Have you seen a little book, published within these few days, being an account of Rousseau's writings and conduct? It is a high panegyric on him; but without attempting to throw any blame upon me: on the contrary, it owns he was in the wrong in his quarrel with me. It is said to be the work of Dr. Sterne; but it exceeds even the usual extravagance of that gentleman's productions.

Lord Holderness told me that he intends to send a person across the country in order to take a view of your plough and its operations; I doubt not but you will give him a good reception.

I am dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant

David Hume.
