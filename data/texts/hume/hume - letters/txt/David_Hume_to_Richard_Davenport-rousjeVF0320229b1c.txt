Dear Sir

I find the Affair of Rousseau's Pension is quite finish'd, all except the formal Part, which I wou'd instantly sollicit, did not General Conway think, that you had better inform him previously of the Matter, lest some new Caprice shou'd seize him and lead him to reject anew His Majesty's Bounty. After he has notify'd to you or to General Conway his Acceptance, it will be easy in a day or two to have the Warrant pass'd at the Treasury.

I am Dr Sir

Your most obedient humble 
Servant 
David Hume
