Dear Sir

I have a Commission from a Gentleman here to send him over my History and other Writings in the Octavo Edition: Also Cay's Abridgement of the Statutes and Coke's Institutes: With a book call'd Le Glaneur d'histoire naturelle par George Edward en trois volume  Quarto. It is sold by Nourse & Dodesley, and is a Continuation of a Work publishd in two Volumes Quarto. You may add a Copy of John Home's Douglas and of this new Book, burnd by Order of the House of Commons. I shall take care that you be pay'd this Account: You will easily find a Method of conveying these Books to me. By some surprizing Negligence in Mr Stuart I have never yet got the Copies I wrote for of my History.

I should be glad to know how your new Method of publishing Volume by Volume has succeeded; and in general how the Sale has gone on this Winter; and what Share of the Edition is disposd of. I have liv'd such a Life of Dissipation as not to be able to think of any serious Occupation: But I begin to tire of that Course of Life. I have however run over K. James's Memoirs, and have pickd up some curious Passages; which it is needless to speak of, till we have Occasion for a new Edition, which I suppose is very distant. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Millar, whom I advise to take a Journey to Paris. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient Servant
