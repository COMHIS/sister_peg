Dear Sir

A most severe indisposition, of which I am but just recovering, did not permit me  to wait on you, upon your return in town.  I longed to have some conversation with you on the subject of the papers, which were remitted to me by the hands of Mr Ramsay, and as our Trustees did not think proper to receive them, to restore them into yours. With respect to these papers, give me leave to assure you, that I had never any doubt about the merits of the cause. I have long ago fixed my opinion about R . . . character, and think madness is the only excuse that can be offered for his inconsistencies, and that no body was ever less intitled to pass for a philosopher. His conduct towards you his friend and his benefactor is as unjustifiable as his suspicions were vain and ill grounded. At the same time I could have wished you had not been put under a necessity of publishing any thing of what passed between you, and own myself in that, of the same opinion with Mr. W. However you have the pleasure of finding the most sensible and honest part of mankind, nay the great majority likewise which is not always the case, unanimous in their judgement in your favor, and this is a sufficient compensation for the idle outcries and contradictions you must have expected, and could not fail experiencing. [. . .]

I am with the highest regard and esteem

Dear Sir 
Your Most Obedient 
Humble Servant 
M. Maty
