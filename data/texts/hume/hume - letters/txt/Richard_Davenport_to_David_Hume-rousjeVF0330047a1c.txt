Dear Sir

I received the fu[r]ther favour of yours last post, but at present Cannot give Rousseau any intelligence. I have got a most severe fit of the Gout & have lost my Philosopher. When I did my self the honor of writing to you the last, I said I should directly send to invite Rousseau over, as I could not come to him. So on Monday I sent, behold he & Mademslle took Chaise for London on Friday, & where they are I know not. Whether he is gone for any advice for himself, or her I am ignorant, but he has left me every jot as odd a letter as he formerly sent you. If you saw it I'm sure you would most heartily laugh. Tis in short just as you foretold. In his letter he left for me I find he takes it ill I did not come directly over to Wootton; tho' it is not in my power to stirr 2 yards. But without openly saying it, I can easily perceive him to be vastly uneasy & infinitely suspicious of my having any sort of correspondence with Mr. Hume. God help him, I'm sure I excessively pity him. Suppose I soon again hear from him, as I have by this post wrote to him, at Rougemont, Green Lattice or at Mr Rustans, my letter will find him.

I am Dear Sir

Your Most Obedient 
Hble Servant
