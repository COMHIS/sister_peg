St. James's May 22d 1767

Sir,

I am directed by Mr. Secretary Conway to send you a Copy of a Memorandum He has just receiv'd from the Lord Advocate of Scotland relative to an attempt made to Assassinate Mr. Gordon Collector of the Customs at Ayr in March last, & I am to desire You will lay the same before the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury, & inform me what Reward they think proper to offer for the Discovery of any of the Persons concerned, in order that it may be annexed to the Advertisement which the General intends to have printed in the Gazette of Tomorrow Night.

 I am, &c.

David Hume.
