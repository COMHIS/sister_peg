Sir,

Your friend is far from being well; but it seems to be nothing but his usual disorder that has fallen into a low way, and fills him with a hundred imaginary complaints, and renders him peevish to the last degree. I am afraid this may last for some time. It renders him very uneasy to himself, and to every body about him. Whatever desire I may have to see you here, I suppose you will not think it proper to pay your visit at present. I am, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant,

David Hume.
