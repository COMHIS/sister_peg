Dear Strahan,

As Sir Gilbert Elliot, who franks my News Papers, has by this time vacated his Seat, I must desire you to stop the Chronicle till he be re-elected, and is return'd. I applaud very much that Gentleman's Conduct: Nothing can be more honorable for himself and advantageous to the public. If Lord Guilford's Death shoud call Lord North to the House of Peers, I see none so fit to fill his place as Sir Gilbert. It is time, that the King shoud set himself above regarding the low malignant Prejudices of the Rabble.

As soon as you have come to a Resolution about reprinting my History, I shoud be glad to hear from you. I think I never see this last Quarto Edition advertis'd. You had in the Chronicle lately a very good Paper sign'd Marcellus; also a good Paper sign'd Posseius. You do not probably know the Authors.

 I am Dear Strahan 
Yours sincerely



David Hume
