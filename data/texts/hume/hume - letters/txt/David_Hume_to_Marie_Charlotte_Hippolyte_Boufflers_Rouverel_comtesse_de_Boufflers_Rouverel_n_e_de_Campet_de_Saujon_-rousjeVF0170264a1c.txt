. . . To show your Ladyship that I pretend to have some interest with you, I intended as soon as I had the honour of seeing you, to employ my good offices in endeavouring to remove a displeasure which M. Rousseau imagines you had contracted against him. Lord Marischal, some weeks ago, showed me a letter from him, in which he implores my Lord's intercession for that purpose; on the supposition, that this nobleman would meet you at London before your departure. M. Rousseau said, that he knew not how to make advances to any person; and that you was even the only one whom he could run after, when he found you was deserting him.

I understand by Lord Marischal that you was displeased with our savage philosopher for refusing in so peremptory a manner the advantages offered him by the King of Prussia; and my Lord devolved over to me the task of giving you satisfaction on that head. But I find that your Ladyship, by previously forgiving this one caprice more in a man, who is so little regulated by the common rules of conduct, has deprived me of all merit in my intercession. . . .
