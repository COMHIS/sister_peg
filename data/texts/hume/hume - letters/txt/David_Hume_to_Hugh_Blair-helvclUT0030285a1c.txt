. . . Helvetius & Saurin both told me at Paris, that they had been consulted by Montesquieu about his Esprit des loix. They us'd the freedom to tell him, as their fix'd opinion, that he ought to suppress the book, which, they forsaw, wou'd very much injure his reputation. They said to me that no doubt I thought they had reason to be asham'd of their judgement. But still, added they, you may observe that the public are very much return'd from their first admiration of that book, and we are perswaded that they will daily return still more. I hope that I shall be found a false prophet as much as these gentlemen, for tho' the Esprit des loix be considerably sunk in vogue, & will probably sink farther, it maintains a high reputation, and probably will never be totally neglected. It has considerable merit, notwithstanding the glare of its pointed wit, and notwithstanding its false refinements and its rash and crude positions.

Helvetius and Saurin assur'd me that this freedom of theirs never lost them any thing of Montesquieu's friendship. . . .
