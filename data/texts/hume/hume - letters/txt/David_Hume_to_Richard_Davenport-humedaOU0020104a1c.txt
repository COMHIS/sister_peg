Dear Sir

You wou'd see by the News Papers, that my Friends at Paris have found it necessary to publish an Account of this strange and ridiculous Affair between Rousseau and me, together with all the original Letters. He had wrote Defiances against me to the different Parts of Europe: His Friends had been very industrious in showing these Letters: Some of them had even got into the public Papers: And on the whole, things had come to that Extremity, that my Silence wou'd universally have been interpreted as a Sign of Guilt. There will, no doubt, be an English Translation soon published; & the Affair, tho' very little worthy of the public Attention, will be in every body's hands. Your Name is often mention'd, but always with the Regard that is due to it. Among other particulars of Rousseau's Letters to his Friends, he says, that, if I ever publish our Correspondence, it will be with enormous Falsifications: I doubt not, but he will now have Recourse to that Shift: But please to let him know, that I have all his original Letters and will deposit them in the Mus√¶um, to prevent such a Calumny. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant,

David Hume
