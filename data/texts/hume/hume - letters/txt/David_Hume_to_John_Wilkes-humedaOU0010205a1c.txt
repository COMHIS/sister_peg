Dear Sir

This will be delivered to you by Mr Hamilton, my Bookseller, whom I have likewise desir'd to put into your hands a Copy of my History, which I beg you to accept of. There were only a few copies of the large Paper thrown off; & I was desirous you shou'd read it with as little Disadvantage as possible. If I had had the Honor to be longer known to you, you wou'd have found, that nothing cou'd oblige me more than a free Criticism & Censure. Will you take my Word for it, and venture the Experiment? I know, that in many particulars, especially the Language, you wou'd be able, if you pleas'd to give me good Advice. I beg of you to remark, as you go along, such Words or Phrazes, as appear to you wrong or suspicious; and to inform me of them. You cou'd not do me a better Office: Notwithstanding all the Pains, which I have taken in the Study of the English Language, I am still jealous of my Pen. As to my Tongue, you have seen, that I regard it as totally desperate and irreclaimable.

Mr Hamilton is of Opinion, that your Countenance & Protection wou'd be of Use to him in London. He is a very honest Man; and I dare venture to recommend him to your good Offices. I beg to be rememberd to Mr Stowe; and if you see Dr Armstrong let him know, that I am ambitious of retaining a Part in his Memory.

 I am Dr Sir Your most obedient, humble Servt

David Hume.
