. . . The criticisms in the character of Deputy received soon after the publication, were of such a nature that there was no danger of my mistaking the author of them, I acknowledge the justness of all your observations and if there had been an opportunity of showing you those parts of the manuscript before they were printed, all due attention would have been paid to the criticisms with which you have now favoured me. . . .

I was told yesterday that a very eminent Critick here who upon the whole is very partial to these Letters, has been at pains however to select the Scotticisms which appear in them, and that the number of them is very considerable. The person who acquainted me of this is at my desire to get me a compleat list of them which shall be forwarded to you that I may have the benefit of your Decision from which I shall make no appeal whatever the judgment be. In a company of English Criticks where I happened to dine to-day and to mention this discovery of the Scotticisms, I pleaded in my defence that it was not easy, scarce possible for an Inhabitant of the North of Tweed to avoid them, but this plea was overruled, and for the purpose of refuting me, the works of two of my best friends on the North of Tweed were appealed to as evidence against me, I mean Dr Robertson's and your own. I hope the fact is not true and therefer if you are conscious of any Scotticisms in your own works or in Dr Robertson's it would be a kind thing to me upon this occasion to favour me with a communication of them. If I can but suffer in good company I shall have no regret at being condemned for an offence of this nature. . . .
