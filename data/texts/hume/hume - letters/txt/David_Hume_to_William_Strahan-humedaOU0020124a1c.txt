Dear Strahan

It was not possible for me to get an Opportunity last Night of speaking to Lord Hertford; I shall try if I can be more fortunate this Evening; and I shall as soon as possible, give you Information: A Moment will be sufficient, as I have only to put him in Mind of his Engagements. Yours

D. H.
