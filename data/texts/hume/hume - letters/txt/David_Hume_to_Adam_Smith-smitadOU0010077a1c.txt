Ninewells, 29 June 1761

Dear Smith.

As your Professorship of Hebrew is vacant, I have been applyd to in behalf of young Mr Cummin, and you are the Person with whom I am supposed to have some Interest. But as I imagine you will not put this Election on the Footing of Interest, I shall say nothing on that head; but shall speak much more to the Purpose, by informing you, that I have known Mr Cummin for some time, and have esteemed him a young Man of exceeding good Capacity, and of a Turn towards Literature. He tells me, that he has made the Oriental Tongues and particularly the Hebrew a Part of his Study and has made some Proficiency in them: But of this Fact, craving his Pardon, I must be allowd to entertain some Doubt: For if Hebrew Roots, as Cowley says, thrive best in barren Soil, he has a small Chance of producing any great Crop of them. But as you commonly regard the Professorship of Hebrew as a Step towards other Professorships, in which a good Capacity can better display itself; you will permit me to give it as my Opinion, that you will find it difficult to pitch on a young Man, who is more likely to be a Credit to your College, by his Knowlege and Industry.

I am so far on my Road to London, where I hope to see you this Season. I shall lodge in Miss Elliots Lisle Street Leicester Fields; and I beg it of you to let me hear from you the Moment of your Arrival. I am Dear Smith

Yours sincerely 
David Hume
