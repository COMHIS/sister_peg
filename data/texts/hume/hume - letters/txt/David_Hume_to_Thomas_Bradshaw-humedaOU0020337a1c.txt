During the hurry of your Business, while the Parliament was sitting, I forbore giving you or Ld North any trouble: But at present, while you may have a little more Leizure, I hope you will excuse my putting you in mind of that Note, which you wrote me by the Duke of Graftons Direction, and of which I use the Freedom of enclosing you a Copy. You then said, that the Duke woud recommend me to his Successor; but perhaps it has been forgot during the Tumult of Business which ensud upon his Grace's Resignation. I hope you will be so good as to lay my Case before Lord North who will be pleasd to consider the Circumstances of my Claim. I resign myself entirely to his Lordship's Wisdom, and shall hold this Office, if it fall vacant, from his Favour, without making any new Applications either to the Duke of Grafton or Lord Hertford or Mr Conway. I am fully sensible of their Goodness to me; but Sollicitations of every kind, I have ever carefully avoided, even when the State of my Fortune seemd more to warrant them than at present.

 Perhaps, some Office of an equivalent Value may fall vacant in this Country; and as my receiving it woud be a saving to the civil List, I hope that his Lordship woud admit my Application with Indulgence and not consider it as any Impropriety.
