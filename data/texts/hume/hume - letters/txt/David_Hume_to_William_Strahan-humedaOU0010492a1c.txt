Paris 26 of Jany. 1765

Dear Sir

I receivd both your Letters, which gave me great Satisfaction. Your Accounts of things are the fullest and most candid I meet with; and if your Leizure allowd you, you coud not do me a greater Satisfaction, than to continue them, when any thing remarkable occurs. I think there is all the Probability that this will prove a quiet Session; and there is a general Tranquillity established in Europe; so that we have nothing to do but cultivate Letters: There appears here a much greater Zeal of that kind than in England; but the best & most taking works of the French are generally published in Geneva or Holland, and are in London before they are in Paris: So that I cannot have an Opportunity of serving you in the way I coud wish. I am sorry, that the last Publication has not been successful. I only saw the Beginning and judged from the Authors Character. The Beginning is much the best of the Work. I have not lost view of continuing my History. But as to the Point of my rising in Reputation, I doubt much of it: The mad and wicked Rage against the Scots, I am told, continues and encreases, and the English are such a mobbish People as never to distinguish. Happily their Opinion gives me no great Concern. I see in your Chronicle an Abridgement of a Treatise on the Constitution; which Treatise seems to be nothing but an Abridgement of my History; yet I shall engage, that the Author has not nam'd me from the beginning to the end of his Performance. On the whole, I can have no Motive of Ambition or Love of Fame to continue my History: Money in my present Circumstances is no Temptation: If I execute that Work, as is probable, it must be for Amusement to myself, after I am tir'd of Idleness. My Health and Spirits are as good at present as when I was five and twenty. Believe me Dear Sir with great Sincerity

 Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant
