Mr Hume presents his Compliments to Signior Guiseppe. Hopes he is return'd home. Lord Kaims, Dr Blair, and Mr Hume have waited for him with great Impatience, and wish to pass to morrow in his Company, either at Newton or Blair-Drummond, whichever will be most convenient for him, viz., or videlicet, or to wit, at Newton, if he return to night or at Blair Drummond, if he return to morrow, so late as not to be able to give them timeous or rather timely Information of his Arrival.
