St Andrews Square 25 of Jany 1774

Dear Strahan

I write to you in a great hurry and with great Earnestness: It is to beg your Vote and Interest in the India house for Coll. Stuart, Brother to our Friend, Andrew, whose Appointment to command in Bombay is in danger of being over-haul'd by the Court of Proprietors. This woud be a most invidious Measure, very cruel to the Collonel and all his Friends. I know that on Andrew's Account, you woud interest yourself against it; but as he thinks, that my Entreaties woud add something to your Zeal, I hereby join them in the most earnest manner, tho' indeed rather to satisfy him, than that I think they will be any-wise necessary.

 I am &c

David Hume.
