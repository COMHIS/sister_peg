Edinburgh 30 of July 1776

Dear Sir

I must give you the trouble of making a new Correction, which however will be easily done. It is in the second Volume of my philosophical Pieces: That whole Passage from Page 231 till Page 239 line 3 must be thrown into an Appendix under the Title Of Self-love: It must be the second Appendix; consequently the second Appendix becomes the third, and the third Appendix, the fourth. In like manner, what is called in Page 239, Part 2 must be Part 1, as also that in Page 241 must be Part 2. Let the Printer observe this Alteration with regard to the Appendixes in the Table of Contents.

I feel myself a good deal better since I am settled here, and never stir abroad except in a Chair. My Physicians say everywhere that they have cured me, which is very agreeable Intelligence, though somewhat new to me.

I am glad to hear, that you and Dr Robertson are fully agreed: It gives me pleasure on his account, and I hope, in the Issue, upon yours. I am dear Sir

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.

P.S. The Title of the Section in Page 231 remains the same as before, viz Of Benevolence.
