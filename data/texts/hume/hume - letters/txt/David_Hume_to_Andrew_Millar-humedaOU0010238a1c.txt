Dear Sir

I return you the Dedication with a few Corrections. I hope it will not be too much Trouble to insert the Correction, which I sent you two Posts ago. The Subject of that Letter may be answerd at your Leizure: For there is no Hurry in it. Mr Kincaid has none of the first or fourth Volumes, which he can send you. I shall send you the other two Volumes corrected by the Stage Coach this day sennight. Mr Hume is at present employd in making some Alterations on his Douglas, chiefly in the last Act, which did not correspond to the great Beauty of the rest: After that, he sets out for London, where you will see him. I am Dr Sir

 Yours

D. H.

P.S.

I thank you for your Pamphlet. It will serve to keep that lying Rogue in the Mire: For I think he was thrown in it before. I suppose, no body now countenances him.
