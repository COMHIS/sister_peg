Mr Hume's Compliments to Mr Strahan. He sent him the two first Sheets of this Work, which he hopes Mr Strahan receivd. In case he has not, Mr Hume recommends it to Mr Strahan to be translated into English. It is a work of Made de Riccoboni, so well known by the Letters of Lady Juliette Catesby. Mr Hume will send over the other Sheets as they come from the Press. He desires Mr Strahan to write to him. His Direction is under Cover to Lord Hertford at Northumberland House in the Strand.

Paris, 1 of April, 1764.

 This Sheet may come to Mr Strahan's hand before the two others: As this goes by a Messenger; the other by General Clerk.
