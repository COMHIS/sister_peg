St Andrews Square 2 of April 1774

Dear Sir

There is a Subject which I was desird to mention to you, but which I delay'd, till your Application to Parliament were finish'd, that you might know on what footing your literary Property was to stand: It is with regard to Dr Wallace's manuscript, which was certainly finishd for the Press and which I think a very good Book: I told his Son about four or five months ago, before the Decision of the House of Peers, that he ought not to expect above 500 pounds for it; and he has return'd so far to my Sentiments, as to leave the Matter entirely to me; I shoud wish to know, therefore, what you think you cou'd afford. I imagine this Decision will not very much alter the Value of literary Property; For if you coud, by a tacite convention among yourselves, make a Property of the Dauphin's Virgil, without a single Line in Virgil's hand, or Ru√¶us's or the Dauphin's, I see not why you may not keep Possession of all your Books as before. However, this Decision throws you into some Uncertainty, and you may be cautious for some time in entering on any considerable Purchase.

Lord Kaims's Sketches have here been published some weeks; and by the Reception it has met with, is not likely to be very popular, according to the prodigiously sanguine Expectations of the Author. But after his Elements of Criticism met with some Success, I shall never venture to make any Prophecy on that head. I am glad to hear, that in your Bargain with him, you had a saving Clause to ensure you against Loss. Cou'd any such Clause be devis'd with regard to Dr Wallace's Book? In the mean time, I ask 500 pounds for it; as you desire that a positive Demand shoud always be made, which is indeed but reasonable. It is about half the Size of Lord Kaims's Sketches; and is better writ.

 I am Dear Sir Yours sincerely

David Hume.
