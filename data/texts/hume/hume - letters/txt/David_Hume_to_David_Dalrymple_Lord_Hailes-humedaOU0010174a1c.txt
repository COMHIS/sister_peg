Edinburgh 3d of May 1753.

Sir

I give you this Trouble, in order to put you in Mind of your Promise. I assure you, that I shall think myself much obligd to you, if you will run over my Enquiry, & remark what you think amiss either in Language or Argument. Besides, that I am extremely anxious to obtain some Degree of Correctness in all my Attempts; I must confess, that I have a Partiality for that Work, & esteem it the most tolerable of anything I have composd. I have sent off some Sheets for the Press; but it is to be return'd to me Sheet by Sheet, or what they call the Proof Sheet; & therefore it will still be in my Power to reap Benefit from your Corrections. Such an undertaking, I woud fain believe, beside being very obliging to me, woud be useful to yourself, & be a kind of Exercise, which wou'd render you a scrupulous Critic in Language & Composition.

Since I saw you, we have had a Pamphlet from London, animadverting upon that Work. The Pamphlet is well wrote, but ill reasond.

When you read it, I know you'll say, that this Opinion of mine proceeds from this, that the Author approves of my Composition but not of my Argument; & therefore I am willing to allow him to be a Judge of the former, not of the latter.

I am Sir Yours usque ad aras 
David Hume.
