Dear Sir

I received the favour of yours & am very Sorry this ugly affair has given you so much trouble, I have not seen Rousseau of a long time & am ignorant whether he has seen Exposé Succinct &c. Will take care to communicate to him what you have desir'd; Surely he will be Surpriz'd to read Mr. D'Alembert's declaration As an unfortunate Stranger, I can't help pittying him, & heartily wish there had been no cause to have made the business publick. I have often said, that I never could find out any sort of reason, (at least none that had any weight with me) for his avoiding his Majesty's intended bounty to him — this is a kind of Philosophy which I have no comprehension of.

Sometime in January I purpose being in Town & hope to have the pleasure of meeting you there which will be extremely agreeable to

Dr Sir your Most oblidged Humble Servant
