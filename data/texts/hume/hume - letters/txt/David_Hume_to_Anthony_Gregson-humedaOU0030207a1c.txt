Edinburgh St Andrews Square 23 April 1774

Sir

You probably know, that your Brother owed me by Bond the Sum of 900 pounds, for which I have Infeftment on the Estate of Stonerig. He usually pay'd me the Interest once in two Years; and tho' commonly in this Country Interest be now more regularly pay'd every Year, I did not scruple to give him this Indulgence, on account of the Difficulty he found of conveying to me the Money. It is proper to inform you, that at Whitsunday next two Years will be due; and you will certainly incline at that time to make payment of it, in the Name and on the behalf of your Nephew, who is now my Debtor. When you send me the Money, be so good as to inform me of your Nephew's Christen'd Name, that I may make the Discharge regular

 I am Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
