Dear Doctor

I did not apply, in your Favour, to any Minister of State, because any small Interest I may be suppos'd to possess was already bespoke for Mr Drysdale, who wants it much more than you, and whom you yourself seem'd not willing to enter into Competition with. I shou'd willingly have seconded Dr Wallace's Application for the Thistle; but as the Dr had, of himself, appeald to me for a Character, which I coud with Pleasure have given him in the amplest Manner, I expected every day that Mr Conway wou'd have spoke to me of the Matter, which he never did: The Secretary told me yesterday that for these two small Offices more Applications had been made to him by able and learned Divines than if Canterbury & Durham had been both vacant: a Proof what poor Prizes you in Scotland have to contend for.

You will be surprizd, dear Doctor, when I desire you most earnestly never in your Life to show to any mortal creature the Letters I wrote you with Regard to Rousseau: He is surely the blackest and most atrocious Villain, beyond comparison, that now exists in the World; and I am heartily asham'd of any thing I ever wrote in his Favour. I know you will pity me, when I tell you, that I am afraid I must publish this to the world in a Pamphlet, which must contain an account of the whole Transaction between us. My only Comfort is, that the Matter will be so clear as not to leave to any mortal the smallest possibility of Doubt: You know how dangerous any Controversy on a disputable Point woud be with a man of his Talents. I know not where the Miscreant will now retire to, in order [to] hide his Head from this Infamy. I am Dear Dr

 Yours most sincerely

David Hume

Lisle Street Leicester Fields 1 of July 1766.

P.S.

If you suspect any body took any Copies of any part of my Letters, employ all your Address and Influence to recover them. I suspect Mrs Cockburn: You was so imprudent as even to lend her my Letters.
