Dear Sir

You will see by the franking of my Letter whom we have with us. I was so happy as to prevail on the Doctor to be my Guest during his Stay here, which we hope will be for ten days or a fortnight. He got over from Ireland in a short Interval between two Hurricanes by a particular Providence. At least I hope that he considers it in that Light. I am Dear Strahan

 Yours &c

D. H.
