London 26 Nov 1764

. . . I shall not make any new Edition of the Stewarts till I inform you, but I am perswaded next Spring or Summer I shall. Their Sale have  been more than the others. They came out first and ye rest some years after wc was the cause, but there are above 2500 compleat Setts sold in the 4to of ye lowest sale vols, but upwards of 3000 of the Stewarts. Of yr 8vo history near 2000 and yr 8vo Essays 400. These things I wrote from Kew about 3 mts ago, and also yt they were in daily Sale. Sure this is full encouragement for yo to go on. Yr Essays 8vo were only published in May, what has been sold of ym of all ye different editions I cannot recollect. I was asked yt question at St James's the other day, when I said I considered yr Works as Classicks, that I never numbered ye Editions as I did in Books We wished to puff. This I said before many Clergy.

I am not a little surprized to see one of yr excellent Understanding and merit so anxious about the Sale when the Bookseller intirely concernd never complained, but on the Contrary, would be ready to give you to yr utmost wish any encouragement to proceed in yr History, and in Truth considering the Nº of Enemies from particular Essays have risen from Interest, Bigottery, folly and knavery not less than one hundred Thousand It is rather astonishing, yr Works have sold so much. While Men are Men this is to be expected and you are the last man I should ever [have] thought could [have] paid ye least attention to such Things. beleive me D S the furder you go in yr History the more it will sell, wrote with the same Spirit of impartiality as that published, and Therefer confirm my hopes and yt of all yr friends with yr Intention of carrying it on.

I wrote also to you from Kew that the Edition of yr Essays of duodecimo are out of print, pray shall they be reprinted from ye 8vo?

 I am now going thro' a course of Adverts of yr Works, &:c: a copy of wc I inclose you . . . .
