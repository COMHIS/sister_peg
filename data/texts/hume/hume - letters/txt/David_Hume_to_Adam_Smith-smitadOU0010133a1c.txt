[London, ? end of Sept. 1767 ]

Dear Smith,

I thank you for your friendly Resentment against the Right Reverend, I easily forgive our Friend for not making me any Apology. Tis with great Concern I observe, that he has not Spirits enough for such an Effort, and perhaps is fetterd by some kind of Dependance on his Brute of a Brother. I have receivd two Letters from him in our usual friendly Style and have answered him in the same. Yours

D. H.
