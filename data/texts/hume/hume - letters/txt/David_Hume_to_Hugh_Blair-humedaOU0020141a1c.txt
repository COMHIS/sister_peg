London. 27 of May 1767

Dear Doctor

I find you have got your Affair done without me, and that the Chief Baron has anticipated my Endeavours and deprivd me of the Merit of obeying your Commands. I am glad, however, it is done.

Since you are curious to hear Rousseau's Story, I shall tell you the Sequel of it . . . .

We hear that notwithstanding his imagined Captivity he has passd over to Calais; where he is likely to experience what real Captivity is. I have however us'd my Perswasion with Monsr de Guerchi to represent him to his Court as a real Madman, more an Object of Compassion than of Anger. We shall no doubt see his Memoirs in a little time which will be full of Eloquence & Extravagance; tho' perhaps as reasonable as any of his past Productions. For I do not imagine he was ever much more in his Senses than at present. I think I may be entirely without Anxiety concerning all his future Productions.

Pray how has the General Assembly passd? I have had a long Letter from Mass David Dickson complaining of your Injustice. Has John Home any Thoughts of coming up?

Tell Robertson, that the Compliment at the End of General Conway's Letter to him was of my composing, without any Orders from him. He smild when he read it; but said it was very proper, and signd it. These are not bad Puffs from Ministers of State, as the silly World goes.
