Dear Brother

Dr Black tells me plainly, like a man of Sense, that I shall dye soon, which was no disagreeable news to me: He says, I shall dye of weakness & Inanition; & perhaps give little or no warning. But tho I be growing sensibly weaker every day, this period seems not to be approaching; & I shall have time enough to inform you, & to desire your Company, which will be very agreeable to me: But at this time, your presence is necessary at Ninewells, to settle Josey & comfort his mother. Davie will be also very useful with you: I am much pleased with his Tenderness & friendship. I beg therefore that neither you nor he may set out; & as the communication between us, is open & frequent, I promise to give you timely information.
