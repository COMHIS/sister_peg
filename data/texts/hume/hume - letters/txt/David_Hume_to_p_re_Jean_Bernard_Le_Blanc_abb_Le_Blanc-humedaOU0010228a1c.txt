Sir

It is some time ago, that I receivd and read with Pleasure the excellent Translation, with which you have honour'd my political Discourses. It gives me great Satisfaction to find my Sense so justly preservd, and at the same time embellish'd by the Propriety & Elegance of your Expressions. I have sent you the first Volume of my History of Great Britain; and wou'd consider it as a very great Happiness, if you cou'd think it worthy your Approbation; but much more, if it cou'd engage you to do it the same Honour, that you have done to the political Discourses. There are many Passages in the History, which will require Notes to explain them to Foreigners; and I know none so capable of that Undertaking as yourself. Your Knowledge of the English Constitution and Manners will enable you to remove all Difficulties: and if you shou'd happen to be at a Loss in any Place, be so good as to write me; and I shall endeavor to communicate to you all the Lights, which I have been able to acquire by a long Application to this Subject. I have the honour to be

 Sir 
Your most obedient and most humble 
Servant
