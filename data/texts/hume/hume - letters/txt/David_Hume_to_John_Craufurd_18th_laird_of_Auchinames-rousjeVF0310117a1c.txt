Dear Jack

[. . .] It happend as you foresaw; that I shoud at last, whether I wou'd or not, be oblig'd to give to the Public an Account of this ridiculous Affair between Rousseau and me. D'Alembert has made use of the discretionary Power I gave him, and has printed the Narrative you saw, with a Preface, giving an Account of the Necessity which he lay under to do so. The only thing, that displeases me is a Declaration annex'd, which is very disobliging to Horace Walpole: There is also a little Squib thrown at Mde. du Deffan if I understand it right. Besides, some obliging things which I said, from my sincere Sentiments, of Mr. Walpole, are expung'd, which is a little unaccountable. Is it possible, that a Man of such Parts & Virtues as Dalembert can bear an Ill will to Mr. Walpole merely because the latter has a Friendship for a Person whom the former hates? And does Philosophy serve us to so little purpose? Voltaire says you are a Philosopher: and all the world knows Rousseau to be one: Voltaire himself is also one: I say nothing: but the Devil himself will not hinder me from thinking.

I have also wrote to Mr. Walpole about this Affair of Dalembert's Declaration; and as he makes Profession of being no Philosopher, I doubt not but I shall find him a reasonable Man. I only forgot to mention one thing to Mr Walpole, which I desire you to mention to him, when you see him. It is this: The Duke of Richmond may think it odd, that in a Letter of mine to Rousseau I should have promis'd him the Duke's good Offices, tho' I had never spoke to his Grace on the Subject. But my Reason for trusting to the Duke was, that I knew his great Esteem for Rousseau, and Mr. Walpole besides, promised me, if it was necessary, his good Offices with the Duke, as he had already done with General Conway. [. . .]

Yours sincerely
