Paris 22d of Septr 1765

Sir

I have the Honour of transmitting to your Excellency the enclos'd Letter from the King of Poland, Duke of Lorraine, to His Majesty, in answer to that which you was pleas'd to send to me.

The Accounts of the Dauphin's State of Health are still bad. All the Care, that is taken to conceal it, cannot hinder this Intelligence from transpiring.

I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard, Sir

 Your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble Servant



David Hume
