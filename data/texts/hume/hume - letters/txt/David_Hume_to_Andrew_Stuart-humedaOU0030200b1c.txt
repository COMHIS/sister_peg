St Andrews Square 22 of March 1773

My Dear Sir

I always considered your Letters to the Baron as common to him and me: However, I am glad to hear also from you. We do not understand the Reason why your Letters were never sold. We do not doubt but you had a good Reason; I only say we do not understand it. We wish you had not stop'd short half way; nor woud scruple to give a second Edition.

All your Friends wish to see you next Summer; but I find all of them unite in the Notion, that you have done enough, and ought not to persecute the poor chief Justice any more. It is true; you will be apt to think, from the Experience of the past, that you do better in following your own Opinion than theirs.

When Lord Essex receiv'd a Blow from the Queen, the Chancellor advisd him to bear it patiently, and told him, that his Friends, being Lookers on, coud judge better of the Game, than he who was a Player: It is true, my Lord, replyd Essex, but as you only see, and I feel, I am the better Judge in this case.

Pray, what says now the prudent Sir Gilbert?

Your Deputy, who has a most humble and most respectful Esteem for you, as in Duty bound, tells me, that he is not yet satisfy'd concerning the Reason of that Omission, which, he says, he wrote to you about.

I suppose your great English Critic is Johnson: I do not believe he has found any Scottcism , except, perhaps, circumstantiate. However, I beseech you, get his List, and send it to me.

Lord Monboddo, who maintains that all men had originally Tails, asserts, that you have likewise horns.

 I am Ever yours

D. H.
