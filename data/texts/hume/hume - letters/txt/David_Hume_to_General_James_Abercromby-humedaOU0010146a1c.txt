Dear Collonel,

Endeavour to make Fraser believe I am in earnest. If the thing takes, you may easily find some Body to personate Mr Cockburn; & you may swear to the Truth of the whole. To make it more probable, you may say, that you suspect too much Study has made me crazy; otherwise I had never thought of so foolish a thing.

If there be any Probability of succeeding, an Advertisement, like that which is on the following Page, may be put into any of the public Papers. That is, if you think, que le jeu vaut la chandelle.

My Compliments to Mrs Abercromby. I hope some day to regain her good Opinion. It shall be the great Object of my Ambition.

Tell the Dr I shall answer him sooner than he did me. He will assist you very well in any Cheat or Roguery: But do not attempt it, unless you think you can all be Masters of your Countenance.

This is a Note, not a Letter. Yours sincerely

Da Hume.

Read Fraser the Letter, but do not put it into his hands: He will tear it. Show him first my other Letter to you.
