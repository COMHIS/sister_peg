Potsdam 7 July 1767

. . . I pity Rousseau who thinks there is so generall a conspiracy against him, it is most generous in you to wish to serve him, I would if I knew how, but my advice is of little weight, had it been of any he would have done you justice. He will have his way. I not only think General Conway partaker in the plot with you, but even the King joined in it. What a misfortune it is that his life, I mean that of Jean Jaques, and his quiet is poysoned by his distrustfull temper. . . .
