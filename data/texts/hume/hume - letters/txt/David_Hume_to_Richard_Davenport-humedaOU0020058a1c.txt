Dear Sir

I conjecture from your Letter, that Rousseau had sent you the Copies of some of my Letters to him, since he went to Wootton. I wish heartily you coud get Copies of all them, and wou'd send them to me. You wou'd find every one of them extreme friendly, and even wrote with the greatest Discretion as well as Civility. It wou'd be of no Consequence for me to have Copies of them, were he not the most dangerous Man in the World, on account of his Malice and his Talents: I cannot take too many Precautions against him. I doubt not but you have long ago deliverd to him my Letter, which I sent you open; and that you have carefully remarked the Effects of it. I pray heartily on all Accounts that your Grandson may be thoroughly recover'd. You see how innocent I am; yet I assure you I feel Uneasyness from the Pain which you must feel on this Occasion.

If he denies, that he ever gave his Consent to the solliciting this Pension, tell him of his Letter to Lord Mareschal, and his thanking General Conway and General Gr√¶me for their Friendship in this Affair. I am

 Dear Sir 
Your most obedient & most humble Servant
