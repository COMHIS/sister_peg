Brewer Street 10 March 1769.

It is long since I sent off all the sheets of Charles V; and I suppose they have come safe to hand, and that the work will soon be published in Paris. It is now near a week since it has been published in London; and as far as we can judge, in so short a time, will meet with very great success. The author complains to me that he never hears from you; I excuse you on account of your indolence; but he and I will be impatient to know the sentiments of Paris with regard to the performance.

Poor Stuart has lost his cause which he had laboured with such assiduity, such integrity, and such capacity. Never was any sentence more unjust: but the cause had become so complicate, that it had gone beyond the comprehension of almost all our peers; and it was in the power of Lord Mansfield, who had shown a violent partiality from the beginning, to twist and turn it as he pleased and to command the plurality of votes.

If the event was in one respect disastrous and extraordinary for Stuart, it was in another as fortunate and extraordinary. On rising next morning, he found on his table a bond of annuity for 400 pounds a year, sent him by a friend, a man of sense, who had no interest in the cause, but who chose this opportunity to express his esteem and affection for Stuart. The person who has done this noble action, is Pulteney; you may have seen him at Paris with Stuart: he then bore the name of Johnstone. All the lawyers also on the side of Douglas have sent to Stuart an acknowledgment of his integrity and honour in the conduct of this cause. These circumstances will give pleasure to the seiks in the Rue Royale, who had an esteem for Stuart. I beg my compliments to them.
