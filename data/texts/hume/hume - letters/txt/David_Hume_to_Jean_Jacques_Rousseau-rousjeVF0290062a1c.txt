My Dear Sir

We have had very bad Weather for some time past, which has made me uneasy with regard to you. I hope you was able to get thro' the Mountains of Derbyshire without any bad Accident.

The Artist has brought me a Model of your Bust, and told me, that you intended it for a Friend. Pray tell me to whom I shall deliver it.

Mr Malthus was with me to day, who desires his Compliments to you. He regreats very much your Change of Resolution.

I am

Yours sincerely 
David Hume
