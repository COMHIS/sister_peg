St Andrews Square 10 of April 1773.

To day News arriv'd in town that the Air Bank had shut up; and as many people think for ever. I hear that the Duke of Bucleugh is on the Road: The Country will be in prodigious distress for Money this term. Sir G. Colebroke's Bankruptcy is thought to be the immediate Cause of this Event.

Have you seen Macpherson's Homer? It is hard to tell whether the Attempt or the Execution be worse. I hear he is employd by the Booksellers to continue my History: But in my Opinion, of all men of Parts, he has the most anti-historical Head in the Universe.

Have you seen Sir John Dalrymple? It is strange what a Rage is against him, on account of the most commendable Action in his Life. His Collection is curious but introduces no new Light into the civil, whatever it may, into the biographical & anecdotical History of the times.

Have you seen Alonzo? Very slovenly Versification, some pathetic, but too much resembling Douglas.

I expect to see you soon. Have you been busy, and whether in pulling down or building up?

D. H.
