My dear Friend

I have got an Invitation, accompany'd with great Prospects and Expectations, from Lord Hartford, if I woud accompany him, tho' at first without any Character, in his Embassy to Paris. I hesitated much on the Acceptance of this Offer, tho' in Appearance very inviting; and I thought it ridiculous, at my Years, to be entering on a new Scene, and to put myself in the Lists as a Candidate of Fortune. But I reflected, that I had in a manner abjur'd all literary Occupations, that I resolvd to give up my future Life entirely to Amusements, that there coud not be a better Pastime than such a Journey, especially with a Man of Lord Hertford's Character, and that it wou'd be easy to prevent my Acceptance from having the least Appearance of Dependance: For these Reasons, and by the Advice of every Friend, whom I consulted, I at last agreed to accompany his Lordship, and I set out to morrow for London. I am a little hurry'd in my Preparations: But I coud not depart without bidding you Adieu, my good Friend, and without acquainting you with the Reasons of so sudden a Movement. I have not great Expectations of revisiting this Country soon; but I hope it will not be impossible but we may meet abroad, which will be a great Satisfaction to me. I am dear Smith

 Yours most sincerely

David Hume
