My Dear Sir

You and you alone can aid me in the most critical Affair, which, during the Course of my whole Life, I have been engaged in. I send you a Copy of Rousseau's Answer to that friendly Letter, which I wrote him, and of which I sent a Duplicate to you at Davenport. You will be astonishd, as I was, at the monstrous Ingratitude, Ferocity, and Frenzy of the Man. I send you also enclos'd my Answer, which I beg you to peruse before you deliver it. You must certainly think, that, after this Provocation, I have treated him with sufficient Temper, and that my Demand is extremely reasonable. I can insist on no less, than that he specify the Points of which I am accus'd and name the Accuser. If it were necessary, I shoud conjure you by all your Regards to Truth and Justice to second my Demand, and make him sensible of the Necessity he lies under of agreeing to it. He must himself pass for the Lyar and Calumniator, if he does not comply. Be so good, therefore, since Matters have come to this Extremity to deliver to him this Letter, and tell me his Behaviour on perusing it. You will here have Occasion to become acquainted with the Morals and Character of your Guest. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient & most humble Servant

PS.

Pray observe in what manner he disguises the Story, which I told you preceded the day of his Departure from London. I shoud be very unhappy were I engag'd with a man of less Probity and Morals than yourself.
