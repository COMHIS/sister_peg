Glasgow, 22 Feb. 1763

My dear Hume

This Letter will be presented to you by Mr Henry Herbert, a young Gentleman who is very well acquainted with your works, and upon that account extremely desirous of being introduced to the Author. As I am convinced that you will find him extremely agreable I shall make no apology for introducing him. He proposes to stay a few weeks in Edinburgh while the Company are in town and would be glad to have the liberty of calling upon you sometime when it suits your conveniency to receive him. If you indulge him in this, Both he and I will think ourselves infinitely obliged to you.

You have been long promising us a visit at Glasgow and I have made Mr Herbert promise to endeavour to bring you along with him. Tho you have resisted all my Sollicitations, I hope you will not resist this. I hope, I need not tell you that it will give me the greatest pleasure to see you. I ever am

My Dear Friend, Most affectionately 
and Sincerely yours, 
Adam Smith
