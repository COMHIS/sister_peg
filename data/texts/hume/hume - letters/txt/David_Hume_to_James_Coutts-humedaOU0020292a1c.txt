Edinburgh 14 of Feby 1775

Dear Sir

An Affair of considerable Importance has occurr'd in which I beg your Assistance and Good Offices. There is a Prospect that my Nephew, Cornet Hume, of Lord Townsend's Dragoons, may have the Offer of a Lieutenancy in the same Regiment, upon Payment of the Difference, which, I believe, is rated at 250 pounds. But be it more or less, I am very desirous of accepting the Offer. Be so good, therefore, as to send to Cox and Mair, the Agents of the Regiment, and tell them that the Money for the Purchase, is in your hands and ready to be pay'd. Perhaps, the Money you may have of mine, may not amount to the whole Sum; but whatever it is, be pleas'd to advance it in case of a demand from the Agents, and draw on me at Sight for the Remainder; if you do not rather chuse, that this small Debt shou'd lie on me, till the Payment of my next quarterly Pension. You know how important the gaining of a Step is to a young Officer; so that, as I do not question your Exactness in any thing, I can still less doubt of it on this Occasion. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume
