St. Andrew's Square 4 June 1774.

Dear John,

The enclosed came to hand to-day, and as I take it to be directed to you, I have sent it you. If on opening it you find otherwise, you may return it to me, that I may find the true owner.

You have seen, no doubt, the specimen of a Scotch review. My first conjecture was, that Carlyle was the author; but Dr Blair has convinced me that it is much more probably the production of your spiritual guide, Tom Hepburn; but, whoever be the father, the child has a great deal of salt, and spirit, and humour. I wish he would continue, tho at the hazard of my getting a rap over the knuckles from time to time: for I see in this hero the spirit of a Drawcansir, who spares neither friend nor foe. I think I can reckon about twenty people, not including the King, whom he has attacked in this short performance. I hope all his spleen is not exhausted. I should desire my compliments to him, were I not afraid that he would interpret the civility as paying blackmail to him.

 I am, dear John, 
Yours sincerely,



David Hume.
