[21 February 1773.]

Dear Sir,

I join my request to that of my friend, Dr Robertson, in favour of Mr Jardine, as well as of his young pupils, that you would admit them sometimes to pay their court to you, and would afford them your countenance and protection. You will find M. Jardine a man of sense and knowledge; and in that light I have ventured to recommend him to M. d'Alembert's acquaintance, but as I know that M. d'Alembert never goes to our friend Baron d'Holbach's, where my countryman would have access to see the best company, I would farther request, that, if you find him worthy of that society, which I make no doubt of, you would, in my name as well as your own, present him to the Baron. I suppose that the Baron's house is on the same footing as formerly, a common receptacle for all men of letters and ingenuity. But there have so many alterations happened in Paris since I was there, that I cannot blindly make this request; and I leave the matter entirely to your own discretion. I only desire, that you would assure the Baron of my sincere and inviolable attachment to him, and of my entire sense of his worth, as well as of the obligations I owe him for his friendship. I am with great regard Dear Sir,

 Your most obedient and most humble servant

David Hume.
