⟨London 20 March 1767⟩

Dear Sir

I find the Affair of Rousseau's Pension is quite finishd, all except the formal Part, which I wou'd instantly sollicit, did not General Conway think, that you had better inform him previously of the Matter, lest some new Caprice shoud seize him and lead him to reject anew his Majesty's Bounty. After he has notify'd to you or to General Conway his Acceptance, it will be easy in a day or two to have the Warrant passd at the Treasury.

 I am Dear Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
