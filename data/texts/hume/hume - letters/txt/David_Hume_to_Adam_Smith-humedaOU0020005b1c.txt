[London, ? end of January 1766]

Dear Smith

I can write as seldom and as Short as you — I am sorry I did not see you before I left Paris. I am also sorry I shall not see you there soon. I shall not be able to fix Rousseau to his Mind for some Weeks yet: He is a little variable & fanciful, tho' very agreeable. Lord Hertford is to be over some time in April. I must then wait for him; and afterwards must be dispos'd of, for some time, by his Commands. I recommended my Servant St Jean to you: If he be with you or the Duke, I am sure you will like him and keep him on; and you need say nothing of this to him. But if you did not engage him, please send to him and tell him, that as I cannot promise on my Return to Paris soon, I do not wish he woud deprive himself of any other good Service that offers. He lives at Collet's, a Hirer of Coaches in the Rue des vieux Augustins, a few Doors from the Hotel du Parc roiale where you intended to lodge. He is known either by the Name of St Jean or Jean Garneaux — Some push me to continue my History. Millar offers me any Price: All the Marlborough Papers are offerd me: And I believe no body woud venture to refuse me: But cui bono? Why shoud I forgo Idleness and Sauntering and Society; and expose myself again to the Clamours of a stupid, factious Public? I am not yet tir'd of doing nothing; and am become too wise either to mind Censure or Applause. By & bye I shall be too old to undergo so much Labour: Adieu

David Hume.
