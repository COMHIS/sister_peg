Edinburgh 13 Aug. 1776

Dear Sir

You saw me to great Advantage when I was at London, the Journey had a little revived me; which with some remains of Health and Strength, made you hope that a Cure was still practicable; But Affairs change, every day and rapidly, to the worse: My Appetite is totally gone, my Strength decays, and every bad Symptom visibly augments; so that I can now look only for a near approaching Dissolution. One would little regret Life, were it not the Experience of such good Friends, as you, whom one must leave behind them. Mais, helas! on ne laisse que des mourans: as Ninon l'Enclos said on her Death-bed. Death appears to me so little terrible on his Approaches, that I scorn to quote Heroes and Philosophers as Examples of Fortitude: a Woman of Pleasure, who, however, was also a Philosopher, is sufficient. I embrace you, Dear Sir, and probably for the last time.

David Hume.
