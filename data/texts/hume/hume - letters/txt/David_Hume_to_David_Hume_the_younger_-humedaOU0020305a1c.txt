Edinburgh 8 of Decr 1775

Dear Davy

All your Letters both to me and to your Father have [given] great Satisfaction, particularly your last: And in return, I must give y[ou the] Satisfaction of telling you, that Mr Millar is very well pleas'd with you [ ] no less than you with him. He complains only of one thing, which [is not the] usual Complaint of Tutors against their Pupils, to wit, that he is afraid you [apply yourself too] close, and may hurt your Health by too assiduous Study. I shoud not men[tion this] if I had the least Apprehension, that a hint of this Nature woud m[ake you] relax too much: But I cannot forbear saying, that every day, fair or fou[l, you] ought to use some Exercise: Relaxation for Amusement you may use [or not] as you fancy, but that for Health is absolutely necessary. When I was [of your] Age, I was inclind to give in to Excesses of the same kind; and I remember [a Story] told me by a Friend, the present Lord Pitfour: A man was riding, with [great] Violence, and running his Horse quite out of Wind: He stopt a moment to a[sk when] he might reach a particular Place. In two Hours, reply'd the Countreym[an, if you] will go slower: In four, if you be in such a Hurry. Bad Health, be[sides other] Inconveniences, is the greatest Interruption to Study in the World.

I cannot but agree with Mr Millar, that the Republican Form of [Government] is by far the best. The antient Republics were somewhat ferocious, and torn [internally] by bloody Factions; but they were still much preferable to the Monarchies or [Aristocracies] which seem to have been quite intolerable. Modern Manners have corrected this Abuse; and all the Republics in Europe, without Exception, are so well governd, that one is at a Loss to which we shoud give the Preference. But what is this general Subject of Speculation to our Purpose? For besides, that an establishd Government [cannot] without the most criminal Imputation, be disjointed from any Speculation; [Republicanism] is only fitted for a small State: And any Attempt towards it can in our [Country], produce only Anarchy, which is the immediate Forerunner of Despotism. [Will he] tell us, what is that form of a Republic which we must aspire to? Or [will the Revol]ution be afterward decided by the Sword? [One] great Advantage of a Commonwealth over our mixt Monarchy is, that it [woud consid]erably abridge our Liberty, which is growing to such an Extreme, as to be incom[patible wi]th all Government. Such Fools are they, who perpetually cry out Liberty: [and think to] augment it, by shaking off the Monarchy.

I have not heard from Josey for some time, which you may believe, has produc'd [anxious Re]flections in some of your Friends. But to show you, that you are not forgot[ten,] I showd Mr Millar's Letter to your Mother; I am afraid, said she, that [I see] some Symptoms of a Consumption in poor Davy.

[I a]m far from thinking Mr Millar's Demands in point of Money unrea[sonable. On] the contrary, I believe that I never laid out Money to better Purpose.

[Ha]rrington is an Author of Genius; but chimerical. No Laws, however rigorous, [woud ma]ke his Agrarian practicable. And as the People have only a Negative, the [Senate] woud perpetually gain Ground upon them. You remember, that Montesquieu says, that Harrington establishing his Oceana in opposition to the English Constitution is like the blind Men who built Chalcedon on the opposite [Shore] to the Seat of Byzantium. I ask you Pardon for not writing to you [sooner] but beg the Continuance of your Correspondence. My Compliments to [Mr Millar,] to whom I owe a Letter. I am Your affectionate Uncle
