Edinburgh, 28 Mar. 1763

Dear Smith

I was obligd to you both for your kind Letter and for the Opportunity which you afforded me of making Acquaintance with Mr Herbert, who appears to me a very promising young man. I set up a Chaise in May next, which will give me the Liberty of travelling about; and you may be sure a Journey to Glasgow will be one of the first I shall undertake. I intend to require with great Strictness an Account how you have been employing your Leizure; and I desire you to be ready for that purpose. Wo be to you, if the Ballance be against you. Your Friends here will also expect, that I should bring you with me. It seems to me very long since I saw you. I am Dear Smith

Yours most sincerely 
David Hume
