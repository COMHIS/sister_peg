Sir,

I am inform'd that you are in terms with M. Neuville to engage him for French Master in your Academy, and that you desire nothing but a satisfactory account of his Character and Morals to finish your Agreement with him. I use, therefore, the Freedom to write to you, in order to inform you, that he appears to me a young man who has Conduct and Discretion; but what I chiefly rely upon is the Recommendation of the Celebrated M. Diderot, whose Morals and Goodness, no less than his Genius and Learning, are known all over Europe. He has been long acquainted with M. Neuville, is entirely satisfy'd with his Character, and on that footing recommended him to my Protection. All the World knows, that M. Diderot is incapable of giving, to any body, a false Recommendation: But I am sensible, that to me he wou'd not give one that was not solid and well weigh'd. I believe, when you consider this Circumstance, you will be sensible, that you cou'd scarce engage with one, whose Recommendation can so much be depended on.

 I am, tho' unknown, Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant,



David Hume.
