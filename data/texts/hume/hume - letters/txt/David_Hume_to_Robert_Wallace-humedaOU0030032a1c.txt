[Edinburgh early 1753]

Sir

You are certainly in the right in what you say with regard to the Wines of France. There is a very good Passage to your Purpose in Matchiavel had you fallen upon it. He says, that Flanders is so cold a Country that it will not produce Corn, and that it is dependant on France for its Bread. This proves how ignorant an Italian may be, even in modern times, when the Communication is supposed more open, of what passes in the northern Parts of Europe. The Passage, I think is, in his Ritratto della Francia. If you find it there & think it to your Purpose, I very fairly lend it you. You know I am in your Debt.

 I am Sir Yours

D. H.
