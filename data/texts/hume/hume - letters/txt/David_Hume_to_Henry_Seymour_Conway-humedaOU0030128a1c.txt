Paris 3d of November 1765.

Sir

I came to Paris two days ago, upon Mr Walpole's Information, that the Duke of Richmond was expected that day: I find his Grace has put off his Journey a day or two longer than he intended.

The day before I left Fontainebleau, I presented the enclos'd Memorial to the Duke of Praslin, who gave me all the Reason in the World, to expect that Justice will be done in the Case. It will however be call'd a Favour; because they have a very absurd and tyrannical Law in this Country, that a Child of seven Years old may be converted, and may be taken from its Parents and Tutors under that Pretence.

The Dauphin is at present confin'd to his bed, and it is impossible to transport him to Versailles; so that the Court is to remain at Fontainebleau all this Winter. I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Regard, Sir

Your Excellency's

Most obedient and most humble Servant 
David Hume
