Dear Sir

There is a Matter, which I always intended to mention to you, and which I always forgot; and I believe it is better to do it, by way of Epistle, as it will serve to keep you in mind of it. It is this: There is a young Gentleman of the Name of Riddal, Grandson of Sir Walter Riddal, who goes with you in your nautical & philosophical Expedition in the Station of a Midshipman: I am much connected with his Friends who desire to have him recommended to you. I shoud be much oblig'd to you if you woud be so good as to take notice of the young Man; and if you find him worthy of your Friendship (as I hear him very well spoke of) that you woud show him all the Countenance that lies in your way: As you are naturally inclin'd to do good Offices, I need not amplify any farther this Recommendation. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient Servant
