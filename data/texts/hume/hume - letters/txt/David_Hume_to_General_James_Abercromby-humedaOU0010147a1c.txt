Dear Sir

This will be deliver'd you by Mr William Cockburn, a Friend of mine, who travels to London for the first time. I have taken the Opportunity to send up by him a Manuscript, which I intend to have printed. I have order'd him first to read it to you; but not to trust it out of his Hands. You can scarce be surpriz'd that I treat Mr Fraser so roughly in it. No Man, who loves his Country, can be a Friend to that Gentleman, considering his late, as well as former, Behaviour: For if I be rightly inform'd, his Conduct shows no more the Spirit of Submission & Tranquillity than that of Prudence & Discretion; & if he goes on at this Rate, you yourself will be oblig'd to renounce all Connexion & Friendship with him.

I have been ill of late; & am very low at present from the Loss of Blood, which they have drawn from me. My Friends wou'd hinder me from reading; but my Books and my Pen are my only Comfort & Occupation: And while I am master of a Drop of Blood or of Ink, I will joyfully spill it in the Cause of my Country.

 I am Dear Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant



David Hume.
