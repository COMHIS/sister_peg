Dear Sir

Certainly it is impossible for any body to object to this Scheme of a Book; and he must be very captious indeed who woud pretend to find fault with it. I return it with many Thanks for your Goodness in allowing me to peruse it. I shoud have returnd it sooner; but really it is wrote in so small a hand, that it was with Difficulty I coud read it, and it was some time before I cou'd fully decypher it. I beg my Compliments to your Son; and I am very sincerely Dear Sir

 Your most obedient and most humble 
Servant
