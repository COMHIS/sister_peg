Sir

Since my other Letter was put into the Post house, I made the Clerks of the Office search more exactly. They found your Letter so spoilt by Rain Water, that the Direction was not legible: And the corrected Sheet, Letter Z, was entirely spoilt. I must therefore beg of you to send me another Copy of that Sheet: As also a Copy of Sheet R, which I have never yet receivd. Please order the enclosd half Sheet to be inserted in the Manuscript, at the proper Place. I am Yours

D H
