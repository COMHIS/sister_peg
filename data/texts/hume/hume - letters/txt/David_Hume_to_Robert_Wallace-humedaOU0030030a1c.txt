Sir

I receiv'd your very obliging Letter. The Discourses are at present in the Press, & will be publish'd as soon as they are printed off & sufficiently dry; which I fancy will require two or three Months. Mr Kincaid, who is printing them, will best be able to inform you. Why cannot all the World entertain different Opinions about any Subject, as amicably as we do?

 I am Sir 
Your most obedient humble Servant
