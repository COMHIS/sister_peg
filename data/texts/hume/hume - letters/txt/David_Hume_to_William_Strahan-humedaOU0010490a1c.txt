Dear Sir,

I see sometimes Made Riccoboni, who is extremely surpriz'd, that Mr Becket answers none of her Letters, sends her none of the Copies which she bespoke, informs her nothing of the Success of her Book, and in short takes no manner of Notice of her. I beseech you make him write, or write yourself for him, if he continues obstinately negligent. I owe Mr Becket three Pounds, which I shall either pay him in London, or pay Mde Riccoboni for him, in case the Success of her book has been such, as to entitle her to any Recompence. You or Becket may write her in English. Her Direction is Rue Poisonniere au dela le boulevard. I am somewhat in a hurry, which will apologize for the Shortness of my Letter. I am always much oblig'd to you, when you have Leizure to write to me; being very sincerely Dear Sir

 Your most obedient Servant

David Hume.
