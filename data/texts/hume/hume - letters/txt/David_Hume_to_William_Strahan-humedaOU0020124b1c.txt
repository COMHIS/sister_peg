[? 10 March 1767.]

Dear Sir

I spoke to Lord Hertford on Sunday Evening: I know not if what I said woud have any Influence; but he seemd to think, that the Determination of that Question woud depend on the Lords who had been active in conducting the Affair, viz: Marchmont, Sandes and Bautitout: I know not by what means you can have Access to them.

I send you a Volume of Olivet's Cicero at Mr Millar's Desire, who proposes instantly to begin an Edition of my Essays in that Form, as a Forerunner to the like Edition of my History. Let us see a Sample of your English Press: I do not believe you can make such a Book; and I give you a Defiance. Pray return the Book carefully, after you have carefully survey'd it.

If Becket has a few Copies to spare of the French Edition of my Controversy with Rousseau, I shoud be glad to have three or four of them.

There was a good pleasant Paper, inserted, I believe in your Chronicle, about three months ago. It containd Rousseau's Articles of Charge against me, and then some good humourd Raillery against him and Voltaire and me. I should be glad to have two or three Copies of it, if you can readily find them.

I know not if Becket printed Voltaire's Letter to me, but if he did he may perhaps have two or three Copies to spare, which woud oblige me.

 I am Dr Sir Yours sincerely

D. H.
