Lisle-Street, Leicester Fields 17 of May, 1766.

Dear Sir,

It is very remarkable, that at the same instant when Mr. Rousseau appears to you in so good humour, he represents himself to General Conway as overwhelmed with the deepest affliction on account of some most unexpected misfortune; and he even says that his profound melancholy deprives him, for the time, of the use of his understanding. You will also think it more remarkable if I tell you, that he has refused the king's bounty, though he had allowed me to collect it, had allowed Mr. Conway to apply for it, had wrote to Lord Mareschal to obtain his consent for accepting it, and had given me authority to notify this consent to Mr. Conway; and though in all this affair he may seem to have used the king ill, and Mr. Conway and Lord Mareschal, and me, above all, he makes no apology for this conduct, and never writes me a word about it. So singular and odd he is in all his caprices. But we must allow him to have his own way; and as he has never spoke of the matter to you, it will be impossible for you to enter into it.

I send you enclosed a letter wrote to me by Monsieur Peyrou, his great friend at Neufchatel, who seems to me a man of merit. You will see by it that M. Rousseau is entirely satisfied with the reception you have given him.

I shall not fail to profit of the kind invitation which you are pleased to give me.

 I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant,



David Hume

P.S. I have wrote to M. Rousseau this post under the same cover with yours.
