Tuesday Morning [5 March 1765].

On Saturday last, I called at poor Madam D'Arti's, and received for answer at the door that she was better, and that there were great hopes of her recovery. I did not hear of her death till Sunday evening. I find it gives general concern, both to those who did know, and to those who did not know her. I came yesterday afternoon to tender my compliments to you and to the Prince of Conti, when I heard of your departure for the country. If the Prince of Conti thinks of staying at L'Isle-Adam beyond this week, I shall certainly pay my respects there, to you and to His Highness. I beg of you to assure him, that I take sincerely a part in his afflictions, especially that for a person, whom I knew to be possessed of so much merit. It is needless for me to inform you, how much every thing that interests you is and ever will be the object of my concern.
