[. . .] I am not surpriz'd, that you are displeas'd with what I have done with regard to Jean-Jaques: I am not pleas'd with it myself. But reflect, that properly speaking I have done nothing: I only gave a discretionary Power to my Friends at Paris to act as they thought proper; because I consider'd, that they were  from their Situation much better judges  than myself of the Propriety & Necessity of the Step I took. I forsaw, that many wou'd doubt of the Propriety of my Conduct: But I was told, that many, from want of Information, believ'd me to have been a Calumniator and a false perfidious Friend. You will own, that there was no Proportion between the one blame & the other.

You may remember, that there were two pieces publishd in the News pap[ers] of which this Madman accuses me of being the Author; and with regard to the last he says, that he has an intimate and certain Conviction of it. He says they were Libels against him. I cou'd reply nothing but that I had never seen nor read those Pieces. Above a Fortnight ago, I had a Letter from a Swiss Gentleman, who resides in London, one D'yverdun, a man of Character as I am told: For I never saw him nor heard of him before. This Gentleman informs me, that he was very much surprizd to meet with this Passage in Rousseau's Letter to me: For that he was the Author of the two Pieces; and is willing to acknowlege it to all the World And he gives me leave, in my own Justification, to publish his Letter in any of the public Papers, if I think proper. I sent a Copy of it to Mr Davenport to be delivered to Rousseau, but shall not print it; because I do not think that any body pretends to justify my Adversary or to blame me; and any farther Apology seems to be superfluous: I have besides a mortal Aversion to these Publications.
