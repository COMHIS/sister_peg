Dear Sir

In this day's Paper there is the inclosed Advertisement. You may easily believe it surprized me and others of your friends who knew that you had absolutely insisted with the French that nothing should be published in your life time and that you left London fixed in this resolution.

Many People will ask me if this Publication in France was made at your desire or with your Consent. Enable me therefore my Dear Sir, to give the answer you would do yourself were you on the Spot.

I suspect Rousseau has, by some letters to his friends at Paris and in Switzerland, provoked you to suffer his Paris Foes to indulge their first inclination for I can hardly suppose such men would be base enough to do it without your permission after the strong injunctions you had laid them under. . . .
