Sir

[You will receive, along with this, a Copy of the first Volume of my History of Great Britain, which will be publish'd next Winter in London.] The Honor, which you did me in translating my political Discourses, inspires me with an Ambition of desiring to have my History of Great Britain translated by the same excellent hand. The great Curiosity of the Events, related in this Volume, embellish'd by your elegant Pen, might challenge the Attention of the Public. If you do not undertake this Translation, I despair of ever seeing it done in a satisfactory manner. Many Intricacies in the English Government, many Customs peculiar to this Island, require Explication; and it will be necessary to accompany the Translation, with some Notes, however short, in order to render it intelligible to foreigners. None but a Person, so well acquainted as you with England and the English Constitution, can pretend to clear up Obscurities, or explain the Difficulties, which occur. If at any time you find Yourself at a loss, be so good as to inform me: I shall spare no Pains to solve all Doubts, and convey all the Lights which, by my long and assiduous Study of this Subject, I may have acquir'd. The Distance betwixt us need be no Impediment to this Correspondence. [If you favor me frequently with your Letters, I shall be able to render you the same Service as if I had the Happiness of living next door to you, and was able to inspect the whole Translation. In this Attempt the Knowledge of the two Languages is but one Circumstance to qualify a man for a Translator. Tho' your Attainments, in this Respect, be known to all the World, I own, that I trust more to the Spirit of Reflection and Reasoning which you discover; and] I thence expect, that my Performance will not only have Justice done it, but will even receive considerable Improvements, as it passes thro' your hands.

I am, with great Regard, Sir 
Your most obedient & most humble Servant



David Hume.
