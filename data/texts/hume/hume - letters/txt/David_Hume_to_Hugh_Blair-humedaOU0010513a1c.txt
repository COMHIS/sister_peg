Mr Hume desires to be remember'd by Dr Blair, and desires it very seriously. He was much satisfy'd with the Appendix to the critical Dissertation, which he always admir'd extremely. Tell Dr Robertson that the Dauphin ask'd Mr Hume several Questions t'other day about him & his History. That Prince seems a reasonable Man, but woud be the better of being roasted sometimes in the Poker. If they will elect him a Member, Mr Hume will propose it to him. What does the Dr say at present to these great folding Doors opend to all the Chimeras of Ambition? Alas! they may be thrown open much wider, if possible. None of these Chimeras will enter. Philosophy with her severe Brows guards the Passage; while Indolence, in affright, is ready to throw herself out at the Window. Mr Hume recommends himself to Ferguson and Jardine and John Adams, and Mrs Adams, and to all the Poker, and desires the Prayers of the Faithful for him on this Occasion.
