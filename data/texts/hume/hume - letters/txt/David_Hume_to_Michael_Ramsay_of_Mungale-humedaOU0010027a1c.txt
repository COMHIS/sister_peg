Feby. 22 [1739]

Dear Michael

This is the fourth Letter I have wrote you, since you left London. The failing of the former will make me more concise in this. I shall only repeat what I told you at large, that as far as I can judge you stand very well with all my L Marchmont's Family, & may depend upon their Friendship as much as ever. I expect every hour to have a Call from a Ship to go to Scotland; but shall endeavour to meet with some of the Family before I go, in order to consult with them about your Affairs, & consider whether your Absence will not be a prejudice to you. You shall hear of it in the Postscript. In the mean time I must declare it as my Opinion, that nothing can be done effectually without your presence; tho' I think this can be no reason for your leaving Mr Home, since the Difference will only be of a few Months.

As to myself, no Alteration has happen'd in my Fortune, nor have I taken the least Step towards it. I hope things will be riper next Winter; & I wou'd not aim at any thing till I cou'd judge of my Success in my grand Undertaking, & see upon what footing I shall stand in the World. I am afraid, however, that I shall not have any great Success of a sudden. Such Performances make their way very heavily at first, when they are not recommended by any great Name or Authority.

I do not despair but some of my former Letters may yet reach you; for which reason I shall repeat nothing, but what I must always repeat to you; that I am with the greatest Sincerity Your affectionate Friend

D. H.

I have had a Conversation with Mr Hume since I wrote this. He is entirely of my Opinion, that nothing can be done till you be on the place. For shou'd a Living fall in the Gift of the Dutchess of Marlborough or any other of your Friends, & Patrons, 'twou'd have but an ill Air to say, that the Gentleman was in the South of France, & that he shoud be inform'd of the Matter. Besides you know, how necessary a Man's Presence is to quicken his Friends, to make them unite their Interests; & to save them the Trouble of contriving & thinking about his Affairs. Many a one may endeavour to serve you, when you point out the Service you desire of them, who wou'd not take the [?Pains] of finding it out themselves.

I saw My Lord Polwarth; but he was with some great Folks, who carry'd him away, & did not give me an opportunity of speaking to him. I think it were proper you shou'd write to my Lord to inform [him] that you have left the Commissions of Wine in a Friend's hand w[hom] you wou'd write to, if his Ldp woud please to inform you. For [to] desire him to write himself to a Person he does not know, I do [not] think so proper.

My kind Service to Mr Home; & let him know how great Joy his R[ecovery] has given me & all his Friends here. A propos My Lord Home is at [?] of a petition to the Parliament agst My Lord Marchmont about th[e Sherriff] Court. My Lord spoke to me with great Resentment of it; but upon [my] mentioning something of our Friend he said there was all the Diff[erence] in the World betwixt the two Brothers, & that Mr Home seem'd to be [the finest] Boy in the World. By this you may see, that so far from involving you in these Quarrels, they even distinguish betwixt the two Brothers. [I have] inform'd you of other particulars in former Letters.
