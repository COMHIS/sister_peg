Mr Hume asks Mr Strahan ten thousand Pardons: When Mr Strahan was so kind as to ask him to dine with him on Monday, he was already engagd several days before, but had forgot it. Meeting yesterday with the Gentleman, he put him in mind of it, and insisted that the prior Engagement was to him. So that he hopes Mr Strahan will be so good as to excuse him.

 Sunday [? February 1767.]
