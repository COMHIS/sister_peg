My Lord

I was yesterday at Sion Hill, where Lord and Lady Holderneſse told me, that your Lordship had expreſsed yourself to them as under some Difficulty to find a proper Person, skilld in the French Language, whom you might carry over with you as private Secretary to Paris. I told them, that such a one had applyd to me, and desird my Recommendation to your Lordship; but that I had not sufficiently the Honour of your Acquaintance to enable me to use that Freedom. They desird me, therefore, to employ their Name. The Gentleman is call'd Deyverdun: He is a Swiſs by birth, and of a good Family, as M. Dayrolles informd me, whose Relation he is. He is at this time in the Secretary of State's Office, in Lord Weymouths Department and it was there I had an Opportunity of being acquainted, and have conceved a great Esteem for him. He is a young Man of Knowledge and Sence, very modest and well behavd, and of xx unreproachable Morals. He understands English sufficiently and French is his native Language. I thought it might be of great Advantage to the young Man to be introducd to your Lordship; and he might also xx be of Use to you in your Embaſsy. I would not therefore allow a false Modesty to on my part to be perhaps hurtful to both. ——— I have the Honour to be My Lord

Your Lordships most obedient & 
most humble Servant
