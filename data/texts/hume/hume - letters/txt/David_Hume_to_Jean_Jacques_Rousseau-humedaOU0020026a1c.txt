Dear Sir

I am desired by Lady Ailesbury and General Conway to propose to you to do them the Favour of dining with them to morrow, along with Mlle le Vasseur. If you accept, Mr Davenport's Coach will bring you to Town before Dinner, with all your Baggage. If you decline the Invitation, from whatever Reason, I shall endeavour to make your excuses. It is not necessary, that you constrain Yourself the least in this Affair. I am Yours, with great Sincerity

David Hume
