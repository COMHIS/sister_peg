[Edinburgh Spring of 1775.]

. . . I see by the Gazette, that he is now a Lieutenant. I suppose you have been so good as to advance the Money to the Agent. My Intention was that the Fees of the Commission shoud also be advanced to him; and I shoud be glad to know the Amount of the whole. I suppose, that the whole Money, which you have advanced by my Order, exceeds my Money in your hands; and you may either draw on me for the Ballance at sight, or wait till my funds shall re-imburse you. I am Dear Sir

 Your most obedient humble Servant

David Hume
