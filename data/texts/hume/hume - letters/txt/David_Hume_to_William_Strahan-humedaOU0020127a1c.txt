Dear Strahan

I have been so happy as to prevail in my Applications both to Lord Hertford and to General Conway: I doubt not but Charles Townsend will be favourable to you. Pray, are you thinking of this new Dress in which you promis'd to put me? Shall I pretend to rival Cicero in Garb and Accoutrements.

 Yours

D. H.
