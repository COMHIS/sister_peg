Sir

I receiv'd your obliging Letter, which wou'd give me a great deal of Vanity, were I not sensible, that I owe your good Opinion more to your good Nature than the Severity of your Judgement.

The agreeable Vein of Poetry, which you have discover'd; had given me a Curiosity to enjoy your Acquaintance; & it is with Pleasure I lay hold of the Opportunity, which offers. You will therefore very much oblige me, if you will favor me with your Company, the first time you are abroad. I am always at home in the Forenoons, & often in the Afternoon.

The Preface you sent me is really very well wrote; & it was not easily possible to do it better. However I have us'd the Freedom of making some small Alterations: I wish it were in my Power to do you any more material Service; & I shall lay hold of every such Opportunity with Pleasure.

 I am Sir Your most obedient Servant
