⟨Edinburgh 26 Feb. 1753⟩

Sir

I have not had an Opportunity of meeting with you, in order to give you Thanks for the agreeable Present, which you have made me. When my political Discourses were publish'd, I ordered the Bookseller to send you a Copy, which he neglected. Permit me at present to execute my Intention. You have a Copy, in which I had bound some Sheets of Paper, with a View of writing any Alterations I shoud make for a new Edition; and on the Margin I had already made a few. Your Work has convinc'd me, that I must make a great many Alterations, and I find I shall have great Use for these Sheets. I must therefore use the Liberty to beg of you, that you wou'd send me.

 I am Sir 
Your most oblig'd humble Servant
