Edinburgh 6th March, 1753

Dear Doctor,

This is delivered to you by my friend Mr Wedderburn, who makes a jaunt to London, partly with a view to study, partly to entertainment. I thought I could not do him a better office, nor more suitable to both these purposes, than to recommend him to the freindship and acquaintance of a man of learning and conversation. He is young,

Mais dans les âmes bien nées 
La vertue n'attend point le nombre des années.



It will be a great obligation, both to him and me, if you give him encouragement to see you frequently; and, after that, I doubt not you will think that you owe me an obligation —

La in giovenile corpo senile senno.

But I will say no more of him, lest my letter fall into the same fault which may be remarked in his behaviour and conduct in life; the only fault which has been remarked in them, that of promising so much that it will be difficult for him to support it. You will allow that he must have been guilty of some error of this kind, when I tell you that the man, with whose friendship and company I have thought myself very much favoured, and whom I recommend to you as a friend and companion, is just twenty.

 I am, dear Doctor, your affectionate friend and servant,

David Hume
