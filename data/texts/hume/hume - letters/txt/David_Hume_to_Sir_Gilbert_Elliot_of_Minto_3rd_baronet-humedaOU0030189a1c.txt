We know not which to admire most the Spirit and Vigour of the King or the Weakness of the Duke of Grafton. As I had renounced the World, I did not think it had been possible for any public Business to have interested me so much as I am against the Success of those Banditti. I also Envy the Lot of that Historian, who is to transmit to Posterity an account of these mad abandon'd times. It must make very amusing Reading.

I interrupt you no longer than just to mention again the Kirk of Roberton.

 I am dear [Elliot] 
Yours sincerely
