Edinburgh 28 of Jany 1772

Dear Smith

I shoud certainly, before this time, have challengd the Performance of your Promise, of being with me about Christmas, had it not been for the Misfortunes of my Family. Last Month, my Sister fell dangerously ill of a Fever; and though the Fever be now gone, she is still so weak and low, and recovers so slowly, that I was afraid it woud be but a melancholy House to invite you to. However, I expect, that time will re-instate her in her former Health, in which case, I shall look for your Company. I shall not take any Excuse from your own State of Health, which I suppose only a Subterfuges invented by Indolence and Love of Solitude. Indeed, my Dear Smith, if you continue to hearken to Complaints of this Nature, you will cut Yourself out entirely from human Society, to the great Loss of both Parties.

The Lady's Direction is Me la Comtesse de B. Douairiere au Temple. She has a Daughter in law, which makes it requisite to distinguish her

 Yours sincerely

David Hume

P.S.

I have not yet read Orlando inamorato; but intend soon to do it. I am now in a course of reading the Italian Historians, and am confirmd in my former Opinion that that Language has not producd one Author who knew how to write elegant, correct Prose, though it contains several excellent Poets. You say nothing to me of your own work.
