Toulouse, 4 Nov. 1764

My dear friend,

This letter will be delivered to you by Mr Urquhart, the only man I ever knew that had a better temper than yourself. You will find him most perfectly amiable. I recommend him in the most earnest manner to your advice and protection. He is not a man of letters and is just a plain, sensible, agreeable man of no pretentions of any kind, but whom you will love everyday better and better. I ever am

My Dear Friend, Most faithfully yours 
Adam Smith
