Edinburgh 6 of August 1772

Dear Strahan

Having mentiond to Sir Robert Keith how useful and agreeable Lord Stormont and Sir Andrew Mitchel, as well as Lord Hertford and myself, found your Correspondence while abroad, he express'd the greatest Desire of enjoying the same Advantages while employd at Vienna, and beg'd my Interest with you to procure him the favour. I own, that I cou'd not perswade myself to refuse him in so earnest a Request, both because he is as worthy and agreeable a Man as I know, and my very good Friend. I also thought, that, tho' the Encrease of your Business leaves you less Leizure than formerly, this Occupation wou'd only be a Relaxation from your usual Labours, the same Information wou'd equally serve for Lord Stormont, and Sir Robert, and you cou'd not be displeas'd to contribute in this Shape to the public Service. For all these Reasons, I cannot forbear recommending Sir Robert to your Friendship and good Offices; and doubt not but your Correspondence will be agreeable to both: Tho' I own, that all the Advantages will be on his Side, while he is abroad, as the Trust repos'd in him, will not permit him to be equally communicative to you of the Transactions of his Department. I am very sincerely

 Dear Strahan 
Your most obedient humble Servant



David Hume
