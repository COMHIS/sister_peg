Thursday Morning [Feb. or March 1765.]

Madam

I was much surpriz'd to hear from the Baron d'Holbac, that the Printing of these two Volumes has been finished these six Weeks, all to two Sheets; and that he suspected the Delay proceeded from some Difficulty with regard to the Police. But if it is so, I think you wou'd have told me; and if it is not so, your Bookseller is certainly the most absurd and most negligent of all human Beings. I wish we cou'd fall on some method to rouze him from his Lethargy. If the Difficulty lies with the Police, I might fall on some way to remove it. I now say to every body, that I do not believe the Book will be publishd till next winter; if, then. Pray, be so good as to inform me of the present State of the Case. I have never seen any Printer or Bookseller of Yours to give Directions about Mde Geoffrins Copy. I am with great Truth & Sincerity Madam

 Your most obedient humble Servt

David Hume
