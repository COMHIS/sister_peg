My Dear Sir

I hope you always esteem yourself more oblig'd to me, when I send you Papers I do not approve of, than where I send you those I think more tolerable; since there may be a Share of Vanity in the latter Case, which can have no Part in the former. I have a strong Suspicion against the present Packet. One of the Papers will be found very cold; & the other be esteem'd somewhat sophystical. However I communicate them to you; because I may possibly be mistaken. I remember Boileau enumerating the Advantages which may be met with in consulting a judicious Friend concerning a man's Performances, says among other things

Lui seul eclair√ßira vos doutes ridicules 
De votre esprit tremblant levera les scrupules.



I thank your for your Manuscript, which I have scarce had Time to look into, being very late at Redbraes-Castle last Night, & being oblig'd to dispatch away this in the Morning. I am more & more convinc'd that Lady Jane's Advice will be serviceable to us; tho' I am afraid, that my Lord Marchmont's Arrival will deprive us of such easy Opportunitys of speaking to her as cou'd be wisht. He is expected in a few Days.

I have committed some Mistakes in former Papers by trusting to my Memory. I have met with the Story of Diogenes in Cicero told in a better way. I suppose that instead of the Hydrogynes, I shou'd have said the Androgynes of Plato.

I shall be in Town about the End of next Week. I suppose your Friends have been lazy the last Vacation, that I have not heard of them. I am 
Yours sincerely
