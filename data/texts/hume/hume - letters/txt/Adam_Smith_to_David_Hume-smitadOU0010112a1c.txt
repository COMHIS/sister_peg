Hotel du Parc Royale, Paris, 13 Mar. 1766

Dear Hume

I am much obliged to you for recommending your Servant to me. He is without exception the best I ever had in my life and I have always been very well serv'd. The main Purpose of this letter is to recommend the bearer to your Protection. He has served the Duke of Buccleugh with the most acknowledged fidelity ever since he came abroad, and has been driven out of his service by the jealousy and ill humour of Cook the Dukes Maitre d'Hotel. I will answer both for his honesty and his good nature which is such that I should have thought it impossible for any human creature to dislike him. He is very young and is upon that account thoughtless and sometimes negligent. His great perfection is as a travelling Servant. If it falls in your way easily, and without giving yourself any trouble, to recommend him to a proper place in England, you may perfectly depend upon his possessing all the above mentioned qualities in a very high degree. His name is David Challende he is a Suisse.

You are much wanted in Paris. Everybody I see enquires after the time of your return. Do not, however, for gods sake, think of settling in this country but let both of us spend the remainder of our days on the same side of the Water. Come, however, to Paris in the mean time and we shall settle the plan of our future life together. I ever am

My dear friend, yours 
A: Smith
