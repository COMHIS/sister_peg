. . . Rousseau is a sad and contemptible Creature. When he hears how much depended on you & what part you have acted in the affair of his Pension, I am perswaded he will have recourse to his Pills. He has nothing else left him. I shall be glad to know what you hear about him; Whether he is preparing any sort of War against you, or will sit down patient & contented under the Load of Infamy you have justly thrown upon him, or rather, which he has brought upon himself. . . .
