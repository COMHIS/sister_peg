Dear Sir

Yesterday, I was favour'd with Yours, which made me feel two very opposite passions; pleasure beyond expression to be assured by Yourself that what I had been told was not true; pain to a great degree at seeing Your superiority over me, in point of coolness and politeness. I shall always be overjoy'd to see You, but I flatter my self You will spare me the uneasyness I must necessarly suffer if You talk on a subject, I confess to You I have been so much in the wrong. I beg You will believe me as much as ever dear Sir

Your Most obedient and most humble Servant
