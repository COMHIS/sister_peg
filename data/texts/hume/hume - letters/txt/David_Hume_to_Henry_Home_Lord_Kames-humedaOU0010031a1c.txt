Ninewells Sunday, July 1, 1739.

My dear Sir,

I hope you always esteem yourself more obliged to me when I send you papers I do not approve of, than when I send you those I think more tolerable; since there may be a share of vanity in the latter case, which can have no part in the former. I have a strong suspicion against the present packet. One of the papers will be found very cold; and the other be esteemed somewhat sophistical. However, I communicate them to you; because I may possibly be mistaken. I remember Boileau enumerating the advantages which may be met with in consulting a judicious friend, concerning a man's performances, says, among other things,

Lui seul éclaircira vos doutes ridicules, 
De votre esprit tremblant levera les scrupules.



I thank you for your manuscript, which I have scarce had time to look into, being very late at Red-braes Castle last night, and being obliged to dispatch away this in the morning. — I have committed some mistakes in former papers by trusting to my memory. I have met with the story of Diogenes in Cicero told in a better way. I suppose, that instead of the Hydrogenes, I should have said the Androgynes of Plato. I suppose our friends have been lazy the last vacation, that I have not heard of them. I am yours sincerely,

David Hume.
