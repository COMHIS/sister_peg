Edinburgh. 27 May. 1756.

Dear Sir

I receivd Yours, with which I am very well satisfy'd: It requires no other Answer than to tell you, that I agree that the Edition be 1750, and inform you that the Number printed of fine Paper was 75 not 100, as you seem to suppose. I have no Objection to Mr Mitchels having a Copy of the Dissertations. I just saw John Balfour, who is very uneasy on account of a considerable Number of Copies of the first Volume which Baillie Hamilton had ordered to be bound. This seems to have been very ill advis'd, and I own embarasses me not a little. For I desire to do him all the Service possible. But this must be the Object of Deliberation some time afterwards. I am Dear Sir

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.

P.S.

I write this at present, that you may adjust precisely with Mr Strahan the Number of each kind of Paper before the Sheet be returnd from me.
