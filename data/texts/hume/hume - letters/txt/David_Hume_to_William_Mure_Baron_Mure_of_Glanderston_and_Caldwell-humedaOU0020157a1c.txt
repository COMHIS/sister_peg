[London, end of July 1767]

Dear Baron

It will be some time before Lord Hertford come to a Resolution because he does not expect to see Lord Harcourt soon, and till then he shall not be able to know who they were that recommended Graffigni. In my Conversation with your young Folks yesterday, I endeavoured to inform myself concerning their Progress in Latin. I find that they are not taught any Latin Grammar: They are only instructed in the Sense of single detachd Words, which they learn both in Greek and Latin at once: Accordingly they told me Water, aqua, and ὕδωρ but tho' I tryd them in about half a dozen more Words, I coud not find their Learning extended so far. All this appears to me very whimsical; and I doubt a dead Language can never be learnt in this manner without Grammar. In a living Language the continual Application of the Words and Phrazes teaches at the same time the Sense of the Words and their Reference to each other; but a List of Words got by heart, without any connected Sense, easily escapes the Memory, and is but a small Part of the Language. But tho' I suspect this Man in general to be empty and conceited, as your boys are so very young, their time is not very precious; and provided they be well in point of Health and Morals or rather manners (which seem to me unexceptionable) you may allow them to remain there some time without Anxiety. I am deliberating myself about my Nephews; and shall communicate to you the Result of my Enquiries and Reflections. Yours

D. Hume.
