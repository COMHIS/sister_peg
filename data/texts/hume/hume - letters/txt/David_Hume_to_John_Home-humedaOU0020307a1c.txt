Edinburgh 8th February, 1776.

Dear Tyrtæus,

It is a remark of Dr Swift's, that no man in London ever complained of his being neglected by his friends in the country. Your complaint of me is the more flattering.

Two posts ago, I received, under a frank of General Fraser's, a pamphlet, entitled A Letter from An Officer Retired. It is a very good pamphlet; and I conjecture you to be the author. Sallust makes it a question, whether the writer or the performer of good things has the preference? and he ascribes the greater praise to the latter. It is happy for you, that you may rest your fame on either. I here allude to what you have done for Ferguson.

But, pray, why do you say, that the post of Boston is like the camp of Pirna? I fancy our troops can be withdrawn thence without any difficulty.

I make no doubt, since you sound the trumpet for war against the Americans, that you have a plan ready for governing them, after they are subdued; but you will not subdue them, unless they break in pieces among themselves — an event very probable. It is a wonder it has not happened sooner. But no man can foretell how far these frenzies of the people may be carried.

 Yours

David Hume
