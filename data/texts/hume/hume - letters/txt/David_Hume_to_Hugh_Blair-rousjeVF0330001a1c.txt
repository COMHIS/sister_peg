1st April 1767

. . . I send you a Pamphlet, which was published near three Months ago; but I never heard of it till last week, nor saw it till two days ago. Neither Mr. Walpole nor I knew anything of the Author; tho' I am told the public ascribed it to himself, which he positively denies, and I entirely acquit him, tho the piece is not ill-wrote. . . .
