[London ?18 May 1768]

Dear Sir

On coming home last Night, I found a Letter which renders it impossible for me to wait on you Tuesday next: But I shall be at your Command any other day. As you are now well enough to go abroad, and seem even, by your last Accounts, to have a superabundance of Health, I think we had better, all of us, meet at Howel's; and I shall make one whenever you shall give me warning.I am Dear Sir

 Yours sincerely

David Hume
