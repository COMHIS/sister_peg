[. . .] I did not answer Yours, which Oswald delivered me; because I take it for granted that you receivd mine, which I wrote from Paris, under Lord Kaims's Cover. You have seen in the News-papers enow of Particulars concerning my Pupil, who has now left me and retir'd to Chiswick. He is impatient to get into the Mountains of Wales. He is a very agreeable, amiable Man; but a great Humourist. The Philosophers of Paris fortold to me, that I could not conduct him to Calais without a Quarrel; but I think I cou'd live with him all my Life, in mutual Friendship and Esteem. I am very sorry, that the Matter is not likely to be put to a Trial. I believe one great Source of our Concord, is, that neither he nor I are disputatious, which is not the Case with any of them. They are also displeas'd with him, because  they think he over-abounds in Religion; and it is indeed remarkable, that the Philosopher of this Age, who has been the most persecuted, is by far the most devout. I do not comprehend such Philosophers as are invested with the sacerdotal Character. I am Dear Dr Yours usque ad aras
