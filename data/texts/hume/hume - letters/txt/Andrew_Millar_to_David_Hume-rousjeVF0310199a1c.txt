Dear Sir

I am quite Satisfied of yr good Intentions to me by yours of the 8th but what I foresaw has happened for Several of our mutual friends asked me yesterday if there was any difference between us as many notes points out in the Translation yr knowledge and concern in it. Being aware of this I wrote Mr Strahan desiring no gain from it, only desired my name might be put to the Translation w₶ he thought reasonable, but his Partner Mr Becket absolutely refused it, and ye may easily believe I wd not ask him a 2d time, Such is the ingratitude of Some who on many occasions I have oblidged and Served, and who even at this time owes me money and has for many years. But I scorn to resent it by my doing either of them the least injury, and I am truly glad that I have discovered his ingratitude before it was too late for him to injure me more Substantialy. The Sale will be much more than you imagine. One French edition allready printed here is allready sold, and I am told 750 of the Translation. Mankind in general are fond of mischief or quarrels, tho' a more absurd ridiculous one never appeared than this on the Side of Rousseau. He is mad wt Pride & self importance: I allways thought So, and I find every Person yt I converse wt of that opinion Dr Smith who lately arrived from Paris and is soon to be at Ed₶ : thinks it was not worth yr while to Publish . . . .
