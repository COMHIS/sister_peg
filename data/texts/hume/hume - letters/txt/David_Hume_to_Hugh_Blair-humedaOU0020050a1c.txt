My dear Sir

I cannot begin my Letter without lamenting most sincerely the Death of our Friend, Dr Jardine: I do not aggravate it by the Circumstance of its being sudden; for that is very desirable: But surely we shall ever regreat the Loss of a very pleasant Companion and of a very friendly honest Man. It makes a blank which you must all feel, and which I in particular will sensibly feel, when I come amongst you. I need not ask you, whether the Miscreants of the opposite Party did not rejoice. For I take it for granted.

As soon as I receiv'd yours, I put it into Mr Dodwell's hands, who said that he woud deliberate with his Wife about it. I did not hear of him till to day, when he told me, that he desir'd much to settle his Son with Dr Drysdale, and woud give a hundred a Year with him, beginning with the first of November next. I told him, that I wishd he had informd me sooner, for I was afraid, that it woud be too late for Dr Drysdale to find a House. I added, that you had desird in your Letter to have an Answer immediatly: He told me, that he had not observed that Clause. I beseech you to engage Dr Drysdale, if it be possible, to take the Boy on these Terms. I am Dear Sr

 Yours sincerely

David Hume.
