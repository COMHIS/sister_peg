Dear Sir

I have here fallen upon a great Treasure, as I believe, of historical Knowledge; which is, 15 Volumes of the late K. James's Memoirs wrote all with his own hand. I shall be able to make use of them for improving & correcting many Passages of my History, in case of a new Edition; which however I fancy will not be soon. I am glad to see public Affairs likely to settle in favour of Government. No body ever led a more dissipated Life than I do here. Please send to Mr Stewart in Buckingham Street six Copies of the new Edition of my History; and two of the last large Paper Quarto, all in Sheets. Make them carefully up in a Parcel: He is to send them to me. I shall be your Debtor for the Quartos. I shoud be glad to hear from you. My Direction is at the English Ambassadors. Excuse my Hurry. I beg my Compliments to Mrs Millar. I am very sincerly

 Dear Sir 
Your most humble Servant
