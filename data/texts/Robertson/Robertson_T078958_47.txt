T HE original plan of my Father, the

late Dr. Robertson, with refpedt

to the History of America, compre-
hended not only an account of the
discovery of that country, and of the
conquests and colonies of the Spa-
niards, but embraced also the history
of the Britifi and Portuguese Establish-
ments in the New World, and of the
Settlements made by the several na-
tions of Europe in the Weft India
Jflands. It was his intention not to
have published any part of the Work
until the whole was completed. In
the Preface to his History of America,
he has flated the reasons which in-
duced him to depart from that refolu-
tion, and to publish the Two Volumes
which contain an account of the dif-
covery of the New World, and of the

a progress

[ vi ]

progress of the Spanifi arms and colo-
nies in that quarter of the globe. He
fays, "he had made some progress in
the Hiflory of British America;" and he
announces his intention to return to
that part of his Work, as soon as the
ferment which at that tine prevailed
in the British Colonies in America,
should subside, and regular govern-
ment be re-established. Various causes
concurred in preventing him from
fulfilling his intention.

DURING the course of a tedious ill-

ness, which he early foresaw would
have a fatal termination, Dr. Robertson
at different times destroyed many of
his papers. But after his death, I
found that part of the History of British
America which he had wrote many
years before, and which is now offered
to the Public. It is written with his
own hand, as all his Works were; it
is as carefully corrected as any part
of his Manuscripts which I have ever
seen; and he had thought it worthy

of

[ vii ]

of being preserved, as it escaped the
flames to which so many other papers
had been committed. I read it with
the utmost attention; but, before I
came to any resolution about the
publication, I put the MS. into the
hands of some of those friends whom
my Father used to consult on such
occasions, as it would have been rash-
ness and presumption in me to have
trusted to my own partial decision. It
was perused by some other persons
also, in whose taife and judgment I
have the greatest confidence: by all of
them I was encouraged to offer it to
the Public, as a fragment curious and
interefling in itself, and not inferior
to any of my Father's Works.

WHEN I determined to follow that

advice, it was a circumitance of great
weight with me, that as I never could
think myself at liberty to destroy those
papers which my Father had thought
worthy of being preserved, and as I

could

[ viii ]

could not know into whose hands they
might hereafter fall, I confidered it
as certain that they would be published
at some future period, when they
might meet with an Editor, who, not
being acuated by the fame sacred
regard for the reputation of the Au-
thor which I feel, might make altera-
tions and additions, and obtrude the
whole on the Public as a genuine and
authentic work. The MS. is now pub-
lifhed, such as it was left by the Author;
nor have I presumed to make any ad-
dition, alteration, or correAion what.
ever.

T America are next in extent to those Ix
of Spain. Its acquisitions there are a re- sadit o
compence due to those enterprising talents awakened

in Eng-

which prompted the English to enter early land by
on the career of discovery, and to pursue columd,^
-it with persevering ardour. England was covcrics;
the second nation that ventured to visit the
*New Worid. The account of Columbma's
fucceifful voyage filled all Europe with
aftonihment and admiration. But in.Eng-
land it did something more it excited a

Ba Vehement

B o O K vehement desire of emulating the glory of

X. Spain, and of aiming to obtain some share

in those advantages which were expeced in
this new field opened to national acivity.
The attention of the English court had been
turned towards the discovery of unknown
countries, by its negociation with Bartho-
lemew Columbus. Henry VII. having lif-
tened to his propoftions with a more fa-
vourable ear than could have been expeced
from a cautious, distrustful prince, averse by
habit as well as by temper to new and ha-
zardous projedts, he was more easily in-
luced to approve of a voyage for discovery,
proposed by some of his own fubjeds, loon
after the return of Christopher Columbus.

checked BUT though the Engliffh had spirit to
,tLinsin form this scheme, they had not, at that pe-

aviga-- riod, attained to Iuch skill in navigation as
Uton;

qualified them for carrying it into execution.
From the inconsiderate ambition of its mo-
narchs, the nation had long wafted its genius
aud activity in pernicious and ineffeaual

efforts

efforts to conquer France. When this ill- B O K
directed ardour began to abate, the fatal -
contest between the houses of York and
Lancaster turned the arms of one half of
the kingdom against the other, and exhault-
ed the vigour of both. During the course
of two centuries, while industry and com-
merce were making gradual progress, both
in the south and north of Europe, the
Englilh continued so blind to the advan-
tages of their own situation, that they
hardly began to bend their thoughts to-
wards those objecs and pursuits, to which
they are indebted for their present opulence
and power. While the trading vessels of
Italy, Spain, and Portugal, as well as those
of the Hans Towns, visited the most re-
mote ports in Europe, and carried on an
active intercourse with its various nations,
the English did little more than creep along
their own coasts, in small barks, which con-
veyed the productions of one county to an-
other. Their commerce was almost wholly
paflive. Their wants were supplied by

X3 2 trangers;

B O O K ifrangers; and whatever necessary or luxury

IX.
e__y of life their own country did not yield, was

imported in foreign bottoms. The cross of
St. George was seldom displayed beyond the
precincts of the narrow seas. Hardly any
E-nglish {hip traded with Spain or Portugal,
before the beginning of the fifteenth cen-
tury; and half a century more elapsed be-
fore the Englifl mariners became so advcn-
turous as to enter the Mediterranean.

.3i,- IN this infancy of navigation, IIenry

tion from
Briol, could not commit the condu& of an arma-
tnder the meit, destined to explore unknown regi-
command
of Cabut. ons, to his own fubjeds. He invested Gio-

vanni Caboto, a Venetian adventurer, who
hlad Icttled int Bristol, with the chief com-
mand ; and issued a commifnion to him and
his three ions, empowering them to fail,
under the banner of England, towards the
cafn, north or weft, in order to discover
countries unoccupied by any Chriflian state;
to take potletfion of them in his name, and
to carry on an cxclufive trade with the in-

Il.i bitant;,

habitants, under condition of paying a fifth B o K

Ix.

part of the free profit on every voyage to ,
the crown. This commission was granted
on March Sth, 1495, in less than two years
after the return of Columbus from Ame-
rica *. But Cabot (for that is the name
ihe assumed ip England, and by which he
is best known) did not set out on his voy-
age for two years. He, together with his
second son Sebastian, embarked at Bristol, 1497.
on board a ship furnilhed by the king, and May.
was accompanied by four small barks, fitted
out by the merchants of that city.

,l- which Columbus had formed, with refped

to the islands which he had discovered, was
universally received. They were supposed
to lie contiguous to the great continent of
India, and to constitute a part of the vast
countries comprehended under that general
name. Cabot, accordingly, deemed it pro-
bable, that by steering to the north-well,
he might reach India by a ihorter course
than that which Columbus had taken, and
hoped to fall in with the coast of Cathay,
or China, of whose fertility and opulence
the descriptions of Marco Polo had excited
high ideas. After failing for some weeks
due weft, and nearly on the parallelof the
port from which he took his departure, he
discovered a large island, which he called
Prima Vifla, and his sailors Newforudland:;
and in a few days he descried a smaller
isle, to which he gave the name 'of St.
Ju;e 2... John. He landed on both there, made

iome obfcrvatiouis on their foil and pro-
ductions, and brought off three of the na-

tives.

soon reached the continent of North Ame- v -
rica, and failed aloqg it from the fifty-fixth
to the thirty-eighth degree of latitude,
from the coast of Labrador to that of Vir-
ginia. As his chief obje& was to dig
cover some inlet that might open a pafiage
to the weft, it does not appear that he
landed any where during this extensive run;
and he returned to England, without at-
tempting either settlement or conquest in
any part of that continent *.

turned to England,. he found both the state'.
of affairs and the king's inclination unfa;
vourable to 'ahy scheme the execution of
which would have required tranquillity and
leisure. Henry was involved in a war with

fition of the islands and continent which
Cabot had cifcovered, it was evident that
they lay within the limits of the ample
donative which the bounty of Alexan-
der VI. had conferred upon Ferdinand and
Ifabela. No person, in that age, queftione4
the validity of a papal grant; and Ferdi-

cflsrso such success in his first essay as might have

encouraged him to persevere. The ad-
vantages of commerce, as well as its na-
ture, were so little underltood in Eng-
land about this period, that by an ad
of parliament in the year 1488, the taking
of interest for the use of money was pro-

*Some schemes of difcovcry seem to have been

formed in England towards the beginning of the fix-
teenth century. But as there is no other memorial of
them, than what remains in a patent granted by the
king to the adventurers, it is probable that they were
feeble or abortive projets. If any attempt had been
made in concequence of this patent, it would not
have escaped the knowledge of a compiler so in-
duftrious and inquisitive as Hakluyt. In his patent,
Hlenry reftrits the adventurers from encroaching on
the countries discovered by the kings of Portugal, or
any other prince in confederacy with England. Ry.

ing in bills of exchange was condemned as *
favouring of ufiry . It is not surprising,
then, that no great effort should be made to
extend trade, by a nation whose commer-
cial ideas were fill so crude and illiberal.
But it is more difficult to discover what
prevented this scheme of Henry VII. from
being resumed during the reigns of his son
and grandson; and to give any reason why
no attempt was made, either to explore
the northern continent of America more
fully, or to fettle in it. Henry VIII. was
frequently at open enmity with Spain: the
value of the Spanish acquisitions in America
had become so well known, as might have
excited his desire to obtain some footing in
those opulent regions; and during a con-
fiderable part of his reign, the prohibitions
in a papal bull would not have refrained
him from making encroachment upon the
Spanish dominions. But the reign of

i- _ of discovery. During one period of 'it;

the active part which he took in the as-
fairs of the continent, and the vigour with
which he engaged in the contest between
the two mighty rivals, Charles V. and
Francis I., gave full occupation to the en-
terprifing spirit both of the king and of his
nobility. During another period of his ad-
ministration, his famous controvcrfy with
the court of Rome kept the nation in per-
petual agitation and suspense. Engrossed
by those objeas, neither the king nor the
nobles had inclination or leisure to turn
their attention to new pursuits; and with-
out their patronage and aid, the com.
mercial part of the nation was too in-
considerable to make any effort of con-
sequence. Though England, by its total
reparation from the church of Rome, soon
after the acceflion of Edward Vl., dif-
claimed that authority, which, by its pre,
sumptuous partition of the globe between
two favourite nations, circumscribed the

-narrow limits, yet a feeble minority, dif- ,_
traded with facion, was not a juncture for
forming schemes of doubtful success and re-
mote utility. The bigotry of Mary, and her
marriage with Philip, disposed her to pay a
iacred regard to that grant of the Holy See,
which vested in a husband, on whom she
doated, an exclusive right to every part of
the New World. Thus, through a singular
succession of various causes, fixty-one years
elapsed from the time that the English
discovered North America, during which
their monarchs gave little attention to that
country which was destined to be an-
nexed to their crown, and to be a chief
source of its opulence and power.

BUT though the public contributed little Expedi-

tion to

towards the progress of discovery, naval South
ikill, knowledge of commerce, and a spirit America,

under the
'f enterprize, began to spread among the command

of Sc-

Englilh. During the reign of Henry VIII. bafian

- countries with which England had formerly

no intercourse. Some merchants of Bristol
having fitted out two [hips for the southern
regions of America, committed the conduc
of them to Sebastian Cabot, who had quit-
*zS6. tcd the service of Spain. He visited the

coasts of Brasil, and touched at the islands
of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico; and though
this voyage seems not to have been bene-
ficial to the adventurers, it extended the
sphere of English navigation, and added to
the national stock of nautical science *.
Though disappointed in thcir expecations
of profit in this first essay, the merchants
were not dilcouraged. They sent, fuc.
ceffively, fevcral vefcels from different ports
towards the fame quarter, and fecm to
have carried on an interloping trade in the
Portuguese fettlemcnts with 'uccefs t. Nor
was it only towards the well, that the adi-

intercourse with several islands in the Ar-
chipelago, and with some of the towns on
the coast of Syria, they found a new mar-
ket for woollen cloths, (the only manu-
fature which the nation had begun to cul-
tivate,) and supplied their countrymen with
various productions of the east, formerly
unknown, or received from the Venetians
at an exorbitant price '.

of adventure. Cabot, whose opinion was BOO K
deservedly of high authority in whatever .
related to naval enterprise, warmly urged
the Englith to make another attempt to dif-
cover this passage. As it had been thrice
searched for in vain, by fleering towards the
north-west, he proposed that a trial should
now be made by the north-east; and sup-
ported this advice by such plausible reasons
and conjetures, as excited sanguine expect-
ations of success. Several noblemen and
persons of rank, together with some prin-
cipal merchants, having associated for this
purpose, were incorporated, by a charter
from the king, under the title of The
Company of Merchant Adventurers for the
Discovery of Regions, Dominions, Islands,
and Places unknown. Cabot, who was
appointed governor of this company, soon Issi;
fitted out two Ihips and a bark, furnished
with inftruaions in his own hand, which
discover the great extent both of his naval
ikill and mercantile sagacity.

c SIR

BOOK SIR Hugh Willoughby, who was en-

Ix. x-- trusted with the command, stood diretly
May 10. northwards along the coast of Norway,

and doubled the North Cape. But in that
tempestuous ocean, his small squadron was
separated in a violent storm. Willough-
by's ihip and the bark took refuge in an obh
fcure harbour in a desert part of Ruffian
Lapland, where he and all his companions

Wil- were frozen to death. Richard Chancelour,

hne of .fortunate; he entered the White Sea, and
his ships
winters at wintered in safety at Archangel. Though
.Arch-
n;lgl. no veflel of any foreign nation had ever

visited that quarter of the globe before, the
inhabitants received their new visitors with
an hospitality which would have done ho-
nour to a more polished people. The
English learned there, that this was a pro-
vince of a vast empire, subjed to the Great
Duke or Czar of Muscovy, who resided in
a great city twelve hundred miles from
Archangel. Chancelour, with a spirit be-

On his arrival in Moscow, he was ad-
mitted to audience, and delivered a letter
which the captain of each ship had received
from Edward VI. for the sovereign of
whatever country they should discover, to
John Vafilowitz, who at that time filled
the Ruffian throne. John, though he ruled
over his subje&s with the cruelty and ca-
price of a barbarous despot, was not de-
ftitute of political sagacity. He instantly
perceived the happy consequences that
might flow from opening an intercourse
between his dominions and the western
nations of Europe; and, delightedwith the
fortunate event to which he was indebted
for this unexpeted benefit, he treated
Chancelour with great refpea; and, by a Feb.
letter to the king of England, invited his '55+

of which was then hardly known in the

rection, at those regions which had been
so long the object of desire, excited a won-
derful ardour to prosecute the design with
greater vigour. Mary, implicitly guided
by her husband in every at of adminifira-
tion, was not unwilling to turn the com-
mercial activity of her fubjets towards a
quarter, where it could not excite the
jealousy of Spain, by encroaching on its

ports on both fides of the Line, and after
acquiring considerable knowledge of those
countries, returned with a cargo of gold.
dust, ivory, and other rich commodities,
little known at that time in England. This
commerce with Africa seems to have been
pursued with vigour, and was at that time
no less innocent than lucrative; for as the
English had then no demand for slaves, they
carried it on for many years, without vio-
lating the rights of humanity. Thus far

feeble as its steps at that time may appear
to us, we trace them with an interesting
curiosity, and look back with fatisfation to
the early essays of that spirit which we
now behold in the full maturity of its
strength. Even in those first efforts of the
English, an intelligent observer will discern
presages of their future improvement. As
soon as the activity of the nation was put in
motion, it took various directions, and ex-
erted itself in each with that feady, perse-
vering industry, which is the foul and
guide of commerce. Neither discouraged
by the hardships and dangers to which
they were exposed in those northern seas
which they first attempted to explore, nor
afraid of venturing into the sultry climates
of the torrid zone, the English, during the
reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., an4
Mary, opened some of the most confider-
able sources of their commercial opulence,
and gave a beginning to their trade with

so thoroughly, that the English enjoyed
that lucrative privilege during his long

feeble squadron, in which the largest vessel
did not exceed a hundred tons, and he ac-
compliflied it, with no less credit to him-
self, than honour to his country. Even in
this voyage, conduted with other views,
Drake seems not to have been inattentive to
the favourite obje& of his countrymen, the
discovery of a new route to India. Before
he quitted the Pacific Ocean, in order to

ranged along the coast of California, as high

acquired such a degree, either of wealth or _
of political influence, as were requisite to-
wards carrying a scheme of colonization
into execution. Persons of noble birth
were destitute of the ideas and Information
which might have disposed them to pa-
tronize such a design. The growing power
of Spain, however, and the ascendant over
the other nations of Europe to which it had
attained under Charles V. and his son, na-
turally turned the attention of mankind to-
wards the importance of those settlements in
the New World, to which they were so
much indebted for that pre-eminence. The
intercourse between Spain and England,
during the reign of Philip and Mary; the
resort of the Spanish nobility to the English
court, while Philip resided there; the ltudy
of the Spanish language, which became
fafhionablc; and the translation of several
histories of America into English, diffused
gradually through the nation a more dif-
tind knowledge of the policy of Spain in

hostilities commenced between Elizabeth
and Philip, the profped of annoying Spain
by sea opened a new career to the enter-

mofl every eminent leader of the age aimed
at diflinguifhing himself by naval explotis.
That service, and the ideas conneted with
it, the discovery of unknown countries, the
eftablifhmcnt of distant colonies, and the
enriching of commerce by new commodi-
ties, became familiar to persons of rank.

these plans were mostly persons of rank
and influence. Among them, Sir Hum-

dered himself conspicuous by his military i -x.
services both in France and Ireland; and
having afterwards turned his attention to
naval affairs, he published a discourse con-
cerning the probability of a north-west
passage, which discovered no inconsiderable
portion both of learning and ingenuity,
mingled with the enthusiasm, the credu-
lity, and sanguine expectations which in.
cite men to new and hazardous under-
takings *. With those talents, he was
deemed a proper person to be employed
in establishing a- new colony, and easily
obtained from the Queen letters patent, June I,
veiling in him sufficient powers for this 5
purpose.

His own character, and the zealous es-

and ungovernable spirit of some of his
crew; his total ignorance of the countries
which he purposed to occupy; his misfor-
tune in approaching the continent too far
towards the north, where the inhospitable
coast of Cape Breton did not invite them
to fettle; the Ihipwreck of his largest vef-
fel; and above all, the scanty provision
which the funds of a private man could
make of what was requisite for establishing
a new colony, were the true causes to
which the failure of the enterprise muff

vessels, under the command of Amadas

and to acquire some previous knowledge of

Dircovery In order to avoid Gilbert's error, in holding

fia.r' too far north, they took their course by the

Canaries and the Well India islands, and
approached the North American continent
by the Gulph of Florida. Unfortunately
their chief researches were made in that
part of the country now known by the
name of North Carolina, the province in
America most destitute of commodious har-
bours. They touched firfi at an island,

they had some intercourse with the na-

civilized life, bravery, aversion to labour,
hospitality, a propensity to admire, and a
willingness to exchange their rude pro-
ductions for English commodities, efpe-
cially for iron, or any of the useful metals
of which they were destitute. After spend-
ing a few weeks in this traffic, and in visit-
ing some parts of the adjacent continent,
Amadas and Barlow returned to England s:pt. iS.
with two of the natives, and gave such
splendid descriptions of the beauty of the
country, the fertility of the foil, and the
mildness of the climate, that Elizabeth, de-
lighted with the idea of occupying a terri-

they enquired after with unwearied eager-

too expensive for his narrow funds, had not
been able to fend them that recruit of stores
with which Greenville had promised to fur-

of the country in quest of food, when Sir Junc i.

turning from a successful expedition against
the Spaniards in the Weft Indies. A
scheme which he formed, of furnishing
Lane and his aflociates with such supplies
as might enable them to remain with com-

them a specimen of this new commodity
to England, and taught their countrymen

some young men of fashion, fondly adopted.
From imitation of them, from love of no.

its.falutary qualities entertained by several
physicians, the practice spread among the
English. The Spaniards and Portuguese
had, previous to this, introduced it in other
parts of Europe. This habit of taking to-

A FEW days after Drake departed from

Roanoke, a small bark, dispatched by Ra-
legh with a supply of stores for the co-

,_ .y) fitting out a powerful armament against

Spain, in order to eflablifh Don Antonio
on the throne of Portugal. He had begun
to form his favourite, but visionary plan,
of penetrating into the province of Guiana,
where he fondly dreamed of taking poflef-
lion of inexhaustible wealth, flowing from
the richest mines in the New World.
Amidst this multiplicity of projecs, of such
promising appearance, and recommended
by novelty, he naturally became cold to-
wards his ancient and hitherto unprofit-
able scheme of fettling a colony in Vir-

right of property in that country, which he
had never visited, together with all the
privileges contained in his patent, to Sir
March, Thomas Smith, and a company of mer-

with a paltry traffic carried on by a few

fettle did not, like those occupied by Spain,
invite them thither by any appearance of

of gain were distant; and they saw that
nothing could be earned but by persevering

vanity, he published, in the year one thou-

has been deemed the chief advantage result-

But in the infancy of colonization, and
without the guidance of observation or
experience, the ideas of men with refpea
to the mode of forming new settlements,
were not fully unfolded, or properly ar-
ranged. At a period when they could not
foresee the future grandeur and importance
of the communities which they were about
to call into existence, they were ill qualified
to concert the best plan for governing them.
Besides, the English of that age, accuf-
tomed to the high prerogative and arbi-
trary rule of their monarchs, were not ani-
mated with such liberal sentiments, either
concerning their own personal or political
rights, as have become familiar in the more
mature and improved state of their confti-

every mountain was supposed to contain a
treasure, and every rivulet was searched

their produc was carried to the common
store-houses, and distributed weekly to
every family, according to its number and
exigencies. A society, destitute of the first
advantage resulting from social union, was
not formed to prosper. Industry, when not
excited by the idea of property in what
was acquired by its own efforts, made no
vigorous exertion. The head had no in-
ducement to contrive, nor the hand to la-
bour. The idle and improvident trusted
entirely to what was issued from the com-
mon store; the assiduity even of the fober
and attentive relaxed, when they perceived
that others were to reap the fruit of their
toil; and it was computed, that the united
industry of the colony did not accomplish
as much work in a week as might have
been performed in a day, if each indivi-

formed as prepared the way for the in-

neglected. The land which ought to have
been reserved for raising provisions, and
even the streets of James-Town, were
planted with tobacco. Various regulations
were framed to restrain this ill-direaed ac-
tivity. But from eagerness for present
gain, the planters disregarded every ad-
monition. The means of subsistence be-
came so scanty as forced them to renew
their demands upon the Indians, who, fee-

pathy to the English name revived with
additional rancour, and they began to form

elevation to the fipreme command, a ge-

have been resolved upon; and during four
years, the means of perpetrating it with
the greatest facility and success were con-
certed with amazing secrecy. All the tribes
contiguous to the Engliih settlements were

Eastern shore, from whom, on account
of their peculiar attachment to their new
neighbours, every circumfRance that might
discover what they intended was carefully

off, almost without knowing by whose
hands they fell. The faughter would have
been universal, if compassion, or a sense of
duty, had not moved a converted Indian,

tended to accomplish their design. They
hunted the Indians like wild beafs, rather
than enemies; and as the pursuit of them
to their places of retreat in the woodsy
which covered their country, was both dif-
fficult and dangerous, they endeavoured to

the English were totally extirpated. This
atrocious deed, which the perpetrators la-

settlements began again to extend, and its

the will of the sovereign. Statutes were

authorize them by their fanidton. At the

of political rights, which they deemed

in his own hands. While the staple of the
colony in Virginia funk in value under
the oppreflion and restraints of a mono-
poly, property in land was rendered in-
secure by various grants of it, which Charles
inconfideratelybeftowed upon his favourites.
These were not only of such exorbitant
extent as to be unfavourable to the progrefi

that no commodities flould be imported
into any settlement in Asia, Africa, or
America, or exported from them, but in
vefiels of English or plantation built, where-
of the malter and three-fourths of the ma-
riners shall be English fubjeas, under pain

The productions fubje&ed to this reftric-

tions beyond seas are inhabited and peopled
by fubjeds of England, they may be kept
in a firmer dependance upon it, and ren-
dered yet more beneficial and advantage-
ous unto it, in the further employment and

as well as in the vent of Engliih woollen

BY these fucceflive regulations, the plan EffeAs of

of securing to England a monopoly of the
commerce with its colonies, and of shutting
up every other channel into which it might
be diverted, was perfected and reduced into
complete system. On one fide of the At.

as an extraordinary effort of political saga-
city, and have been confidered as the great
charter of national commerce, to which the
present state is indebted for all its opulence
and power. On the other, they have been
execrated as a code of oppreiflon, more
suited to the illiberality of mercantile ideas,

it was ncceffary to trace the progress of
those restraining laws with accuracy, as in
every fubfcquent tranfa&ion we may ob-
serve a perpetual exertion, on the part of
the mother-country, to enforce and extend
them; and on the part of the colonies,
endeavours no less unremitting, to elude or
to obftrud their operation.

Colonifis HARDLY was the aa of navigation
remon-
irate known in Virginia, and its effecs begun
again:t to be felt, when the colony remonstrated

against it as a grievance, and petitioned
earnestly for relief. But the commercial
ideas of Charles and his ministers coin-
cided so perfectly with those of parlia-
ment, that, instead of listening with a fa-
vourable ear to their applications, they la-
boured afliduouny to carry the aa into
firia execution. For this purpose, infiruc-

tions

tlons were issued to the governor, forts were B O O K
built on the banks of the principal rivers, ._b
and finall vessels appointed to cruize on the
coait. The Virginians, feeing no profped
of obtaining exemption from the a&, set
themselves to evade it, and found means,
notwithstanding the vigilance with which
they were watched, of carrying on a con-
fiderable clandefline trade with foreigners,
particularly with the Dutch fettled on
Hudson's River. Emboldened by observing
difaffeation spread through the colony, some
veteran soldiers who had served under
Cromwell, and had been banished to Vir-
ginia, formed a design of rendering them- 1663.
selves masters of the country, and of assert-
ing its independence on England. This
ralh project was discovered by one of their
associates, and disconcerted by the vigorous
exertions of Sir William Berkeley. But
the spirit of discontent, though repressed,
was not extinguished. Every day some-
thing occurred to revive and to nourish it.

in a greater or lesser degree affeced every
individual in the colony, the indignation of
the people became general, and was worked
up to such a pitch, that nothing was want-
ing to precipitate them into the most de-
fperate ads, but some leader, qualified to
unite and to diret their operations .

B o o K mitted into the council, and was regarded
.Â· .-. as one of the most refpe&able persons in

the colony. Bacon was ambitious, eloquent,
daring, and prompted either by honest
zeal to redress the public wrongs, or allured
by hopes of raising himself to diftinaion
and power, he mingled with the malcon-
tents, and by his bold harangues and con-
sident promises of removing all their griev-
ances, he inflamed them almost to madness.
As the devastations committed by the In-
dians was the calamity most sensibly felt by
the people, he accused the governor of hav-
ing negleted the proper measures for re-
pelling the invasions of the savages, and
exhorted them to take arms in their own
defence, and to exterminate that odious
race. Great numbers assembled, and chose
Bacon to be their general. He applied to
the governor for a commission, confirming
this election of the people, and offered to
march instantly against the common enemy.
Berkeley, accustomed by long poffeflion of
fuprcme command to high ideas of the

refpca

refpcct due to his station, confidered this B 0 0 K
tumultuary armament as an open insult to
his authority, and fufpeaed that, under
icpcious appearances, Bacon concealed most
dangerous designs. Unwilling, however, to
give farther provocation to an incensed mul-
titude, by a direct refusal of what they
demanded, he thought it prudent to nego-
ciate, in order to gain time; and it was not
until he found all endeavours to sooth them
ineffecdual, that he issued a proclamation,
requiring them, in the king's name, under
the pain of being denounced rebels, to
disperse.

BUT Bacon, sensible that he had now

advanced so far as rendered it impoflible to
recede with honour or safety, instantly took
the only resolution that remained in his
situation. At the head of a chofcn body
of his followers he marched rapidly to
James-Town, and surrounding the house
where the governor and council were as-
fcmbled, demanded the commiflion foi

peremptorily refused to comply, and calmly
presented his naked breast to the weapons
which were pointed against it. The coun-
cil, however, foreseeing the fatal confe-
quences of driving an enraged multitude,
in whose power they were, to the last
extremities of violence, prepared a com-
mission, constituting Bacon general of all
the forces in Virginia, and by their entrea-
ties prevailed on the governor to sign it.
Bacon with his troops retired in triumph.
Hardly was the council delivered by his
departure from the dread of present danger,
when, by a transition not unusual in feeble
minds, prcfumptuous boldness succeeded to
excessive fear. The commission granted to
Bacon was declared to be null, having been
extorted by force; he was proclaimed a
rebel, his followers were required to
abandon his standard, and the militia or-
dered to arm, and to join the governor.

resist such a numerous body, made hisefcape,
and fled across the bay to Acomack on the
Eastern shore. Some of the counsellors
accompanied him thither, others retired to
their own plantations. Upon the flight of
Sir William Berkeley, and dispersion of the
council, the frame of civil government in
the colony seemed to be dissolved, and Ba-
con became possessed of supreme and un-
controlled power. But as he was sensible
that his countrymen would not long sub-
mit with patience to authority acquired and
held merely by force of arms, he endea-
voured to found it on a more constitutional
basis, by obtaining the fanaion of the
people's approbation. With this view he
called together the most considerable gen.-
tlemen in the colony, and having pre-

vailed

every enemy that should oppose it, he
from that time confidered his jurifdidion as

Sir W. BERKELEY, meanwhile, having collcted

fiOr uO parts of the colony, where Bacon's au-
England. thority was recognized. Several sharp con-

flics happened with various success. James-
Town was reduced to ashes, and the belt
cultivated difirids in the province were laid
waftc, sometimes by one party, and some-
times by the other. But it was not by his
own exertions that the governor hoped to
terminate the contest. He had early tranf-
mittcd an account of the tranfations in
Virginia to the king, and demanded fucih a
body of soldiers as would enable him to
quell the insurgents, whom he representcd
as so exafpcrated by the reflraints im.
posed on their trade, that they were in-
patient to shake off all dependance on the

tion no less dangerous than unexpected, i_'
and solicitous to maintain his authority
over a colony, the value of which was daily
increasing, and more fully understood,
speedily dispatched a finall squadron, with
such a number of regular troops as Berke-
ley had required. Bacon and his followers
received information of this armament, but
were not intimidated at its approach. They
boldly determined to oppose it with open
force, and declared it to be confifent with
their duty and allegiance, tp treat all who
should aid SirWilliam Berkeley as enemies,
until they should have an opportunity of
laying their grievances before their fove-
reign *.

sessed such talents, or were so much ob-

them to aspire to the supreme command.
Destitute of a leader to conduct and ani-
mate them, their sanguine hopes of success
subsided; mutual distrust accompanied this
universal despondency: all began to wish
for an accommodation; and after a short
negociation with SirWilliam Berkeley, they
laid down their arms, and submitted to his
government, on obtaining a promise of ge-
neral pardon.

THUS terminated an infurre&ion, which,

in the annals of Virginia, is distinguished
by the name of Bacon's rebellion. During
seven months this daring leader was master
of the colony, while the royal governor was

of it. What were the real motives that

that of other adventurers in fation, would
have been regulatedchiefly by events; and

State of FROM that period to the Revolution in

Relu,, currence in the history of Virginia. A

Under several successive governors, admi-
uiftration was carried on in the colony
with the fame arbitrary spirit that dif-
tinguiihed the latter years of Charles II.
and the precipitate counsels of James II.
The Virginians, with a constitution which,
in form, rcfcmbled that of England, enjoy-
ed hardly any portion of the liberty which
that admirable system of policy is framed
to Iccure. They were deprived even of the

of complaining, by a law which, under _-

however, the laws restraining their com-
merce were felt as an intolerable grievance,
and nourished in secret a spirit of difcon-
tent, which, from the necessity of con-
cealing it, acquired a greater degree of
acrimony. But notwithstanding those un-
favourable circumstances, the colony con-
tinued to increase. The use of tobacco was
now become general in Europe; and

the spirit of industry, by fixing the feat of
one branch of the trade that was now to be

fesses such advantages of situation, that the

have always centered in the capital. At the

and privileges conferred by the king on the

fell far short of those in London, in the

whose name has been so often mentioned it New
with diftintion in the History of Virginia England.
The adventure was prosperous and lucra-
tive. But his ardent enterprising mind
could not confine its attention to objects so
unequal to it as the petty details of a trad-
ing voyage. He employed a part of his
time in exploring the coast, and in deli-
neating its bays and harbours. On his

to make any new attempt towards efta-

Different WHEN the superstitions and corruptions

fpheaing nations of Europe to throw off its yoke,
church
govern- and to withdraw from its communion, the
wnent that
prevailed mode as well as degree of their reparation
ft'aRn- was various. Wherever reformation was
tion. sudden, and carried on by the people with-

out authority from their rulers, or in op-
position to it, the rupture was violent and
total. Every part of the ancient fabric was
overturned, and a different system, not only
with refpea to dotrine, but to church go-
vernment, and the external rites of wor-
ihip, was established. Calvin, who, by his
abilities, learning, and austerity of man-
ners, had acquired high reputation and au-
thority in the ProteRant churches, was a
zealous advocate for this plan of thorough
reformation. He exhibited a model of that
pure form of ecclesiastical policy, which he
approved in the conftittti9o of the church

of

of Geneva. The simplicity of its irititu- B OO K
tions, and still more their repugnancy to s
those of the Popiih church, were so much
admired by all the firicer reformers, that
it was copied, with some small variations,
in Scotland, in the Republic of the United
Provinces, in the dominions of the House
of Brandenburgh, in those of the Eletor
Palatine, and in the churches of the Hugo-
nots in France.

BUT in those countries where the steps

of departure from the church of Rome
were taken with greater deliberation, and
regulated by the wisdom or policy of the
supreme magifirate, the separation was not
so wide. Of all the reformed churches,
that of England has deviated least from the
ancient institutions. The violent but ca-
pricious spirit of Henry VIII. who, though
he disclaimed the supremacy, revered the
tenets of the Papal fee, checked innovations
in doctrine or worship during his reign.
When his son ascended the throne, and the

M 4 Protestant

BO0 0 K Protestant religion was eftablilhed by law,

x. _-q.. the cautious prudence of Archbishop Cran-

mner moderated the zeal of those who had
espoused the new opinions. Though the
articles to be recognized as the system of
national faith were framed conformably to
the doctrines of Calvin, his notions with
refpea to church government and the
mode of worship were not adopted. As
the hierarchy in England was incorporated
with the civil policy of the kingdom, and
constituted a member of the legislature,
archbishops and bishops, with all the sub-
ordinate ranks of ecclefiaitics subjet to
them, were continued according to ancient
form, and with the fame dignity and jurif-
diaion. The peculiar vetments in which
the clergy performed their sacred funtions,
bowing at the name of Jesus, kneeling at
receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup.
per, the sign of the Cross in baptism, the
use of the Ring in marriage, with several
other rites to which long usage had accuf-
tomed the people, and which time had ren-

dered

dered venerable, were fRill retained. But B 00
though Parliament enjoined the observance -
of these ceremonies under very severe pe-
nalties *, several of the more zealous clergy
entertained scruples with refpe& to the law-
fulness of complying with this injunction;
and the-vigilance and'authority of Cranmer
and Ridley with difficulty saved their in-
sant church from the disgrace of a schism
on this account.

their own church. They returned to Eng-
land as soon as Elizabeth te-eftablifhed the
Protestant religion, not only with more
violent antipathy to the opinions and prac-
tices of that church by which they had
been oppressed, but with a strong attach-
ment to that mode of worihip to which
they had been for some years accustomed.
As they were received by their country-
men with the veneration due to confessors,
they exerted all the influence derived from
that opinion, in order to obtain such a re-
formation in the English ritual as might
bring it nearer to the standard of purity
in foreign churches. Some of the queen's
most confidential miaifters were warmly
disposed to co-operate with them in this

notwithfianding this cruel disappointment
of the sanguine hopes with which they re-
turned to their native country, did not re-
linquifh their design. They disseminated
their opinions with great industry among
the people. They extolled the purity of
foreign churches, and inveighed against the
superstitious practices with which religion
was defiled in their own church. In vain
did the defenders of the established system
represent that these forms and ceremonies
were, in themselves, things perfectly indif-
ferent, which, from long usage, were view-
ed with reverence; and, by their impreflion
upon the senses and imagination, tended
not only to fix the attention, but to asset
the heart, and to warm it with devout and
worthy sentiments. The Puritans (for by

the rites in question were inventions of
men, superadded to the simple and reason-
able service required in the word of God;
that from the excessive solicitude with which
conformity to them was exa&ed, the mul-
titude must conceive such an high opinion
of their value and importance, as might
induce them to reft satisfied with the mere
form and Ihadow of religion, and to ima-
gine that external observances may com-
penfate for the want of inward san&ity;
that ceremonies which had been long em-
ployed by a society manifestly corrupt, to
veil its own defeas, and to seduce and
fascinate mankind, ought now to be rejet-
ed as relics of fuperRition unworthy of a
place in a church which gloried in the
name of Reformcd.

The desire of a farther separation from the
church of Rome spread wide through, the
nation. The preachers who contended for.
this, and whp refused to, wear the fur-
plice, and other vestments peculiar to their
order, or to observe the ceremonies en-
joined by law, were followed and admired,.
while the ministry of the zealous advocates
for conformity was deserted, and:their per-
sons often exposed to insult. For some
time the non-conformits were connived
at; but as their number and boldness in-
created, the interposition both of spiritual:
and civil authority was deemed neceflary in.
order to check their progress. To the dif-
grace of Christians, the sacred rights of
conscience and private judgment, as well as
the charity and mutual forbearance suit-

which they professed, were in that age litte,

BOOK understood. Not only the idea of tole-

'_, ration, but even the word itself in the

sense now affixed to it, was then un-
known. Every church claimed a right to
employ the hand of power for the protec-
tion of truth and the extirpation of error.
The laws of her kingdom armed Elizabeth
with ample authority for this purpose, and
she was abundantly disposed to exercise it
with full vigour. Many of the most emi-
ment among the Puritan clergy were de-
prived of their benefices, others were im-
prisoned, several were fined, and some put
to death. But persecution, as usually hap-
pens, instead of extinguishing, inflamed
their zeal to such a height, that the jurif-
didion of the ordinary courts of law was
deemed insufficient to suppress it, and a
new tribunal was established under the title
of the high commffion for ecclefiaticalaffairs,
whose powers and mode of procedure were
hardly less odious or less hostile to the
principles of justice than those of the Spa-
n!h inquisition. Several attempts were

made

made in the House of Commons to check B Qo'
these arbitrary proceedings, and to mode- X
rate the rage of persecution; but the Queen
always imposed silence upon those who
presumed to deliver any opinion with re-
Ipc to a matter appertaining solely to her
prerogative, in a tone as imperious and
arrogant as was ever used by Henry VIII.
in addressing his Parliaments; and so tame-
ly obsequious were the guardians of the
people's rights, that they not only obeyed
those unconstitutional commands, but con-
sented to an a&, by which every person
who should absent himself from church
during a month was fubjeted to punilh-
ment by fine and imprisonment; and if
after conviAion he did not, within three
months, renounce his erroneous opinions
and conform to the laws, he was then
obliged to abjure the realm; but if he
either refused to comply with this condi-
tion, or returned from banilhment, he
should be put to death as a felon without
benefit of clergy *.

afperated by this rigorous treatment, their
antipathy to the established religion in-
creased, and, with the progress natural to
violent paflions, carried them far beyond
what was their original aim. The first
Puritans did not entertain any scruples with
refpe& to the lawfulness of Episcopal go-
vernment, and seem to have been very un-
villing to withdraw from communion with
the church of which they were members.
But when they were thrown out of her
bosom, and conitrained to hold separate as-
femblies for the worship of God, their fol-
lowers no longer viewed a society by wlIicl
they were oppressed with reverence or as-
feCion. Her government, her discipline,
her ritual, were examined with minute at-
tention. Every error was pointed out, and
every defect magnified. The more boldly

greater approbation; and the farther he h -__.
urged his disciples to depart from such an
impure community, the more eagerly did
they follow him. By degrees, ideas of eccle-
fiaftical policy, altogether repugnant to those
of the established church, gained footing in
the nation. The more fober and learned
Puritans inclined to that form which is
known by the name of Preibyterian. Such
as were more thoroughly possessed with the
spirit of innovation, however much they
might approve the equality of pastors which
that system establishes, reprobated the au-
thority which it vests in various judicato-
ries, descending from one to another in re-
gular Subordination, as inconsistent with
Christian liberty.

THESE wild notions floated for some

time in the minds of the people, and amused
them with many ideal schemes of eccle-
fiaftical policy. At length Robert Brown, Brownis,.

that the church of England was corrupt,
and antichriftians, its ministers not lawfully

valid; and therefore he prohibited his people
to hold communion with it in any religious
funacion. He maintained, that a society of
Christians, uniting together to worlhip God,
constituted a church, possessed of complete
jurifdiaion in the conduct of its own as-
fairs, independent of any other society, and
unaccountable to any superior; that the
priesthood was neither a diftind order in
the church, nor conferred an indelible cha-
racter; but that every man qualified to
teach might be set apart for that office by
the election of the brethren, and by im-
position of their hands; in like manner,
by their authority, he might be discharged
from that function, and reduced to the
rank of a private Christian; that every
person when admitted a member of a

of power on every individual, accorded so
perfectly with the levelling genius of fana-

as a complete model of Christian policy.
From their founder, they were denomi-
nated Brownifts; and as their tenets were
more hostile to the established religion than
those of other separatists, the fiercest storm
of persecution fell upon their heads. Many
of them were fined or imprisoned, and
some put to death; and though Brown,

spread, especially among persons in the

all their motions were carefully watched,
both by the ecclesiastical and civil courts,
which, as often as they were deteced,
puniihed them with the utmost rigour, a
body of them, weary of living in a ifate of
continual danger and alarm, fled to Hol-
land, and fettled in Leyden, under the
care of Mr. John Robinson, their pastor.
There they resided for several years un-
molested and obscure. But many of their
aged members dying, and rome of the
younger marrying into Dutch families,
while their church received no increase,
either 'by recruits from England, or by
proselytes gained in the country, they be-
gan to be afraid, that all their high at-
tainments in spiritual knowledge would be
loft, and that perfect fabric of policy,
which they had ereded, would be dissolved

themselves called, in order to prevent it,
to remove to some other place, where they
might profess and propagate their opinions
with greater success. America, in which
their countrymen were at that time in-
tent on planting colonies, prelented itself
to their thoughts. They flattered them-
selves with hopes of being permitted, in
that remote region, to follow their own
ideas in religion without disturbance. The
dangers and hardships to which all former
emigrants to America had been exposed, did
not deter them. "They were well weaned,
(according to their own description) from
the delicate milk of their mother country,
and enured to the difficulties of a strange
land. They were knit together in a itria
and sacred band, by virtue of which they

was not with them, as with other men,
whom small things could discourage, or
small discontents cause to wish themselves

(olicitude was to secure the free exercise of
their religion. For this purpose they ap-
plied to the king; and though James re-
fused to give them any explicit assurance of
toleration, they seem to have obtained from
him some promise of his connivance, as
long as they continued to demean them-
selves quietly. So eager were they to ac-
complifh their favourite scheme, that, rely-
ing on this precarious security, they begain
to negociate with the Virginian company
for a tract of land within the limits of
their patent. This they easily procured
from a focicty desirous of encouraging mi-
gration to a vast country, of which they
had hitherto occupied only a few spots.

A hundred and twenty persons failed from Firaat-
England in a single ihip on this arduous fettlpti
undertaking. The place of their deftina- Muafea
tion was Hudson's River, where they in- Bay.
tended to fettle; but their captain having
been bribed, as is said, by the Dutch, who
had then formed a scheme which they as-
terwards accomplished of planting a colony
there, carried them so far towards the
north, that the first land in America which
they made was Cape-Cod. They were Nov. ,.
now, not only beyond the precin/ts of the
territory which had been granted to them,
but beyond those of the company from
which they derived their right. The sea.
son, however, was so far advanced, and
ticknefs raged so violently among men un-
accultomed to the hardships of a long
voyage, that it became necessary to take
up their abode there. After exploring the
coast, they chose for their station, a place

No season could be more unfavourable

to settlement than that in which the colony
landed. The winter, which, from the pre-
dominance of cold in America, is rigorous
to a degree unknown in parallel latitudes
of our hemisphere, was already set in; and
they were slenderly provided with what
was requisite for comfortable fubfiftance,
under a climate considerably more fevcre
than that for which they had made prepa-
ration. Above one half of them was cut
off before the return of spring, by diseases,
or by famine: the survivors, inflead of hav-
ing Icifure to attend to the supply of their
own wants, were compelled to take arms

that which they had established in Hol-
land. Their system of civil government
was founded on those ideas of the natural

free man, who was a member of the
church, was admitted into the supreme
legislative body. The laws of England
were adopted as the basis of their jurif.

the violent persecution to which Puritans.

they now despaired of obtaining in theit

statutes enacted against their fe&, many
began to turn their eyes towards some
other place of retreat, where they might
profess their own opinions with impunity.
From the tranquillity which their brethren
had hitherto enjoyed in New Plymouth,
they hoped to find this desired asylum in

White, a non-conformist minilter at Dora

taught the English the impropriety of com-
mitting the government of settlements in
America, to exclusive corporations resident
in Europe, neither the king nor his sub-
jets had profited so much by what passcd
before their eyes, as to have extended their
ideas beyond those adopted by James, in
his first attempts towards colonization.
The charteirof Charles I. to the adven-
turers associated for planting the province

of

of Massachusets Bay, was perfetly similar B X00 K

x.

to those granted by his father to the two * i
Virginian companies and to the council of
Plymouth. The new adventurers were in-
corporated as a body politic, and their right
to the territory, which they had purchased
from the council of Plymouth, being con-
firmed by the king, they were empowered
to dispose bs the lands, and to govern the
people who should fettle upon them. The
first governor of the company, and his
assistants, were named by the crown: the
right of electing their successors was vested
in the members of the corporation. The
executive power was committed to the go-
vernor and assistants; that of legislation to
the body of proprietors, who might make
statutes and orders for the good of the com-
munity, not inconsistent with the laws of
England, and inforce the observance of
them, according to the course of other cor-
porations within the realm. Their lands
were to be held by the fame liberal tenure
with thofc granted to the Virginian com-

B3 0 K pany. They obtained the fame temporary

duties on goods exported or imported; and
notwithstanding their migration to Ame-
rica, they and their defccndants were de-
clared to be entitled to all the rights of na-
tural-born fubjeds *.

TIIE manifelt objea of this charter was

to confer on the adventurers who under-
took to people the territory on Malfachu-
sets Bay, all the corporate rights possessed
by the council of Plymouth, from which
they had purchased it, and to form them
into a public body, .resembling other great
trading companies, which the spirit of mo-
narchy had at that time multiplied in the
kingdom. The king seems not to have fore-
fcen, or to have fufpeded, the secret in-

These were mostly zealous Puritans, whose
chief inducement to relinquish their native
land was the hope of enjoying religious li-
berty, in a country far removed from the
c~at of government and the opprcffion of
ecclesiastical courts. Some eminent non-
conformist ministers accompanied them as
their spiritual inftrutors. On their arri-
val in New England, they found the
wretched remainder of a small body of
June 29.' emigrants, who had left England the pre-

ceding year, under the conduct of Endi-
cott, a deep enthusiast, whom, prior to their
incorporation by the royal charter, the as-
fociates had appointed deputy governor.
They were fettled at a place called by the
Indians Naunekeag, and to which Endicott,

aimed. Without regard to the sentiments
of that monarch under the fandion of whose
authority they fettled in America, and from
whom they derived right to aa as a body

England, with which the charter required
that none of their ads or ordinances should

in frarming this model of a pure church.
But, in the first moment that they began to
taste of Christian liberty themselves, they
forgot that other men had an equal title to
enjoy it. Some of their number, retaining
an high veneration for the ritual of the
Englilh church, were so much offended at
the total abolition of it, that they with-
drew from communion with the newly-
inRfituted church, and assembled separately
for the worship of God. With an incon-
fiftency, of which there are such flagrant
inflances among Christians of every deno-
mination that it cannot be imputed as a
reproach peculiar to any fedt, the very men
who had themselves fled from persecution
became persecutors; and had recourse, in
order to enforce their own opinions, to the
fame unhallowed weapons, against the em-
ployment of which they had lately remon-
firated with so much violence. Endicott

on the approach of winter, they suffered so
much from diseases, which carried off al-

porate powers of the company ihould be

IN this singular tranfadion, to which

of the company to make this transference;
the other is the silent acquiescence with
which the king permitted it to take place.

neither exercise thofc powers in any mode
different from what the charter prescribed,
nor alienate them in such a manner as to
convert the jurifdidion of a trading cor-

institution of the company of Maffachu-
sets Bay, its members seem to have been
animated with a spirit of innovation in
civil policy, as well as in religion; and by
the habit of xejeting eftblithed usages in
the one, they were prepared for deviating
from them in the other. They had applied
for a royal charter, in order to give legal
effea to their operations in England, as
ads of a body politic; but the persons
whom they font out to Americ', as foor
as they landed there, confidered thetfelves
as individuals, united together by voluntary

lem, without regard to the institutions of
the church of England, of which the char-
ter supposed them to be members, and
bound of consequence to conformity with
its ritual. Suitably to the fame ideas, we
ihall observe them framing all their future
plans of civil and ecclesiastical policy. The
king, though abundantly vigilant in ob-
serving and checking flighter encroach-
ments on his prerogative, was either so
much occupied at that time with other cares
occasioned by his fatal breach with his par-
liament, that he could not attend to the pro-
ceedings of the company; or he was so
much pleased with the profped of remov-

the care of making provision for their sub-
filtcnce during winter, occupied them en-
tirely during some months. But in the
ot. 19. first general court, their disposition to con-

fider themselves as members of an inde-

tions in their charter, began to appear.
The clcCtion of the governor and deputy
governor, the appointment of all other of-
licers, and even the power of making laws,
all which were granted by the charter to
the freemen, were taken from them, and
vested in the council of afliftants. But the
ariflocratical spirit of this resolution did not
accord with the ideas of equality prevalent
among the people, who had been surprised
1631. into an approbation of it. Next year the

into the church as members *. By this re-
solution, every person who did not hold

preme courts were held; personal attend-
ance became inconvenient; the form of go-

familiar the idea of delegating their rights,
and committing the guardianship of their
liberties, to representatives of their own
choice, and the experience of ages had
taught them that this important truR might
with safety be lodged in their hands. Thus
did the company of Mafiachufets Bay, in
less than fix years from .its incorporation
by the king, mature and perfec a scheme

its more artful and aspiring leaders seem to

wilder and more extravagant. Williams,
a minister of Salem, in high estimation,
having conceived an antipathy to the cross
of St. George in the standard of England,
declaimed against it with so much vehe-
mence as a relic of superstition and idol-
atry which ought not to be retained among
a people so pure and fandiified, that Endi-
cot, one of the members of the court of
affiflants, in a tranlport of zeal, publicly
cut out the cross from the cnfign displaycd
before the governor's gate. T'his frivolous

matter interested and divided the colo- BOOK
uy. Some of the militia scrupled to _.,
follow colours in which there was a cross,
left they should do honour to an idol:
others refused to serve under a mutilated
banner, left they should be fulpeaed of
having renounced their allegiance to the
crown of England. After a long contro-
verfy, carried on by both parties with that
heat and zeal which in trivial disputes sup-
ply the want of argument, the contest was
terminated by a compromise. The cross
was retained in the ensigns of forts and
ihips, but erased from the colours of the
militia. Williams, on account of this, as
well as of some other docrines deemed
unsound, was banished out of the colony *.

Mr. Henry Vane, son of Sir Henry Vane,
a privy counsellor, high in office, and of
great credit with the king; a young man of
a noble family, animated with such zeal
for pure religion and such love of liberty
as induced him to relinquish all his hopes
in England, and to fettle in a colony hi-
therto no farther advanced in improvement
than barely to afford fubfitence to its
members, was received with the fondest
admiration. His mortified appearance, his
demure look, and rigid manners, carried
even beyond the standard of preciseness in
that focicty which he joined, seemed to in-
dicate a man of high spiritual attainments,
while his abilities and address in business

station in the community. With universal
consent, and high expetations of advan- 1636.
tage from his adminifiration, he was eleaed
governor in the year subsequent to his ar-
rival. But as the affairs of an infant colony
afforded not objeds adequate to the talents
of Vane, his busy pragmatical spirit occu-
pied itself with theological fubtilties and
speculations unworthy of his attention.
These were excited by a woman, whose
reveries produced such effe&s both within
the colony and beyond its precints, that,
frivolous as they may now appear, they
must be mentioned as an occurrence of
importance in its history.

IT was the custom at that time in New Annt;-

England, among the chief men in every E
congregation, to meet once a week, in
order to repeat the sermons which they
had heard, and to hold religious confer-
ence with refped to the dotrine contained
in them. Mrs. Hutchinson, whose husband

of the men. At first Ihe satisfied hcrfelf
with repeating what ihe could rccollet of
the discourses delivered by their teachers.
She began afterwards to add illustrations,
and at length proceeded to censure some
of the clergy as unlound, and to vent opi-
nions and fancies of her own. Theie were
all founded on the system which is deno-
minated Antinomian by divines, and tinged
with the deepest enthufiafi. She taught,
that fandity of life is no evidence of julli-
fication, or of a state of favour witl God;
and that such as inculcated the neceflity of
manifesting the reality of our faith by obe-
dience, preached only a covenant of works:
.fhc contended that the fj)irit of God dwelt
personally in good men, and by inward
revelations and imprciions they received

the fullest dicfoveries of the divine will. Bo oK

The fluency and confidence with which she _
delivered there notions gained her many
admirers and proselytes, not only among
the vulgar, but among the principal inha-

ny, Mrs. Hutchinson's opinions were con-
demned as erroneous, and the herself ba-

him; some of whom now regarded him as
a mere visionary, and others as one of

to a pastor whole piety they revered, that a
good number of them voluntarily accom-
panied him in his exile. They directed
their march towards the south; and having
purchased from the natives a considerable
traat of land, to which Williams gave the
name of Providence, they fettled there.

liberties Which they deemed essential to the
well-being of society. They, too, fixed on
the banks of.the Connecticut as their place

building a fort at the mouth of the river,

.-,- only Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain

Mason seem to have had any serious inten.
tion to occupy the lands allotted to them.
Their efforts to accomplish this were meri-
torious and persevering, but unsuccessful.
The expence of fettling colonies in an un-
cultivated country must necessarily be great
and immediate; the profpe& of a return is
often uncertain and always remote. The
funds of two private adventurers were not
adequate to such an undertaking. Nor did
the planters whom they sent out pofTefs that
principle of enthusiasm, which animated
their neighbours of Massachusets with vi-
gour,. to struggle through all the hardships
and dangers to which society, in its in-
fancy, is exposed in a savage land. Gorges
and Mason, it is probable, must have aban-
doned their design, if, from the fame mo-
tives that settlements had been made in
Rhode Island and Connefticut, colonifls
had not uncxpectedly migrated into New
Hamplhire and Main. Mr. Wheelwri.ht,

a miniftcr

a minister of Come note, nearly related to o OK
Mrs. Hutchinson, and one of her noft ser- .
vent admirers and partisans, had, on this
account, been banished from the province of
Massachusets Bay *. In quest of a new fta-
tion, he took a course opposite to the other
exiles; and advancing towards the north,-
founded the town of Exeter, on a small'
river flowing into Pifkataqua Bay. His
followers, few in number, but firmly united,
were of such rigid principles, that even the
churches of Massachusets did not appear to
them sufficiently pure. From time to time
they received some recruits, whom love of
novelty, or diffatisfadion with the eccle-
fiaflical institutions of the other colonies,
prompted to join them. Their plantations
were widely dispersed, but the country was
thinly peopled, and its political state ex-
tremely unsettled. The colony of Mafla.
chufets Bay claimedjurifdi6ttion over them,
as occupying lands situated within the li-
mits of their grant. Gorges and Mason

soon found that they were furrourdcd e bYr the

Among there the most considerable were
the Naraganfets and Pequods; the former
feated on the Bay which bears their name,
and the latter occutpying the territory which
fretches from the rivet Pequod along' tlhe
banks of the Connecticut. The Peqqods
wvere a formidable people, who could bring
into the field a tho'usand warriors, rlot ii-
ferior in courage to' any id the sew World.
They foresaw, n6ot only that the extermi-
nation of tle Indian race must be the con-
sequence of permitting the English tO spread
6ver the continent of America, but that if
measures were not speedily concerted to
prevent it, the calamity would be unavoid-
able. With'this view they applied to the

Qc . Nara-

B OO K Naraganfets, requesting them to forget an-

X.

cient animofities for a moment, and to co-
operate with them in expelling a common
enemy who threatened both with defRruc-
tion. They represented that, when those
strangers first landed, the objet of their
visit was not fufpedted, and no proper pre-
cautions were taken to check their progress;
that now, by fending out colonies in one
year towards three different quarters, their
intentions were manifest, and the people of
America must abandon their native feats to
make way for unjust intruders.

BUT the Naraganfets and Pequods, like

most of the contiguous tribes in America,
were rivals, and there subsisted between
them an hereditary and implacable enmity.
Revenge is the darling palion of savages;

there is no present advantage that they will

of wreaking their vengeance on their an-

more exasperated than discouraged. by the
imprudence and treachery of their country-
men, took the field, and carried on the war
in the usual mode of Americans. They
surprised stragglers, and scalped them; they
plundered and burnt remote settlements;
they attacked Fort Say Brook without fuc-
cess, though garrisoned only by twenty
men; and when the English began to a&
offensively, they retired to fastnesses which
they deemed inaccessible. The different co-
lonies had agreed to unite against the com-
mon enemy, each furnishing a quota of
men in proportion to its numbers. The
troops of Connecticut which lay most ex-
posed to danger were soon assembled. The
march of those from Massachusets, which
formed the most considerable body, was re-
tarded by the most singular cause that ever

army. officers, as well as of the private soldiers,

were till under a covenant of works; and
that the blefling of God could not be im-
plored or expeted to crown the arms of
such unhallowed men with success. The
alarm was general, and many arrangements
necessary in order to cast out the unclean,
and to render this little band sufficiently
pure to fight the battles of a people who
entertained high ideas of their own fanc-

which they had surrounded with palifa-
does, the best defence that their slender

skill in the art of fortification had discover- B o o K
ed. Though they knew that the English .-X
were in motion, yet, with the uiual impro-
vidence and security of savages, they took
no measures either to observe their r.o-
grefs, or to guard against being surprised
themselves. The enemy, unperceived, May o;
reached the palifadoes, and if a dog had
not given the alarm by barking, the In-
dians must have been massacred without
resistance. In a moment, however, they
started to arms, and raising the war-cry,
prepared to repel the assailants. But at
that early period of their intercourse with
the Europeans, the Americans were little
acquainted with the use of gunpowder, and
dreaded its effeas extremely. While rome
of the Englilh galled them with an in-
ceffant fire through the intervals between
the palifadoes, others forced their way by
the entries into the fort, filled only with
branches of trees; and setting fire to the
huts which were covered with reeds, the
confulion and terror quickly became gene-
ral. Many of the women and children

B O0 K perished in the flames; and the warriors,

-x_ in endeavouring to escape, were either lain

by the English, or falling into the hands of
their Indian allies, who surrounded the fort
at a distance, were reserved for a more cruel
hite. After the juntion of the troops from
Massachusets, the English resolved to pursue
their vitory; and hunting the Indians from
bie place of retreat to another, some sub-
sequent encounters were hardly less fatal
to them than the action on the Miftick.
In less than three months the tribe of
Pequods was extirpated: a few miserable
fugitives who took refuge among the neigh-
bouring Indians, being incorporated by
them, loft their name as a diftine people.

Cruelties In this firit efray of their arms, the colo-
exercised egainllthe nifts of New England seem to have been

conduted by skilful and enterprising of-
ficers, and displayed both courage and per-
severance as soldiers. But they stained their
laurels by the ufc which they made of vic-
tory. Instead of treating the Pequods as
an independent people, who made a gallant
effort to defend the property, the rights,

and

and the freedom of their nation, they re- B O o ,.
taliated upon them all the barbarities of. x'-.
American war. Some they massacred in
cold blood, others they gave up to be tor-
tured by their Indian allies, a considerable
number they fold as slaves in Bermudas,
the reft were reduced to servitude among
themselves *.

BUT reprehensible as this condut of the Emigr-

English must be deemed, their vigorous rions from
efforts in this decisive campaign filled all England
the surrounding tribes of Indians with such
an high opinion of their valour as fe-
cured a long tranquillity to all their fettle-
ments. At the fame time the violence of
administration in England continued to in-
crease their population and strength, by
forcing many refpedable fubjets to tear
themselves from all the tender connetions
that bind men to their native country, and

nothing that could allure them thither but

that a proclamation was issued, prohibiting
masters of ships from carrying passengers
to NewEngland without special permiflion.
On many occasions this injunction was
eluded or disregarded. Fatally for the king,
it operated with full effect in one instance.
Sir Arthur Haflerig, John Hampden, Oli-
ver Cromwell, and some other persons
whole principles and views coincided with
theirs, impatient to enjoy those civil and
religious liberties which they struggled ih
vain to obtain in Great Britain, hired some
lhips to carry them and their attendants to
New England. By order of council, an
embargo was laid on these when on the
point of failing; and Charles, far from
fufpeling that the future revolutions in his
kingdoms were to be excited and directed

J5 by

by persons in such an humble sphere of B O O K
life, forcibly detained the men destined to .'
overturn his throne, and to terminate his
days by a violent death *.

BUT, in spite of all the efforts of govern-

ment to check this spirit of migration, the
measures of the king and his ministers
were confidered by a great body of the
people as so hostile to those rights which
they deemed most valuable, that in the
course of the year one thousand fix hun-

phoofing rather to expose themselves to
all the consequences of disregarding the
royal pro;laination, than to remain longer

to a violent but effectual mode of accom-

that all the motives for migrating to the B 0 OX'

new world ceased. The maxims of the i. -
Puritans with refpe&t to the government
both of church and itate, became predomi-
nant in the nation, and were enforced by
the hand of power. Their apprefl'ors were
humbled; that perse& system of reform-
ed polity, which had long been the objec
of their admiration and desire, was efta-
blifhed by law; and amidst the intrigues
and conflits of an obstinate civil war, tur-
bulent and aspiring spirits found such full
occupation, that they had no inducement
to quit a busy theatre, on which they had
risen to ad a most conspicuous part. From
the year one thousand fix hundred and
twenty, when the first feeble colony was
conducted to New England by the Brown- State of
iRs, to the year one thousand fix hundred ioatthis
and forty, it has been 'computed, that eriod.
twenty-one thousand two hundred Britifl
fubjeas had fettled there. The money ex-
pended by various adventurers during that
period in fitting out ships, in purchasing

stock,

AmJ on a moderate calculation, nearly to two

hundred thousand pounds *: a vat fum in
that age, and which no principles, inferior
in force to those wherewith the Puritans
were animated, could have persuaded men
to lay out, on the uncertain profpea of ob-
taining an establishment in a remote uncul-
tivated region, which, from its situation
and climate, could allure them with no hope
but that of finding subsistence and enjoy-
ing freedom. For fqme years, even sub-
fiftence was procured with difficulty; and
it was towards the cloe of the period to
which our narrative is arrived, before the
product of the fettlemert yielded the plant-
ers any return for their Rock, About that
time they began to export coin in small
quantities to the Weft Indies, and made
some feeble attempts to extend the fiflery,
and to open the trade in lumber, which

one thousand fix hundred and forty, the .

BUT though the sudden change offyftem

the colonists coincided so perfetly with

made rapid progress in all the diftri&s of
New England, and population increased

tion, prayed for the success of its arms,
and framed regulations in order to prevent

RELYING on the indulgent partialitywith

which all their proceedings were viewed by
men thus closely unitedwith them in senti-

increased their security and power, but may
be regarded as a considerable ftep towards
independence. Under the impreflion or

famous bond of union among the Dutch

that the confederates should henceforth be
distinguished by the name of the United
Colonies of New England; that each colo-
ny shall remain separate and distinCt, and
have exclusive jurifdiltion within its own
territory; that in every war offensive or

furnish its quota of men, provisions, and

In this tranfadion the colonies of New Eng-
land seem to have confidered themselves
as independent societies, poffefling all the
rights of sovereignty, and free from the
controul of any superior power. The go-
verning party in England, occupied with
affairs of more urgent concern, and no wife
dilpofed to observe the conduc of their

out animadversion.
