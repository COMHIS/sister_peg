# PREFACE.

PREFAC E.

nHI, perusal of Major Rennell's Memoir for
illulsrating his Map of Indoflan, one of the

inoft valuable geographical treatises that has ap-
peared in any age or country, gave rife to the fol-
lowing work. It suggested to me the idea of
examining more fully than I had done in the In-
trodudory Book to my History of America, into
the knowledge which the Ancients had of India,
and of confidering what is certain, what is ob-
fcure, and what is fabulous, in the accounts of
that country which they have handed down to us.
In undertaking this inquiry, I had originally no
other objec than my own amusement and inftruc-
tion: But in carrying it on, and consulting with
diligence the authors of antiquity, some fads,
hitherto unobserved, and many which had not
been examined with proper attention, occurred,
new views opened; my ideas gradually extended
and became more interesting; until, at length,
I imagined that the result of my researches might
prove amusing and inftrudive to others, by ex-
hibiting such a view of the various modes in

A a which

which intercourse with India had been carried on
from the earliest times, as might {hew how much
that great branch of commerce has contributed,
in every age, to increase the wealth and power of
the nations which pofleffed if.

TIHIs the Historical Difqluifition which I norw

lay before the Reader was begun and completed.
What degree of merit it poilTefes, the Public
must determine. My grateful recollection of the
favourable manner in which my other works have
been received, naturally increases the solicitude
with which I wait for its decision concerning this
whicl I now publish.

W-THEN I first turned my thoughts to this sub-

jee, I was so fully aware of the disadvantage
under which I laboured in undertaking to de-
fcribc countries of which I had not any local
knowledge, that I have been at the utmost pains
to guard againitL any errors which this might oc-
calion. I have conlulted, with persevering in-
dupfry, the works of all the authors I could pro-
cure, who have given any account of India; I
have never formed any decided opinion, which
was not supported by refpedable authority; and
as I have the good fortune to reckon among the
number of my friends some Gentlemen who have
filled important ntations, civil and military, in

G~~~~~~6 ~India,

India, and who have visited many different patts
of it, I had recourse frequently to them, and from
their conversation learned things which I could
nut have found in books. Were it proper to
mention their names, the Public would allow
that by their discernment and abilities they are
fully entitled to the confidence which I have
placed in them.

IN the progress of the work, I became fen.

fible of my own deficiency with refpe't to an-
other point. In order to give an accurate idea
of the imperfecion both of the theory and prac-
tice of navigation among the Ancients, and to
explain, with scientific precision, the manner in
which they ascertained the position of places,
and calculated their longitude and latitude, a
greater portion of mathematical knowledge was
requisite, than my attention to other fludies had
permitted me to acquire. What I wanted, the
friendlhip of my ingenious and refpecable Col-
league, Mr. Playfair, Professor of Mathematics,
has supplied; and I have been enabled by him to
elucidate all the points I have mentioned, in a
manner which, I am confident, will afford my
Readers complete fatisfation. To him, likc-
wife, I am indebted for the colnfrucion of two
maps necessary for illui-rating this Disquisition,
which without liis afliflancc I could not have
u rdertaken. ,.

1 HAVE

I HAVE adhered, in this work, to an arrange-

ment I followed in my former compositions, and
to which the Public has been long accutfomed.
I have kept hiflorical narrative as much separate
as possible from scientific and critical discussions,
by reserving the latter for Notes and Illustrations.
I flatter myself that I may claim, without pre-
fumption, the merit of having examined with
diligence what I submit to public infpeaion,
and of having referred, with scrupulous ac-
curacy, to the authors from whom I have derived
information.

SECTION I.
Intercourse with India, from the earliest Times,

until the Conquest of Egypt by the Romnans.
W"? HOEVER attempts to trace the ope- s E c T.

rations of men in remote times, and I.

to mark the various Rteps of their progress Y
in any line of exertion, will soon have the
mortification to find, that the period of au.
thentic history is extremely limited. It is little
more than three thousand years since the
Books of Moses, the most ancient and only
genuine record of what passed in the early
ages of the world, were composed. Hero-
dotus, the nmof ancient Heathen historian whose
works have reached us, flourished a thousand

B years

S E C T. years later. If we push our inquiries concern-

*. ing any point beyond the aera where written
- *- history commences, we enter upon the region

of 'conjeture, of fable, and of uncertainty.
Upon that ground I will neither venture my-
self, nor endeavour to conduct my readers.
In my researches concerning the intercourse
between the Eastern and Western regions of
the earth, and concerning the progress of that
great branch of trade, which, in every age,
has contributed so conspicuously towards raising
the people who carried it on, to wealth and
power, I (hall confine myself within the pre-
cinEts I have marked out. Wherever the in-
spired writers, intent upon higher objects.
mention occasionally any circumstance that tends
to. illustrate the subjet of my inquiries, I shall
attend to it with reverence. Whatever other
writers relate, I shall examine with freedom,
and endeavour to ascertain the degree of credit
to which they are entitled.

'THE original flation allotted to man by his

Creator, was in the mild and fertile regions of
the East. There the human race began its
career of improvement; and from the remains
of sciences which were anciently cultivated, as
well as of arts which were anciently exercised in
India, we may conclude it to be one of the
first countries in which men made any con-

fiderable

fiderable progress in that career. The wisdom s E c T.
of the East was early celebrated a, and its pro. i.
dudtions were early in request among distant -
nations b. The intercourse, however, between
different countries was carried on at first en-
tirely by land. As the people of. the East ap-
pear loon to have acquired complete dominion
over the useful animals c, they could early un-
dertake the long and toilsome journies which
it was necessary to make, in order to maintain
this intercourse; and by the provident bounty
of Heaven, they were furnished with a beast
of burden, without whose aid it would have
been impoflible to accomplish them. The
Camel, by its persevering ftrengtb, by its mo-
deration in the use of food, and the singularity
of its internal ftruEture, which enables it to
lay in a flock of water sufficient for several
days, put it in their power to convey bulky
commodities through those deserts, which must
be traversed by all who travel from any of the
countries weft of the Euphrates towards India.
Trade was carried on in this manner, parti-
cularly by the nations near to the Arabian
Gulf, from the earliest period to which his-
torical information reaches. Distant journies,
however, would be undertaken at first only

s E C T. occasionally, and by a few adventurers. But

by degrees, from attention to their mutual safety
-Tr and comfort, numerous bodies of merchants

assembled at Rtated times, and forming a tem-
porary association, (known afterwards by the
name of a Caravan,) governed by officers of
their own choice, and subjed to regulations of
which experience had taught them the utility,
they performed journies'of such extent and du.
ration, as appear astonishing to nations not accuf-
tomed to this mode of carrying on commerce.

BUT, notwithstanding every improvement

that could be made in the manner of convey-
ing the producions of one country to another
by land, the inconveniencies which attended
it were obvious and unavoidable. It was often
dangerous; always expensive, and tedious, and
fatiguing. A method of communication more
easy and expeditious was fought, and the in-
genuity of man gradually discovered, that the
rivers, the arms of the sea, and even the ocean
itself, were destined to open and facilitate in.
tercourfe with the various regions of the earth,
between which they appear, at firfl view, to
be placed as insuperable barriers. Navigation,
however, and ship-building, (as I have ob-
lfrved in another work d,) are arts so nice and

compli.

complicated, that they require the talents as s E c T
well as experience of many fucceflive ages, to I.
bring them to any degree of perfeeion. From ~-
the raft or canoe, which first served to carry a
savage over the river that obflruded him in
tie chace,' to the conitruetion of a vessel ca-
pable of conveying a numerous crew, or a con-
fiderable cargo of goods, to a distant coast,
the progress of improvement is immense. Many,
efforts would be made, many experiments
would be tried, and much labour as well as
ingenuity would be employed, before this ar-
duous and important undertaking could be ac-
complifled.

EVEN after some improvement was made in

ship-building, the intercourse of nations with
each other by sea was far from being extensive.
From the accounts of the earliefl hiltorians,
we learn, that navigation made its fir(t efforts
in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf,
and in them the first active operations of com-
inerce were carried on. From an attentive in-
fpedion of the position and form of there two
great inland seas, there accounts appear to be
highly probable. These seas lay open the con-
tinents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and spread.
ing to a great extent along the coafis of the
rnoft fertile and most early civilized countries
in each, fecm to have been dctlined by nature

13 to

S E C T. to facilitate their communication with one an-

other. We find, accordingly, that the first voy-
IDrS ages of the Egyptians and Phenicians, the nmolt

ancient navigators mentioned in history, were
made in the Mediterranean. Their trade, how-
ever, was not long confined to the countries
bordering upon it. By acquiring early posses-
sion of ports on the Arabian Gulf, they extended
the sphere of their commerce, and are repre-
sented as the first people of the Weft who opened
a communication by sea with India.

IN that account of the progress of navigation

and discovery which I prefixed to the History
of America, I confidered with attention the ma-
ritime operations of the Egyptians and Pheni-
cians; a brief review of them here, as far as
they relate to their connescion with India, is all
that is requisite for illuflraring the subjet of my
present inquiries. With refpe&t to the former
of these people, the information which hiltory
affords is slender, and of doubtful authority.
The fertile foil and mild climate of Egypt pro-
duced the necessaries and comforts of life in such
profusion, as to render its inhabitants so inde-
pendent of other countries, that it became carly
an eflabli(hed maxim in their policy, to renounce
all intercourse with foreigners. In consequence
of this, they held all sea-faring persons in dc-

teftation,

teftation, as impious and profane; and fortify- s E C T.
ing their harbours, they denied strangers admif- I
sion into them .

THE enterprising ambition of Sefoftris, dif-

daining the refiraints imposed upon it by these
contraced ideas of his fubjeds, prompted him
to render the Egyptians a commercial people;
and in the course of his reign he so completely
accomplished this, that (if we may give credit
to some Historians) he was able to fit out a
fleet of four hundred ships in the Arabian Gulf,
which conquered all the countries itretching
along the Erythrean sea to India. At the fame
time, his army, led by himself, marched through
Asia, and fubjeted to his dominion every part
of it as far as to the banks of the Ganges; and
crossing that river, advanced to the Eastern
Ocean'. But there efforts produced no per-
manent effect, and appear to have been so
contrary to the genius and habits of the Egyp-
tians, that, on the death of Sefoftris, they re-
fumed their ancient maxims, and many ages
elapsed before the commercial connection of

B 4 Egypt

s E C T. Egypt with India came to be of such importance

hs as to merit any notice in this Disquisition g.

THE history of the early maritime operations

of Phenicia are not involved in the fame ob-
fcurity with those of Egypt. Every circum-
fiance in the character and iituation of the Phe-
nicians was favourable to the commercial spirit.
The territory which they poeffefed was neither
large nor fertile. It was from commerce only
that they could derive either opulence or power.
Accordingly, the trade carried on by the Phe-
nicians of Sidon and Tyre, was extensive and
adventurous; and, both in their manners and
policy, they resemble the great commercial
states .of modern times, more than any people in
the ancient world. Among the various branches
of their commerce, that with India may be re.
garded as one of the most considerable and most
lucrative. As by their situation on the Medi-
terranean, and the imperfect fate of navigation,
they could not attempt to open a direA com-
munication with India by sea; the enterprizing
spirit of commerce prompted them to wrefi
from the Idumaxans tome commodious lar-
bours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulf.
From these they held a regular intercourse

with

with India on the one hand, and with the Eastern s E c T.
and Southern coasts of Africa on the other. i,
The distance, however, from the Arabian Gulf ~-'-
to Tyre was considerable, and rendered the
conveyance of goods to it by land carriage so
tedious and expcnfive, that it became neceflary
for therii to take poffefion of Rhinocolura,
the nearest port in the IMediterranean to the
Arabian Gulf. Thither all the commodities
brought from India were conveyed over land
by a route much shorter, and more prac'i-
cable, than that by which the productions of the
East were carried at a subsequent period from
the opposite shore of the Arabian Gulf to the
Nile h. At Rhinocolura they were refhipped,
and transported by an easy navigation to Tyre,
and distributed through the world. This, as
it is the earliest route of communication with
India of which we have any authentic defcrip-
tion, had so many advantages over any ever
known before the modern discovery of a new
course of navigation to the East, that the Phe-
nicians could supply other nations with the pro-
ductions of India in greater abundance, and at
a cheaper rate, than any people of antiquity.
To this circumflance, which, for a considerable
time, secured to them a monopoly of that

s E c T. trade, was owing, not only the extraordinary

I- wealth of individuals, which rendered the
-'- " merchants of Tyre, Princes, and her traf-

" sickers the Honourable of the Earth i;" but
the extensive power of the state itself, which
firfl taught mankind to conceive what vall re-
sources a commercial people possess, and what
great exertions they are capable of making k,

THE Jews, by their vicinity to Tyre, had

such an opportunity of observing the wealth
which flowed into that city from the lucrative
commerce carried on by the Phenicians from
their settlements on the Arabian Gulf, as incited
them to aim at obtaining some Ihare of it.
This they effeted under the prosperous reigns
of David and Solomon, partly by the conquests
which they made of a small diftrit in the land
of Edom, that gave them possession of the har-
bours of Elath and Efiongeber on the Red Sea,
and partly by the friendship of Hiram, king
of Tyre; who enabled Solomon to fit out fleets,
which, under the direction of Phenician pilots,
failed to Tarfhisi and Ophir'. In what re-
gion of the earth we should search for there

Solomon with the various commodities enu- s E C T.
merated by the sacred historians, is an inquiry I.
that has long exercised the indultry of learned
men. They were early supposed to be situated
in some part of India, and the Jews were held
to be one of the nations which traded with that
country. But the opinion more generally adopt-
ed is, that Solomon's fleets, after passing the
straits of Babelmandeb, held their course along
the south-west coast of Africa, as far as the
kingdom of Sofala, a country celebrated for
its rich mines of gold and silver, (from which
it has been denominated the Golden Sofala by
Oriental writers'",) and abounding in all the
other articles which composed the cargoes of the
Jewish ships. This opinion, which the accurate
researches of M. D'Anville rendered highly pro-
bable", seems now to be established with the
utmost certainty by a late learned traveller;
who, by his knowledge of the monsoons in the
Arabian Gulf, and his attention to the ancient
mode of navigation, both in that sea and along
the African coast, has not only accounted for
the extraordinary length of time which the fleets
of Solomon took in going and returning, but
has flewn, from circumstances mentioned con.

cerning

sL c r. cerning the voyage, that it was not made to

A. any place in India °. The Jews, then, we may
Ly ~conclude, have no title to be reckoned among

the nations which carried on intercourse with
India by sea; and if, from deference to the fen-
timents of some respectable authors, their claim
were to be admitted, we know with certainty,
that the commercial effort which they made in
the reign of Solomon was merely a transient one,
and that they quickly returned to their former
state of unsocial seclusion from the reft of man-
kind.

FROMr colleting the scanty information which

history affbrds, concerning the most early at-
tempts to open a commercial intercourse with
India, I now proceed, with more certainty and
greater confidence, to trace the progress of com-
munication with that country, under the guid-
ance of authors who recorded events nearer to
their own times, and with refpeEt to which,
they had received more full and accurate intel.
ligence.

meriting any degree of credit, is that of the
P1crfans; and even of this we have only a very

general and doubtful account. Darius, the son s E c T.
of Hyftafpes, though raised to the throne of i.
Persia by chance or by artifice, poffefied such -r
a&ive and enterprizing talents, as rendered him
worthy of that high Ration. He examined the
different provinces of his kingdom more dili-
gently than any of his predecessors, and ex-
plored regions of Asia formerly little known .
Having fubjeded to his dominion many of the
countries which firetched south-east from the
Caspian sea towards the river Oxus, his curio-
fity was excited to acquire a more extensive and
accurate knowledge of India, on which they
bordered. With this view he appointed Scylax
of Caryandra to take the command of a fqua-
dron fitted out at Cafpatyrus, in the country of
Patya, '[the modern Pehkely,] towards the
upper part of the navigable course of the river
Indus, and to fall down its fiream until he should
reach the ocean. This Scylax performed, though
it ihould seem with much difficulty, and not-
witliftanding many obstacles; for he spent no
less than two years and fix months in conducing
his squadron from the place where he embarked,
to the Arabian Gulf1. 'he account which he
gave of the populousness, fertility, and high
cultivation of that region of India through
which his courie lay, rendered Darius impatient

1. This he soon accomplished; and though his
V-' conquefis in India seem not to have extended

beyond the district watered by the Indus, we
are led to form an high idea of its opulence, as
well as of the number of its inhabitants, in an-
cient times, when we learn that the tribute
which he levied from it was near a third part
of the whole revenue of the Persian monarchy r
But neither this voyage of Scylax, nor the con-
quests of Darius, to which it gave rife, diffused
any general knowledge of India. The Greeks,
who were the only enlightened race of men at
that time in Europe, paid but little attention to
the tranfacdions of the people whom they confi-
dered as Barbarians, especially in countries far
remote from their own; and Scylax had embel-
lifhed the narrative of his voyage with so many
circumstances manifestly fabulous ", that he
seems to have met with the just punishment to
which persons who have a notorious propensity
to what is marvellous arc often fubjeEed, of
being listened to with distrust, even when they
relate what is exadtly true.

undertook

undertook his expedition into India. The wild s E c T.
sallies of paflion, the indecent excesses of intem- '
perance, and the ostentatious displays of vanity
too frequent in the conduct of this extraor-
dinary man, have so degraded his character,
that the pre-eminence of his merit, either as a
conqueror, a politician, or a legislator, has fel-
dom been justly estimated. The subjet of my
present inquiry leads me to confider his opera-
tions only in one light, but it will enable me to
exhibit a itriking view of the grandeur and ex-
tent of his plans. He seems, soon after his first
fuccefles in Asia, to have formed the idea of
establishing an universal monarchy, and aspired
to the dominion of the sea, as well as of the
land. From the wonderful efforts of the Ty.
rians in fheir own defence, when left without
any ally or protetor, he conceived an high opi-
nion of the resources of maritime power, and of
the wealth to be derived from commerce, efpe-
cially that with India, which he found engrofled
by the citizens of Tyre. With a view to secure
this commerce, and to establish a fiation for it,
preferable in many refpeEt to that of Tyre, as
soon as he completed the conquefl of Egypt, he
founded a city near one of the mouths of the
Nile, which he honoured with his own name;
and with such admirable difcerninent was the
situation of it chofcn, that Alexandria soon be-
came the grcateft trading city in the ancient

world;

S E C T. world; and, notwithltanding many fucceflive

revolutions in empire, continued, during. eigh-
teen centuries, to be the chief feat of commerce
with India . Amidst the military operations to
which Alexander was soon obliged to turn his
attention, the desire of acquiring the lucrative
commerce which the Tyrians had carried on
witi India, was not relinquished. Events soon
occurred, that not only confirmed and added
firength to this dclire, but opened to him a
profpet of obtaining the sovereignty of those
regions which supplied the reft of mankind with
so many precious commodities.

AFTER his final victory over the Persians, he

was led in pursuit of the last Darius, and of
Beil's, the murderer of that unfortunate mo-
narch, to traverse that part of Asia which
Wretches fromn the Caspian sea beyond the river
Oxus. He advanced towards the east as far as
Maracanda , then a city of some note, and
deflined, in a future period, under the modern
name of Samarcand, to be the capital of an em-
pire not inferior to his own either in extent or in
power. In a progress of several months through
provinces hitherto unknown to the Greeks, in a
line of march often approaching near to India,

course with it, he learned many things concern- s E c T.
ing the state of a country that had been long I-
the object of his thoughts and wifhesy, which
increased his desire of invading it. Decisive and
prompt in all his resolutions, he set out from
Badria, and crossed that ridge of mountains
which, under various denominations, forms the
Stony Girdle (if I may use an expreflion of the
Oriental geographers) which encircles Asia, and
constitutes the northern barrier of India.

THE most practicable avenue to every coun-

try, it is obvious, must be formed by circum-
flances in its natural situation, such as the defiles
which lead through mountains, the course of
rivers, and the places where they may be passed
with the greatest ease and safety. In no place
of the earth is this line of approach marked and
defined more conspicuously, than on the north-
ern frontier of India; insomuch that the three
great invaders of this country, Alexander,
Tamerlane, and Nadir Shah, in three distant
ages, and with views and talents extremely dif.
ferent, advanced by the fame route, with very
little deviation. Alexander had the merit of
having firIt discovered the way. After pafring
the rountains, he encamped at Alexandria

crossed the river at Taxila, now Attock, where
its fiream is io tranquil that a bridge can be
thrown over it with greater ease than at any

AFTER pafling the Indus, Alexander marched

forward in the road which leads directly to the
Ganges, and the opulent provinces to the south-
east, now comprehended under the general name
of Indoftan. But, on the banks of the Hydaf-
pes, known in modern times by the name of
the Betah or Chelum, he was opposed by
Porus, a powerful monarch of the country, at
the head of a numerous army. The war with
Porus, and tihe hostilities in which he was fuc-
cclhivcly engaged with other Indian princes, led
him to deviate from his original route, and to
turn more towards the south-west. .n carrying
on thclf operations, Alexander marched through

India, now called the Panjab, from the five

great rivers by which it is watered; and as we s F C T.
know that this march was performed in the I'
rainy season, when even Indian armies cannot
keep the field, it gives an high idea both of
Alexander's persevering spirit, and of the ex-
traordinary vigour and hardiness of constitution
which soldiers, in ancient times, derived from
the united effeCts of gymnastic exercise and mi-
litary discipline. In every ftep of his progress,
objects no less striking than new presented
themselves to Alexander. The magnitude of
the Indus, even after he had seen the Nile, the
Euphrates, and the Tigris, muff have filled him
with surprise b. No country he had hitherto
visited was so populous and well cultivated, or
abounded in so many valuable productions of
nature and of art, as that part of India through
which he had led his army, But when he was
info:med in every place, and probably with ex-
aggerated description, how much the Indus was
inferior to the Ganges, and how far all that he
had hitherto beheld was filrpatfld il the happy
regions through which that great river flows, it
is not wonderful that his eagerness to view and
to take poffeflion of them flhould have prompted
him to affcmble his soldiers, and to propose that
they should resume their march towards that

awaited them. But they had already done so
much, and had fufifred so greatly, especially
froni incessant rains and extensive inundations,
that their patience as well as strength vere ex-
hauftedC, and with one voice they refused to
advance farther. In this resolution they pcr-
sifted with such fullen obflinacy, that Alexander,
though pofretlcd in the highcft degree of every
quality that gains an ascendant over the minds
of military men, was obliged to yield, and to
ifue orders for marching back to Persia '

rTl E scene of this memorable tranfacdion was

on the banks of the Hyphafis, the modern
Beyah, which was the.utmoft limit of Alexander's
progress in India. From this it is manifest, that
,he did not traverse the whole extent of the Pan-
jab. Its fouth-welt boundary is formed by a
river anciently known by the name of II!f;-

Alexander never app)roached nearer than the

three hundred and feventy-three years after 1.
Alexander's expedition . The breadth of the ^
Panjab, from Ludhana on the Sctlege to Attock
on the Indus, is computed to be two hundred
and fifty-nine geographical miles, in a straight
line; and Alexander's march, computed in the
fame manner, did not extend above two hin-
dred miles. But, both as he advanced ald
returned, his troops were so spread over the
country, and often atted in so many separate

measured and delineated by men of science,
whom he kept in pay for the purpose, that he
acquired a very extensive and accurate know-
ledge of that part of India .

cers to whom he had given it in charge to build

cuted his orders with such ativity and success
that they had assembled a numerous fleet. As
amid ft the hurry of war, and the rage of con-
quefi, he never loft fight of his pacific and

fleet was to fail down the Indus to the ocean,

THE conduct of this expedition was comn-

mitied to Nearchus, an officer equal to that
important trult. But as Alexander was ambitious
to acquire fame of every kind, and fond of en-
gaging in new and splendid undertakings, he
himself accompanied Nearchus in his navigation
down the liver. The armament was, indeed,
so great and magnificent, as deferred to be
commanded by the conqueror of Asia. It was

ALEXANDER'S progress in India, in this line s E C T.

of diretion, was far more confidcrable than
that which he made by the route we formerly
traced; and when we attend to the various
movements of his troops, the number of cities
which they took, and the different states which
they subdued, he may be said not only to have
viewed, but to have explored, the countries
through which he pafled. This part of India
has been so little frcquented by Europeans in
later times, that neither the position of places,
nor their distances, can be ascertained wvith the
fame accuracy as in the interior provinces, or
even in the Panjab. But from the researches
of Major Rennell, carried on with no less dif-
cernment than industry, the distance of that
place on the Hydafpes, where Alexander fitted
out his fleet from the ocean, cannot be lets than
a thousand British miles. Of this extensive
region a considerable portion, particularly the
upper Delta, stretching from the capital of the
ancient Malli, now Moultan, to Patala, the
modern Tatta, is diflinguithcd i;)r its fertility
and population'.

SOON after he reached the ocean, Alexander,
satisfied with having accompllifhed this arduous

S E C T. undertaking, led his army by land back to

I- Persia. The command of the fleet, with a con-
L'*'J fiderable body of troops on board of it, he left

to Nearchus, who, after a coafling voyage of
seven months, conducted it safely up the Persian
Gulf into the Euphrates k

IN this manner did Alexander first open the

knowledge of India to the people of Europe,
and an extensive difirid of it was surveyed with
greater accuracy than could have been expe&ted
from the short time he remained in that country.
Fortunately an exact account, not only of his
military operations, but of every thing worthy
of notice in the countries where they were car-
ried on, was recorded in the Memoirs or Jour-
nals of three of.his principal officers, Ptolemy,
the son of Lagus, Ariilobulus, and Nearchus.
The two former have not indeed reached our
times, but it is probable that the moll important
fads which they contained are preserved, as
Arrian profefics to have followed them as his
guides il his Hiilory of the Expedition of Alex-
ander '; a work which, though composed long
after Greece had loft its liberty, and in an age
when genius and tafe were on the decline, is not
unworthy the purest tinimc of Attic literature.

'WITH refpet to the general state of India, s E c T,

we learn from there writers, that in the age of 1-
Alexander, though there was not eftablilhed ^
in it any powerful empire, resembling that
which in modern times firetched its dominion
from the Indus almofi to Cape Comorin, it
was even then formed into monarchies of
considerable extent. The king of the Prafij
was ,prepared on the banks of the Ganges to
oppose the Macedonians, with an army of twenty
thousand cavalry, two hundred thousand in-
fantry, two thousand armed chariots, and a
great number of elephants m. The territory of
which Alexander constituted Porus the sovereign,
is said to have contained seven diftind nations,
and no fewer than two thousand towns ". Even
in the most reflrited sense that can be given
to the vague indefinite appellations of nations
and towns, an idea is conveyed of a very great
degree of population. As the fleet failed down
the river, the country on each fide was found
to be in no refpcc inferior to that of which
the government was committed to Porus.

lame officers that Europe derived its first

the descriptions given by Alexander's officers

other particulars, in all which they perfeltly

any detail with rcfpet to these in this place
vould be premature; but as the fubjcc, though
curious and intcrefting, will lead unavoidably
into difcuflion$ not well suited to the nature of

an hiflorical work, I shall reserve my ideas s E T,
concerning it for an Appendix, to be annexed
to this Disquisition; and hope they may con-
tribute to throw some additional light upon
the origin and nature of the commerce with
India.

MUCH as the Western world was indebted

for its knowledge of India to the expedition
of Alexander, it was only a finall portion of
that vast continent which he explored. His
operations did not extend beyond the modern
province of Lahore, and the countries on the
banks of the Indus from Moultan to the sea.
These, however, were surveyed with that degree
of accuracy which I have already described; and
it is a circurmftance not unworthy of notice,
that this diftric of India which Europeans
first entered, and with which they were belt
acquainted in ancient times, is now less known
than almost any part of that continent , neither
commerce nor war, to which, in every age,
geography is chiefly indebted for its improver
incnt, having led any nation of Europe to fre-
quent or explore it.

s E C T. have reason to think, would have been more

I. fully explored by the ancients, and the Euro-
s^ - pean dominion would have been established

there two thousand years sooner. When Alex-
ander invaded India, he had something more
in view than a transient incursion. It was his
object to annex that extensive and opulent
country to his empire; and though the refractory
spirit of his army obliged him, at that time, to
flfpend the prosecution of his plan, he was
far from relinquishing it. To exhibit a general
view of the measures which he adopted for
this purpose, and to point out their propriety
and probable success, is not foreign from the
iubjet of this Disquisition, and will convey a
more just idea than is usually entertained, of
the original genius and extent of political wis-
dom which distinguished this illustrious man.

WHEN Alexander became mafler of the Per.

fian empire, he early perceived, that with all the
power of his hereditary dominions, re-inforced
by the troops which the ascendant he had ac.
quired over the various states of Greece might
enable him to raise there, he could not hope
to retain in fubjedion territories so. extensive
and populous; that to render his authority
I;cure and pernmanent, it muff be eftabliflhed
in the affcdion of the nations which he had

fuL)bducd,

subdued, and maintained by their arms; and s E c T,
that in order to' acquire this advantage, all dif- I-
tinEtions between the viaors and vanquished must
be abolished, and his European and Asiatic sub-
jets must be incorporated, and become one peo-
ple, by obeying the fame laws, and by adopting
the fame manners, institutions, and discipline.

LIBERAL as this plan of policy was, and well

adapted to accomplish what he had in view,
nothing could be more repugnant to the ideas
and prejudices of his countrymen. The Greeks
had such an high opinion of the pre-eminence
to which they were raised by civilization and
icience, that they seem hardly to have acknow-
ledged the reft of mankind to be of the fame
species with themselves. To every other people
they gave the degrading appellation of Barba-
rians, and, in conf2quence of their own boasted
superiority, they aficrted a right of dominion
over them, in the fame manner (to use their own
expreflion) as the foul has over the body, and
men have over irrational animals. Extravagant
as this pretension may now appear, it fomul
admiilion, to the disgrace of ancient philofoph!,
into all the schools. Aristotle, full of this
opinion, in support of which he employs argu-
ments moie subtle than solid P, advised Alcx-

andier

S E C T. ander to govern the Greeks like fubjeEts, and

ti the Barbarians as slaves; to confider the former

as companions, the lattter as creatures of an in-
ferior nature '. But the sentiments of the
pupil were more enlarged than those of his
matter, and his experience in governing men
taught the monarch what the speculative science
of the philosopher did not discover. Soon
after the viaory at Arbela, Alexander him-
felt, and, by his persuasion, many of his officers,
affuned thl Persian dress, and conformed
to fevcral of their customs. At the fame
time he encouraged the Persian nobles to
imitate the manners of the Macedonians, to
learn the Greek language, and to acquire a
relish for the beauties of the elegant writers
in that tongue, which were then universally
fludied and admired. In order to render the
union more complete, he resolved to marry one
of the daughters of Darius, and chose wives
for a hundred of his principal officers in the
noft illustrious Persian families. Tlheir nup-
tials were celebrated with great pomp and
feftiviy, and with high exultation of the con-
quercd people. In imitation of them, above
ten thoulfind l aJIcedonians of inferior rank mar-
ried Persian women, to each of whom Alexander

gave

gave nuptial presents, as a testimony of his ap- s E c r.
probation of their conduct .

BUT assiduously as Alexander laboured to

unite his European and Afritic fubjets by the
most indifoluble ties, he did not trust entirely
to the success of that measure for the security
of his new conquers. In every province
which he subdued, he made choice of proper
stations, where he built and fortified cities, in
which he placed garrisons, composed partly of
such of the natives as conformed to the Gre-
cian manners and discipline, and partly of such
of his European fubjeas as were worn out
with the fatigues of service, and wished for
repose, and a permanent establishment. These
cities were numerous, and served not only as
a chain of pofis to keep open the communica-
tion between the different provinces of his do-
minions, but as places of firength to over.awe
and curb the conquered people. Thirty thou-
sand of his new fubjels, who had been dif-
ciplined in these cities, and armed after the
European fashion, appeared before Alexander
in Susa, and were formed by him into that

compact

s E C T. compaa solid body of infantry, known by the

name of the Phalanx, which constituted the
t irength of a Mlacedonian army. But in order
to secure entire authority over this new corps,
as well as to render it more effective, he ap-
pointed that every officer in it entrufled with
command, either superior or subaltern, thould
be European. As the ingenuity of mankind
naturally has recourse in similar situations to
the fame expedients, the European powers, who
now in their Indian territories employ numerous
bodies of the natives in their service, have, in
forming the establishment of these troops,
adopted the fame maxims; and, probably with-
out knowing it, have modelled their battalions
of Seapoys upon the fame principles as Alex-
ander did his Phalanx of Persians.

THE farther Alexander puffed his conquets

from the banks of the Euphrates, which may
be confidered as the centre of his dominions,
he found it necessary to build and to fortify a
greater number of cities. Several of there to
the Ealt and South of the Caspian sea are men.
tioned by ancient authors; and in India itself,
he founded two cities on the banks of the Hty-
dafpes, and a third -on the Acefines, both na-
vigable rivers, which, after uniting their fireams,

fall

fall into the Indus9. From the choice of s E C T.
such situations, it is obvious that he intended, I'
by means of these cities, to keep open a com-
munication with India, not only by land, but
by sea. It was chiefly with a view to the latter
of these objects, (as I have already observed,) that
he examined the navigation of the Indus with so
much attention. With the fame view, on his re-
turn to Susa, he, in person, surveyed the course
of the Euphrates and Tigris, and gave directions
to remove the catarasts or dams, with which the
ancient monarchs of Persia, induced by a pe-
culiar precept of their religion, which enjoined
them to guard with the utmost care against
defiling any of the elements, had constru&ed
near the mouths of these rivers, in order to
shut out their .subje1s from any access to the
ocean'. By opening the navigation in this
manner, he proposed, that the valuable com-
modities of India should be conveyed from
the Persian Gulf into the interior parts of
his Asiatic dominions, while by the Arabian
Gulf they should be carried to Alexandria, and
distributed to the reft of the world.

S E C T. GR1AND and extensive as *thefefchemes were,

-. the precautions employed, and the arrange-

ments made for carrying them into execution,
were so various and so proper, that Alexander
had good reason to entertain sanguine hopes
of their proving successful, At the time when
the mutinous spirit of his soldiers obliged him
to reilihquifh his operations in India, he wvas
not thirty years of age complete. :At- this en-
terprizing period of' life, a prince, of' a pirit

intent. If he had invaded India a second
time, he would not, as formerly, have been
obliged to force his way through hostile and
unexplored regions, opposed at every rsep by
nations and tribes of Barbarians, whose names
had never reached Greece. All Asia, from
the shores of the Ionian tea to the banks of
the Hyphafis, would then have been 'subjet
to his dominion; and through that immense
firetch of country he had efablifhed such a
chain of cities, or fortified tfations', that his
armies might have continued their march with
safety, and have found a regular fucceflion of
magazines provided for their subsistence. Nor

would it have been difficult for him to bring s E C T.
into the field forces sufficient to have atchieved
the conquert of a country so populous and ex-
tensive as India. Having armed and difci-
plined his fubjedts in the East like Europeans,
they Would have been ambitious to imitate
and to equal their inftru&ors, and Alexander
might have drawn recruits, not from his scanty
domains in Macedonia and Greece, but from
the vast regions of Asia, which, in every age,
has covered the earth, and astonished man-
kind with its numerous armies. When at the
head of such a formidable power he had reached
the confines of India, he might have entered
it under circumstances, very different from
those in his first expedition. He had secured
a firm footing- there, partly by means of the
garrisons that he left in the three cities which
he had built and fortified3 and partly by his
alliance with Taxiles and Porus. These two
Indian princes, won by Alexander's humanity
and beneficence, which, as they were virtues
seldom displayed in the ancient mode of car-
rying on War, excited of course an higher
degree of admiration and gratitude, had conti-
nued feady in their attachment to the Mace-
donians. Re-inforced by their troops, and
guided by their information as well as by the
experience which he had acquired in his

rapid progress in a country, where every in-
vader, from his time to the present age, has
proved successful.

BUT this and all his other splendid schemes

were terminated at once by his untimely death.
In consequence of that, however, events took
place, which illuflrate and confirm the justness
of the preceding ipeculations and conjectures
by evidence the most firiking and fatisfadory.
WThen that great empire, which the superior
genius of Alexander had kept united and in
fubjeEtion, no longer felt his superintending
controul, it broke into pieces, and its various
provinces were seized by his principal officers,
and parcelled out among them. From am-
bition, emulation, and personal animosity, they
soon turned their arms against one another;
and as fcveral of the leaders were equally
eminent for political abilities and for military
skill, the contest was maintained long, and
carried on with frequent viciflitudes of fortune.
Amidst the various convulsions and revolutions
which there occasioned, it was found that the
measures of Alexander for the preservation of
his conquests had been concerted with such
sagacity, that, upon the final restoration of tran-
quillity, the Macedonian dominion continiedl

to

to be eflablifed in every part of Asia, and not s JE c T.
one province had ihaken off the yoke. Even I
India, the most remote of Alexander's con-
quests, quietly submitted to Pytho the son of
Agenor, and afterwards to Seleucus, who fuc-
ceffively obtained dominion over that part of
Asia. Porus and Taxiles, notwithstanding the
death of their benefacor, neither declined sub-
miniion to the authority of the Macedonians, nor
made any attempt to recover independence.

DURING the contests for power and fupe-

riority among the fucceflors of Alexander,
Seleucus, who, in every effort of enterprising
ambition, was inferior to none of them, having
rendered himself mailer of all the provinces
of the Persian empire comprehended under
the name of Upper Asia, confidered those
countries of India, which had been sub-
dued by Alexander, as belonging to that por-
tion of the Macedonian empire of which he
was now the sovereign. Seleucus, like all the
officers formed under Alexander, entertained
such high ideas of the advantages which might
be derived from a commercial intercourse with
India, as induced him to march into that coun-
try, partly with a view of eftablifling his own
authority there, and partly in order to curb
Sandracottus, who having lately acquired the

attack the Macedonians, whose Indian territo.,

our times. All we know of it is, that he ad-

ary of Alexander's progress in India ', and
would probably have proceeded much farther,
if he had not been confIrained to flop short
in his career in order to oppose Antigonus,
who was preparing to invade his dominions at
the hela of a formidable army. Before he
began his march towards the Euphrates, he
concluded a treaty with Sandracottus; in con.
sequence of which, that monarch quietly re-
tained the kingdom he had acquired. But
the powers and possessions of the Macedonians
seem to have remained unimpaired during
the reign of Seleucus, which terminated forty,
two years after the death of Alexander.

WITHr a view of cultivating a friendly inter.

course with Sandracottus, Selcucus made choice
of Megalthenes, an officer, who, fromn his hav-
ing accompanied Alexandcr in his expedition in.
to India, had sonic knowledgee of the

couintry,

country, and the manners of its inhabitants, and 9 E C T.
sent him as his ambassador to Palibothra . In I.
this famous capital of the Prafij, situated on
the banks of the Ganges, Megafthenes resided
feyeral years, and was, probably the firfi Euror
pean who ever beheld that mighty river, far
superior to any of the ancient continent in mag-
nitudex,, and no less diltinguifhed by the ser-
tility.of the countries through which it flows.
This journey. of Megafthenes to Palibothra made
Europeans acquainted with a large extentof coun-
try, of which they had not hitherto any know-
ledge;. for Alexander did not advance farther
towards the south-east, than. that part of the
river Hydraotes or Raufvee, where the modern
city of Lahore is situated, and Palibothra, the
site of which, as it is a capital position in the
geography of ancient India, I have investigated
with the utmost attention, appears to me the
fame with that of the modern city of Allahabad,
at the confluence of the two great rivers, Jum-
na and Ganges Y. As the road from Lahore to
Allahabad runs through sonic of the molt
cultivated and opulent provinces of India, the
more the country was explored the idea of
its value role higher. Accordingly, what Me-

s6 C T. bothra, and his residence there, made such an

impression upon his own mind, as induced him
L- A to publish an ample account of India, in order

to make his countrymen more thoroughly ac-
quainted with its importance. From his writ.
ings the ancients seem to have derived almost
all their knowledge of the interior fate of
India, and from comparing the three most
ample accounts of it, by Diodorus Siculus,
Strabo, and Arrian, they appear manifestly,
from their near resemblance, to be a transcript
of his words. But, unfortunately, Megafthenes
was so fond of the marvellous, that he mingled
with the truths which he related many extra.
vagant fictions; and to him may be traced
up the fabulous tales of men with ears so large
that they could wrap themselves up in them,
of others with a single eye, without mouths,
without noses, with long feet, and toes turned
backwards, of people only three spans in height,
of wild men with heads in the shape of a wedge,
of ants as large as foxes that dug up gold, and
many other things no less wonderful . The
extracts from his narrative which have been
transmitted to us by Strabo, Arrian, and other
writers, seem not to be entitled to credit, unless
when they are supported by internal evidence,
and confirmed by the tellimnony of other ancient

authors, or when they coincide with the expe- s E c T.
rience of modern times. His account, how- I
ever, of the dimensions and geography of India,
is curious and accurate. His description of
the power and opulence of the Prafij perfeEtly
resembles that which might have been given
of some of the greater fiates in the modern
Indoftan, before the-eftablifhment of the Ma-
homedan or European power in India, and is
consonant to- the accounts which Alexander had
received concerning that people. He was in-
formed, as has been already mentioned, that they
were prepared to oppose hinm on the banks
of the Ganges, with an army consisting of
twenty thousand cavalry, two hundred thou-
land infantry, and two thousand armed chariotsa;
and Megafthenes relates, that he had an audi-
ence of Sandracottus in a place where he was
encamped with an army of four hundred thou-
sand menb. The enormous dimensions which
he assigns to Palibothra, of no less than ten miles
in length, and two in breadth, and surrounded
by walls in which there were five hundred and fe.
venty towers, and fixty-four gates, would pro.
bably have been ranked by Europeans among
the wonders which he delighted to relate, if they

either fix with accuracy the time, or describe
the manner in which their poifeflions in India
were wrested from them. It is probable that
they were obliged to abandon that country
soon after the death of Seleucus .

BUT though the great monarchs of Syria

which had been subjed to their dominion,
the Greeks in a smaller kingdom, comnpofed
of some fragments of Alexander's empire, frill
maintained an intercourse with India, and even

the death of Alexander. Concerning the s E c T.
tranfaEtions of this kingdom, we- must reft fa- I.
tisfied with gleaning a few imperfect hints in
ancient authors. From them we learn that
its commerce with India was great; that the
conquests of the Badrian kings in that country
were more extensive than those of Alexander
himself, and particularly that they recovered
poffeflion of the diftri&t near the mouth of the
Indus, which he had subdued E. Each of the
fix princes who reigned in Bactria, carriedL
on military operations in India with such fuc-
cess, that they penetrated far into the interior
part of the country, and proud of the conquests
which they had made, as well as of the extensive
dominions over which they reigned, some of
them assumed the lofty title of Great King,
which distinguished the Persian monarchs in
the days of their highest splendour. But we
should not have known how long this kilg-
dom of Badria subsisted, or in what manner
it terminated, if M. de Guignes had not called
in the historians of China to supply the defects
of the Greek and Roman writers. By them
we are informed, that about one hundred and
twenty-fix years before the Christian sra, a

I' tive feats on the confines of China, and obliged

to move towards the weft by the pressure of a
more numerous body that rolled on behind
them, passed the Jaxartes, and pouring in upon
Badria, like an irrefiflible torrent, overwhelmed
that kingdom, and put an end to the dominion
of the Greeks ' there, after it had been eftablith-
ed near one hundred and thirty years .

FROM this time until the close of the fifteenth

century, when the Portuguese, by doubling the
Cape of Good Hope, opened a new communi-
cation with the East, and carried their victorious
arms into every part of India, no European
power acquired territory, or etfablifhed its do-
minion there. During this long period, of more
than sixteen hundred years, all schemes of con-
quelt in India seem to have been totally relin-
quifhed, and nothing more was aimed at by any
nation, than to secure an intercourse of trade
with that opulent country.

IT was in Egypt that the feat of this inter-

course was eflablifhed; and it is not without

gularly

gularly the commerce with the East came to s E C T.
be carried on by that channel, in which the fa.- I
gacity of Alexander destined it to flow. Ptolemy, '
the son of Lagus, as soon as he took possession
of Egypt, established the feat of government in
Alexandria. By some exertions of authority,
and many acs of liberality, but chiefly by the
fame of his mild and equal administration, he
drew such a number of inhabitants to this fa-
vourite residence, that it soon became a popu-
lous and wealthy city. As Ptolemy deserved
and had pofleffed the confidence of Alexander
more perfectly than any of his officers, he knew
well that his chief objeEt in founding Alexandria
was to secure the advantages arising from the
trade with India. A long and prosperous reign
was favourable to the prosecution of that object,
and though ancient authors have not enabled us
to trace the steps which the first Ptolemy took
for this purpose, we have a striking evidence of
his extraordinary attention to naval affairs, in
his ere&ing a light-house on the island of Pharos,
at the mouth of the harbour of Alexandria h, a
work of such magnificence as to be reckoned
one of the seven wonders of the world. With
refped to the commercial arrangements of his
son Ptolemy Philadelphus, we have more per-
set information. In order to bring the trade

s A c T. with India, (which began to revive at Tyre, its

A. antient station ',) to centre in Alexandria, he
C ^ flet about forming a canal, an hundred cubits in

breadth, and thirty cubits in depth, between
Arfinoe on the Red Sea, not far from the
situation of the modern Suez, and the Pelufiac
or eastern branch of the Nile, by means of
which the productions of India might have been
conveyed to that capital wholly by water. But
either on account of tome danger apprehended
from completing it, that work was never finish-
ed; or from the flow and dangerous navigation
towards the northern extremity of the Red Sea,
this canal was found to be of so little use, that
in order to facilitate the communication with
India, he built a city on the weft coast of that
sea, almost under the Tropic, to which he gave
the name of Berenicek. This new city soon
became the flaple of the trade with India J.
From Berenice the goods were transported by
land to Coptos, a city three miles distant from
the Nile, but which had a communication with
that river by a navigable canal, of which there
are till fonme remains m, and thence carried down

Berenice and Coptos was, according to Pliny, I.
two hundred and fifty-eight Roman miles, and '-
the road lay through the defart of Thebais,
almost entirely destitute of water. But the at-
tention of a powerful monarch made provision
for supplying this want, by searching for springs,
and Wherever these were found he built inns, or
more probably in the eastern style caravanferas,
for the accommodation of merchants ". In this
channel the intercourse between the East and
Weft continued to be carried on during two

This, according to M. de Montefquieuo, was
the kingdom of Sigertis, on the sea-coast ad-
jacent to the mouth of the Indus, conquered by
the Greek monarchs of Baftria; according to
Major Rennell P, it was a port on the northern
part of the Malabar coast. Ancient authors
have not conveyed such information as will
enable us to pronounce with certainty, which of
these two opposite opinions is best founded.
Nor can we point out with accuracy, what were
the other ports in India which the merchants
from Berenice frequented, when that trade
was first opened. As they failed in vefiels of
small burden, which crept timidly along the
coast, it is probable that their voyages
were circumscribed within very narrow li.
mits, and that under the Ptolemies no con,
fiderable progress was made in the discovery of
India q

enjoyed, it derived that extraordinary degree of

cuous. In modern times, acquainted with the s z c T.
vigilant and enterprizing acivity of commercial z-
rivalfhip, there is hardly any circumstance in T"
ancient story which appears more surprising,
than that the sovereigns of Egypt /hould have
been permitted to engross this lucrative trade
without competition, or any attempt to wrest it
out of their hands; especially as the powerful
monarchs of Syria might, from the Persian
Gulf, have carried on an intercourse with the
fame parts of India, by a shorter and safer course
of navigation. Different considerations seem to
have induced them so tamely to relinquish all
the obvious advantages of this commerce. The
kings of Egypt, by their attention to maritime
affairs, had formed a powerful fleet, which gave
them such decided command of the sea, that
they could have crushed with ease any rival in
trade. No commercial intercourse seems ever
to have been carried on by sea between Persia
and India. The Persians had such an infupe-
rable aversion to that element, or were so much
afraid of foreign invasion, that their monarchs
(as I have already observed) obflru(ted the na-
vigation of the great rivers, which gave access
to the interior parts of the country, by artificial
works. As their fubjets, however, were no
left dcfirous than the people around them tp
)poUl'fs the valuable productions and elegant

rj(. illanu-

, E T. manufaCtures of India, these were conveyed to

I. all the parts of their extensive dominions by
CY"!r* land-carriage. The commodities deflined for

the supply of the northern provinces, were
transported on camels from the banks of
the Indus to those of the Oxus, down the
tream of which they were carried to the
Caspian sea, and distributed, partly by land-
carriage, and partly by navigable rivers, through
the different countries, bounded on one hand by
the Caspian, and on the other by the Euxine
sea'. The commodities of India intended for
the southern and interior provinces, proceeded
by land front the Caspian gates to some of the
great rivers, by which they were circulated
through every part .qs the country. This was
the ancient mode. of 'intercourse with India,
while the Persian jempire was governed by itc
native princes; and it has been observed in
every age, that when any branch of commerce
has got into a certain channel, although it may
be neither the most proper nor the most
commodious one, it requires long titme, and
considerable cfforts, to give it a different di-
redion '.

To

To all these reasons for suffering the monarchs s E C T.

of Egypt to continue in the undiflurbed posses- I.
sion of the trade with India by sea, another may
be added. Many of the ancients, by an error
in geography extremely unaccountable, and in
which they persisted, notwithfanding repeated
opportunities of obtaining more accurate in-
formation, believed the Caspian sea to be a
branch of the great Northern Ocean, and the
kings of Syria might hope by that means to
open a communication with Europe, and to
circulate through it the valuable productions of
the East, without intruding into those seas, the
navigation of which the Egyptian monarchs
seemed to confider as their exclusive right.
This idea had been early formed by the Greeks,
when they became matters of Asia. Seleucus
Nicator, the first and molt sagacious of the Sy-
rian kings, at the time when he was assassinated,
entertained thoughts of forming a juncion be-
tween the Caspian and Euxine leas by a canal',
and if this could have been effeted, his sub-
jecds, betides the extension of their trade in
Europe, might have supplied all the countries
in the North of Alia, on the coast of the
Euxine sea, as well as many of those which
itretch eastward from the Caspian, with the
]ro(lucions of India. As those countries,

S E C T. though now thinly inhabited by a miserable

race of men, destitute of industry and of wealth,
r- ,were in ancient times extremely populous, and

filled with great and opulent cities, this must
have been confidered as a branch of commerce
of such magnitude and value, as to render the
securing of it an objet worthy the attention of
the most powerful monarch.

BUT while the monarchs of Egypt and Syria

laboured with emulation and ardour to secure
to their fubjets all the advantages of the In.
dian trade, a power arose in the Weft which
proved fatal to both. The Romans, by the
vigour of their military inititutions, and the
wisdom of their political condud, having ren.
dered themselves masters of all Italy and Sicily,
soon overturned the rival republic of Carthage,

dom remaining of those established by the fuc.
ceffors of Alexander the Great. After a series
of events, which belong not to the fubjeEt of
this Disquisition, Egypt was annexed to the
Roman empire, and reduced into the form of a
Roman province by Augustus, Aware of its
A. . 3. great importance, he, with that provident saga-

city which diltinguifhes his character, not only

reserved

reserved it as one of the provinces fubje& im- s E c T.
mediately to Imperial authority, but by various i.
precautions, well, known to every scholar, pro-
vided for its security. This extraordinary soli-
citude seems to have proceeded not only from
confidering Egypt :as one of the chief granaries
on which the capital depended for fubfifence,
but as the feat of that lucrative commerce which
had enabled its ancient monarchs to amass such
enormous wealth, as excited the admiration and
envy of other princes, and produced, when
brought into the treasury of the empire, a confi.
derable alteration, both in the value of property,
and the state of manners, in Rome itself.

of the Roman Dominion in Egypt, to the Con-

s E c T. UPON the conqueRl of Egypt by the Romans,

II. and the reduction of that kingdom to a
.A.. province of their empire, the trade with India

continued to be carried on in the fame mode,
under their powerful protection: Rome, en-
riched with the spoils and the tribute of
almofR all the known world, had acquired a
taste for luxuries of every kind. Among
people of this description, the produtions of
India have always been held in the highest
estimation. The capital of the greatefi em-

pire

pire ever eltablified in Europe, filled with s E c Ta
citizens, who had now no occupation but to oi.
enjoy and diflipate the wealth accumulated
by their ancestors, demanded every thing
elegant, .rare, or costly, which that remote
region could furnish, in order to support
its pomp, or heighten its pleasures. To
supply this demand, new and extraordinary
efforts became requisite, and the commerce with
India increased to a degree, which (as I have
observed in another placea) will appear astonish-
ing even to the present age, in which that
branch of trade has been extended far beyond
the practice or conception of any former
period.

BESIDES the-Indian commodities imported

into the capital of the empire from Egypt,
rhe Romans received an additional supply of
them by another mode of conveyance. From
the earliest tifes, there seems to have been
iome communication between Mesopotamia,
and other provinces on the banks of the Eu-
phratcs, and thole parts of Syria and Paleltine,
which lay near the Mediterranean. The mi-
gration of Abram from Ur, of the Chaldees
from Sichem in the land of Canaan, is an inltance
of thisb. The journey through the defart,

the intercourse increased, the poffeflion of
this station became an objet of so much
importance, that Solomon) when he turned
his attention towards the extension of commerce
among his fubjets, built a fenced city there'.
Its Syrian name of Tadnor in the wilderness,
and its Greek one of Palmyra, ate both defcrip.
tive of its situation in a spot adorned with palm-
trees. This is not only plentifully supplied with
water, but surrounded by a portion of fertile
land, which (though of no great extent) renders
it a delightful habitation in the midst of barren
sands and an inhospitable defart. Its happy
position, at the distance of eighty-five miles
from the river Euphrates, and about one hun-
dred and seventeen miles from the nearest
coast of the Mediterranean , induced its in-
habitants to enter with ardour into the trade
of conveying commodities from one of these

age, did not retain his wonted accuracy. From information
vnoinmunicated by lMajor Renncll, I have fubltitutcd the true

to the other. As the most valuable productions E C r.
of India, brought up the Euphrates from the Per- ii.
fian Gulf, are of such small bulk as to bear
the expence of a long land-carriage, this trade
soon became so considerable that .the opulence
and power of Palmyra increased rapidly. Its go-
vernment was of the form which is belt suited
to the genius of a commercial city, republican;
and from the peculiar advantages of its situation,
as well as the spirit of its inhabitants, it long
maintained its independence, though surrounded
by powerful and ambitious neighbours. Under
the Syrian monarchs descended from Seleucus
it attained to its highest degree of splendour
and wealth, one great source of which seems. to
have been the supplying their fubjets with
Indian commodities. When Syria submitted
to the irrefiftiblc arms of Rome, Palmyra con.
tinued upwards of .two centuries a free .fate,
and its :friendship was courted with emulation
and solicitude by the Romans, and their rivals
for empire, the Parthians. That it traded with
both, and particularly that from it Ronme as
well as other parts of the empire received the
productions of India, we learn from Appian,
an author of good credit ". But in tracing thb

channels of note in which it was carried on,
if a singular discovery, for which we are in.
debted to the liberal curiosity and enterprising
spirit of our own countrymen, did not confirm
and illuifrate what he relates. Toiards the
close of the last century, some gentlemen of
the English faftory at Aleppo, incited by what
they heard in the East concerning the won-
derful ruins of Palmyra, ventured, notwith-
standing the fatigue and danger of a journey
through the defart, to visit them. To their
astonishment they beheld a fertile spot of some
miles in extent arising like an island out
of a vast plain of sand, covered with the re-
mains of temples, porticoes, aqueduEs, and
other public works, which, in magnificence
and splendour, and some of them in elegance,
were not unworthy of'Athens or of Rome in
their molt prosperous slate. Allured by their
description of them, about sixty years thereafter,
a party of more enlightened travellers, having
reviewed the ruins of Palmyra with greater atten-
tion and more scientific skill, declared that what
they beheld there exceeded the most exalted
ideas which they had formed concerning its.

dcfolated the earth, and the freaks of tyrants
who have rendered nations unhappy, are re-
corded with minute and often difgufling ac-
curacy, while the.difcovery of useful arts,, and
the progress of the most beneficial branches of
commerce, are passed over in silence, and sus-
sered to flnk into oblivion.

AFTERr the conquest of Parlyra by Autelian,

trade never revived there. At present a few
mifefable huts, of beggarly Arabs are fcattcrle
in the courts of jts stately tcmples, or deform its

elegant

S C T. elegant porticoes ; and exhibit an humiliating

contrast to its ancient magnificence.

BUT while the merchants of Egypt and Syria

exerted their activity in order to supply the
increasing demands of Rome for Indian com-
modities, and vied with each other in their
efforts, the eagerness of gain (as Pliny observes)
brought India itself nearer to the reft of the
world. In the course of their voyages to that
country, the Greek and Egyptian pilots could
not fail to observe the regular fhiftihg of the
periodical winds or monsoons, and how steadily
they continued to blow duriig one part of
the year from the East, and during the other
from the Weft. Encouraged by attending
to this circumstance, Hippalus, the commander
of a fiip engaged in the Indian trade, ventured,
about fourscore years after Egypt was annexed
lo the Roman empire, to relinquish the flow
and circuitous course which I have described,
;and itretching boldly from the mouth of the
Arabian Gulf across the ocean, was carried by
the wcftern monfoop to Mufiris, a harbour in
that part of India, now known by the name of
the Malabar coast.

'ltis route to India was held to be a dif-
ovcry of such importance, that in order to
lerpctuate the memory of the inventor, the

12 name

name of Hippalus was given to the wind s E c T.
which enabled him to perform the voyageg It.
As this was one of the greatest efforts of na-
vigation in the ancient world, and opened the
belt communication by sea between the East
and Wefl that was known for fourteen hundred
years, it merits a particular description. For-
tunately Pliny has enabled us to give it with
a degree of accuracy, which can seldom be
attained in tracing the naval or commercial
operations of the ancients. From Alexandria
(he observes) to Juliopolis is two miles; there
the cargo destined for India is embarked on
the Nile, and is carried to Coptos, which is
distant three hundred and three miles, and
the voyage is usually accomplished in twelve
days. From -Coptos goods are conveyed by
land carriage to Berenice on the Arabian Gulf,
halting at different tfations regulated according
to the conveniency of watering. The distance
between there cities is two hundred and
fifty-eight miles. On account of the heat,
the caravan travels only during the night, and
the journey is finished on the twelfth day.
From Berenice, ships take their departure
about midiummer, and in thirty days reach
Occlis (Gella) at the mouth of the Arabian

wind, and when they enter the Arabian Gulf
meet with' a 'south or; fouth-we(t wind,: and
thus complete the voyage in less than a yearh.

THE account whigch Pliny gives of i\fufiris,

and of Barace, another harbour not far dilant,
which was ilkexife frequented by the, flhips
from Berenice, as being both so incommodious for
trade on account of the shallowness of the ports,
that it became necessary to discharge and take
in the cargoes in small boats, does not enable
us to fix their position with perfect accuracy.
This description applies to many ports on' the
Malabar coait, but from two circumitances
mentioned by him; one, that they are not far
distant from Cottonara, the country which pro-
duces pepper in great abundance; and the
other, that in failing towards them the course
lay near Nitrias, the flation of the pirates; I
adopt the opinion of Major Rennell, that they
were situated fomcwhcrc between Goa and

of the commerce which the ancients, particu-

in request, which they imported from it. But
as the operations of commerce, and the mode

hardly enter into any detail concerning a subjeC
of such subordinate importance in their political
fyflem, and it is moflly from brief hints, de-
tached fats, and incidental observations, that
we can gather information concerning it kL

IN every age, it has been a commerce of

luxury, rather than of necefliry, which has

of

s E C T. of simple manners, nor are such nations poffefi-

n. ed of wealth sufficient to purchase them. But

at the time the Romans became mailers of the
Indian trade, they were not only (as has already
been observed) in that itage of society when
men are eager to obtain every thing that can
reader the enjoyment of life more exquisite,
or add to its splendour, but they had acquired
all the fantastic taftes formed by the caprice
and extravagance of wealth. They were of
consequence highly delighted with those new ob-
jeEs of gratification with which India supplied
them in such abundance. The productions of
that country, natural as well as artificial, seem
to have been much the fame in that age as
in the prefcnt. But the taste of the Romans
in luxury differed in many reFpets from that
of modern times, and of course their demands
from India differed considerably from ours.

IN order to convey an idea of their demands

as complete as possible, I llall in the first place
make tome observations on the three great
articles of general importation from India.
i. Spices and aromatics. 2. Precious stones
and pearls. 3. Silk. And then I shall give
tome account (as far as I can venture to do
it from authentic information) of the assortment
of cargoes, both outward and homeward bound,

for

for the vessels fitted out at Berenice to different s E C T.
ports of India. s.

I. SPICES and aromatics. From the mode of

religious worflip in the heathen world; from
the incredible number of their deities, and of
the temples consecrated to them; the con-
fumption of frankincense and other aromatics
which were used in every sacred function, muff
have been very great. But the vanity of men
occasioned a greater consumption of these
fragrant substances, than their piety. It was
the custom of the Romans to burn the bodies
of their dead, and they deemed it a display of
magnificence, to cover not only the body but
the funeral pile on which it was laid, with the
mofl costly spices. At the funeral of Sylla,
two hundred and ten burdens of spices were
firewed upon the pile. Nero is reported to
have burnt a quantity of cinnamon and cassia
at the funeral of Pappaca, greater than the
countries from which it was imported produced
in one year. We consume in heaps there pre-
cious substances with the carcasses of the dead
(fays Pliny): We offer them to the Gods only
in grains m. It was not from India, I am aware,
but from Arabia, that aromatics were first im-
ported into Europe; and tome of them, par-
licularly fiankincenfe, werc productions of that

F country,.

s E C T. country. But the Arabians were accustomed,

II. together with spices of native growth, to fur-

nihi foreign merchants with others of higher
value, which they brought from India, and
the regions beyond it. The commercial inter-
course of the Arabians with the Eastern parts
of Asia, was not only early, but considerable.
By means of their trading caravans, they con.
veyed into their own country all the valuable
produ&ions of the East, among which, spices
held a chief place. In every ancient account
of Indian commodities, spices and aroma-
tics of various kinds form a principal art
ticle ". Some authors aflert that the greater
part of those purchased in Arabia were not
the growth of that country, but brought from
India °. That this assertion was well-founded,
appears from what has been observed in mo-
dern times. The frankincense of Arabia,
though reckoned the peculiar and most pre,
cious producion of the country, is much in-
ferior in quality to that imported into it from
the East; and it is chiefly with the latter, that
the Arabians at present supply the extensive
demands of various provinces of Asia for this
commlodity . It is upon good authority, then,

that

that I have mentioned the importation of fpiccs s. E c T.
as one of the most confidetable branches of IL
ancient commerce with India. In the Auguf -
tan age, an entire fireet in Rome teems to have
been occupied by those who fold frankincense,
pepper, and other aromatics Y.

II. PRECIOUS scones, together with which

pearls may be classed, seem to be the article
next in value imported by the Romans fronm
the East. As these have no pretension to be
of any real use, their value arises entirely from
their beauty and their rarity, and even when
eltimated most moderately is always high.
But among nations far advanced in luxury,
when they are deemed not only ornaments but
marks of distinction, the vain and the opulent
vie so eagerly with one another for the pof-
feTion of them, that they rife in price to an
exorbitant and almost incredible height. Dia-
monds, though the art of cutting them was
imperfecly known to the ancients, held an high
place in estimation among them as well as
among us. The comparative value of other
precious stones varied according to the diver-
fity of taftes and the caprice of fashion. The
immense number of them mentioned by Pliny,

Hor. lib. ii. epiit. I.

F 2 and

s E C T. and the laborious care with which he describes

Ix. and arranges them r, will astonish, I should sup-
^^*' ppofe, the most skilful lapidary or jeweller of

modern times, and thews the high request in
which they were held by the Romans.

BUT among all the articles of luxury, the

Romans seem to have given the preference to
pearls . Persons of every rank purchased them
with eagerness; they were worn on every part
of dress; and there is such a difference, both
in size and in value, among pearls, that while
such as were large and of superior lustre adorned
the wealthy and the great, finaller ones and
of inferior quality gratified the vanity of per-
tbns in more humble flations of life. Julius
Cxfar presented Servilia, the mother of Brutus,
with a pearl, for which he paid forty-eight
thousand four hundred and fifty-feven pounds.
The famous pearl ear-rings of Cleopatra were
in value one hundred and fixty-one thousand
four hundred and fifty-eight poundst. Pre-
cious ltones, it is true, as well as pearls, were
found not only in India, but in many different
countries, and all were rantacked in order to
gratify the pride of Rome. India, however,

furniflhcl

furnilhed the chief part, and its productions s c T,
were allowed to be moil abundant, diversified, II-
and valuable.

III. ANOTHER production of India in great

demand at Rome, was silk; and when we re-
collet the variety of elegant fabrics into which
it may be formed, and how much there have
added to the splendour of dress and furniture, we
cannot wonder at its being held in such eftima-
tion by a luxurious people. The price it bore
was exorbitant; but it was deemed a dress too
expensive and too delicate for men ", and was ap-
propriated wholly to women of eminent rank
and opulence. This, however, did not render
the demand for it less eager, especially after the
example of the dissolute Elagabalus introduced
the use of it among the other sex, and accuf-
tomed men to the disgrace (as the severity of
ancient ideas accounted it) of wearing this es-
feminate garb. Two circumltances concerning
the traffic of silk among the Romans merit ob-
servation. Contrary to what usually takes place
in the operations of trade, the more general
aile of that commodity teems not to have in,
creased the quantity imported, in such propor-
tion as to answer the growing demand for it,

U Tacit. Annal. lib. ii. c. 33.

' 3 and

E C T. and the price of silk was not reduced during
1I. the course of two hundred and fifty years from
1nr -the time of its being first known in Rome.

In the reign of Aurelian, it flill continued to be
valued at its weight in gold. This, it is pro-
bable, was owing to the mode in which that
commodity was procured by the merchants of
Alexandria. They had no direc intercourse
with China, the only country in which the silk.
worm was then reared, and its labour rendered
an article of commerce. All the silk which
they purchased in the different ports of India
that they frequented, was brought thither
in ships of the country; and either from some
defet of skill in managing the silk-worm,
the produce of its ingenious industry among
the Chinese was scanty, or the intermediate
dealers found greater advantage in furnishing
the market of Alexandria with a frnall quantity
at an high price, than to lower its value by
increasing the quantity. The other circum-
france which I had in view is more extraor.
dinary, and affords a striking proof of the im-
perfec communication of the ancients with
remote nations, and of the slender knowledge
which they had of their natural productions
or arts. Much as the manufactures of lilk were
;tlniirccl, and often as silk is mentioncd by the
.;-'ck and Roman authors, they had not, for

several

several centuries after the use of it became com- s E c r.
mon, any certain knowledge either of the 1.
countries to which they were indebted for
this favourite article of elegance, or of the man-
ner in which it Was produced. By some, silk
was supposed to be a fine down adhering to
the leaves of certain trees or flowers ; others
imagined it to be a delicate species of wool or
cotton; and even those who had learned that it
was the work of an infe&, fhetv, by their defcrip-
tiohs, that they had no diftini idea of the man-
ner in which it was formed . It was ih confe-
quence of an event that happened in the flth
century of the Christian ~era, of which I. fial
hereafter take notice; that the real nature of silk
became known in Europe.

THa other commodities usually imported from

India, will be mentioned in the account, which
I now proceed to give, of the cargoes sent out
and brought home in the ships employed in the
trade with that country; For this re are in-
debted to the Circumnavigation of the Ery-
thrsean Sea, ascribed to Arrian, a curious though
short treatise, less known than it deserves to
be, and which enters into some details con-
scrning commerce, to which there is nothing

4F similar

S E c T. similar in any ancient writer. The first place

I'. in India, in which the ships from Egypt, while
'"3 ^ they followed the ancient course of navigation,

were accustomed to trade, was Patala in the
river Indus. They imported into it woollen
cloth of a flight fabric, linen in chequer Work,
some precious stones, and some aromatics un-
known in India, coral, storax, glass vessels of
different kinds, some wrought silver, money,
and wine. In return for there, they received
spices of various kinds, sapphires, and other
gems, silk fluffs, silk thread, cotton clothsr,
and black pepper. But a far more considerable
emporium on the fame. coast was Barygaza,
and on that account the'author, whom I follow
here, describes its situation, and the mode of
approaching it, with great minuteness and ac-
curacy. Its situation corresponds entirely with
that of Baroach, on the.great river Nerbuddah,
down the fiream of which, or.by land-carriage,
from.the great city of Tagara across high moun-
tains , all the produtions of the interior coun-
try .were. conveyed to it.. The articles of im-
portation and exportation in this great mart
were extensive and various. Betides these al-
ready .inntioned, .our author enumerates among
the.former, Italian, Greek, and Arabian wines,

brass,

brass, tin, lead, girdles or fashes of curious s E C T.
texture, melilot, white glass, red arsenic, black II.
lead, gold and silver coin. Among the exports
he mentions the onyx, and other gems, ivory,
myrrh, various fabrics of cotton, both plain
and ornamented with flowers, and long pepper .
At Mufiris, the next emporium of note on that
coast, the articles imported were much the fame
as at Barygaza; but as it lay nearer to the
eastern parts of India, and seems to have had
much communication with them, the commo-
dities exported from it were more numerous and
more valuable. He specifies particularly pearls
in great abundance and of extraordinary beauty,
a variety of silk fluffs, rich perfumes, tortoise-
ihell, different kinds of transparent gems, efpe-
cially diamonds, and pepper in large quantities,
and of the best quality .

THE juflnefs of the account given by this

aluthor of the articles imported from India, is
confirmed by a Roman law, in which the
Indian commodities subjea to the payment of
duties are enumerated'. By comparing these
two accounts, we may form an idea tolerably

exaad,

S E C T. exam, of the nature and extent of the trade with

II. India in ancient times.

As the tlate of society and manners among

the natives of Iidia, in the earliest period in
which they are known, nearly refemnbled what
we observe among their descendants in the pre-
sent age; their wants and demands were, of
course, much the fame. The ingenuity of their
own artists were so able to supply these, that
they stood little in need of foreign manufactures
or productions, except some of the useful metals,
which their own country did not furnish in sus-
ficient quantity; and then, as now, it was motly
with gold and silver that the luxuries of the
East were purchased. In two particulars, how-
ever, our importations from India differ greatly
from those of the ancients. The dress, both
of the Greeks and Romans, was almost entirely
woollen, which, by their frequent use of the
warm bath, was rendered abundantly com-
sortable. Their consumption of linen and cot-
ton cloths was much inferior to that of modem
times, when these are worn by persons in every
rank of life. Accordingly, a great branch of
modlern importation from that part of India
'with which the ancients were acquainted, is in
piL'(EgoodJ ; conprelhending, under that mer-
cantile term, thle immense variety of fabrics,

which

vwhich Indian ingenuity has formed of cotton. s E c T,
But, as far as I have observed, we have no au- HI.
thority that will justify us in Rtating the ancient
importation of these to be in any degree con-
fiderable.

IN modern times, though it continues fill

to be chiefly a commerce of luxury that is car-
tied on with India, yet, together with the ar-
ticles that minilter to it, we import, to a con-
fiderable extent, various commodities, which
are to be confidered merely as the materials of
our domestic manufa&ures. Such are, the cot-
ton-wool of Indoftan, the silk of China, and
the salt.petre of Bengal. But, in the accounts
of ancient importations from India, raw silk and
iilk-thread excepted, I find nothing mentioned
that could serve as the materials of any home-
manufaEture. The navigation of the ancients
never having extended to China, the quantity
of unwrought silk with which they were sup-
plied, by means of the Indian traders, appears
to have been so scanty, that the manufauture
of it could not make an addition of any moment
to ticir domeflic indulrty.

ASirE.R this fuccinc account of the commerce

carried on by the ancients in India, I proceed
to inquire what knowledge they had of the
countries byvond the ports of Mufiris and Barace,

the

s E C r. the utmost boundary towards the East to which

11. I have hitheito traced their progress. The
bw^^ Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ery-

threan Sea, whose accuracy of description jus-
tifies the confidence with which I have followed
him for otme time, seems to have been little
acquainted with that part of the coast which
firetches from Barace towards the south. He
mentions, indeed, cursorily, two or three dif-
ferent ports, but gives no intimation that any of
them were fraples of the commerce with Egypt.
He hastens to Comar, or Cape Comorin, the
southernmost point of the Indian peninsula; and
his description of it is so accurate, and so
conformable to its real slate, as thews his in-
formation concerning it to have been perfecly
authentic '. Near to this he places the pearl.
fishery of Colchos, the modern Kilkare, un-
doubtedly the lame with that now carried on
by the Dutch il the itreight which separates
the island of Ceylon from the continent; as
adjacent to this he mentions three different
ports, which appear to have been situated on
Ihe call ficle of the peninsula now known by
the name of the Coroimandcl coast. He de-
cTribcs thelc as crniioria, or stations of trade ;
but from an attentive consideration of tomic cir-

Iripl p. p33. D'Ax\illc Ant. de 1'I c,

cumftances

cumftances in his account of them, I think it s E c T.
probable that the (hips from Berenice did not II
fail to any of these ports, though they were
supplied, as he informs us, with the commodities
brought from Egypt, as well as with the pro-
duetions of the opposite coast of the peninsula;
but these seem to have been imported in country
hips '. It was likewise in vessels of their own,
varying in form and burden, and diftinguilhed
by different names, some of which he mentions,
that they traded with the Golden Cherfonefus,
or kingdom of Malacca, and the countries near
the Ganges. Not far from the mouth of that
river he places an island, which he describes as
situated under the riing fun, and as the last
region in the East that was inhabited g. Of all
these parts of India, the Author of the Circum-
navigation appears to have had very slender
knowledge, as is manifefr, not only from what
he mentions concerning this imaginary island,
and from his not attempting to describe them,
but fiom his relating, with the credulity and
love of the marvellous, which always accom-
pany and charafterife ignorance, that these re-
mote regions were peopled with cannibals, and
men of uncouth and monstrous forms .

I ]IAV.N

S E C T. I HAVE been induced to bestow this attention)

II. in tracing the course delineated in the Circum-
"3 -navigation of the Erythrwan Sea, because the

Author of it is the first ancient writer to whom
\ve are indebted for any knowledge of the
eartern coast of the great peninsula of India, or
of the countries which lie beyond it. To Strabo,
who composed his great work on geography
in the reign of Augultus, India, particularly the
most eastern parts of it, was little known. He
begins his description of it with requefling the
indulgence of his readers, on account of the
scanty information he could obtain with refped
to a country so remote, which Europeans had
seldom visited, and many of them transiently
only, in the functions of military service. He
observes, that even commerce had contributed
little towards an accurate invefligation of the
country, as few of the merchants from Egypt
and the Arabian Gulf had ever failed as far
as the Ganges ; and from men so illiterate,
intelligence that merited a full degree of con-
fidence could scarcely be expe&ed. His de-
fcriprions of India, particularly its interior pro.
vinccs, are borrowed almost entirely from the
Meminoirs of Alexander's Officers, with some
fliidcr additil o

is from more recent accounts,

anid tlicfhe l few in number, and fometines so
inalccuratc, as to furlifli a firiking proof of the

4 finall

inall progress which the ancients had made, s E c T.
lomn the time of Alexander, in exploring that I
country. When an author, possessed of such
discernment and induflry as Strabo, who visited
in person several diitant regions, that he might
be able to describe them with greater accuracy,
relates, that the Ganges enters the ocean by one
mouth i, we are warranted in concluding,
that in his time there was either no direc na-
vigation carried on to that great river, by the
traders from the Arabian Gulf, or that this
voyage was undertaken so seldom, that fci-
ence had not then derived much information
from it.

THE next author, in order of time, from

whom we receive any account of India, is the
elder Pliny, who flourished about fifty years
later than Strabo. As in the fhiort description
of India, given in his Natural History, he follows
the fame guides with Strabo, and seems to have
had no knowledge of the interior country, but
what he derived from the Memoirs of the Of-
ficers who served under Alexander and his im-
mediate fucccffors, it is unnecelfary to examine
his description minutely. I-e has added, how-
ever, two valuable articles, for which he was
indebted to more recent discoveries. The one

Strabo, lib. xv. r0aI. C.

is

s E C T. is the account of the new course of navigation

rr. from the Arabian Gulf to the coast of Malabar,

the nature and importance of which I have
already explained. The other is a description
of the island of Taprobana, which I {hall con-
idler particularly, after inquiring into what
Ptoleniv has contributed towards our knowledge
of the ancient state of the Indian continent.

TIOUGHc Ptolemy, who published his works

about fourlcore years after Pliny, seems to have
been diftinguilhed for his persevering induflry,
and talent for arrangement, rather than for an
inventive genius; geography has been more in-
debted to him for its improvement, than to any
other philosopher. Fortunately for that science,
in forming his general system of geography, he
adopted the ideas, and imitated the practice of
Ilipparchus, who lived near four hundred years
before his time. That gre:at philosopher was
thl firfl who attempted to make a catalogue of
the flars. In order to ascertain their position
in the licavens with accuracy, he measured their
diflance from certain circles of the sphere, com-
puting it by degrees, either fromi cast to weft,
or from north to south. The former was de-
nominated the longitude of the tsar, the latter
its latitude. h'lis mode lie found to be of such
utility in hi; altrolnoiical refc:archcs, that he
applied it with no less happy ccctt to geogra-

phy ;

phy; and it is a circumstance worthy of notice, SE C r.
that it was by observing and describing the u1
heavens, men were first taught to measure and
delineate the earth with exaanefs. This me-
thod of fixing the position of places, invented
by Hipparchus, though known to the geogra.
phers between his time and that of Ptolemy,
and mentioned both by Strabo k and by Pliny',
was not employed by any of them. Of this
negle& the most probable account seems to
be, that, as none of them were astronomers,
they did not fully comprehend all the advan-
tages geography might derive from this inven-
tion". These Ptolemy, who had devoted a
long life to the improvement of astronomy,
theoretical as well as practical, perfelcly dif-
cerned, and, as in both Hipparchus was his
guide, he, in his famous treatise on geogra'
phy, described the different parts of the earth
according to their longitude and latitude. Geo-
graphy was thus established upon its proper prin-
ciples, and intimately conne&ted with aftronomi.
cal observation and mathematical science. This
wsork of Ptolemy soon rote high in eftitation
among the ancients". During the middle ages,
both in Arabia and in Europe, the decisions of

S E C T. Ptolemy, in every thing relative to geography,

II- were submitted to with an assent as implicit,

as was yielded to those of Aristotle in all other
departments of science. On the revival of a
more liberal spirit of inquiry in the sixteenth
century, the merit of Ptolemy's improvements
in geography swas examined and recognized;
that scientific language which he first rendered
general, continues to be used, and the position
of places is 1till ascertained in the fame diftint
and compendious manner, by specifying their
longitude and latitude.

NOT satisfied with adopting the general prin-

ciples of Hipparchus, Ptolemy emulated him
in the application of them; and, as that philo-
fopher had arranged all the constellations, he
ventured upon what was no less arduous, to
survey all the regions of the earth which were
then known, and with minute and bold de-
cifion he fixed the longitude and latitude of the
most remarkable places in each of them. All
his determinations, however, are not to be con-
fidered as the result of actual observation, nor
did Ptolemy publifl them as such. Atrono-
mical science mas confined, at that time, to
a few countries. A considerable part of the
globe was little visited, and imperfedly de-
icrihed. The position of a finall number of

places

places only had been fixed with any degree of s E c T.
accuracy. Ptolemy was therefore obliged to -.
consult the itineraries and surveys of the Roman '"
Empire, which the political wisdom of that
great state had completed with immense labour
:;nd expence°. Beyond the precinas of the
empire, he had nothing on which he could rely,
but the journals and reports of travellers. Upon
these all his conclusions were founded; and as
he resided in Alexandria at a time when the
trade ftom that city'to India was carried on to
its utmost extent, this situation might have
been expected to afford him the means of pro-
curing ample information concerning it. But
either from the imperfet manner in which that
country was explored in his time, or from his
placing too much confidence in the reports of
persons who had visited it with little attention
or discernment P, his general delineation of the
form of the Indian continent is the most er-
roneous that has been transmitted to us from
antiquity. By an artonifhing mistake, he has
made the peninsula of India stretch fiom the
Sinus Barygazenus, or Gulf of Cambay, from
\wei to east, instead of extending, according
to its real direction, from north to foutli".

S E C T. This error will appear the more unaccountable,

t.r when we recollea that Megafthenes had pub.
t-^-- lifhed a measurement of the Indian peninsula,

which approaches near to its true dimensions;
and that this had been adopted, with some va-
riations, by Eratosthenes, Strabo, Diodorus
Siculus, and Pliny, who wrote prior to the age
of Ptolemyr.

ALTHOUGH Ptolemy was led to form such

an erroneous opinion concerning the general
diineniions of the Indian continent, his in-
formation with relpeEt to the country in detail,
and the situation of particular places, was more
accurate; and he is the firtf author possessed
of such knowledge as enabled him to trace the
fea-coafR, to mention the most noted places
situated upon it, and to specify the longitude
and latitude of each from Cape Comorin east-
ward, to the utmost boundary of ancient naviL
gation. With regard to some diftrics, par-
ticularly along the eaR fide of the peninsula
as far as the mouth of the Ganges, the ac-
counts which he had received Ieem to have
been so far cxat, as to correspond more nea1ly

perhaps

perhaps with the aAual state of the country, s C T.
than the descriptions which he gives of any 11.
other part of India. M. D'Anville, with his
usual industry and discernment, has confidered
the principal flations as they are fixed by him,
and finds that they correspond to Kilkare, Ne-
gapatam, the mouth of the river Cauveri, Ma-
fulipatam, Point Gordeware, &c. It is foreign
to the objet of this Disquisition, to enter into
such a minute detail; but in several instances
we may observe, that not only the conformity
of position, but the similarity of ancient and
modern names, is very striking. The great
river Cauveri is by Ptolemy named Chaberis;
Arcot, in the interior country, is Arcati Regia;
and probably the whole coast has received its
present name of Coromandel from Sor Man-
dulan, or the kingdom of Sorre, which is situ-
ated upon it',

IN the course of one hundred and thirty-fix

years, which elapsed from the death of Strabo to
that of Ptolemy, the commercial intercourse with
India was greatly extended ; the latter geographer
had acquired such an acceflion of Cnew informa-
tion concerning the Ganges, that he mentions

- and describes their positions. His delineation,
~Lr howveer, of that part of India which lies

beyond the Ganges, is not less erroneous in its
general form, than that which he gave of the
peninsula, and bears as little resemblance to the
actual position of those countries. He ventures,
nevertheless, upon a survey of them, similar
to that which he had made of the other great
division of India, which I have already ex-
amined. He mentions the places of note
along the coast, some of which he distinguishes
as Emporia; but whether that name was given
to them on account of their being flaples of
trade to the natives, in their traffic carried
on from one diflrict of India to another, or
whether they were ports, to which vessels from
the Arabian Gulf resorted directly, is not fpe-
cified. The latter I should think to be the
idea which Ptolemy means to convey; but
these regions of India were so remote, and,
from the timid and flow course of ancient
navigation, were probably so little frequented, that
his information concerning them is extremely
defctive, and his descriptions more oblcurc,
more inaccurate, and less conformable to the
real tate of the country, than in any part of
his geography. That peninsula to which hc
gives the name of thc Golden Chcrfonefu.s,

he

he delineates as if it ftietched diretly from s e CT.
north to south, and fixes the latitude of Sabana II
Emporium, its southern extremity, three de.
grees beyond the line. To the east of this
peninsula he places, what he calls the Great
Bay, and in the most remote part of it the station
of Catigara, the utmost boundary of navigation
in ancient times, to which he assigns no less
than eight degrees and a half of southern lati-
tude. Beyond this, he declares the earth to
be altogether unknown, and asserts that the land
turns thence to the westward, and stretches in
that direction until it joins the promontory of
Praffurn in Ethiopia, which, according to his
idea, terminated the continent of Africa to
the south '. In consequence of this error, no
less unaccountable than enormous, he muff have
believed the Erythraan Sea, in its whole extent
from the coaff of Africa to that of Cambodia,
to be a vast bafon, without any communication
with the ocean "

o 4 vellers

~ E C T, vellers have involved the geography of Ptolemy,
II. M. D'Anville has attempted to bring order;

and, with much ingenuity, he has formed opi?
nions with rcfpe& to iome capital positions,
which have the appearance of being well founded.
The peninsula of Malacca is, according to him,
the Golden Cherfonefus of Ptolemy; but, in-
ltead of the direcion which he has given it, we
know that it bends some degrees towards the
east, and that Cape de Romania, its southern
extremity, is more than a degree to the north
of the line. The Gulf of Siam he confiders
as the Great Bay of Ptolemy, but the position
on the east fide of that Bay, corresponding to
Catigara, is a&ually as many degrees to the
north of the Equator, as he supposed it to be
south of it. Beyond this he mentions an inland
city, to which he gives the name of Thin:e or
Sina Metropolis. The longitude which he as-
signs to it, is qne hundred and eighty degrees
from his first meridian in the Fortunate Island,
and is the utmost point towards the East to
which the ancients had advanced by sea. Its
latitude he calculates to be three degrees south
of the line. If, with M. D'Anville, we con-
clude the fitqation of Sin-hoa, in the western
part of the kingdom of Cochin-China, to be
hie fame with Sinwi Metropolis, Vtolemy has

erred

erred in fixing its position no less than fifty de. s E T.
grees of longitude, and twenty degrees of lati- n.
tude.

THESE errors of Ptolemy concerning the

remote parts of Asia, have been rendered more
conspicuous by a mirtaken opinion of modern
times ingrafted upon them. Sina, the molt
distant station mentioned in his geography, has
such a near resemblance in found to China, the
name by which the greatest and most civilized
empire in the East is known to Europeans,
that, upon their first acquaintance with it, they
hastily concluded them to be the fame; and
of consequence it was supposed that China was
known to the ancients, though no point seems
to be more ascertained, than that they never
advanced by sea beyond that boundary which
I have allotted to their navigation.

HAVING thus traced the discoveries of India

which the ancients made by sea, I fllall next
examine what additional knowledge of that
country they acquired from their progress

by

s E C '. by land. It appears (as I have formerly related)

II. that there was a trade carried on early with India
'J 'rthrough the provinces that firetch along its

northern frontier. Its various producions and
manufactures were transported by land-carriage
into the interior parts of the Persian dominions, or
were conveyed, by means of the navigable rivers
w·hich flow through the Upper Asia,. to the Caf-
pian Sea and fron that to the Euxine. While
the successors of Seleucus retained the dominion
of the East, this continued to be the mode of
ihpplying their fubjets with the commodities
of India. When the Romans had extended
rheir conquests so far that the Euphrates was
the Eastern limit of their empire, they found
this trade ftil! established, and as it opened to them
a new communication with the Earl, by means
of which they received an additional supply of
luixurie;, fur which they had acquired the highest
rclifh, it became an objec of their policy to
protecA and encourage it. As the progress of
the caravans or companies of merchants, which
travelled towards the countries whence they
received the molt valuable manufactures, par-
ticularly those of silk, was often interrupted,
and rendered dangerous by the Parthians, who
had acquired pofleflior of all the provinces
which extend fiom the Caspian Sea to that part
(f Scythia or Tartary which borders on China,

the

the Romans endeavoured to render this intercourse s E c To
more secure by a negociation with one of the 1'
monarchs of that great empire. Of this fin-
gular tranfaEtion there is, indeed, no vestige in
the Greek or Roman writers; our knowledge
of it is derived entirely from the Chinese his-
torians, by whom we are informed that An-
toun, (the Emperor Marcus Antoninus,) the
king of the people of the Western Ocean, sent
an embassy with this view to Oun-ti, who reigned
over China in the hundred and fixty-fixth year
of the Christian aera Y. What was the success
of this attempt is not known, nor can we fay
whether it facilitated such an intercourse between
there two remote nations as contributed towards
the supply of their mutual wants. The design
certainly was, not unworthy of the enlightened-
eimperor of Rome to whom it is ascribed.

IT is evident, however, that in prosecuting

this trade with China, a considerable part of
the extensive countries to the east of the Caf-
pian Sea must have been traversed; and though
the chief inducement to undertake those distant
journies was gain, yet, in the course of ages,

jeds to thoie of more general concern. From
them such inforllmaloioln procu red, and fnbjeted
to scientific diftcufion, as enabled I'tolemy to give
a description of those inllnmd and remote regions
of AfiaZ, fully as accurate as that of several
countries, of which, fiom their vicinity, le may
have been supposed to have received more dif-
tint accounts. The farthest point towards the
East, to which his knowledge of this part of
Asia extended, is Scra Metropolis, which, from
various circunftances, appears to have been
in the fame situation with Kant-cheou, a city
of some note in Chen-fi, the most westerly pro-
vince of the Chinese empire. This he places
in the longitude of one hundred and seventy.
seven degrees fifteen minutes, near three degrees
to the weft of Sinc Metropolis, which he had
described as the utmost limit of Afla discovered
ly sea. Nor was Ptolemy's knowledge of this
dilrid of Asia confined only to that part of it
through which the caravans may be supposed
to have proceeded direItly in their route ealt-
ward; lie had received likewise some general

he gives them, occupied parts of the great i'.
plain of Tartary, extending considerably beyond
Lassa, the capital of Thibet, and the residence
of the Dalai Lama.

Tiir latitudes of several places in this part

of Asia are fixed by Ptolemy with such uncom-
mon precision, that we can hardly doubt of
their having been ascertained by aatual obferva-
ation. Out of many instances of this, I flall
feleEt three, of places situated in very different
parts of the country under review. The lati-
tude of Nagara, on the river Cophenes, (the
modern Attock,) is, according to Ptolemy,
thirty-two degrees and thirty minutes, which
coincides precisely with the observation of an
Eastern geographer quoted by MI. D'Anville".
The latitude of Maracanda, or Salnarcand, as
fixed by him, is thirty-nine degrees fifteen mi-
nutes. According to the Astronomical Tables of
Ulug Beg, the grandson of Tlil: r, xvhofe royal
residence was in that city, it is thirty-nine de-
grces thirty-feven minutes b. Tahe latitude of

degrees fifteen minutes ; that of K;an-cleou,

SE C T. as determined by the Jesuit Mifionaries, is

II. thirty-nine degrees. I have enumerated these

firiking examples of the coincidence of his cal-
culations with those etfablifhed by modern ob-
servations, for two reasons: One, because they
clearly prove that these remote parts of Asia
had been examined with some considerable
degree of attention; the other, because I feel
great fatisfac&ion, after having been obliged to
mention several errors and dcfects in Ptolemy's
geography, in rendering justice to a philosopher,
who has contributed so much towards the im-
provement of that science. The fads which
I have produced afford the strongest evidence
of the extent of his information, as well as'
the justness of his conclusions concerning coun-
tries with which, from their remote situation, we
might have supposed him to be least acquainted.

ITITHERTO I have confined my researches

concerning the knowledge which the an-
cients had of India, to the continent; I return
now to confider the discoveries which they had
made, of the islands situated in various parts
of tlhe ocean with which it is surrounded, and
begin, as I proposed, with Taprobane, the great-
eft and nmolt valuable of them. This island lay
so diredly in the course of navigators who ven-
tured beyond Cape Comorin, especially when,

I- - according

according to the ancient mode of failing, they s E c T.;
seldom ventured far from the coast, that its II.
position, one should have thought, must have
been determined with the utmofft precision.
There is, however, hardly any point in the geo;
graphy of the ancients more undecided and un-
certain. Prior. to the age of Alexander; the
Great, the name of Taprobane was unknown
in Europe. In consequence of the acive cu-
riofity with which he explored every coun-
try that he subdued or visited, some information
concerning it seems to have been obtained.'
From his time almost every writer on geogra-
phy has mentioned it, but their accounts of. it
are so various, and often so contradiaory, that
we can scarcely believe them to-be describing.
the fame island. Strabo, the earliest writer now
extant, from -whom we have any particular ac-
count of it, affirms that it was as large as Bri-
tain,, and fituated.at the distance of seven days,
according to tome reports, and according to
other, of twenty days failing from the southern
extremity of the Indian peninsula; from which,.
contrary to what is known to. be its real po-
fition, he describes it as Stretching towards the
xwef above five hundred fladia!. Pompo-
nius Mela, the author next in order of time, is

uncertain

s EC c r. uncertain whether he should confider Taprobane

as an island, or as the beginning of another
Lc ~world; but as no person, he fays, had ever

failed round it, he seems to incline towards the
latter opinion'. Pliny gives a more ample de-
scription of Taprobane, which, instead of bring-
ing any accession of light, involves every thing
relating to it in additional obscurity. After
enumerating the various and discordant opinions
of the Greek writers, he informs us, that am-
baffadors were sent by a king of that island to
the emperor Claudius, from whom the Romans
learned several things concerning it, which were
formerly unknown; particularly that there were
five hundred towns in the island, and that in the
centre of it there was a lake three hundred and
feventy-five miles in circumference. These
ambassadors were aitonifhed at the fight of the
Great Bear and the Pleiades,' being conrtellations
which did not appear in their sky; and were
still more amazed when they beheld their shadows
point towards the north, and the fun rife on their
left hand, and set on their right. They affirmed
too, that in their country the moon was never
seen until the eighth clay after the change, and
continued to be visible only to the sixteenth'.
It is surprising to find an author so intelligent

as Pliny relating all these 'circumstances without s E C To
animadversion, and particularly that he does nqt II.
take notice, that what the ambassadors re-
ported concerning the appearance of the moon,
could not take place in any region of the earth,

PToLEMY, though so near to the age of Pliny,
seems to have been altogether unacquainted with
his description of Taprobane, or with the emr
bafFy to the emperor Claudius. He places that
island opposite to Cape Comorin, at no great
distance from the continent, and delineates it
as stretching from north to south no less than
fifteen. degrees, two of which he supposes to be
south of the Equator; and if his representation
of its dimensions had been just, it was well en-
titled from its magnitude to be compared with
Britains. Agathemerus, who wrote after'Pto.
lemy, and was well acquainted with his geogra.
phy, confiders Taprobane as the largefi of all
islands, and assigns to Britain only the second
place .

FROM this diversity of the descriptions given
by ancient writers, it is not surprising that the

S E C T. 'moderns should have entertained very different

dian ocean which was to be confidered as the
fame with the Taprobane of the Greeks and
Romans. As both Pliny and Ptolemy describe
it as lying in part to the south of the Equator,
some learned men maintain Sumatra to be the
island which corresponds to this deferi-ptio.
But the great distance of Sumatra from the pe.
ninfula of India does not accord with any ac-
count which the Greek or Roman writers have
given of the fittation of Taprobane, and we
have no evidence that the navigation of the
ancients ever extended so far as Sumatra. The
opinion more generally received is, that the
'Taprobane of the ancients is the island of Cey.
Ion; and not only its vicinity to the continent
of India, but the general form of the island, as
delineated by Ptolemy, as well as the pofitioa
of several places in it, mentioned by him, efla.
blifi this opinion (notwithltanding some ex.
traordinary miflakes, of which I shall afterwards
take notice) with a great degree of certainty.

TF.SE other islands to the east of Taprobane,

mentioned by Ptolemy, might be shewn (if such
a detail were neccftary) to be the Andaman
and Nicobar lilands in the Gulf of Bengal.

AFTER

AFTER this long, and, I am afraid, tedious in- s E C T.

veftigation of the progress made by the ancients, , "
in exploring the different parts of India, and
after tracing them as far as they advanced to-
wards the East, either by sea or land, I ihall
offer some general remarks concerning the mode
in which their discoveries were conduEted, and
the degree of confidence with which we may
rely on the accounts of them, which could not
have been offered with the fame advantage
until this investigation was finished.

THE art of delineating maps, exhibiting either

the figure of the whole earth, as far as it had
been explored, or that of particular countries,
was known to the ancients; and without the
use of them to aflift the imagination, it was
impossible to have formed a diftin& idea either
of the one or of the other. Some of these maps
are mentioned by Herodotus, and other early
Greek writers. But no maps prior to those
which were formed in order to illustrate the
geography of Ptolemy, have reached our times,
in consequence of which it is very difficult to
conceive what was the relative situation of the
different places mentioned by the ancient
geographers, unless when it is precisely
ascertained by meafuremlenth. As soon, how-

h See NOTE XXXIV.

H 2 ever,

s E C T. ever, as the mode of marking the situation

I'. o£ each place by specifying its longitude and

latitude was introduced, and came to be ge.
nerally adopted, every position could be de.
fcribed in compendious and scientific terms.
But Rtill the accuracy of this new method, and
the improvement which geography derived from
it, depends upon the mode in which the ancients
estimated the latitude and longitude of places.

THOUGHI the ancients proceeded in determin-

ing the latitude and longitude of places upon
the fame principles with the moderns, yet it
was by means of instruments very inferior in
their construction to those now used, and with.
out the fame minute attention to every circum-
stance that may asset the accuracy of an ob-
servation, an attention of which long experience
only can demonstrate the necessity. In order to
ascertain the latitude of any place, the ancients
observed the meridian altitude of the fun, either
by means of the shadow of a perpendicular
gnomon, or by means of an astrolabe, from
which it was easy to compute how many.de-
grecs and minutes the place of observation
ivas diflant from the Equator. When neither of
these nctlhods could be employed, they inferred
the latitude of any place from the belt accounts
which itlry could procure of the length of its
longcft day.

WIreH

WITH refpeE to determining the longitude s E e T.

of any place, they were much more at a 1qy, I.
as there was only one set of celestial phenomena
to which they could have recourse. These
were the eclipses of the moon (for those of the
fun were not then so well underitood as to be
subservient to the purposes of geography): the
difference between the time at which an eclipse
was observed to begin or to end at two dif-
ferent places, gave immediately the difference
between the meridians of those places. But
the difficulty of making those observations with
accuracy, and the impossibility of repeating
them often, rendered them of so little use in
geography, that the ancients in determining lon-
gitudes were obliged, for the most part, to have
recourse to aCtual surveys, or to the vague in-
formation which was to be obtained from the
reckonings of sailors, or the itineraries of tra-
vellers.

BUT though the ancients, by means of the

operations which I have mentioned, could
determine the position of places with a
considerable degree of accuracy at land, it is
very uncertain whether or not they had any
proper mode of determining this at sea. The
navigators of antiquity teem rarely to have had

11 3 rccourfe

S E C T. recourse to astronomical observation. They

II. had no infIruments suited to a moveable and

uniteady observatory; and though by their prac-
tice of landing frequently, they might, in some
measure, have supplied that defeft, yet no an.
cient author, as far as I know, has given an ac-
count of any aitronomical observation made by.
them during the course of their voyages. It
seems to be evident from Ptolemy, who employs
some chapters in flewing how geography may
be improved, and its errors may be rectified,
from the reports of navigators', that all their
calculations were founded solely upon reckoning,
and were not the result of observation. Ever}
after all the improvements which the moderns
have made in the science of navigation, this
mode of computing by reckoning is known
to be so loose and uncertain, that, from it alone,
no conclusion can be deduced with any great de.
gree of precision. Among the ancients, this inac-
curacy muff have been greatly augmented, as
they were accuflomed in their voyages, inflead
of steering a direct course which might have
been nore easily measured, to a circuitous
navigation along the coast; and were unac-
quainted with the coinpals, or any other infiru,
nent by which its bearings ,night have been

i Lib. i. c. 7 .afc

afccr-

ascertained. We find, accordingly, the position s E C T,
of many places which we may suppose to have I.
been determined at sea, fixed with little exaanefs, --
When, in consequence of an active trade, the
ports of any country were much frequented, the
reckonings of different navigators may have
served in some measure to correct each other,
and may have enabled geographers to form their
conclusions with a nearer approximation to
truth. But in remote countries, which have
neither been the feat of military operations, nor
explored by caravans travelling frequently
through them, every thing is more vague and
undefined, and the resemblance between the
ancient descriptions qs them, and their atual
figure, is often so faint that it can hardly be
traced. The latitude of places too, as might
be expeted, was in general much more ac-
curately known by the ancients than their lon-
gitude. The qbferyations by which the former
was determined ate simple, made with ease,
and are not liable to much error. The other
cannot be ascertained precisely, without more

had no ilnfruments suited to a moveable and
unfleady observatory; and though by their prac-
tice of landing frequently, they might, in some
measure, have supplied that defet, yet no an.
cient author, as far as I know, has given an ac-
count of any agtronomical observation made by.
them during the course of their voyages. It
seems to be evident from Ptolemy, who employs
some chapters in flewing how geography may
be improved, and its errors may be recified,
from the reports of navigators', that all their
calculations were founded solely upon reckoning,
and were not the result of observation. Every
after all the improvements which the moderns
have made in the science of navigation, this
mode of computing by reckoning is knowrl
to be so loose and uncertain, that, from it alone,
no conclusion can be deduced with any great de-
gree of precision. Among the ancients, this inac-
curacy must have been greatly augmented, as
they were accuflomed in their voyages, inisead
of fleering a direc course which might have
been more easily measured, to a circuitous
navigation along the coast; and were unac-
quainted with the compals, or any other inflru,

When, in consequence of an ative trade, the
ports of any country were much frequented, the
reckonings of different navigators may have
served in fomen measure to correc each other,
and may have enabled geographers to form their
conclusions with a nearer approximation to
truth. But in remote countries, which have
neither been the feat of rrilitary operations, nor
explored by caravans travelling frequently
through them, every thing is more vague and
undefined, and the resemblance between the
ancient descriptions of them, and their actual
figure, is often so faint that it can hardly be
traced. The latitude of places too, as might
be expeEted, was in general much more ac-
curately known by the ancients than their lon-
gitude. The qbferyations by which the former
was determined are simple? made with ease,
and are not liable to much error. The other

S E C T. Ptolemy, I know not if he approaches as near

C~~ done in fixing the latitude of the three cities

which I formerly mentioned as a striking,
though not singular, instance of his exa&nefs.

THESE observations induce me to adhere to

an opinion, which I proposed in another place',
that the Greeks and Romans, in their commercial
intercourse with India, were seldom led, either
by curiosity or the love of gain, to visit the
more eastern parts of it. A variety of parti.
culars occur to confirm this opinion. Though
Ptolemy beflows the appellation of Emnporia
on several places' situatecd on the coast, which
firetches from the eaRern mouth of the Ganges
to the extremity of the Golden Cherfonefus, it
is uncertain, whether from his having given
them this name, v.e are to confider them as
harbours frequented by ships from Egypt, or
merely by veffcls of the country. Beyond the
GQlden Cherfonefus, it is remarkable that he
mentions one tiEporium only"', which plainly
indicates the intcrcourfe with this region of In-
dia to have been very inconsiderable. HIad

titled

titled Ptolemy to specify so minutely the Ion- s Ec T.
gikude and latitude of the great number of u.
places which he mentions, he must, in confe-
quence of this, have acquired such information
as would have prevented several great errors
into which he has fallen. Had it been usual to
double Cape Comorin, and to fail up the Bay
of Bengal to the mouth of the Ganges, some of
the ancient geographers would not have been
so uncertain, and others so widely mistaken, with
refipect to the situation and magnitude of the
ifiand of Ceylon. If the merchants of Alex-
andria had often visited the ports of the Gold-
en Cherfonefus, and of the Great Bay, Pto.
lemy's descriptions of them muff have been ren-
dered more correspondent to their real form,
nor could he have believed several places to lie
beyond the line, which are in truth some degrees
on this fide of it.

BUT though the navigation of the ancients

may not have extended to the farther India,
we are certain that various commodities of that
country were imported into Egypt, and thence
vwere conveyed to Rome, and to other parts
of the Empire. Prom circumitances which I
have already enumerated, \ve are warranted in
concluding, that these were brought in vessels of
lth country to Mufiris, and to the other ports on

S the

E c T. the Malabar coast, which were, at that period,
nI. the staples of trade with Egypt. In a country
L*'--' of such extent as India, where the natural pro.

duaions are various, and greatly diversified by
art and industry, an adive domefic commerce,
both by sea and by land, must have early taken
place among its different provinces. Of this
we have some hints in ancient authors; and
where the sources of information are so few
and so scanty, we must reft satisfied with hints.
Among the different classes or casts, into which
the people of India wvere divided, merchants are
mentioned as one , from which we may con.
clude trade to have been one of the established
occupations of men in that country. From the
Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ery,
thrucan Sea, we learn that the inhabitants of the
Coromandel coast traded in veflels of their own
with thloie of Malabar; that the interior trade
of Barygaza was considerable; and that there
was, at all seasons, a number of country flips
to be found in the harbopr of k4ufiris . By
Strabo w'e are informed, that the molt valuable
produ4cions of Taprobane were carried to dif-
fcicnt lfnlpolria of India '. In this way th9
traders from Egypt Imight be supplied with
them, and thus could finish their voyages within

the

the year, which must have been protraAed much s E c T,
longer if they had extended as far towards the Ii.
East as is generally supposed.

FROM all this it appears to be probable, that

Ptolemy derived the information concerning the
eastern parts of India, upon which he founds his
calculations, not so much from any direEt and
regular intercourse between Egypt and these
countries, as from the reports of a few adven-
turers, whom an enterprising spirit, or the love
cf gain, prompted to proceed beyond the usual
limits of navigation.

THIOUGH, from the age of Ptolemy, the trade

with India continued to be carried on in its for-
mer channel, and both Rome, the ancient
capital of the empire, and Conttantinople, the
new feat of government, were supplied with the
precious commodities of that country by the
merchants of Alexandria, yet, until the reign of
the emperor Justinian, we have no new
information concerning the intercourse with the
East by sea, or the progress which was made in
the discovcry of its remote regions. Under
Justinian, Cofinas, an Egyptian merchant, in
the course of his traffic, made some voyages
to India, whence he acquired the firname of
lndlicoplcuftes; but afterwards, by a transition

sure of a cell, he composed several works, one
of which, dignified by him with the name of
Chritian Topography, has reached us. The
main design of it is to combat the opinion of
those philosophers, who aflert the earth to be
of a spherical figure, and to prove that it is an
oblong plane, of twelve thousand miles in length
from eafl to weft, and of fix thousand miles in
breadth from north to south, surrounded by
high walls, covered by the firmament as with a
canopy or vault; that the viciflitude of day and
night was occasioned by a mountain of prodi-
gious height, situated in the extremities of the
north, round which the fun moved; that
when it appeared on one fide of this mountain,
the earth was illuminated, when concealed on
the other fide, the earth was left involved in
larkhnefs'. But amidst those wild reveries,
more suitcd to the credulity of his new profef.
sion, than to the found sense characeriltic of that
in which he was formerly engaged, Cofmas seens
to relate what he himlflf had obfcrv-cd in his tra-
els, or what lie had learned fromn others, with
£reat simplicity and regard for truth.

the weft coafl of the Indian peninsula, and names I.
several places situated upon it; he describes it -" -
as the chief feat of the pepper trade, and men-
tions Male, in particular, as one of the most
frequented ports on that accountr. From Male,
it is probable that this fide of the continent has
derived its modern name of Malabar; and the
cluster of islands contiguous to it, that of the
Maldives. From him too we learn, that the
ifand of Taprobane, which he supposes to lie
at an equal distance from the Persian Gulf on
the weft, and the country of the Sinae on the
east, had become, in consequence of this com-
modious situation, a great staple of trade; that
into it were imported the silk of the Sinae, and
the precious spices of the Eastern countries,
which were conveyed thence to all parts of
India, to Persia, and to the Arabian Gulf. To
this island he gives the name of Sielediba ,
nearly the fame with that of Selendib, or Se-
rendib, by which it is still known all over the
East.

To Cofmas we are also indebted for the first

information of a new rival to the Romans in
trade having appeared in the Indian seas. The

.s c T. Persians, after having overturned the empire

rI of the Parthians, and re-established the line of
v^ ': their ancient monarchs, seem to have surmounted

entirely the aversion of their anceflors to maritime
exertions and made early and vigorous efforts
in order to acquire a share in the lucrative com.
merce with India. All its considerable ports
were frequented by traders from Persia, who,
in return for some productions of their own
country in request among the Indians, received
the precious commodities, which they conveyed
up the Persian Gulf, and by means of the great
rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, distributed them
through every province of their empire. As
the voyage from Persia to India was much
flhorter than that from Egypt, and attended with
less expence and danger, the intercourse between
the two countries increased rapidly. A cir.
cumftance is mentioned by Cofmas which is a
firiking proof of this. In most of the cities of any
note in India he found Christian churches elfa-
blilhed, in which the funcions of religion were
performed by priests ordained by the archbilhop
of Seleucia, the capital of the Persian empire,
and who continued fubjcct to his jurifdidion'.
India appears to have been more thoroughly
explored at this period, than it was in the age

c Cofin. lib. iii. 178.o

of

of Ptolemy, and a greater number of strangers s E c Ti
seem to have been fettled there. It is remark- I,
able, however, that, according to the account
of Cofmasy none of these firangers were accuf-
toned to visit the eastern regions of Asia, but
relted satisfied with receiving their fillk,
their spices, and other valuable producions,
as they were imported into Ceylon, and con-
veyed thence to the various marts of India u.

THE frequency of open hostilities between the

emperors of Constantinople and the monarchs
of Persia, together with the increasing rivalihip
of their subje&s in the trade with India, gave
rife to an event which produced a considerable
change in the nature of that commerce. As
the use of silk, both in dress and furnitre,
became gradually mote general in the court of
the Greek emperors, who imitated and surpassed
the sovereigns of Asia in splendour and mag-
nificencc; and as China, in which, according to
the concurring testimony of Oriental writers,
the culture of silk was originally known x, still
continued to be the only country which pro-
duced that valuable commodity: the Persians,
improving the advantages which their situation

C*L- to which silk was brought by sea from the East,

Having it likewise in their power to rmoleft or
to cut off the caravans, which, in order to pro.
cure a supply for the Greek empire, travelled
by land to China through the northern provinces
of their kingdom, they entirely engrossed that'
branch of commerce. Conflantinople was ob-
liged to depend on a rival power for an article
which luxury viewed and desired as elffntial
to elegance. T'he Persians, with the usual ra.
pacity of monopolists, raised the price of silk
to such an exorbitant height ', that Justinian,
eager not only to obtain a full and certain supply
of a commodity which was become of indifpenf-
able use, but solicitous to deliver the com-
merce of his fubjecs from the exacions of his
enemies, endeavoured, ly means of his ally,
the Christian monarch of Ab)flini4, to wrefl
some portion of the silk trade from the Persians.
In this attempt he failed ; but when he least ex-
A.D. S peEed it, he, by an unforeseen event-attained,

in some mneafure, the object which he had in
view. Two Persian monks having been em.
ployed as miflionaries in some of the Chriitian
churches, which were eftabliffied (as we are in-

formed by Cofmas) in different parts of India, s E c T.
had penetrated into the country of the Seres, II.
or China. There they observed the labours l u
of the silk-worm, and became acquainted with
all the arts of man in working up its producions
into such a variety of elegant fabrics. The
profpet of gain, or perhaps an indignant zeal,
excited by teeing. this lucrative branch of com-
merce engrossed by unbelieving nations, prompted
them to repair to Constantinople.. There they
explained to the emperor the originof silk, as
well as the various modes of preparing and ma-
nuiacturing it, mysteries hitherto unknown, or
very imperfeEtly understood, in Europe; and
encouraged by his liberal promises, they under-
took to bring to the capital a fuficient number
of those wonderful infeEts, to whole labours
iman is so much indebted. This they accom-
plifhcd by conveying the eggs of the lilk-wormn
in a hollow cane. They were hatched by the
heat of a dunghill, fed with the leaves of a wild
mulberry tree, and they multiplied and worked
in the i' ne nanner as in those climates where
they first became objeCts of human attention
and care . Vast numbers of thefc infects were
loon reared in different parts of Greece, particu-
larly in the Peloponefus. Sicily afterwards under-

and was imitated, from time to time, in several
towns of Italy. In all these places extensive
manufactures were eltabliihed, and carried on,
with silk of domefttic production. The demand
for silk from the East diminished of course, the
subjects of the Greek emperors were no longer
obliged to have recourse to the Persians for a
supply of it, and a considerable change took
place in the nature of the\commercial intercourse
between Europe and India.

when they sallied out to plunder a caravan, or
to rob a traveller. In some diftrits, however,
they had begun to add the labours of agricul.
ture, and the business of commerce, to the oc-
cupations of pastoral life . These different
orders of men, when prompted by the enthu-
fiaftic ardour with which the exhortations and
example of Mahomet inspired them, displayed,
at once, all the zeal of miflionaries, and the
ambition of conquerors. They spread the doc-
trine of their prophet, and extended the domi-
nion of his successors, from the ihores of the
Atlantic to the frontier of China, with a ra-
pidity of success to which there is nothing similar
. in the history of mankind. Egypt was one of

their carlieft conquests; and as they fettled in
that inviting country, and kept pofieflion of it,
the Greeks were excluded from all intercourse
with Alexandria, to which they had long re-
forted as the chief mart of Indian goods. Nor
was this the only effect which the progress of

of

of Europe with India. Prior to their invasion s E c T.
of Egypt, the Arabians had subdued the great I.I
kingdom of Persia, and added it to the empire
of their Caliphs. They found their new sub-
jets engaged in prosecuting that extensive trade
with India, and the country to the east of it, the
commencement and progress of which in Persia
I have already mentioned; and they were so
sensible of the great advantages derived from it,
that they became desirous to partake of them.
As the aCtive powers of the human mind, when
routed to vigorous exertions in one line, are
molR capable of operating with force in other
direCtions; the Arabians, from impetuous war-
riors, Ioon became enterprising merchants.
They continued to carry on the trade with
India in its former channel from the Persian
Gulf, but it was with that ardour which cha-
racerifes all the early efforts of Mahomet's
followers. In a short time they advanced far
beyond the boundaries of ancient navigation,
and brought many of the most precious com-
modities of the East directly from the countries
which produced them. In order to engross all
the profit arising from the sale of them, the
Caliph O(mar h, a few years after the conquest
of Persia, founded the city of Baffora, on the

a view of securing the command of these twq
rivers, by which goods imported from India
were conveyed into all parts of Asia. With
such discernment was the situation chosen, that
Baifora soon became a place of trade hardly in.
ferior to Alexandria.

THIS general information with refpeR to the

trade of the Arabians with India, which is all
that can be derived from the historians of that
period, is confirmed and illustrated by the Re-
lation of a Voyage from the Persian Gulf to.
wards the East, written by an Arabian merchant
in the year of the Christian sera eight hundred
and fifty-one, about two centuries after Persia
was fubjeted to the Caliphs, and explained by
the Commentary of another Arabian, who had
likewise visited the Eastern parts of Asia c. This
curious Relation, which enables us to fill up a
chasm in the history of mercantile communica-
tion with India, furnishes materials for defcrib-
ing more in detail the extent of the Arabian
discoverics in the East, and the manner ip which
they made them.

circumstance which seems to have been little

that in this branch of science they were far fu,

of it, particularly, as I have formerly related, in I1.
the Island of Ceylon. When the Arabians ex-
tended their navigation as far as China, a more
ample field, both for their commerce and their
zeal, opened to their view. If we may rely on
the concurring evidence of Christian authors,
in the East as well as in the Weft, confirmed
by the testimony of the two Mahomedan tra-
vellers, their pious labours were attended with
such success, that in the ninth and tenth centu-
ries the number of Christians in India and China
was very considerable". As the churches in
both these countries received all their eccle-
fiaftics from Persia, where they were ordained
by the Catholicos, or Neftorian Primate, whose
supremacy they acknowledged, this became a
regular channel of intercourse and intelligence;
and to the combined effet of all these circum-
itances, we are indebted for the information we
receive from the two Arabians writers°, con:-

and Romans never visited.

S E C T. knowledge of the East, the people of Europe

I1- found themselves excluded almost entirely from

any intercourse with it. To them the great
port of Alexandria was now {hut, and the new
lords of the Persian Gulf, satisfied with supply-
ingthe demand for Indian commodities in their
own extensive dominions, neglected to convey
them, by any of the usual channels, to the
trading towns on the Mediterranean. The
opulent inhabitants of Constantinople, and other
great cities of Europe, bore this deprivation of
luxuries, to which they had been long accuf-
tomed, with such impatience, that all the aci-
vity of commerce was exerted, in order to find
a remedy for an evil which they deemed in-
tolerable. The difficulties which were to be
surmounted in order to accomplish this, afford
the most striking proof of the high estimation
in which the commodities of the East were held
at that time. The silk of China was purchased
in Chenfi, the westernmost province of that
empire, and conveyed thence by a caravan, in
a march of eighty or a hundred days, to the
banks of the Oxus, wheIe it was embarked, and
carried down the fiream of that river to the
(Capian. After a dangerous voyage across that
sea, and afccnding the river Cyrus as far as it is
navigable, it was conducted by a short land-

5 carriage

carriage of five days to the river Phafis P, which s E c T.
falls into the Euxine or Black Sea. Thence, ihr.
by an easy and well known course, it was tranf- G
ported to Constantinople. The conveyance of
commodities from that region of the East, now
known by the name of Indoftan, was somewhat
less tedious and operose. They were carried
from the banks of the Indus, by a route early
frequented, and which I have already described,
either to the river Oxus, or directly to the Caf-
pian, from which they held the fame course to
Constantinople.

IT is obvious, that only commodities of small

bulk, and of considerable value, could bear the
expence of such a mode of conveyance; and in
regulating the price of those commodities, not
only the expence, but the risk and danger of
conveying them, were to be taken into account.
In their journey across the vast plain extending
from Samarcande to the frontier of China, car,-
vans were exposed to the afaults and depreda-
tions of the Tartars, the Huns, the Turks, and
other roving tribes which infefl the north-eart
of Asia, and which have always confidered the
merchant and traveller as their lawful prey; nor
were they exempt from insult and pillage in their

journey

s E C T. journey from the Cyrus to the Phafis, through

"l. the kingdom of Colchis, a country noted, both

in ancient and in modern times, for the thievish
disposition of its inhabitants. Even under all
these disadvantages, the trade with the East was
carried on with ardour. Constantinople became
a considerable mart of Indian and Chinese comn
modities, and the wealth which flowed into it
in consequence of this, not only added to the
splendour of that great city, but seems to have
retarded, for tome time, the decline of the emi
pire of which it was the capital.

As far as we may venture to conjecture, from

tile irmperfect information of contemporary hifto:
rians, it was chiefly by the mode of conveyance
which I have described, perilous and operose as
it vas, that Europe was supplied with the com-
nlodities of the East, during more than two
centuries. Throughout that period the Christians
and Malhmcdans were engaged in altnoft unin,
tcrrupted hostilities; prosecuted with all the
mninlofity uhich rivalfhip for power, heightened
by religious zeal, naturally excites. Under cir-
cumftances which occasioned such alienation,
conmmrcial intercourse could hardly subsist, and
the merchants of Christendom either did not
resort at all to Alexandria, and the ports of
Syria, the ancient flaples for the commodities

of

of the East, after they were in possession of the s E e TE
MaIhomedans, or if the love of gain, surmount ilI.
ing their abhorrence of the Infidels, prompted '" -
them to visit the marts which they had long fre-
quented, it was with much caution and distrust.

WHILE the difficulties of procuring the pro.

duetions of the East were thus augmented, the
people of Europe became more desirous of
obtaining them. About this time some cities
of Italy, particularly Amalphi and Venice,
having acquired a greater degree of security or
independence than they formerly possessed,
began to cultivate the arts of domestic industry,
with an ardour and ingenuity uncommon in the
middle ages. The effet of these exertions was
such an increase of wealth, as created new wants
and desires, and formed a taste for elegance
and luxury, which induced them to visit foreign
countries it order to gratify it. Among men
in this flage of their advancement, the produc.
tions of India have always been held in high
estimation, and from this period they were
imported into Italy in larger quantities, and
came into more general use. Several circum-
fiances which indicate this revival of a com-
mercial spirit, are colleAed by the industrious
Muratori, and, from the close of the seventh

4 century,

S E c T. century, an attentive observer may discern faint

nr. traces of its progress q.

EVEN in enlightened ages, when the tranf-

adions of nations are observed and recorded
with the greatest care, and the itore of historical
materials seems to be abundantly ample, so little
attention has been paid to the operations of
commerce, that every attempt towards a re-
gular deduEtion of them, has been found an
undertaking of the utmofr difficulty. The sra,
however, to which I have conduEted this Dif.
quifition, is one of the periods in the annals
of mankind concerning which history furnishes
nmot scanty information. As it was chiefly in the
Greek empire, and in tome cities of Italy, that
any efforts were made to procure the com-
modities of India, and the other regions of the
East, it is only from the Historians of those
countries we can expect to find any account of
that trade. But from the age of Mahomet,
until the time when the Comneni ascended the
throne ofConflantinople, a period of more than
four centuries and a half, the Byzantine history
is contained in meagre chronicles, the com-

pilersof which seldom extended theirviews beyond S E C T.
the intrigues in the palace, the factions in the III.
theatre, or the disputes of theologians. To them r-
the monkish annalists of the different tfates and
cities of Italy, during the fame period, are (if
possible) far inferior in merit, and in the early
accounts of those cities which have been most
celebrated for their commercial spirit, we search
with little success for the origin or nature of that
trade by which they firfi rose to eminencer.
It is Inaiiifeflt, however, from the flightet at-
tention to the events which happened in the
seventh and eighth centuries, that the Italian
flates, while their coasts were continually in.
fcdted by the Mahomedans, who had made some
fettlcments there, and had fubjeded Sicily almost
entirely to their dominion, could not trade with
much confidence and security in Fgypt and
Syria. With what implacable hatred Christians
viewed Mahomedans, as the disciples of an im-
poflor, is well known; and as all the nations
which profelfed the Christian faith, both in the
:,ia and Weft, had mingled the worship of
an;iels and faints with that of the Supreme
Biiing, and had adorned their churches with
pidurls and statues; the true Moslems con-

animosity, so far as to render intercourse in any

MEANWHII.E a taste for the luxuries of the

East continued not only to spread in Italy, but,
from imitation of the Italians, or from some
improvement in their own situation, the people
of Marseilles, and other towns of France on the
Mcditerranean, became equally fond of them.
But the profits exaced by the merchants of
Amalphi or Venice, from whom they received
those precious commodities, were so exorbitant
as prompted them to make some effort to supply
their own demands. With this view, they
not only opened a trade with Conflantinople,
but ventured at times to visit the ports of Egypt
and Syria'. This eagerness of the Europeans,
on the one hand, to obtain the produOtions of
India, and on the other hand, considerable ad-
vantages which both the Caliphs and their sub.
jets derived from the sale of them, induced both
so far to conceal their reciprocal antipathy, as to
carry on a traffic manifestly for their common
benefit. How far this traffic extended, and

in

in what mode it was conducted by these new s E C T.
adventurers, the scanty information which can be II.
gathered from contemporary writers, does not
enable me to trace with accuracy. It is pro-
bable, however, that this communication would
have produced insensibly its usual effect, of
fatmiliarizing and reconciling men of hostile
principles and discordant manners to one another,
and a regular commerce might have been
eftablifled gradually between Christians and
MIahomedans, upon such equal terms, that the
nations of Europe might have received all the
luxuries of the East, by the fame channels in
which they were formerly conveyed to them,
first by the Tyrians, then by the Greeks of
Alexandria, next by the Romans, and at last
by the fubjets of the Conftantinopolitan em-
pire.

BUT whatever might have been the influence

of this growing correspondence, it was prevented
from operating with full efficd by the Crusades,
or expeditions for the recovery of the Holy
Land, which, during two centuries, occupied
the profefors of the two rival religions, and
contributed to alienate them more than ever
from each other. I have, in another work',

s E c T. contemplated mankind while under the dominion

nn of this frenzy, the most singular, perhaps, and

the longest continued, of any that occurs in the
history of our species; and I pointed out such
effeEts of it upon government, upon property,
upon manners and taste, as were suited to what
were then the objets of my enquiry. At pre-
sent my attention is confined to observe the
commercial consequences of the Crusades, and
how far they contributed to retard, or to pro.
more, the conveyance of Indian commodities
into Europe.

To fix an idea of peculiar fandity to that

country, which the Author of our Religion
feleeted as the place of his residence while on
earth, and in which he accomplished the re-
demption of mankind, is a sentiment so natural
to the human mind, that, from the first efla-
blihment of Christianity, the visiting of the holy
places in Judea was confidered as an cxercile
of piety, tending powerfully to awaken and to
chcrifh a spirit of devotion. Through fuc-
ceeding ages, the practice continued, and in-
creascd in every part of Christendom. When
jerusalem was fubjeted to the Mahomedan
empire, and danger was added to the fatigue
and cxpence of a distant pilgrimage, the under-
taking was viewed as still more meritorious.

It

It was sometimes enjoined as a penance to be s E c T.
performed by heinous tranfgreflbrs. It was I.
more frequently a duty undertaken with volurn- .'-'
tary zeal, and in both cafes it was deemed an
expiation for all part offences. From various
caules, which I have elsewhere enumeratedt,
there pious visits to the Holy Land multiplied
amazingly during the tenth and eleventh cen-
turies. Not only individuals in the lower and
middle ranks of life, but persons of superior
condition, attended by large retinues, and nu-
merous caravans of opulent pilgrims, resorted
to Jcrufalem.

IN all their operations, however, men have

a wonderful dexterity in mingling some attention
to interest with' those funitions which seem
to be most purely spiritual. The Mahomedan
caravans, which, in obedience to the injunctions
of their religion, visit the holy temple of Mecca,
are not composed, as I shall hereafter explain
more fully, of devout pilgrims only, but of
merchants, who, both in going and returning,
are provided with Ifch an assortment of goods,
tiat they carry on a considerable traffic ". Even

S E C T. seems to elevate them above all solicitude about

lir, the concerns of this world, have rendered their

frequent pilgrimages subservient to their interest,
by trading in every country through which
they travel x In like manner, it was not by
devotion alone that such numerous bands of
Christian pilgrims were induced to visit Jerufa-
lem. To many of them commerce was the
chief motive of undertaking that diflant voyage,
and by exchanging the productions of Europe
for the more valuable commodities of Asia, par.
ticularly those of India, which at that time
were diffused through every part of the Caliphs
dominions, they enriched themfclves, and fur.
nifhed their countrymen with such an additional
supply of Eastern luxuries, as augmented their
relish for them Y.

BUT how faint soever the lines may be, which,

prior to the Crusades, mark the influence of
the frequent pilgrimages to the Ealt upon com-
merce, they become so conspicuous after the
commencement of these expeditions, as to meet
the eye of every obt:rvcr. Various circum-
itances concurred towards this, from an enu-

mceration

meration of which it will appear, that by attend- s E c T.
ing to the progress and effeAs of the Crusades, I.
considerable light is thrown upon the fubjeEt '
of my inquiries. Great armies, condu&ed by
the most illustrious princes and nobles of Europe,
and composed of men of the most enterprising
Ipirit in all the kingdoms of it, marched towards
Palestine, through countries far advanced beyond
those which they left, in every species of im-
provement. They beheld the dawn of pro.
fperity in the republics of Italy, which had be-
gun to vie with each other in the arts of industry,
and in their efforts to engross the lucrative com-
merce with the East. They next admired the
more advanced state of opulence and splendour
in Constantinople, raised to a pre-eminence
above all the cities then known, by its extensive
trade, particularly that which it carried on with
India, and the countries beyond it. They after.
wards served in those provinces of Asia through
which the commodities of the East were usually
conveyed, and became matters of several cities
which had been staples of that trade. They
clablifhed the kingdom of Jerusalem, which
lubfiftcd near two hundred years. They took
pnlefflion of the throne of the Greek empire,
and govcrned it above half a century. Amidst
fitch a variety of events and operations, the
idl(ns o' the fierce warriors of Europe gradually

S E C T. opened and improved; they became acquainted

mI., with the policy and arts of the people whom

~^ ~
they subdued ; they observed the fdurces of

their wealth, and availed themselves of all this
knowledge. Antioch and Tyre, when con.
quered by the Crusaders, were flourishing cities,
inhabited by opulent merchants, who supplied
all the nations trading in the Mediterranean.
with the productions of the East , and as far
as can be gathered from incidental occurrences,
mentioned by the Historians of the Holy War,
who, being mostly priests and monks, had their
attention direced to objets very different from
those relating to commerce, there is reason to
believe that both in Conifanltinople, while subjef
to the Franks, and in the ports of Syria acquired
by the Christians, the long-eftablifled trade with
the East continued to be protected and en.
couraged.

BUT though commerce may have been only

a secondary object with the martial leaders
of the Crusades, engaged in perpetual hostilities
with the Turks on one hand, and with the Soldans
of Egypt on the other, it was the primary objet
with the associates, in conjunction with whom

they

they carried on their operations. Numerous S E c T.
as the armies were which alfumed the cross, llI.
and enterprising as the fanatical zeal was with
which they were animated, they could not
have accomplished their purpose, or even have
reached the feat of their warfare, without fe-
curing the afliltance of the Italian flates. None
of the other European powers could either fur-
nifh a sufficient number of transports to convey
the armies of the Crusaders to the coast of
Dalmnatia, whence they marched to Conflanti-
nople, the place of general rendezvous; or were
able to supply them with military fiores and
provisions in such abundance as to' enable them
to invade a distant country. In all the fuccef-
five expeditions the fleets of the Genoese, of
the Pifans, or 'of the Venetians, kept on the
coast as the armies advanced by land, and sup-
plying them from time to time with whatever
was wanting, engrossed all the profits of a branch
of commerce, which, in every age, has been
extremely lucrative. It was with all the in-
terested attention of merchants, that the Italians
afforded their aid. On the reduction of any
place in which they found it for their interest to
lettle, they obtained from the Crusaders va-
luable immunities of different kinds; freedom
of trade; an abatement of the usual duties paid
Ior what was imported and exported, or a total

exemption

. E c T. exemption from them; the property of entire

II!. suburbs in ibme cities, and of extensive streets
l-T in others; and a privilege granted to every

person who resided within their precincs, or
who traded under their protetion, of being
tried by their own laws, and by judges of their
own appointmenta. In consequence of so
many advantages we can trace, during the pro-
grefs of the Crusades, a rapid increase of wealth
and of power in all the commercial states of
Italv. Every port open to trade was fre.
uel:nted by their merchants, who, having now
ecngroiled entirely the commerce of the East,
ilrovc with lilch active emulation to find new
markets for the commodities which it furnished,
that they extended a taste for them to many parts
of Europe in which they had hitherto been
little known,

w'lo events happened, prior to the termina-

tion of the lIoly War, which, by acquiring to
tiic Venetians and Genoese the poffeflion of
Icveral provinces in the Greek empire, enabled
them to supply Europe more abundantly with

\renctians,

Venetians, and the leaders of the fourth Crusade. s E C T.
An account of the political interests and in- IllI
trigues which formed this alliance, and turned
the hallowed arms destined to deliver the Holy
City from the dominion of infidels, against a
Christian monarch, is foreign from the design
of this Disquisition. Confltantinople was taken
by storm, and plundered by the confederates.
An earl of Slanders was placed on the Imperial
throne. The dominions which still remained sub-
jea to the successors of Constantine, were divided
into four parts, one of which being allotted to
the new emperor, for supporting the dignity
and expence of government, an equal par-
tition of the other three was made between the
Venetians, and the chiefs of the Crusade. The
former, who, both il concerting and in con-
ducting this enterprise, kept their eye Readily
fixed on what might be most for the emolument
of their commerce, secured the territories of
greatest value to a trading people. They ob-
tained some part of the Peloponnefus, at that
time the feat of flourifling manufactures, par-
ticularly of silk. They became malters of
fevcral of the largest and best cultivated islands
in the Archipelago, and eftablifled a chain
of fittlcments, partly military and partly com-
Inercial, extending from the Adriatic to the

Bolfpho.

1i. itantinople, and without obstruction from their

warlike aflociates, little attentive to the arts
of induilry, they engrossed the various branches
of trade which had ol long enriched that capital.
Two of there particularly attraced their atten-
tion; the silk trade, and that with India. From
the reign of Jultinian, it was moitly in Greece,
and tome of the adjacent islands, that silk-
vworns, which he first introduced into Europe,
were reared. The product of their labours
was manufacured into stuffs of various kinds
in many cities of the empire. But it was in
Constantinople, the feat of opulence and luxury,
that the demand for a commodity of such high
price was greatest, and there, of confuquence,
thi commerce of silk naturally centered. In
anortinl cargoes for the several ports in
\which they tiaded, the Venetians had for tome
time found silk to be an essential article, as it
continued to grow more and more into requeit
in every part of Europe. By the residence
of so many of their citizens in Conltanlinople,
and b)y llh immunities granted to them, they
iiot only procuicd silk in such abundance, and

on

on such terms, as enabled them to carry on s E c T.
trade more extensively, and with greater profit Il.
than formerly, but they became so thoroughly
acquainted with every branch of the silk manu-
facture, as induced them to attempt the efta-
blifhment of it in their own dominions. The
measures taken for this purpose by individuals,
as well as the regulations framed by the state,
were concerted with so much prudence, and
executed with such success, that in a short time
the silk fabrics of Venice vied with those of
Greece and Sicily, and contributed both to
enrich the republic, and to enlarge the sphere
of its commerce. At the fame time, the Ve-
netians availed themselves of the influence which
they had acquired in Constantinople, in order
to improve their Indian trade. The capital
of the Greek empire, betides the means of
being supplied with the productions of the
East, which it enjoyed in common with the
other commercial cities of Europe, received
a considerable portion of them by a channel
peculiar to itself. Some of the most valu-
able commodities of India and China were
conveyed over land, by routes which I have
delcribed, to the Black Sea, and thence by a
filort navigation to ConfLantinople. To this
inmrkct, tile best itored of any except Alex-
andria, the Venetians had now easy access, and
'he goods lwhich they purchased there, made

12 11al

s E c T. an addition of great consequence to what they

in. were accufiomed to acquire in the ports of
.-w.. EEgypt and Syria. Thus while the Latin empire

in Confiantinople fubfilted, the Venetians pof.
fefied such advantages over all their rivals,
that their commeice extended greatly, and it was
chiefly from them every part of Europe received
the commodities of the Lalt.

Tl-E other event which I had in view, was

the subversion of the dominion of the Latins in
Constantinople, and the re-establishment of the
Imperial family on the throne. This was es-
sected after a period of fifty-feven years, partly
by a transient effort of vigour, with which
indignation at a foreign yoke animated the
Greeks, and partly by the powerful affiltance
which they received from the republic of Genoa.
The Genoese were so sensible of the advantages
which the Venetians, their rivals in trade, de.
rived from their union with the Latin empe-
rors of Conitantinoplc, that, in order to deprive
them of these, they) surmounted the most deep-
rooted prejudices of their age, and combined
uwith the schismatic Greeks to dethrone a mo-
narch protected by the Papal power, setting at
defiance the thunders of the Vatican, which at
that tiliC made the greatest princes tremble.
This undertaking, bold and impious as it was
then dccnmed, proved successful. In rccom-

9 pence

pence for their signal services, the grati- s E c T.
tude or weakness of the Greek emperor, m.I
among other donations, bellowed upon the
Genoese Pera, the chief suburb of Conftantino-
ple, to be held as a fief of the empire, toge-
ther with such exemption from the accustomed
duties on goods imported and exported, as
gave them a decided superiority over every
competitor in trade. With the vigilant atten-
tion of merchants, the Genoese availed them-
fclvcs of this favourable situation. They fur-
rounded their new settlement in Pera with
fortifications. They rendered their factories on
the adjacent coast places of ftrengthc. They
were matters of the harbour of Conifantinople
more than the Greeks themselves. The whole
trade of the Black Sea came into their hands;
and not satisfied with this, they took poffefion
of part of the Cherfonefus Taurica, the mo-
dernCrimasa, and rendered Cafia, its principal
town, the chief feat of their trade with the
Eafl, and the port in which all its produ&ions,
conveyed to the Black Sea by the different
routes I have formerly described, were landed d

rope; and if the enterprising industry and in-
trepid courage of its citizens had been under
the diretion of wife domestic policy, it might
have long held that rank. But never was there
a contrail more striking, than between the in-
ternal administration of the two rival republics
of Venice and Genoa. In the former, govern-
ment was conduced with fleady systematic
prudence; in the latter, it was consistent in
nothing but a fondness for novelty, and a pro-
penfity to change. The one enjoyed a perpe-
tual calm, the other was agitated with all the
florms and viciflitudes of facion. The increase
of wealth, which flowed into Genoa from the
exertions of its merchants, did not counterba-
lance the defeets in its political conititution;
and even in its most prosperous state we may
discern the appearance of symptoms which
foreboded a diminution of its opulence and
power.

As long, however, as the Gcnoefe retained

the ascendant which they had acquired in the
Greek empire, the Venctians felt their com-
mercial tranfjctions with it to be carried on
upon ilchl unequal terms, that their merchants
visited Constantinople fcldom, and with reluc-

tance;

tance; and in order to procure the commodities s. c T.
of the Eait in such quantities as were demanded 1I-
in the various parts of Europe which they were
accustomed to supply,. they were obliged to re-
fort to the ancient staples of that trade. Of these
Alexandria was the chief, and the moil abun-
dantly supplied, as the conveyance of Indian
goods by land through Asia, to any of the ports
of the Mediterranean, was often rendered im-
pralicable by the incursions of Turks, Tartars,
and other hordes, which fuccefively desolated
that fertile country, or contended for the domi-
nion of it. But under the military and vigorous
government of the Soldans of the Mameluks, fe-
curity and order were steadily maintained in
Egypt, and trade, though loaded with heavy
duties, was open to all. In proportion to the
progress of the Genoese in engrossing the com-
merce of ConfRantinople and the Black Sea',
the Venetians found it more and more necessary
to enlarge their tranfaaions with Alexandria.

BuTr such an avowed intercourse with

infidels being confidered, in that age, as
unbecoming the character of Christians, the
Iclate of Venice, in order to silence its own

nlcuplcs, or those of its fubjeds, had recourse

out annually a specified number of ships for

this fandion, the republic concluded a treaty
of commerce with the Soldans of Egypt, on
equitable terms; in consequence of which the
senate appointed one consul to reside in Alex-
andria, and another in Damascus, in a public
charader, and to exercise a mercantile jurif-
dicion, authorised by the Soldans. Under
their proteaion, Venetian merchants and ar.
tifans fettled in each of these cities. Ancient
prejudices and antipathies were forgotten, and
their mutual interelfs established, for the first

were so favourable to its ,progress, that the 1'
state advanced .rapidly in power, and the people
in opulence. But as the Florentines did not
possess any commodious fea-poTt, their active
exertions were dire&ed chiefly towards the
improvement of their manufacures, and do-
meftic induatry. About the beginning of the
fourteenth century, the Florentine manufactures
of various kinds, particularly those of silk and
woollen cloth, appear from the enumeration of
.a well-informed iHiftorian, to -have been very
considerable b. The connecion which they
formed in different parts of Europe, by fur-
nifhing them with the produtions of their own
indufiry, led them to engage in another branch
of trade, that :of.banking. In this they soon
became so eminent, that the money-tranfations
of almost every kingdom in Europe passed
through their hands, and in many of them they
were entrusted with the collection and admini-
ftration of the public revenues. In consequence
of the activity and success with which they con-
duced their manufactures and money-tranf-

endeavoured to procure for his country a share s E c T.
in that lucrative commerce, which had raised II
Venice and Genoa so far above all the other "
Italian flates. With this view ambassadors A. C. 425.
were sent to Alexandria, in order to prevail
with the Soldan to open that and the other
ports of his dominions, to the uibjests of the
republic, and to admit them to a participation
of all the commercial privileges which were
enjoyed by the Venetians. The negociation
terminated with such success, that the Floren-
tines seem to have obtained some share in the
Indian trade'; and soon after this period, we
find spices enumerated among the commodities
imported by the Florentines into England m.

IN some parts of this Disquisition, concern-

ing the nature and course of trade with the
Eafl, I have been obliged to grope my way,
and often under the guidance of very feeble
lights. But as we are now approaching to the
period when the moderh ideas, with refpea to
the importance of commerce, began to unfold,
and attention to its progress and effects became
a more considerable object of policy, we may
hope to carry on what researches yet remain
to be made, with greater certainty and pre-
cifion. To this growing attention we are in-

s E C T. debted for the account which Marino Sanudo,

"II* a Venetian nQbleman, gives of the Indian trade,
^"y as carried on by his countrymen, about the

beginning of the fourteenth century. They
were supplied, as he informs us, with the pro-
dutions of the Eart in two different ways.
Those of small bulk and high value, such as
cloves, nutmegs, mace, gems, pearls, &c.
were conveyed from the Persian gulf up the
Tigris to Baflora, and thence to Bagdat, from
which they were carried to some port on the
Mediterranean. All more bulky goods, such
as pepper, ginger, cinnamon, &c. together
with some portion of the more valuable ar-
ticles, were conveyed by the ancient route
to the Red Sea, and thence across the defart,
and down the Nile, to Alexandria. The goods
received by the former route were, as Sanudo
observes, of superior quality, but from the te-
idioufnefs and expence of a distant land-carriage,
the supply was often scanty, nor can he conceal
(though contrary to a favourite project which
he had in view when he wrote the treatise to
which I refer) that, from the slate of the coun-
tries through wljch the caravans pased, this
mode of conveyance was frequently precarious,
and attended with danger".

Ir was in Alexandria only that the Venetians s E c T.

found always a certain and full supply of Indian IIi.
goods; and as these were conveyed thither ''
chiefly by water-carriage, they might have pur-
chased them at a moderate price, if the Soldans
had not imposed upon them duties which
amounted to a third part of their full value.
Under this and every other disadvantage, how.
ever, it was necessary to procure them, as from
many concurring circumstances, particularly a
more extensive intercourse established among the
different nations of Europe, the demand for
them continued to increase greatly during the
fourteenth century. By the irruptions of the
various hoffile tribes of Barbarians, who took
poffeflion of the greater part of Europe, that
powerful bond by which the Romans had
united together all the people of their vast
empire was entirely dissolved, and such dif.
couragement was given to the communication
of one nation with another, as would appear
altogether incredible, if the evidence of it refted
only upon the teltimony of hiflorians, and were
not confirmed 4y what is still more authentic,

the time of the Crusades, which first brought
people hardly known to one another, to as-
fociate, and to aft in concert during two cen-
turies, in pursuit of one common end, scveral
circumstances had co-operated towards acce-
lerating this general intercourse. The people
around the Baltic, hitherto dreaded and abhorred
by the reft of Europe as pirates and invaders,
assumed more pacific manners, and began now
to visit their neighbours as merchants. Oc-
currences foreign from the fubjeEt of the pre-
sent inquiry, united them together in the
powerful commercial confederacy so famous in
the middle ages, under the name of the Ilan-
featic League, and led them to eftablifl the
staple of their trade with the southern parts of
Europe in Bruges. Thither the merchants of
Italy, particularly those of Venice, retorted;
and in return for the productions of the East,
and the manufactures of their own country,
they received not only the naval stores and
other commodities of the North, but a con-
fiderable supply of gold and silver from the
mines in various provinces of Germany, the

mno0(t

most valuable and productive of any known at s E C T.
that time in Europe P. Bruges continued to be M'.
the great mart or fRorehoufe of European trade -
during the period to which my inquiries extend.
A regular communication, formerly unknown,
was kept up there among all the kingdoms into
which our continent is divided, and we are
enabled to account for the rapid progress of
the Italian flates in wealth and power, by ob-
lerving how much their trade, the source from
which both were derived, muff have augmented
upon the vast increase in the consumption of
Asiatic goods, when all the extensive countries
towards the north-east of Europe were opened
for their reception,

DURING this prosperous and improving slate
of Indian commerce, Venice received from one
of its citizens such new information concern-
ing the countries which produced the precious
commodities that formed the' most valuable
article of its trade, as gave an idea of their
opulence, their population, and their extent,
which rose far above all the former conceptions
of Europeans. From the time that the Ma-
homedans became mailers of Egypt, as no

ount of India by Cofnas Indico-pleuftes in
the iixth century, is, as far as I know, the
Jail which the nations of the Weft received
from any person who had visited that country.
But about the middle of the thirteenth century,
the spirit of commerce, now become more en-
terprifing, and more eager to dilcover new
routes which led to wealth, induced Marco Polo,
a Venetian of a noble family, after trading for
tome time in many of the opulent cities of
the Lesser Asia, to penetrate into the more
eastern parts of that continent, as far as to the
court of the Great Khan on the frontier of
China. During the course of twenty-fix years,
partly employed in mercantile tranfadions, and
partly in conducting negociations with which
the Great Khan entrusted him, he explored
many regions of the East which no European
had ever visited.

He visited different parts of Indoftan, and is ' '
the firlf who mentions Bengal and Guzzerat,

kingdoms. Besides what he difcoyered in his
journies by land, he made more than one voy-
age in the Indian ocean, and acquired some
information concerning an island which he
calls Zipangri or Cipango, probably Japan.
He visited in person Java, Sumatra, and several
islands contiguous to them, the island of Ceylon,
and the coast of Malabar as far as the Gulf
of Cambay, to all which he gives the names
that they now bear. This was the rnoft ex-
tensive survey hitherto made of the East, and
the most complete description of it ever given
by any European; and, in an age which bad
hardly any knowledge of those regions but
what was derived from the geography of Pto-

ple of Europe, were altonifhed at the discovery

and tile cftablifhing the feat of the Turkifli

the Gcnoel'e residing in Pera, involved in the
general calamity, were obliged not only to
abandon that settlement, but all those which
they had made on the adjacent sea-coast, after
they had been in their poffefion near two cen-
turies. Not long after, the vicorious arms of
A I. 1474. the Sultan expelled them from Cafla, and

every other place which they held in the Cri.

open to the nations of the Weft for Indian com-
inodities, and no supply of them could now
be obtained but in Egypt and the ports of
Syria, fulbjcec to the Soldans of the Mameluks.
The Venetians, in consequence of the pro-

tefeton and privileges which they had secured s E.C T.
by their commercial treaty with those powerful Il.
princes, carried on trade in every part of their -
dominions with such advantage, as gave them
a superiority over every competitor. Genoa,
which had long been their most formidable
rival, humbled by the loss of its possessions in
the East, and weakened by domestic dissensions,
leclined Ib fast, that it was obliged to court
foreign protection, and submitted alternately
to the dominion of the Dukes of Milan and
the Kings of France. In consequence of this
diminution of their political power, the com-
mercial exertions of the G,;noefe became less
rigorous. A feeble attempt which they made
to recover that mhare of the Indian trade which
they had formerly enjoyed, by offering to enter
into treaty with the Soldans of Egypt upon
tcrms similar to those which had been granted
to the Venetians, proved unsuccessful; and
luring the remainder of the fifteenth century,
Venice supplied the greater part of Europe with
the produaions of the Elaft, and carried on
Iridc to an extent far beyond what had been
known in tholc times.

progress

S E C T. progress of the Venetians. England, ddfolated

nm. by the civil wars which the unhappy contest

between the houses of York and LancaRfer
excited, had hardly begun to turn its atteidtion
towards those objeEs and pursuits to which it is
indebted for its present opulence and power.
In France, the fatal effects of the English arms
and conquests were still felt, and the king had
neither acquired power, nor the people inclina.
tion, to direct the national genius and acivity
to the arts of peace. The union of the dif.
ferent kingdoms of Spain was not yet com.
pleted; some of its most fertile provinces
were still under the dominion of the Moors,
with whoin the Spanish monarchs waged per-
petual war; and, except by the Catalans, little
attentionwas paid to foreign trade. Portugal,
though it had already entered upon that career
of discovery which terminated with most splendid
success, had not yet made such progress in it
as to be entitled to any high rank among
the commercial flates of Europe. Thus the
Venetians, almost without rival or competitor,
except from some of the inferior Italian states, were
left at liberty to concert and to execute their
mercantile plans; and their trade with the
cities of the Hanseatic League, which unitedhthe
North and South of Europe, and which hitherto

had

had been common to all the Italianis, was now S E C T.
engrossed, in a great measure, by them alone. ii.

WHILE the increasing demand for the pro-

duEtions of Asia induced all the people of Eu-
rope to court intercourse with the Venetians
so eagerly, as to allure them, by various im-
munities, to frequent their sea-ports, we may
observe a peculiarity in their mode of carrying
on trade with the East, which distinguishes
it from what has taken place in other coun-
tries in any period of history. In the ancient
world, the Tyrians, the Greeks who were maf-
ters of Egypt, and the Romans, failed to India
in quest of those commodities with which they
supplied the people of the Weft. In modern
times, the fame has been the pra&ice of the
Portuguese, the Dutch, the English, and, after
their example, of other European nations.
In both periods loud complaints have been
made, that in carrying on this trade every state
muff be drained of the precious metals, which,
in the course of it flow incessantly from the
Weft to the Eift, never to return. From
whatever loss might have been occasioned
by this gradual but unavoidable diminution
of their gold and silver, (whether a real
or only an imaginary loss, it is not incum-
bent upon me in tlhis place to inquire or to
dermlninc,) tihe Vchetians were, in a great

mcafure,

s L c T. measure, exempted. They had no dire cin

Il'l tercourfe with India. They found in Egypt,

or in Syria, warehouses filled with all the coin.
modities of the East, imported by the Ma.
homedans; and from the belt accounts we
have, with refpce to the nature of their trade,
they purchased them more frequently by barter,
than with ready money. Egypt, the chief mart
for Indian goods, though a moil fertile coun-
try, is deititute of many things requisite in an
improved slate of society, either for accom-
modation or for ornament. Too limited in
extent, and too highly cultivated to afford space
for forests ; too level to have mines of the useful
metals; it must be supplied with timber for
building, with iron, lead, tin, and brass, by im.
portation from other countries. The Egyptians,
while under the dominion of the Mameluks,
icem not themselves to have traded in the ports
of any Christian state, and it was principally
from the Venetians, that they received all the
articles which I have enumerated. Besides these,
the ingenuity of the Venetian artists furnifled a
variety of manufactures of woollen cloths, silk
fluffs of various fabric, camblets, mirrors, arms,
ornaments of gold and silver, glass, and many
other articles, for all which they found a ready
market in Egypt and Syria. In return they re.
ceived from the merchants of Alexandria, spices
of every kind, drugs, gems, pearls, ivory, cotton

14 and

in many ,d4ierent fornms, au1 other pmiaduEdons .sI.
.of the Zaft, together w.ith several. valuab
articles ,fs Egyptian growth at ;fEbric. tb
Aleppo, Baruth, and other cities, Jefides :the
proper teoijrnodities of India brought thither
.by land, they iadded to their cargoes the carpets
of Persia, the -riQh wrought silks of Damafpus,
fRill known by a name taken from that -city,
and various produEions of art and nature pe-
culiar to Syria, Palestine, and Arabia. If, at
any time, their demand for the produQEions
.of the East went beyond what they could pro-
cure in .exchange for their own maoufadtlres,
that trade with the cities of the Hanseatic League,
which I have mentioned, furnished them from
the mines of Germany, with a regular supply
of gold and silver, which.they could carry, with
*advantage, ito the markets of Egypt and Syria.

FROM a !propensity, remarkable in all com-

mercial iates,. to -fwbjec the operations of trade
.to political ,egiutation and reftrairit, the autho-
rity of the Venetian govarnient seems to have
been interposed .both in direEting the import-
ation of Asiatic goods, and 1i the mode of cir-
culating them ambng the different nations of
Europe. To every considerable staple in the
MIediterranean a certain number of large vessels,

M known

s E c T. known by the name of Gdleons or Caracks, was

nI. fitted out on the public account, and returned

- loaded with the richest nerchandife , the

profit atifing from the sale of which must have
been no fender addition to the revenue of the
republic. Citizens, however, of every class,
particularly persons of noble families, were en.
couraged to engage in foreign trade, and who.
ever employed a vessel of a certain burden for
this purpose, received a considerable bounty
from the itate '. It was in the fame manner,
partly in ships belonging to the public, and
partly in those of private traders, that the Ve.
netians circulated through Europe the goods
imported from the East, as well as the produce
of their own dominions and manufaaures.

THERE are two different ways by which w

may come at some knowledge of the mag-
nitude of those branches of commerce carried
on by the Venetians. The one, by attending
to the great variety and high value of the co0m
modities which they imported into Bruges, the
fore-houfe from which the nore northern nations
of Europe were supplied. A full enumeration

of these is given by a well-informed author, s E C T.
in which is contained almoit every article I
deemed in that age essential to accommodation
or to elegance . The other, by confidering
the effecs of the Venetian trade upon the cities
admitted to a participation of its advantages.
Never did wealth appear more conspicuously
in the train of commerce. The citizens of
Bruges, enriched by it, displayed in their dress,
their buildings, and mode of living, such magni-
ficence as even to mortify the pride and excite
the envy of royalty z. Antwerp, when the
flaple was removed thither, soon rivalled Bruges
in opulence and splendour. In some cities of
Germany, particularly in Augsburg, the great
mart for Indian commodities in the interior
parts of that extensive country, we meet with
early examples of such large fortunes accumu-
lated by mercantile industry, as raised the pro.
prietors of them to high rank and consideration
in the empire.

FROM observing this remarkable increase of

opulence in all the places where the Vene-
tians had an established trade, we are led to
conclude, that the profit accruing to themselves

M from

s E c T. from the different branches of it; efpecialIy that

Jll with the East, must have been still more con.
* I~fiderable. It is inmofi.hle, however, without

information much more minute than that to
which we have 'access, to form an estimate of
this with accuracy; but various circumstances
may be produced to establish, in general, the
justness of this conclusion. From the first re.
vival of a commercial spirit in Europe, the
Venetians .poieffed a large share of the trae
with the .aft. It continued gradually to in.
crease, and during a great part of the fifteenth
century, they had nearly a monopoly of it.
This was produEtive of consequences attending
-all monopolies. Wherever there is no compe-
tition, and the merchant has it in his power
:to regulate the market, and to fix the price of
-the commodities which he vends, his gains
*will be exorbitant. Some idea of their magni.
.tude, during several centuries, may be formed
by attending to the rate of the- pr.emium or
interest then paid for the ufc of money. This
.is undoubtedly the moet exact standard :by which
-to measure the profit a:ifing from the capital
flock employed in commerce; for, aceording
~as the interest of money is high or low, the
gain acquired by the use of it muff vary, and
become exceflive or moderate. Fromn the close
ot the clceventh century to the conmmenicecie

0

of the sixteenth, the period during which the s E C T
Italians made their chief conmmercial exertions, Itt
the rate of interest was extremely high. It
was usually twenty per cent. sometimes above
that; and so late as the year one thousand five
hundred, it had not funk below ten or twvlve
per cent. in any part of Europe a. If the profits
of a trade so extensive as' that of the Venetians
corresponded to this high value of money, it
could not fail of proving a source of great
wealth, both public and privateb. The cons
dition of Venice, accordingly, during the period
under review, is described by writers of that
age, in terms which are not applicable to that
of any other country in Europe. The revenues
of the republic, as well as the wealth amafed by
individuals, exceeded whatever was elsewhere
known. In the magrifficence of their houses,
in richneit of furniture, in profusion of plate,
and in every thing which contributed either
towards elegance or parade iri their mode of
living, the nobles of Venice surpassed the state
of the greatest monarchs beyond the Alps.. Nor
was all this display the effect of an odtentatious
and inconsiderate dissipation,, it was the natural
consequence of successful induflry, which, having

a iii. of Clharles V. vol. i. p. 401, &c.

s E c r. accumulated wealth with ease, is entitled to enjoy

II. it in splendour c.

NEVER did the Venetians believe the power

of their country to be more firmly eftablilhed,
or rely with greater confidence on the con.
tinuance and increase of its opulence, than to,
wards the close of the fifteenth century, when
two events (which they could neither foresee

oQr prevent) happened, that proved fatal to
both. The one was the discovery of America,
The other was the opening a direct course of
navigation to the East Indies, by the Cape
of Good Hope. Of all occurrences in the
hitiory of the human race, these are undoubtedly
among the most interefling; and as they oc.
cafioned a remarkable change of intercourse
among the different quarters of the globe, and
finally established those commercial ideas and
arrangements which constitute the chief dif.
tin&ion between the manners and policy of
ancient and of modern times, an account of
them is intimately connected with the subjet
of this Disquisition, and will bring it to that
period which I have fixed upon for its boundary.
But as I have related the rife and progress of

quifite in this place. II.

THE admiration or envy with which the other

nations of Europe beheld the power and wealth
of Venice, led them naturally to enquire into
the causes of this pre-eminence; and among
these, its lucrative commerce with the East
appeared to be by far the moil considerable.
Mortified with being excluded from a source of
opulence, which to the Venetians had proved
so abundant, different countries had attempted
to acquire a share of the Indian trade. Some
of the Italian states endeavoured to obtain ad.
mission into the ports of Egypt and Syria, upon
the fame terms with the Venetians; but either.
by the superior interest of the Venetians in the:
court of the Soldans, their. negociations for, that
purpose were rendered unsuccessful ? or from the'
manifold advantages which merchants, long in
possession of any branch of trade, have in a codm
petition with new adventurers, all their exertions
did not produce effeas of any consequence.
In other countries, various schemes were formed
with the fame view. As early as the year one,

AFTER several unficcefsful attenpts: to ac.

complih .what they had in view,; a frnall squadron
failed from. the Tagus, under the conmmand of
Vasco de Gama, an officer of rank, whose
abilities and courage fitted him to-condut the
most difficult and arduous enterprises. From
unacquaintance, however, with the proper season
mad route of navigation in that vast ocean through
which he had to {leer his course, his voyage
was long and dangerous. At length he doubled
that promontory, which, for several years, had

been

been. the object of terror and of hope to his s E c T.
countrymen. From that, after a prosperous m.
navigation along the south-east of Africa, he
arrived at the city of Melinda, and had the
fatisfadion of discovering there, as well as at
other places where he touched, people of a
race very different from the rude inhabitants
of the Western shore of that continent, which
alone the Portuguese had hitherto visited.
These he found to be so far advanced in civiliz-
ation, and acquaintance with the various arts
of life, that they carried on an adtive commerce,
not only with the nations on their own coast,
but with remote countries of Asia. Conducted
by their pilots, who held a course (with which
experience had rendered them well acquainted)
he failed across -the Indian ocean, and landed
at Calecut, on the coast of Malabar on the
twenty-fecond of May, one thousand four hun-
dred and ninety-eight, ten months and two days
after his departure from the port of Liibon.

THE Samorin, or Monarch of the country,

astonished at this unexpeced. visit of an un-
known people, whose aspect, and arms, and
manners, bore no resemblance to any of the
nations accustomed to frequent his harbours,
and who arrived in his dominions by a route

as if he had been inspired with foresight :of
all: the calamities now approaching India by
this fatal communication opened with the in.
habitants of Europe, he formed various:
schemes to cut off Gama and his 'follow-
ers. But from every danger to which he
was.expofed, either by the open attacks or
lecret machination of the India-rs, the Pertu-
guefe Admiralextricated himself with singular

N\or

Nor did this event interest the Portuguese alone. s E (.:Tr
No nation in Europe beheld it with unconcern. IIm
For althoulgh the discovery of a new world,
whether we view it as a display of genius in
the person who first conceived an idea of that
undertaking which led mankind to the know-
ledge of it, whether we contemplate its in-
fluence upon science by giving a more com-
plete knowledge of the globe which we inhabit,
or whether we confider its effects upon the
commercial intercourse of mankind, be an event
far more splendid than the voyage of Gama,
yet the latter seems originally to have excited
more general attention. The former, indeed,
filled the minds of men with astonishment;
t was some time, however, before they attained
such a fufficiefit knowledge of that portion of
the earth now laid open to their view, as to
form any just idea, or even probable conjeEture,
with refpet to what might be the consequences
of communication with it. But the immense
value of the Indian trade, which both in ancient
and in modern times had enriched every nation
by which it was carried on, was a fubje& fa-
miliar to the thoughts of all intelligent men,
and they at once perceived that the discovery
of this new route of navigation to the Eafl,
muff occasion great revolutions, not only in
the course of commerce, but in the political
state of Europe.

WMTHAT

s C T. WHAT these revolutions were most likely

il. to be, and how they would operate, were points
^-C-' examined with particular attention in the cities

of Lisbon and of Venice, but with feelings
very different. The Portuguese, founding upon
the rights to which, in that age, priority of dif.
covery, confirmed by a papal grant, were sup-
posed to confer, deemed themselves entitled to
an exclusive commerce with the countries which
they had first visited, began to enjoy, by an.
ticipation, all the benefits of it, and to fancy
that their capital would soon be what Venice
then was, the great store-house of Eastern corn.
modities to all Europe, and the feat of opulence
and power. On the first intelligence of Gama's
successful voyage, the Venetians, with the quick,
righted discernment of merchants, foresaw the
immediate consequence of it to be the ruin of
that lucrative branch of commerce which had
contributed so greatly to enrich and aggrandize
their country; and they observed this with more
poignant concern, as they were apprehensive
that they did not possess any effe&ual means of
preventing, or even retarding, its operation.

TIE hopes and fears of both were well

founded. The. Portuguese entered upon the
new career opened to thein with activity and
ardour, and made exertions, both commercial
and military, far beyond what could have been

expeAced

expe&ted from a kingdom of such inconsiderable s E c T.
extent. All these were direced by an intelligent II*
monarch, capable of forming plans of the " -
greatest magnitude with calm systematic wis-
dom, and of prosecuting them with unremitting
perseverance. The prudence and vigour of
his measures, however, would have availed little
without proper instruments to carry them into
execution. Happily for Portugal, the discerning
eye of Emanuel feleeed a succession of officers
to take the supreme command in India, who,
by their enterprising valour, military ikill, and
political sagacity, accompanied with difinterefled
integrity, public spirit, and love of their coun-
try, have a title to be ranked with the persons
tnoft eminent for virtue and abilities in any
age or nation.- Greater things perhaps were
atchieved by them, than were ever accomplifled
in so short a time. Before the close of Emanuel's
reign, twenty-four years only after the voyage
of Gama, the Portuguese had rendered them-
selves makfers of the city of Malacca, in which
the great staple of trade carried on among the
inhabitants of all those regions in Asia, which
Europeans have distinguished by the general
name of the Eaft-Indies, was then established.

they were enabled to engross the trade of the

eflabliffied intercourse of Egypt with India by
the. led Sea. Their thips frequented every
port in the East where valuable commodities
were to be found, from the Cape of Good
.Hope to the river of Canton; and along this
immense stretch of coast, extending upwards
of four thousand leagues h, they had f4tblithed,
.for the conveniency or protetion of :trade, a
chain of forts or fa&cories. They had likewise
taken possession of stations Dioft favouwable to
commerce along the Southern coast of Africa,
and in many of the islands which lie .between
Madagascar and the Moluccas. In iwery paut

of

of the Eafi they were received with refpet, s E C T.
in many they had acquired the absolute corn- m.
mand. They carried on trade there without '...
rival or controul; they prescribed to the natives
the terms of their mutual intercourse; they often
set what price they pleated on goods which
they purchased; and were thus enabled to im-
port from Indoftan and the regions beyond it,
whatever is useful, rare, or agreeable, in greater
abundance, and of nrore various kinds, than
had been known formerly in Europe.

NOT satisfied with this ascendant which they

had acquired in India, the Portuguese early
formed a scheme, no less bold than interested,
of excluding all other nations from participating
of the advantages of commerce with the East.
In order to assec this, it was necessary to obtain
poffeflion of such stations in the Arabian and
Persian Gulfs, as might render them mailers
of the navigation of there two inland seas, and
enable them both to obftruat the ancient com-
mercial intercourse between Egypt and India,
and to command the entrance of the great rivers,
which facilitated the conveyance of Indian
goods, not only through the interior provinces
of Aria, but as far as Conflantirople. The
conduCt of the meaftures for this purpose was
committed to Alphonfo Albuquerque, the most

N Ieminent

S E C T. eminent of all the Pottuguefe generals who dif.

tlI. tinguilhed theiifelves in India. After the
'e~ utmost efforts of genius and valour, he was

able to accomplifl one-half only of what the
ambition of his countrymen had planned. By
wresting the island of Ormuz, which commanded
the mouth of the Persian Gulf, from the petty
princes, who, as tributaries to the monarchs of
Persia, had established their dominion there,
he secured to Portugal that extensive trade
with the East, which the Persians had carried on
for several centuries. In the hands of the Poi-
tuguefe, Ormuz soon became the great mart
from which the Persian empire, and all the
provinces of Asia to the welt of it, were supplied
with the productions of India; and a city which
they built on that barren island, destitute of
water, was rendered one of the chief feats of
opulence, splendour, and luxury in the Eastern
world'.

THE operations of Albuquerque in the Red Sea

were far from being attended with equal success.
Partly by the vigorous resistance of the Arabian
princes, whose ports he attacked, and partly
by the damage his fleet sustained in a Tea of

which

which the navigation is remarkably difficult s E e T.
and dangerous, he was conitrained to retire, Il.
without effecting any settlement of importance '- -.
The ancient channel of intercourse with India by
the Red Sea still continued open to the Egyptians;
but their commercial tranfaaions in that coun-
try were greatly circumscribed and obftruEted,
by the influence which the Portuguese had ac-
quired in every port to which they were accuf-
tomed to resort,

IN consequence of this, the Venetians loon

began to feel that decrease of their own Indian
trade which they had foreseen and dreaded.
In order to prevent the farther progress of this
evil, they persuaded the Soldan of the Mame-
luks, equally alarmed with themselves at the
rapid success of the Portuguese in the East,
and no less interefled to hinder them from
engrossing that commerce, which had so long
been the chief source of opulence both to the
monarchs and to the people of Egypt, to enter
into a negociation with the Pope and the King
of Portugal. The tone which the Soldan as-
fumed in this negociation was such as became
the fierce chief of a military government,
After lating his exclusive right to the trade

S E C T. with India, he forewarnedJulius II. and-Emanuel,

GE*L that if the Portuguese did not relinquish that

new course of navigation by which they had
penetrated into the Indian ocean, and cease
from encroaching on that commerce, which
from time immemorial had been carried on
between the Eafl of Asia and his dominions,
he would put to death all the Chrifltians in Egypt,
Syria, and Palestine, burn their churches, and
demolish the holy sepulchre itself'. This far-
midable threat, which, during several centuries,
would have made all Christendom tremble,
seems to have made so little impreflion, that
the Venetians, as the last expedient, had re-
course to a measure, which, in that age, was
deemed not only reprehenfibe but impious.
They incited the Soldan to fit out a fleet in the
Red Sea, and to attack those unexpected in-
vaders of a gainful monopoly, of which he and
his predeceflbrs had long enjoyed undisturbed
poffeffon. As Egypt did not produce timber
proper for building ships of force, the Vene-
tians permitted the Soldan to cut it in their
forests of Dalmatia, whence it was conveyed
to Alexandria, and then carried, partly b)
water and partly by land, to Suez. There

twelve ships of' war were built, on board of s E CT.
which a body of Mameluks was ordered to Lmi.
serve, under the command of an officer of merit.
These new enemies, far more formidable than
the natives of India with whom the Portu-
guefe had hitherto contended, they encountered,
with undaunted courage, and after some conflicts,
they entirely ruined the squadron, and remained
maftcrs of the Indian ocean m.

SOON after this disaster, the dominion of the

Namreluks was overturned, and Egypt, Syria,
and Palestine were fubjeaed to the Turkish
empire by the victorious arms of Selim I. Their
mutual interest quickly induced the Turks and
Venetians to forget ancient animotities, and to
co-operate towards the ruin of the Portuguese
trade in India. With this view Selim con-
firmed to the Venetians the extensive commer-
cial privileges which they had enjoyed under
the government of the Mameluks, and pub.
lithed an edit permitting the free entry of all
the produtions of the East, imported diretly
from Alexandria, into every part of his do-
minions, and imposing heavy duties upon such
as were brought from Lisbon ",

N 3 BUT

s E c T. BUT all these were unavailing efforts against the

II. superior advantages which the Portuguese pof-

sessed in supplying Europe with the commodi-
ties of the East, in consequence of having
opened a new mode of communication with
it. At the fame time, the Venetians, brought
to the brink of ruin by the fatal league of
Cambray, which broke the power and humbled
the pride of the republic, were incapable of
such eflorts for the preservation of their coim-
merce, as they might have made in the more
vigorous age of their government, and were
reduced to the feeble expedients of a declining
slate. Of this there is a remarkable inifance
in an offer made by them to the King of Por-
tugal in the year one thousand five hundred
and twenty-one, to purchase, at a stipulated
price, all the spices imported into Lisbon, over
and above what might be requisite for the con-
fumption of his own fubjeas. If Emanuel
had been so inconsiderate as to close with this
proposal, Venice would have recovered all the
benefit of the gainful monopoly which she had
loft. But the offer met with the reception that
it merited, and was rejected without hesitation °.

THE Portuguese, almost without obflruc-
tion, continued their progress in the East, until

o Otor. dc rcb. Eman. lib. xii. 265.

they

they established there a commercial empire; s c T.
to which, whether we confider its extent, its II.
opulence, the slender power by which it was
formed, or the splendour with which the go-
vernment of it was conducted, there had hi-
therto been nothing comparable in the history
of nations. Emanuel, who laid the foundation
of this stupendous fabric, had the fatisfaaion
to fee it almost completed. Every part of
Europe was supplied by the Portuguese with
the produtions of the East; and if we except
some inconsiderable quantity of them, which
the Venetians fill continued to receive by the
ancient channels of conveyance, our quarter of
the globe had no longer any commercial inter-
course with India, and the regions of Asia beyond
it, but by the Cape of Good Hope.

THOUGH from this period the people of

Europe have continued to carry on their trade
with India by sea, yet a considerable portion
of the valuable produtions of the East is frill
conveyed to other regions of the earth by land-
carriage. In tracing the progress of trade with
India, this branch of it is an objeA of con-
fiderable magnitude, which has not been ex-
amiined with sufficient attention. That the
ancients should have had recourse frequently
to the tedious and expensive mode of transporting

N 4 goods

s EC T. goods by land, will not appear surprising,

uII. when we recolleE the imperfeEt tate of na-

vigation among them: The reason of this mode
of conveyance being not only continued, but
increased, in modern times, demands some ex.
planation.

IF we infpet a map of Asia, we cannot fail

to observe, that the communication throughout
all the countries of that great continent to the
weft of Indoftan and China, though opened in
ibme degree towards the south by the naviga-
ble rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, and towards
the north by two inland seas, the Euxine and
Caspian, mufft be carried on in many extensive
provinces wholly by land. This, as I have
observed, was the firlt mode of intercourse
between different countries, and during the
infancy of navigation it was the only one. Even
-4fter that art had attained some degree of im-
provement, the conveyance of goods by the
two rivers formerly mentioned, extended so
little way into the interior country, and the
trade of the Euxine and Caspian seas were so
often obltruded by the barbarous nations scat-
tered along their shores, that partly on that
account, and partly from the adherence of man-
kind to ancient habits, the commerce of the
various provinces of Asia, particularly that with

India

India and the regions beyond it, continued to s E C T.
be conduced by land. M1.

TIIE fame circumfrances which induced the

inhabitants of Asia to carry on such a con-
fiderable part of their commerce with each other
in this manner, operated with still more power-
ful effct in Africa. That vast continent, which
little resembles the other divisions of the earth,
is not penetrated with inland seas, like Europe
and Asia, or by a chain of lakes, like North
America, or opened by rivers (the Nile alone
excepted) of extended navigation. It forms
one uniform, continuous surface, between the
various parts of which there could be no inter-
course from the earliest times, but by land. Rude
as all the people of Africa are, and slender as
the progress is which they have made in the
arts ot life, such a communication appears to
have been early opened and always kept up,
How far it extended in the more early periods
to which my researches have been direced, and
by what different routes it was carried" on, I
have not sufficient information to determine
with accuracy. It is highly probable that, from
time immemorial, the gold, the ivory, the per-
fumes, both of the southern parts of Africa,
and of its more northern diltriats, were con-
veyed either to the Arabian Gulf, or to Egypt,

and

s E C T. and exchanged for the spices and other produc,

. tions of the EaR.

THE' Mahomedan religion, which spread with

amazing rapidity over all Asia and a considerable
part of Africa, contributed greatly towards the
increase of commercial intercourse by land in
both these quarters of the globe, and has given
it additional vigour, by mingling with it a new
principle of activity, and by directing it -to
a common centre. Mahomet enjoined all his
followers to visit once in their life-time, the
Caaba, or square building in the temple of Mecca,
the immemorial object of veneration among his
countrymen, not only on account of its having
been chosen (according to their tradition) to be
the residence of man at his creation p, but be-
cause it was the first spot on this earth which
was consecrated to the worship of God 1:
In order to preserve continually upon their
minds a sense of obligation to perform this duty,
he directed that, in all the multiplied ats of
devotion which his religion prescribes, true
believers ihould always turn their faces towards

that

that holy place . In obedience to a precet s E C T.
solemnly enjoined and sedulously inculcated, III
large caravans of pilgrims assemble annually
in every country where the Mahomedan faith
is eftabliffed. From the shores of the Atlantic
on one hand, and from the most remote regions
of the East on the other, the votaries of the
Prophet advance to Mecca. Commercial ideas
and objecs mingle with those of devotion.
The numerous camels of each caravan are
loaded with those commodities of every coun-
try which are of easiest carriage and most ready
sale. The holy city is crowded, not only with
zealous devotees, but with opulent merchants.
During the' few days they remain there,
the fair of Mecca is the greatest, perhaps, on
the face of the earth. Mercantile tranfaEtions
are carried on in it to an immense value, of
which the dispatch, the silence, the mutual
confidence and good faith in conducting them,
are the most unequivocal proof. The pro-
dutions and manufactures of India form a ca-
pital article in this great traffic, and the caravans,
on their return, disseminate them through every
part of Asia and Africa. Some of these are
deemed necessary, not only to the comfort,

so various as to suit the taste of mankind in
every climate, and in different stages of im.
provement; and are in high rcqueft among
the rude natives of Africa, as well as the more
luxurious inhabitants of Asia. In order to
supply their several demands, the caravans return
loaded with the muslins and chintzes of Bengal
and the Deccan, the shawls of Cachemire, the
pepper of Malabar, the diamonds of Golconda,
the pearls of Kilkare, the cinnamon of Ceylon,
the nutmeg, cloves, and mace of the Moluccas,
and ah inmmenfe number of other Indian com-
modities.

BESIDE these great caravans, formed partly

by refped for a religious precept, and partly
with a view to extend a lucrative branch of
commerce, there are other caravans, and these
not inconsiderable, composed entirely of mer-
chants, who have no object but trade. These,
at stated seasons, set out from different parts
of the Turkish and Persian dominions, and
proceeding to Indoftan, and even to China,
by routes which were anciently known, they
convey by land-carriage the moist valuable
commodities of thele countries to the remote pro-
vinces of both empires. It is only by confidering

the

the distance to which large quantities of these s E c T.
commodities are carried, and frequently across mI
extensive deserts, which, without the aid of
camels, would have been impassable, that we
can form.any idea of the magnitude of the trade
with India by land, and are led to perceive,
that in a Disquisition concerning the various
modes of conducting this commerce, it is well
entitled to the attention which I have bestowed
in endeavouring to trace it '.

CONCERNING
ANCIENT INDIA.

SECTION IV.

General ObfJrvations.
S F C T. THUS I have endeavoured to describe the

iv. progress of trade with India, both by sea
'-^rJ and by land, from the earliest times in which

history affords any authentic information con-
cerning it, until an entire revolution was made
in its nature, and the mode of carrying it on,
by that great discovery which I originally fixed
as the utmost boundary of my enquiries. Here,
then, this Disquisition might have been termi-
nated. But as I have conducted my readers to
that period when a new order of ideas, and
new arrangements of policy began to be intro-

duced

duced into Europe, in consequence of the value s E c T.
and importance of commerce being so thoroughly iv.
understood, that in alrmoft every country the '
encouragement of it became a chief objet of
public attention; as we have now reached that
point whence a line may be drawn which marks
the chief diftintion between the manners and
political inffitutions of ancient and modern
times, it will render the work more inftrudtive
and useful, to conclude it with some general
observations, which naturally arise from a fur-
vey of both, and a comparison of the one with
the other. These observations, I trust, will be
found not only to have an intimate conneEtion
with the subjet of my researches, and to throw
additional light upon it; but will serve to
illuflrate many particulars in the general hiffory
of commerce, and to point out effets or con-
sequences of various events, which have not
been generally observed, or confidered with
that attention which they merited.

I. AFT1 E viewing the great and extensive

efleCts of finding a new course of navigation
to India by the Cape of Good Hope, it may
appear surprising to a modern observer, that
a discovery of such importance was not made, or
even attempted, by any of the commercial states
of the ancient world. But in judging with

8 rerpet

s E c T. refpee to the condut of nations in remote times,

Iv. we never err more widely, than when we decide
* '- with regard to it, not according to the ideas

and views of their age, but of our own. This
is not, perhaps, more conspicuous in any in-
fiance, than in that under consideration. It was
by the Tyrians, and by the Greeks, who were
maiters of Egypt, that the different people of
Europe were first supplied with the productions
of theEafi. From the account that has been
given of the manner in which they procured
these, it is manifest that they had neither the
fame inducements with modern nations, to wish
for any new communication with India, nor
the fame means of accomplishing it. All the
commercial tranfations of the ancients with
the East were confined to the ports on the Ma-
labar coast, or extended at farthest to the island
of Ceylon. To there staples, the natives of
all the different regions in the ealtern parts of
Asia brought the commodities which were the
growth of their several countries, or the pro-
duet of their ingenuity, in their own vessels, and
with them the ihips from Tyre and fiom
Egypt completed their investments. While the
operations of their Indian trade were carried
on within a sphere so circumscribed, the con-
veyance of a cargo by the Arabian Gulf, not-
withflanding the expence of land carriage, either

7 from

from Elath to Rhinocolura, br acrofs'the defart s E c T.
to the Nile, was si safe and commodious, Iv.
that the merchants of Tyre and Alexandria '-
had little reason to be solicitous for the dif-
covery of any other. The 'situation of both
these cities, as well as that of the other con-
fiderable commercial states of antiquity, was
very different from that of the countries to
which, in later times, mankind have been in-
debted, for keeping up intercourse with the
remote parts of the globe. Portugal, Spain,
England, Holland, which have been most active
and successful in this line of enterprise, all lie
on the Atlantic ocean, (in which every Eu-
ropean voyage of discovery must commence,)
or have immediate access to it, But Tyre was
situated at the eatern extremity of the Me-
diterranean, Alexandria not far from it; Rhodes,
Athens, Corinth, which came afterwards to be
ranked among the most active trading cities of
antiquity lay considerably advanced towards
the fame quarter iti that sea. The commerce
of all thele states was long confined within
the precinds of the Mediterranean ; and in
some of them, never extended beyond it. The
pillars of Hercules, ot the Straits of Gibraltar,
'ere long confidered as the utmost boundary
"f navigation. 'To reach this was deemed a
1it;al proof of naval flill; and before any of

- which lay beyond it, they had to accomplifl

a voyage (according to their ideas) of great
extent and much danger. This was sufficient
to deter them from engaging in an arduous
undertaking, from which, even if attended with
success, their situation prevented their enter.
taining hopes of deriving great advantage '.

BUT could we suppose the discovery of a

new passage to India to have become an objet
of desire or pursuit to any of these states, their
science as well as practice of navigation was
so defetive, that it would have been hardly
pofible--for them to attain it. The vessels
which the ancients employed in trade were so
small, as not to afford stowage for provisions
sufficient to subsist a crew during a long
voyage. Their conftrudion was such that
they could seldom venture >to depart far
from land, and their mode of fleering along
the coafi (which I have been obliged to
tlention often) so circuitous and flow, that
from these as well as from other circumstances

nounce a voyage' from the Mediterranean to s e T.
India by the Cape of Good Hoped to have IV;
been an undertaking beyond their power to
accomplish, in such a manner as to render it,
in any degrees subservient to commerce. To
this decision, the account preserved by Herodo-
tus, of a voyage performed by some Phenician
ships employed by a king of Egypt, which, tak-
ing their departure from the Arabian Gulf,'
doubled the southern promontory of Africa, and
arrived at the end of three years, by the Straits of
Gades, or. Gibraltar, at the mouth of the Nile c,
can hardly be confidered as repugnant ; for
several writers of the greatest eminence among
the ancients, and most distinguished ;for their
proficiency in the knowledge of geography3
regarded this account rather as an amusing
tale, than the history of a real tranfacion; and
either entertained doubts concerning the pof-
fibility of failing round Africa, or absolutely
denied it 1 But if what Herodotus relates
concerning the course held by these Phenician
hips had ever been received by the ancients
with general assent, we can hardly suppose that
any state could have been so wildly adventurous

their .mode of conduding. naval operations,
and that of. the ancients, -as nierits t b'e :cbn-

the reign of ,the first Ptolemy, to the-conqtiel:

while they verc inaiftdrs of Egypt§ and bythe
lubjetts of the Emperors of Constantinople, when
that kingdomn became a province of their do-
minions;. .During this long, period, extending
almolt to a thoulnmd years,, none of those. peo-
ple, the most enlightened undoubtedly in the
ancient world, ever advanced by sea farther
towards the Eait than the Gulf of Siam, and had
no regular ellablifled trade but with the ports
on the co.af of Malabar, or those in the ifand
of Ceylon. They attempted no conquets in
any part of India, they made no settlements
they credled no forrs. Satisfied with an inter-
rnmrfc mercly coin: crcil, they did not aim at

acquiring

acquiring, any degree of power or dominion in s E C T.
the ,'cou:ntries where-- they traded, though it Iv,
ieems to be probabl - 'that they might have
established it without much oppoition from
the natives', a gentle effeminate' people,: with
whom, at (that time, no foreign and more war-
like- races was mingled. But the enterprising
adtivity ofthe Portuguese was tnot long confined
withivfthe fame limits ; a few years after'tlieir
arri4al :aitCalecut, they advanced towards the
East, itito regions unknown to: tlie ancients.
The kingdoms of Cambodia, Cochin China,
'onqu'iri, the vast empire of China, and all the
fertile islands in the great Indian Archipelago,
from Sumatra to the Philippines, were dif-
covered, and the.Portuguefe, though opposed
in every quarter by the Mahoinedans of Tartar
or Arabian origin fettled in many parts of India,
enemies much more formidable than the natives,
eflablifhed there that extensive influence and do-
minion iwhich I have formerly described.

OF this remarkable difference between the

progress andl operations of the ancients and
moderns in India, the iiiperfect knowledge of
the formne, :with refpeC both to the theory
and pracice of navigation, seems to have been
the principal caufc. F;tom the coast of Malabar
to the Philippines, was a voyage of an extent

o 3 far

S E C T. far beyond 'any that the ancients were,! .Gi.f

iv. tomed to undertake, ad, according to .thei
UJ-,.. manner of failing, must have required a grat

length of time to perform it. The nat e OQf,
tlier trade with India was such, that t4heyrha4
not (as has. been formerly observed) :the. ,ani,
inducements with the inoderns, to pT-fcute,
discovery with ardour; and, according. to the
description given. of the vessels in which' the
mierchants of Alexandria carried on their trade
from -th¢ Arabian Gulf, they appear to have
been very unfit for that pu'pofe. On all these
accounts, the ancients remained satisfied with
a slender knowledge of India; and influenced
by reasons proceeding fronm the. fame cause,
they attempted neither conquert nor fettle.
ment there. In order to accomplish either
of these, they must have transported a confi-
derable number of men into India. But, from
the defective firuc'ure of their ships, as well
as from the imnperfetion of their art in navi.
gating them, the ancients reldom ventured to
convey a body of troops to'.any di(tanCe byfea.
From Berenice to iMufiiS was tQ them, even
at'er tlippalqs had discovered thg tethod of
fLecring a direl course, and when their naval
(kill had attained to its higheflc fate of improve-
ment, a voyage of no lels than fiyenty days.
43y the ancient rotie along the coast of Persia,

a voyage

a voyage from' the Arabian Gulf to any part SE C T:c
of India must have been of greater length, iv.
and accomplished more ilowly. A&s no hostile
attack was ever made upon India by ;fa, either
by the Greek monarchs of Egypt, though the
two first of them were able and ambitious
Princes, or by the most enterprising of.the
Roman Emperors, it is evident that they must
have deemed it an attempt beyond their power
to execute. Alexander the Great, and, in imita-
tion of him, his successors, the monarchs of
Syria, were the only persons in the :ancient.
world who formed an idea of establishing their
dominion in any part of India; but it was with
armies led thither by land, that they hoped to
atchieve this.

III. THF sudden effet of opening a. direct

communication with the East, in lowering the
price of Indian commodities, is a circumrftance
that merits observation. How compendious
ioever the ancient intercourse with India may
appear to have been, it was attended with con-
lidcrable expence. The produ&ions of the.
remote parts of Asia, brought. to ,Ceylon, or to
tile ports on the rlMalabar coast, by the natives,
were put on board the ihips which arrived
fron the Arabian Gulf. At Berenice they
Were landed, and carried by camels two hundred

0o and

s' c T.' and. fifty, eight miles:. to..the banks of the; Nilec

"V'. There theyv were again edibarked, hnd conveyed,
C'"' down!the river to. Alexendria, xthicethey .were

difpatched,;to different markets. The addition;
to the price of goods by :fuich a multiplicity
of operations mull have been considerable,.
especially when the rate chargeable on each
operation was fixed by rioriopoaifts, fuibjet ,to
no controul... But, after the passage to India:
by the 'Cape ~of Gbod; Hope. was discovered,
its various cornm odities were pui'chafed at, first:
hand.in the countries of which they were the
growth or' irianufadure. In all these, pafticu,
larly in Indotan and in China, the subsistence
of man is'r ore abundant than in ainy other part
of the earth. The people live chiefly upon
rice, the most prolific of all grains. Popula-
tion,' of: consequence, is so great; and: labbur
so extremely cheap, that every produdion of
nature or .of art is fold at a very low. price
When these were ihipped in different,: parts
qs India, they were conveyed directly to Lisbon,
by a navigation, long indeed,' but uninterrupted
and safe, and thence circulated through Europe.
The carriage )of mercantile goods by water is
so much less expensive than by any other mode
of. conveyance, that as floon as the Portugucfe
'oukl. import thl produtions of India in us-
ficient, quantities to supply the demands of

Europe,

Europe; they were able to afford them; at such, s. E c CT,
a reduced prices that the competition of the; IV
Venetians ceased almbi: entirely, alnd -the full ''J'
fbeainm'of commerid f6ived in its 'natural -di-
rection towards the cheapest market. In what
proportion the Portuguese 'lowered the price'
of'In'dian commodities, I cannot ascertain with'
precision,' as I have not found in contemporary
writers sufficient' information with refpeEt to'
that point. ' Some idea, hoevever, of this, ap-
proaching perhaps near to accuracy, may be'
formed, from the computations of Mr. Munn,
an intelligent English merchant. He has pub-
lifhed a table of the prices paid 'for various
articles of goods in India, compared with the
prices for which" they were fold in Aleppo,
from which the difference appears to be nearly
as three to one; and he calculates, that, after a
reasonable allowance for the expence of the
voyage from India, the fame goods may be
fold in England at half the price which
they bear in Aleppo. The expence of con-
veying the productions of India up the
Persian Gulf to Baffora, and thence either
through the Great or Little Desert to Aleppo,
could not, I should imagine, differ confider-
ably from that by the Red Sea to Alex-
andria. We may thcrefore suppose, that the
Venetians might purchafC them from the

merchants

s. E c T.. merchants of that city, at nearly the farne, ratei

Il' for which they were fold in Aleppo; and then

1 aL
r we add to this, what they, malt have chaged a

their own profit in all the markets which, they
frequented, it is evident that-. the Portugutefi
might afford to reduce the commodities of the
East at a price below that which has been men.,
tioned, and might supply every part of Europ,
with them more than one-half cheaper than for,
merly. The enterprizing schemes of the Pore
tuguefe monarchs were accompliihed sooner, ,as
well as more completely, than in the hour of
most sanguine hope they could have presumed
to expet.; ,and early in the sixteenth century,
their fubjets became pofeffed of a monopoly of
the trade with India, founded upon the only
equitable title, that of furnifling its produCtions
in greater abundance, and at a more moderate
price.

IV. WE may observe, that in confequence.of

a more plentiful supply of Indian goods, and at
a cheaper rate, the demand for them increased
rapidly in every part of Europe., To trace,
the progrcfs of this in detail, would lead me fgr
beyond the period which I have fixed as the
limit of this I)ifquifition, but some general re-
marks concerning it will be found intimately
convc&ed with the ftrlbict of my inquiries,

conditi9o of individuals,. became so extremely
differe.nt,, that the wants and desires of men were
no longr ,the fame. Barbarians, :many of them

ornament and pride of the wealthy and luxurious
citizens of Rome, were not objeds of desire to
men, who, for a considerable time after they
took possession of their new conquests, retained
the original simplicity of their pastoral manners.
They advanced, however, from rudeness to re-
finement in the usual course of progreflion which
nations are deffined to hold, and an increase of
wants and desires requiring new objeEs to gra-
tify them, they began to acquire a relish for
.some of the luxuries of India. Among these
they had a singular predilecion for the fpiceries

and could afford to dispose of them--at such a Iv.
price, that, from: being an expensive luxury, I
they became an article of such general use, as
greatly augmented; the demand for them. An
effect similar to this may be observed, with
respect to the demand. for other commodities
imported from India, upon the reduction of
their price by the Portuguese. From that period
a growing tafle for Asiatic luxuries may be traced
/in every country of Europe, and the number of
ships fitted out for that'trade at Lisbon conti-

V. LUCRATIVE as the trade with India was,

and had long been deemed, it-is remarkable that
the Portuguese were fliffered. to remain in the
undift.rbed and excl.usive poffeflion of. it dur-
ing the course of almolt a century.. In the. an-
cient world, though Alexandria, from.the pe-
culiar felicity of its situation, could carry on an
intercourse with the East by sea, and circulate its
productions through Europe with such advan-
tage, as gave it a decided superiority over every
rival; yet various -attempts (which have been
delcribed in their proper places) were made,
from time to time; to obtain some share in a
commerce so apparently beneficial. From the

and Genoese exerted themselves alternately to
shut out each other from any share in the Indian
trade, it might have been expected that some
competitor would have arisen to call in question
the claim of the Portuguese to an exclusive right
of traffic with the East, and to wrest from them
some portion of it. There were, however, at
that time, some peculiar circumstances in the
political Rate of all those nations in Europe,
whose intrusion, as rivals, the Portuguese had
any reason to dread, which secured to them the
quiet enjoyment of their monopoly of Indian
commerce, during such a long period. From
the acceflion of Charles V. to the throne, Spain
was either so much occupied in a multiplicity of
operations in which it was engaged by the am-
bition of that monarch, and of his son Philip II.
or so intent on prosecuting its own discoveries
and conquests in the NewWorld, that although,
A.D. 1521. by the successful enterprize of Magellan, its

fleets were unexpecedly conducted by a new
course to that remote region of Asia which was
the feat of the most gainful and alluring branch
of trade carried on by the Portuguese, it could
make no considerable effort to avail itself of the
commercial advantages which it might have

1 2 derived

derived from that event. By the acquisition of s E C T.
the crown.of Portugal, in the year one thousand IV.
five hundred and eighty, the kings of Spain, in-
stead of the rivals, became the prote&ors of the
Portuguese trade, and the guardians of all its
exslufive rights. Throughout the sixteenth cen-
tury, the strength and resources of France were
so much wafted by the fruitless expeditions of
their mdnarchs into Italy, by their unequal con-
test with the power and policy of Charles V.
and by the calamities of the civil wars which
desolated the kingdom upwards of forty years,
that it could neither bestow much attention
upon objects of commerce, nor engage in any
scheme of distant enterprize. The Vene.ans,
how sensibly soever they might feel the morti-
fying reverse of being excluded, alnoft entirely,
from the Indian trade, of which their capital had
been formerly the chief feat, were so debilitated
and humbled by the League of Cambray, that
they were no longer capable of engaging in any
undertaking of magnitude. England, weakened
(as was formerly observed) by the long contest
between!the houses of York and Lancaster, and
just begintning to recover its proper vigour, was
restrained from aaaive exertion, during one part
of the fifteenth century, by the cautious
maxims of Henry VII. and wafted its strength,
idring another part of it, by engaging incon-

fiderately

pean power, had no futh. presentiment of: itstfi
ture eminence there, as to take an earl.y' partin

and a great part of the century elapsed before it
began to turn its attention towards'the Ealt.' '.i

rope found it necessary, from the circumstan.ces
which I have mentioned, to remain inactive
fpedators of what passed in the East, the Seven
United Provinces of the Low ,Countries, ret
cently formed into a fmrall state, still struggling
for political existence, and yet in the infancy
of its power, ventured to appear in the In-
dian ocean as the rivals of the Portuguese;
and, despising their pretensions to an exclusive
right of commerce with the extensive countries
to the eastward of the Cape of Good Iope, in-
vaded that monopoly which they had hitherto
guarded with such jealous attention. The Eng-
lifh soon followed the example of the Du)lh,
and both nations, at first by the enterprizing
industry of private adventurers, and afterdrards
by the more powerful efforts of trading ;ornl,
panics, under the proteetion of public authd-

14 rit,

ritv, advanced with affonifhing ardour and fuc- S E c T.
cess in this new career opened to them. The IV.
vast fabric of power which the Portuguese had '
ereced in the East (a fuper'ftrudure much too
large for the basis on which it had to refl) was
almost entirely overturned, in as short time, and
with as much facility, as it had been raised,
England and Holland, by driving them from
their niof valuable fettletnents, and seizing the
most lucrative branches of their trade, have
attained to that pre-eminence in naval power
and comrmercial opulence, by which they are
diftingtlifhed among the nations of Europe.

VI. THE coincidence, in point of time, of
the discoveries made by Columbus iri the Weft,
and those of Gama in the East, is a singular
circumitance, which merits observation, on ac-
count of the reniarkable influence of those
events in forming or ffrengthening the com-
mercial connection of the different quarters of
the globe with each other. In all ages, gold
and silver, particularly the latter, have been
the commodities exported with the greatest
profit to India. In no part of the earth do the
natives depend so little upon foreign countries,
either for the neceflaries or luxuries of life. The
bleflings of a favourable climate and fertile foil,
augmented by their own ingenuity, afford themn

p whatever

S E C T. whatever they desire. In consequence of this,

I"v trade with them has always been carried on in

one uniform manner, and the precious metals
have been given in exchange for their peculiar
produtions, whether of nature or art. But
when the communication with India was ren-
dered so much more easy, that the demand for
its commodities began to increase far beyond
what had been formerly known, if Europe
had not been supplied with the gold and silver
which it was necessary to carry to the markets
of the East from sources richer and more abun-
lAtnt than her own barren and impoverished
iniaes, 'iTe mluf either have abandoned the trade
vwih India altogether, or have continued. it with
inanifcft disadvantage. By iuch a continual.
drain of gold and silver, as well as by the un-
avoidable waste of both in circulation and in
manufacEures, the quantity of those metals mutl
have gone on diminishing, and their value
would have been so much enhanced, that they
could not have contiilued long to be of the falle,
utility in the commercial tranfadtions between
the two countries. But before the effctis of
this diminution could be very leufibly felt, Ame-.
rica opened her mines, and poured in treasures
upon Europe in the inoft copious fiream to
which mankind ever had access. This trcafurc,
inl fpie of innumncraLbc inx iious precautions to

prcvcnt

prevent it, flowed to the markets where the s E c T.
commodities necessary for supplying the wants, Iv.
or gratifying the luxury of the Spaniards, were
to be found; and from that time to the present,
the English and Dutch have purchased the pro-
ductions of China and Indoflan, with silver
brought from the mines of Mexico and Peru.
The immense exportation of silver to the Eaff,
during the course of two centuries, has not only
been replaced by the continual influx from Ame-
rica, but the quantity of it has been confider-
ably augmented, and at the fame time the
proportional rate of its value in Europe and in
India has varied so little, that it is chiefly with
silver that many of the capital articles imported
from the East are frill purchased.

WHILE America contributed in this manner

to facilitate and extend the intercourse of Europe
with Asia, it gave rife to a traffic with Africa,
which, from slender beginnings, has become so
considerable, as to form the chief bond of com-
mercial connetion with that continent. Soon
after the Portuguese had extended their disco-
veries on the coast of Africa beyond the river
Senegal, they endeavoured to derive tome be-
nefit from their new settlements there, by the
sale of slaves. Various circumstances combined
in favouring the revival of this odious traffic.

P 2 In

E C T. In every part of America, of which the Spa-
Iv. niards took poffefion, they found that the na-

tives, from the feebleness of their frame, from
their indolence, or from the injudicious manner
of treating them, were incapable of the exer.
tions requisite either for working mines, or for
cultivating the earth. Eager to find hands more
industrious and efficient, the Spaniards had re-
course to their neighbours the Portuguese, and
purchased from them negroe slaves. Experi.
ence soon discovered that they were men of a
more hardy race, and lb much better fitted for
enduring fatigue, that the labour of one negroe
was computed to be equal to that of four Ame-
ricansh; and from that time the number em-
ployed in the New World has gone on increaf-
iig with rapid progress. In this pratice, no
lets repugnant to the feelings of humanity than
to the principles of religion, the Spaniards have
unhappily been imitated by all the nations of
Europe, who have acquired territories in the
warmer climates of the New World, At pre-
sent the number of negroe slaves in the fettle-
ments of Great Britain and France in the Weft
Indies, exceeds a million; and as the establish-
Inent of servitude has been found, both in an-
cient and in modern times, extremely unfavour-

b Hlit, of America, vol. i. p. 32c.

able

able to population, it requires an annual importa. s E c T.
tion from Africa, of at least fifty-eight thousand lV'
to keep up the flocki. If it were poflible to
ascertain, with equal exa&nefs, the number of
slaves in the Spanifi dominions, and in North
America, the total number of negroe slaves
might be well reckoned at as many more.

Tr-ius the commercial genius of Europe,

vhich has given it a visible ascendant over the
three other divisions of the earth, by discerning
their refpeative wants and resources, and by
rendering them reciprocally subservient to one
another, has eflablifhed an union among them,
from which it has derived an inmmenfe increase
of opulence, of power, and of enjoyments.

VII. THOUGH the discovery of a New
World in the Wefl, and the opening of a
more easy and diredt communication with
the remote regions of the East co-operated
towards extending the commerce, and adding
to the enjoyments, of Europe, a remarkable
diflfrence may be observed, with refpet both to
the time and the manner in which they produced
these effects. When the Portuguese firIt visited
ihc different countries of Asia, firetching from
i Report of Lords of the Privy Council, A. D. 1788.

r , the

s EC r. the coafi of Malabar to China, they found

Iv. them poffelTed by nations highly civilized, which
'-^v hhad made corifidcrable progress in elegant as

well as useful arts, which were accustomed
to intercourse with strangers, and well ac.
quainted with all the advantages of commerce.
But when the Spaniards began to explore the
New World which they discovered, the afpeEt
which it presented to them was very diiferent.
The islands were inhabited by naked savages,
so unacquainted with the simplest and most
neceflary arts of life, that they subsisted" chiefly
on the spontaneous productions of a fertile
foil and genial climate. The continent ap.
peared to be a forest of immense extent, along
the coast of which were scattered tome feeble
tribes, not greatly superior to the islanders in
induflry or improvement. Even its two large
monarchies, which have been dignified with
the appellation of civilized flates, had not ad.
vanced so far beyond their countrymen, as to
be entitled to that name. The inhabitants, both
of Mexico and Peru, unacquainted with the
useful metals, and destitute of the address requi-
site for acquiring such command of the inferior
animals as to derive any conliderable aid from
their labour, had made so little progress in
agriculture, the firfl of all arts, that one of the
greatest difficulties with which the fmrall number

of

of Spaniards, who overturned those highly ex- s E C T.
tolled empires, had to struggle, was how to pro- Iv.
cure in them what was sufficient for their sub, .
fitence.

IT was of consequence, with a very different

ijirit, that the intercourse with two countries,
resembling each other so little in their degree
of improvement, was begun and carried on. The
Portuguese, certain of finding in the East, not
unly the produ&ions with which the bountiful
hand of Nature has enriched that part of the
globe, but various manufa&ures which had long
been known and admired in Europe, engaged
in this alluring trade with the greatest eagerness.
The encouragement of it their monarchs con,
fidered as a chiefobjea of government, towards
which they directed all the power of the king-
dom, and rouzed their fubjeds to such vigor-
ous exertions in the piofecution of it, as oc-
cafioned that astonishing rapidity of progress
which I have described. The sanguine hopes
with which the Spaniards entered upon their
career of discovery, met not with the fame
fpeely gratification. From the industry of
the rude inhabitants of the New World, they
did not receive a single article of commerce.
I'vcn the natural productions of the foil and
dlimate, when not cherifled and multiplied by

IV. little account. Hope, rather than success,

incited them to persis: in extending their re,
searches and conquefis; and as government de,
rived little immediate benefit from these, it left
the prosecution of them chiefly to private adven.
turers, by whose enterprising activity, more
than by any effort of the fate, the most valuable
poiTeflions of Spain in America were acquired,
Inflead of the inflantaneous and great advan,
tages which the Portuguese derived from their
discoveries above half a century elapsed before
the Spaniards reaped any benefit of consequence
from their conquests, except the inall quantities
of gold which the islanders were compelled
to collet:, and the plunder of the gold and
silver employed by the Mexicans and Peruvians
as ornaments of their persons and temples, or
as utensils of sacred or domestic use. It was
not until the discovery of the mines of Potofi
in Peru, in the year one thousand five hundred
and forty-five, and of tlofe of Sacotecas in
Mexico, soon after, that the Spanifli territories
in the New World brought a permanent and
valuable addition of wealth and revenue to the
miother country.

.NoR did the trade with India differ more
froml that with. America, in refpedt of the par-

ticular

ticular circumflance which I have explained, s E C T.
than in refpeft to the manner of carrying it on, iv.
after it grew to be a considerable object of U'.
political attention. Trade with the East was
a simple mercantile tranfadion, confined to
the purchase either of the natural produEtions
of the country, such as spices, precious flones,
pearls, &c. or of the manufactures which
abounded among an industrious race of men,
such as silk and cotton fluffs,, porcelane, &c.
Nothing more was requisite in conduAing
this trade, than to fettle a few skilful agents in
proper places, to prepare a proper assortment
of goods for completing thi cargoes of ships
as soon as they arrived from Europe, or at the
utmost to acquire the command of a few for-
tified stations, which might secure them ad-
miflion into ports where they might careen
in safety, and find proteEtion from the insults
of any hoflile power. There was no neceflity
of making any attempt to establish colonies,
either for the cultivation of the foil, or the
conduct of manufactures. Both these remained,
as formerly, in the hands of the natives.

BUTr as soon as that wild spirit of enterprize,

which animated the Spaniards who first explored
an(l subdued the New World, began to subside,
and when, inflead of roving as adventurers

~5 from

S E C T. from province to province in quest of gold and

Iv- silver, they seriously turned their thoughts towards

rendering their conquests beneficial by cultiva-
tion and industry, they found it neccffary to
cltlblifh colonies il every country which they
\vilhcd to improve. Other nations imitated
their example il the settlements which they
afterwards made in some of the islands, and on
the continent of North America. Europe, after
having desolated the New World, began to
repcople it, and under a system of colonization
(the spirit and regulations of which it is not
the object of this Disquisition to explain) the
European race has multiplied there amazingly.
Every article of commerce imported from the
New World, if we except the furs and skins
purchased from the independent tribes of hunters
in North America, and from a few tribes in
a finilar tfate on the Southern continent, is
the produce of the industry of Europeans fettled
there. To their exertions, or to those of hands
which they have taught or compelled to labour,
we are indebted for sugar, rum, cotton, tobacco,
indigo, rice, and even the gold and silver ex-
traded from the bowels of the earth. Intent
on those lucrative branches of industry, the in-
habitants of the New World pay little attention
to those kinds of labour which occupy a con.
fidcrable part of the members of other societies,

and

and depend, in some measure, for their sub- s E c T.
fiftence. :nd entirely for every article of elegance IV.
and luxury, upon the ancient continent. Thus
the Europeans have become manufacturers for
America, and their indlutry has been greatly
augmented by the vait demands for supplying
the \lants of extensive countries, the population
of which is continually increasing. Nor is the
influence of this demand confined solely to the
nations which have a more immediate connec-
tion with the American colonies; it is felt in
every part of Europe that furnishes any article
exported to them, and gives activity and vigour
to the hand of the artisan in the inland pro-
vinces of Germany, as well as to those in Great
Britain and other countries, which carry on a
direct trade with the New World.

BUT while the discovery and conquelf of

America is allowed to be one principal cause
of that rapid increase of industry and wealth,
which is conspicuous in Europe during the
two last centuries, some timid theories have
maintained, that throughout the fame period
Europe has been gradually impoverished, by
being drained of its treasure, in order to
carry on its trade with India. But this appre-
henfion has arisen from inattention to the nature
and ufc of the precious metals. They are to

of Mexican and Peruvian dollars which are ne-

must give a certain quantity of its woollen or
cotton cloth or hard-ware, then the hands
of an additional number of manufacturers
are rendered active, and work to a certain

IV. the Turkish Sultans, by being masters of Egypt

mand of it, whether the productions of the East
were conveyed by the Red Sea to Alexandria,
or were transported by land-carriage from the
Persian Gulf to Couftantinople, and the ports
of the Mediterranean. The monarchs who
were then at the head of this great empire,
were neither destitute of abilities to perceive
the pre-eminence to which this would have
elevated them, nor of ambition to aspire to it.
Selim, the conqueror of the Mameluks, by
confirming the ancient privileges of the Vene-
tians in Egypt and Syria, and by his regula-
tions concerning the duties on Indian goods,
which I have already mentioned, early dif-
covered his solicitude to secure all the ad-
vantages of commerce with the East to his
own dominions. The attention of Solyman
the Magnificent, his successor, seems to have
been equally directcd towards the fame objet.
More enlightened than any monarch of the
Ottoman race, he attended to all the tranifations
of the European tdates, and had observed the
power as well as opulence to which the republic
of Venice had attained by cngrofling the com-

he formed a scheme suitable to his charater Iv.
for political wisdom and the appellation of Inf/i-
tutor of Rules, by which the Turkish Historians
have diftinguifled him, and established, early in
his reign, a system of commercial laws in his do-
minions, by which he hoped to render Conftan-
tinople the great flaple of Indian trade, as it
had been in the prosperous ages of the Greek
empire :. For accomplifning this scheme,
however, he did not rely on the operation of
laws alone ; he fitted out about the fame time
a formidable fleet in the Red Sea, under the
conduct of a confidential officer, with such a
body of janizaries on board of it, as he A.D. 15?.

guefe out of ll their new settlements in

forts of valour and constancy, entitled to
the splendid success with which they were
crowned, repulsed this powerful armament in
every enterprize it undertook, and compelled

with the moif sanguine hopes of terminating

Solyman, though he never relinquished the
design of expelling the Portuguese from India,
and of acquiring some establishment there, was
so occupied during the remainder of his reign,
by the multiplicity of arduous operations in
which an insatiable ambition involved him, that
he never had leisure to resume the prosecution
of it with vigour.

IF either the measures of Selim had produced

the effect which he expected, or if the more
adventurous and extensive plan of Solyman had
been carried into execution, the command of
the wealth of India, together with such a marine
as the monopoly of trade with that country
has, in every age, enabled the power which pof-
sessed it to create and maintain, mufst have
brought an accession of force to an empire
already formidable to mankind, that would

I SHALL now endeavour to fulfil an en.

gagement which I came under , to make

some observations upon the genius, the manners,
and inflitutions of the people of India, as far
as they can be traced from the earliest ages
to which our knowledge of them extends. Were
I to enter upon this wide field with an intention
of surveying its whole extent; were I to view
each objet which it presents to ; philosophical
inquirer, under all its different afpeds, it would
lead me into researches and speculations, not
only of immense length, but altogether foreign
from the subjed of this Disquisition. My in-
quiries and reflecions shall therefore be con-
fined to what is intimately conneaed with the

a See page 27.

Q-2 dcfign

design of this work. I shall collect the fats
which the ancients have transmitted to us con-
cerning the institutions peculiar to the natives
of India, and, by comparing them with what
we now know of that country, endeavour to
deduce such conclusions as tend to point out
the circumstances which have induced the reft
of mankind, in every age, to carry on com-
mercial intercourse to so great an extent with
that country.

OF this intercourse there are conspicuous

proofs in the earliest periods concerning which
hifory affords information. Not only the
people contiguous to India, but remote nations,
fccm to have ben acquainted, from time im-
memorial, with its commodities, and to have
valued them so highly, that in order to procure
them they undcitook fatiguing, expenfivc, and
dangerous journeys. WVhenever men give a
decided preference to the commodities of any
particular country, this muffl be owing either
to its poifcing some valuable natural produc-
tions peculiar to its foil and climate, or to some
superior progrcs which its inhabitants have
made in industry, art, and elegance. It is not
to any peculiar excellence in the natural produc-
tions of India, that we mtuft ascribe entirely the
prcdlilcaion of ancient nations for its comnuodli-

tics;

ties; for, pepper excepted, an article, it murt
be allowed, of great importance, they are little
different from those of other tropical countries;
and Ethiopia or Arabia might have fully sup.
plied the Phenicians, and other trading people
of antiquity, with the spices, the perfumes,
the precious stones, the gold and silver, which
formed the principal articles of their com-
merce.

WHOEVER then wi/hes to trace the commerce

with India to its source, nmut search for it, not
so much in any peculiarity of the natural pro-
ductions of that country, as in the superior im-
provement of its inhabitants. Many facts have
been tranfinitted to us, which, if they are ex-
amined with proper attention, clearly demon-
firate, that the natives of India were not only
more early civilized, but had made greater pro-
grefs in civilization than any other people.
These I flall endeavour to enumerate, and to
place them in such a point of view as may
serve both to throw light upon the inflitu-
tions, manners, and arts of the Indians, and to
account for the eagerness of all nations to
obtain the productions of their ingenious in-
lultry.

BY the ancient Heathen writers, the Indians
Mcre reckoned among those races of men which

Q 3 they

they denominated Autockt/ones or Aboriginesx
whom they confidered as natives of the foil,
whose origin could not be tracedb. By the
inspired writers, the wisdom of the East (an
expreflion which is to be understood as a de-
scription of their extraordinary progress in
science and arts) was early celebratedc. In
order to illufsrate and confirm these explicit
testimonies concerning the ancient and high
civilization of the inhabitants of India, I shall
take a view of their rank and condition as
individuals; of their civil policy; of their laws
and judicial proceedings; of their useful and
elegant arts; of their sciences; and of their
religious institutions ; as far as information cati
be gathered from the accounts of the Greek
and Roman writers, compared with what still
remains of their ancient acquirements and in.
ftitutions.

we learn, that the diftinaion of ranks and fe-
paration of profeflions were completely efta.

demand of his own limited desires. A savage
can form his bow, point his arrows, rear his hut,
and hollow his canoe, without calling in the
aid of any hand more ikilful than his ownd.
But when time has augmented the wants of men,
the productions of art become so complicated
in their ftruture, or so curious in their fabric,
that a particular course of education is requisite
towards forming the artist to ingenuity in con-
trivance and expertness in execution. In pro-
portion as refinement spreads, the diftincion
of professions increases, and they branch out
into more numerous and minute subdivisions.
Prior to the records of authentic history, and
even before the most remote aera to which their
own traditions pretend to reach, this separation
of professions had not only taken place among
the natives of India, but the perpetuity of it was
secured by an institution which must be con-
fidered as the fundamental article in the fyflem
of their policy. The whole body of the people
was divided into four orders or cafls. The
members of the first, deemed the most sacred,
had it for their province, to fludy the prin-
ciples of religion; to perform its funEtions;
and to cultivate the sciences. They were the
priests, the inftrutors, and philosophers of the

nation. T'he members of the fc6ncd order
were entrusted with the government and defence
of the slate. In peace they were its ruler bi'd
magiitrates, in war they were the generals who
commanded its armies and the soldiers who
fought its battles. The third was corippofed
of husbandmen and merchants; and the fourth
of artisans, labourers, and servants. None
of there can ever quit his own cast, or be ad-
rnitted into another'. The station of every
individual is unalterably fixed; his destiny
is irrevocable; and the walk of life is marked
nut, from which he must never deviate. This
line of separation is not only established by
civil authority, but confirmed and fanfioned
by religion; and each order or cast is said
to have proceeded from the Divinity in such
a different manner, that to mingle and con-
found them Would be deemed an at of most
daring impiety f. Nor is it between the
four different tribes alone that such infupe-
rable barriers are fixed; the members 'of each
ca(t adhere invariably to the profefion of
their forefathers. From generation to ge-
neration, the fame families have followed,

and

and will always continue to folloW,"one uniform
line of life.

SuCH arbitrary arrangements of the various

members which compose a community, seem,
at first view, to be adverse to improvement
either in science or in arts; and by forming
around the different orders of men artificial
barriers, which it would be impious to pals,
tend to circumscribe the operations of the human
mind within a narrower sphere than nature has
allotted to them. When every man is at full
liberty to direct his efforts towards those objects
and that end which the impulse of his own mind
prompts him to prefer, he may be expeEted
to attain that high degree of eminence to which
the uncontrolled exertions of genius and industry
naturally conduct. The regulations of Indian
policy, with refpe& to the different orders of
men, muff necessarily, at tome times, check
genius in its career, and confine to the functions
of an inferior cast, talents fitted to shine in an
higher sphere. But the arrangements of civil
government are made, not for what is extraor-
dinary, but for what is common; not for the
few, but for the many. The objet of the
firlt Indian legislators was to employ the molf
cffcdual means of providing for the subsistence,
the fccuriry, and happiness of all the members

of

of the community over which they presided.
With this view they set apart certain races
of men for each of the various professions
and arts neceflary in a well-ordered society,
and appointed the exercise of them to be tranf-
mitted from father to son in succession. This
system, though extremely repugnant to the
ideas which we, by being placed in a very dif-
ferent ltate of society, have formed, will be
found, upon attentive infpecion, better adapted
to attain the end in view, than a careless ob-
server, at first fight, is apt to imagine. The
human mind bends to the law of necessity, and
is accustomed, not only to accommodate itself to
the restraints which the condition of its nature, or
the institutions of its country, impose, but to ac-
quiefce in them. From his entrance into life, an
Indian knows the Rfation allotted to him, and the
funcions to which he is derfined by his birth.
The objects which relate to there, are the firfl that
present themselves to his view. They occupy
his thoughts, or employ his hands; and, from
his earliest years, he is trained to the habit of
doing with cafe and pleasure, that which he must
continue through life to do. To this may be
ascribed that high degree of perfection 'con-
fpicuous in many of the Indian manufactures;
and though vencration for the practiccs of
their ancestors may check the spirit of inven-

tion,

tiol, yet, by adhering to these, they acquire
such an expertness and delicacy of hand, that
Europeans, with all the advantages of superior
science, and the aid of more complete inftru.
ments, have never been able to equal the ex-
quifite execution of their workmanship. While
this high improvement of their more curious
manufactures excited the admiration, and at-
tracted the commerce of other nations, the
reparation of professions in India, and the early
distribution of the people into classes, attached
to particular kinds of labour, secured such abund-
ance of the more common and useful commodi-
ties, as not only supplied their own wants, but mi.
niftered to those of the countries around them.

To this early division of the people into

casts, we muff likewise ascribe a firiking pecu-
liarity in the slate of India; the permanence
of its inifitutions, and the immutability in the
manners of its inhabitants. What now is in
India always was there, and is likely frill
to continue: neither the ferocious violence and
illiberal fanaticism of its Mahomedan conquerors,
nor the power of its European mailers, have
effected any considerable alteration E. The fame

arrangements in civil and domestic society
remain, the fame maxims of religion are held
in veneration, and the fame sciences and: arts-
are cultivated. Hence, in all ages, the trade
with India has been the fame; gold and silver
have uniformly been carried thither in order
to purchase the fame commodities with which
it now supplies all nations; and from the age
of Pliny to the present times, it has been always
confidered and execrated as a gulf which fwal.
lows up the wealth of every other country,
that flows incessantly towards it, and from which
it never returns .. According to the accounts
which I have given of the cargoes anciently
imported from India, they appear to have con.
silted of nearly the fame articles with those of
the investments in our own times; and what-
ever diilerence we may observe in them seems
to have arisen, not so much from any diversity
in the nature of the commodities which the
Indians prepared for sale, as from a variety in
the taftes or in the wants of the nations which
demanded them.

civilization of the people of India, may be
deduced from confidering their political con-

ftitution and form of government. The Indians
trace back the history of their own country
through an immense fucceflion of ages, and
aflert, that all Asia, from the mouth of the
Indus on the weft, to the confines of China
on the east, and from the mountains of Thibet
on the north, to Cape Comorin on the south,
formed a vait empire, subjed to one mighty
sovereign, under whom ruled several hereditary
Princes and Rajahs. But their chronology,
which measures the life of man in ancient times
by thousands of years, and computes the length
of the several periods, during which it supposes
the world to have existed, by millions, is so
wildly extravagant, as not to merit any serious
diicuflion. We -must reft satisfied, then, until
some more certain information is obtained with
refpet to the ancient history of India, with
taking the firit accounts of that country, which
can be deemed authentic, from the Greeks,
who served under Alexander the Great. They
found kingdoms of considerable magnitude
eftablifled in that country. The territories of
Porus and of Taxiles comprehended a great
part of the Panjab, one of the nmolt fertile and
belc cultivated countries in India. The king-
(dom of the Prafij, or Gandaridr, firetched

All the three, as appears fiom the anicicit Greek
Writers, were powerful and populous.

THIs description of the partition of India

into states of such magnitude, is alone a con.
vincing proof of its having advanced far in
civilization. In whatever region of the earth
there has been an opportunity of observing the
progress of men in social life, they appear at firll
in small independent tribes or communities.
Their common wants prompt them to unite;
and their mutual jealousies, as well as the necef-
fity of securing subsistence, compel them to
drive to a distance every rival who might en-
croach on those domains which they confider as
their own. Many ages elapse before they
coalesce, or acquire sufficient foresight to pro.
vide for the wants, or sufficient wisdom to con.
duc the affairs of a numerous society. Even
under the genial climate, and in the rich foil of
India, more favourable perhaps to the union and
increase of the human species than any other
part of the globe, the formation of such exten-
five flates, as were eltablifhed in that country
when first visited by Europeans, must have been
a work of long time; and the members of them
nmui have been long accustomed to exertions of
useful industry.

despotic power. No trace, indeed, is diTo;
vered there of any assembly or public body, the
members of which, either in their own right, or
as representatives of their fellow-citizens, could
interpose in ena&ing laws, or in superintending
the execution of them. Infitutions defsined to
assert and guard the rights belonging to men in
a social state, how familiar soever the idea
may be to the people of Europe, never formed
a part of the political constitution in any great
Asiatic kingdom. It was to different principles
that the natives of India were indebted for re-
ftricions which limited the exercise of regal
power. The rank of individuals was unalter-
ably fixed, and the privileges of the different
casts were deemed inviolable. The monarchs
of India, who are all taken from the second of
the four classes formerly described, which is
intrusted with the functions of government and
exercise of war, behold among their fubjeds an
order of men far superior to thenfelves in
dignity, and so conscious of their own pre-
eminence, both in rank and in fanEtity, that they
would deem it degradation and pollution, if they
were to eat of the fame food with their fove-

As

As none but the members of the cast next in
rank to that which religion has rendered sacred,
could be employed in any funcion of the state,
the sovereigns of the extensive kingdoms an.
ciently established in India, found it necessary to
entrust them with the superintendence of the
cities and provinces too remote to be under
their own immediate infpeEion. In there fta.
tions they often acquired such wealth and influ-
ence, that offices conferred during pleasure,
continued hereditarily in their families, and they
came gradually to form an intermediate order
between the sovereign and his fubjeds; and, by
the vigilant jealousy with which they maintained
their own dignity and privileges, they constrained
their rulers to refped them, and to govern with
moderation and equity.

NoR were the benefits of these restraints

upon the power of the sovereign confined wholly
to the two superior orders in the Rate; they
extended, in some degree, to the third class
employed in agriculture. The labour's of that
numerous and useful body of men are so effen-
tial to the preservation and happiness of society,
that the greatest attention was paid to render
their condition secure and comfortable. Ac-
cording to the ideas which prevailed among the
natives of India (as we are informed by the

Ir first

firit Europeans who visited their country), the
sovereign is confidered as the sole universal
proprietor of all the land in his dominions, and
from him is derived every species of tenure by
which his fubjets can hold it. These lands
were let out to the farmers who cultivated them,
at a ltipulated rent, amounting usually to a fourth
part of their annual produce paid in kind °. In
a country where the price of work is extremely
low, and where the labour of cultivation is very
inconsiderable, the earth yielding its producions
almost spontaneously, where subsistence is amaz.
ingly cheap, where few clothes are needed, and
houses are built and furnished at little expence,
this rate cannot be deemed exorbitant or oppref-
five. As long as the husbandman continued to
pay the eltablilhed rent, he retained possession
of the farm, which descended, like property,
from father to son.

THESE accounts given by ancient authors of

the condition and tenure of the renters of land
in India, agree so perfecly with what now takes
place, that it may be confidered almost as a
description of the present {late of its cultivation.

name by which the renters of land are diftin.
guifhed, hold their poffefions by a lease, which
may be confidered as perpetual, and at a rate
fixed by ancient surveys and valuations. This
arrangement has been so long established, and
accords so well with the ideas of the natives,
concerning the distinctions of casts, and the
functions allotted to each, that it has been in-
violably maintained in all the provinces subjed
either to Malhomedans or Europeans; and, to
both, it serves as the basis on which their whole
system of finance is founded P. In a more re-
mote period, before the original inifitutions of
India were subverted by foreign invaders, the
industry of the husbandman, on which every
member of the community depended for sub-
fiftence, was as secure as the tenure by which he
held his lands was equitable. Even war did not
interrupt his labours or endanger his property.
It was not uncommon, we are informed, that
while two hostile armies were fighting a battle
in one field, the peasants were ploughing or
reaping in the next field in perfea tranquillity 9.
These maxims and regulations of the ancient
legislators of India have a near resemblance to
the system of those ingenious speculators on
political ceconomy in modern times, who re.
P Sec NOTE LX1. q Strab. lib. xv. p: o3o. A,

R 2 present

present the produce of land as the sole source of
wealth in every country ; and who confider the
discovery of this principle, according to which
they contend that the government of nations
ihould be conduced, as one of the greatest
efforts of human wisdom. Under a form of
government, which paid such attention to all the
different orders of which the society is com.
posed, particularly the cultivators of the earth,
it is not wonderful that the ancients should
describe the Indians as a most happy race of
men; and that the most intelligent modern ob.
servers should celebrate the equity, the huma.
nity, and mildness of Indian policy. A Hindoo
Rajah, as I have been informed by persons well
acquainted with the Ltate of India, resembles
more a father presiding in a numerous family of
his own children, than a sovereign ruling over
inferiors, subje't to his dominion. He endea-
vours to secure their happiness with vigilant
solicitude; they are attached to him with the
most tender affection and inviolable fidelity.
We can hardly conceive men to be placed in
any state more favourable to their acquiring all
the advantages derived from social union. It is
only when the mind is perfectly at ease, and
neither feels nor dreads oppreflion, that it em-
ploys its active powers in forming numerous
arrangements of police, for securing its enjoy-

nients

ments and increasing them. Many arrange-
ments of this nature the Greeks, though
accustomed to their own institutions, the molt
perseEt at that time in Europe, observed and
admired among the Indians, and mention them
as instances of high civilization and improve-
ment. There were eftabliihed among the In-
dians three diftint classes of officers, one of
which had it in charge to infpet agriculture,
and every kind of country work. They mea-
fured the portions of land allotted to each
renter. They had the custody of the hanks, or
public reservoirs of water, without a regular
distribution of which, the fields in a torrid cli,
mate cannot be rendered fertile, they marked
out the course of the highways, along which, at
certain distances, they erected flones, to mea-
sure the road and direct travellers r To officers
of a second class was committed the infpeAion
of the police in cities; their fundtions, of course,
were many and various; some of which only I
fliall specify. They appropriated houses for the
reception of strangers; they protected them from
injury, provided for their subsistence, and, when
I'ized with any dileafe, they appointed phyfi-
cians to attend them; and, on the event of their
death, they not only buried them with decency,

but took charge of their effeAs, and restored
them to their relations, They kept exac re.
gifters of births and of deaths. They visited the
public markets,' and examined weights and
measures. The third class of officers fuperin.
tended the military department; but, as the
objects to which their attention was direEted are
foreign from the fubjc& of my inquiries, it is
unnecessary to enter into any detail with refped
to them '.

As manners and customs in India descend

almoil without variation from age to age, many
of the peculiar institutions which I have enu-
merated flill fubfitl there. There is shill the
fame attention to the conltrution and preferva-
tion of tanks, and the distribution of their wa-
ters. The diredtion of roads, and placing stones
along them, is fiill an object of police. Choul-
tries, or houses built for the accommodation
of travellers, are frequent in every part of the
country, and are useful as well as noble monu-
ments of Indian munificence and humanity. It
is only among men in the most improved Rtate
of society, and under the best forms of govern-
ment, that we discover institutions firilar to

m Strabo, lib. xv p. 1034. A. &c. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii

those

those which I have described; and many nations
have advanced far in their progress, without
eftablifling arrangemients of police equally
perseet.

III. IN eftlmating the progress which any

nation has made in civilization, the object that
merits the greatef degree of attention, next to
its political constitution, is the spirit of the laws
and nature of the forms by which its judicial
proceedings are regulated. In the early and
rude ages of society, the few disputes with re-
fpeEt to property which arise, are terminated by
the interposition of the old men, or by the
authority of the chiefs in every finall tribe or
community; their decisions are dictated by their
own discretion, or founded on plain and ob-
vious maxims of equity. But as the controver-
fies multiply, cafes similar to such as have been
formerly determined mufft recur, and the
awards upon these grow gradually into prece-
dents, which serve to regulate future judgments.
Thus, long before the nature of property is
defined by positive tlatutes, or any rules pre-
fcribed concerning the mode of acquiring or
conveying it, there is gradually formed, in
every state, a body of customary or common
law, by which judicial proceedings are direEted,
anld cvery decision conforjnable to it is fuibmitted

1: 4 to

to with reverence, as the result of the accuml.
lated wisdom and experience of ages.

IN this {late the adminifiration of juflice seems

to have been in India when first visited by Eu-
ropeans. Though the Indians, according to
their account, had no written laws, but deter-
mined every controverted point, by recollecing
what had been formerly decided '; they assert,
that justice was dispensed among them with
great accuracy, and that crimes were most
severely punished". But in this general ob.
servation is contained all the intelligence which
the ancients furnish concerning the nature and
forms of judicial proceedings in India. From
the time of Megallhenes, no Greek or Roman
of any note appears to have resided long enough
in the country, or to have been so much ac-
quainted with the customs of the natives, as to
be capable of entering into any detail with re.
fpet to a point of so great importance in their
policy. Fortunately, the defets of their in-
formation have been amply supplicd by the more
accurate and extensive researches of the mo-
derns. During the course of alnoft three cen-
turies, the number of persons who have resorted

from

from Europe to India has been great. Many
of them, who have remained long in the coun-
try, and were persons of liberal education and
enlarged minds, have lived in such familiarj in-
tercourfe with the natives, and acquired so com-
petent a knowledge of their languages, as enabled
them to observe their institutions with attention,
and to describe them with fidelity. Refpeecable
as their authority may be, I flall not, in what
I offer for illustrating the judicial proceedings
of the Hindoos, reft upon it alone, but shall
derive my information from sources higher and
more pure.

TOWARDS the middle of the sixteenth cen-

tury, Akber the sixth, in descent from Tamer-
lane, mounted -the throne of Indoftan. He is
one of the few sovereigns entitled to the appel-
lation both of Great and Good, and the only
one of Mahomedan race, whose mind ap-
pears to have risen so far above all the illiberal
prejudices of that fanatical religion in which he
was educated, as to be capable of forming a plan
worthy of a monarch who loved his people, and
was solicitous to render them happy. As, in
every province of his extensive dominions, the
llindoos formed the great body of his fubjecs,
he laboured to acquire a perfect knowledge of
their religion, their sciences, their laws, and in-

Atitutions ;

flitutions; in order that he might conduct every
part of his government, particularly the admi-
niltration of justice, in a manner as much ac.
commodated as poffibIc to their own ideas'.
In this generous undertaking he was seconded
with zeal by his vizier Abul Fazel, a minifler
whose underftandling was not less enlightened
than that of his master. By their afiduous
researches, and consultation of learned men Y,
such information was obtained as enabled Abul
Fazel to publish a brief compendium of Hindoo
jurilprudence in the Ayeen Akbery , which
may be confidered as the first genuine com-
munication of its principles to persons of a dif.
A. D. 773. ferent religion. About two centuries afterwards,

the illultrious example of Akber was imi-
tated and surpassed by Mr. Hastings, the Go-
vernor General of the Britiflh Settlements in
India. By his authority, and under his infpec-
tion, the molt eminent Pundits, or Brahmins
learned in the laws, of the provinces over which
he presided, were assembled at Calcutta; and,
in the course of two years, compiled, from their
moit ancient and approved authors, sentence by
sentence, without addition or diminution, a full
code of IIindoo laws ; which is, undoubtedly,

the

the mofl valuable and authentic elucidation of
Indian policy and manners that has been hitherto
communicated to Europe.

ACCORDING to the Pundits, some of the

writers upon whose authority they found the de-
crees which they have inserted in the Code,
lived several millions of years before their time h;
and they boast of having a fucceflion of ex-
pounders of their laws from that period to the
present. Without entering into any examination
of what is so extravagant, we may conclude,
that the Hindoos have in their possession treatises
concerning the laws and jurisprudence of their
country, of more remote antiquity than are to
be found in any other nation. The truth of
this depends nof upon their own testimony alone,
but it is put beyond doubt by one circumflance,
that all these treatises are written in the Sanikreet
language, which has not been spoken for many
ages in any part of Indoflan, and is now under-
stood by none but the most learned Brahmins.
That the Ilindoos were a people highly civil-
ized, at the time when their laws were com-
poscd, is most clearly established by internal
evidence contained in the Code itself. Among
nations beginning to emerge from barbarism,

the regulations of law are extremely simple,
'and applicable only to a few obvious cafes of
daily occurrence. Men mufft have been long
united in a social slate, their tranfations must
have been numerous and complex, and judges
must have determined an immense variety of
controversies to which these give rife, before
the system of law becomes so voluminous and
comprehensive as to direcQ the. judicial proceed.
ings of a nation far advanced in improvement.
In that early age of the Roman republic, when
the laws of the Twelve 'fables were promul-
gated, nothing more was required than the
laconic injunctions which they contain for regu.
lating the decisions of courts of justice; but,
in a later period, the body of civil law, ample
as its contents are, was found hardly sufficient
for that purpose. To the jejune brevity of the
Twelve Tables, the Hindoo Code has no re-
semblance, but with refpeEt to the number and
variety of points it confiders, it will bear a corn.
parison with the celebrated Digest of Juflinian;
or with the fyfftems of jurifprudcnce in nations
most highly civilized. The articles of which
the Hindoo Code is compored, are arranged in
natural and luminous order. They are nu-
merous and comprehensive, and investigate4
with that minute attention and discernment
which are natural to a people diltinguifled for

actte-

acurenefs and fubtility of underflanding, who
have been long accustomed to the accuracy
of judicial proceedings, and acquainted with
all the refinements of legal pracice. The de-
cifions concerning every point (with a few
exceptions occasioned by local prejudices and
peculiar cufroms) are founded upon the great
and immutable principles of justice which the
human mind acknowledges and refpeds, in
every age, and in all parts of the earth. Who-
ever examines the whole work, cannot enter-
tain a doubt of its containing the jurisprudence
of an enlightened and commercial people.
Whoever looks into any particular title, will
be surprised with a minuteness of detail and
nicety of diftintion, which, in many inifances,
seem to go beybnd the attention of European
legislation; and it is remarkable that some of
the regulations which indicate the greatest de-
gree of refinement, were established in periods
of the most remote antiquity. " In the first
" of the sacred law trads, (as is observed by
" a person to whom Oriental literature, in all
" its branches, has been greatly indebted,)
" which the Hindoos suppose to have been
" revealed by Menu some millions of years
" ago, there is a curious paflage on the legal
"intercll of money, and the limited rate of it
"in different calcs, with an exception in re-

I ' ' gard

" gard to adventures at sea; an exception
" which the sense of mankind approves, and

which commerce absolutely requires, though

" it was not before the reign of Charles I.
" that our English jurisprudence fully admit-
"ted it in refpea of maritime contrads'."
It is likewise worthy of notice, that though the
natives of India have been diftinguithed in
every age for the humanity and mildness of
their disposition, yet such is the solicitude of
their law-givers to preserve the order and tran-
quillity of society, that the punifmients which
they infli& on criminals, are (agreeably to an
observation of the ancients already mentioned)
extremely rigorous. " Punishment (according
" to a striking personification in the Hindoo
' code) is the magistrate; punishment is the
" inspirer of terror ; punishment is the nourisher
" of the fubjets; punishment is the defender
"from calamity; punishment is the guardian
"of those that sleep; punishment, with a
" black aspet, and a red eye, terrifies the
"guilty."

IV. As the condition of the ancient inha'
bitants of India, whether we confider them as

indivi-

individuals, or as members of society, appears,
froml the preceding investigation, to have been
extremely favourable to the cultivation of useful
and elegant arts; we are naturally led to in-
quire, whether the progress which they acually
made in them, was such as might have been
expeced from a people in that situation. In
attempting to trace this progress, we have not
the benefit of guidance equal to that which
conduted our researches concerning the former
articles of inquiry. The ancients, from their
ilender acquaintance with the interior slate of
India, have been able to communicate little
information with refpe& to the arts cultivated
there; and though the moderns, during their
continued intercourse with India for three cen-
turies, have had access to observe them with
greater attention, it is of late only, that by
studying the languages now and formerly spoken
in India, and by consulting and translating
their molt eminent authors, they have begun
to enter into that path of inquiry which leads
with certainty to a thorough knowledge of the
itate of arts cultivated in that country. ,

ONE of the first arts which human ingenuity

aiimcd at improving, beyond what mere necessity
requires, was that of building. In the brief re-

15 marks

marks which the fubjecE of my inquiries leads
me to make on the progress of this art in India,
I ihall confine my attention wholly to those of
higheit antiquity. The most durable monu.
ments of human industry ate public buildings.
The productions of art formed for the commol
purposes of life, waste and perish in using them;
but works destined for the benefit of posterity
subsist through ages, and it is according to
the manner in which these are executed, that
we form a judgment with refpet to the de,
gree of power, skill, and improvement to which
the people by whom they were ere&ed had
attained. In every part of India monuments
of high antiquity are found. These are
of two kinds, such as were consecrated to the
offices of religion, or fortresses built for the
security of the country. In the former of there,
to which Europeans, whatever their ftruture
may be, give the general name of Pagodas,
we may observe a diversity of stile, which both
marks the gradual progress of architecture,
and throws light on the general state of arts
and manners in diilerent periods. The most
early Pagodas appear to have been nothing
more than excavations in mountainous parts
of the country, formed probably in imitation
ps the natural caverns to which the first in-

habitants

habitants of the earth retired for safety during
the night, and where they found flelter from
the inclemency of the seasons. The most
celebrated, and, as there is reason to believe,
the nmol ancient of all there, is the Pagoda
in the island Elephanta, at no great difiance
from Bombay. It has been hewn by the hands
of man out of a solid rock, about half way up
a high mountain, and formed into a spacious
area, nearly I20 feet square. In order to sup-
port the roof, and the weight of the mountain -
that lies above it, a number of malfy pillars,
and of a form not inelegant, have been cut out of
the fame rock, at such regular distances, as on
the first entrance presents to the eye of.the spec-
tator an appearance both of beauty and of
firength. Great part of the inside is covered
w ith human figures in high relief, of gigantic
size as well as singular forms, and diftinguiihed
by a variety of symbols, representing, it is pro-
bable, the attributes of the deities whom they
uworflipped, or the ations of the heroes whom
they admired. In the isle of Salfette, still
nearer to 13ombayj are excavacations in a similar
itile, hardly inferior in magnificence, and def-
tined for the fame religious purposes.

'ITh'SE tupendous works are of fich high
:!iiti ity, that as the natives cannot, either from

s hiltory

history or tradition, give any information concern-
ing the time in which they were executed, they
universally ascribe the formation of them to the
power of fupcrior beings. From the extent
and grandeur of these subterraneous mansions,
which intelligent travellers compare to the
most celebrated monuments of human power
and art in any part of the earth, it is manifefl
that they could not have been formed in that
flage of social life where men continue divided
into small tribes, unaccuflomed to the efforts
of persevering industry. It is only in States
of considerable extent, and among people long
habituated to subordination, and to ad with
concert, that the idea of such magnificent works
is conceived, or the power of accomplishing
them can be found.

TI.AT folne such powerful slate was efta-

blined in India at the time when the excavations
in the islands of Elephanta and Salfette were
formed, is not the only conclusion to be drawn
from a survey of them; the stile in which the
sculptures with which they are adorned is ex-
ecuted, indicates a considerable improvement
in art at that early period. Sculpture is the
imitative art in which ran seems to have made
the first trial of his own talents. But even in
those countries where it has attained to the

highelR

highest degree of perfection, its progress has
been extremely flow. Whoever has attended
to the history of this art in Greece, knows how
far removed the first rude essay to represent
the human form,, was from any complete de,
lineation of ite. But the different groupes of
figures which fill remain entire in the Pagoda
of Elephanta, however low they muff rank if
they be compared with the more elegant works
of Grecian or even Etruscan artists, are finished
in a stile considerably superior to the hard, in-
expressive manner of the Egyptians, or to the
figures in the celebrated palace of Persepolis.
In this light they have appeared to persons
abundantly qualified to appretiate their merit,
and from different drawings, particularly those
of Niebuhr, a traveller equally accurate in
observing, and faithful in describing, we must
form a favourable opinion of the slate of arts in
India at that period.

IT is worthy of notice, that although several
of the figures in the caverns at Elephanta be
so different from those now exhibited in the
Pagodas as objecs of veneration, that some
learned Europeans have imagined they repre-

sent the rites of a religion more ancient than
that now eftablilhed in Indoflan, yet by the
Hindoos themselves the caverns are confidered
as hallowed places of their own worship, and
they still resort thither to perform their devo.
tions, and honour the figures there, in the fame
manner with those in their own Pagodas. In
confirmation of this, I have been informed by
an intelligent observer, who virfted this fubter.
raneous fanduary in the year 1782, that he'was
accompanied by a sagacious Brahmin, a native
of Benares, who, though he had never been
in it before that time, recognized, at once, all
the figures; was well acquainted with the pa-
rentage, education, and life of every deity or
human peirfnage there represented, and ex.
plained with fluency the meaning of the various
iymbols by w'hich the images were distinguished.
This may be confidered as a clear proof that
the fvftel of mythology now prevalent in
Benarcs, is not different from that delineated
in the caverns of Elephanta. Mr. Hunter,
who viiitcd Llephanta in the year 1784, seems
to confider the figures there as representing
deities who are still objecs of worflip
among the IIindoos r. One circumstance serves
to confirm the justness of this opinion. Several

oft

of the amofl conspicuous personages in the
groupes at Elephanta are decorated with the
Zennar, the sacred firing or cord peculiar to
the order of Brahmins, an authentic evidence
of the diftincion of cafis having been efta-
bliflied in India at the time when these works
were finished.

2. INSTEAD of caverns, the original places

of worship, which could be 'formed only in
particular situations, the devotion of the people
soon began to raise temples in honour of their
deities in other parts of India. "The firucture
of these was at firIt extremely simple. They
were pyramids of large dimension, and had no
light within but what came from a small door.
After having been long accustomed to perform
all the rites of religion in the gloom of caverns,
the Indians were naturally led to confider the
solemn darkness of such a mansion as sacred.
Some Pagodas in this firt stile of building itill
remain in Indofan. Drawings of two of there
at Deogur, and of a third near Tanjore in the
Carnatic, all fabrics of great antiquity, have
been publifled by Mr. I-odges , and though

3. IN proportion to the progress of the dif.

ferent countries of India in opulence and refine.
ment, the Itrudure of their temples gradually
improved. From plain buildings they became
highly ornamented fabrics, and, both by their
extent and magnificence, are monuments of
the power and tafite of the people by whom they
were erected. In this highly finiihed flile there
are pagodas of great antiquity in.different parts
of Indoftan, pafticularly in the :.outhern pro.

to assist my readers in. fming such an idea
of thee buildings as mayenable them to judge

I shall briefly describe two, of which we hake

another. Some of the ornamental parts are
finished with an elegance entitled to the admi-
ration of the most ingenious artists'. The Pa-
goda of Seringham, superior in fandity to that
of Chillambrum, surpasses it as much in gran-
deur; and, fortunately, I can convey a more
perfel idea of it by adopting the words of an
elegant and accurate historian. This Pagoda
is situated about a mile from the weflern ex-
tremity of the island of Seringham, formed by
the division of the great river Ca'veri into two
channels. " It is composed of seven square
" inclofures, one within the other, the walls
( of which are twenty-five feet high, and four
" thick. These inclofures are three hundred and
"fifty feet distant from one another, and each
"has four large gates with a high tower; which
"are placed, one in the middle of each fide
" of the inclofure, and opposite to the four
"cardinal points. The outward wall is near
" four miles in circumference, and its gateway
" to the South is ornamented with pillars, several
" of which are single flones thirty-three feet
"long, and nearly five in diameter; and those
"which form the roof are frill larger; in the
"inmost inclofures are the chapels. About

F" half a mile to the East of Seringham, and
" nearer to the Caveri than the Coleroon, is
" another large Pagoda, called Jembikifma; but
" this has only one inclofure. The extreme
" veneration in which Seringham is held,
" arises from a belief that it contains that iden-

tical image of the god Wiftchnu, which used
to be worshipped by the god Brahma. Pil.
' grims from all parts of the peninsula come here

to obtain absolution, and none come without

" an offering of money; and a large part of
" the revenue of the island is allotted for the
'; maintenance of the Brahmins who inhabit
"the Pagoda; and these, with their families,
c formerly composed a multitude not less than
" forty thousand fouls, maintained, without la-

hour, by the liberality of fuperfition. Here,
as in all the other great Pagodas of India,

lences and rocks formed by nature to be places
of strength. Of these the natives early took
poffeflion, and fortifying them with works of
various kinds, rendered them almoif impreg-
nable stations. There seems to have been, in
some distant age, a period of general turbu-
lence and danger in India, when such retreats
were deemed essentially necessary to public safety;
for among the duties of magifrates prescribed
by the Pundits, one is, " that he shall eret a
" strong fort in the place where he chufes to
" reside; and shall build a wall on all the four

fides of it, with towers and battlements, and

"' hall make a full ditch around it'." Of there
fortresses several remain, which, both from the
appearance of the buildings and from the tra-
dition of the natives, must have been con-
firuEted in very remote times. Mr. Hodges
has published views of three of these, one of
Chunar Gur, situated upon the river Ganges,
about sixteen miles above the city of Benaresm;
the second, of Gwallior, about eighty miles
to the south of Agra ; the third, of Bidjegur,
in the territory of Benares . They are all,
particularly Gwallior, works of considerable
magnitude and strength. The fortresses in Ben-

to be impregnableP; and I am aflured, by a
good judge, that Afleergur is indeed a most
itupendous work, and so advantageously fitua.

duce it by force. Adoni, of which Tippoo
Sultaun lately rendered himself matter, is not
inferior to any of them, either in strength or

NOR is it only from surveying their public

works that we are justified in asserting the early
proficiency of the Indians in elegant and useful
arts: we are led to form the fame conclusion by a
view of those producions of their ingenuity,
which were the chief articles of their trade
with foreign nations. Of these the labours of
the Indian loom and needle have, in every age,
been the most celebrated; and fine linen is con-
je&ured, with some probability, to have been
called by the ancients Sindon, from the name
of the river Indus or Sindus, near which it was
wrought in the highest perfeEtion r, The cot.

ton manufaAures of India seem anciently to
have been as much admired as they are at pre-
sent, not only for their delicate texture, but
for the elegance with which some of them are
embroidered, and the beautiful colour of the
flowers with which others are adorned. From
the earliest period of European intercourse with
India, that country has been .distinguished for
the number and excellence of the substances
for dying various colours, with which it abound-
ed S. The dye of the deep blue colour in
highest estimation among the Romans bore
the name of Indicumn'. From India too, the
substance used in dying a bright red colour,
seems to have been-imported"; and it is well
known that both in the cotton and silk fluffs
which we now-receive from India, the blue
and the red are the colours of most conspicuous
lustre and beauty. But however much the
ancients may have admired these producions
of Indian art, some circumstances, which I have
already mentioned, rendered their demand for
the cotton manufacures of India, far inferior
to that of modern times; and this has occasioned

the information concerning them which we
receive from the Greek and Roman writers to
be very imperfect. We may conclude, how.
ever, from the wonderful resemblance of the
ancient state of India to the modern, that, in
every period, the productions of their looms
were as various as beautiful. The ingenuity
of the Indians in other kinds of workmlanlihip,
particularly in metals and in ivory, is men.
tioned with praise by ancient authors, but with.
out any particular description of their nature x.
Of there early productions of Indian artists,
there are now some specimens in Europe,
from which it appears that they were acquainted
with the method of engraving upon the hardest
flones and gems; and, both in the elegance of
their designs and in neatness of execution, had
arrived at a considerable degree of excellence.
An ingenious'writer maintains, that the art of
engraving on gems was probably an Indian
invention, and certainly was early improved
there, and he supports this opinion by several
plausible arguments Y. The Indian engraved
gems, of which he has published descriptions,
appear to be the workmanflip of a very remote

BUT it is not alone from the improved state

of mechanic arts in India, that we conclude its
inhabitants to have been highly civilized; a
proof of this, still more convincing, may be
deduced from the early and extraordinary pro-
duations of their genius in the fine arts. '1his
cvidence is rendered more interefiing, by being
derived from a source of knowledge which the
laudable curiosity of our countrymen has opened
to the people of Europe within there few years.
That all the science and literature possessed by
the Brahmins, were contained in books written
in a language understood by a few only of the
most learned among them, is a faa which has
long been known; and all the Europeans fettled
in India during three centuries, have com-
plained that the Brahmins obstinately refused
to inftrua any person in this language. But
at length, by address, mild treatment, and a per-
fiafion, that the earnestness with which infrruc-
tion was solicited, proceeded not from any inten-
tion of turning their religion into derision, but
from a desire of acquiring a perfec knowledge
of their sciences and literature, the scruples of

the Brahmins have been overcome. Several
British gentlemen are n6w completely masters
of the Sanfkreet language. The myflerious
veil, formerly deemed impenetrable, is removed;
and, in the course of five years, the curiosity
of the public has been gratified by two pub.
lications as singular as they were unexpeced.
The one is a translation, by Mr. Wilkins, of an
Episode from the Mahabarat, an Epic poem, in
high etimation among the Hindoos, corn.
posed, according to their account, by Kreefhna
Dwypayen Veias, the most eminent of all their
Brahinins, above three thousand years before
the Christian aera. The other is Sacontala, a
dramatic poem, written about a century before
the birth of Christ, translated by Sir William
Jones. I {hall endeavonr to give my readers
such a view of the fubjedt and composition of
each of these, as may enable them to estimate,
in tome measure, the degree of merit which
they possess.

Tii- Mahabarat is a voluminous poem, con.

sising of upvx'ards of four hundred thousand
lines. Mr. Wilkins has translated more than a
third of it; but only a fhlort episode, intitled
Baghivat-Geta, is hitherto publifled, and from
this specimen we must form an opinion with
refpelt to the whole. 'The fubje of the poem
is a famous civil war between two branches of

* ( lthe

the royal house of Bhaurat. When the forces
on each fide were formed in the field, and
ready to decide the contefi by the sword, Arjoon,
the favourite and pupil of the god Kreefhna,
who accompanied him in this hour of danger,
requested of him to cause his chariot to advance
between the two hostile armies. He looked
at both armies, and beheld, on either fide, none
but grandsires, uncles, cousins, tutors, sons,
and brothers, near relations or bosom friends;
and when he had gazed for a while, and saw
these prepared for the fight, he was seized with
extreme pity and compuncion, and uttered his
sorrow in the following words:--" Having be-
"held, 0 KreeJhna ! my kindred thus waiting
" anxious for the fight, my members fail me,

my countenance withereth, the hair flandeth

"an end upon my body, and all my frame
" trembleth with horror; even Gandcev, my

bow, efcapeth from my hand, and my skin
"is parched and dried up.-When I have de-
" soyed my kindred, ihall I longer look for
" happiness ? I wish not for vitory, KrCcflJna;
" Iwant not dominion; I want not pleasure;
" for what is dominion and the enjoyments of
"life, or even life itself, when those for whom
"dominion, pleasure, and enjoyment were to
"be coveted, have abandoned life and fortune,
" and fland here in the field ready for the

" battle.

" battle. Tutors, sons, and fathers, grandfirel

and grandsons, uncles, nephews, cousins, kin:

" dred, and friends ! Although they would
" kill me, I wifil not to fight them, no not
" even for the dominion of the three regions
" of the univcrfe, much less fbr this little earth."
In order to remove his scruples, Kreeihna in.
forms hilm what was the duty of a prince of the
Chehtcree, or military cafr, when called to adt
in such a Situation, and incites him to perform
it by a variety of moral and philosophical ar-
guments, the nature of which I fiall have oc-
cafion to confider particularly in another part
of this Diflertation. In this dialogue between
Kreefhna and his pupil, there are several pas'
fages which give an high idea of the genius
of the poet. The ipeech of Arjoon I have
quoted, in which he exprefies the anguish
of his foul, muff have struck every reader
as beautiful and pathetic; and I shall afterwards
produce a description of the Supreme Being,
and of the reverence wherewith he should be
worihipped, which is sublime. But while there
excite our admiration, and confirm us in the
belief of a high degree of civilization in that
country where such a work was produced,
we are surprised at the defec of taste and of

array, eager for the fight; a:young hero and his
infirudor are described as flanding in a chariot
of war between them; that surely was not the
moment for teaching him the principles of phi-
lofophy, and delivering eighteen lectures of
metaphysics and theology.

WITH regards however; both to the dramatic
and epic poetry of the Hindoos, we labour
under the disadvantage of being obliged, to form
an opinion from a tingle fpecimien of each, and
that of the latter, too, (as it is only a part of
a large work,) an imperfec one. But if, from
such scanty materials, we may venture upon
any decision, it muff be, that of the two, the
drama seems to have been conduted with the
molt correCt taste. This will appear from
the observations which I now proceed to make
upon Sacontala.

IT is only to nations considerably advanced

in refinement, that the drama is a favourite en-
tertainment. The Greeks had been for a good
time a polished people; Alcsus and Sappho had,
composed their Odes, and Thales and Anaximan-
der had opened their fchools,before Tragedy made
it fitRf rude essay in the cart of' Thespis; and a

T good

good time elapsed before it attained to any
considerable degree of excellence. From the
drama of Sacontala, then, we muff form an ad.
vantageous idea of the slate of improvement
in that focietv to whose taste it was suited. In
eflinlating its merit, however, we must not
apply to it rules of criticism drawn from the
literature and taste of nations with which its
author was altogether unacquainted; we mult
not expect the unities of the Greek theatre;
we mull not meaftre it by our own flandard of
propriety. Allowance must be made for local
customs, and singular manners, arising froma
lrate of domestic society, an order of civil po-
licy, and a system of religious opinions, very
different from those established in Europe. Sa.
contala is not a regular drama, but, like tome
of the plays early exhibited on the Spanish and
Englihf theatres, is an hiflory in dialogue, un-
folding events which happened in different
places, and during a series of years. When
iewed in this light, the fable is in general well
arranged, many of the incidents are happily
chosen, and the viciflitudes in the situation of
the principal personages are sudden and unex-
pcd&d. The unravelling of the piece, how-
ever, though fIme of the circumstances prepa-
ratory to it be introduced with skill, is at last
brought about by the intervention of superior

14 beings,

beings, which has always a bad effec, and dif-
covers some want of art. But as Sacontala was
delcended of a celestial nymph, and under the
protection of a holy hermit, this heavenly inter-
position may appear less marvellous, and is
extremely agreeable to the Oriental taste. In
niany places of this drama it is simple and ten-
der, in some pathetic; in others there is a mix-
ture of comic with what is more serious. Of
each, examples might be given. I shall fele&t
a few of the first, both because simplicity and
tcndernefs are the charaEteriftic beauties of the
piece, and because they so little resemble the
extravagant imagery and turgid style confpi-
cuous in almofi all the specimens of Oriental
poetry which have hitherto been published.

FROM this specimen of the Indian drama,

every reader of good taste, I flould imagine,
will be satisfied, that it is only among a people
of polished manners and delicate sentiments
that a composition so simple and correct could
be produced or relished. I observe one ia-
ltance in this drama of that wvild extravagance
to frequent in ()rintal poetry. The monarch,
in replacing a bracelet which had dropped from
the arm ofSaccntala, tlu.s addrclefs her: " Iook,
"my darling, this is the new moon which left
"the firmament in honour of fupcrior beauIy,

praise is expected from the mouth of lovers.
Dramatic exhibitions seem to have been a fa-
vourite amusement of the Hindoos as well as of
other civilized nations. " The tragedies, co-
" medies, farces, and musical pieces of the In-

dian theatre, would fill as many volumes as
( that of any nation in ancient or modern Eu-
"rope. They are all in verse where the dia-
" logue is elevated, and in prose where it is
( familiar; the men of rank and learning are re-
" presented speaking pure Sanfkreet, and the
"women Pracrit, which is little more than the
"language of the Brahmins, melted down by a
" delicate articulation to the softness of Italian;
" while the low persons of the drama speak

V. THE attainments of the Indians in science,

furnish an additional proof of their early civiliza-
tion. By every person who has visited India
in ancient or modern times, its inhabitants,
either in tranfaftions of private business, or in
the conduct of political affairs, have been deemed
not inferior to the people of any nation in fa-
gacity or in acuteness of underllanding. From

the application of such talents to the cultivation
of feience, an extraordinary degree of,proficiency
might have been expected. The Indians were,
accordingly, early celebrated on that account,
and some of the most eminent of the Greek
philosophers travelled into India, that, by con.
versing with the fages of that country, they
might acquire some portion of the knowledge
for which they were diftinguifhede. The ac.
counts, however, which we receive from 'the
.Greeks and Romans, of the Sciences which
gttraaed the attention of the Indian philosophers,
or of the discoveries which they had made in
them, are very imperfec. To the researches of
a few intelligent perlous, who .have visited India
during the course of the three last centuries, we.are
indebtedfor more ample andauthentic information,
But from the reluctance with which the Brah-
mins communicate their sciences to strangers,
and the .inability of Europeans to acquire
mluch knowledge of them, wriile, like the m)yf.
teries of their religion, .they were concealed,from

with sufficient evidence upon which to found
a decisive judgment with refpet to either,

SCIENCE, when viewed as disjoined from re.

ligion, the consideration of which I reserve for
another head, is employed in contemplating
either the operations of the understanding, the
exercise of our moral powers, or the nature
and qualities of external objecs. The first is
.denominated logic; the second ethics; the third
physics, or the knowledge of nature. With
refped to the early progress in cultivating each
of these sciences in India, we are in poffeflion of
fads which merit attention.

BUT, prior to the consideration of them, it

is proper to examine the ideas of the Brahmins
with refped to mind itself, sor.is these were not
juat, all their theories concerning its operations
must have been erroneous and fanciful. The
diltinftion between matter and spirit appears
to have been early known by the philosop'hers
of India, and to the latter they ascribed marny
powers of which they deemed the former to
be incapable; and when we recolled how in-
adequate our conceptions are of every objec
that does not fall under the cognizance of the

12 senses,

senses, we may affirm (if allowance be made
for a peculiar notion of the Hindoos which shall
be afterwards explained) that no description
of the. human foul is more suited to the dignity
of its nature than that given by the author of
the Mahabarat. " Some," fays he, " regard the
" foul as a wonder, others hear of it with aftoniffh
" ment, but no one knoweth it. The weapon di-
' videth it not; the fire burneth it not; the water
"corrupteth it not; the wind drieth it not away;

for it is indivifiblc, inconfumabie,incorruptible;
' it is ercrnal, universal, permanent, immovable;

it is invisible, inconceivable, and unalter-

" able ." After this view of the sentiments
f the Brahmins concerning mind itself, we may
proceed to confider their ideas with refpet to
each of the sciences, in that tripartite arrange-
Inent which I mentioned.

form arrangements of fciencc. The philo-
fophers of ancient Greece were highly celebrated
for their proficiency in there abstruse fpecula.
tions; and in their difcuflions and arrangements,
discovered such depth of thought and acute-
ness of discernment, that their fvitems of Logic,
particularly that of the Peripatetic School,
have been deemed most distinguished efforts of
human reason.

BUT since we became acquainted, in some

degrce, with the literature and science of the
Hlindoos, we find that as soon as men arrive
at that stage in social life, when they can turn
their attention to speculative inquiries, the hu-
man mind will, in every region of the earth,
display nearly the fame powers, and proceed
in its invcftigations and discoveries by nearly
Ifiilar steps. From Abul Fazel's compendium

many paflages in the Baghvat-Geeta, it appears
that the fame fIeculations which occupied the
philosophers of Greece had engaged the attention
of the Indian Brahmins; and the theories of
the former, either concerning the qualities of
external objecs, or the nature of our own ideas,
were not more ingenious than thole of the latter.
To define with accuracy, to diffinguiflh with
acuteness, and to reason with subtlety, are cha.
ra&eriftics of both; and in both, the fame ex.
cess of refinement, in attempting to analyse those
operations of mind which the faculties of man
were not formed to comprehend, led sometimes
to the most false and dangerous conclusions,
That sceptical philosophy, which denies the
existence of the material world, and asserts no.
thing to be real but our own ideas, seems to
have been known in India as well as in Europe';
and the fages of the East, as they were indebted
to philosophy for the knowledge of many im-
portant truths, were not more exempt than those
of the Weft from its delusions and errors.

the conduct of life, as it is of all other the most

with refpet to these points were various, and,
like the philosophers of Greece, the Brahmins
were divided into sets, diflinguifhed by maxims
and tenets often diametrically opposite. That
fee with whose opinions we are, fortunately,
belt acquainted, had established a fyfeiem of
morals, founded on principles the most generous
and dignified which unassisted reason is capable
of discovering. Man, they taught, was formed,
not for speculation or indolence, but for action.
lHe is born, not for himself alone, but for his fel-
low men. The happiness of the society of which
he is a member, the good of mankind, are his
ultimate and highell objects. In chufing what
to prefer or to reje&, the justness and propriety.
of his own choice are the only considerations to.
which he should attend. The events which
may follow his aAions are not in his own power,
and whether they be prosperous or adverse, as
long as he is satisfied with the purity of the
motives which induced him to aft, he can enjoy
that approbation of his own mind, which con-
ftitutes genuine happiness, independent of thc
power of fortune or the opinions of other men.

FROMI these and other passages which I might

have quoted, we learn that the diltinguifhing
doctrines of the Stoical school were taught
in India many ages before the birth of Zeno,
and inculcated with a persuasive earnestness
nearly resembling that of Epidetus; and it is
not without astonishment that we find the tenets
of this manly active philosophy, which seem
to be formed only for men of the most vigorous
spirit, prescribed as the rule of conduEt to a race
of people more eminent (as is generally supposed)
for the gentleness of their disposition than for the
elevation of their minds.

3d, Pi)hsics. In all the sciences which

contribute towards extending our knowledge
of nature, in mathematics, mechanics, and aftro-

idepending

depending upon it have attained a, superior de.
gree of perfection. Such improvement of this
science we find in India. While, among the.
Greeks and Romans, the only method used for
the notation of numbers was by the letters of
the alphabet, which necessarily rendered arith,
metical calculation extremely tedious and ope-
rose, the Indians had, from time immemorial,
employed for the fame purpose the ten cyphers,
or figures, now universally known, and by means
of them performed every operation in arithmetic
with the greatest facility and expedition. By
the happy invention of giving a different value
to each figure according to its change of places
no more than ten figures are needed in calcula-
tions the most complex, and of any given extent;.
and arithmetic is the moll perfec of all the
sciences. The Arabians, not long after their
Settlement in Spain, introduced this mode of
notation into Europe, and were candid enough
to acknowledge that they had derived the know.
ledge of it from the Indians. Though the ad-
vantages of this mode of notation are obvious
and great, yet so slowly do mankind adopt
new inventions, that the use of it was for some
time confined to fcicice; by degrees, howevec',
men of bufincfs relinquished the former cum-
berfome method of computation by letters, and

the

the Indian arithmetic came into general use
throughout Europe'. It is now so familiar and
simple, that the ingenuity of the people, to whom
we are indebted for the invention, is less observed
and less celebrated than it merits.

THE astronomy of the Indians is a proof

fiill more conspicuous of their extraordinary
progress in science. The attention and success
with which they studied the motions of the
heavenly bodies were so little known to the
Greeks and Romans, that it is hardly mentioned.
by them but in the molt cursory manner ". But
as soon as the Mahomedans established an in-
tercourfe with, the natives of India, they obA
served and celebrated the superiority of their
agtronomical knowledge. Of the Europeans
who visited India after the communication with
it by the Cape of Good Hope ws- discovered,
M. Bernier, an inquisitive and philosophical
traveller, was one of the first who learned that
the Indians, had long applied to the Itudy of
astronomy, and had made considerable progress
in that science . His information, ahowever,
seems to have been very general and imperfect.

We are indebted for the Trft scientific proof
of the great proficiency of the Indians in aftro.
nomical knowledge, to M. de la Loubere, who,
A. D. 1687. on h.s (rturn from his embassy to Siam, brought

with him an extract from a Siamese manuscript,
which contained tables and rules for calculating
the places of the fun and moon. The manner
in which there tables were conftruaed rendered
the principles on which they were founded
extremely obscure, and it required a commenta-
tor as conversant in astronomical calculation as
the celebrated Cassini, to explain the meaning
of this curious fragment. The epoch of the
Siamese tables corresponds to the 21ft of March,
A. D. 638. Another set of tables was tranf-
mitted from Chrifnabouram, in the Carnatic,
the epoch of which answers to the oth of
March, A. D. I49 . A third set of tables came
from Narfapour, and the epoch of them goes
no farther back than A. D. I569. The fourth
and most curious set of tables was published
by M. le Gentil, to whom they were communi-
cated by a learned Brahmin of Tirvalore, a
small town on the Coromandel coast, about
twelve mniles weft of Negapatam. The
epoch of there tables is (cf high antiquity, and
coincides with the beginning of the celebrated
aera of the Calyoughan or Collee Jogue, which
commecnced, accorlinig to the Indian account,

three

ihree thousand one hundred and two years before
the birth of Christ P.

THESE four sets of tables have been examined

and compared by M. Bailly, who with singular
felicity of genius has conjoined an uncommon
degree of eloquence with the patient researches
of an astronomer, and the profound inveffigations
of a geometrician. His calculations have been
verified, and his reasonings have been illus-
trated and extended by Mr. Playfair, in a very
masterly Dissertation, published in the Tranf-
actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh q.

INSTEAD of attempting to follow them in

reasonings and calculations, which, from their
nature, are often abstruse and intricate, I shall
Satisfy myself with giving such a general view
of them as is suited to a popular work. This,
I hope, may convey a proper idea of what has
been published concerning the astronomy of
India, a IubjeE too curious and important to
be omitted in any account of the ifate of science
in that country; and, without interposing any
judgment of my own, I shall leave each of my
readers to form his own opinion.

Sec NOTE LXVII. q Vul.ii. p. 135.

u 2 IT

IT may be confidered as the general result of

all the inquiries, reasonings, and calculations,
with refpet to Indian astronomy, which have
hitherto been made public, " That the motion
c of the heavenly bodies, and more particularly
" their situation at the commencement of the
" different epochs to which the four sets of
" tables refer, are ascertained with great accu.
"racy; and that many of the elements of their
" calculations, especially for very remote ages,
" are verified by an astonishing coincidence
" with the tables of the modern astronomy of

Europe, when improved by the latest and

" mofi nice dedutions from the theory of gra.
" vitation." These conclusions are rendered
peculiarly interesting, by the evidence which
they afford of an advancement in science un-
exampled in the history of rude nations. The
Indian Brahmins, who annually circulate a kind
of almanac, containing astronomical predicions
of some of the more remarkable phenomena in
the heavens,- ilch as the new and full moons,
the eclipses of the fun and moon, are in pof-
feflion of certain methods of calculation, which,
upon examination, are found to involve in them
a very extensive fyftcm of aifronomical know-
ledge. M. le Gentil, a French astronomer,
had an opportunity, while in India, of observing

S tw.ot

-two eclipses of the moon which had been cal-
culated by a Brahmin, and he found the error
in either to be very inconsiderable.

THE accuracy of these results is less surprising

than the jufinefs and Icientific nature of the prin-
ciples on which the tables, by which they cal-
culate, are conftruced For the method of
predicting eclipses which is followed by the
Brahmins, is of a kind altogether different from
any that has been found in the poffeflion of rude
nations in the infancy of altronomy. In Chaldaa,
and even in Greece, in the early ages, the me-
thod of calculating eclipses was founded on the
obServation of a certain period or cycle, after
which the eclipses of the fun and moon return
nearly in the fame order; but there was no
attempt to analyse the different circumstances on
which the cclipfe depends, or to deduce its-phe.
nonmena from a precise knowledge of the motions
of the fun and moon. This last was reserved for
a more advanced period, when geometry, as well
as arithmetic, were called in to the afliftance of
astronomy, and if it was attempted at all, seems
not to have been attempted with success before
the age of Hipparchus. It is a method of this
superior kind, founded on principles and on
an analysis of the motions of the fun and moon,
which guides the calculations of the Brahmnins,

u 3 and

and they never employ any of the grosser eftimar
tions, which were the pride of the first aftrono,
mers in Egypt and Chaldaa.

THE Brahmins of the present times are guided

in their calculations by these principles, though
they do not now undertand them ; they know
only the use of the tables which are in their
polieffion, but are unacquainted with the me-
thod of their construCtion. The Brahmin who
visited M. le Gentil at Pondicherry, and in.
firueted him in the use of the Indian tables,
had no knowledge of the principles of his art,
and discovered no curiosity concerning the
nature of M. le Gentil's observations, or about
the instruments which he employed. He was
equally ignorant with refpeft to the authors of
these tables: and whatever is to be learnt
concerning the time or place of their con.
ftrudion, must be deduced from the tables them-
selves. One set of there tables (as was formerly
cbfervcd) profess to be as old as the beginning
of lihe Calyougham, or to go back to the year
3 o2 before the Chriflian era; but as nothing
(it may be supposed) is easier than for an aftro-
nomer to give to his tables what date he pleases,
and, by calculating backwards, to establish an
epoch of any afligned antiquity, the preten-
sions of the Indian astronomy to so remote an

origfin

origin are not to be admitted without exami-
nation.

THAT examination has accordingly been in.

flituted by M. Bailly, and the result of his in-
quiries is aflerted to be, that the afironomy
of India is founded on observations which can-
not be of a much later date than the period
above mentioned. For the Indian tables re-
present the slate of the heavens at that period
with astonishing exaftnefs; and there is be-
tween them and the calculations of our mo-
dern astronomy such a conformity, with respect
to those ages, as could result from nothing, but
from the authors of the former having accurately
copied from nature, and having delineated truly
the face of the'heavens, in the age wherein they
lived. In order to give some idea of the high
degree of accuracy in the Indian tables, I shall
feledt a few instances of it, out of many that
might be produced. The place of the fun for
the afronomical epoch at the beginning of
the Calyougham, as fated in the tables of Tir-
valore, is only forty-feven minutes greater than
by the tables of M. de la Caille, when cor-
rcted by the calculations of M. de la Grange.
The place of the moon, in the fame tables,
for the fame epoch, is only thirty-feven mi-
nutes different from the tables of Mayer. The

u 4 tables

tables of Ptolemy, for that epoch, are erroneous
no less than ten degrees with refpet to the
place of the fun, and eleven degrees with re-
fpea to that of the moon. The acceleration
of the moon's motion, reckoning from the
beginning of the Calyougham to the present
time, agrees, iq the Indian tables, with those
of Mayer to a single minute. The inequality
of the fun's motion, and the obliquity of the
ecliptic, which were both greater in former
ages than they are now, as represented in the
tables of Tirvalore, are almost of the precise
quantity that the theory of gravitation assigns
to them three thousand years before the Chris.
taan era. It is accordingly for those very re.
mote ages (about 5000 years distant from the
present) that their afRonomy is moi - accu.
rate, and the nearer 'we come down to
our own times, the conformity of its results
with ours diminishes, It fIems reasonable to
suppose, that the time when it- rules are most
accurate, is the time when the observations wcre
made on which there rules are founded.

IN support of this conclusion, M. Bailly main-

tains that none of all the astronomical fyfteims
of Greece or Persia, or of Tartary, from tome
of which it might bp fulpe&ed that the Indian
tables were copied, can bc made to agree with

them,

them, especially when we calculate for very
remote ages. The superior perfestion of the
Indian tables becomes always more conspicuous
as we go farther back into antiquity. This
/hews, likewise, how difficult it is to conffruc
any astronomical tables, which will agree with
the [late of the heavens for a period so remote
fromn the time when the tables were conftruted,
as four or five thousand years. It is only frofn
astronomy in its most advanced state, such as
it has attained in modern Europe, that such
accuracy is to be expected.

WHEN an estimate is endeavoured to be

made of the geometrical fill necessary for the
conftrution of the Indian tables and rules, it is
found to be very considerable; and, beside the
knowledge of elementary geometry, it mufi
have required plain and spherical trigonometry,
or Something equivalent to them, together with
certain methods of approximating to the values
of geometrical magnitudes, which seem to rife
very far above the elements of any of those
fcienccs. Some of these laflt mark also very
clearly (although this has not been observed by
M. Bailly) that the places to which there tables
are adapted, muff be situated between the Tro.
pics, because they are altogether inapplicable at
a greater distance from the Equator.

FROM

FROMI, this long induction, the conclusion

which seems obviously to result is, that the In,
dian astronomy is founded upon obiervations
which were made at a very early period; and
when we confider the exa&t agreement of the
places which they assign to the fun and moon,
and other heavenly bodies, at that epoch, with
those deduced from the tables of De la Caille
and Mayer, it firongly confirms the truth of
the position which I have been endeavouring
to eflablifh, concerning the early and high slate
of civilization in India.

BEFORE I quit this fubje&, there is one cir-

cumflance which merits particular attention,
All the knowledge which we have hitherto
acquired of the principles and conclusions of
Indian astronomy is derived frpn the southern
part of the Carnatic, and the tables are adapted
to places situated between the meridian of Cape
Comorin and that which pafles through the

from time immemorial the Athens of India, the

the Brahmins has been so far gained as to render
them communicative; some of our countrymen
are acquainted with that sacred language in which
the mysteries both of religion and of science are
recorded; movement and activity has been
given to a spirit of inquiry throughout all the
British establishments in India; persons who
visited that country with other views, though
engaged in occupations of a very different kind,
are now carrying on scientific and literary re-
searches with ardour and success. Nothing
seems now to be wanting but that those en-
trusted with the administration of the British
empire in India, ihould enable some person,
capable, by his talents and liberality of sentiment,
of investigating and explaining the more abstruse
parts of Indian philosophy, to devote his whole
time to that important object. Thus Great
Britain may have the glory of exploring fully
that extensive field of unknown science, which
the Academicians of France had the merit of
first opening to the people of Europe ".

of the early and high civilization of the ancient
Indians, is deduced from the consideration
of their religious tenets and praftices. The

inltitu-

institutions of religion, publicly ellablifhed in
all the extensive countries stretching from the
banks of the Indus to Cape Comorin, present
to view an afpedt nearly similar. They form
a regular and complete system of superstition,
flrengthened and upheld by every thing
which can excite the reverence and secure
the attachment of the people. The temples,
consecrated to their deities, are magnificent,
and adorned not only with rich offerings,
but with the most exquisite works in paint-
ing and sculpture, which the artists, highest
in estimation among them, were capable of
executing. The rites and ceremonies of their
worship are pompous and splendid, and the per.
formance of them not only mingles in all the
more momentous tranfaEtions of common life,
but constitutes an essential part of them. The
Brahmins, who, as ministers of religion, preside
in all its functions, are elevated above every
other order of men, by an origin deemed not
only more noble, but acknowledged to be fa..
cred. They have elfablifled among themselves
a regular hierarchy and gradation of ranks,
which, by securing subordination in their own
order, adds weight to their authority, and gives
them a more absolute dominion over the minds
of the people. This dominion they support
by the command of, the immense revenues with

which

which the liberality of princes, and the zeal
of pilgrims and devotees, have enriched their
pagodas x.

IT is far fiom my intention to enter into any

minute detail with refpet to this vast and con.
plicated fyltem of fuperflition. An attempt
to enumerate the multitude of deities which
are the objeEts of adoration in India; to de.
scribe the splendour of worship in their Pagodas,
and the immense variety of their rites and ce-
remonies; to recount the various attributes and
funEtions which the craft of priests, or the cre,
dulity of the people, have ascribed to their di-
vinities; especially if I were to accompany all
this with a review of the numerous and
often fanciful speculations and theories of
learned men on this subjet, would require a
work of great magnitude. I fall, therefore,
on this, as on some of the former heads, confine
myself to the precise point which I have kept
uniformly in view, and by confidering the slate
of religion in India, I {hall endeavour not only
to throw additional light on the lRate of civiliza-

history and progress of superstition and false
religion in every region of the earth.

I. We may observe, that, in every country,

the received mythology, or fyflem of super-
ftitious belief, with all the rites and ceremonies
which it prescribes, is formed in the infancy
of society, in rude and barbarous times. True
religion is as different from superstition in its
origin, as in its nature. The former is the
offspring of reason cherished by science, and
attains to its highest perfection in ages of light
and improvement. Ignorance and fear give
birth to the latter, and it is always in the darkest
periods that it acquires the greatest vigour.
That numerous part of the human species whose
lot is labour, whose principal and almost sole
occupation is to secure subsistence, has neither
leisure nor capacity for entering into that path
of intricate and refined speculation, which con-
duds to the knowledge of the principles of
rational religion. When the intellecual powers
are just beginning to unfold, and their firtf feeble
exertions are directed towards a few objets of
primary neceflity and use; when the faculties
of the mind are so limited as not to have formed
general and abitralt ideas; when language is so
barren as to be destitute of names to distinguish

4 any

any thing not perceivable by some of the senses;
it is prepoflerous to expeA that men ihould be
capable of tracing the relation between effects
and their causes; or to suppose that they should
rife from the contemplation of the former to
the discovery of the latter, and form just con.
ceptions of one Supreme Being, as the Creator
and Governor of the universe. The idea of
creation is so familiar, wherever the mixid is
enlarged by science, and illuminated by re.
velation, that we seldom refleCt how profound
and abstruse the idea is, or confider what pro.
grefs man must have made in observation and
research, before he could arrive at any diflind
knowledge of this elementary principle in re.
ligion. But even in its rude state, the human
mind, formed for religion, opens to the re-
ception of ideas, which are destined, when cor-
reEted and refined, ;to be the great source of
consolation atnidfl the calamities of life. These
apprehensions, however, are originally indif-
tinct and perplexed, and seem to be suggested
rather by the dread of impending evils, than
to flow from gratitude for bleflings received.
While nature holds on her course with uniform
and undilturbed regularity, men enjoy the be.
nefits resulting from it, without much inquiry
concerning its caufc. But every deviation from

this

this regular courre rouses and aftonihes them.
When they belTold events to which they are
not accustomed, they search for the caufcs of
them with eager curiosity, Their underflanding
is often unable to discover these, but imagina-
tion, a mote forward and .irdent faculty of the
mind, decides without hesitation. It ascribes
the extraordinary occurrences in nature to the
influence of invisible beings, and iupp'.)es the
thunder, the hurricane, and the earthquake, to
be the immediate effet of theit agency. Alarmed
by these natural evils, and exposed, at the fame
time, to many dangers and disasters, which are
unavoidable in the early and uncivilized slate
of society, men have recourse for proteCtion
to power superior to what is human, and the
firfl rites or practices which bear any refemn
blance to aas of religion, have it for their ob-
jed to avert evils which they susser or dread x,

conceive an idea of one superintending mind,
capable of arranging and direaing all the va-
rious operations of nature, seems to be an at-
tainment far beyond the powers of man in the
more early flages of his progress. His theories,
more suited to the limited sphere of his own
observation, are not so refined. He supposes
that there is a diftint cause of every remarkable
effe&, and ascribes to a separate power every
event which attracts his attention, or excites
his terror. He fancies that it is the province
of one deity to point the lightning, and, with
an awful found, to hurl the irresistible thunder.
bolt at the head of the guilty; that another
rides in the whirlwind, and, at his pleasure,
raises or stills the tempest; that a third rules
over the ocean; that a fourth is the god of
battles; that, while malevolent powers scat-
ter the feeds of animosity and discord, and kindle
in the breast those angry paflions which give
rife to war, and terminate in deftrudion, others,
of a nature more benign, by inspiring the hearts
of men with kindness and love, strengthen the
bonds of social union, augment the happiness,
and increase the number of the human race.

W1THro T; descending farther into detail, or
attcmpting to enumerate that infinite multitude

of

of deities to which the fancy or the fears of
men have allotted the diretion of the several
departments in nature, we may recognise a
firiking uniformity of features in the systems
of fuperitition eflablifhed throughout every part
of the earth. The less men have advanced
beyond the itate of savage life, and the more
slender their acquaintance with the operations
of nature, the fewer were their deities in num-
ber, and the more compendious was their theo-
logical creed; but as their mind gradually
opened, and their knowledge continued to ex-
tend, the objecs of their veneration multiplied,
and the articles of their faith became more nu-
merous. This took place remarkably among
the Greeks in Europe, and the Indians in Asia,
the two people in those great divisions of the
earth, who were most early civilized, and to
whom, for that reason, I shall confine all my
observations. They believed, that over every
movement in the natural world, and over every
funation in civil or domestic life, even the most
common and trivial, a particular deity presided.
The manner in which they arranged the fla-
tions of thele superintending powers, and the
offices which they allotted to each, were in
many rLdi')ets the fame. What is supposed to
be performled by the power of Jupiter, of Nep-
tunc, of JEolus, of Mars, of Venus, according
to the mythology of the VTWet, is ascribed in the

x 2 East

East to the agency of Agnee, the god of fire;
Varoon, the god of oceans; Vayoo, the god
of wind Y; Cama, the god of love; and a va-
riety of other divinities.

THE ignorance and credulity of men having

thus peopled the heavens with imaginary beings,
they ascribed to them such qualities and aEtions
as they deemed suitable to their character and
functions. It is one of the benefits derived
from true religion, that by setting before men
a flandurd of perseEt excellence, which they
should have always in their eye, and endeavour
to resemble, it may be said to bring down virtue
from heaven to earth, and to form the human
mind after a divine model. In fabricating sys-
tems of false religion, the procedure is direftly
the reverse. Men ascribe to the beings whom
they have deified, such actions as they them-
selves admire and celebrate. The qualities of
the gods who are the objects of adoration, are
copied from those of the worshippers who bow
down before them; and thus many of the im-
perfections peculiar. to men, have found admit-
tance into heaven. By knowing the adven-
tures and attributes of any false deity, we can
pronounce, with some degree of certainty, what
mul(t have been the slate of society and manners

when he was elevated to that dignity. The
mythology of Greece plainly indicates the cha-
racter of the age in which it was formed. It
inuf( have been in times of the greatest licentious-
ness, anarchy, and violence, that divinities of
the highest rank could be supposed capable of
perpetrating afions, or of being influenced by
palTions, which, in more enlightened periods,
wouldlbe deemed a difgracc to human nature;
it muff have been when the earth was fill in-
ifed with deftrudive monsters, and mankind,
under forms of government too feeble to afford
them proteEion, were exposed to the depreda-
tions of lawless robbers, or the cruelty of savage
oppressors, that the Xwell known labours of
Hercules, by which he was raised from earth
to heaven, could have been necessary, or would
have been deemed so highly meritorious. The
lame observation is applicable to the ancient
mythology of India. Many of the adventures
and exploits of the Indian deities are suited to
the rudcft ages of turbulence and rapine. It
was to check disorder, to redress wrongs, and
to clear the earth of powerful opprcflors, that
Vilfnou, a divinity of the highelf order, is said
to have become fucceifively incarnate, and to
have appeared on earth in various sorns Z.

III. THE character and funtions of those

deities which superstition created to itself as ob-
jets of its veneration, having everywhere a near
resemblance, the rites of their worship were
ever)where extremely similar. Accordingly, as
deities were distinguished, either by ferocity of
charaEter or licentiousness of conduct, it is ob-
vious what services must have been deemed moti
acceptable to them. In order to conciliate the
favour, or to appease the wrath, of the former,
fasts, mortifications, and penances, all rigid, and
many of them excruciating to an extreme degree,
were the means employed. Their altars were
always bathed in blood, the most costly victims
were offered, whole hecatombs were slaughtered,
even human sacrifices were not unknown, and
were held to be the most powerful expiations.
In order to gain the good-will of the deities of
the latter description, recourse was had to in-
ltitutions of a very different kind, to splendid
ceremonies, gay festivals, heightened by all the
pleasures of poetry, music, and dancing, but
often terminating in scenes of indulgence too
indecent to be describcd. Of both these, in-
Itances occur in the rites of Greek and Roman
wolfhip, which I need not mention to my learned
readers . In the East the ceremonial of super-

itition is nearly the fame. The manners of the
Indians, though distinguished, from the time
when they became known to the people of the
Weft, for mildness, seem, in a more remote
period, to have been in a greater degree similar
to those of other nations. Several of their
deities were fierce and awful in their nature,
and were represented in their temples under the
moRl terrific forms. If we did not know the
dominion of fuperftiton over the human mind,
we should hardly believe, that a ritual of worship
suited to the character of such deities could have
been established among a gentle people. Every
at of religion, performed in honour of some
of their gods, seems to have been prescribed by
fear. Mortifications and penances, so rigorous,
so painful, and so long continued, that we read
the accounts of them with astonishment and
horror, were multiplied. Repugnant as it is
to the feelings of an Hindoo, to shed the blood
of any creature that has life, many different ani-
mals, even the most useful, the horse and the cow,
were offered up as vitims upon the altars of
some of their godsb; and what is tfill more
strange, the Pagodas of the East were polluted
witll human sacrifices, as well as the temples of

sure. In no part of the earth was a conneaiorn
between the gratification of sensual desire and
the rites of public religion, displayed with more
avowed indecency than in India. In every Pa,
goda there was a band of women set apart for
the service of the idol honoured there, and de,
voted from their early years to a life of pleasure;
for which the Brahmins prepared them by an
education which added so many elegant accom,
plifhnlents to their natural charms, that what
they gainied by their profligacy, often brought
no inconsiderable accession to the revenue of the
temple. In every function performed in the
Pagodas, .as well as in every public proceflion,
it is the office of these women to dance before
the idol, and to sing hymns in his praise; and it
is diflicuft to fay, whether they trespass moil
against decency by the geflures they exhibit,
or by the verses which they recite, The walls
of the Pagoda are covered with paintings, in

may be which superstition has adopted, or how
unhallowed the rites which it prescribes, the
former are received in every age and country
with unhesitating assent, by the great body of
the people, and the latter observed with fcru-
pulous exaciefs. In our reasonings concern-
ing religious opinions and pradtices which differ
widely from our own, we are extremely apt to
err, Having been infrruted ourselves in the
principles of a religion, worthy in every refped
of that divine wisdom by which they were dic-
tated, we frequently express wonder at the cre-
dulity of nations in embracing systems of belief
which appear to us so directly repugnant to right
reason, and iometimes fufpec that tenets so wild
and extravagant do not really gain credit with
them. 3But experience may satisfy us, that

neither

neither our wonder nor suspicions are well
founded. No article of the public religion was
called in queflion by those people of ancient
Europe, with whose history we are best acquainted,
and no pratice which it enjoined appeared im,
proper to them. On the other hand, every
opinion that tended to diminish the reverence
of men for the gods of their country, or to
alienate them from their worship, excited among
the Greeks and Romans that indignant zeal
which is natural to every people attached to
their religion, by a firm persuasion of its truth.
The attachment of the Indians, both in ancient
and modern times, to the tenets and rites of
their ancestors, has been, if poflible, fiill greater.
In no country, of which we have any account,
were precautions taken with so much solicitude,
to place the great body of the people beyond
the reach of any temptation to doubt or dif-
belief. They not only were prevented, (as I
have already observed the great bulk of man-
kind must always be in every country,) from
enlering upon any Spcculative inquiry, by the
various occupations of active and laborious
life, but any attempt to extend the sphere of
their knolcedge was cxprcfsly prohibited. If
one of the Sooder c;:fl, by tar the most numerous
of the four into which the whole nation was
divided, presumcd to read any portion of the

4 sacred

jacred books, in which all the science known
in India is contained, he was severely punimhed;
if he ventured to get it by heart, he was put
to death . To aspire after any higher degree
of knowledge than the Brahmins have been
pleased to teach, would be deemed not only
presumption but impiety. Even the higher
Cats depended entirely for inftrution on the
Brahmins, and could acquire no portion of
science but what they deigned to communicate.
By means of this, a devout reverence was uni-
verfally maintained for those inftiturions which
were confidered' as sacred; and, though the
faith of the Hindoos has been often tried by
severe persecutions, excited by the bigotry of
their Mahomedan conquerors, no people ever
adhered with greater fidelity to the tenets and
rites of their ancestors g

V. WE may observe, that when science and

philosophy are diffused through any country,
the system of superstition is fubjeeted to a fcru-
tiny from which it was formerly exempt, and
opinions spread which imperceptibly diminish
its influence over the minds of nmen. A free
and full examination is always favourable to

truth,

truth, but fatal to error. What is received with
implicit faith in ages of darkness, will excite con.
tempt or indignation in an enlightened period.
The hiflory of religion in Greece and Italy,
the only countries of Europe which, in ancient
times, were diltinguifhed for their attainments
in science, confirms the truth of this observation.
As soon as science made such progress in Greece
as rendered men capable of discerning the wis.
dom, the foresight, and the goodness displayed
in creating, preserving, and governing the world,
they must have perceived, that the characters
of the divinities which were proposed as the
objects of adoration in their temples, could not
entitle them to be confidered as the presiding
powers in nature. A poet might address Ju-
piter as the father of gods and men, who go-
verned both by eternal laws; but, to a philofo-
pher, the son of Saturn, the flory of whose life
is a series of violent and licentious deeds, which
would render any man odious or dcfpicable,
muff have appeared altogether unworthy of
that flation. Tlhe nature of the religious ser.
vice celebrated in their temples must have been
no less oflenfive to an enlightened mind, than
the character of the deities in honour of whom
it was performed. Inltead of inflitutions, tend.
ing to reclaim men fiom vice, to form or to
fircengthcn habits of virtue, or to elevate the

nind

mind to a sense of its proper dignity, fuperlition
either occupied its votaries in frivolous unmean-
ing ceremonies, or prescribed rites, which ope-
rated, with fatal influence, in inflaming the pas-
sions and corrupting the heart.

IT is with timidity, however, and caution,

that men venture to attack the established re-
ligion of their country, or to impugn opinions
which have been long held sacred. At first,
son;e philosophers endeavoured, by allegorical
interpretations and refined comments, to ex-
plain the popular mythology, as if it had been
a description of the powers of nature, and of the
various events and revolutions which take place
in the system of the material world, and en-
deavoured, by this expedient, to palliate many
of its absurdities. By degrees, bolder theories
concerning religion were admitted into the
schools of science. Philosophers of enlarged
views, sensible of the impiety of the popular
fuperltition, formed ideas concerning the per-
fedions of one Supreme Being, the Creator and
Ruler of the universe, as jult and rational as
have ever been attained by the unaflifed powers
of the human mind.

Ir from Europe we now turn to Asia, we
flaltl tind, that the observation which I have

5 llmade

made upon the history of false religion holds
equally true there. In India as vell as in Greece,
it was by cultivating science that men were
firfl led to examine and to entertain doubts with
refpeA to the efiablifhed systems of fuperilition;
and when wve confider the great difference be-
tween the ecclesiastical conflitution (if I may
use thar exprcTion) of the two countries, we are
apt to imagine that the eftablified system lay
more open to examination in the latter than in
the former. In Greece there was not any dif-
tind race or order of men set apart for per-
forming the functions of religion, or to serve
as hereditary and intercited guardians of its
tenets and inititutions. But in India the Brah-
mins wcre born the ministers of religion, and
they had an exclusive right of presiding in all
the numerous rites of worship which fuperitition
prescribed as necelfary to avert the wrath of
Heaven, or to render it propitious. These
diftin&tion. and privileges secured to them a
wonderful ascendant over their countrymen;
and every consideration that can influence the
human mind, the honour, the interest, the power
of their order, called upon them to support the
tenets, and to maintain the inflitutions and
rites, with which the preservation of this as-
cendant was so intimately conneAed.

BUT

BUT as the most eminent persons of the'Caft

devoted their lives to' the cultivation of science,
the progress which they made in all the branches
of it (of which I have given fonle account)
was great, and enabled them to form such a
jus idea of the system of nature; and of the
power, wisdom, and goodnifs displayed in the
formation and government of it, as elevated their
minds above the popular superstition, and led
them to acknowledge and reverence one Su-
preme Being, " the Creator of all things (to
" use their own expreflions), and from whom
ic all things proceed h."

THIS is the idea which Abul Fazel, who ex-

amined the opinions of the Brahmins with the
greatest attention and candour, gives of their
theology. " They all,", fays he, "' believe in
" the unity of the Godhead, and although they
"hold images in high veneration, it is only
" because they represent celestial beings, and
"prevent the thoughts of those who worship
"them from wandering i." The sentiments
of the most intelligent Europeans who have
visited India, coincide perfectly with his, in re-
fpcl to this point. The accounts which Mr.
Bernier received from the Pundits of Benares,

both

both of their external worship, and of one So,
vereign Lord being the sole objeE of their devo.
tion, is precisely the fame with that given by
Abul Fazel k. Mr. Wilkins, better qualified
perhaps than any European ever was to judge
with refpeEt to this subjet, represents the learned
Brahmins of the present times as Theists, be.
lievers in the unity of God'. Of the fame opi.
nion is M. Sonnerat, who resided in India seven
years, in order to inquire into the manners,
sciences, and religion of the Hindoos m. The
Pundits, who translated the Code of Gentoo
Laws, declare, " that it was the Supreme Being,
c who, by his power, formed all creatures of the
"animal, vegetable, and material wo'il, from
" the four elements of fire, water, ai, and earth,
" to be an or Lament to the magazine of creation;
" and whose comprehensive benevolence fcleEed
" man, the center of knowledge, to have do-
" minion and authority over the reft; and,
(' having beflowed upon this favourite objedl
"judgment and underflanding, gave him fuprc-
" macy over the corners of the world "."

NOR are these to be regarded as refined fen.
timents of later times. The Brahmins being

confidered

confidered by the Mahomedan conquerors of
India as the guardians of the national religion,
have been so fludioufly deprefied by their
fanatical zeal, that the modern members of that
order are as far inferior to their anceflors in
science as in power. It is from the writings
of their ancient Pundits that they derive the
mofl liberal sentiments which they entertain at
present, and the wisdom for which they are
now celebrated has been transmitted to them
from ages very remote.

THAT this assertion is well founded we are

enabled to pronounce with certainty, as the
most profound mysteries of Hindoo theology,
concealed with the greatest care from the body
of the people; have been unveiled by the tranfc
lations from the Sanlkreet language lately pub-
lifhed. The principal design of the Baghvat-
Geeta, an episode in the Mahabarat, a poem of
the highest antiquity, and of the greatest au.
thority in India, seems to have been to e(fablifh
the doctrine of the unity of the Godhead, and
from a just view of the divine nature, to deduce
an idea of what w6rfhip will be molt acceptable
to a perfect Being. In it, amidst much obscure
metaphysical discussion, some ornaments of
fancy unsuited to our taste, and tome thoughts
elevated to a tract of sublimity into which, from

y our

aur habits of reasoning and judging, we will
find it difficult to follow them , we find de.
scriptions of the Supreme Being entitled to
equal praise with those of the Greek philosophers
which I have celebrated. Of these I fiall now
produce one to which I formerly alluded, and
refer my readers for others to the work itself:
"O mighty Being," fays Arjoon, " who art

the prime Creator, eternal God of Gods, the

"World's Mansion! Thou art the incor.
" ruptible Being, diftinEt from all things tran,
" fient. Thou art before all Gods, the ancient
" Pooroo/fl [i. e. vital foul], and the Supreme
"Supporter of the universe. Thou knoweft
"all things, and art worthy to be known; thou
"art the Supreme Mansion, and by thee, O
"infinite Form, the universe was spread
"abroad! reverence be unto thee before and
' behind; reverence be unto thee on all fides;
" thou who art all in all! Infinite is thy
" power and thy glory.-Thou art the father
"of all things, animate and inanimate. Thou
"art the wife inftrutor of the whole, worthy
" to be adored. There is none like unto thee;
'i where, then, in the three worlds, is there one
" above thee? Wherefore I bow down; and,
' with my body protfrate upon the ground, crave

12 "( thy

" thy mercy, Lord! worthy to be adored;
"for thou shouldest bear with me, even as a
"father with his son, a friend with his friend,
"a loter with his belpvedP." A description
of the Supreme Being is given in one of the
sacred books of the Hindoos, from which it is
evident what were the general sentiments of
the learned Brahmins concerning the divine
nature and perfections: " As God is immaterial,
"he is above all conception; as he is invisible,
"he can have no form; but from what we
'behold of his works, we may conclude, that
"he is eternal, omnipotent, knowing all things,
"and present everywhere q."

To men capable of forming such ideas of the

Deity, the public service in the Pagodas must
have appeared to be an idolatrous worship of
images, by a superstitious multiplication of fri-
volous or immoral rites; and they must have
seen that it was only by fanaity of, heart, and
purity of manners, men could hope to gain
tile approbation of a Being perfeCt in goodness.
This truth Vcias labours to inculcate in the
Mnahabarat, but with the prudent reserve and
artful precautions natural to a Brahmin, studious
neither to offend his countrymen, nor to diminish

the influence of his own order. His ideas con-
cerning the mode of worshipping the Deity, are
explained in many firiking passages of the poem;
but unwilling to multiply quotations, I satisfy
nlyfelf with referring to them r.

WHEN we recoiled how slowly the mind

of man opens to abflrat ideas, and how
difficult (according to an observation in the
Mahabarat) an invisible path is to corporeal
beings, it is evident that the Hipdoos mull have
attained an high degree of improvement before
their sentiments rose so far superior to the po-
pular superstition of their country. The dif.
ferent states of Greece had fubfiited long, and
had made considerable progress in refinement,
before the errors of false religion began to be
detected. It was not until the age of Socrates,
and in the schools of philosophy established by
his disciples, that principles adverse to the
tenets of the popular fuperflition were much
propagated.

A .ONGERp period of time elapsed before the

Romans, a nation of warriors and statesmen,
were enlightened by science, or ventured upon
any free disquisition concerning the objcts or

the rites of w6rlhip authorized by their ancef-
tors. But in India the happy effeets of progress
in science were much more early conspicuous.
Without adopting the wild computations of
Indian chronology, according to which, the
MIahabarat was composed above four thousand
years ago, we mufft allow, that it is a work of
very great antiquity, and the author of it discovers
an acquaintance with the principles of theology, of
morals,and of metaphysics, more juftand rational,
than seems to have been attained, at that period,
by any nation whose history is known.

BUT so unable are the limited powers of the

human mind to form an adequate idea of the
perfections and operations of the Supreme Being,
that in all the theories concerning them, of the
most eminent philosophers in the most en-
lightened nations, we find a lamentable mixture
of ignorance and error. From these the Brah-
mins were not more exempt than the fages of
other countries. As they held that the fyflen
of nature was not only originally arranged by
the power and wisdom of God, but that every
event which happened was brought about by
his immediate interposition, and as they could
not comprehend how a being could aft in any
place unless where it was present, they ftippofed
the Deity to be a vivifying principle diflffed

Y 3 throlugl,

through the whole creation, an universal foul
that animated each 'part of it'. Every intel-
ligent nature, particularly the fouls of men,
they conceived to be portions separated from
this great spirit', to which, after fulfilling their
deltiny on earth, and attaining a proper degree
of purity, they would be again re-united. In
order to efface the slains with which a foul, during
its residence on earth, has been defiled, by the
indulgence of sensual and corrupt appetites, they
taught that it must pass, in a long succession of
transmigrations, through the bodies of different
animals, until, by what it suffers and what it
learns in the various forms of its exiitence. it
{hall be so thoroughly refined from all pollution
as to be rendered meet for being absorbed into
the divine essence, and returns like a drop into
that unbounded ocean from which it originally
issued ". These doctrines of the Brahmins, con.
cerning the Deity, as the foul which pervades
all nature, giving activity and vigour to every
part of it, as well as the final re-union of all
intelligent creatures to their primaeval source,
coincide perfectly with the tenets of the Stoical

School. It is remarkable, that after having
observed a near resemblance in the most sublime
sentiments of their moral doctrine, we should
likewise discover such a similarity in the errors
oftheir theological fpeculationsx.

THE human mind, however, when destitute

offuperior guidance, is apt to fall into a prac-
tical error with refpea to religion, of a tendency
still more dangerous. When philosophers, by
their attainments in science, began to acquire
such jult ideas of the nature and perfecions of
the Supreme Being, as convinced them that
the popular system of fuperflition was not only
absurd but impious, they were fully aware of all
the danger which might arise from communi-
cating what they had discovered to the people,
incapable of comprehending the force of those
reasons which had swayed with them, and io
zealously attached to efilablilhed opinions, as to
revolt against any attempt to detect their failfe-
hood. hlilead, therefore, of allowing any ray of
tha;t knowledge which illuminated their own
minds to reach them, thc'v formed a theory to
juiiify their own conduct, and to prevent the

pelled. The vulgar and unlearned, they
contended, had no right to truth. Doomed by
their condition to remain in ignorance, they
were to be kept in order by delusion, and allured
to do what is right, or deterred from venturing
upon what is wrong, by the hope of those ima.
ginary rewards which fuperifition promises, and
the dread of those punishments which it threatens.
In confirmation of this, I might quote the doc-
trine of moo of the philosophic feets, and pro.
duce the words of almost every eminent Greek
and Roman writer. It will be sufficient, how-
ever, to lay before my readers a remarkable pas-
sage in Strabo, to whom I have been so often
indebted in the course of my researches, and
who was no less qualified to judge with refped
to the political opinions of his contemporaries,
than to describe the countries which they in-
habited. " What is marvellous in fable, is er.

ployed," fays he, " sometimes to please, and

" sometimes to inspire terror, and both there
" are of use, not only with children, but with
" persons of mature age. To children we pro.
' pose delightful fitions, in order to encourage
c: them to aft well, and such as are terrible
" in order to restrain them from evil. Thus
(' whe9 men are united in society, they are ill
" cited to what is laudable, by hearing the poets
" celebrate the splendid acions of fabulous

&" itory,

story, such as the labours of Hercules and

" lhefeus, in reward for which they are now
" honoured as divinities, or by beholding their
" illufirious deeds exhibited to public view in
" painting and sculpture. On the other hand,
"they are deterred from vice, when the punish-

ments infliced by the gods upon evil-doers

"are related, and threats are denounced against
"them in awful words, or represented by fright-
"ful figures, and when men believe that these
" threats have been really executed upon the

guilty. For it is impossible to conduct wo-

" men and the gross multitude, and to render
"them holy, pious, and upright, by the pre-
".cepts of reason and philosophy; superstition,
" or the fear of the gods, must be called in
"aid, the influence of which is founded on
"fitions and prodigies. For the thunder of
"Jupiter, the aegis of Minerva, the trident of
" Neptune, the torches and snakes of the furies,
" the spears of the gods, adorned with ivy, and
"the whole ancient theology, are all fables,
"which the legislators who formed the political
"conflitution of states employ as bugbears to

had adopted in India, and according to which
they regulated their conduct with refpea to
the great body of the people. As their order
had an exclusive right to read the sacred books,
to cultivate and to teach science, they could

bers of it from acquiring any portion of inform.
ation beyond what they were pleased to impart.
When the free circulation of knowledge is not
circumscribed by iuch refrriaions, the whole
community derives benefit from every new ac.
quifition in science, the influence of which,
both upon sentiment and conduct, extends in-
sensibly from the few to the many, from the
learned to the ignorant. But wherever the do-
minion of false religion is completely established,
the body of the people gain nothing by the
greatest improvements in knowledge. Their
philosophers conceal from them, with the utmost
solicitude, the truths which they have discovered,
and labour to support that fabric of superstition
which it was their duty to have overturned.
They not only enjoin others to respect the re-
ligious rites prescribed by the laws of their
country, but conform to them in their own
practice, and, with every cxtcrnal appearance
of reverence and devotion, bow down before
the altars of deities, who mufR inwardly be the

the teachers of true religion in the benevolent

ardour with which they have always communi-
cated to their fellow-men the knowledge of
those important truths, with which their own
minds were enlightened and rendered happy,
the fages of Greece, and the Brahmins of India,
carried on with studied artifice, a scheme of
deceit, and, according to an emphatic expression
of an inspired writer, they detained the truth in
unrighteouflefs z. They knew and approved
what was true, but among the reft of mankind
they laboured to support and to perpetuate
what is false,

TIUS I have gone through all the particulars
which I originally proposed to examine, and
have endeavoured to discover the iRate of the in-

If I had aimed at nothing else than to describe
the civil policy, the arts, the sciences, and re-
ligious institutions of one of the most ancient
and most numerous race of men, that alone
would have led me into inquiries and discussions
both curious and infirutive. I own, however,
that I have all along kept in view an object
more interesting, as well as of greater import-
ance, and entertain hopes, that if the account
which I have given of the early and high civi-

lization of India, and of the wonderful progrcf
of its inhabitants in elegant arts and useful fci.
ence, ihall be received as jull and well eflablifhed,
it may have some influence upon the behaviour
of Europeans towards that people. Unfor.
tunately for the human species, in whatever
quarter of the globe the people of Europe hale
acquired dominion, they have found the inhabit.
ants not only in a fiate of society and improve-
ment far inferior to their own, but different in
their complexion, and in all their habits of life.
Men in every stage of their career are so satis.
sied with the progress made by the community
of which they are members, that it becomes
to them a standard of perfection, and they are
apt to regard people, whose condition is not
similar, with contempt, and even aversion. In
Africa and America, the difimilitude is so con-
fpicuous, that, in the pride of their superiority,
Europeans thought themselves entitled to reduce
the natives of the former to slavery, and to ex.
terminate those of the latter. Even in India,
though far advanced beyond the two other
quarters of the globe in improvement, the co-
lour of the inhabitants, their effeminate ap-
pearance, their unwarlike spirit, the wild extrava'
gance of their religious tenets and ceremonies,
and many other circumtfiances, confirmed I'l-
ropealn in Ifuch an opinion of their own pre-

1 cnmincnce,

eminence, that they have always viewed and
treated them as an inferior race of men. Happy
would it be if any of the four European nations,
who have, fucceflively, acquired extensive ter-
ritories and power in India, could altogether
vindicate itself from having acted in this manner.
Nothing, however, can have a more direA and
powerful tendency to inspire Europeans, proud
of their own superior attainments in policy,
science, and arts, with proper sentiments con-
cerning the people of India, and to teach them
a due regard for their natural rights as men,
than their being accustomed, not only to con-
fider the Hindoos of the present times as a
knowing and ingenious race of men, but to view
them as descended from anceflors who had
attained to a very high degree of improve-
ment, many ages before the least ifep towards
civilization had been taken in any part of Eu-
rope. It was by an impartal and candid in-
quiry into their manners, that the Emperor
Akber was led to confider the Hindoos as no
less entitled to proteEtion and favour than his
other fubjets, and to govern them with such
equity and mildness, as to merit from a grateful
people the honourable appellation of " The
" Guardian of Mankind." Itwas from a thorough
knowcldgc of their character and acquilemnents,
tlat his Vizier Abul Fazcl, with a liberality of

mind

mind unexampled among Mahomedans, pro.
nounces an high encomium on the virtues of
the Hindoos, both as individuals and as mem.
bers of society, and celebrates their attainments
in arts and sciences of every kind a. If I might
presume to hope that the description which I
have given of the manners and institutions of
the people of India could contribute in the
smallest dcgrce, and with the most remote in.
fluence, to render their chara&er more re-
fpcctable, and their condition more happy, I
shall clofc my literary labours with the fatisfadion
of thinking that I have not lived or written in
vain.

CREIrULITY and scepticism are two opposite ex-

tremes into which men are opt to run, in ex-

amining the events which are said to have happened
;i the early ages of antiquity. Without incurring
any suspicion of a propensity to the latter of these, 1
may be allowed to entertain doubts concerning the
expedition of Sefofris into India, and his conquest
of that country.-- i. Few facqs in ancient history
seem to be better established, than that of the early
averflon of the Egyptians to a sea-faring life. Even
the power of dcfpotifm cannot at once change the
idas and manners of a nation, especially when they
hlive been confirmed by long habit, and rendered
sacred by the fandion of religion. That Sefoitris,
il the course of a few years, should have so entirely
Overcoime the prejudices of a flupertitious people, as
to be able to fit out four hundred flips of force

ia

in the Arabian Gulf, besides another fleet which he
had in the Mediterranean, appears to be extremely
improbable. Armaments of such magnitude would
require the utmost efforts of a great and long established
maritime power.--- 2. It is remarkable that Hero-
dotus, who inquired with the most persevering dili.
gence into the ancient hiltory of Egypt, and who re-
ceived all the information concerning it which the
priests of Mlemphis, Heliopolis, and Thebes, could
communicate, Herodot. edit. Weffelingij, lib. ii. c. 3.,
although he relates the history of Sefoftris at some
length, does not mention his conquest of India. Lib. ii.
c. 102, &c. That tale, it is probable, was invented
in the period between the age of Herodotus and that
of Diodorus Siculus, from whom we receive a par-
ticular detail of the Indian expedition of Sefoftris.
His account refts entirely upon the authority of the
Egyptian priests; and Diodorus himself not only
gives it as his general opinion, " that many-things
i( which they related, flowed rather from a desire
" to promote the honour of their country, than from
" attention to truth," lib. i. p. 34. edit. Weffelingij,
Amlt. 1746; but takes particular notice that the
Egyptian priefis, as well as the Greek writers, differ
widely from one another in the accounts which they
give of the atlions of Sefoftris, lib. i. p. 62.-
3. Though I)iodorus asserts, that in relating the history
of Sefoflris he had studied to fcleC what appeared to him
molf probable, and most agreeable to the monument$
of that monarch flill remaining in Egypt, he has ad'
mitted into his narrative many marvellous circumr
flanccs, which render the whole extremely fufpiciolus
1Th fatllhr of Scfultris, as he relates, colleced a11 the

male

male children who were born in Egypt on the fame
(d;y with his son, in order that they might be educated,
together with him, conformable to a mode which he pre-
fcribed, with a view of preparing them as proper inftru-
nicnts to carry into execution the great undertakings
for ,which he destined Scfoftris. Accordingly, when
Scfoflris fct out upon his Indian expedition, which,
from circumstances mentioned by Diodorus, must
have been about the fortieth year of his age, one thou-
sand seven hundred of his youthful affociatcs are said
to have been ltill alive, and were entrusted with high
command in his army. But if we apply to the ex-
amination of this story the certain principles of po-
litical arithmetic, it is evident, that if one thousand
fcvcn hundred of the male children born on the fame
day with Sefoftris were alive when his great expedi-
tion commenced, the number of children born in
Egypt on each day of the year must have been at
least ten thousand, and the population of the kingdom
must have exceeded sixty millions; Goguet l'Originc

WHEN we confider the extent and effecs of the
Phenician commerce, the scanty information concern-
ing it which we receive from ancient writers must, on
a first view, appear surprising. But when we recol-
led that all the Greek Historians, (Herodotus ex-
cepted,) who give any account of the Phenicians, pub-
lified their works long after the deftruaion of Tyre
by Alexander the Great, we will cease to wonder at
their not having entered into minute details with re-
fpea to a trade which was then removed to new feats,
and carried on in other channels. But the power and
opulence of Tyre, in the prosperous age of its com-
merce, muit have attrated general attention. In the
prophecies of Ezekiel, who flourished two hundred
and sixty years before the fall of Tyre, there is the
most particular account of the nature and variety of its
commercial tranfa&ions that is to be found in any
ancient writer, and which conveys, at the fame time,
a magnificent idea of the extensive power of that Rate.

TiE account given of the revenue of the Persian
monarchy by Herodotus is curious, and seems to have
been copied from some public record, which had been
communicated to him. According to it, the Persian
lmpire was divided into twenty satrapys, or govern-

z 2 ments.

ments. The tribute levied from each is specified,
amounting in all to 14,560 Eubccan talents, which Dr.
Arbuthnot reckons to be equal to 2,807,4371. sterling
money; a fum extremely small for the revenue of the
Great King, and which ill accords with many fads
concerning the riches, magnificence, and luxury of the
East, that occur in ancient authors.

NOTE IV. SECT. I. p. 1S.

MAJOR RENNELL, in the second edition of his

Memoir, has traced, from very imperfect materials,
the routes by which Alexander, Tamerlane, and Nadir
Shah penetrated into India, with a degree of ac-
curacy which does honour to his discernment, and
displays the superiority of his knowledge in the an-
cient and modern geography of that country. His
researches he has illustrated by an additional map. To
these I muff refer my readers. Nor are they to con-
fider his laborious investigation merely as an objec
of curiosity; the geography of that fertile and extensive
region of India, distinguished by the name of Patnab,
with which we are at present little acquainted, may
soon become very intereffing. If, on the one hand,
that firm foundation on which the British empire in
India seems to be eftabliffied, by the fucccfsful termi-
nation of the late war, remains unshaken ;-if, on the
other hand, the Seiks, a confederacy of several inde-
pendent fates, fllall continue to extend their domi-
nions with the fame rapidity that they have advanced
since the beginning of the current century;-it is highly
probable that the enterprizing commercial spirit of tle

14 ollP

one people, and the martial ardour of the other, who
still retain the activity and ardour natural to men in
the early Rages of social union, may give rife to
events of the greatest moment. The frontiers of the
two itates are approaching gradually nearer and nearer
to each other, the territories of the Seiks having
reached to the weflern bank of the river Jumnah,
while those of the Nabob of Oude firetch alone its
ealtern bank. This Nabob, the ally or tributary of the
Eal India Company, is supported by a brigade of the
Bengal army, conflantly stationed on his western fron-
tier. Ren. Mem. Introd. p. cxvi. In a position so con-
tiguous, rivalry for power, interference of interest, and
innumerable other causes of jealousy and discord, can
hardly fail of terminating, sooner or later, in open hofli-
lity. The Seiks possess the whole Soubah of Lahore,
the principal part of Moultan, and the western part
of Delhi. The dimensions of this trad are about
400 British miles from N.WM. to S. E. varying in
breadth from 320 to 150 miles. Their capital city is
Lahore. Little is known concerning their govern-
ment and political maxims; but they are represented
as mild. In their mode of making war, they are
unquestionably savage and cruel. Their army conifis
almost entirely of horse; of which they can bring at
least Ioo,ooo into the field. Maj. Ren. Mem. 2d

Ir is surprising that Alexander did not receive, in
tll' provinces contiguous to India, such an account of

z 3 the

the periodical rains in that country, as to shew him
the impropriety of carrying or. military operations
there while these continued. His expedition into
India commenced towards the end of Spring, Arrian,
lib. iv. c. 22., when the rains were already begun in
the mountains from which all the rivers in the Panjab
flow, and of course they must have been considerably
swelled before he arrived on thtir banks. Rennell,
p. 268.-He passed the HI-ydafpes at Midsummer,
about the height of the rainy fcafon. In a country
through which so many large rivers run, an army on
service at this time of the year must have suffered
greatly. An accurate description of the nature of the
rains and inundations in this part of India, is given
by Arrian, lib. v. c. 9.; and one ilill fuller may be
found in Strabo, lib. xv. o I 3,-It was of what they
suffered by thlfe that Alexander's soldiers complained,
Strabo, lib. xv. o021. D.; and not without reason, as
it had rained inceflantly during seventy days, Diod,
Sicul, xvii. c. 94.--A circuniflance which marks the
accuracy with which Alexander's officers had attended
to every thing in that part of India, deserves notice.
Ari(fobulus, in his Journal, which I have mentioned,
observes that, thouhli heavy rains fell in the moun.
tains, and in the country near to them, in the plains
below not so much as a shower fell. Strabo, liv. xv.
1013 . B. loI5. 4. Major Rennell was informed by
a person of character, who had resided in this diftrif
of India, which is now seldom visited by Europeans,
that during great part of the S. W. monsoon, or at
lcil¥ in the months of July, August, and part of
tcpltcmher, which is the rainy season in mol: othcr
, .r[; of India, the trtmofphre in the Delta of the

In dth:

Indus is generally clouded, but no rain falls, except
very near the sea. Indeed, very few showers fall
during the whole season. Captain Hamilton relates,
that when he visited Tatta, no rain had fallen for three
years before. Memoirs, p. 288.-Tamerlane, who,
by the vicinity of the feat of his government to India,
had the means of being well informed concerning the
nature of the country, avoided the error of Alexander,
and made his Indian campaign during the dry season.
As Nadir Shah, both when he invaded India, A. D.
1738, and in his return next year, marched through
the fame countries with Alexander, and nearly in the
fame line of diretion, nothing can give a more frik-
ing idea of the persevering ardour of the Macedonian
conqueror, than the description of the difficulties
which Nadir Shah had to surmount, and the hard-
ships which his army endured. Though poffefled of
absolute power and immense wealth, and diftinguifled
no less by great talents than long experience in the
conduat of war, he had the mortification to lose a
great part of his troops in oroffing the rivers of the
Panjab, in penetrating through the mountains to the
north of India, and in conflicts with the fierce natives
inhabiting the countries which itretch from the
banks of the Oxus to the frontiers of Persia. An
interesting account of his retreat and sufferings is given
in the Memoirs of Khojeh Abdulkurreen, a Cafllme-
iian of difinEtion, who served in his army.

THAT a fleet so numerous Ihould have been colleaed

incredible. Arrian, however, assures us, that in fpe*
cifying this number, he followed Ptolemy, the son of
Lagus, whose authority he confidered to be of the
greatest weight, lib. vi. c. 3. But as the Panjab
country is full of navigable rivers, on which all the
intercourse among the natives was carried on, it
abounded with veflils ready conftrudced to the con,
queror's hands, so that he might easily colled that
number. If we could give credit to the account of
the invasion of India by Semiramis, no fewer.than
four thousand vessels were aflembled in the Indus to
oppose her fleet. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii. c. 74.-It is
remarkable that when Mahmoud of Gaznah invaded
India, a fleet was colledced on the Indus to oppose
him, consisting of the fame number of vessels. We
learn from the Ayeen Akbery, that the inhabitants of
this part of India frill continue to carry on all their
communication with each other by water; the inha-
bitants of the Circar of Tatta alone have not lets than
forty thousand vessels of various confirudions. Vol. ii.

NOTE VII. SECT. I. p. 24.

ALL these particulars are taken from the Indian

History of Arrian, a work different from that already
mentioned, and one of the most curious treaties
transmitted to us from antiquity, The first part of it
confits of extrads from the account given by Near-
chus of the climate and foil of India, and the man-
ners of the natives. The fccond contains that officer's
journal of his voyage fromthe mouth of the Indus to
the bottom of the Pcrfian Gulf. Thc perusal of it

gives

gives rife to several obfervations.-I. It is remarkable
that neither Nearchus, nor Ptolemy, nor Arifobulua,
nor even Arrian, once mention the voyage of Scylax,
This could not proceed from their being unacquainted
with it, for Herodotus was a favourite author in the
hands of every Greek who had any pretensions to
literature. It was probably occasioned by the reasons
which they had to distrust the veracity of Scylax, of
which I have already taken notice. Accordingly, in a
fpecch ywhich Arrian puts into the mouth of Alexan-
der, he asserts that, except Bacchus, he was the first
who had passed the Indus; which implies, that he dif,
believed what is related concerning Scylax, and was
not acquainted with what Darius Hyftafpes is said to
hlave done in order to subjed that part of India to the
Persian crown. Arrian, vii. c. Io. This opinion is
confirmed by Megafthenes, who resided a considerable
time in India. -He aflerts that, except Bacchus and
Hercules, (to whose fabulous expeditions Strabo is
alRoniflhed that he should have given any credit,
lib. xv. p. 100oo7. D.) Alexander was the firlt who had
invaded India; Arrian, Hilt. Indic. c. 5. We are
informed by Arrian, that the Affacani, and other
people who poffefled that country, which is now
called the kingdom of Candahar, paid tribute, first to
the Ailyrians, and afterwards to the Medes and Per-
sians; Hlift. Indic. c. i. As all the fertile provinces
on tlhe north-west of the Indus were anciently
rccloned to be part of India, it is probable that what
was levied from them is the fum mentioned in the
tribute-roll, from which Herodotus drew his accon::t
of the annual revenue of the Persian empire, and t.:.t
none of the provinces to the south of the Indus were

ever

ever fubje& to the kings of Persia.- 2. This voyage
of Nearchus affords some striking instances of the im.
perfe0t knowledge which the ancients had of any
navigation different from that to which they were ac-
customed in the Mediterranean. Though the enter.
prifing genius and enlarged views of Alexander
prompted him to attempt opening an intercourse by
sea between India and his Persian dominions, yet both
he and Nearchus knew so little of the ocean which
they wished to explore, as to be apprehensive that it
might be found impossible to navigate it, on account
of impervious straits, or other obitacles. Hist. Indic.
c. 20. QOCurt. lib. ix. c. 9. When the fleet arrived
near the mouth of the Indus, the aftonifilment excited
by the extraordinary flow and ebb of tide in the In-
dian ocean, a phenomenon (according to Arrian) with
which Alexander and his soldiers were unacquainted,
lib. vi. c. 19. is another proof of their ignorance in
maritime science. Nor is there any reason to be fur.
prifed at their astonishment, as the tides are hardly
perceptible in the Mediterranean, beyond which the
knowledge of the Greeks and Macedonians did not
extend. For the fame reason, when the Romans
carried their victorious arms into the countries situated
on the Atlantic Ocean, or on the seas that communi-
cate with it, this new phenomenon of the tides was an
obje& of wonder and terror to them. Caesar describes
the amazement of his soldiers at a spring-tide, which
greatly damaged the fleet with which lie invaded Bri-
tain, and acknowledges that it was an appearance with
which they were unacquainted; Bell. Gallic. lib. iv.
c. 29. The tides on the coast near the mouth of the
Indus are remarkably high, and the cffcCts of then

very

very great, especially that sudden and abrupt influx of
the tide into the mouths of rivers or narrow straits
which is known in India by the name of The Bore, and
is accurately described by Major Rennell, Introd. xxiv.
Nem. 278. In the Periplus Maris Erythrsei, p. 26.,
these high tides are mentioned, and the description of
them nearly resembles that of the Bore. A very ex-
aggerated account of the tides in the Indian ocean is
given by Pliny, Nat. Hiit. lib. xiii. c. 25. Major Ren-
nell seems to think, that Alexander and his followers
could not be so entirely unacquainted with the pheno-
menon of the tides, as Herodotus had informed the
Greeks, " that in the Red Sea there was a regular ebb
:" and flow of the tide every day ;" lib. ii. c. I i. This
is all the explanation of that phenomenon given by
Herodotus. But among the ancients there occur in-
stances of inattention to faas, related by refpeaable
authors, which appear surprising in modern times.
Though Herodotus, as I have just now observed, gave
an account of the voyage performed by Scylax at con-
fiierable length, neither Alexander, nor his Hiflorians,
take any notice of that event. I flall afterwards have
occasion to mention a more remarkable instance of the
inattention of later writers to an accurate description
which Herodotus had given of the Caspian sea. From
these, and other similar instances which might have
been produced, we may conclude, that the flight men-
tion of the regular flow and ebb of tide in the Red
Sen, is not a sufficient reason for rejecing, as incre-
'liblc, Arrian's account of the surprise of Alexander's
f(lilicrs when they first beheld the extraordinary efffets
of the tide at the mouth of the Indus.- 3. The
CQourfc of NelrchLus's voyage, the promontories, the

creeks,

creeks, the rivers, the cities, the mountains, which
came fuccelfively in his view, are so clearly decfribed,
and the distances of such as were most worthy of
notice are so diftinftly marked, that M. D'Anville, by
comparing these with the atual position of the coun-
try, according to the best accounts of it, ancient as
well as modern, has been able to point out most of the
places which Nearchus mentions, with a degree of
certainty which does as much honour to the veracity
of the Grecian navigator, as to the induitry, learning,
and penetration of the Frcnch geographer. Mlem. de
Literat. tom. xxx. p. 132, &c.

IN modern times, the Red Sea is a name appropri-

ated to the Arabian Gulf, but the ancients denomi-
nated the ocean which stretches from- that Gulf to
India, the Erythrvean Sea, from king Erythras, of
whom nothing more is known than the name, which
in the Greek language signifies red. From this casual
meaning of the word, it came to be believed, that it
was of a different colour from other seas, and confe-
quently of more dangerous navigation.

Whether the Hiflorians of Indoftan have given an
account of Alexander's invasion of India with greater
accuracy, cannot be known, until some of their works,
written in the Sanfkreet, are translated. That some

is still preserved in the northern provinces of the Pcn-
infula, is manifest from fvcrnal circumfianccs. The

Onrm's lFragm,1 p. ;, I\ljor Rcnncll has informied

me,

me, by accounts lately received from India, and
confirmed by a variety of teitimonies, that, in the
country of Kuttore, the eastern extreme of the
ancient Ba6aria, a people who claimed to be the
descendants of Alexander's followers, were existing
when Tamerlane invaded that province. In Bijore, a
country more to the weft in the fame difiridt, the
Bazira of Alexander, there is a tribe at this day
which traces its origin to certain persons left there by
the conqueror when he pafled through that province.
Both Abul Fazel, and Soojah Rae, an eastern Hifto.
rian of good reputation, report this tradition without
any material variation. The latter, indeed, adds, that
these Europeans, if we may call them so, continued
to preserve that ascendency over their neighbours,
which their ancestors may be supposed to have poffefled
when they first fettled here. Although we ihould
reject this pedigree as false, yet the bare claim argues
the belief of the natives, for which there must have
been some foundation, that Alexander not only con-
quered Bijore, but also transferred that conquefl to
some of his own countrymen. Rennell Mlem. 2d
edit. p. i62. The people of Bijore had likewise an
high idea of Alexander's extensive authority; and they,
too, denominated him the Two-horned, agreeably to
the firiking emblem of power in all the eastern lan-
guages. Ayeen Akbery, xi. 194. Many instances
of this emblem being used, will occur to every person
accultomed to read the sacrcd Scriptures.

Ir seems to be an opinion generally received, that

Alexander built only two cities in India, Nicsea and
Bucephalia, situated on the Hydafpes, the modern
Chelum, and that Craterus superintended the building
of both. But it is evident, from Arrian, lib. v.
c. ult., that he built a third city on the Acefines, now
the Jenaub, under the direction of Hepheftion; and
if it was his object to retain the command of the
country, a place of strength on some of the rivers to
the south of the Hydafpes seems to have been necessary
for that purpose. This part of India has been so little
visited in modern times, that it is impossible to point
out with precision the situation of these cities. If P.
Tieffenthaler were well founded in his conjecture, that
the river now called Rauvee is the Acefines of Arrian,
Bernouilli, vol. i. p. 39., it is probable that this city
was built somewhere near Lehore, one of the molt
important stations in that part of India, and reckoned
in the Ayeen Akbery to be a city of very high
antiquity. But Major Rennell, in my opinion, gives
good reasons for supposing the Jenaub to be the Ace-
fines of the ancients.

THE religious scruples which prevented the PerlianS

mately these ideas were conneced with the docrines

wars of the Persians with Greece, the feets of the
Great King coniflled entirely of ihips furnished by the
Phenicians, Syrians, the conquered provinces of the
Leffir ASia, and the illands adjacent. Herodotus and
Diodorus Siculus mention the quota furnifhled by each
country, in order to compose the fleet of twelve
hundred ships with which Xerxes invaded Greece, and
among these there is not one belonging to Persia. At
the fame time it is proper to observe, that, according to
Herodotus, whose authority is unexceptionable with
regard to this point, Ariabigines, a son of Darius,
ased as Admiral of the Persian fleet, and had several
satraps of high rank under his command, and both
Persians and Medes served as soldiers on board of it;
Herod. lib. vii. c. 96, 97. By what motives, or what
authority, they were induced to aEt in this manner, I

AM. LE BARON DE SAINTE-CROIX, in his ingenious

IT is from Jufitn we receive the fiender knowledge

we have of the progress which Selcucus made in
India; lib. xv. c. 4. But we cannot rely on his evi-
dence, unless when it is confirmed by the teflimony of
other authors. Plutarch seems to aflert, that Seleucus
had penetrated far into India; but that refpetable
writer is more eminent for his discernment of cha-
raers, and his happy feletion of those circumltances
which mark and discriminate them, than for the ac-
curacy of his historical researches. Pliny, whose
authority is of greater weight, feerns to confider it as
certain, that Seleucus had carried his arms into
difirias of India which Alexander never visited; Plin.
Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 17. The passage in which this
is mentioned, is somewhat obscure, but it seems to
imply, that Seleucus had marched from the Hyphafis
to the Hyfudrus, from thence to Palibothra, and front
that to the mouth of the Ganges. The distances of
the principal stations in this march are marked, the
whole amounting to 2244 Roman miles. In this fenfc,
M. Bayer understands the words of Pliny; Iliftor.
Regni Grccorum Bastriani, p. 37. But to me it ap-
pears highly improbable, that the Indian expedition of
Seleucus could have continued so long as to allow tinme
for operations of fucl extent. If Selcucus had a(d

14 vylICCd

vanced as far into India as the mouth of the Ganges,
the ancients must have had a more accurate know-
ledge of that part of the country than they seem ever
to have poffefled.

NOTE X1III SECT. I. p. 39.

MAJOR RENNELL gives a magnificent idea of this,
by informing us, that "' the Ganges, after it has
" efcnped from the mountainous traa in which
"it had wandered above eight hundred miles,"
Alem. p. 233. " receives in its course through the
, plains eleven rivers, some of them as large as the
" Rhine, and none smaller than the Thames, besides
" as many more of lesser note " p. 257.

NOTE XIV. SECT. I. P. 39.

IN fixing the position of Palibothra, I have ventured
to differ from Major Rennell, and I venture to do so
with diffidence. According to Strabo, Palibothra was
ftuated at the junction of the Ganges and another
river; lib .

x . p1028. A. Arrian is still more ex-

plicit. He places Palibothra at the confluence of the
Ganges and Erranaboas, the last of which le describes
as less than the Ganges or Indus, but greater than any
otlher known river; Hist. Ind. c. o1. This description
0f its situation corresponds exaaly with that of Alla-
labad. P. Boudier, to whose observations the geo-
ra'pliy of India' is much indebted, fays, that the
Jmnna, at its juniioi with the Ganges, appeared to

^ A 2 him

him not inferior in magnitude to that river; D'Anville,
Antiq. de l'lnde, p. 53. Allahabad is the name which
was given to that city by the emperor Akbar, who
eretled a lirong fortress there; an elegant delineation
of which is published by Mr. Hodges, No. IV. of his
Selec Views in India. Its ancient name, by which
it is still known among the Hindoos, is Praeg, or
PiySa, and the people of the diflria are called Praegi,
which bears a near resemblance to Prafij, the ancient
appellation of the kingdom of which Palibothra was
the capital; P. Tieflenthaler, Bernouilli, tom. i. 223.
D'AnvilIe, p. 56. Allahabad is such a noted feat of
Hindoo devotion, that it is denominated The king of
Worjfipped Placer; Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 3;.
I' The territory around it, to the extent of forty miles,
" is deemed holy ground. The Hindoos believe, that
" when a man dies in this place, whatever he wifles
" for he will obtain in his next regeneration. Al-
4c though they teach that suicide in general will be
" punished with torments hereafter, yet they confider
"' it as meritorious for a man to kill himself at Alla-

l: habad;" Ayeen Akbery, iii. 256. P. Tieflenthaler

describes the various objects of veneration at Allaha-
bad, which are still visitcd with great devotion by an
immense number of pilgrims ; B3crouilli, tom. i. 224.
From all these circumltances, we may conclude it to
be a place of great antiquity, and in the fame situation
with the Palibothia of antiquity.

M.JOR REINNEi.L has been induced to place Pali-

bothra on the fame .ite with Patna, chiefly by two
cotlfiderations.-- l. From having learned that on or
nea.r the site of Patna stood anciently a very large city

nain¢c

named Patelpoot-her or Patalipputra, which nearly
resembles the ancient name of Palibothra. Although
there is not now a confluence of two rivers at Patna,
le was informed that the juncaion of the Soane with
the Ganges, now twenty-two miles above Patna, was
formerly under the walls of that city. The rivers of
India sometimes change their course in a singular man-
ner, and he produces Tome remarkable instances of it.
But even mould it be allowed, that the accounts which
the natives give of this variation in the course of the
Soane were perfectly accurate, I question whether
Arrian's description of the magnitude of the Errana-
boas be applicable to that river, certainly not so jufily
as to the Jumna.- 2. He seems to have been in-
fluenced, in some degree, by Pliny's Itinerary, or
Table of Distances from Taxila (the modern Attock) to
the mouth of the Ganges; Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 17.
But the distances in that Itinerary are marked so in-
accurately, and in tome instances are so palpably
erroneous, that one cannot found upon them with
much security. According to it, Palibothra is situated
four hundred and twenty-five miles below the con-
fluence of the Jumna and Ganges. The aaual dif-
tance, however, between Allahabad and Patna, is not
more than two hundred Britiih miles. A difigree-
ment so confderable cannot be accounted for, without
supposing rome extraordinary error in the Itinerary, or
that the point of conflux of the Jumna with the Ganges
has undergonc a, change. For the former of these sup-
politions there is no authority (as far as I know) from
any manuscript, or for the latter from any tradition.
MIajor Rennell has produced the reasons which led hini
to fippofe the site of Palibothra to be the fame with

A A 3 that

that of Patna; Memoires, p. 49-54. Some of the
objections which might be made to this supposition he
has foreseen, and endeavoured to obviate; and after
all that I have added to them, I shall not be surprised,
if, in a geographical difcuflion, my readers are dif.
posed to prefer his decision to mine.

I DO not mention a short inroad into India by An,

he carried on against the two revolted provinces of

A FACT cursorily related by Strabo, lnd which ha>

Nomades, who came from the country beyond the
Jaxartes, and are known by the names of Afij, Pafiani,
Tachari, and Sacarauli; Strab. lib. xi. p. 779. A.

As the distance of Arfinoe, the modern Suez, from

the Nile, is considerably less than that between Bere-
nice and Coptos, it was by this route that all the com-
modities imported into the Arabian Gulf, might have
been conveyed with most expedition and least expence
into Egypt. But the navigation of the Arabian Gulf,
which even in the present improved state of nautical fci-
ence is flow and dlilfcult, was in ancient times confidered
by the nations around it to be so extremely perilous, that
it led them to give such names to several of its pro-
montories, bays, and harbours, as convey a striking
iea of the impression which the dread of this danger
had made upon their imagination. The entry into
the Gulf they called Babelmandnb, the gate or port of
aflition. To a harbour not far distant, they gave
the name of IMete, i. e. Death. A headland adjacent
they called Gardefan, the Cape of Burial. Other de-
noniinations of similar import are mentioned by the
author to whom I am indebted for this information.
Bruce's Travels, vol. i. p. 442, &c. It is not furprif-
ing then, that the staple of Indian trade fiould have
been transferred from the northern extremity of the
Arabian Gulf to Berenice, as by this change a danger.
ous navigation was greatly fholtened. This seems to
have been the chief reason that induced Ptolemy to
cftablifi the port of communication with India at Be-
renice, as there were other harbours on the Arabian
Gulf which were considerably nearer than it to the
Nile. At a later period, after the ruin of Coptos by

A A 4 the

the Emperor Diocletian, we are informed by Abulfeda,
Defcript. Egypt. edit. Michaelis, p. 77, that Indian
commodities were conveyed from the Red Sea to the
Nile, by the shortest route, viz. from Coffeir, pro.
bably the Philoteras Portus us Ptolemy, to Cous, the
Vicus Apollinis, a journey of four days. The fame
account of the distance was given by the natives to
Dr Pococke, Travels, vol. i. p. 87. In consequence
of this, Cous, from a small village, became the city in
,pper Egypt next in magnitude to Foftat, or Old Cairo.
In process of time, from causes which I callnot explain,
the trade from the Red Sea by Coffeir removed to
Kene, farther down the river than Cous, Abulf. p. 13.

all the commodities of India imported into Egypt, are
either brought by sea from Gidda to Suez, and thence
carried on camels to Cairo, or are conveyed by land
carriage by the caravan returning from the pilgrimage
to Mecca, Niebuhr Voyage, tom. i. . 224. Volney, i.
188, &c. This, as far as I have been able to trace it,
is a complete account of all the different routes by
which the productions of the East have been conveyed
to the Nile, from the first opening of that communi-
cation. It is singular that P. Sicard, Mem. des Missions
dans le Levant, tom, ii. p. 157, and some other re.
fpetahle writers, should suppose Cofleir to.be the Be.
renice founded by Ptolemy, although Ptolemy has laid
down its latitude at 23° 50', and Strobo has described
it as nearly under the fame parallel with that of SyenS,
lib. ii. p. :95, D. In conifequence of this mistake,
Pliny's computation of the dittance between Berenice
and Coptos, at two hundred and fifty.eight miles, has
been deemed erroneous. Pucocke, .p. 87. But as

rliny

Pliny not only mentions the total distance, but names
the different itations in the journey, and specifies the
number of miles between each; and as the Itinerary
of Antoninus coincides exaEtly with his account,
D'Arville Egypte, p. 2(, there is no reason to call inr
question the accuracy of it.

NOTE XVIII. SECT. I. p. 48.

MAJOR RENNELL is of opinion, " that under the

- Ptolemies, the Egyptians extended their navigation to
" the extreme point of the Indian continent, and even
- failed up the Ganges to Palibothra," on the fame site
(according to him) with the modern Patna. Introd.
p. xxxvi. But had it been usual to fail up the Ganges
as high as Patna, the interior parts of India must have
been better known to the ancients than they ever
were, and they would not have continued to derive
their information concerning them from Megaf-
thenes alone. Strabo begins his description of
India in a very remarkable manner. He requests
his readers to peruse with indulgence the account
which he gives of it, as it was a country very
remote, and few persons had visited it; and of these,
many having seen only a small part of the country,
related things either from hear-say, or, at the belt,
what they had hastily remarked while they passed
through it in the course of military service, or on a
journey. Strabo, lib. xv. p. iooS. B. He takes notice
that few of the traders from the Arabian Gulf ever
r.clictd the Ganges. Ibid. Ioo6. C. He asserts,
that the Ganges enters the sea by one mouth, ibid.
101l. C.; an error into which he could not have

fallen

/

fallen if the navigation of that river had been common
in his time. He mentions indeed tile failing up the
Ganges, ibid. Ioio, but it is cursorily in a single fen.
tence; whereas, if such a considerable inland voyage
of above four hundred miles, through a populous and
rich country, had been cuflomary, or even if it had
ever been performed by the Roman, or Greek, or
Egyptian traders, it mutt have merited a particular de-
scription, and muflt have been mentioned by Pliny
and other writers, as there was nothing similar to it
in the practicc of navigation among the ancients. It
is observed by Arrian, (or whoever is the author of the
Periplus Maris Erythrqai,) that previous to the dif-
covery of a new route to India, which shall be men.
:ioned afterwards, the commerce with that country
was-carried on in small veftels which failed round
every bay, p. 32. Ap. Hudf. Geogr. Min. Vessels of
such light conftrution, and which followed this mode
of failing, were ill fitted for a voyage so distant as
that round Cape Comorin, and up the bay of Bengal,
to Patna. It is not improbable, that the merchants
whom Strabo mentions as having reached the Ganges,
may have travelled thither by land, either from the
countries towards the mouth of the Indus, or from
some part of the Malabar coast, and that the naviga!
tion up the Ganges, of which he casually takes notice,
was performed by the natives in veflils of the country.
This opinion derives some confirmation from his re-
marks upon the bad ftru6ure of the vessels which fre-
quented that part of the Indian ocean. From his de-
scription of them, p. o012. C. it is evident that they
were venlels of the country.

THE erroneous ideas of many intelligent writers of

antiquity with refpeEt to the Caspian Sea, though well
known to every man of letters, are so remarkable, and
afford such a iriking example of the imperfection of
their geographical knowledge, that a more full account
of them may not only be acceptable to some of my
readers, but in endeavouring to trace the various routes
by which the commodities of the East were conveyed
to the nations of Europe, it becomes neceflary to enter
into some detail concerning their various sentiments
with rffpeat to this matter. i. According to Strabo,
the Caspian is a bay, that communicates with the great
Northern ocean, from which it issues at firit, by a nar-
row strait, and then expands into a sea extending in
breadth five hundred stadia, lib. xi. p. 773. A. With
him Pomponius Mela agrees, and describes the strait
by which the Caspian is conneO.ed with the ocean, as
of considerable length, and fp narrow that it had the
appearance of a river, lib. iii. c. 5. edit. Pliny like-
wife gives a similar description of it, Nat. Hilt. lib. vi.
c. 13. In the age of Juilinian, this opinion concern-
ing the communication of the Caspian Sea with the
ocean, was still prevalent; Cofm. Indicopl. Topog.
Christ. lib. ii. p. 138. C. 2. Some early writers, by a
mistake fill more singular, have supposed the Caspian Sea
tobeconnecded with the Euine. QuintusCurtius,wlhofe
ignorance of geography is notorious, has adopted this
error, lib. vii. . 7. edit. 3. Arrian, though a much
MPore judicious writer, a3nd who by residing for some

time

time in the Roman province of Cappadocia, of which
he was governor, might have obtained more accurate
information, declares in one place, the origin of the
Caspian Sea to be still unknown, and is doubtful whe-
ther it was connected with the Euxine, or with the
great Eastern ocean which surrounds India; lib. vii.
c. i6. In another place he aferts, that there was a
communication between the Caspian and the Eastern
ocean; lib. v. c. 26., These errors appear more extra-
ordinary, as a just description had been given of the
Caspian by Herodotus, near five hundred years before
the age of Strabo. "( The Caspian (fays he) is a sea
' by itftlf, unconneced with any other. Its length is
,c as much as a vessel with oars can fail in fifteen days,
"( its greatest breadth as much as it can fail in eight
" days;" lib. i. c. 203. Aristotle describes it in the
fame manner, and with his ufaal precision contends
that it ought to be called a great lake, notra sea; Mete-
orolog. lib. ii. Piodorus Siculus concurs with them
in opinion, vol. ii. lib. xviii. p. 261. None of those
authors determine whether the greatest length of the
Caspian was from North to South, or from East to
Weft. In the ancient maps which illultrate the geo-
graphy of Ptolemy, it is delineated, as if its greatest
length extended from East to Weft. In modern times,
the first information concerning the true form of the
Caspian which the people of Europe received, was
given by Anthony Jenkinfon, an English merchant,
who with a caravan from Russia travelled along a con-
fiderable p.irt of its coast in the year 1558; Hakluyt

and it is now ascertained not only that the Caspian is
unconnected with any other sea, but that its length
from North to South is considerably more than its
greatest breadth from East to Weft. The length of
the Caspian from North to South is about fix hundred
and eighty miles, and in no part more than two hun-
dred and sixty miles in breadth from East to Weft.
Coxe's Travels, vol. ii. p. 257. The proportional differ-
ence of its length and breadth accords nearly with
that mentioned by Herodotus. From this detail, how-
ever, we learn how the ill-founded ideas concerning it,
which were generally adopted, gave rife to various
wild schemes of conveying Indian commodities to Eu-
rope by means of its supposed communication with
the Euxine sea, or with the Northern ocean. It is an
additional proof of the attention of Alexander the
Great to every thing conducive to the improvement of
commerce, thata short time before his death he gave
directions to fit out a squadron in the Caspian, in or-
der to survey that sea, and to discover whether it was
conneEted either with the Euxine or Indian ocean;

FROM this curious detail, we learn how imperfec

ancient navigation was, even in its most improved lfate.
The voyage from Berenice to Ocelis, could not have
taken thirty days, if any other course had been held
than that of servilely following the windings of the
coast. The voyage from Ocelis to Mufiris would be
(according to Major Rcnnell) fifteen days run for an

European

European ship in the modern flile of navigation, being
about seventeen hundred and fifty marine miles, on a
firaight course; Introd. p. xxxvii. It is remarkable,
that though the Periplus Maris Erythrzi was written
after the voyage of Hippalus, the chief object of tile
author of it is to describe the ancient course along the
coss of Arabia and Persia, to the mouth of the Indus,
and from thence down the weflern shore of the con.
tinent to Mufiris. I can account for this, only by
supposing, that from the unwillingness of mankind to
abandon old habits, the greater part of the traders from
Berenice still continued to follow that route to which
they were accultomed. To go from Alexandria to
\Ilufiris, required (according to Pliny) ninety-four
days. In the year 1788, the Boddam, a ship belong-
ing to the English Eaft-India Company, of a thousand
tons burthen, took only fourteen days more to com-
plete her voyage from Portsmouth to Madras. Such
are the improvements which have been made in
navigation.

IT was the opinion of Plato, that in a well-regulated

commonwealth the citizens should not engage in com-
merce, nor the state aim at obtaining maritime power.
Commerce, he contends, would corrupt the purity of
their morals, and by entering into the fea.fervice,
they would be accustomed to find pretexts forjuftify-
ing condu(t so inconsistent with what was manly and
becoming, as would gradually relax the ftriaiefs of
military lifcipline. It had been better for the Athe-

nians,

nians, he asserts, to have continued to fend annually
the sons of seven of their principal citizens to be de-
voured by the Minotaur, than to have changed their
ancient manners, and to have become a maritime power.
In that perfect republic, of which he delineates the
form, he ordains that the capital should be situated at
leiaf ten miles from the sea; De Legibus, lib. iv. ab
initio. These ideas of Plato were adopted by other
philosophers. Aristotle enters into a formal discussion
of the question, Whether a state rightly conflituted
should be commercial or not ? and though abundantly
dlifpofed to espouse sentiments opposite to those of
Plato, he does not venture to decide explicitly with
relpet to it; De Rcpub. lib. vii. c. 6. In ages when
such opinions prevail, little information concerning
commerce can. be expected.

termine which is mons conformable to truth. I have
adhered to the former, because we have many in-
ilances of the exorbitant price of pearls, but none, as
far as I know, of diamonds having been purchased at
a rate so high. In this opinion I am confirmed by a
pafnlgc in Pliny, lib. xix. c. i.; having mentioned the
txorbitant price of Alr, los, he fays, ," quat pratia

confidered pearls to be of higher price than any other

PLINY has devoted two entire books of his Natural

HiRfory, lib. xii. and xiii. to the enumeration and de.
scription of the spices, aromatics, ointments, and per.
fumes, the use of which luxury had introduced among
his countrymen. As many of these were the produc-
tions of India, or of the countries beyond it, and as
the trade with the East was carried on to a great ex-
tent in the age of Pliny, we may form some idea of
the immense demand for them, from the high price
at which they continued to be fold in Rome. To com-
pare the prices of the fame commodities in ancient
Rome, with those now paid in our own country, is
not a gratification of curiosity merely, but affords a
Standard by which we may estimate the different de-
gree of success with which the Indian trade has been

bM. MAHUDEL, in a memoir read in the academy of

infcriptiors and belles letters in the year 1719, has
collefled the various opinions of the ancients concern-
ing the nature and origin of silk, which tend all to
prove their ignorance with regard to it. Since the
publication of M. Mahudel's memoir, P. du Halde has
dcfcribed a species of silk, of which I believe he com-
municated the first notice to the moderns. " This is
" produced by small infeEts nearly resembling snails.
"They do not form cocoons either round or oval like
"the silk-worm, but spin very long threads, which
"fasten themselves to trees and bushes as they are driven
" by the wind. These are gathered, and wrought
" into silk fluffs, coarser than those produced by do-
" meftic silk-worms. The inse&ts which produce this
" coarse silk are wild." Description de 1'Empire de

As these public Surveys and Itineraries furnished the

ancient geographers with the belt information concern.
ing the position and distances of many places, it may
be proper to point out the manner in which they were
completed by the Romans. The idea of a general
survey of the whole empire was first formed by Julius
Csefar, and, having been begun by him under authority
of a decree of the senate, was finished by Augustus.
As Rome was still far inferior to Greece in science, the
execution of this great undertaking was committed to
three Greeks, men of great abilities, ,and ikilled in
every part of philosophy. The survey of the eastern
division of the empire was finished by Zenodoxus in
fourteen years five months and nine days. That of
the northern division was finished by Theodotus in
twenty years eight months and ten days. The foutherm
division was fininfed in twenty-five years one month
and ten days. .Athici Cofinographia apud Geogra-
phos, editos ' lien. Stephano, 1577. p. 107. This
undertaking was worthy of those illustrious persons
who planned it, and suited to the magnificence of a
great people. Befidcs this general survey, every new
war produced a new delineation and measurement of
the countries which were the feat of it. We may con-

J]udc from Vegetius, Inftit. Rci Militaris, lib. iii. c, 6

J14 tlJt

that every governor of a Roman province was furnished
witl a dedcription of it; in which were specified the
distance of places in miles, the nature of the roads,
the bye-roads, the short cuts, the mountains, the rivers,
&c.; all these, fays he, were not only described in
words, but were delineated in a map, that, in delibe-
rating concerning his military movements, the eyes of
a general might aid the decisions of his mind.

NOTE XXX. SECT. II. p. 83.

THE consequence of this mistake is remarkable.

Ptolemy, lib. vii. c. i., computes the latitude of Barry-
gaza, or Baroach, to be I7° 2o'; and that of Cory, or
Cape Comorin, to be 13 " 20', which is the difference
of four degrees precisely; whereas the real difference
between these two places is nearly fourteen degrees.

NOTE XXXI. SECT. II. p. 84.

RAMUSIO, the publisher of the molt ancient and per-
haps the most valuable Collection of Voyages, is the
first person, as far as I know, who takes notice of this
firange error of Ptolemy; Viaggi, vol. i. p. 18i. lie
justly observes, that the Author of the Circumnavi-
gation of the Erythrsan Sea had been more accurate,
and had described the peninsula of India as extending
from north to south; Peripl. p. 24. 29.

NOTE XXXII. SECT. II. p. 87.

Tins error of Ptolemy justly merits the name of
tecrllctl, /which I have given to it; and it will appear
nlore surprising when we recollec, that he rmuft have

B B 3 been

been acquainted, not only with what Herodotus relates
concerning the circumnavigation of Africa, by order of
one of the Egyptian kings, lib. iv. c. 4., but with the
opinion of Eratolthenes, who held that the great ex-
tc,;t of the Atlantic ocean was the only thing which
prevented a communication between Europe and India
by tea; Strab. Geogr. lib. i. p. 13. A. This error,
however, must not be imputed wholly to Ptolemy.
IIipparchus, whom we may confider as his guide, had
taughlt that the earth is not surrounded by one conti.
Iluous ocean, but that it is separated by different ifth.
muses, which divide it into several large bafons; Strab,
lib. i. p. i . B. Ptolemy, having adopted this opinion,
was induced to maintain that an unknown country ex-
tented from Cattigara to Praffum on the south-east
coast of Arica ; Geogr, lib. vii. c. 3, and 5. As Pto-
lemy's fyflem of geography was univcrfally received,
this error spread along with it. In conformity to it
the Arabian geographer Edriffi, who wrote in the
twelfth century, taught that a continued trad of land
ftretcled eastward from Sofala on the African coast,
until it united with some part of the Indian continent;

IN this part of the Disquisition, as well as in the

Inap prepared for illuifrating it, the genoraphical ideas
of Ml. I)'Anville, to which Major Rennell las given
the fansdion of his approbation, Introd. p. xxxix. have
been generally adopted. But IVI. Goflellin has lately
publifltld, " The Geography of the Greeks annlifed;
" or, the Systems of Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Ptolc-
" my, compared with each other, and with the K]now-

ledge wlich the Moderns have acquired ;" a learned

and ingenious work, in which he differs from his
countryman with refpec- to many of his determina-
tions. According to M. Goffellin, the Magnum Pro-
niontorium, which M. D'Anville concludes to be Cape
Romania, at the southern extremity of the peninsula
of Malacca, is the point of Bragu, at the mouth of
the great river Ava; near to which he places Zaba,
supposed by M. D'Anville, and by Barros, Decad. ii.
liv. vi. c. i. to be situated on the strait of Sincapura
or Malacca. The Magnus Sinus of Ptolemy he holds
to be the fame with the Gulf of Martaban, not the
Gulf of Siam, according to M. D'Anville's decision.
'ITh position of Cattigara,. as lie endeavours to prove,
corresponds to that of Mergui, a considerable port ol
the weft coall of the kingdom of Siam, and that Tlin:e,
or Siin Metropolis, whiclh M. D'Aniville removes as
far as Sin-lioa, in the kingdom of Cochin China, is
itnatcd on the fame river witlh Mrgui, and now bears
t11t n;line of T';na-.fcrin. Thle Ibadij Infula of Ptolemy,
xllihil M. D'Anivile determines to be Sumatra, lie

u 1 4 cointends,

contends, is one of that cluster of small isles which
lie off this part of the coast of Siam; p. 137-148.
According to M. Goffllin's system. the ancients never
failed through the Straits of Malacca, had no know-
ledge of the island of Sumatra, and were altogether
unacquainted with the Ealtrrn Ocean. If to any of
my readers these opinions appear to be well founded,
the navigation and commerce of the ancients in India
mull be circumscribed within limits still more confined
than those which I have allotted to thein. From the
Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 7. we learn that Cheen was
an ancient name of the kingdom of Pegu; as that
country borders upon Ava, where M. Goffcllin places
the Great Promontory, this near resemblance of names
may appear, perhaps, to confirm his opinion that Sinll
Metropolis was situated on this coast, and not so far
East as M. D'Anville has placed it.

As Ptolemy's geography of this eastern division of

Asia is more erroneous, obscure, and contradiEory
than in any other part of his work, and as all the
manuscripts of it, both Greek and Latin, are remark-
ably incorrcct in the two chapters which contain the
description of the counties beyond the Ganges, M.
)'Anville, in his Memoir concerning the limits of the
world known to the ancients beyond the Ganges, has
admitted into it a larger portion of conjcure than
we find in the other rcfearchcs of that cautious geo-
grapher. I-Ie likcwifc builds more than ufrial upon
the rcfemblaincts between the ancient and mode:'
names of places, though at all times he discovers a
propensity, perhaps too great, to trace these, and to
reft upon then). ThIcfc rcfcmblances are often, indeel,

very

very striking, and have led him to many happy disco-
veries. But in peruing his works, it is impossible, I
fiould think, not to perceive that some which he
mentions are far fetched and fanciful. Whenever I
follow him, I have adopted only such conclusions as
fecm to be eftablified with his accustomed accuracy.

NOTE XXXIV. SECT. II. p. 99.

THE Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ey-
thraan Sea has marked the distances of many of the
places which he mentions, with such accuracy as ren-
ders it a nearer approach, than what is to be found in
any writer us antiquity, to a complete survey of the
coall from 1\Mvos-hornus, on the weft fide of the Ara-
bian Gulf, ..long the fliores of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia,
and Caramania, to the mouth of the Indus, and thence
down the weft co:'.t of the Indian Peninsula to Mlufiris
and Barace. This adds to the value of this flort trea-
tife, which, in every other refpet, pofieffes great
merit. It may be confidered as a remarkable proof of
the extent and accuracy of this Author's intelligence
concerning Indin, that he is the only ancient writer
who appears in any degree to have been acquainted
with the great division of the country, which Itill sub-
sifts, viz. Indo(lan Proper, comprehending the northern
provinces of the Peninsula, and the Deccan, compre-
helding the southern provinces. (" From Barygaza

(t-ys he) the continent stretches to the south; hence

"that dif(ria is called Dachinabades, for, in the

when

when they adopt any foreign name, always gave it a
termination peculiar to their own language, which
the grammatical ftruaure of both tongues rendered,
in some degree, ncceiltiry, it is evident that Dachanos
is the fame with )cccan, which word has frill the
j.me signification, and is still the name of that division
of the Peninsula. The northern limit of the Deccan
at prefett is the river Narbudda, where our Author

THOUGII, in deducing the latitudes of places from

obfcrvations of the fun or stars, the ancient aftrono-
mers ncglected several correcions, which ought to
have been applied, their results were sometimes exad
to a few minutes, but at other times they appear to
have been erroneous to the extent of two, or even
three degrees, and may perhaps be reckoned, one with
another, to have come within half a degree of the
truth. This part of the ancient geography would
therefore have been tolerably accurate, if there had
been a fuflicient number of such determinations. These,
however, were far from being numerous, and appear
to have been confined to some of the more remarkable
places in the countries which surround the Mediterra-
nean sea.

WHE-N, from want of more accurate observations,

the latitude was inferred from the length of the longer
or fiortelt day, no great degree of prccifion was, il
any cafe, to bc cxpeded, and leaif of all in the vicinity

of

of the Equator. An error of a quarter of an hour,
which, without some mode of meafurini time more
accurate than ancient obfcrvers could emplovy, was not
easily avoided, might produce, in such situations, an
error of four degrees in the determination of the
latitude.

WITH refpe& to places in the torrid zone, there

was another resource for determining the lititude.
'This was by observing the time of the year when the
fun was vertical to any place, or when bodies that
iteod perpendicular to the horizon had no iiadow at
noon-day; the fun's diltance from the Equator at that
time, which was known from the principlis of afiro-
iomny, was equal to the latitude of the place. \Ve
have inltances of the application of this method in
the determination of the parallels of Syenc and 5Icroe.
The accuracy 'which this method would admit of,
seems to be limited to about half a degrce, and this
only on the supposition that the observer was f1ationary;
for if lie was travelling from one place to another, and
had not an opportunity of correciing the oblf.'vatin
of one day by that of the day following, he wa likely
to deviate much more considerably from the truth.

WITI- refpeal to the longitude of places, as cclipfes

of the moon are not frequent, and could fhlomi be of
ife for determining it, and only when there were allto-
nonmers to obfervc tlhem Mith accuracy, they may he
left out of the account altogether when we are cx-
alluilling the geography of remoite coulntries. The dif-
ferences of the meridians of places w'we therefore
anciently ascertained entirely by the bearings and dif-

tances

tances of one place from another, and of consequence
ail tlc errors of reckonings, surveys, and itineraries,
fell chiefly upon the longitude, in the famne manner
as 1tappens at prtfcnt in a iiip which has no method
cf deterlmining its longitude, but by comparing the
d(.ad- reckoning with tle obfcrvations of the latitude;
though with this difference, that the errors, to which
the nimolt kilful of the ancient navigators was liable,
wvcre far greater than what the mult ignorant ship-
Iiuailcr of modern times, provided with a conpafs, can
well colmmit. The lcn th of the Mlceiterranan mea-
uiue(d, in degrees of longitude, from t!he Pillars of
HIercules, to the Bay of lfftis, is less than f;rty de-
grees; but in P'tolciny's maps it is more than sixty,
and, in genera], his longitudes, counting from the
mcridian of Al xandria, especially toward the East,
arc erroneous nearly in the fame proportion. It ap-
pears, i!llded, that in remote teas, the coasts were
often delilcated from an imperfed account of the dif-
tanccs failed, witliout the lealt knowledge of the bear-
ings or direction of the ship's course. Ptolemy, it is
true, ufced to make an allowance of about one-third
for the winding of a fllip's course. Geogr. lib. i. c. 12.;
but it is plain, tlhat the application of this general
nuie could seldom lead to an accurate conclusion. Of
this t'here is a firiking inltancc in the form which that
I,''cg' phCr lhas given to the Pcninifula of India. From
thle Bariygazenunm Proniontorium to the place marked
Locus undo folvunt in Chryfen navigantcs, that is,
from Surat on ti h ?ival.bar coast, to about Narfapour
on the Coromaitdel coast, the distance measured along
tle fea-l norc is nearly the fiame witl what it is in rca-
lity ; that is, about five hundred and twenty leagues.

But

But the mistake in the direction is aflonifhing, for the
Malabar and Coromandel codlt, instead of ltretching
to tli south, and intersecting one another at Cape Co-
morin, in a very acute angle, are extended by Ptolemy
almost in the fame traight line from weft to e"ff, de-
clining a little to the south. This coast is, at the fame
time, marked with several bays and promontorics,
nearly resembling, in their position, those which actu-
a!!y exist on it. All these circumstances compared to-
gether, point out very clearly what were the materials
fron- which tLe ancient map of India was conpofed.
The Ihips which had visited the coal] of that country,
had kept an account of the time which they took to
fail from one place to another, and had marked, as
they flood along liore, on what hand the land lay,
when they shaped their course across a bay, or doubled
a promontory. This imperfeE journal, with an inac-
curate account, perhaps, of the latitude of one or two
places, was prbbably all the information concerning
the coast of India, which Ptolemy was able to pro-
cure. That he should have been able to procure no
better information from merchants who failed with no
particular view of exploring the coast, will not appear
wonderful, if we confider that even the celebrated
Periplus of Hanno would not enable a geographer to
lay downl the coast of Africa with more precision, than
Ptolemy has delineated that of India.

authenticity were entertained likewise by several learned

given no notice of the manuscript which he translated,
but that he found it in the library of M. le Comte de
Seignelay. As no person had seen the manuscript
ince that time, the doubts increased, and M. Renaudot
was charged with the crime of imposing upon the pub-
lic. But the Colbert Manuscripts having been deposited
in the King's Library, as (fortunately for literature)
molf private collecions are in France, M. de Guignes,
after a long search, discovered the identical manu-
script to which M. Renaudot refers. It appears to
have been written in the twelfth century; Journal
des Scavans, Dec. 1764, p. 315, &c. As I had not
the French edition of M. Renaudot's book, my refer-
ences are made to the Englifl translation. The Rela-
tion of the two Arabian Travellers is confirmed, in
many points, by their countryman Maffoudi, who
published his treatise on universal history, to which he
gives the fantastical title of " Meadows of Gold, and
" Mines of Jewels," a hundred and fix years after
their time. From him, likewise, we receive such an
account of India in the tenth century, as renders it
evident that the Arabians had then acquired an exten-
fve knowledge of that country. According to his de-
scription, the peninsula of India was divided into four
kingdoms. The firfl was composed of the provinces
situated on the Indus, and the rivers which fall into it;
the capital of which was Moultan. The capital of the
second kingdom was Canoge, which, from the ruins of
it lill remaining, appears to have been a very large
il'y; Reniiell's Memoirs, p. 54. In order to give arn

idea

idea of its populoufiefs, the Indian hi(lorians assert,
that it contained thirty thousand ihops, in which betel.
nut was fold, and sixty thoufind sets of musicians and
fingers, who paid a tax to government; Ferifhta, tranf.
lated by Dow, vol. i. p. 32. The third kingdom was
Cachemire. Maflbudi, as far as I know, is the firit
author who mentions this paradise of India,' of which
he gives a short but just description. The fourth is
the kingdom of Guzerate, which lie represents as the
greatest and molt powerful; and he concurs with the
two Arabian Travellers, in giving the sovereigns of it
the appellation of Balhara. What Maflbudi relates
concerning India is more worthy of notice, as he him-
self had visited that country; Notices et Extraits des
VMamifcrits de la Bibliotheque du Roi, tom..i. p. 9, 10.
Mafloudi confirms what the two Arabian Travellers re-
late, concerning the extraordinary progress of the
Indians in astronomical science. According to his ac-
count, a temple was built during the reign of Brahman,
the first monarch of India, with twelve towers, repre-
senting the twelve signs of the zodiac; and in which
was delineated, a view of all the stars as they appear
in the heavens. In the fame reign was composed the
famous Sind-Hind, which seems to be the ftandatd
treatise of Indian altronomy; Notices, &c. tom. i.
p. 7. Another Arabian author, who wrote about the
middle of the fourteenth century, divides India into
three parts. The northern comprehending all the pro-
vinces on the Indus. The middle, extending from
Guzerate to the Ganges. The southern, which he
denominates Comar, from Cape Comorin; Notices,

THE naval skill of the Chinese seems not to have been
superior to that of the Greeks, the Romans, or Ara-
bians. The course which they held from Canton to
Siraf, near the mouth of the Persian Gulf, is described
by thtir own authors. They kept as near as pofiible to
the fiore until they reached the island of Ceylon, and
then doubling Cape Comorin, they failed along' the
weft fide of the Peninsula, as far as the mouth of the
Indus, and thence fleered along the coast to the plate
of their detlination; Mem. de Literat. tom. xxxii.
p. 367. Some authors have contended, that both the
Arabians and Chinese were well acquainted with the
mariners compass, and the use of it in navigation; but
it is remarkable that in the Arabic, Turkish, and Per-
fian languages there is no original name for the coni-
pass. They commonly call it Bocfa, the Italian name,
which flews that the knowledge of this useful inflru-
nient was communicated to them by the Europeans.
There is not one single. observation, of ancient dnte,
made by the Arabians on the vaiiation of the needle,
or any infliucition deduced from it, for the affitl.nce
of navigatois. Sir John Chardin, one of the most
I'a;rned alnd best informed travellers who has visited
the Ear, having been consulted upon this point, returns
for answer, " 1 boldly aflert, that the Asiatics are be.
' holden to us for this wonderful instrument, whiicl
"they bad from Europe a long time before the Portu-
' lgufe conquelts. For, filft, their compafles are ex-

'" aly like ours, and they buy them of Europeans as

c c " much

"much as they can, scarce daring to meddle with their
" needles themselves. Secondly, it is certain that the
"old navigators only coasted' it along, which I impute
" to their want of this initrument to guide and in-
' ftrua them in the middle of the ocean. We can-
" not pretend to fay that they were afraid of venturing

far from home, for the Arabians, the first naviga-

' tors in the world, in my opinion, at least for the
"Eastern seas, have, time out of mind, failed from
" the bottom of the Red Sea, all along the coast of
" Africa; and the Chinese have always traded with
' Java and Sumatra, which is a very considerable

voyage. So many islands uninhabited and yet pro-

' dulive, so many lands unknown to the people I
' speak of, are a proof that the old navigators had not
" the art of failing on the main sea. I have nothing but
"argument to offer touching this matter, having never
" met with any person in Persia or the Indies to in-
" form me when the compass was first known among
( them, though I made inquiry of the most learned
' men in both countries. I have failed from the Indies
( to Persia in Indian ships, when no European bas
" been aboard but myself. The pilots were all In.

dians, and they used the fore-ftafF and quadrant for

" their observations. These instruments they have
' from us, and made by our artists, and they do not
" in the lear vary from ours, except that the charac-
( tcrs are Arabic. The Arabians are the most skilful
" navigators of all the Asiatics or Africans ; but nei-
" ther thcy nor the Indians make use of charts; and
" they do not much vi anwt them: rome they have, but

they are copicd from ours, for they are altogether

Vafa Murrhina were formed of a transparent stone, dug
out of the earth in some of the Eastern provinces of

THE Eanern parts of Asia are now so completely

explored, that the first imperfect accounts of them, by
Mlarco Polo, attra& little of that attention which was
originally excited by the publication of his travels;
and some circumstances in his narrative have induced
different authors to juflify this neglect, by calling in
quefltion the truth of what he relates, andeven to a-
fert that he had never visited those countries which he
pretends to dcfcribe. He does not, fay they, ascertain
the pofiticn of any one placc, by specifying its longi-
tude or latitude. He. gives names to provinces ard
cities, particularly in his lefeription of Cathay, whicl
have n( rcfemblancc to those which they now bear.
We may obfi:r\e, lowevcr, that as Marco Polo feecnls

to

to have been, in no degree, a man of science, it was
not to be expeEted that he should fix the poftion of
places with geographical accuracy. As he travelled
through China, either in the suite of the great Khan,
or in execution of his orders, it is probable that the
names which he gives to different provinces and cities,
are those by which they were known to the Tartars,
in whose service he was, not their original Chinese
names. Some inaccuracies which have been observed
in the relation of his travels, may be accounted for,
by attending to one circumstance, that it was not pub-
lilhed from a regular journal, which, perhaps, the
viciflitudes in his situation, during such a long series
of adventures, did not permit him to keep, or to pre-
serve. It was composed after his return to his native
country, and chiefly from recolledion. But notwith-
flanding this disadvantage, his account of those re-
gions of the East, towards which my inquiries have
been directed, contains information with refpedt to
several particulars, altogether unknown in Europe at
that time, the accuracy of which is now fully con-
firmed. Mr. Marfden, whose accuracy and discern.
ment are well known, traces his description of the
island which he calls Java minor, evidently Sumatra;
from which it is apparent that, as Marco Polo had rc-
fided a considerable time in that island, he had exa-
mined some parts with care, and had inquired withl
diligence concerning others. }Iift. of Sumat. p. 28r.
I fliall mention some other particulars with refpe6t to

of the country, and conveyed thence, together with
pepper, and other producions peculiar to that part of
India, by ahips which arrived from the Red Sea.
Lib. iii. c. 27. This, perhaps, may account for the
superior quality which Sanudo aferibes to the goods
brought to the coast of Syria from the Persian Gulf,
above those imported into Egypt by the Red Sea. The
former were chosen and purchased in the places where
thcy grew, or where they were manufactured, by the
mercihants of Pcrlia, who still continued their voyages
to every part of tlh Eaf ; while the Egyptian mer-
chants, in making up their cargoes, depended upon
the aflbrtment of goods brought to the Malabar coalt
by the natives. To some persons in his own age, what

public-fpirited effort of the citizens, in order to sup.
port their country at a dangerous crisis. Of such laud.
able exertions, there are several flriking instances in
the history of the republic. In the year 1319, when
the Genoese, after obtaining a great naval victory over
the Venetians, were ready to attack their capital, the
citizens, by a voluntary contribution, enabled the fe.
nate to fit out such a powerful armament as saved their
country. Sabellicus, HIifl. Rer. Vcnet. Dec. ii. lib. vi.
p. 385. 3900 In the war with Ferrara, which began
in the year 1472, the senate, relying upon the attach-
ment of the citizens to their country, required them
to bring all their gold and silver plate, and jewels, into
the public treasury, upon promise of paying the value
of them at the conclusion of the war, with five per
cent. of interest; and this requisition was complied
with cheerfully. Petr. Cyrnaus de Bello Ferrar. ap.

Two fa&s may be mentioned as proofs of an extra-

ordinary extension of the Venetian trade at this period.
-- x. There is in Rymer's Great Colledtion, a series
of grants from the kings of England, of various pri-
vileges and immunities to Venetian merchants trading
in England, as well as several commercial treaties with
the republic, which plainly indicate a considerable in-
crease of their tranfaftions in that country. These are
mentioned in their order by Mr. Anderson, to whole

patient

patient industry and found understanding, every person
engaged in any commercial research mult have felt
himlfelf greatly indebted on many occalions.-- 2. The
eftabliihment of a Bank by public authority, the credit
of which was founded on that of the aate. In an age
and nation so well acquainted with the advantages
which commerce derives from the illtitution of banks,
it is unieceffary to enumerate tlemn. Mercantile tranf-
afions nmuf have been numerous and extenlivc before
the utility of such an inllitution could be- fully per-
ceived, or the principles of trade could be so fully un-
dlerltood as to form the regulations proper for condu&-
ing it with success. Venice may boast of having given
the firfl example to Europe of an establishment alto-
gether unknown to the ancients, and which is the pride
of the modern commercial fyftcm. The constitution
of the Bank of Venice was originally founded on such
just principles, that it has served as a model in the efta-
blifhment of banks in other countries, and the admini-
ftration of its affairs has been conducaed with so much
integrity, that its credit has never been flaken. I can,
not specify the precise year in which the Bank of Ve-
nice was eflablifled by.a law of the State. Anderson

AN Italian author of good credit, and a diligent in-

in

in the Mediterrancan had united together, Venice alone
would have been superior to them all, in naval power,
and in extent of commerce. Denina Revolutions

MIocenigo gives a view of the naval force of the repub.
lic, which confirms this decision of Denina. At that
time it con rCied of three thousand trading vessels, of
various dimensions, on board which were employed
seventeen thousand sailors; of three hundred {hips of
greater force, manned by eight thouf.ind sailors; and
cf forty-five large galeaflks, or carracks, navigated by
eleven thousand sailors. In public and private arfena!s
sixteen thousand carpenters were employed. Mar. S.-

DeJfrt, the most dreary waftes are traversed, and the
nations which they disjoin are enabled to trade with

any other animal, the camel performs with astonishing
dispatch. Under heavy burdens of fix, seven, and
eight hundred weight, they can continue their march
during a long period of time, with little food or reft,
and sometimes without tailing water for eight or nine
days. By the wife ceconomy of Providence, the camel
seens formed of ptrpofe to be the beast of burden in
those regions where he is placed, and where his ser-
vice is moit wanted. In all the diftr'iis of Asia and
Africa, where deserts are molt frequent and extensive,
the camel abounds. This is his proper station, and
beyond this the sphere of his activity does not extend
far. He dreads alike the excesses of heat and of cold,
and does not agree even with the mild climate of our
temperate zone. As the firfl trade in Indian com-
mod(ities, of which we have any authentic account,
was carried on by means of camels, Genesis, xxxvii.

the manner in which the camrel performs its journeys,
which may be agreeable to some of my readers. "In

employed, because they consume little, and carry a

c hundred and fifty pounds; his food, whatever is

barley, &c. With a pound of food a day, and as

cc much water, he will travel for weeks. In the jour.
" ney from Cairo to Suez, which is forty or forty-fix
"hours, they neither eat nor drink; but these long
" fasts, if often repeated, wear them out. Their

IN order to give an adequate idea of the extensive

circulation of Indian conmmodities by land-carriage, it
would be neccffary to trace the ruute, and to efliniate
the number, of the various caravan:, by which they are
conveyed. Could this be executed with accuracy, it
would be a curious fubjcE of geographical research, as
well as a valuable addition to commercial hiltory.

uniformly fludied in conducting this Disquisition, to
enter into a detail of so great length, it may be proper
here, for illtuirating this part of my fiubjec, to take
lfuch a view of two caravans which visit Mecca, as may
enable my readers to eflimate more justly the magnitude
of their commercial tranfa6cions. The first is the
caravan which takes its departure from Cairo in Egypt,
and the other from Damascus in Syria; and I feleQ
these, both becauft they are the must confiderablc,
and because they are described by authors of undoubted
credit, who had the befl opportunities of receiving full
information concerning them. The former is composed
not only of pilgrims from every part of Egypt, but of
those which arrive from all the finall Mahomedan fates
on the African coast of the Mediterranean, from the em-
pire of Morocco, and even from the Negroe kingdoms
on the Atlantic. When assembled, the caravan conffiis
at lealf of fifty thousand persons, and the number of
camels employed in carrying w;;tcr, provisions, and
merchandize, is still greater. The journey, which, in
going from Cairo, and returning thither, is not com-
pleted in less than a hundred days, is peiformed wholly
by land; and as the route lies mostly through sandy
(leferts, or barren uninhabited wils, which fcldorn as-
ford any fubfilence, and where often no sources of
water cani be found, the pilgrims always undergo much
fitiguc, and fometiines mufti endure incredih!e hard-
snips. An early and good description of this caravan
is publ:fhed by Hakluyt, vol. ii. p. 202, &c. Mlillet

rate estimate, the distance between the two cities, by

part of the journey is through a desert, and the pil-
grims not only endure much fatigue, but are often
exposed to great danger from the wild Arabs. Ie.
moirs, p. 114, &c. It is a singular proof of the pre-
datory spirit of the Arabs, that although all their inde-
pendent tribes are zca}ous aliahomedans, yet they make
no Icruple of plundering the caravans of pilgrims, while
engaged in performing one of the most indispensable
dcItics of their religion. A rem;arkable instance of this

fuppole that all the pilgrims who visit Mecca belong
to them; such ccifidelrable additions are received from
the extensive dominions of Persia, from every province

Ahvfliti, from vatrioi ftatcs on the Southern coast of
.\lrica;, andl from a.nll parts of Arabia, that when tlhe

whole

whole are assembled they have been computed to
amount to two hundred thousand. In some years the
number is farther increased by small bands of pilgrims
from several interior provinces of Africa, the names
and situations of which are just beginning to be known
in Europe. For this last fa&t we are indebted to the
Aflbciation for promoting the Discovery of the Interior
Parts of Africa, formed by some British Gentlemen,
upon principles so liberal, and with views so public-
spirited, as do honour to themselves and to their
country. Proceedings, &c. p. xI4.

IN the Report of the Committee of the Privy Council

on the Slave Trade, other particulars are contained;
and it appears that the commerce carried on by caravans
in the interior parts of Africa is not only widely ex-
tended, but of considerable value. Besides the great
caravan which proceeds to Cairo, and is joined by
Mahomedan pilgrims from every part of Africa, there
are caravans which have no object but commerce,
which set out from Fez, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and
other flates on the sea coast, and penetrate far into
the interior country. Some of them take no less than
fifty days to reach the place of their destination; and,
as the medium of their rate of travelling may be eRti-
nmated at about eighteen miles a-day, the extent of their
journey may be easily computed. As both the time of
their outlft, and their route, are known, they are met
by the people of all the countries through which thry
tranvl, who trade with them. Indian goods of every
kindi form a conriderable article in this traffic, in cx-
hll.ige for vhich the chief commodity they can give is
flia '. ;Part vi.

D 3 As

As the journeys of the caravans, which are purely

commercial, do not commence at fated seasons, and
their routes vary according to the convenience or fancy
of the merchants of whom they are composed, a de-
fcripticn cannot be given of them with the fame degree
of accuracy as of the great caravans which visit Mecca.
But by attending to the accounts of some authors, and
the occasional hints of others, fuficicnt information
may be gathered to satisfy us, that the circulation of
Eastern goods by these caravans is very extensive. The
fame intercourse which was anciently kept up by the
provinces in the North-east of Asia with Indoftan and
China, and which I formerly described, still subsists.
Among all the numerous tribes of Tartars, even of
those which retain their pastoral manners in greatefl
purity, the demand for the productions of these two
countries is very considerable. Voyages de Pallas,
tom. i. p. 357, &c. torn. ii. p. 422. In order to sup-
ply them with there, caravans set out annually from
Boghar, (Hackluyt, vol. i. p. 332.) Samarcand, Thi-
bet, and several other places, and return with large
cargoes of Indian and Chinese goods. But the trade
carried on between Rufnia and China, in this part of
Asia, is by far the molt extensive and Left knownl.
Some connexion of this kind, it is probable, was kept
up between them from the earliest period, but it in
creased greatly after the interior parts of Ruflia were
rendered more accelfible by the conquests of Zingis
Khan and Tamrnrlane. The commercial nations of
Europe were so well acquainted with the mode of car-
rying on this triale, that soon after the Portuguese hlad
opened the communication with the East by the Cape
of Good liope, aln attempt was made, in order to 'i-

*niiiii

Ainilh the advantages which they derived from this
discovery, to prevail on the Ruffians to convey Indian
and Cliinfe commodities through the whole extent of
their empire, partly by land-carriage and partly by
nmeCals of navigable rivers, to some port on the Baltic,
from wlich they might be diitributed through every
part of Europe. Ramufio Raccolto da Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 3741 B. Hist. du Commerce de la Ruflie, par M.
Schreder, tom. i. p. 13, 14. This scheme, too great for
the monarch then on the throne of Russia to carry into
execution, was rendered practicable by the conquests of
Ivan Bafilowitz, and the genius of Peter the Great.
Though the capitals of the two empires were situated
at the immense distance of fix thousand three hundred
and feventy-eight miles from each other, and the route
lay for above four hundred miles through an unin-
habited desert, (Bell's Travels, vol. ii. p. 167.) cara-
vans travelled from the one to the other. But though
it had been ftipuuated, when this intercourse was efta-
bliflhed, that the number of persons in each caravan
flould not exceed two hundred, and though they were
fliut up within the walls of a Caravanfcrai during the
fihort time they were sufFered to remain in Pekin, and
were allowed to deal only with a few merchants, to
whom a monopoly of the trade with them had been
granted; yet, notwithitanding all these restraints and
precautions, the jealous vigilance with which the Chi-
nefe government excludes foreigners from a free inter-
courfc with its subjects, was alarmed, and the admifion
of the Ruffian caravans into the empire was soon pro-
hibited. After various negotiations, an expedient was
;it length d(vifed, by which the advantages of mutual
Lcontmerce were secured, without infringing the caun

p D 4 'ious

tious arrangements of Chinese policy. On the bound.
ary of the two empires, two small towns were built
almost contiguous, Kiachta inhabited by Ruffians,
and Maimatfchin by Chinese. To these all the mar.
ketable productions of their respective countries are
brought by the fubjets of each empire; and the furs,
the linen and woollen cloth, the leather, the glass, &c.
of Russia, are exchanged for the silk, the cotton, the tea,
the rice, the toys, &c. of China. By some well-judged
conceiEtons of the sovereign now feated on the throne
of Ruflia, whose enlarged mind is superior to the illi.
beral maxims of many of her predeceflors, this trade is
rendered so flourishing, that its amount annually is not
less than eight hundred thousand pounds flerling, and
it is the only trade which China carries on almost en-
tirely by barter. Mr. Coxe, in his account of the Ruf-
fian discoveries, has collected, with his usual attention
and discernment, every thing relative to this branch of
trade, the nature and extent of which were little known
in Europe. Part ii. chap. ii, iii, iv. Nor is Iachta
the only place where Russia receives Chinese and In-
dian commodities. A considerably supply of both is

THE only voyage of discovery in the Atlantic Ocean

towards the South, by any of the ancient commercial
states in the Mediterranean, is that of llanno, under-
taken by order of the republic of Carthage. As the
fuiuation of that city, so much nearer the Straits than
Tyre, Alexandria, and the other feats of ancient trade
which have been mentioned, gave it more immediate
access to the ocean; that circumstance, together with
the various settlements which the Carthaginians had
made in different provinces of Spain, naturally fug-
gc{(cd to them this enterprise, and afforded them the
profped of confiderdble advantages from its success.
The voyage of Hanno, instead of invalidating, seems to
confirm the justness of the reasons which have been
given, why no similar attempt was made by the other
commercial states in the Mediterranean.

'I'ouclI the intelligent authors whom I have quoted

confidered this voyage of the Phenicians as fabulous,
lIerodotus mentions a circumflance concerning it,
lhich seems to prove that it had really been performed.
" The Phenicians," fays lie, " affirmed thait, in fail-
"ing round Africa, they had the fun on their right
" hand, which to me appears not to be credible,
"though it may be deemed so by others." Lib. iv.
c. 42. This, it is certain, muit have happened, if they

really

really accomplished such a voyage. The science of
astronomy, however, was in that early period so im-
perfect, that it was by experience only that.the Phe-
nicians could come at the knowledge of this fat;
they durst not, without this, have ventured to aflirt what
would have appeared to be an improbable fiEtion. Even
after what they related, Herodotus dilbelieved it.

NOTE LVII. SECT. IV. p. 205.

NOTWITHSTANDING this incrcafing demand for the

productions of India, it is remarkable, that during the
sixteenth century some commodities which are now
the chief articles of importation from the East, were
either altogether unknown, or of little account. Tea,
the importation of which, at present, far exceeds that
of any other production of the East, has not been in
general use, in any country of Europe, a full century;
and yet, during that fliort period, from some singular
caprice of taste, or power of fafihion, the infusion of a
leaf brought from the farthe(t extremity of the earth,
of which it is perhaps the highest praise to fay that it
is innoxious, has become almost a necessary of life in
several parts of Europe, and the pa(lion for it descends
from the most elevated to the lowed orders in society.
In 1785 it was computed that the whole quantity of
tea imported into Europe from China was about nine-
teen millions of pounds, of which it is conjecured that
twelve millions were consumed in Great Britain andl
the dominions depending upon it. Dodfley's Annual
Regifler for 1784 and 1785, p. 156. In 1789 twenty-
one millions of pounds were imported. The porcelain

of

of China, now as common in many parts of Europe
as if it were of domestic manufacture, was not known
to the ancients. Marco Polo is the first among the
moderns who mentions it. The Portuguese began to
import it not long after their first voyage to China,
A.D. 1517; but it was a considerable time before the
use of it became extensive.

ACCORDING to all the writers of antiquity, the In-
lians are said to be divided into seven tribes or carts.

p. 153, &c. Arrian. Indic. c. io. They were led into
this error, it is pr,,bable, by confidering some of the sub-
divisions of the catts, as if they had been a diftint in-
depcndenit order. But that there were no more than
four original caRs, we learn from the concurrent tef-
timony of the best informed modern travellers. A
molt d;ftina account of these we have in " La Porte
"Ouverte, ou la vraye Representation de la Vie,
" des Mceurs, de la Religion, et du Service des Bra-

mines, qui demeurent fur lesCoftes deChoromandel,"

&c. This was compiled before the middle of last cen-
tury, by Abraham Roger, chaplain of the Dutch sac-
tory at Pullicate. By gaining the confidence of an
intelligent Brahmin, he acquired information concerning
the manners and religion of the Indians, more authen-
tic and extensive than was known to Europeans prior
to the late translations from the Sanlkreet language.
I mention this book, because it seems to be less known
than it deserves to be. There remains now no doubt

with

with respect either to the number or the fundious of
the casts, as both are afccrtained from the most an.
cient and sacrcd books of the Hindoos, and confirmed
by the accounts of their own inflitutions, given by
Brahmins eminent for their learning. According to
them, the different carls proceeded from Brahma, the
immediate ag,:nt of the creation under the Supreme
Power, inl the following manner, which establishes
both the rank which they were to hold, and the office
which they were required to perform.
The Brahmin, front the mouth (wisdom); To pray,

to read, to inflruct.
The Chehterce, from the arms (strength): To draw

the bow, to fight, to govern.
The Bice, from the belly or thighs (nourishment): To

provide the necefEaries of life by agriculture and
tra ffic.
The Sooder, from the feet (fubjeaion): To labour,

to serve.

THE prescribed occupations of all these classes are

cflential in a well-regulated fiate. Subordinate to
them is a fifth, or adventitious class, denominated Jiur-
run Sunker, supposed to I)e the offspring of an unlawful
union between persons of diflerent cafls. These are
.mofly dealtrs in petty articles of retail trade. Preface
to the Code of Centoo Laws, p. xlvi. and xcix. This
adventitious cafi is not mentioned, as far as I know, by
aliy European author. The diftinaion was too nice
to be olfcrved by them, and they seem to confder the
memberr of this cast as belonging to the Sooder.

Bcfidcs

Betides these acknowledged casts, there is a race of
unhappy men, denominated, on the Coromandel coast,
Pariars, and, in other parts of India, Chandalar. These
are out-casts from their original order, who, by their
misconduCt, have forfeited all the privileges of it.
Their condition is, undoubtedly, the lowefl degradation
of human nature. No pcrfoin of any cast will have
the least communication with them. Sonnerat, tom. i.
p. 55, 56. If a Pariar approach a Nayr, i. e. a warrior
of high caRt, on the Malabar coast, he may put him to
death with impunity. Water or milk are confidered
as defiled even by their shadow pafling over them, and
cannot be used until they are purified. Ayeen Akbery,
vol. iii. p. 243. It is almost impoflible for words to
express the sensation of vileness that the name of Pariar
or Chandala conveys to the mind of a Hindoo. Every
lIindoo who violates the rules or institutions of his
cast finks into this degraded situation. This it is which
renders Hindoos so resolute in adhering to the infti-
tutions of their tribe, because the loss of calf is, to
them, the loss of all human comfort and refpeEtability )
and is a punishment, beyond comparison, more severe
than excommunication in the mol: triumphant period
of Papal power.

THE four original cafls are named, and their funictons

described in the Mahabarat, the most ancient book of the
Hindoos, and of higher authority than any with which
Europeans are hitherto acquainted. Baghvat-Geeta,
P. 130. The fame diflinction of calls was known to
the author of Heeto-pades, another work of confider.,
able antiquity, translated from the Sanfcreet, p. 251.

THE

THE mention of one circumstance refpeoting the

ditlination of carts has been omitted in the text.
Though the line of separation be so drawn, as to render
the ascent from an inferior to a higher cast abfblutely im-
possible, and it would be regarded as a most enormous
impiety, if one in a lower order (hould presume to
perform any function belonging to those of a superior
cast; yet, in certain cafes, the Pundits declare it to be
lawful for persons of a high class to exercise some of
the occupations allotted to a class below their own,
without losing their cast by doing so. Pref. of Pundits
to the Code of Gentoo La*s, p. ioo. Accordingly
we find Brahmins employed in the service of their
princes, not only as ministers of Itate, Orme's Frag-
ments, p. 207, but in subordinate stations. Molt of
the officers of high rank in the army of Sevagi, the
founder of the lvahratta slate, were Brahmins, and
some of them Pundits or learned Brahmins. Ibid.
p. 97. Hurry Punt and Purferam Bhow, who com-
manded the Mahratta forces, which aEted in con-
junftion with the army of Lord Cornwallis against
Tippoo Saib, were Brahmins. Many Seapoys in the
service of the East India Company, particularly in the
Bengal presidency, are of the Brahmin calt.

ANOTHER fa&t concerning the catls deserves notice.

An imnmenfc number of pilgrims, amounting, in some
years, to more than iSo,ooo, visit the Pagoda of Jag-
gernaut in Orifa, (one of the most ancient and molf
revered places of Ilindoo worship,) at the time of the
annual festival in honour of the deity to whom the
temple is consecrated. The members of all the four
calls are allowed promiscuously to approach the altar

of

of the idol, and feating themselves without diftinCton,
eat indiscriminate of the fame food. This seems to
indicate some remembrance of a state prior to the
iiltitution of casts, when all men were confidered as
equal. I have not such information as enables me to
account for a pradice so repugnant to the first ideas
and principles of the Hindoos, either sacred or civil.

not mentioned the numerous orders of Indian devotees,
to 1ll of whom European writers give the appellation
of Fqnirs ; a name by which the Mahomedans dif-
tinOguith fnmtical monks of their own religion. The
light in which I have viewed the religious institutions
of the Hindoos, did not render it neceflary that I flould
confider the Indian Faquirs particularly. Thtir num-
ber, the rigour of their mortifications, the excruciating
penances which they voluntarily undergo, and the
ligh opinion which the people entertain of their fanc-
tity, have struck all travellers who have visited India,
and their descriptions of them are well known. The
powerful influeilce of erthufiafm, t!he love of
diflinction, and the desire of obtaining fomn portion
of that reverence and those honours whichl tlie B3r'lh-
mins are born to enjoy, may account for all the ex-
traordinary things which they do and fusiler. One
particular concerning them merits notice. Tlhis order
of devotees appears to have been very ancient in India.
FlTe description of the Gc;rmrani, which Strabo takes
from Megaflhenes, applies, almost in every circum-
ftancc, to the modern Faquirs. Lib. xv. p. o40.o B.

WHAT I have aflerted in the text is in general well.

founded. It is the opinion, however, of gentlemen
who have fecn much of India, and who observcd all
they saw with a difccrning eye, that the conqucets both
of the Mahomedans and of the Europeans have had
some effed upon the manners and cufloms of the na-
tives. They imagine that the dress which the Hinti
doos now wear, the turban, the jummah, and long
drawers, is an imitation of that worn by their Maho.
mnedan conquerors. The ancient dress of the In-
(i.ans, as described by Arrian, Hifl. Indic. c. 16. was
a muslin cloth thrown loosely about their shoulders,
a muslin iirt reaching to the middle of the leg, and
their beards were dyed various colours; which is not
the fa.me with that usrd at present. The cullom
of secluding women, and the tfriElnefs with which
they are confined, is likewise supposcd to have been in.
troduced by the Mahomedans. This supposition is in
some ncaffure confirmed by the drama of Sacontala,
tranflnted from the Sanfkrcet. In that play, fevcral
female characters are introduced, who mingle in so-
ciety and converse as freely witli men, as women are
accuflored to do in Europe. The author, we may
profumc, dcfcribes the manners, and adheres to the
cunfoms of liis own age. 1But while I mention this
rcmiark, it is proper, likewise, to observe, that, from
a paffgc in Strabo, there is reason to think, that,,in
the age of Alexander the Great, women in India were
guarded with the fime jealous attention as at present,

THAT the monarchs of India were the sole proprie,

tors of land, is afierted in most explicit terms bythe
ancients. The people (fay they) pay a land*tax to

p. 153. This was not peculiar to Ihdia. In all the
great monarichies of the East, 'the sole property of land'
seems to be vested in the sovereign as lord paramount.
According to Chardin, this is the state of property in
Persia, and lands were let by the monarch to the
farmers who cultivated them, oh conditions nearly re-
fembling those granted to the Indian Ryot's. Voy-
ages, tom. iii. p. 339, &c. 4to. M. Volney gives a
similar account of the tenure by which lands are held
in one of the great provinces of the Turkish empire.
Voy. en Syrie, &c. tom. ii. p. 369, &c. The precise
mode, however, in which the Ryots of Indoftan held
their poffeflions, is a circumstance in its ancient politi-
cal constitution, with refpea to which gentlemen of
superior discernment, who have resided long in the
country, and filled some of the highest stations in go-
vernment, have formed very different opinions. Some
have imagined that grants of land were made by the
sovereign to villages' or small communities, the inha-
bitants of which, under the direction ot their own
chiefs or heads-men, laboured it in common, and di-
vided the produce of it a'mng them in certain propor-
tions. Defcript. de 1'Inde, par M. Bernouilli, tom. ii.
223, &c. Others maintain, that the property of land
has been transferred from the crown-to hereditary offi-
cers of great 'eminence and power, denominated Ze.
min)dars, who collect the rents from the Ryots, and
parcel out the lands among them. Others contend,
that the office of the Zemindars is temporary and mi-
nifterial, that they are m. rtly colletors of revenue, re-
move:able at pleasure, and the tenure by which the Ityots
11old their pnf^fflions is derived immediately from the
iOv\ereign. This last opinion is supported with great

of Zemindary tenures in the landed property of Ben.
gal, &c. This question fRill continues to be agitated
in Bengal, and such plausible arguments have been
produced in support of the different opinions, that
although it be a point extremely interesting, as the fu-
ture system of British finance in India appears likely
to hinge, in an essential degree, upon it, persons
well acquainted with the state of India, have not been
able to form a final and fatisfafory opinion upon
this fubje&. Captain Kirkpatrick's Introd. to the In-

: 130. Though the sentiments of the Committee of
Revetue, composed of persons eminent for their abi-
fltis, lean to a conclusion against the hereditary right
of thelZemindars in the foil, .yet the Supreme Council,
in the year 1786, declined, for good reasons, to give
any deci4ve judgment on a fubjeat of such magnitude.
This .lote was sent to the pr.ess before I had it in
my power to peruse Mr. Rouse's ingenious and in-
ifru~tive Dissertation concerning the landed property of
Bengal. In it he adoptsan opinlionicontrary to that
of Mr. G.ralt, and maintains, with that candpur and
liberality of sentiment which are always conspicuous
where there is no other objea in view but the discovery
of truth, that the Zemindars of Bengal posiess their
landedl property by' hereditary right. Were I possessed
of such knowledge, either of the fiate of India, or of
the fyflem of adminiflration eftablifned there, as would
be requisite for comparing these different theories, and
deterrmining which.of them merits the preference, the
rubjea of my.refearches does not render it necessary to

enter

enter into such a disquisition. I imagine,' however,
that the state of landed property in India .mighit be
greatly illustrated by an accurate comparison of it-rith
the nature of feudal tenures; and I apprehend that
there might be traced there a succession of changes
taking place, in much the f.lnc ordler as has; bee- ob-
served in Europe, frem wh;ich it miglit appear, that
the poflcfIion of land vas granted at irftl during plea-
sure, :!fteiwairs for life, and at length became perpe-
tual anl hereditary property. But even under this Idlt
form, when land is acquired either by purchase or in-
hcritance, the manner in which tle right of property
is confirmed and rendered complete, in Europe by a
Charter, in India by a Sunnud from the sovereign, seems
to point out what was its original state. According to
each of the theories which I have mentioned, the te-
nure and condition of the Ryots nearly resemble the
dcfcription which I have given of them. Thleir state,. we
learn from the accountsiof intelligent obfervers,-:is as
happy and independent as falls to the lot of any tace of
men employed in the cultivation of the earth. The
ancient Greek and Roman writers, whose acquaintance
with the interior parts of India was very imperfea,re-
present the fourth part of the annual produce of land as
the general average of rent paid to the sovereign. Upon
the authority of a popular author who flourished in
Indi. prior to the Chriflian .era, we may concli.de that
a sixth part of the people's income was, in his time,
the usual portion of the sovereign. Sacontala, AEQ V.
P1. 3. It is now known that what the sovereign re-
cicves from land varies greatly in (different part& of the
country, and is regulated by the fertility or baryennafs

E £ 3 of

of the foil, the nature of the climate, the abundance
or scarcity of water, and many other obvious circum.
stances. By the account given of it, I should imagine
that, in some diitri&s, it has been raised beyond its'
due proportion. One circumstance with refpe¢t to the
administration of revenue in Bengal merits notice, as it
redounds to the honour of the Emperor Akber, the
wifdoin of whose government I have often had occasion
to celebrate. A general and regular aflefiment of re-
venue in Bengal was formed in his reign. All the
lands were then valued, and the rent of each inhabit-
ant and of each village ascertained. A regular grada-
tion of accounts was eftabliied. The rents of the
different inhabitants who lived in one neighbourhood
being colleEted together, formed the account of a village;
the rents of several villages being next collected into one
view, formed the accounts of a larger portion of land.
The aggregate of these accounts exhibited the rent of
a diftriOt, and the fum total of the rents of all the
diftrics in Bengal, formed the iccount of the revenue
of the whole province. Frdm the reign of Akber to
the government of Jaffeer Ali Cawn, A. D. 1757, the
annual amount of revenue, and the modes of levying
it, continued with little variation. But in order to
raise the fum which he had flipulated to pay the Englifl
on his elevation, be departed from the wife arrange-
ments of Akber; many new modes of assessment were
introduced, and examions multiplied.

Indoftan, five hundred miles. Along each fide of the
road between these two great cities, there is planted a

which (whether we confider its extent, its beauty, or
utility in a hot climate) there is nothing similar in any
country. Rennell's Memoir, p. 69.

NOTE LXIII. p. 250.

WE cannot place the equitable and mild government

of Akber in a point of view more advantageous, than
by contrasting it with the condunt of other Mahomedan
princes. In no country did this contrast ever appear
more ifriking than in India. In the thousandth year
of the Christian ;ra, Mahmud of Ghazna, to whose
dominion were fubjetdd the fame countries which
formed the ancient kingdom of Baaria, invaded In-
doftan. Every ftep of his progress in it was marked with
blood and desolation. The most celebrated pagodas,
the ancient monuments of Hindoo devotion and mag-
nificence, were destroyed, the ministers of religion were
inafllcred, and with undiftinguifhing ferocity the coun-
try was laid waste, and the cities were plundered and
burnt. About four hundred years after, Mahmud, Timur,
or Tamerlane, a conqueror of higher fame, turned his
irresistible arms againlt Indoflan; .and, though born in
an age more improved, he not only equalled, but often
so far surpassed the cruel deeds of Mahmud, as to be
justly branded with the odious name of the " Destroy.
" ing Prince," which was given to him by the Hin-
d(oos, the undefcrving viimns of his rage. A rapid,

but striking description of their devastations may be
found in Mr. Orme's Dillertation on the Eflabliflments
made by the Mahomedan conquerors in Indoftan. A
more full account of them is given by Mr. Gibbon,
vol. v. p. 646. vol. vi. p. 339, &c. The arrogant
contempt with which bigotted M.homedans view all
the nations who have not embraced the religion of the
prophet, will account for the unrelenting rigour of Mah-
mud and Timur towards the Hindoos, and greatly en.
hdnces the merit of the tolerant spirit and moderation
with which Akber governed his fubjeds. What im-
prefion the mild adminiftr.ition of Akber made upon
the Ilindoos, we learn from a beautiful letter of Jeff.

I HAVE not attempted a description of any fubterrane-

ous excavations but those of Elephanta, because none of
them have been so often visited, or so carefully infpeaed.
In several parts of India, there are, however, flupen-
dous works of a similar nature. The extent and mag-
nificence of the excavations in the island of Salfetta are
such, that the artist employed by Governor Boon to
tnake drawings of them, aflerted that it would require
the labour of forty thousand men for forty years to
finifl them. Archxeologia, vol. vii. p. 336. Loose as
this mode of eftination may be, it conveys an idea of
the impreflion which the view of them made upon his

Aurungabad, are likewise hewn out of the solid rock1
and if they do not equal thofc of Elephanta and Sal-

fetta

fetta in magnitude, they surpass them far in their ex.

INDIA, fays Strabo, produces a variety of fubfrances

which dye the molt admirable colours. That the ln-
diceim, which produced the beautiful blue colour, is
the f.ime with the Indigo of the moderns, we may
conclude not only from the resemblance of the name,
and tle similarity of the effeas, but from the defcrip-
tion given by Pliny in the passage which I have quoted
in the text. He knew that it was a preparation of a
vegetable substance, though he was ill-informed both
concerning the plant itself, and the process by which
it was fitted for use, which will not appear surprising,
when we recolle& the account formerly given of the

As Sanfkreet literature is altogether a new acqui-

fition to Europe, Baghvat-Geeta, the firIt translation
from that language, having been published so late as
A. D. 1 78, it is intimately connetcd with the subjea
of my inquiries, and may afford entertainment to rome
of my readers, after having reviewed in the text, with
a greater degree of critical attention, the two Sanfkreet
works most worthy of notice, to givc here a succinct
account of other compolitions in that tongue with
hliich we have been made acquainted. The extensive

ufa

use of the Sanfkrcet language is a circumstance which
merits particular attention. " 'The grand source, of
", Indian literature," (fLys Mr. Halhed, the first Eng.
lifhman who acquired the knowledge of Sanikreet,)
" the parent of almost every dialeEt from the Persian

gulf to the China seas, is the S;iifkreet, a language
" of the most venerable and unfathomable antiquity;

which, although, at present, shut up in the libraries

', of Brahmilns, and appropriated solely to the records
" of their religion, appears to have been current over

most of the Oriental world; and traces of its origi-

" nal extent may still be discovered in almost every
" distriCt of Aia. I have been often lftonifled to find
" the similitude of Sanklreet words with those of Per-
' fian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek; and
:' those not in technical and metaphorical terms, which
' the mutuation of refined arts and improved man-
" ners might have occasionally introduced, but in the
:' ground-work of language, in monosyllables, in the
I' names of numbers, and the appellations of such

things as would be first discriminated on the imme-

" diate dawn of civilization. The resemblance which
' may be observed in the cliaradters on the medals and
" signets of various diilrit6s of Asia, the light which
"they reciprocally reilct: upon each other, and the

general analogy which they all bear to the fame

" grand prototype, afford another ample field for cu-
*' riofity. The coins of Aflnm, Napaul, Cafhmeere,
" and many other kingdoms, are all stamped with
" Sanlkreet charaders, and mostly contain allusions to
" the old Sanfkrcct mythology. The fame conformity
" I have obfcrved on the impreflion of feals from

Bootan and Tlibet. A collateral inference maf

," likcwife

i likewise be deduced from the peculiar arrangement of
" the Sanfkreet alphabet, so very different from that of
" any other quarter of the world. This extraordinary
" mode of combination still exists in the greatest part
( of the East, from the Indus to Pegu, in dialeas now
' apparently unconneted, and in characters com-
( pletely diflimilar; and it is a forcible argument that
' they are all derived from the fame source. Another
:, channel of Speculation presents itself in the names
:( of persons and places, of titles and dignities, which
" are open to general notice, and in which, to the
" farthest limits of Asia, may be found manifest traces
" of the Sanlkreet." Preface to the Grammar of the
Bengal Language, p. 3. After this curious account of
the Sanfkreet tongue, I proceed to enumerate the works
rwhich have been translated from it, besides the two
mentioned in the text.-- . To Mr. Wilkinswe are in-
debted for Heeto-pades or 4Amiicable Itiru$iion, in a fe-
ries of conneted fables, interspersed with moral, pru.
dential, and political maxims. This work is in such
high esteem throughout the EaR, that it has been trauf-
lated into every language spoken there. It did not
escape the notice of the Emperor Akber, attentive to
every thing that could contribute to promote useful
knowledge. He diredted his Vizicr, Abul Fazel, to
put it into a style suited to all capacities, and to illus-
trate the obscure paflages in it, which he accordingly
did, and gave it the title of, 'The Criterion of Wisdom.
At length, these fables made their way into Europe,
and have been circulated there with additions and al-
terations, under the names of lilpay and Efop. Many
of the Stanfkrcet apologues are ingenious and beautiful,
and have been copied or imitated by the fabulifls of

other

other nations. But in some of them the characters of the
animals introduced are very ill sustained; to describe a
tyger as extremely devout, and praEtifing charity, and
other religious duties, p. I6. or an old mouse well
read in the Neetee SaJlras, i. e. Systems of morality
and policy, p. 24.; a cat reading religious books, p. 3),
&c. discovers a want of taste, and an inattention to
propriety. Many of the moral sayings, if confidered
as detached maxims, are founded upon a thorough
knowledge of life and manners, and convey inftrultion
with elegant simplicity. But the attempt of the author
to form his work into a connected series of fables, and
his mode of interweaving with them such a number of
moral reflections in prose and in verse, renders the
itrudure of the whole so artificial that the perusal of
it becomes often unpleasant. Akber was so sensible of
this, that, among other inftru&ions, he advises his
Vizier to abridge the long digressions in that work. By
these striCtures it is far from my intention to detrac inl
the smallest degree from the merit of Mr. Wilkins.
His country is much indebted to him for having opened
a new source of science and taste. The celebrity of
the Hleeto-pades, as well as its intrinsic merit, not-
withstanding the defeas which I have mentioned,
justify his choice of it, as a work worthy of being
made known to Europe in its original form. From
reading this and his other translations, no man will
refute him the praise, to which he modestly confines
his pretensions, " of having drawn a piture which
" we suppose to be a true likeness, although we ate

unacquainted with the original." Pref. p. xiv.-

2. In the firll Number of the New Asiatic Miscellany,
we have a translation of a celebrated composition in the

East, known by the title of the five Gems. It consists
of tlarzas by five poets who attended the court of
Abifnura, King of Bengal. Some of thcfe flanzas are
simple and elegant.-3. An ode translated from Wulli;
in which that extravagance of fi.icy, and tliofe far-
fetched and unnatural conceits, which so often lifguft
Europeans with the poetical compoeitions of the East,
abound too much. The editor has not informed us to
wlofe knowledge of the Sanskreet we are indebted
for there two translations.-4. Some original grants of
land, of very ancient dates, translated by Mr. Wilkins.
It may seem odd, that a charter or legal convcyance of
property fliould be ranked among the literary com-
politions of any people. But so widely do the manners
of rie Hindoos differ from those of Europe, that as ou.
lawyers multiply words and clauses, in order to render
a grant complete, and to guard against every tling
that may invalidate it, the Pundits seem to difpatcl the
legal part of the deed with brevity, but, in a long pre-
amble and conclusion, make an extraordinary display
of their own learning, eloquence, and powers of com-
position, both in prose and verse. The preamble to
one of these deeds is an encomium of the monarch
who gratts the land, in a bold strain of Eaftcrn ex-
aggeration: " When his innumerable army marched,
" the heavens were so filled with the dult of their feet
" that the birds of the air could reit upon it."-" His
" elephants moved like walking mountains, and the

e arth, oppressed by their weight, mouldered into dlu ft."

It concludes witli dcnouncing vengeance .gainft those

h'o fliould venture to infringe this grant: " Riches
" lid tlle life of man arc as transient as drops of water

11"up
t the Ic;,/ of tlle lotus. Learning this trutl!,

1' I 0 nlian!

" O man! do not attempt to deprive another of his
" property." Asiatic Researches, vol. i. p. 123, &c.
The other grant, which appears to be Ltill more ancient,
is not lcfs remarkable. Both were found engraved on
plates of copper. lb. p. 357, &c.-5. The tranfla-
tion of part of the Shafler, published by Colonel Dow,
in the year 1768, ought perhaps to have been firit
mentioned. But as this translation was not made by
him from the Sanfkreet, but taken from the mouth of
a Brahmin, who explained the Shatter in Persian, or
in the vulgar language of Bengal, it will fall more pro-
perly under notice when we come to inquire into the
Rtate of science among the Hindoos, than in this place,
where we are endeavouring to give some idea of their
taste and composition.

As many of my readers may be unacquainted with

the extravagant length of the four eras or periods of
Indian chronology, it may be proper to give an account
of them fronm MIr. IIallled's Preface to the Code of
Gentoo Laws, p. xxxvi.

1. 'THIE, Sklzee I e/g (or age of purity) is said to

have laste(l three million two hundred thousand years;
and they hold that the life of man was extended in that
age to one hIundred thousand years, and that his stature
was tuwenty-one cubits.

3. Tlr Tirjl/h ogue (in which one third of mankind
*;v corrupted) they suppose to have confilted of two

2. nmillion

tnillion four hundred thousand years, and that men
lived to the age of ten thousand years.

3. THE Duwapaar Jogue (in which half of the human

race became depravedj endured one million fix hun-
dred thousand years ; and the life of man was then re-
duced to a thousand years.

4. THE Collee Jogue (in which all mankind are cor-

rupted, or rather lessened, for that is the true meaning
of Collee) is the present aera, which they suppose or-
dained to subsist four hundred thousand years, of which
near five thousand are already past; and the life of man
in that period is limited to one hundred years.

IF we suppose the computation of time in the Indian

chronology to be made by solar or even by lunar years,
nothing can be more extravagant in itself, or more re-
pugnant to our mode of calculating the duration of the
world, founded on sacred and infallible authority.
Some attempts have been made by learned men, parti-
cularly by M. Bailly, in a very ingenious dissertation
on that subjet, to bring the chronology of the Hindoos
to accord somewhat better with that of the Old lTefta-
ment; but, as I could not explain the principles upon
which he founds his conclusions, without entering into
long and intricate discussions foreign from the fubje& of
this l)iffertation, and as I cannot affcnt to some of his
opinions, I fliall reft- satisfied with referring to his
Astron. Indienne, Disc. Prelim. p. Ixxvii. and leave
my readers to judge for themselves. I am happy to
observe that a Memoir on the Chronology of the Hin-
doos will be publilhed in the Second Volume of the

F F 2 Tranf-

Trantfacions of the Society of Bengal, and I hope that
some learned member of that body will be able, from
his acquaintance with the languages and iiifory of the
country, to throw light upon a subjed which its
connection with religion and fcieLce renders extremely
interesting. From one circunltance, howcver, which
merits attention, we m:v conclude, that the informa-
tion which we have hitherto received concerning the
chronology of the H-Iindoos is very incorrect. We have,
as far as I know, only five original accounts of the
diiferent Jogues or aras of the Hindoos. The first is
given by IA. Roger, who received it from the Brahmins
on the Coromandel coall. According to it, the Suttee
jogue is a period of one million seven hundred and
twenty-eight thourand years; the Tirtah Jogue is one
million two hundred and ninety-fix thousand years;
the Dwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and fixty-four
thousand years. The duration of the Collee Jogue he
does not specify. Porte Ouverte, p. i 7). The next
is that of M. Bernicr, who received it from the Brah-
mins of Benares. According to him, the duration of
the Suttee Jogue was two million five hundred thou-
fnrd years; that of the Tirtahl Jogue one million two
hundred thousand years; tlat of the Dwapaar Jogue is
deight hu!dred and fixty-four tloufand years. Con-
cerning the period of thle Collee Jogue, he, likewise,
ij, filcit. Voyages, tom. ii. p. 160. 'iTe third is that
of Colonel Dow, according to which the Suttee Jogue
is a period of fourteen million of years; theTirtah
Jogue one million eighty tlioufand; the Dwapaar
Jogue fevcnty.two tliouftand ; and tile Collee Jogue
thirty-fix thousand years. Ililt. of -lindoft. vol. i.
p. 2. 'lhe fourth account is tlat of M. Le Gentil,

who received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel
coast, and as his information was acquired in the fame
part of India, and ,:rivr,,d from the fame source with
that of M. Roger, it .,:c,. s; !i his in every particular.
MBem. de I'Academ. des SciLnl(s p!ulr 1772, tom. ii.
part i. p. 176. The fifth is the accouilu of Mr. Hallled,
which I have already given. From this discrepancy,
not only of the total numbers, but of many of the
articles in the different accounts, it is manifest that
our information concerning Indian chronology is
hitherto as uncertain as the whole fyltem of it is wild
and fabulous. To me it appears highly probable, that
when we understand more thoroughly the principles
upon whlich the faditious xras or Jogues of the Hin-
doos have been formed, that we may be more able to
reconcile their chronology to the true mode of com-
puting time, founded on the authority of the Old Testa-
ment; and may likewise find reason to conclude, that
the account given by their astronomers of the situation
of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee
Jogue, is not eftablifhled by aFtual observation, but the
result of a rctrofpetive calculation. Whoever under-
takes to invefligate farther the chronology of the Hin-
doos, will derive great afliflance from a Memoir of Mlr.

Tir- Surya Siddhnlta is composed in the Sanflrcect
llnguage, and profellUs to be a divine revelation, (as
Abul Fazel had related, Aycen Akbery, III. p. 8.) coin-
niunicated to mankind, more tlan two millions of

the Ilindoo iTythologifts divide the period during

1' 1i 4 wlhich

which they suppose the world to have existed. But
when this accompaniment of fiction and extravagance
is removed, there is left behind a very rational and
elaborate system of aflronomical calculation. From
this Mlr. Davis has ft lcded what relates to the calcula-
tion of Eclipses, and has illustrated it with great in-
genuity. The manner in which that subject is treated
has so close al aflinity to the methods formerly brought
from India, and of which I have given some account,
as to confirm firongly the opinion that the Surya
Siddhllilta is the iource fronm which all the others are
(derived. hlow far the real date of this work may
be ascertained from the rules and tables which it con-
tains, will be more clearly eflabliflied when a translation
of the whole is published. In the mean time it is
evident, that what is already known with refpct to
these rules and tables, is extremely favourable to the
hypothesis which ascribes a very high antiquity to the
Astronomy of the Brahmins,

'IHE circumflance, perhaps, most worthy of atten-

tion in the Extracts now referred to, is the system of
Trigonometry included in the Astronomical rules of
the Surya Siddhanta. Afi.t. Research. ii. p. 245.
249. It may be fhcwn that this system is founded
on certain Geometrical Theorems, wlicl, though
modern lMathematicians be well acquainted with, were
certainly unknown to Ptolemy and the Greek Gco-
nictricians.

I1 is with pleasure, too, we observe, that Mr. Davis

has in his ponflTion fevcral other ancient books of
HIindoo Altronomy, and that there is reason to

expccl

expedl from him a translation of the whole Sirya
Siddhanta.

IT must be added, that we also learn from the second

volume of the Asiatic Researches, that some vestiges
of Algebr;ical calculation have been clifcovered among
the Brahmins ; prli:.Liarly Rules for thl solution of
certain Arithmeticl questions, with which it should
seem that nothing but Algebra could have furnished
them. Afiat. Research. ii. p. 468. note, 487. 495.

MY friend, Mr. Professor Playfair, has examined

that Extrat from the Sury:i Siddhanta, which gives an
account of the ancient IHindoo system of Trigonometry,
and has discovered the principles on which it is found-
ed. It is with pleasure I announce, that the result of
this examination will be communicated soon to the
Public; and will afford an additional proof of the ex-
traordinary progress which the natives of India had
early made in the most abstruse sciences.
