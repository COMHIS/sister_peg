PREFACE.
IN fulfilling the engagement which I had

come under to the Public with rcfpcc:

to the Hifory of America, it was my inten-
tion not to have published any part of the
work until the whole was completed. The
present slate of the British Colonies has
induced me to alter that resolution. While
they are engaged in civil war with Great
Britain, inquiries and speculations concern-
ing their ancient forms of policy and laws,
which exist no longer, cannot be inter-
efting. The attention and expectation of
mankind are now turned towards their
future condition. In whatever manner
this unhappy contest may terminate, a new
order of things mufi arise in North Ame-
rica, and its affairs will assume another
afpeat. I wait, with the solicitude of a
good citizen, until the ferment Iubfide,
and regular government be re-eflablifced,

VOL. I. a and

and then I fliall return to this part of my
work, in which I had made some progress.
That, together with the history of Portu-
guefe America, and of the settlements made
by the. several nations of Europe in the
VWef India islands, will complete my
plan.

THiE three volumes which I now pub-

lifh, contain an account of the discovery of
the New World, and of the progress of the
Spanish arms and colonies there. This is
not only the molc splendid portion of the
American flory, but so much detached, as,
by itself, to form a perfec whole, remark-
able for the unity of the subjet. As the
principles and maxims of the Spaniards in
planting colonies, which have been adopted
in tome measure by every nation, are
unfolded in this part of my work; it will
serve as a proper introiluLtion to the history
of all tile European cilablifhmerits in Ame-
rica, and convey such information con-
cerning this imnportant arti-le of policy,
as may be deemed no less interefling than
curiou:s.

Itc

IN describing the atchievemehts and

institutions of the Spaniards in the New
World, I have departed, in many instances,
from the accounts of preceding historians,
and have often related facts which seem to
have been unknown to them. It is a duty
I owe the Public to mention the sources
from which I have derived such intelligence
asjuftifies me either in placing tranfaaions
in a new light, or in forming any new opi.
nion with refped to their causes and effects.
This duty I perform with greater fatisfac-
tion, as it will afford an opportunity of
expressing my gratitude to those bene-
faaors who have honoured me with their
countenance and aid in my researches.

As it was from Spain that I had to

expet the most important information,
with regard to this part of my work, I
considered it as a very fortunate circum-
stance for me, when Lord Grantham, to
whom I had the honour of being person-
ally known, and with whole liberality of
sentiment, and disposition to oblige, I was
well acquainted, was appointed ambafrador

a 2 to

to the court of Madrid. Upon applying
to him, I met with such a reception as
satisfied me that his endeavours would be
employed in the most proper manner, in
.order to obtain the gratification of my
wifthes; and I am perfectly sensible, that
what progress I have made in my inquiries
among the Spaniards, ought to be ascribed
chiefly to their knowing how much his
Lordship interested himself in my success.

BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord

Grantham, than the advantages which I
have derived from his attention in engaging
Mr. Waddilove, the chaplain of his em-
bafTy, to take the conduct of my literary
inquiries in Spain, the obligations I lie
under to him would be very great. During
five years, that gentleman. has carried on
rcfearches for my behoof, with such adti-
vity, perseverance, and knowledge of the
iubjcd, to which his attention was turned,
as have filled me with no less aftonifliment
than fatisfafion. He procured for nc the
greater part of the Spanifli books, which
I have consultcd; and as many of them

were

were printed early in the sixteenth century,
and are become extremely rare, the-collet-
ing of these was such an occupation as
alone required much time and assiduity.
To his friendly attention I am indebted
for copies of several valuable manuscripts,
containing saCs and details which I might
have searched for in vain, in works that
have been made public. Encouraged by
the inviting good-will with which Mr.
Waddilove conferred his favours, I tranf-
mitted to him a set of queries, with refped
both to the cultoms and policy of the native
Americans, and the nature of several infti-
tutions in the Spanish settlements, framed
in such a manner, that a Spaniard might
answer them, without disclosing any thing
that was improper to be communicated to
a foreigner. He translated these into
Spanifl, and obtained from various persons
who had residcd in most of the Spanish
colonies, fucli replies as have aflorded me
much infiruction.

NOTWITHSTANDING those peculiar ad-
vantages with which my inquiries were

a 3 carried

carried on in Spain, it is with regret
1 am obliged to add, that their success
must be ascribed to the beneficence of indi-
viduals, not to any communication by
public authority. By a single arrangement
of Philip II. the records of the Spanish
monarchy are deposited in the lrchivo of
Simancas, near Valladolid, at the distance
ps a hundred and twenty miles from the
feat of government, and the supreme courts
ofjuftice. The papers relative to America,
and chiefly to that early period of its
history, towards which my attention was
directed, are so numerous, that they alone,
according to one account, fill the largest
apartment in the Archivo; and, accord-
ing to another, they compose eight hun-
dred and feventy-three large bundles. Con.
fcious of pofleffing, in Ibme degree, the
industry which belongs to an historian,
the prospeCt of filch a treasure excited my
tnoft ardent curiosity. But the profpet
of it is all that I have enjoyed. Spain,
with an excess of caution, has uniformly
thrown a veil over her tranfations in
America. From firangers they are con-

cealed

cealed with peculiar solicitude. Even to
her own fubjeEds the Archivo of Simancas
is not opened without a particular order
from the crown; and after obtaining that,
papers cannot be copied, without paying
fees of office fb exorbitant, that the expence
exceeds what it would be proper to betlow,
when the gratification of literary curiosity
is the only object. It is to be hoped,
that the Spaniards will at last discover this
system of concealment to be no less impo-
litic than illiberal. From what I have
experienced in the course of my inquiries,
I am satisfied, that upon a more minute
scrutiny into their early operations in the
New World, however reprehensible the
acions of individuals may appear, the
conduct of the nation will be placed in a
more favourable light.

IN other parts of Europe very different

fentiments.prevail. Having fcarchcd, with-
out success, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes
to Charles V. written soon after he landed
in the Mexican empire, which has not
hitherto been published; it occurred to me,

a 4 that

that as the emperor was setting out for
Germany at the time when the melfengers
from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter
with which they were entrutfed might
poilibly be prelerved in the Imperial library
of Vienna. I communicated this idea to
Sir Robert Murray Keith, with whom I
have long had the honour to live in friend-
hlip, and I had soon the pleasure to learn,
that upon his application, her Imperial
M\ajesty had been graciously pleated to
ifTue an order, that not only a copy of that
letter (if it were found), but of any other
papers in the library, which could throw
light upon the History of America, should
be transmitted to me. The letter from
Cortes is not in the Imperial library, but
an authentic copy, attested by a notary,
of the letter written by the magistrates of
the colony planted by him at Vera Cruz,
which I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 288,
hlaving been found, it was transcribed, and
sent to me, As this letter is no less
curious, and as little known as that which
was the objet of my inquiries, I have
given some account, in its proper place,

of

of what is most worthy of notice in it.
Together with it, I received a copy of a
letter from Cortes, containing a long ac-
count of his expedition to Honduras, with
refped to which I did not think it necef-
fary to enter into any particular detail;
and likewise those curious Mexican paint-
ings, which I have described, Vol. iii.
p. 299.

MY inquiries at St. Peterfburgh were

carried on with equal facility and success.
In examining into the nearest communi-
cation between our continent and that of
America, it became of consequence to
obtain authentic information concerning
the discoveries of the Ruffians in their
navigation from Kamchatka towards the
coast of America. Accurate relations of
their firfi voyage, in I741, have been
published by Muller and Gmelin. Several
foreign authors have entertained an opi-
nion, that the court of Ruflia fludioufly
conceals the progress which has been made
by more recent navigators, and fulers the
Public to be aimufed with false accounts of

their

their route. Such condut appeared to me
unsuitable to those liberal sentiments, and
that patronage of science, for which the
present sovereign of Rufiia is eminent;
nor could I discern any political reason,
that might render it improper to apply
for information concerning the late attempts
of the Ruffians to open a communication
between Asia and America. My ingenious
countryman, Dr. Rogerfon, firit physician
to the empress, presented my request to
her Imperial Majesty, who not only dif-
claimed any idea of concealment, but in-
ftantly ordered the iournal of Captain
Krenitzin, who conduted the only voy-
age of discovery made by public autho-
rity since the year 1741, to be translated,
and his original chart to be copied for
my use. By consulting them, I have
been enabled to give a more accurate
view of the progress and extent of the
Ruffian discoveries, than has hitherto been
communicated to the Public.

FtRoM other quarters I have received in.
formation of great utility and importance,

M. le

l. le Chevalier de Pinto, the minister

from Portugal to the court of Great Bri-
tain, who commanded for several years
at Matagroffo, a settlement of the Portu-
guefe in the interior part of Brazil, where
the Indians are numerous, and their ori-
ginal manners little altered, by intercourse
with Europeans, was pleased to fend me
very full answers to some queries concern-
ing the charaQer and institutions of the
natives of America, which his polite recep-
tion of an application made to him in my
name, encouraged me to propose. These
satisfied me, that he had contemplated,
with a discerning attention, the curious ob.
jeds which his situation presented to his
view, and I have often followed him as one
of my beft-inftruded guides.

M. SUARD, to whose elegant translation

of the History of the Reign of Charles V.
I owe the favourable reception of that
work on the continent, procured me an.
fwers to the fame queries from M. de Bou-
gainville, who had opportunities of obferv-
ing the Indians both of North and South

America,

America, and from M. Godin le Jeune,
who resided fifteen years among Indians in
Quito, and twenty years in Cayenne.
The latter are more valuable from having
been examined by M. de la Condamine,
who, a few weeks before his death, made
some short additions to them, which may
be confidered as the last effort of that
attention to science which occupied along
life.

MY inquiries were not confined to one

region in America. Governor Hutchinson
took the trouble of recommending the con-
fideration of my queries to Mr. Hawley
and Mr. Brainerd, two protestant mission-
aries, employed among the Indians of the
Five Nations, who favoured me with an-
fwcrs, which discover a considerable know-
ledge of the people whose customs they
describe. From William Smith, Efq. the
ingenious hitiorian of New York, I received
Iome uicful information. When I cntcr
upon the ILfltory of our Colonies in
North America, I shall have occasion to
acknowlcdgce how much I have been in-

3 ]dcbted

debted to many other gentlemen of that
country.

FRoM-the valuable Colletion of Voyages

made by Alexander Dalrymple, Efq. with
whose attention to the History of Naviga-
tion and Discovery the Public is well ac-
quainted, I have received some very rare
books, particularly two large volumes of
Memorials, partly manuscript, and partly
in print, which were prelented to the
court of Spain during the reigns of Phi-
lip III. and Philip IV. From these I have
learned many curious particulars with
refped to the interior slate of the Spa-
nifh colonies, and the various schemes
formed for their improvement. As this
ColleCtion of M\'emorials formerly belonged
to the Colbert Library, I have quotcd
them by that title.

ALL those books and manuscripts I have

consulted with that attention which the
refped due from an Author to thc Public
required ; anld by minute references to
them, I have cln(c;vourcd to authenticate

whatever

whatever I relate. The longer I reflect
on the nature of historical composition,
the more I am convinced that this fcru-
pulous accuracy is necessary. The his-
torian who records the events of his own
time, is credited in proportion to the
opinion which the Public entertains with
refped to his means of information and
his veracity. He who delineates the
tranfaaions of a remote period, has no
title to claim assent, unless he produces
evidence in proof of his aflertions. With-
out this, he may write an amusing tale,
but cannot be laid to have composed an
authentic history. In those sentiments I
have been confirmed by the opinion of
an Author*", whom his industry, erudi-
tion, and difcernm ent, have deservedly
placed in a high rank among the most
eminent historians of the age. Embold-
ened by a hint from him, I have pub-
lifhed a catalogue of the Spanifi books
which I have consulted. This practice
was frequent in the last century, and was
confidered as an evidence of laudable

v Mr. CGilbbol.

indufiry

indufrry in an author; in the present, it
may, perhaps, be deemed the effect of
ostentation; but as many of these books
are unknown in Great Britain, I could
not otherwise have referred to them as
authorities, without encumbering the page
with an insertion of their full titles. To
any person who may choose to follow
me in this path of inquiry, the catalogue
mult be very useful.

MY readers will obfervc, that in men-

tioning fums of money, I have uniformly
followed the Spanish method of computing
by pejos. In America, the peIofiJertc, or
duro~, is the only one known, and that is
always meant when any fum imported
from America is mentioned. The peso
fuerte, as well as other coins, has varied
in its numerary value; hut I have been
advised, without attending to fuicl minute
variations, to confider it as equal to four
shillings and sixpence of our money. It
is to be remembcred, however, tlat in the
fixtcenth century, the cilce&ive value of
a peso, i. t.the quantity of labour which

it

it represented, or of goods which it would
purchase, was five or fix times as much as
at present.

N. B. SINCE this edition was put into

the press, a History of Mexico, in two
volumes in quarto, translated from the
Italian of the Abbe D. Francesco Saverio
Clavigero, has been published. From a
person, who is a native of New Spain, who
has resided forty years in that country, and
who is acquainted with the Mexican lan-
guage, it was natural to expea much
new information. Upon perusing his
work, however, I find that it contains
hardly any addition to the ancient History
of the Mexican empire, as related by
Acofta and H-lerrera, but what is derived
from the improbable narratives and fan-
ciful conjedures of Torquelnada and Bo-
turini. Having copied their splendid de-
scriptions of the high slate of civilization
in the Mexican empire, M. Clavigero, in
the abundance of his zeal for the honour

of

of his native country, charges me with
having mistaken some points, and with
having misrepresented others, in the His-
tory of it. When an author is conscious
of having exerted industry in research and
impartiality in decision, he may, without
presumption, claim what praise is due to
these qualities, and he cannot be insensible
to any accusation that tends to weaken the
force of his claim. A feeling of this kind
has induced me to examine such iri&tures
of M. Clavigero on my History of America
as merited any attention, especially as these
are made by one, who seemed to poisess
the means of obtaining accurate inform-
ation; and to shew that the greater part
of them is destitute of any just foundation.
This I have done in notes upon the pas-
fages in my History, which gave rife tp his
criticisms.

r-r I-I E progress of men in discovering and n o o K

i peopling the various parts of the earth, --

has been extremely flow. Several ages elapsed lolTPa.t
before they removed far from those mild and ser- pled.
tile regions in which they were originally placed
by their Creator. The occasion of their firfl
general dispersion is known; but we are unac-
quaintcd with the course of their migrations, or
the time when they took possession of the dif-
ferent countries which they now inhabit. Nei-
ther history nor tradition furnish such informa.
tion concerning those remote events, as enables
us to trace, with any certainty, the operations
of the human race in the infancy of society.

WE may conclude, however, that all the Fix n mira

rions by
early migrations of mankind were made by land.

voL. I. B land.

B 0 O K land. The ocean, which surrounds the ha-

bitable earth, as well as the various arms
of the sea which separate one region from
another, though dellined to facilitate the corn-
munication between distant countries, seem, at
firfl view, to be formed to check the progress
of man, and to mark the bounds of that por-
tion of the globe to which nature had confined
him. It was long, we may believe, before
men attempted to pass these formidable bar-
riers, and became so skilful and adventrous as
to commit themselves to the mercy of the
winds and waves, or to quit their native shores
in qucft of remote and unknown regions.

First at- NAVIGATION and ship-building are arts so
tempts to- .
wards navi- nice and complicated, that they require the in-
gation. genuity, as well as experience, of many fuc-

ceflive ages to bring them to any degree of
perfecion. From the raft or canoe, which first
served to carry a savage over the river that
obftru&ted him in the chace, to the connlruc-
tion of a veiNel capable of conveying a nume-
rous crew with safety to a diflant coast, the
progress in improvement is immense. Many
efforts would be made, many experiments
would be tried, and much labour as well as
invention would be employed, before mnen
could acconplilh this arduous and important

undertaking.

undettaking. The rude and imperfec state in B o0 K
which navigation is itill found among all na- -
tions which are not considerably civilized, cor-
responds with this account of its progress, and
demonfirates that, in early times, the art was
not so far improved as to enable men to un-
dertake distant voyages, or to attempt remote
discoveries.

As soon, however, as the art of navigation Introduc-

tion of

became known, a new species of correspondence cummercc,
among men took place. It is from this ara,
that we mutt date the commencement of such
an intercourse between nations as deserves the
appellation of commerce. Men are, indeed,
far advanced in improvement before commerce
becomes an object of great importance to them.
They nuft even have made some considerable
progress towards civilization, before they ac-
quire the idea of property, and ascertain it so
perfecly, as to be acquainted with the molt
simple of all contraas, that of exchanging by
barter one rude commodity for another. But
as soon as this important right is eltablilhed,
and every individual feels that he has an ex-
clufive title to poflefs or to alienate whatever
he has acquired by his own labour and dexte-
rity, the xvwnts and ingenuity of his nature

3 2 acquisitions

B O0 K acquisitions and enjoyments, by disposing of

' what is superfluous in his own stores, in order

to procure what is necessary or desirable in
those of other men. Thus a commercial in-
tercourfe begins, and is carried on among the
members of the fame community. By degrees,
they discover that neighbouring tribes possess
what they themselves want, and enjoy comforts
of which they wish to partake. In the fame
mode, and upon the fame principles, that do-
meftic traffic is carried on within the society,
an external commerce is eitablifhed with other
tribes or nations. Their mutual interest and
mutual wants render this intercourse desirable,
and imperceptibly introduce the maxims and
laws which facilitate its progress and render it
secure. But no very extensive commerce can
take place between contiguous provinces, whose
foil and climate being nearly the fame, yield
similar produclions. Remote countries cannot
convey their commodities by land, to those
places, where on account of their rarity they
are desired, and become valuable. It is to na.
vigation that imen are indebted for the power of
tranliporriil- the fiipefluous flock of one part
of the earth, to fullply the wants of another.
The luxuries and blcilings of a particular cli-
lmate are ns( loingr confined to iifcll alone, but

I the

the enjoyment of them is communicated to the E O O K
molt distant regions. __

IN proportion as the knowledge of the ad-

vantages derived from navigation and com-
merce continued to spread, the intercourse
among nations extended. The ambition of
conquest, or the neccflity of procuring new set-
tiements, were no longer the sole motives of
visiting diatant lands. The desire of gain be-
came a new incentive to activity, routed ad-
venturers, and sent them forth upon long voy-
ages, in search of countries, whole products or
wants might increase that circulation, which
nourifies and gives vigour to commerce. Trade
proved a great source of discovery, it opened
unknown seas, it penetrated into new regions,
and contributed more than any other cause, to
bring men acquainted with the situation, the
nature, and commodities of the different parts
of the globe. But even after a regular com-
merce was eflablilhed in the world, after
nations were considerably civilized, and the
sciences and arts wcie cultivated with ardour
and success, navigation continued to be so im-
perfect, that it can hardly be laid to have ad-
vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement
in the ancient world.

B ', AMUNC

B O 0 K AMONG all the nations of antiquity the
I_, -^ ftruAure of their vessels was extremely rude,
mperfe,- and their method of working them very de-
tion of na-
vigation fedive. They were unacquainted with fe-
among the
ancients, veral principles and operations in naviga-

tion, which are now confidered is the firit
elements on which that science is founded.
Though that property of the magnet, by which
it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients,
its more important and amazing virtue of
pointing to the poles had entirely escaped their
observation. Destitute of this faithful guide,
which now conducts the pilot with so much
certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the
darkness of night, or when the heavens are
covered with clouds, the ancients had no other
method of regulating their course than by ob-
serving the fun and flars. Their navigation
was of consequence uncertain and timid. They
durst seldom quit fight of land, but crept along
the coast, exposed to all the dangers, and re-
tarded by all the obliruCtions, unavoidable in
holding such an aukward course. An incre-
dible length of time was requifitc for perform-
ing voyages, which are now finified in a flort
space. Even in the mildest climates, and in
seas the least ternpeftuous, it was only during
the fumrner months that the ancients ventured
put of their harbours. 'he remainder of the

year

year was loft in inaftivity. It would have been B O K
deemed most inconsiderate rashness to have '
braved the fury of the winds and waves during
winter a.

WHILE both the science and praEtice of na-

vigation continued to be so defecive, it was an
undertaking of no finall difficulty and danger
to visit any remote region of. the earth. Under
every disadvantage, however, the active spirit
of commerce exerted itself. The Egyptians, Navigation

soon after the efiablifhment of their monarchy, merceof
are said to have opened a trade between the t 5.Eypti-
Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the western
coast of the great Indian continent. The com-
modities which they imported from the east,
were carried by land from the Arabian Gulph
to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down
that river to the Mediterranean. But if the
Egyptians in early times applied themselves to
commerce, their attention to it was of short
duration. The fertile foil and mild climate of
Egypt produced the ncceflhrics and comforts of
life with such profusion, as rendered its inha-
bitants so iindependcnt of other countries, that
it became an cflabliflled maxim among that
people, whose ideas and institutions difircd in

consequence of this, they never went out of
their own country; they held all sea-faring
persons in detestation, as impious and profane;
and fortifying their own harbours, they denied
strangers admittance into them b. It was in the
decline of their power, and when their vene-
ration for ancient maxims had greatly abated,
that they again opened their ports, and resumed
any communication with foreigners.

ans were as favourable to the spirit of commerce
and discovery as those of the Egyptians were
adverse to it. They had no distinguishing pe-
culiarity in their manners and inflitutions; they
were not addiEted to any singular and unsocial
form of fuperflilion; they could mingle with
other nations without scruple or relucance.
The territory which they pofefTcd was neither
large nor fertile. Commerce was the only
source from which they could derive opulence
or power. Accordingly, the trade carried on
by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was more
cxtcnilve and enterprising than that of any tfate
in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe-

nicians,

nicians, as well as the objeEt of their policy and B o o E
the spirit of their laws, were entirely commer -
cial. They were a people of merchants who
aimed at the empire of the fc., and aEually
poffefTed it. Their ships not only frequented
all the ports in the Mediterranean, but they
were the first who ventured beyond the ancient
boundaries of navigation, and paling the
Streights of Gades, visited the western coasts of
Spain and Africa. In many of the places to
which they resorted, they planted colonies, and
communicated to the rude inhabitants some
knowledge of their arts and improvements.
While they extended their discoveries towards
the north and the well, they did not neglec to
penetrate into the more opulent and fertile re-
gions of the south and east. Having rendered
themfeles masters of several commodious har-
bours towards the bottom of the Arabian
Gulph, they, after the example of the Egypti-
ans, established a regular intercourse with Ara-
bia and the continent of India on the one hand,
and with the eastern coast of Africa on the
other. From these countries they imported
many valuable commodities, unknown to the
reft of the world, and, during a long period,
engrosscd that lucrative branch of commerce
without a rival.

B 0o0 K THE vast wealth which the Phenicians ac-

a-,_-i quired by monopolizing the trade carried on
OfthleJews. in the Red Sea, incited their neighbours the

Jews, under the prosperous reigns of David
and Solomon, to aim at being admitted to
some share of it. This they obtained, partly
by their conquest of Idumea, which stretches
along the Red Sea, and partly by their alli-
ance with Hiram king of Tyre. Solomon
fitted out fleets, which, under the direction of
Phenician pilots, failed from the Red Sea to
Tarshish and Ophir. These it. is probable
were ports in India and Africa which their
conductors were accustomed to frequent, and
from them the Jewish ihips returned with such
valuable cargoes as suddenly diffused wealth
and splendour through the kingdom of Ifraeld.
But the singular institutions of the Jews, the
obfcrvance of which was enjoined by their
divine legislator, with an intention of preferv-
ing them a separate people, uninfetted by ido-
latry, formed a national character incapable of
that open and liberal intercourse with ftrangcrs
which commerce requires. Accordingly, this
unsocial genius of the people, together witl
the difaftlrs which befcl the kingdom of Israel,

prevented the commercial spirit which their B o O K
monarchs laboured to introduce, and to cherish,,
from ipreading among them. The Jews can-
not be numbered among the nations which
contributed to improve navigation, or to ex-
tend discovery.

BUT though the instructions and example of ofi.cC:,r-

the Phenicians were unable to mould the man- t'"
ners and temper of the Jews, in opposition to
the tendency of their laws, they transmitted
the commercial spirit with facility, and in full
vigour, to their own descendants the Cartha-
ginians. The commonwealth of Carthage ap-
plied to trade and to naval affairs, with no less
ardour, ingenuity, and success, than its parent-
slate. Carthage early rivalled, and soon fur-
passed Tyre, in opulence and power, but seems
not to have aimed at obtaining any flare in
the commerce with India. The Phenicians
had engrofied this, and had such a c(lnmand
of the Red Sea as securcd to them the cxclu-
live pofieflion of that lucrative branch of trade.
The commercial adtivity of the Carthaginians
was exerted in another direction. Without
contending lor the trade of the ca:! wili tlhtir
mother-country, they extended their naviga-
tion chiefly towards the xvcfe and north. lol-
lowing the course which the Phenlicians lhad

olpeled,

B or K opened, they passed the Streights of Gades,

I.
i_-c^ and pushing their discoveries far beyond those

of the parent tfate, visited not only all the
coasts of Spain, but those of Gaul, and pene-
trated at lait into Britain. At the fame time
that they acquired knowledge of new countries
in this part of the globe, they gradually car-
ried their researches towards the South. They
made considerable progress, by land, into the
interior provinces of Africa, traded with some
of them, and fubjeted others to their empire.
They failed along the western coast of that
great continent, almost to the tropic of Cancer,
and planted several colonies, in order to civi-
lize the natives, and accustom them to com-
merce. They discovered the Fortunate Islands,
now known by the name of the Canaries, the
utmost boundary of ancient navigation in the
western ocean .

NOR was the progress of the Phenicians anj

Carthaginians in their knowledge of the globe,
owing entirely to the desire of extending their
trade from one country to another. Com-
merce was followed by its usual efTets among
both these people. It awakened curiosity, en.

larged the ideas and desires of men, and incited B o o K
them to bold enterprises. Voyages were un-
dertaken, the ible object of uhich was to dif-
cover new countries, and to explore unknown
seas. Such, during the profpcrous age of the
Carthaginian republic, were the famous navi-
gations of Iianno and Ilimilco. Both their
fleets were equipped by authority of the senate,
and at public expence. Hanno was direted
to steer towards the south, along the coast of
Africa, and he seems to have advanced much
nearer the equinoctial line than any former
navigator f. Hinilico had it in charge to pro-

THESE voyages, if performed in the manner

the greatcft effort of navigation in the ancient
world; and if we attend to the imperfect state
of the art at that time, it is difficult to deter-
mine, whether we should noft admire the
courage and sagacity with which the design
was formed, or the conduct and good fortune
with which it was executed. But unfortunately,
all the original and authentic accounts of the
Phenician and Carthaginian voyages, whether
undertaken by public authority, or in prose-
cution of their private trade, have perilhed.
The information which we receive concerning
them from the Greek and Roman authors, is
not only obscure and inaccurate, but, if we

only a mystery of trade, but a secret of state.
Extraordinary fads are recorded concerning
their solicitude to prevent other nations from

The navigation round Africa, in particular, is
recorded by the Greek and Roman writers,
rather as a f[range ainufing tale, which they
did not comprehend, or did not believe, than
as a real tranfation, which enlarged their
knowledge and influenced their opinions ". As
neither the progress of the Phenician or Car-
thaginian discoveries, nor the extent of their
navigation, were communicated to the reft of
mankind, all memorials of their extraordinary

the former was annihilated by Alexander's con-
quest of Tyre, and the empire of the latter
was overturned by the Roman arms.

tiquaries, history must reft satisfied with relat.
ing the progrcfs of navigation and dilcovery
among the Greeks and Romans, which, though
less splendid, is better ascertained. It is evident
that the Phenicians, who inftruEced the Greeks
in many other useful sciences and arts, did not
communicate to them that extcnfive knowledge
of navigation which they themselves poflieffed;
nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial
spirit and ardour for discovery which diftin-
guifhed their rivals the Carthaginians. Though

which formed many spacious bays and commo.

great number of fcrtile islands, yet, notwith-
itanding ilich a favourable situation, which
seemed to invite that ingenious people to apply
themselves to navigation, it was long before
this art attained any degree of pcrfesion among
them. Their early voyages, the object of
which was piracy rather than commerce, were
so inconfiderablc, that the expedition of the
Argonauts from the coall of T'lef'lly to the
Euxine tea, appeared such an amazing effort
of skill and courage, as entitled the conductorn
of it to be ranked among the demigods, and

exalted the vessel in which they failed to a B 0 0 K
place among the heavenly constellations. Even
at a later period, when the Greeks engaged in
their famous enterprize against Troy, their
knowledge in naval affairs seems not to have
been much improved. According to the ac-
count of Homer, the only poet to whom history
ventures to appeal, and who, by his scrupulous
accuracy in describing the manners and arts of
early ages, merits this diftinAion, the science
of navigation, at that time, had hardly advanced
beyond its rudest state. The Greeks in the he-
roic age seem to have been unacquainted with
the use of iron, the most serviceable of all the
metals, without which no considerable progress
was ever made in the mechanical arts. Theit
veflds were of inconsiderable burthen, and
mostly without decks. They had only one
mafl, which was erected or taken down at
pleasure. They were firangers to the use of
anchors. All their operations in failing were
clumsy and unskilful. They turned their ob-
fcrvation towards liars, which were improper
for regulating their course, and their mode of
obfcrving them was inaccurate and fallacious.
When they had finished a voyage they drew
their paltry barks ashore, as savages do their
canoes, and there remained on dry land until
the fealbn of returning to fca approached. It

VOL.. . C is

B o0 K is not then in the early or heroic ages of

Greece, that we can expect to observe the
science of navigation, and the spirit of disco.
very, making any considerable progress. Dur.
ing that period of disorder and ignorance, a
thousand causes concurred in reitraining cu.
riofity and enterprize within very narrow
bounds.

BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to

a slate of greater civilization and refinement,
Government, in its most liberal and perfet
form, began to be established in their different
communities ; equal laws and regular police
were gradually introduced; the sciences and
arts which are ufefill or ornamental in life were
carried to a high pitch of improvement, and
several of the Grecian commonwealths applied
to commerce with such ardour and success,
that they were confidered, in the ancient world,
as maritime powers of the first rank. Even
then, however, the naval victories of the
Greeks nuft be ascribed rather to the native
spirit of the people, and to that courage which
the enjoyment of liberty inspires, than to any
extraordinary progress in the science of navi-
gation. In the Persian war, those exploit,
which the genius of the Greek hiftoriani
has rendered so famous, were performedl by
fleets, conipolfcd chiefly of finall vessels with-

out

out decks "; the crews of which rufled forward B o o I
with impetuous valour, but little art, to board
those of the enemy. In the war of Pelo-
ponnefus, their ships seem still to have been
of inconsiderable burthen and force. The ex-
tent of their trade, how highly soever it may
have been estimated in ancient times, was in
proportion to this low condition of their ma-
rine. The maritime states of Greece hardly
carried on any commerce beyond the limits
of the Mediterranean sea. Their chief inter-
course was with the colonies of their coun-
trymen, planted in the lesser Asia, in Italy and
Sicily. They sometimes visited the ports of
Egypt, of the southern provinces of Gaul, and
of Thrace, or passing through the Hellerpont,
they traded with the countries situated around
the Euxine sea. Amazing instances occur of
their ignorance, even of those countries, which
lay within the narrow precincts to which their
navigation was confined. When the Greeks
had aflembled their combined fleet against
Xerxes at Egina, they thought it unadvifable
to fail to Samos, because they believcd the
distance between that island and Egina to be
as great as the diflance between Egina and the
Pillars of Hercules . They were either utterly

jecure, or derived from the information of a
few persons, whom curiosity and the love of
science had prompted to travel by land into
the Upper Alia, or by sea into Egypt, the an-
cient feats of uil'onm and arts. After all that
the Greeks learned from them, they appear to
have been ignorant of the moll important sacs,
on which an accurate and scientific knowledge
of the globe is founded.

THE expedition of Alexander the Great into

the east, considerably enlarged the sphere of
navigation and of geographical knowledge
among the Greeks. That extraordinary man,
notwithstanding the violent palfions which in-
cited him, at some times, to the wildest ations,
and the most extravagant enterprises, possessed
talents which fitted him not only to conquer,
but to govern the world. He was capable of
framing thole bold and original schemes of
policy, which gave a new form to human
affalirs. The revolution in commerce, brought
about by thc force of his genius, is hardly in-
ferior to that revolution in empire, occalioned
by the fitcccfs of his arms. It is probable,
tllat the opposition and ell'orts oft the rCI'ublic

of Tyre, which checked him so long in the B o o K
career of his vicories, gave Alexander an op-
portunity of observing the vast relburces of a
maritime power, and conveyed to him tome
idea of the immense wealth which the Tyrians
derived from their commerce, especially that
with the East Indies. As soon as he had ac-
complifhed the dcftruclion of Tyre, and re-
duced Egypt to fubjction, he formed the plan
of rendering the empire which he proposed to
eftablifl, the centre of commerce as well as
the feat of dominion. With this view he
founded a great city, which he honoured with
his own name, near one of the mouths of the
river Nile, that by the Mediterranean sea, and
the neighbourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it
might command the trade both of the east and
weft P. This situation was chosen with such
discernment, that Alexandria loon became the
chief commercial city in the world. Not only
during the subsistence of the Grecian empire
in Egypt and in the east, but amidst all the
fucceflive revolutions in those countries, fiom
the time of the Ptolemies to the discovery of
the navigation by the Cape of Good Hope,
commerce, particularly that of the East Indies,
continued to flow in the channel which the

out for it.

His ambition was not satisfied with having

opened to the Greeks a communication with
India by sea; he aspired to the sovereignty of
those regions which furnished the reft of man-
kind with so many precious commodities, and
conducted his army thither by land. Enter-
prifing, however, as he was, he may be said
rather to have viewed, than to have con-
quered that country. He did not, in his pro-
grefs towards the east, advance beyond the
banks of the rivers that fall into the Indus,
which is now the weltern boundary of the vast
continent of India. Amidf the wild exploits
which diflinguifh this part of his hiflory, he
pursued measures that mark the superiority
of his genius, as well as the extent of his
views. lie had penetrated as far into India
as to confirm his opinion of its commercial
importance, and to perceive that imncnlfe
wealth might be derived from intercourfc witl
a country, where the arts of elegance having
been more early cultivated, were arrived at
greater perfedion than in any other part of
the earth''. Full of this idea, he rclolved to

examine the course of navigation from the B 0 0 K
mouth of the Indus to the bottom of the Per- ,
fian Gulf; and if it should be found prati-
cable, to establish a regular communication
between them. In order to effcc& this, he
proposed to remove the cataracts, with which,
the jealousy of the Persians, and their aversion
to correspondence with foreigners, had ob-
struted the entrance into the Euphrates'; to
carry the commodities of the east up that river,
and the Tigris, which unites with it, into the
interior parts of his Asiatic dominions ; while,
by the way of the Arabian Gulf, and the river
Nile, they might be conveyed to Alexandria,
and distributed to the reft of the world.
Nearchus, an officer of eminent abilities, was
entrutfed with the command of the fleet fitted
out for this expedition. He performed this
voyage, which was deemed an enterprise so
arduous and important, that Alexander reckon-
ed it one of the moif extraordinary events
which diflinguiflled his reign. Inconsiderable
as it may now appear, it was, at that time, an
undertaking of no little merit and difficulty.

amidst the violent convulsions, and frequent
revolutions in the East, occasioned by the con-
tests among the successors of Alexander, the
navigation to India, by the course which Near-
chus had opened, was discontinued. The In-
dian trade carried on at Alexandria, not only
fbfibfted, but was so much extended under the
Grecian monarchs of Egypt, that it proved a
great source of the wealth which distinguishcd
their kingdom.

THE progress which the Romans made in B o o K

navigation and discovery, was still more in- _--,
considerable than that of the Greeks. The OfhlRO-
genius of the Roman people, their military
education, and the spirit of their laws, con-
curred in estranging them from commerce and
naval affairs. It was the neceflity of opposing
a formidable rival, not the desire of extending
trade, which sirs' prompted them to aim at
maritime power. Though they loon perceived
that, in order to acquire the universal domi-
nion after which they aspired, it was necessary
to render themselves maflers of the sea, they
fiill confidered the naval service as a fubordi-
nate fiation, and reserved for it such citizens
as were not of a rank to be admitted into the
legions x. In the history of the Roman re-
public, hardly one event occurs, that marks
attention to navigation any farther than as it
was instrumental towards conquest. When the
Roman valour and discipline had subdued all
the maritime flates known in the ancient
world; when Carthlage, Greece, and Egypt,
had submittcd to their power, the Romans
did not imbibe the commercial spirit of the
conquered nations. Aniolig that people of
soldiers, to have applied to trade would have

been

B o o K been deemed a degradation of a Roman citizen.
--v--' They abandoned the mechanical arts; com-

merce, and navigation, to slaves, to freedmen,
to provincials, and to citizens of the lowest
class. Even after the subversion of liberty,
when the severity and haughtiness of ancient
manners began to abate, commerce did not rife
into high estimation among the Romans. The
trade of Greece, Egypt, and the other con-
quered countries, continued to be carried on in
its usual channels, after they were reduced into
the form of Roman provinces. As Rome was
the capital of the world, and the feat of govern-
ment, all the wealth and valuable productions
of the provinces flowed naturally thither. The
Romans, satisfied with this, seem to have sus-
sered commerce to remain almost entirely in
the hands of the natives of the respective coun-
tries. The extent, however, of the Roman
power, which reached over the greatest part of
the known world, the vigilant infpedion of the
Roman magistrates, and the spirit of the Ro-
man government, no less intelligent than active,
gave such additional security to commerce, as
animated it with new vigour. The union
among nations was never so entire, nor the in-
tercourfe so perfecq, as within the bounds of
this vafi empire. Commerce, under the Ro-
man dominion, was not obflruted by the jea-

louly

lousy of rival states, interrupted by frequent B o O K
hostilities, or limited by partial reitrictions. .
One superintending power moved and regulated
the industry of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits
of their joint efforts.

NAVIGATION felt this influence, and im-

proved under it. As soon as the Romans ac-
quired a taste for the luxuries of the East, the
trade with India through Egypt was pushed
with new vigour, and carried on to greater ex-
tent. By frequenting the Indian continent,
navigators became acquainted with the periodi-
cal course of the winds, which, in the ocean
that separates Africa from India, blow with
little variation during one half of the year from
the east, and during the other half blow with
equal steadiness from the weft. Encouraged
by observing this, the pilots who failed from
Egypt to India abandoned their ancient flow
and dangerous course along the coast, and
as soon as the weflern monsoon set in, took
their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of
the Arabian Gulf, and firetched boldly across
the ocean '. The uniform direction of the
'wind, supplying the place of the compass, and
rendering the guidance of the fiars less ne-
ceflary, conducted them to the port of Mufiris,
on the wefllrn flore of the Indian continent.

B o K There they took on board their cargo, and re-

turning with the eaflern monsoon, finished their
voyage to the Arabian Gulph within the year.
This part of India, now known by the name of
the Malabar coast, seems to have been the ut-
most limit of ancient navigation in that quar-
ter of the globe. What imperfec knowledge
the ancients had of the immense countries which
stretch beyond this towards the east, they re-
ceived from a few adventurers, who had vi-
fited them by land. Such excursions were
neither frequent nor extensive, and it is pro-
bable, that while the Roman intercourse with
India fubfifled, no traveller ever penetrated
farther than to the banks of the Ganges z. The
fleets from Egypt which traded at Mufiris were
loaded, it is true, with the spices and other rich
commodities of the continent and islands of the
farther India; but there were brought to that port,
which became the flaple of the commerce be-
tween the East and Weft, by the Indians thenm
selves, in canoes hollowed out of one tree . The
Egyptian and Roman merchants, satisfied with
acquiring those commodities in this manner, did
not think it neceffTry to explore unknown seas,
and venture upon a dangerous navigation, in qucfi

of

of the countries which produced them. But B o K
though the discoveries of the Romans in In-
dia were so limited, their commerce there was
such as will appear considerable, even to the
present age, in which the Indian trade has been
extended far beyond the practice or conception
of any preceding period. We are informed by
one author of credit b, that the commerce with
India drained the Roman empire every year of
more than four hundred thousand pounds; and
by another, that one hundred and twenty fliips
failed annually from the Arabian Gulf to that
country C.

THE discovery of this new method of failing Difcovrics

of the all-

to India, is the moit considerable improvement ci.ntsby
in navigation made during the continuance of ld
the Roman power. But in ancient times, the
knowledge of remote countries was acquired more
frequently by land than by tea'!; and the Romans,
from their peculiar disinclination to naval affairs,
may be laid to have ncg.le&ced totally the latter,
thoughl a more easy and expediIious method of
dicuovery. The progress, however, of their vic-
torious armies through a considerable portion of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, contributed greatly to

v.__/ the navigation of new and unknown seas. Pre-

vious so the Roman conquests, the civilized na-
tions of antiquity had little communication with
those countries in Europe, which now form its
most opulent and powerful kingdoms. The inte-
rior parts of Spain and Gaul were imperfectly
known. Britain, separated from the reft of the
world, had never been visited, except by its neigh-
bours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian
merchants. The name of Germany had scarcely
been heard of. Into all these countries the
arms of the Romans penetrated. They en-
tirely subdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered
the greatest and molt fertile part of Britain;
they advanced into Germany, as far as the
banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they ac-
quired a considerable knowledge of the pro-
vinces, which firetch along the Mediterranean
sea, from Egypt westward to the firaits of
Gades. In Asia, they not only fubjeced to
their power moll of the provinces which com-
pored the Persian and Macedonian empires,
but, after their victories over Mithridates and
Tigranes, they seem to have made a more ac-
curate survey of the countries contiguous to the
Euxine and Caspian seas, and to have carried
on a more extensive trade than that of the
Greeks wih the opulent and commercial na-
tions, then scatcd round the Euxinle cfa.

2 FJo,,'

FROM this fuccint survey of discovery and B 0 K

navigation, which I have traced from the ear-
lieft dawn of historical knowledge to the full ImperfCeg
establishment of the Roman dominion, the pro- graphia
grefs of both appears to have been wonderfully ainong til
flow. It seems neither adequate to what we might
have expeted from the aaivity and enterprise
of the human mind, nor to what might have
been performed by the power of the great em-
pires which fuccefively governed the world. If
we reje&t accounts that are fabulous and ob-
fcure; if we adhere fleadily to the light and
information of authentic hiflory, without sub-
flituting in its place the conjectures of fancy,
or the dreams of etymologists, we mufi con-
clude, that the knowledge which the ancients
had acquired of the habitable globe was ex-
tremely confined. In Europe, the extensive
provinces in the eastern part of Germany were
little known to them. They were almost to-
tally unacquainted with the vast countries which
are now fubje& to the kings of Dcnmark, Swe-
den, Prussia, Poland, and the Ruflian empire.
The more barren regions, that firetch within
the arEtic circle, were quite unexplored. In
Africa, their rcfearches did not extend far be-
yond the provinces which border on the Medi-
terranean, and those situatcd on the wcftcrn
fliore of the Arabian Gulf In Asia, they were

unac-

B 0 O K unacquainted, as I formerly observed, with all
v--_ the fertile and opulent countries beyond the

Ganges, which furnish the molt valuable com-
modities that, in modern times, have been the
great object of the European commerce with
India; nor do they seem to have ever pene-
trated into those immense regions occupied by the
wandering tribes, which they called by the gene-
ral name of Sarmatians or Scyrhians, and which
are now poflfled by Tartars of various deno.
minations, and by the Asiatic fubjcts of Ruflia.

A remark- s BUT there is one opinion, that universally
tta.l"f prevailed among the ancients, which conveys a

more striking idea of the finall progress they
had made in the knowledge of the habitable
globe, than can be derived from any'detail of
their discoveries. They supposed the earth to
be divided into five regions, which they di-
flinguifhed by the name of zones. Two of
thele, which were nearest the poles, they termed
frigid zones, and believed that the extreme
cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered
them uninhabitable. Another, feated under
the line, and extending on either fide towards
the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and
imagined it to be ol burnt up with unremitting
ceat, as to be equally destitute of inhabitants.
On the two other zones, which occupied the

remainder

remainder of the earth, they bellowed the ap. B o0 K
pellation of temperate, and taught that these, _
being the only regions in which life could sub-
sift, were allotted to man for his habitation.
This wild' opinion was not a conceit of the un-
informed vulgar, or a fanciful fition of the
poets, but a system adopted by the most en-
lightened philosophers, the most accurate hifto-
rians and geographers in Greece and Rome.
According to this theory, a vast portion of the
habitable earth was pronounced to be unfit for
sustaining the human species. Those fertile
and populous regions within the torrid zone,
which are now known not only to yield their
own inhabitants the neceflaries and comforts of
life, with most luxuriant profusion, but to
communicate their superfluous stores to the reft
of the world, were supposed to be the mansion
of perpetual sterility and desolation. As all the
parts of the globe with which the ancients were
acquainted, lay within the northern temperate
zone, their opinion that the other temlperate
zone was filled with inhabitants, was founded
on reasoning and conjeEture, not on discovery.
They even believed that, by the intolerable
heat of the torrid zone, such an insuperable
barrier was placed between the two temperate
regions of the earth, as would prevent for ever
any intercourse between their relpecive inlha-

proves that the ancients were unacquainted with
the true state of the globe, but it tended to
render their ignorance perpetual, by represent-
ing all attempts towards opening a communi-
cation with the remote regions of the earth, as
utterly imprafcicable .

BUT, however imperfect or inaccurate the

geographical knowledge which the Greeks and
Romans had acquired may appear, in refpec:
of the present improved state of that science,
their progress in discovery will seem confider-
able, and the extent to which they carried na-
vigation and commerce muff be reckoned great,
when compared with the ignorance of early
times. As long as the Roman empire retained
such vigour as to preserve its authority over the
conquered nations, and to keep them united,
it was an objecD of public police, as well as of
private curiosity, to examine and describe the
countries which composed this great body.
Even when the other sciences began to decline,
geography, enriched with new oblervations,
and receiving fomcn acceflion from the expe-
rience of every age, and the reports of every
traveller, continued to improve. It attained

were uncivilized, firangers to letters, destitute

subordination, or laws. The manners and in.

be hardly compatible with a tfate of fodal

were little cultivated. The accounts of ancient

misunderstood. The knowledge of remote re-

The citizens of Constantinople did not confine
their trade to the islands of the Archipelago,
or to the adjacent coasts of Asia; they took a
wider range, and following the course which
the ancients had marked out, imported the com-

When Egypt was torn from the Roman empire
by the Arabians, the industry of the Greeks
discovered a new channel, by which the pro-
dutions of India might be conveyed to Con-

as far as that great river is navigable; thence
they were transported by land to the banks of
the river Oxus, and proceeded down its fiream
to the Caspian sea. There they entered the
Volga, and failing up it, were carried by land to
the Tanais, which conducted them into the
Euxine sea, where velfels from Constantinople
waited their arrival'. This extraordinary and

carried on commerce; but because it demon- ._
ftrates, that, during the ignorance which reigned
in the reft of Europe, an extensive knowledge
of remote countries was still preferred in the
capital of the Greek empire.

AT the fame time, a gleam of light and and among

knowledge broke in upon the east. The Ara- abs.
bians having contracted some relifli for the
sciences of the people, whose empire they had
contributed to overturn, translated the books of
several of the Greek philosophers into their own
language. One of the first was that valuable
work of Ptolemy, which I have already men-
tioned. The study of geography became, of
consequence, an early objec of attention to the
Arabians. But that acute and ingenious peo.
ple cultivated chiefly the speculative and fcien-
tific parts of geography. In order to ascertain
the figure and dimensions of the terrestrial globe,
they applied the principles of geometry, they
had recourse to astronomical observations, they
employed experiments and operations, which
Europe, in more enlightened times, has been
proud to adopt and to imitate. At that period,
however, the fanic of the improvements made
by the Arabians did not reach Europe. The
knowledge of their dilcoveries was refcrved for

tile privileges as enabled them to carry on trade B oo K
with great advantage. They were supplied
both with the precious commodities of the earl,
and with many curious manufactures, the pro-
duel of ancient arts and ingenuity which still
subsisted among the Greeks. As the labour and
expence of conveying the productions of India
to Constantinople by that long and indirec
course which I have described, rendered them
extremely rare, and of an exorbitant price, the
industry of the Italians discovered other me-
thods of procuring them in greater abundance,
and at an easier rate. They sometimes pur-
chased them in Aleppo, Tripoli, and other
ports on the coast of Syria, to which they were
brought by a route not unknown to the ancients.
They were conveyed from India by sea, up the
Persian Gulf, and ascending the Euphrates and
Tigris, as far as Bagdat, were carried by land
across the Desert of Palmyra, and from thence
to the towns on the Mediterranean. But from
the length of the journey, and the dangers to
which the caravans were exposed, this proved
always a tedious, and often a precarious mode
of conveyance. At length, the Soldans of
Egypt, having revived the commerce with In-
dia in its ancient channel, by the Arabian Gulf,
the Italian merchants, notwithstanding the vio-
lent antipathy to each other'with which Christ-

ians

B o0 K ians and the followers of Mahomet were then
'"-w-' possessed, repaired to Alexandria, and enduring,

from the love of gain, the insolence and exac-
tions of the Mahometans, eftabliihed a lucrative
trade in that port. From that period, the com-
mercial spirit of Italy became active and enter-
prifing. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose from in-
considerable towns, to be populous and wealthy
cities. Their naval power increased; their
vessels frequented not only all the ports in the
Mediterranean, but venturing sometimes beyond
the Streights, visited the maritime towns of
Spain, France, the Low Countries, and Eng-
land; and, by distributing their commodities
over Europe, began to communicate to its
various nations some taste for the valuable pro-
ductions of the East, as well as some ideas of
manufactures and arts, which were then un-
known beyond the precincts of Italy.

thither. They supplied them with provisions
and military stores. Betide the immense fums
which they received on this account, they ob-
tained commercial privileges and eftabliih-
ments, of great consequence in the settlements
which the Crusaders made in Palestine, and in
other provinces of Asia. From those sources,
prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I
have mentioned. This was accompanied with
a proportional increase of power, and by the
end of the Holy War, Venice, in particular,
became a great maritime slate, poffefting an ex-
tensive commerce, and ample territories'. Italy
was not the only country in which the Crusades
contributed to revive and diffuse such a spirit as
prepared Europe for future difcovcries. By
their expeditions into Asia, the other European
nations became well acquainted with remote
regions, which formerly they knew only by

who took advantage of the slender acquaintance

to fend ambafadors to this illustrious convert,

he fell upon them in another. As monks were

To

B o 'K To those travellers, whom religious zeal sent

1. forth to visit Asia, succeeded others who ven.

tured into remote countries, from the profped
of commercial advantage, or from motives of
mere curiosity. The first and moil eminent of
these was Marco Polo, a Venetian of a noble
ts65- family. Having engaged early in trade, accord.

ing to the custom of his country, his aspiring
mind wished for a sphere of a&tivity more ex-
tensive than was afforded to it by the eltablifhed
traffic carried on in those ports of Europe and
Asia, which the Venetians frequented. This
prompted him to travel into unknown countries,
in expeEtation of opening a commercial; inter.
course with them, more suited to the sanguine
ideas and hopes of a young adventurer.

As his father had already carried some Euro.

pean commodities to the court of the great
Chan of the Tartars, and had disposed of them
to advantage, he resorted thither. Under the
protection of Kublay Chan, the most powerful
of all the fucccfibrs of Zcngis, he continued his
mercantile peregrinations in Asia upwards of
twenty-fix years; and, during that time, ad-
vanced towards the ealt, far beyond the utmost
boundaries to which any Eluropean traveller had
ever proceeded. Inltead of following the course
of Carpini and Rubruquis, along the vast un-

peopled

peopled plains of Tartary, he passed through B OO K
the chief trading cities in the more cultivated -
parts of Asia, and penetrated to Cambalu, or
Peking, the capital of the great kingdom of
Cathay, or China, subjed at that time to the
successors of Zengis. He made more than one
voyage, on the Indian ocean, he traded in many
of the islands, from which Europe had long
received fpiceries and other commodities, which
it held in high estimation, though unacquainted
with the particular countries to which it was
indebted for those precious produdtions; and
he obtained information concerning several
countries, which he did not visit in person,
particularly the island Zipangri, probably the
fame nownow own by the name of Japan q. On his
'return, he aftonifled his contemporaries with
his descriptions of vast regions, whose names
had never been heard of in Europe, and with
such pompous accounts of their fertility, their
populousness, their opulence, the variety of
their manufaitures, and the extent of their
trade, as rose far above the conception of an
uninformed age.

of those early travellers abound with many wild

The wonders which they told, mostly on hear-

the popular traditions and fables of the countries
through which they had passed, were gradually
disregarded as Europe advanced in knowledge.
The latter, however incredible some of them
may have appeared in their own time, have been
confirmed by the ob'crvations of modern tra-
vellers. By means of both, however, the cu-

WHILE this spirit was gradually forming in B o o

Europe, a fortunate discovery was made, which
contributed more than all the efforts and inge- and bythe

invention of

nuity of preceding ages, to improve and to themarinera
extend navigation. That wonderful property of cOma.
the magnet, by which it communicates such
virtue to a needle or slender rod of iron, as to
point towards the poles of the earth, was ob-
served. The use which might be made of this
in direeing navigation was immediately per-
ceived. That valuable, but now familiar inftru-
ment, the mariners compass, was conftruEted.
When, by means of it, navigators found that,
at all seasons, and in every place, they could
discover the north and south with so much ease
and accuracy, it became no longer neceflary to
depend merely on the light of the flars and the
observation of the sea-coast. They gradually
abandoned their ancient timid and lingering
course along the shore, ventured boldly into the
ocean, and relying on this new guide, could
steer in the darkest night, and under the molt
cloudy Iky, with a security and precision hitherto
unknown. The compass may be said to have
opened to man the dominion of the sea, and to
have put him in full poffeflion of the earth, by
enabling him to visit every part of it. Flavio
Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, a town of confider-
able trade in the kingdom of Naples, was the

been often the fate of those illuffrious benefactors
of mankind, who have enriched science and
improved the arts by their inventions, to derive
more reputation than benefit from the happy
efforts of their genius. But the lot of Gioia
has been still more cruel; through the inatten.
tion or ignorance of contemporary historians,
he has been defrauded even of the fame to which
he had such a just title. We receive from them
no information with refpeEt to his profeflion,
his charater, the precise time when he made
this important discovery, or the accidents and
inquiries which led to it. The knowledge of
this event, though produEtive of greater effeds
than any recorded in the annals of the human
race, is transmitted to us without any of thole
circumnflances, which can gratify the curiosity
that it naturally awakens". But though the
use of the compass might enable the Italians to
perform the short voyages to which they were
accufliomcd, with greater security and expedi-
tioll, its influence was not so sudden or exten-
five, as immediately to render navigation adven.
turous, and to excite a spirit of discovery.

ficial invention from producing its full effect Bo o
instantaneously. Men relinquish ancient habits _-
slowly, and with reluctance. They are averse
to new experiments, and venture upon them
with timidity. The commercial jealousy of the
Italians, it is probable, laboured to conceal the
happy discovery of their countryman from other
nations. The art of fleering by the compass
with such skill and accuracy as to inspire a full
confidence in its direction, was acquired gra-
dually. Sailors, unaccustomed to quit fight of
land, durfi not launch out at once and commit
themselves to unknown seas. Accordingly, near
half a century elapsed from the time of Gioia's
discovery, before navigators ventured into any
seas which they had not been accustomed to
frequent.

Clement VI. in virtue of the right claimed by
the holy fee, to dispose of all countries possessed
by infidels, ereEted those isles into a kingdom,
in the year one thousand three hundred and
forty-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la
Cerda, descended from the royal family of
Castile. But that unfortunate prince, deftitutc
of power to assert his nominal title, having never
visited the Canaries, John de Bethencourt, a
Norman baron, obtained a grant of them from
Henry III. of Castiles. Bethencourt, with the
valour and good fortune which distinguished the
adventurers of his country, attempted and
effeEted the conquest, and the possession of the
Canaries remained for some time in his family, as
a fief held of the crown of Castile. Previous to
this expedition of Bethencourt, his countrymen
fettled in Normandy are said to have visited the
coast of Africa, and to have proceeded far to the
365. south of the Canary islands. But their voyages

thither seem not to have been undertaken in confe.
quence of anypublic or regular plan for extending
navigation and attempting new discoveries. They
were either excursions fuggefled by that roving

from their anceflors, or the commercial enter-

prises of private merchants, which attrated so B o o K
little notice, that hardly any memorial of them ,_,
is to be found in contemporary authors. In a
general survey of the progress of discovery, it is
sufficient to have mentioned this event; and
leaving it among those of dubious exiftencc,
or of small importance, we may conclude, that
though much additional information concerning
the remote regions of the East had been received
by travellers who visited them by land, naviga-
tion, at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
had not advanced beyond the state to which it
had attained before the downfal of the Roman
empire.

AT length the period arrived, when Provi- Firitregu.

dence decreed that men were to pass the limits SIlCovy,
within which they had been so long confined,
and open to themselves a more ample field wherein
to display their talents, their enterprise, and
courage. The first considerable efforts towards
this were not made by any of the more powerful
flates of Europe, or by those who had applied to
navigation with the greatest afliduity and fiiccefs.
The glory of leading the way in this new career
was reserved for Portugal, one of the fnlalleft forrmdfhy

and leafs powerful of the European kingdoms. gRlcl.

tion, but routed such a spirit of curiosity and
enterprise, as led to the discovery of the New
World, of which I propose to write the history,
it is necessary to take a full view of the rife, the
progress, and success of their various naval ope-
rations- It was in this school that the discoverer
of America was trained; and unless we trace
the tfeps by which his inftrutors and guides
advanced, it will be impossible to comprehend
the circumstances which suggested the idea, or
facilitated the execution of his great design.

circum- VARIOUS circumstances prompted the Portu-
hich led guefe to exert their activity in this new direc-
to tis. tion, and enabled them to accomplish under.

takings apparently superior to the natural force
of their monarchy. The kings of Portugal,
having driven the Moors out of their dominions,
had acquired power, as well as glory, by the
success of their arms againif the infidels. By
their victories over them, they had extended
the royal authority beyond the narrow limits
within which it was originally circumscribed
in Portugal, as well as in other feudal king-
doms. They had the command of the na-
tional force, could rouse it to a&t with united
vigour, and, after the expulsion of the Moors,

could

could employ it without dread of interrup- B o o K
tion from any domestic enemy. By the per-
petual hostilities carried on for several centuries
against the Mahometans, the martial and adven-
turous spirit which diftinguilhed all the Euro-
pean nations during the middle ages, was im-
proved and heightened among the Portuguese.
A fierce civil war towards the close of the four-
teenth century, occasioned by a disputed fuc-
cession, augmented the military ardour of the
nation, and formed or called forth men of such
acive and daring genius, as are fit for bold
undertakings. The situation of the kingdom,
bounded on every fide by the dominions of a
more powerful neighbour, did not afford free
scope to the activity of the Portuguese by land,
as the strength of their monarchy was no match
for that of Castile. But Portugal was a mari-
time state, in which there were many commo-
dious harbours; the people had begun to make
some progress in the knowledge and practice of
navigation; and the sea was open to them,
presenting the only field of enterprise in which
they could distinguish themnelves.

SUCH was the state of Portugal, and such the rirt ar-

disposition of the people, when John I. surnamed i
the Bastard, obtained lecure po'ifeflion of the
crown by the peace concluded with Caltile, in

the

B 0 0 K the year one thousand four hundred and eleven.

He was a prince of great merit, who, by fupe-
rior courage and abilities, had opened his way
to a throne, which of right did not belong to
him. He instantly perceived that it would be
impofible to preserve public order, or domestic
tranquillity, without finding some employment
for the restless spirit of his fubjecas. With this
view he assembled a numerous fleet at Lisbon,
conpofed of 'all the fiips which he could fit out
in his own kingdom, and of many hired from
foreigners. This great armament was deflined
to attack the Moors fettled on the coast of Bar-
bary. While it was equipping, a few vessels
were appointed to fail along the western shore
of Africa bounded by the Atlantic ocean, and
to discover the unknown countries situated
there. From this inconsiderable attempt, we
may date the commencement of that spirit of
discovery, which opened the barriers that had
so long fiut out mankind from the knowledge
of one half of the terrestrial globe.

AT the time when John sent forth these fliips

on this new voyage, the art of navigation was
flill very impcrfccq. Though Africa lay so nc;ir
to Portugal, and the fertility of the countries
already known on that continent invited men to
explore it more fully, t'e Portugucfc had never

V\elnt rll'cd'

ventured to fail beyond Cape Non. That pro- B 0 0 K
montory, as its name imports, was hitherto con-
fidered as a boundary which could not be passed.
But the nations of Europe had now acquired as
much knowledge, as emboldened them to dif-
regard the prejudices and to corre& the errors
of their ancetfors. The long reign of ignorance,
the constant enemy of every curious inquiry,
and of every new undertaking, was approaching
to its period. The light of science began to
dawn. The works of the ancient Greeks and
Romans began to be read with admiration and
profit. The sciences cultivated by the Arabians
were introduced into Europe by the Moors
fettled in Spain and Portugal, and by the Jews,
who were very numerous in both these king-
doms. Geometry, astronomy, and geography,
the sciences on which the art of navigation is
founded, became objecs of studious attention.
The memory of the discoveries made by the an-
cients was revived, and the progress of their na-
vigation and commerce began to be traced.
Some of the causes which have obflruEed the
cultivation of science in Portugal, during this
century and the last, did not exifl, or did not

it proved successful. The vessels sent on the

beyond it, to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs,
which firetched a confidefable way into the At-

commanders durst not attempt to fail round it,
but returned to Lisbon, more satisfied with

ghre. iU- to arie in Portugal. The fortunate issue of the
verich. king's expedition against the Moors of Barbary,

1417. added Itrength to that spirit in the nation, and

puflied it on to new undertakings. In order to
render ihefe ficcefsful, it was neceflary that they
flould be conducted by a person who poirefled
abilities capable of discerning what was attain-
able, who enjoyed leisure to form a regular

fylteml

system for prosecuting discovery, and who was B 0 0o
animated with ardour that would persevere in -
spite of obstacles and repulses. Happily for
Portugal, she found all those qualities in Henry
Duke of Viseo, the fourth son of king John by
Philippa of Lancaster, sifter of Henry IV. king
of England. That prince, in his early youth,
having accompanied his father in his expedition
to Barbary, dlftinguifhed himself by many deeds
of valour. To the martial spirit, which was the
charactcriftic of every man of noble birth at that
time, he added all the accompliilments of a
more enlightened and polished age. He culti-
vated the arts and sciences, which were then
unknown and despised by persons of his rank.
He applied with peculiar fondness to the study
of geography; and by the inftrution of able
makters, as well as by the accounts of travellers,
he early acquired such knowledge of the habit-
able globe, as discovered the great probability of
finding new and opulent countries, by failing
along the coast of Africa. Such an objec was
formed to awaken the enthufiafrn and ardour of
a youthful mind, and he espoused with the ut-
most zeal the patronage of a design which
might prove as beneficial, as it appeared to be
splendid and honourable. In order that he
might pursue this great Icheme without inter-
ruption, he retired from court immediately after

his

B 0 K his return from Africa, and fixed his residence

at Sagres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the pro.
fpe& of the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts
continually towards his favourite projeEt, and
encouraged him to execute it. In this retreat
he was attended by some of the most learned
men in his country, who aided him in his re-
searches. He applied for information to the
Moors of Barbary, who were accustomed to
travel by land into the interior provinces of
Africa, in quest of ivory, gold-duft, and other
rich commodities. He consulted the Jews fettled
in Portugal. By promises, rewards, and marks
of refpedt, he allured into his service several
persons, foreigners as well as Portuguese, who
were eminent for their skill in navigation. In
taking those preparatory steps, the great abilities
of the prince were seconded by his private virtues.
His integrity, his affability, his refpet for reli-
gion, his zeal for the honour of his country,
engaged persons of all ranks to applaud his
design, and to favour the execution of it. Ilis
schemes were allowed, by the greater part of
his countrymen, to proceed neither from ambi.
tion nor the desire of wealth, but to flow from
the warm benevolence of a heart eager to pro-
mote the happiness of mankind, and which
justly entitled him to assume a motto for his
device, that described the quality by which

inent of any new undertaking, was extremely to;
inconsiderable. He fitted out a single fiip, and
giving the command of it to John Gonzalez
Zarco and Tristan Vaz, two gentlemen of his
household, who voluntarily offered to cpnduca
the enterprise, lie instructed them to use their
utmost efforts to double Cape Bojador, and
thence to steer towards the south. They, ac-
cording to the mode of navigation which still
prevailed, held their course along the fiore;
and by foll'owing that direction, they must have
encountered almost insuperable difficulties in
attempting to pass Cape Bojador. But fortune
came in aid to their want of skill, and prevented
the voyage from being altogether frui:lcfs. A
'Ludden squall of wind arose, drove them out to
sea, and when they expecQed every Inoment to
perifli, landed them on an unknown island,
which from their happy cfcape they named
Porto Santo. In the iniflncy of navigation, the
dilcovery of this small island appeared a mattcr
of such moment, that they inflantly returned to
Portugal with the good tidings, and \ cre re-
ceived by Henry with the applause and honour
clue to fortunlate adventurers. This faint dawn

Bs o K of success filled a mind ardent in the pursuit of

a favourite objeE with such sanguine hopes as
were sufficient incitements to proceed. Next

commanders, to whom he joined Bartholomew
Pereftrello, in order to take possession of the
island which they had discovered. When they
began to fettle in Porto Santo, they observed
towards the south a fixed spot in the horizon like

to conjecure that it might be land, and fleering
towards it, they arrived at a considerable island,
uninhabited and covered with wood, which on
that account they called Madeira u. As it was
Henry's chief objeCt to render his discoveries
useful to his country, he immediately equipped
a fleet to carry a colony of Portuguese to there
1420. islands. By his provident care, they were fur.

nifhed not only with the feeds, plants, and do.
meftic animals common in Europe; but as he
foresaw that the warmth of the climate and ser-
tility of the foil would prove favourable to the
rearing of other productions, he procured flips
of the vine from the island of Cyprus, the rich
wines of which were then in great request, and
plants of the fugar-cano from Sicily, into which

it had been lately introduced. These throve so n o O K
prosperously in this new country, that the benefit ,_
of cultivating them was immediately perceived,
and the sugar and wine of Madeira quickly became
articles of some consequence in the commerce of
Portugal x

As soon as the advantages derived from this

i first settlement to the weft of the European con-

tinent began to be felt, the spirit of discovery
appeared less chimerical, and became more ad-
venturous. By their voyages to Madeira, the
Portuguese were gradually accustomed to a
bolder navigation, and instead of creeping ser-
vilely along the coait, ventured into the open
sea. In consequence of taking this course, Gili- Double

the Portuguese navigation upwards of twenty
years, and which had hitherto been deemed up-
passable. This successful voyage, which the 1433.
ignorance of the age placed on a level with the
molt famous exploits recorded in history, opened
a new sphere to navigation, as it discovered the
vail continent of Africa, still wafled by the
Atlantic ocean, and stretching towards the
south. Part of this was soon explored; the

tvere exaggerated, and man)y other objections
against attempting farther discoveries were pro-
posed by some of the grandees, who, from igno.
rance, from envy, or from that cold timid pru-
dence which rejects whatever has the air of
novelty or enterprise, had hitherto condemned
all Prince Henry's schemes. They represented,
that it was altogether chimerical to expect any
advantage from countries situated in that region
which the wisdom and experience of antiquity
had pronounced to be unfit for the habitation of
men; that their forefathers, satisfied with culti-
vating the territory which Providence had allotted
them, did not wafle the strength of the kingdom
by fruitless projects, in quest of new settlements;
that Portugal was already exhaufled by the
expence of attempts to discover lands which
either did not exifl, or which nature destined to
remain unknown; and was drained of men,
who might have been employed in undertakings
attended with more certain success, and produc-
tive of greater benefit. But neither their appeal
to the authority of the ancients, nor their reason-
ings concerning the interests of Portugal, made
any impreflion upon the determined philosophic
nlid of Prince Henry. The discoveries which

knowledge of the torrid zone. He was no less

were malevolent and ill founded. In those fen.

and unwearied zeal with which he had exerted

unknown countries, the wretched inhabitants
of which were utter firangers to true religion,
wvandering in heathen darkness, or led astray 1b

dued by the force of its arms. He intreated him _
to enjoin all Chriflian powers, under the highet:
penalties, not to molefr Portugal while engaged
in this laudable enterprise, and to prohibit them
from fettling in any of the countries which the
Portuguese should discover. IIe promisecd that,
in all their expeditions, it should be the chief
object of his countrymen to spread the know-
ledge of the Christian religion, to efiablifh the
authority of the holy fee, and to increase the
flock of the universal pastor. As it was by
improving with dexterity every favourable con-
junrture for acquiring new powers, that the
court of Rome had gradually extended its
usurpations, Eugene IV. the Pontiff to whom
this application was made, eagerly fcized the
opportunity which now presented itself. lIe
inflantly perceived, that by complying with
Prince Henry's request, he might cxercife a pre-
rogative no less flattering in its own nature, than
likely to prove beneficial in its conflequcnccs.
A bull was accordingly ifuced, in whlich, after
applauding in the (trongeft terms the palt efibrts
of the Portuguese, and exhorting them to pro-
ceed in that laudable career on which they had
entered, he granted them an exclusive right.

Prince Henry was soon sensible of the advantages
which he derived from this tranlatlion. His
schemes were authorised and fan&ified by the bull

conneEted with zeal for religion, which, in that
age, was a principle of such acivity and vigour,

and wondered; while enterprising adventurers
crowded from every part of Europe, soliciting
Prince Henry to employ them in this honourable
service. Many Venetians and Genoese, in par-
ticular, who were, at that time, superior to all
other nations in the science of naval affairs,
entered aboard the Portuguese ships, and ac-
quired a more perfec and extensive knowledge
of their profession in that new school of naviga-
tion. In emulation of these foreigners, the
Portuguese exerted their own talents. The
nation seconded the designs of the prince.
Private merchants formed companies, with a view 1446
to search for unknown countries. The Cape de
Verd Islands, which lie off the promontory of
that name, were discovered, and soon after the ,4,.
isles called Azores. As the former of there are
above three hundred miles from the African
coast, and the latter nine hundred miles from

so boldly into the open seas, that the Portu-
guefe had, by this time, improved greatly in the

sufficient to turn the curiosity of the European
nations into a new channel, to excite an enter.
prifing spirit, and to point the way to future
discoveries.

The pafion ALPHON9O, who possessed the throne of Por-
for disco-

sions to the crown of Castile, or in carrying on
his expeditions against the Moors in Barbary,

other operations, he could not prosecute the
discoveries in Africa with ardour. Ie com-
mitted the condut of them to Fernando Go-

granted an exclusive right of commerce with 1,

pression of a monopoly, the spirit of discovery
languished. It ceased to be a national objet,
and became the concern of a private man, more
attentive to his own gain, 'than to the glory of
his country. Some progress, however, was
made. The Portuguese ventured at length to 147t.
cross the line, and, to their astonishment, found
that region of the torrid zone, which was sup-
posed to be scorched with intolerable heat, to be
not only habitable, but populous and fertile.

this naturally turned his attention towards them,

these countries extended, the poffefion of them
appeared to be of greater coInfequence. While
the Portuguese proceeded along the coafl of

vigour from the countenance of such a monarch
as John. Declaring himielf the patron of every
attempt towards discovery, he promoted it with
all the ardour of his grand-uncle Prince Henry,

fitted out, which, after discovering the kingdoms
of Benin and Congo, advanced above fifteen

John was not only solicitous to discover, but
attentive to secure the poffeflion of those coun.
tries. He built forts on the coast of Guinea;
he sent out colonies to fettle there; he efta-
blifhed a commercial intercourse with the more
powerful kingdoms; he endeavoured to render
iuch as were feeble or divided tributary to the
crown of Portugal. Some of the petty princes
voluntarily acknowledged themselves his vassals.
Others were compelled to do so by force of
arms. A regular and well-digefted system was
formed with refpecd to this new object of policy,
and by firmly adhering to it, the Portuguese
power and commerce in Africa were eftablified
upon a solid foundation.

BY their conRiant intercourse with the people H'pcs of

discovering
of Africa, the Portuguese gradually acquired .a cwroL,,0

to the East

some knowledge of those parts of that country ,,ies.
which they had not visited. The information
which they received from the natives, added to
what they had observed in their own voyages,
began to open proflpecs more extensive, and to
fuggef; the idea of schemes more important,
than those which had hitherto allured and occu-
pied them. They had detcted the error of the
ancients concerning the nature of the torrid zone.

B O O K They found, as they proceeded southwards, that

.j.. the continent of Africa, instead of extending in

breadth, according to the doEtrine of Ptolemy ,
at that time the oracle and guide of the learned
in the science of geography, appeared kenfibly to
contract itself, and to bend towards the eat.
This induced them to give credit to the accounts
of the ancient Phenician voyages round Africa,
which had long been deemed fabulous, and led
them to conceive hopes that by following the
fame route they might arrive at the East Indies,
and engross that commerce which has been the
source of wealth and power to every nation poi.
sessed of it. The comprehensive genius of Prince
Henry, as we may conjecture from the words of
the pope's bull, had early formed some idea of
this navigation. But though his countrymen,
at that period, were incapable of conceiving the
extent of his views and schemes, all the Portu.
guefe mathematicians and pilots now concurrdl
in representing them as well founded and prac-
ticable. The king entered with warimh into
their sentiments, and began to concert meafurcs
for this arduous and important voyage.

masters of the Arabic language, and sent them
into the east, to search for the residence of this
unknown potentate, and to make him proffers
of friendship. They had in charge likewise to
procure whatever intelligence the nations which
they visited could supply, with refpec: to the
trade of India, and the cour'e of navigation to

the most arduous and important which the Por.
tuguefe had ever projected, was committed to
Bartholomew Diaz, an officer whose sagacity,
experience, and fortitude, rendered him equal to
the undertaking. He firetched boldly towards
the south, and proceeding beyond the utmost
limits to which his countrymen had hitherto
advanced, discovered near a thousand miles of
new country. Neither the danger to which he
was exposed, by a succession of violent tempests
in unknown seas, and by the frequent mutinies
of his crew, nor the calamities of famine which
he fuflered from losing his store-ship, could
deter him from prosecuting his enterprise. In
recomnpence of his labours and perfeverancc, lie
at last descried that lofty promontory which
bounds Africa to the south. But to descry it,
was all that he had in his power to accomplifli.
The violence of the winds, the shattered con.
dition of his fiips, and the turbulent spirit of
his sailors, compelled him to return, after a
voyage of sixteen months, in which he dilco-
vered a far greater extent of country than any
former navigator. Diaz had called the pro-

montory

montory which terminated his voyage Cabo Tor- s o o K
mentofo, or the stormy Cape; but the king, his ,-.I
master, as he now entertained no doubt of
having found the long desired route to India,
gave it a name more inviting, and of better
omen, The Cape of Good Hope '.

THOSE sanguine expectations of success were Aworeccr-

confirmed by the intelligence which John re- tfp'esof
ceived over land, in consequence of his embafiy uccai"
to Abyssinia. Covillam and Payva, in obedience
to their mafler's inftrutions, had repaired to
Grand Cairo. From that city, they travelled
along with a caravan of Egyptian merchants,
and embarking on the Red Sea, arrived at Aden
in Arabia. There they separated; Payva failed
direEtly towards Abyssinia; Covillam embarked
for the East Indics, and having visited Calecut,
Goa, and other cities on the Malabar coalt,
returned to Sofala, on the eafl fide of Africa,
and thence to Grand Cairo, which Payva and
he had fixed upon as their place of rendezvous.
Unfortunately the former was cruelly murdered
in Abyflinia, but Covillam found at Cairo two
Portuguese Jews, whom John, wliofe provident

Jews, Covillam tranfinitted to Portugal a journal
of his travels by sea and land, his remarks upon
the trade of India, together with exa& maps of
the coasts on which he had touched; and from
what he himself had observed, as well as from
the information of ikilful seamen in different
countries, he concluded, that by failing round
Africa, a palage might be found to the East

a degree, although by long experience they were
now become adventurous and lkilful mariners,
that some time was requisite to prepare their

fears of his fubjeats, or made it necessary to .
conceal them. As John thought himself now
upon the eve of accomplishing that great design,
which had been the principal object of his reign,
his earnestness in prosecuting it became so vehe-

bereaved him of sleep through the night. While
he was taking every precaution that his wisdom

fled, he went to sea at the age of fourteen, and
began his career on that element which con.
duEted him to so much glory. His early voy.
ages were to thole ports in the Mediterranean
which his countrymen the Genoese firequented.
This being a sphere too narrow for his ative
1467. mind, he made an excursion to the northern

seas, and visited the coasts of Iceland, to which
the Englifli and other nations had begun to
resort on account of its fishery. As navigation,
in every direEion, was now become enter.
prifing, he proceeded beyond that island, the
Thule of the ancients, and advanced several
degrees within the polar circle. Having satis.
fled his curiosity, by a voyage which tended
more to enlarge his knowledge of naval affairs,
than to improve his fortune, he entered into the
Jcrvice of a famous fea-captain, of his own name
and lfamily. This man commanded a linall
squadron, fitted out at his own expence, and
by cruising sometimes againit the Mahoncetanl,

sometimes against the Venetians, the rivals of B 0 o K
his country in trade, had acquired both wealth
and reputation. With him Columbus conti-
nued for several years, no less diftinguilhed for
his courage, than for his experience as a sailor.
At length, in an obstinate engagement, off the
coast of Portugal, with some Venetian caravals,
returning richly laden from the Low Countries,
the vessel on board which he served took fire,
together with one of the enemy's ships, to
which it was fat grappled. In this dreadful
extremity his intrepidity and presence of mind
did not forsake him. He threw himself into the
sea, laid hold of a floating oar, and by the sup.
port of it, and his dexterity in swimming, he
reached the shore, though above two leagues
distant, and saved a life reserved for great un-
dertakings b

As soon as he recovered strength for the He eletei

ceived such a favourable opinion of his merit,
as well as talents, that they warmly folici;ed him
to remain in that kingdom, where his naval
tkill and experience could not fail of rendering
him conspicuous. To every adventurer, ani-

G 3 mated

o Ki mated either with curiosity to visit new coun,

the Portuguese service was at that time ex.
tremely inviting. Columbus listened with a
favourable ear to the advice of his friends, and
having gained the esteem of a Portuguese lady,
whom he married, fixed his residence in Lisbon.
This alliance, inflead of detaching him from a
sea-faring life, contributed to enlarge the sphere
of his naval knowledge, and to excite a desire
of extending it still farther. His wife was a
daughter of Bartholomew Pereftrello, one of
the captains employed by Prince Henry in his
early navigations, and who, under his protec-
tion, had discovered and planted the islands of
Porto Santo and Madeira. Colunmbus got pof
feffioI of the journals and charts of this expe.
rienced navigator, and from them he learned
the course which the Portuguese had held in
making their discoveries, as well as the various
circumflances which guided or encopraged them
in their attempts. The fludy of these ibothed
and inflamed his favourite paflion; and while
he contemplated the maps, and read the le.
scriptions of the new countries which Perlefrcllo
had seen, his impatience to visit them became
irresistible. In order to indulge it, he mailc a
voyage to Madeira, and continued during fcvc-
ral years to trade with that illand, with the

Canaries,

Canaries, the Azores, the settlements in Guinea, B O O K
and all the other places which the Portuguese _
had discovered on the continent of Africa'.

during such a variety of voyages, to almost covcrles
every part of the globe with which, at that UPO n.
time, any intercourse was carried on by sea,
he was now become one of the moit skilful na-
vigators in Europe. But, not satisfied with that
praise, his ambition aimed at something more.
The successful progress of the Portuguese navi-
gators had awakened a spirit of curiosity and
emulation, which set every man of science upon
examining all the circumstances that led to the
discoveries which they had made, or that as-
forded a profpe& of succeeding in any new and
bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus,
naturally inquisitive, capable of deep reflection,
and turned to speculations of this kind, was so
often employed in revolving the principles upon
which the Portuguese had founded their schemes
of difcovcry, and the mode on which they had
carried them on, that he gradually began to
form an idea of improving upon their plan, and
of accomplishing discoveries which hitherto they
had attempted in vain.

He forms
the idea f period. From the time that the Portuguese
coue to doubled Cape de Verd, this was the point at
Ipdia. which they aimed in all their navigations, and,

in comparison with it, all their discoveries in
Africa appeared inconsiderable. The fertility
and riches of India had been known for many
ages; its spices and other valuable commodities
were in high requeff throughout Europe, and
the vast wealth of the Venetians arising from
their having engrossed this trade, had raised
the envy of all nations. But how intent soever
the Portuguese were upon discovering a new
route to those desirable regions, they searched
for it only by steering towards the south, in
hopes of arriving at India, by turning to the
east, after they had failed round the farther
extremity of Africa. This course was still un.
known, and, even if discovered, was of such
immense length, that a voyage fiom Europe to
India mufi have appeared, at that period, an
undertaking, extremely arduous, and of very
uncertain ifue. More than halfa century had
been employed in advancing from Cape Non to
the equator; a much longer space of time
might elapse before the more extensive naviga.
tion from that to India could be accomplished.
These reflcdions upon the uncertainty, the

3 danger

danger and tediousness of the course which the B O O K
Portuguese were pursuing, naturally led Co-
lumbus to confider whether a shorter and more
dire& passage to the East Indies might not be
found out. After revolving long and seriously
every circumstance suggested by his superior
knowledge in the theory as well as practice of
navigation; after comparing attentively the ob-
servations of modern pilots with the hints' and
conjetures of ancient authors, he at last con-
cluded, that by failing diretly towards the weft,
across the Atlantic ocean, new countries, which
probably formed a part of the great continent of
India, must infallibly be discovered.

PRINCIPLES and arguments of various kinds, The prin,

ciples on
and derived from different sources, induced him wlich his

theory was

to adopt this opinion, feeningly as chimerical as foinldd.
it was new and extraordinary. The spherical
figure of the earth was known, and its magni-
tude ascertained with some degree of accuracy.
From this it was evident, that the continents of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, as far as they were
known at that time, formed but a finall portion
of the tcrraqueous globe. It was suitable to our
ideas concerning the wisdom and beneficence of
the Author of Nature, to believe that the vast
space still unexplored was not covered entirely
by a wate unprofitable ocean, but occupied by

countries

B o O K countries fit for the habitation of man. It ap.

I1.
_-,L j peared likewise extremely probable, that the

continent, on this fide of the globe, was balanced
by a proportional quantity of land in the other
hemisphere. These conclusions concerning the
existence of another continent, drawn from the
figure and struc'ture of the globe, were confirmed
by the observations and conjectures of modern
navigators. A Portuguese pilot, having stretched
farther to the weft than was usual at that time,
took up a piece of timber artificially carved,
floating upon the sea; and as it was driven
towards him by a welterly wind, he concluded
that it came from some unknown land, situated
in that quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law had
found, to the weft of the Madeira isles, a piece
of timber fashioned in the fame manner, and
brought by the fame wind; and had seen like.
wife canes of an enormous size floating upon the
waves, which resembled those described by
Prolemy as productions peculiar to the Eaf
Indies d. After a course of westerly winds, trees,
torn up by the roots, were often driven upon the
coasts of the Azores, and at one time the dead
bodies of two men with singular features, referm
bling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of
Africa, were cast ashore there.

A:;

As the force of this united evidence, arising B o OR

from theoretical principles and pratical obferv- T
ations, led Columbus to expect the discovery of
new countries in the western ocean, other realbns
induced him to believe that these must be con-
nected with the continent of India. Though tle
ancients had hardly ever penetrated into India
farther than the banks of the Ganges, yet some
Greek authors had ventured to describe the
provinces beyond that river. As men are prone,
and at liberty, to magnify what is remote or
unknown, they represented them as regions of
an immense extent. Ctefias affirmed that India
was as large as all the reft of Asia. Oneficritus,
whom Pliny the naturalilt follows ', contended
that it was equal to a third part of the habitable
earth. Nearchus assertcd, that it would take
four months to march in a firaight line from one
extremity of India to the other r. The journal
of Marco Polo, who had proceeded towards the
East far beyond the limits to which any European
had ever advanced, seemed to confirm these
exaggerated accounts of the ancients. By his
magnificent descriptions of the kingdoms of
Calhay and Cipa7ngo, and of many other coun-
tries, the names of which were unknown in
Elurope, India appeared to be a region of valt

2 extent.

B 0 K extent. From these accounts, which, however

.e_,yr defective, were the most accurate that the people

of Europe had received at that period, with
refped to the remote parts of the EaR, Columbus
drew a just conclusion. He contended, that, in
proportion as the continent of India stretched
out towards the Eaf, it mulf, in consequence of
the spherical figure of the earth, approach nearer
to the islands which had lately been discovered
to the weft of Africa; that the diflance from the
one to the other was probably not very confider-
able; and that the most direct, as well as shortest
course to the remote regions of the east, was to
be found by failing due weft . This notion
concerning the vicinity of India to the western
parts of our continent, was countenanced by
some eminent writers among the ancients, the
fanAion of whose authority was necessary, in that
age, to procure a favourable reception to any
tenet. Aristotle thought it probable that the
Columns of Hercules, or Straits of Gibraltar,
were not far removed from the East Indies, and
that there might be a communication by sea
between them h. Seneca, in terms still more
explicit, affirms, that, with a fair wind, one

might fail from Spain to India, in a few days . Bo O K
The famous Atlantic island described by Plato, i-
and supposed by many to be a real country,
beyond which an unknown continent was situ-
ated, is represented by him as lying at no great
distance from Spain. After weighing all these
particulars, Columbus, in whose characer the
modefly and diffidence of true genius was united
with the ardent enthusiasm of a projecor, did
not reft with such absolute assurance either upon
his own arguments, or upon the authority of the
ancients, as not to consult such of his contem-
poraries as were capable of comprehending the
nature of the evidence which he produced in
support of his opinion. As early as the year
one thousand four hundred and feventy-four, he
communicated his ideas concerning the proba-
bility of discovering new countries, by failing
westwards, to Paul, a physician of Florence,
eminent for his knowledge of cofinography,
and who, from the learning as well as candour
which he discovers in his reply, appears to have
been well entitled to the confidence which Co-
lumbus placed in him. He warmly approved of
the plan, suggested fevcral fads in confirmation
of it, and encouraged Columbus to perfcvcre in
an undertaking so laudable, and which must

GULO1. all those reasonings, and observations, and autho-

rities, would have served only as the foundation
of some plausible and fruitless theory, which
might have furnished matter for ingenious dif.
course, or fanciful conjecture. But with his
sanguine and enterprising temper, speculation
led diredly to aEtion. Fully satisfied himself
with refped to the truth of his system, he was
impatient to bring it to the tefl of experiment,
and to set out upon a voyage of discovery. The
first itep towards this was td secure the patronage
of some of the considerable powers in Europe,
capable of undertaking such an enterprise. As
long absence had not extinguished the affetion
which he bore to his native country, he wvifhed
that it ihould reap the fruits of his labours and

i-e pplies invention. With this view, he laid his fchemne
ntol ht before the Senate of Genoa, and making his

country the firif render of his service, offered to
hfil under the banners of the republic, in qucR
of the new regions which he expeced to dif-
cover. But Columbus had rcfided for so many

years

years in foreign parts, that his countrymen were B o o K
unacquainted with his abilities and characer;
and, though a maritime people, were so little
accuflomed to diflant voyages, that they could
form no just idea of the principles on which he
founded his hopes of success. They inconfider-
ately rejeced his proposal, as the dream of a
chimerical projector, and loft for ever the oppor-
tunity of restoring their commonwealth to its
ancient splendour .

HAVING performed what was due to his coun- to the king

try, Columbus was so little discouraged by the oti'orug;
repulse which he had received, that, inifead of
relinquishing his undertaking, he pursued it with
fresh ardour. He made his next overture to
John II. king of Portugal, in whose dominions he
had been long eftablifcd, and whom he confi-
fidered, on that account, as having the second
claim to his service. Here every circumstance
seemed to promise him a more favourable recep-
tion. He applied to a monarch of an entcr-
prifing genius, no incompetent judge in naval
affairs, and proud of patronising every attempt
to discover new countries. His fubjeqSs were

W- ,_ In Portugal, the profeflional skill of Columbus,

as well as his personal good qualities, were tho.
roughly known: and as the former rendered it
probable that his scheme was not altogether vi-
fionary, the latter exempted him from the fu.
picion of any finiller intention in proposing it.
Accordingly, the king listened to him in the
most gracious manner, and referred the confider.
ation of his plan to Diego Ortiz, bishop of
Ceuta, and two Jewifhi physicians, eminent cos.
mographers, whom he was accustomed to consult
in matters of this hind. As in Genoa, igno.
rance had opposed and disappointed Columbus;
in Lisbon, he had to combat with prejudice, an
enemy no less formidable. The persons, accord-
ing to whole decision his scheme was to be
adopted or rejeted, had been the chief diretors
of the Portuguese navigations, and had advilic
to sea ch for a passage to India, by steering a
course directl) opposite to that which Columous
recommended as shorter and more certain.
They could not, therefore, approve of his pro-
pofal, without submitting to the double mortifi-
cation, of condcLnning their own theory, and of

y whom lie acknowledging his superior sagacity. After

tearing him with captious queltions, and flaring
innumerable objections, with a view of betraying
him into such a particular explanation of his

system, as might draw from him a full discovery B 0l K
of its nature, they deferred palling a final judg- -
ment with refpeR to it. In the mean time, they
conspired to rob him of the honour and advan-
tages which he expected from the success of his
scheme, advising the king to dispatch a vessel
secretly, in order to attempt the proposed disco-
very, by following exactly the course which Co-
lumbus seemed to point out. John, forgetting
on this occasion the sentiments becoming a
monarch, meanly adopted this perfidious counsel.
But the pilot chosen to execute Columbus's plan
had neither the genius, nor the fortitude of its
author. Contrary winds arose, no fight of
approaching land appeared, his courage failed,
and he returned to Lisbon, execrating the pro-
ject as equally extravagant and dangerous'".

of his plan, and to carry it into execution, he
resolved to propose it in person to Ferdinand and

applications to kings and ministers, he took the
precaution of fending into England his brother
Bartholomew, to whom he had fully communi.
cated his ideas, in order that he might negociate,
at the fame time, with Henry VII. who was
reputed one of the most sagacious as well as opu.
lent princes in Europe;

Obltacics to IT was not without reason that Columbus
his uIcccfs
in Sain. entertained doubts and fears with refpea to the

reception of his proposals in the Spanish court.
Spain was, at that junrture, engaged in a dan.
gerous war with Grenada, the last of the Moorish
kingdoms in that country. The wary and fu-
picious temper of Ferdinand was not formed to
relilli bold or uncommon designs. lilablla,
though more generous and enterprising, was
under the influence of her husband in all her
actions. The Spaniards had hitherto malde no
elborts to extend navigation beyond its ancient
linits, and had beheld the amazing progrels of
dilcovery among their neighbours the Portu.

rival them. The war with the Infidels afforded B o O K
an ample field to the national a&tivity and love
of glory. Under circumstances so unfavour-
able, it was impossible for Columbus to make
rapid progress with a nation, naturally flow and
dilatory in forming all its resolutions. His cha-
raaer, however, was admirably adapted to that
of the people, whose confidence and protetion
he solicited. He was grave, though courteous
in his deportment; circumfped in his words
and aaions; irreproachable in his morals; and
exemplary in his attention to all the duties and
funtions of religion. By qualities so refpet-
able, he not only gained many private friends,
but acquired such general esteem, that, not-
withstanding the plainness of his appearance,
suitable to the mediocrity of his fortune, he was
not confidered as a mere adventurer, to whom
indigence had fuggelted a visionary project, but
was received as a person to whole propositions
serious attention was due.

FERDINAND and Isabella, though fully occu- iis rLme

c'an'ined

pied by their operations against the Moors, paid by,.in;,l'i
1o much regard to Columbus, as to remit the juldis,
consideration of his plan to the queen's confessor,
Ferdinand de Talavera. Hle consulted such of
his countrymen as were supposed best qualified
to decide with refpet to a subje&t of this kind.

e- 2 But

B 0 K But true science had hitherto made so little pro,
,__-^ grefs in Spain, that the pretended philosophers:

feleaed to judge in a matter of such moment,
did not comprehend the first principles upon
which Columbus founded his conjectures and
hopes. Some of them, from miftakeu notions
concerning the dimensions of the globe, con.
tended that a voyage to those remote parts of
the east, which Columbus expe&ed to discover,
could not be performed in less than three yeas.
Others concluded, that either he would find the
ocean to be of infinite extent, according to the
opinion of some ancient philosophers; or, if he
flould persist in fleering towards the weft beyond
a certain point, that the convex figure of the
globe would prevent his return, and that he mut
inevitably perish, in the vain attempt to open a
communication between the two opposite hemi.
spheres, which nature had for ever disjoined.
Even without deigning to enter into any parti-
cular difcullion, many rejec'ted the fchcme in
general, upon the credit of a maxim, under
-which the ighc:'ant and un:nterprifing flielter
thenlfclves in every age, " That it is prefump.
tuous in any person, to suppose that he alule
poflfec:s I.lowlclge superior to all the reft of
manlind united." They maintained, that if
there were really any lfch countries as C(:
lumbus pretended, they could not have rcI

mai!ieJ

mained so long concealed, nor would the B 0 0 K
wisdom and sagacity of former ages have left ,
the glory of this invention to an obscure Genoese
pilot.

IT required all Columbus's patience and whomade

address to negociate with men capable of ad- ,ou"-l~
vancing such firange propositions. He had to '',,,,Ir"u;
contend not only with the obfinacy of igno-
rance, but with what is still more intraaible,
the pride of false knowledge. After innumer-
able conferences, and wafting five years in
fruitless endeavours to inform and to satisfy
judges so little capable of deciding with propriety,
Talavera, at last, made such an unfavourable
report to Ferdinand and Isabella, as induced
them to acquaint Columbus, that until the war
with the Moors should be brought to a period,
it would be imprudent to engage in any new
and extensive enterprise.

WHArEVER care was taken to soften the

harfinefs of this declaration, Columbus confi-
dered it as a final rejection of his proposals.
But happily for mankind, that superiority of
genius, which is capable of forming great and
uncommon designs, is usually accompanied with
an ardent cnthufiafin, which can neither be
cooled by delays, nor damped by difappl)oiht-

Il 3 111Clt.

B o o K ment. Columbus was of this sanguine temper.
,_ '-_ Though he felt deeply the cruel blow given to

his hopes, and retired immediately from a court,
where he had been amused so long with vain
expectations, his confidence in the jultnefs of
his own fyflem did not diminifl, and his imrpa.
tience to demonfirate the truth of it by an
actual experiment, became greater than ever.
Having courted the protection of fovcreign
states without success, he applied, next, to per.
sons of inferior rank, and addressed successively
the dukes of Medina Sidonia, and Medina Celi,
who, though fubjedts, were possessed of power
and opulence more than equal to the enterprise
which he projected.. His negociations with
them proved as fruitless, as those in which he
had been hitherto engaged; for these noblemen
were either as little convinced by Columbus's
arguments as their superiors, or they were afraid
of alarming the jealousy, and offending the pride
of Ferdinand, by countenancing a scheme which
he had rejected".

Ncgocla- AMID the painful sensations occasioned by

erothri'n such a fucceflion of difappointmcnts, Columbus
ngasnd. had to sustain the additional distress, of having

received no accounts of his brother, whom he

had sent to the court of England. In his voy- B o o K
age to that country, Bartholomew had been so .
unfortunate as to fall into the hands of pirates,
who having stripped him of every thing, de-
tained him a prisoner for several years. At
length he made his escape, and arrived in Lon-
don, but in such extreme indigence, that he was
obliged to employ himself, during a confidera-
ble time, in drawing and felling maps, in order
to pick up as much money as would purchase a
decent dress, in which he might venture to
appear at court. He then laid before the
king the proposals, with which he had been
entrusted by his brother, and, notwithstanding
Henry's excessive caution and parsimony, which
rendered him averse to new or expensive
undertakings, he received Columbus's overtures
with more approbation than any monarch to
whom they had hitherto been presentcd,

with his brother's fate, and having now no pro- poqlct. o:

IIe had already made preparations for this purr
pose, and taken measures for the disposal of his
children during his absence, when Juan Perez,
the guardian of the monaiery of Rabida, near

1l 4 Palos,

B3 0 K Palos, in which they had been educated, ear-
_-L., neftly solicited him to defer his journey for a

short time. Perez was a man of considerable
learning, and of some credit with Queen Isabella,
to whom he was known personally. He was
warmly attached to Columbus, with whose abi.
lities as well as integrity he had many opportbu
nities of being acquainted. Prompted by curio.
fity or by friendship, le entered upon an accu-
rate examination of his iftcem, in conjunrLiiio
with a physician fettled in the nlighbourhood,
who was a considerable proficient in mathnma.
tical knowledge. This invelig'ation satisficd
them so thornlg'il-, with rf)pecl to the solidity
of the principles on which Columbus founded
his opinion, and the probability of success in
executing the plan which he proposed, that
Perez, in order ro prevent his country firom
being dcprived of the glory and benefit lwhich
muil accrue to the patrons of fich a grand
enterprise, ventured to write to Isabella, conjur-
ing her to confider the matter anew, with the
attention which it merited.

MoviED by the rcprefentations of a person

repair immediately to the village of Santa lS,
in which, on accoult of the siege of Granalda,

The first effeEt of their interview was a gracious ,
invitation of Columbus back to court, accoin- ,1v.J
pn.nied with the present of a fiall fum to equip
him for the journey. As there was now a cer-
tain propect, that the war with the Moors
would speedily be brought to an happy ifiue by
the reduction of Granada, which would leave
the nation at liberty to engage in new under-
takings; this, as well as the maik of royal
favour, with which Columbus had been lately
honoured, encouraged his friends to appear
with greater confidence than formerly in sup-
port of his scheme. The chief of these, Alonfo
de Quintanilla, comptroller of the finances in
Castile, and Luis de Santangcl, receiver of the
ecclesiastical revenues in Alagon, xvhofe merito-
rious zeal in promoting this great design entitles
their names to an honourable place in history,
introduced Columbus to many persons of high
rank, and interested them warmly in his be-
half.

BU'T it was not an easy matter to inspire Is atain dif-

Ferdinand with favourable sentiments. 1-Ie fill ,

their aftoniihment, Columbus appeared before
them with the fame confident hopes of fuccef;
as formerly, and insisted upon the fame high
recompence. He proposed that a fmnall fleet
hould be fitted out, under his command, to
attempt the discovery, and demanded to be ap-
pointed hereditary admiral and viceroy of all the
seas and lands which he hould discover, and to
have the tenths of the profits arising from them,
fettled irrevocably upon himself and his de-
fcendants. At the fame time, he offered to
advance the eighth part of the fum neccffary
for accomplifling his design, on condition that
he hould be entitled to a proportional share of
benefit from the adventure. If the enterprise
should totally miscarry, he made no stipulation
for any reward or emolument whatever. In-
stead of viewing this conduct as the clearelt
evidence of his full persuasion with refpe& to
the truth of his own system, or being struck
with that magnanimity which, after so many
delays and repulses, would stoop to nothing
inferior to its original claims, the persons with
whom Columbus treated, began meanly to cal-
culate the expence of the expedition, and the
value of the reward which he demanded. The
expence, moderate as it was, they reprelcnted to

be

be too great for Spain, in the present exhaufled B o o K
state of its finances. They contended that the -
honours and emoluments claimed by Columbus,
were exorbitant, even if he should perform the
utmost of what he had promised; and if all his
sanguine hopes should prove illusive, such vail
conceflions to an adventurer would be deemed
not only inconsiderate, but ridiculous. In this
imposing garb of caution and prudence, their
opinion appeared so plausible, and was so
warmly supported by Ferdinand, that Isabella
declined giving any countenance to Columbus,
and abruptly broke off the ncgociation with
him which she had begun.

THIS was more mortifying to Columbus than

all the disappointments which he had hitherto
met with. The invitation to court from Ifa-
be!la, like an unexpected ray of light, had
opened such profpe&s of success, as encouraged
him to hope that his labours were at an end;
but now darkness and uncertainty returned,
and his mind, firm as it was, could hardly sup-
port the shock of such an unforcfeen reverse.
He withdrew in deep anguish from court, with
an intention of prosecuting his voyage to Eng-
land, as his last reiburce.

B O O K ABOUT that time Granada surrendered, and

v_-- Ferdinand and Isabella, in triumphal pomp,
pro'stuat took poffeflion of a city, the reducion of which

l extirpated a foreign power from the heart of
January Z. their dominions, and rendered them masters of

all the provinces, extending from the bottom of
the Pyrenees to the frontiers of Portugal. As
the flow of spirits which accompanies success
elevates the mind, and renders it enterprising,
Quintanilla and Santangel, the vigilant and dif.
cerning patrons of Columbus, took advantage
of this favourable situation, in order to make
one effort more in behalf of their friend. They
addressed themselves to Isabella, and after ex.
pressing some surprise, that she, who had always
been the munificent patroness of generous un-
dertakings, should hesitate so long to counte-
nance the moit splendid scheme that had ever
been proposed to any monarch; they repre-
sented to her, that Columbus was a man of a
found understanding and virtuous character,
well qualified, by his experience in navigation,
as well as his knowledge of geometry, to form
ju[t ideas with refpce to the ftruaure of the
globe and the situation of its various regions;
that, by offering to risk his own life and fortune
in the execution of his scheme, he gave the
most satisfying cvidence both of his integrity

and

and hope of success; that the fum requisite for B O O K
equipping such an armamrent as he demanded --_
was inconsiderable, and the advantages which '49-
might accrue from his undertaking were im-
mense; that he demanded no recompence for
his invention and labour, but what was to arise
from the countries which he should discover;
that, as it was worthy of her magnanimity to
make this noble attempt to extend the sphere
of human knowledge, and to open an inter-
course with regions hitherto unknown, so it
would afford the highef fatisfaftion to her
piety and zeal, after re-eflablidling the Christian
faith in those provinces of Spain from which it
had been long banishcd, to discover a new
world, to which the might communicate the
light and blessings of divine truth; that if now
she did not decide instantly, the opportunity
would be irretrievably loft; that Columbus was
on his way to foreign countries, where some
prince, more fortunate or adventurous, would
close with his proposals, and Spain would for
ever bewail the fatal timidity which had ex-
cluded her from the glory and advantages that
lhe had once in her power to have enjoyed.

finances, generously offered to pledge her own
jewels, in order to raise as much money as
might be needed in making preparations for the
voyage. Santangel, in a transport of gratitude,
kissed the queen's hand, and in order to save
her from having recourse to such a mortifying
expedient for procuring money, engaged to ad-

the unexpected revolution in his favour, he
returned directly to Santo Fe, though some re-

joy. But the cordial reception which he met
with from Isabella, together with the near pro.
fpea of setting out upon that voyage which had
so long been the object of his thoughts and
wishes, soon effaced the remembrance of all
that he had suffered in Spain, during eight te-
dious years of felicitation and suspense. The

The chief articles of it were, i. Ferdinand and
Isabella, as sovereigns of the ocean, conitituted
Columbus their high admiral in all the seas,
islands, and continents which should be disco-
vered by his indufryr; and flipulated that he
and his heirs for ever fliould enjoy this office,
with the fame powers and prerogatives which
belonged to the high admiral of Castile, within
the limits of his jurifdidtion. 2. They appointed
Columbus their viceroy in all the islands and
continents which he should discover; but if,
for the better adminifilrtion of affairs, it should
hereafter be necessary to establish a separate go-
vernor in any of those countries, they autho-
rifed Columbus to name three persons, of whomn
they would choose one for that office; and the
dignity of viceroy, with all its immunities, was
likewise to be hereditary in the family of Co-
lumbus. 3. They granted to Columbus and
his heirs for ever, the tenth of the free profits
accruing from the productions and commerce
of the countries which he ifould discover.

law-suit fiall arise with refpec to any mercantile
tranfaEiion in the countries which fliould be dif-
covered, it fliould be determined by the sole

return, to an eighth part of the profit P.

TI-IOIGH the name of Ferdinand appears con.

joined with that of Isabella in this tranfation,
his distrust of Columbus was still so violent that
he refused to take any part in the enterprise as
king of Aragon. As the whole expence of the
expedition was to be defrayed by the crown of
Castile, Isabella reserved for her fiibjccbs of that
kingdom an exclusive right to all the benefits
which might redound fiom its success.

nation and conduct of the voyage, they corn- B o o K
mnitted implicitly to the disposal of his prudence. I
But that they might avoid giving any jus[ cause 14,2.
of offence to the king of Poxtugal, they ftrially
enjoined him not to approach near to the Por-
tuguefe settlements on the coast of Guinea, or
in any of the other countries to which the
Portuguese claimed right as discoverers. Ifa-
bella had ordered the ships, of which Columbus
was to take the command, to be fitted out in
the port of Palos, a small maritime town in the
province of Andalusia. As the guardian Juan
Perez, to whom Columbus had already been so
much indebted, resided in the neighbourhood
of this place, he, by the influence of that good
ecclefialtic, as well as by his own connetion
with the inhabitants, not only raised among
them what he wanted of the fum that he was
bound by treaty to advance, but engaged several
of them to accompany him in the voyage.
The chief of these associates were three brothers
of the name of Iinzon, of considerable wealth,
and of great experience in naval affairs, who
were willing to hazard their lives and fortunes
in the expedition.

BUT, after all the eforts of Isabella and Co-

lumbus, the armament was not suitable, either
to the dignity of the nation by which it was

VOL . . e1 quipped,

0 o K equipped, or to the importance of the service

>,_- for which it waas destined. It consisted of three
I'4'5" vessels. The largeit, a ihip of no considerable

burden, was commanded by Columbus, as ad.
miral, who gave it the name of Santa Maria,
out of refpet for the Blessed Virgin, whom he
honoured with singular devotion. Of the fe.
cond, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon was cap.
tain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third,
named the Nigna, was under the command of
Vincent Yanez Pinzon. These two were light
vessels, hardly superior in burden or force to
large boats. This squadron, if it merits thl;t
name, was victualled for twelve months, and
had on board n;nety men, mostly sailors, toge.
ther with a few adventurers who followed the
fortune of Columbus, and some gentlemen of
Isabella's court, whom she appointed to accom-
pany him. Though the expence of the undcer
taking was one of the circumstances which
chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded
so long the negociation with Columbus, the fum
employed in fitting out this squadron did ln,
exceed four thousand pounds.

As the art of fhip-luilding in the fiftccnil

century was cxtrcmely rude, and the bulk of
vcffels was accommodated to the short and c::fi'
voyages along the coast which they were acclf-

tomcl

tomed to perform, it is a proof of the courage C o 0 K
as well as enterprising genius of Columbus, th;t .._'_,
he ventured, with a fleet so unfit for a dirtanit '
navigation, to explore unknown seas, where he
had no chart to guide him, no knowledge of the
tides and currents, and no experience of the
dangers to whiich he might be cxpofed. I-lis
eagerness to accomplish the great design which
had so long engrossed his thoughts, made him
overlook or disregard every circumftancc that
would have intimidated a mind less adventurous.
He pushed forward the preparations with such
ardour, and was seconded so efiectually by the
persons to whom Isabella committed the super.
intendence of this business, that every thinog was
soon in readiness for the voyage. But as Co-
lumbus was deeply impressed with sentiments of
religion, he would not set out upon an expe-
dition so arduous, and of which one great object
was to extend the knowledge of the Christian
faith, without imploring publicly the guidance
and protection of Heaven. With this view, lie,
together with all the persons under his coin-
mand, marched in foleinn proccflion to the
monaltery of Rabida. After confKifling their
fins, and obtaining ab'olution, they received the
holy sacrament from the hands of the guardian,
who joined his prayers to theirs fur the fuccc:s

B o K of an enterprise which he had so zealously pa.

Hisdepar- NEXT morning, being Friday the third day
Spain. of Auguff, in the year one thousand four hun-

dred and ninety-two, Columbus set fail, a little
before sun-rise, in presence of a vast crowd of
fpeEators, who sent up their supplications to
Heaven for the prosperous issue of the voyage,
August 3. which they wished rather than expeCted. Co-

lumbus steered directly for the Canary Islands,
and arrived there without any occurrence that
would have deserved notice on any other occa.
sion. But, in a voyage of such expectation and
importance, every circumltance was the object
of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke
loose, the day after she left the harbour, and
that accident alarmed the crew, no less super-
flitious than unskilful, as a certain omen of the
unfortunate destiny of the expedition. Even in
the short run to the Canaries, the ships were
found to. be so crazy and ill appointed, as to be
very improper for a navigation which was ex-
pcted to be both long and dangerous. Co-
lumbus refitted them, however, to the bce
of his power, and having supplied himfell
with frefl provisions, he took his departure
from Goinera, one of the most westerly of

course due weft, left immediately the usual
track of navigation, and firetched into unfre-
quented and unknown seas. The firif day, as
it was very calm, he made but little way; but
on the second, he loft fight of the Canaries;
and many of the sailors, dejeEed already and
dismayed, when they contemplated the boldness
of the undertaking, began to beat their breasts,
and to ihed tears, as if they 'were never more
to behold land. Columbus comforted them
with assurances of success, and the profpet of
valt wealth, in thbfe opulent regions whither he
was conduEting them. This early discovery of
the spirit of his followers taught Columbus, that
he muff prepare to struggle, not only with the
unavoidable difficulties which might be expected
from the nature of his undertaking, but with
such as were likely to arise from the ignorance
and timidity of the people under his command;
and he perceived that the art of governing the
minds of men would be no leTs requisite for
accomplishing the discoveries which he had in
view, than naval ifill and undaunted courage.
Happily for himself, and for the country by

I 3 which

Bo o K which he was employed, he joined to the ardent

.---.-. temper and inventive genius of a projector,
1492 virtues of another species, which are rarely

united with them. He possessed a thorough
knowledge of mankind, an insinuating addrels,
a patient perseverance in executing any plan,
the perfect government of his own passions,
and the talent of acquiring an ascendant over
those of other men. All these qualities, which
formed him for command, were accompanied
with that superior knowledge of his profeflion,
which begets confidence in times of difficulty

vicilancc and danger. To unflilful Spanish sailors, ac-
Tio, llt'o- customed only to coalting voyages in the ledi.

lu terranean, the maritime science of Columbus,

the fruit of thirty years experience, improved
by an acquaintance with all the inventions of
the Portuguese, appeared immense. As soon as
they put to sea, he regulated every thing by his
folc authority; he superintended the execution
of every order; and allowing himself only a few
hours for sleep, he was at all other times upon
deck. As his course lay through seas which
had not formerly been vilited, the ibundilu-lile,
or iniirumnents for obfcrvation, were continuallh
in his hands. After the example of the Portu-
guefe discoverers, he attended to the motion cl
tides and currents, watched the flight of birt,
the appcaranr'e of fiflllc, of lea-weeds, and of

Cvcr'I

every thing that floated on the waves, and en- o o K

tered every occurrence, with a minute exact- _
ness, in the journal which he kept. As the 49`'
length of the voyage could not fail of alarming
sailors habituated only to short excursions, Co-
lumbus endeavoured to conceal from them the
real progress which they made. With this
view, though they run eighteen leagues on the
second day after they left Gomera, he gave out
that they had advanced only fifteen, and he uni-
formly employed the fame artifice of reckoning
short during the whole voyage. By the four-
teenth of September, the fleet was above two
hundred leagues to the weft of the Canary Isles,
at a greater distance from land than any Spa-
niard had been before that time. There they Apprehen-

rions and
were itruck with an appearance no less aftonith- allrms of

ing than new. They observed that the mag-
netic needle, in their compasses, did not point
exactly to the polar Itar, but varied towaids the
weft ; and as they proceeded, this variation in-
crcafed. This appearance, which is now fami-
liar, though it still remains one of the mysteries
of nature, into the cause of which the sagacity of
man hath not been able to penetrate, filled the
companions of Columbus with terror. They
were now in a boundless and unknown ocean,
far from the usual course of navigation; nature
itself seemed to be altered, and the only guide

which, though it did not satisfy himself, seemed
so plausible to them, that it dispelled their fears,
or silenced their murmurs.

HE' still continued to fleer due weft, nearly

in the fame latitude with the Canary Islands,
In this course he came within the sphere of the
trade wind, which blows invariably from east to
weft, between the tropics and a few degrees be.
yond them. HIe advanced before this steady
'gale with such uniform rapidity, that it was
seldom necessary to shift a fail. When about
four hundred leagues to the weft of the Cana.
ries, he found the sea so covered with weeds,
that it resembled a meadow of vast extent, and
in some places they were so thick, as to retard
the motion of the veffcls. This strange appear-
ance occasioned new alarm and disquiet. The
sailors imagined that they were now arrived at
the utmost boundary of the navigable ocean;
that these floating weeds would obftrud their
farther progress, and concealed dangcrous rocks,
or tome large traEt of land, which had funk,
they knew not how, in that place. Columbus
endeavoured to persuade them, that what had
alarmed, ought rather to have encouragedl them,

and carried them forward. Several birds were I49'
seen hovering about the ship q, and direCted their
flight towards the weft. The desponding crew
resumed some degree of spirit, and began to
entertain fresh hopes.

UPON the first of October they were, accord- Thefc in-

ing to the admiral's reckoning, seven hundred
and seventy leagues to the weft of the Canaries;
but left his men lhould be intimidated by the
prodigious length of the navigation, he gave out
that they had proceeded only five hundred and
eighty-four leagues; and, fortunately for Co-
lumbus, neither his own pilot, nor those of the
other ships, had skill sufficient to correEt this
error, and discover the deceit. Theyhad now been
above three weeks at sea; they had proceeded
far beyond what former navigators had attempted
or deemed pofible; all their prognostics of dif-
covery, drawn from the flight of birds and other
circumstances, had proved fallacious; the appear-
ances of land, with which their own credulity or
the artifice of their commander had from time
to time flattered and amused them, had been
altogether illusive, and their prospect of success

o o ic seemed now to be as diftait as ever. These
_ ,_ refledions occurred often to men, who had no
*491' other objec2 or occupation than to reason and

discourse concerning the intention and circum.
fiances of their expedition. They made impref.
sion, at first, upon the ignorant and timid, and,
extending, by degrees, to such as were better
informed or more resolute, the contagion spread
at length from ship to ship. From secret whif.
pers or murmurings, they proceeded to open
cabals and public complaints. They taxed their
sovereign with inconsiderate credulity, in paying
such regard to the vain promises and rash con-
jectures of an indigent foreigner, as to hazard
the lives of lb many of her own fubjelCs, in pro-
fecuting a chimerical scheme. They asirn:ed
that they had fully performed their duty, by
venturing so far in an unknown and hopclefs
course, and could incur no blamne for refuting to
follow, any longer, a depierate adventurer to
certain deftrudion. They contended, that it
was necessary to think of returning to Spain,
while their crazy veicls were Itill in a condition
to keep the lea, but exprefied their fears that the
attempt would prove vain, as the wind, which
had hitherto been lb favourable to their course,
mnuff render it impolible to lail in the opposite
direcion. All agreed that Columbus flould be
compelled by force to adopt a nlealure on which

and saw that it was now ready to burst out into
open mutiny. lIe retained, however, perfec
presence of mind. He affedcd to seem ignorant
of their machinations. Notwithstanding the

and confident of fuccel:s. Sometimes he em-
ployed all the arts of inlinuation, to lbothe his
nin. Sometimes lhe endeavoured to work upon

tions of the fame and wealth which they were

words of a man whom they had been accustomed

not only restrained them from those violent

with them to accompany their admiral for some
time longer.

As they proceeded, the indications of ap.

proaching land seemed to be more certain, and
excited hope in proportion. The birds began
to appear in flocks, making towards the south.

guefe navigators, who had been guided, in fete.
ral of their discoveries, by the motion of birds,
altered his course from due weft towards that
quarter whither they pointed their flight. But,

diredtion, without any better success than for-
merly, having seen no objet, during thirty
days, but the sea and the icy, the hopes of his
companions fubtided faster than they had risen;

with their expostulations, and required him
instantly to tack about and to return to Europe.
Columbus perceived that it would be of no avail
to have recourse to any of his former arts, which
having been tried so often had loft their effect;
and that it was impossible to rekindle any zeal
for the success of the expedition among men, in
whose breasts fear had extinguished every gene-

to think of employing either gentle or severe
measures, to quell a mutiny so general and so
violent. It was necessary, on all there accounts,
to soothe paflions which he could no longer com-
mand, and to give way to a torrent too impe-
tuous to be checked. He promised solemnly to
his men that he would comply with L.ieir request,
provided they would accompany him, and obey
his commands for three days longer, and if,
during that time, land were not discovered, he
would then abandon the enterprise, and direct

presages of discovering land were now so nume-
rous and prorniling, that he deemed ihcm inhal-
lible. For some days the foundilng line reached
the bottom, and the foil which it brought up
indicated land to be at no great diftaiace. The
flocks of birds increaled, and were comnpofed not
only of sea fw, ut of such land birds as could
not be filppoled to fly far fron the shore. Tihe
crew of the Pinta oblerved a cane foating, which
seemed to have been ncwly cut, and likewise a
piece of timber artificially caived. The lil rs
aboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree
with red berries, perfectly frefl. The clouds
around the setting fun afitmed a new appear-
ance; the air was more mild and warm, aiil,
during night, the wind became unequal and
variable. From all thele 1ymptomns, Columbus
was tb confident of being near land, that on the
evening of the eleventh of Odober, after public
prayers for success, he ordered the fails to be
furled, and the flhips to lie to, keeping flri-i
watch, lefl they fllould be driven aflllore in tlhe
night. During this interval of fuflpenfe andl
cxpedtation, no man slut his eyes, all kept u1o1n

ABOUT two hours before midnight, Columbus Lane dif-

[landing on the forecafle, observed a light at a
distance, and privately po;nted it out to Pedro
Guttierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe.
Guttierez perceived it, and calling to Salcedo,
comptroller of the fleet, all three saw it in
motion, as if it were carried from place to place.
A little after midnight the joyful found of land,
land, was heard from the Pinta, which kept
always a-head of the other ships. But, having
been so often deceived by fallacious appearances,
every man was now become flow of belief, and
waited, in all the anguilh of uncertainty and
impatience, for the return of day. As soon as Friday.
morning dawned, all doubts and fears were dif-
pelled. From every ship an iflaid was seen
about two leagues to the north, whole flat and
verdant fields, well stored with wood, and wa-
tered with many rivulets, presented the afpedt of
a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta
inflantly began the Te Dezalm, as a hymn of
thanksgiving to God, and were joined by those
of the other (hips, with tears of joy and tranf-
ports of congratulation. This cffice of grati.
tude to Heaven was followed by an cat ofjuitice
to their commander. They threw themnfelves at

pronounced the man, whom they had so lately

fpeftacle had drawn together, whose attitudes
and geltures expressed wonder and astonishment
at the strange objeas which presented thernflves
to their view. Columbus was the firfl European
who set foot in the New World which he had
discovered. He landed in a rich dress, and with
a naked sword in his hand. I-s men followed,
and kneeling down, they all kissed' the ground

which

ttvhich they had so long desired to fee. They B 0 0 K
next ere&ed a crucifix; and proftrating them- -
selves before it, returned thanks to God for 1492
condu&ing their voyage to such an happy issue.
They then took solemn possession of the country
for the crown of Castile and Leon, with all the
formalities which the Portuguese were accuf-
tomed to observe in ads of this kind, in their
new discoveries .

THE Spaniards, while thus employed, were Theirmu.
surrounded by many of the natives, who gazed, nihment.
in silent admiration, upon actions which they
could not comprehend, and of which they did
not foresee the consequences. The dress of the
Spaniards, the whiteness of their skins, their
beards, their arms, appeared strange and fur-
prifing. The vast machines in which they had
traversed the ocean, that seemed to move upon
the waters with wings, and uttered a dreadful
found resembling thunder, accompanied ,with
lightning and finoke, fRruck them with such
terror, that they began to rclpbe their new
guefis as a superior order of beings, and con-
cluded that they were children of the Sun, who
had descended to visit the earth.

B o0 K TIE Europeans were hardly less amazed at
_ ,..-. the scene now before them. Every herb, and
1492. shrub, and tree, was different from those which

flourished in Europe. The foil seemed to be
rich, but bore few marks of cultivation. The
climate, even to the Spaniards, felt warm, though
extremely delightful. The inhabitants appeared
in the simple innocence of nature, entirely
naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled,
floated upon their shoulders, or was bound in
tresses around their heads. They had no beards,
and every part of their bodies was perfecly
fnooth.. Their complexion was of a dufl;
copper colour, their features singular, rather
than disagreeable, their afpeet gentle and timid,
Though not tall, they were well shaped, and
activc. Their faces, and several parts of their
body, were fantastically painted with glaring
colours. They were fly at firlt through fear,
but Ibon became familiar with the Spaniards,
and with transports of joy received from theln
hawvksbells, glass beads, or other baubles, in
return for which they gave such provisions as
they had, andl fomni cotton yarn, the only coi-
mnodity of value that they could produce. 1'

Thus, in the first interview between the inhabit- _

was conducEed amicably, and to their mutual
fatisfation. The former, enlightened and am-
bitious, formed already vast ideas with refpet to
the advantages which they might derive from
the regions that began to open to their view.
The latter, simple and undifcerning, had no
foresight of the calamities and desolation which
were approaching their country.

COLUMiUS, who now assumed the title and Columbus

authority of admiral and viceroy, called the island title of ad.

the natives gave to it, and is one of that large
cluster of islands called the Lucaya or Bahama
ifies. It is situated above three thousand miles
to the weft of Gomera, from which the fqua-
dron took its departure, and only four degrees to
the south of it; so little had Columbus deviated
from the westerly course, which he had chosen
as the most proper.

COLUMBUS employed the next day in visiting Proceds

the coasts of the island; and from the universal OtI'1the
poverty of the inhabitants, lie perceived that
this was not the rich country for which he

B o K fought. But, conformably to his theory con.

cerning the discovery of those regions of Asia
'49»- which itretched towards the east, he concluded

that San Salvador was one of the isles which
geographers described as situated in the great
ocean adjacent to India '. Having observed that
loft of the people whom he had seen wore
imall plates of gold, by way of ornament, in
their nostrils, he eagerly inquired where they
got that precious metal. They pointed towards
the south, and made him comprehend by signs,
that gold abounded in countries situated in that
quarter. Thither he immediately determined to
direct his course, in full confidence of finding
there those opulent regions which had been the
object of his voyage, and would be a recom.
pence for all his toils and dangers. He took
along with him seven of the natives of San Sal-
vador, that, by acquiring the Spanish language,
they might serve as guides and interpreters; and
thole innocent people confidered it as a mark of
distinction when they were seleCted to accompany
him.

inhabitants, nearly refeibled those of San Sal-
vador, he made no flay in any of them. He '49: '
inquired everywhere for gold, and the signs
that were uniformly made by way of answer,
confirmed him in the opinion that it was
l brought from the south. He followed that

course, and soon discovered a country which
appeared very extensive, not perfeftly level,
like those which he had already visited; but so
diversified with rising grounds, hills, rivers,
foods, and plains, that he was uncertain whether
it might prove an island, or part of the conti-
nent. The natives of San Salvador, whom he
had on board, called it Cuba; Columbus gave
it the name of Juanna. He entered the mouth
of a large river with his squadron, and all the
inhabitants fled to the mountains as he approached
the shore. But as he resolved to careen his
ihips in that place, he sent some Spaniards,
together with one of the people of San Salvador,
to view the interior part of the country. They,
having advanced above sixty miles from the
ilore, reported, upon their return, that the
loil was richer and more cultivated than any
they had hitherto discovered ; that, besides
many scattered cottages, they had found one
village, containing above a thouland inhabitants;
that the people, though naked, leemed to be

as sacred beings allied to Heaven ; that they had
given them to eat a certain root, the taste oi
which resembled roasted chefnuts, and likewise
a singular species of corn called maize, which,
either when roasted whole or ground into. meal,
was abundantly palatable; that there seemed to
be no four-footed animals in the country, but a
,species of dogs, which could not bark, and a
creature resembling a rabbit, but of a much

continually upon his own theory concerning the
discovery of the Eafl Indies, he was led, by the

of the Great Khan, and imagined that the opu- B o o K
lent kingdom of Cathay, described by Marco -
Polo, was not very remote. This induced him 1492'
to employ tome time in viewing the country.
He visited almort every harbour, from Porto del
Principe, on the north coafr of Cuba, to the
eastern extremity of the island; but, though
delighted with the beauty of the fccnes which
everywhere presented themselves, and amazed
at the luxuriant fertility of the foil, both which,
from their novelty, made a more lively impreC-
sion upon his imagination ", he did not find g;old
in such quantity as was fuflicient to satisfy either
the avarice of his followers, or the expectations
of the court to which he was to return. The
people of the country, as much aftonifi2hc at his
eagerness in quest of gold as the Etropeans
were at their ignorance and simplicity, piuinted
towards the east, where an island which they
called Hayti was situated, in which that metal
was more abundant than among them. Colum-
bus ordered his squadron to bend its courle
thither; but Martin Alonfo Pinzon, impatient
to be the firll whlo flould take pollefion of the
treasures which this country was supposed to
contain, quitted his companions, regardless of

JDi covCrs COLUMBUS, retarded by contrary winds, did
the island

called the port where he first touched St. Nicho.
las, and the island itself Efpagnola, in honour of
the kingdom by which he was employed; and it
is the only country, of those he had yet disco-
vered, which has retained the name that he gave
it. As he could neither meet with the Pinta,
nor have any intercourse with the inhabitants,
who fled in great consternation towards the
woods, he soon quitted St. Nicholas, and fail.
ing along the northern coast of the island, he
entered another harbour, which he called Con-
ception. Here he was more fortunate; his
people overtook a woman who was flying from
them, and after treating her with great gentle-
ness, difinifled her with a prefcnt of such toys
as they knew were most valued in those regions.
The description which flhe gave to her country-
men of the humanity and wonderful qualities of
the firangers; their admiration of the trinkets,
which fle flewed with exultcation; and their
eagerness to participate of the fame favours;
removed all their fears, and induced many ol
them to repair to tlie harbour. The flriagc
objets which they beheld, and the baubles,

which Columbus betlowed upon them, amply B o O K
gratified their curiosity and their wishes. They ..

Cuba. They were naked like them, ignorant,
and simple; and teemed to be equally un-
acquainted with all the arts which appear
most necessary in polithed societies; but they
were gentle, credulous, and timid, to a degree
which rendered it easy to acquire the ascendant
over them, especially as their excessive admi-
ration led them into the fame error with the
people of the other islands, in believing the
Spaniards to be more than mortals, and de-
scended immediately from Heaven. They pof-
sessed gold in greater abundance than their
neighbours, which they readily exchanged for
bells, beads, or pins; and in this unequal traffic
both parties were highly pleated, each confider-
ing themselves as gainers by the tranfacion.
Here Columbus was visited by a prince or ca-
zique of the country. He appeared with all the
pomp known among a simple people, being
carried in a fort of palanquin upon the flnulders
of four men, ant attended by many of his sub-
jeds, who served him with great relpee. IIis
deportment was grave and tlately, very reserved
towards his own people, but with Columbus
and the Spaniards extremely courteous. lIe

COLUMBUS, fill intent on discovering the

mines which yielded gold, continued to interro.
gate all the natives with whom he had any in-
tercourfe concerning their situation. They con-
curred in pointing out'a mountainous country,
which they called Cibao, at some distance from
the sea, and farther towards the east. Struck
with this found, which appeared to him the
fame with Cipango, the name by lwhich Marco
Polo, and other travellers to the east, diftin.
guifhed the island of Japan, he no longer
doubted with refpeEt to the vicinity of the
countries which he had discovered to the remote
parts of Asia; and, in full expectation of reach-
ing soon those regions which had been the ob-
ject of his voyage, lie directed his course towards
the east. He put into a commodious harbour,
which he called St. Thomas, and found that
difrict to be under the government of a power-
ful cazique, named tCla/lrcanhari, who, as he
afterwards learned, was one of the five fovc-
reigns among whom the whole iflanld was di-

invited him to the place of his residence, near
the harbour now called Cape Francois, some

some of his officers to visit this prince, who,

turned, with such favourable accounts both of
the country and of the people, as made Co-

amidst the multiplicity of his occipations, he
had not fliut his eyes for two days, he retired at
midnight in order to take folme repose, having
committed the helm to the pilot, with flridt in-
junelions not to quit it for a moment. The
pilot, dreading no danger, c;arclesly left the
helm to an unexperienced cabini-boy, and the
lhip, carried away by a current, was daflied
againfs a rock. The violence of the shock
awakened Columbus. He ran up to the deck.
There, all was confusion and despair. lIe
alone retained presence of mind. He ordered

some

B O O K some of the sailors to take a boat, and carry out

an anchor astern; but, inflead of obeying, they
'491. made off towards the Nigna, which was about

half a league distant. He then commanded the
marts to be cut down, in order to lighten the
ship; but all his endeavours were too late; the
veflel opened near the keel, and filled so fast
with water that its loss was inevitable. The
smoothness of the sea, and the timely affitance
of boats from the Nigna, enabled the crew to
save their lives. As soon as the islanders heard
of this disaster, they crowded to the shore, with
their prince Guacanahari at their head. Inflead
of taking advantage of the diflrefs in which they
beheld the Spaniards, to attempt any thing to
their detriment, they lamented their misfortune
with tears of sincere condolence. Not satisfied
with this unavailing expreflion of their fympa-
thy, they put to sea a number of canoes, and,
under the direction of the Spaniards, aflifted in
saving whatever could be got out of the wreck;
and by the united labour of so many hands,
almost every thing of value was carried afhorc.
As sant as the goods were landed, Guacanahari
in person took charge of them. By his orders
they were all deposited in one place, and armed
centinels were polted, who kept the multitude
at a diflance, in order to prevent them not only
fromn embezzling, but from infpcdting too cl-

? ,·riousln,

have the merit of carrying the first tidings of
the extraordinary discoveries which had been
made, and to pre-occupy so far the ear of their
sovereign, as to rob him of the glory and re-
ward to which he was justly entitled. There
remained but one vessel, and that the smallest
and most crazy of the squadron, to traverse such
a vast ocean, and carry so many men back to
Europe. Each of those circutimtances was
alarming, and filled the mind of Columbus with
the utmost solicitude. The dcfire of overtaking
Pinzon, and of effacing the unfavourable im-
pressions which his inifreprcfentations might
make in Spain, made it iiecccliry to return
thither without delay. The diCiculty of taking

of Guacanahari; and his unfufpicious simplicity
soon presented to the admiral a favourable op-
portunity of proposing it. Columbus having,
in the belt manner he could, by broken words
and signs, expressed foimc curiosity to know the
cause which lhad moved the islanders to fly with
such precipitation upon the approach of his

flips,

ships, the cazique informed him that the coun- B O O K
try was much infested by the incursions of cer- _- _
tain people, whom he called Carribeans, who 149a.
inhabited several islands to the south-east, These
he described as a fierce and warlike race of men,
who delighted in blood, and devoured the flesh
of the prisoners who were so unhappy as to fall
into their hands; and as the Spaniards, at their
sirss appearance, were supposed to be Carribeans,
whom the natives, however numerous, durst not
face in battle, they had recourse to their usual
method of securing their safety, by flying into
the thickest and inolt impenetrable woods.
Guacanahari, while fpcaking of those dreadful
invaders, discovered such symptoms of terror,
as well as such confcioufiefs of the inability of
his own people to refit them, as led Columbus
to conclude that he would not be alarmed at
the proposition of any scheme which afforded
him the prospect of an additional security against
their attacks. I-Ie instantly offered himl the aflift-
ance of the Spaniards to repel his enemies; he
engaged to take him and his people undler the
prorection of the powc!rful monarch whom lie
Itrved, and offered to leave in the island filch a

ground was marked out for a frmall fort, which
Columbus called Navidad, because he had
landed there on Christmas day. A deep ditch
was drawn around it. The ramparts were forA
tified with pallifades, and the great guns, saved
out of the admiral's flip, were planted upon
them. In ten days the work was finished;
that simple race of men labouring with inconfi.
derate assiduity in ereEting this first monument
of their own servitude. During this time, Co-
lumbus, by his caresses and liberality, laboured
to increase the high opinion which the natives
entertained of the Spaniards. But while he
endeavoured to inspire them with confidence in
their disposition to do good, he wifhled 'likewise
to give them rome striking idea of their power
to punish and destroy such as were the objects
of their indignation. With this view, in pre-
fence of a vafl aflimbly, he drew up his men in
order of battle, and made an ostentatious but
innocent display of the Iharpnefs of the Spanifl
swords, of the force of their spears, and the
operation of their cross-bows. These rude
people, itrangcrs to the use of iron, and unac-
quainted with any liolile weapons, but arrows

of

of reeds pointed with the bones of fishes, wooden B o o K
swords, and javelins hardened in the fire, won-
dered and trembled. Before this surprise or 1492-
fear had time to abate, he ordered the great
guns to be fired. The sudden explosion struck
them with such terror, that they fell flat to the
ground, covering their faces with their hands;
and when they beheld the astonishing effect of
the bullets among the trees, towards which the
cannon had been pointed, they concluded that
it was impossible to resist men, who had the
command of such deltruEive instruments, and
who came armed with thunder and lightning
against their enemies.

AFTER giving such impressions both of the His infiruc-

beneficence and power of the Spaniards, as thlofe he left
might have rendered it easy to preserve an ' ''
ascendant over the minds of the natives, Co-
lumbus -appointed thirty-eight of his people to
remain in the island. He entrusted the com-
mand of these to Diego de Arado; a gentleman
of Cordova, investing him with the fame powers
which he himself had received from Ferdinand
and Isabella; and furnished him with every
thing requisite for the iubfiflence or defence of
this infant colony. He firictly enjoined them
to maintain concord among themselves, to yield
an unreservcd obcdicnce to their commander,

to rcvifit thcm lbon, with such a reinforcement
of flreigtlh as might enable them to take full
poffeflioi of the country, and to reap all the
fruits of their discoveries. In the mean time,
he engaged to mention their names to the king
and queen, and to place their merit and ser.

security of the Colony, he left Navidad on the

bours on the northern coast of the island. On

up with her, after a Separation of more than fix
weeks. Pinzon endeavoured to justify his con-
duct, by pretending that he had been driven
froml his courle by stress of weather, and pre-
vented from returning by contrary winds. The

and felt such fatisfation in this junction with
his consort, which delivered him from many
disquieting apprehensions, that lame as Pinzon's
apology was, he admitted of it without difficulty,
and reflored him to favour. During his absence
from the admiral, Pinzon had visited several
harbours in the island, had acquired some gold
by trafficking with the natives, but had made
no discovery of any importance.

The former, having suffered much during a
voyage of such an unusual length, were ex-
tremely leaky. The latter expressed the utmost
impatience to revisit their native country, from
which they had been so long absent, and where
they had things so wonderful and unheard-of
to relate. Accordingly, on the sixteenth of
January, he direced his course towards the
north-east, and soon loft fight of land. I-e had

of the people. The voyage was prosperous to
the fourteenth of February, and he had ad.

and continued to blow with increasing rage,
which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every

save the (hips. But it was impofiible to with.
stand the violence of the storm, and, as they
were still far from any land, deftruEtion seemed
inevitable. The sailors had recourse to prayers
to Almighty God, to the invocation of faints,
to vows and charms, to every thing that religion
dictates, or superstition suggests, to the affiighted

as that of a rath deluded adventurer, instead of
being tranfinitted with the honour due to the
author and condustor of the most noble enter-
prise that had ever been undertaken. These
reflections extinguished all sense of his own
personal danger. Less affeEted with the loss
of life, than solicitous to preserve the memory
of what he had attempted and atchieved, he
retired to his cabin, and wrote, upon parch-
ment, a short account of the voyage which he
had made, of the course which he had taken,
of the situation and riches of the countries
which he had discovered, and of the colony
that he had left there. Having wrapped up this
in an oiled cloth, which he inclosed in a cake
of wax, he put it into a cask carefully flopped
up, and threw it into the sea, in hopes that
some fortunate accident might preserve a deposit
of so much importance to the world'.

There, after a violent contest with the governor,
in which Columbus displayed no less spirit than
prudence, he obtained a supply of frelh provi.

cumftance, however, greatly disquieted him.
The Pinta, of which he had loft fight on the

dreaded for some time that flhe had foundered
at sea, and that all her crew had perified: after.

near the end of his voyage, and seemingly be-
yond the reach of any disaster, another ftorn
arose, little inferior to the former in violence;
and after driving before it during two days and

two nights, he was forced to take shelter in the B o O K
river Tagus. Upon application to the king of --
Portugal, he was allowed to come up to Lisbon ; Ma493.
and, notwithstanding the envy which it was
natural for the Portuguese to feel, when they
beheld another nation entering upon that pro-
vince of discovery which they had hitherto
deemed peculiarly their own, and in its first
essay, not only rivalling, but eclipsing their
fame, Columbus was received with all the
marks of diftintion due to a man who had
performed things so extraordinary and unex-
peEted. The king admitted him into his pre-
fence, treated him with the highest refpe&t, and
listened to the account which he gave of his
voyage with admiration mingled with regret.
While Columbus, on his part, enjoyed the
satisfaCtion of describing the importance of his
discoveries, and of being now able to prove the
solidity of his schemes to those very persons,
who, with an ignorance disgraceful to them-
selves, and fatal to their country, had lately
rejeced them as the projects of a visionary or
dcfigning adventurer d,

COLUMBUS was so impatient to return to Returns to

voyage. As soon as the lhip was discovered ap-
proaching the port, all the inhabitants of Palos
ran eagerly to the shore, in order to welcome
their relations and fellow-citizens, and to hear
tidings of their voyage. When the prosperous
issue of it was known, when they beheld the
strange people, the unknown animals, and fin.
gular productions brought from the countries
which had been discovered, the effusion of joy
was general and unbounded. The bells were
rung, the cannon fired ; Columbus was received
at landing with royal honours, and all the people,
in solemn procession, accompanied him and his
crew to the church, where they returned thanks
to Heaven, which had so wonderfully conducted
and crowned with success a voyage of greater
length and of more importance than had been
attempted in any former age. On the evcning
of the Iame day, he had the fatisfacdion of feeing

journey to Barcelona, the people crowded
from the adjacent country, following him
everywhere with admiration and applause. His
entrance into the city was conducted, by
order of Ferdinand and Isabella, with pomp
suitable to the great event, which added such
distinguishing lustre to their reign. The people

them were carried the ornaments of gold,

grains of gold found in the mountains, and dufl
of the fame metal gathered in the rivers. After
these, appeared the various commodities of the
new discovered countries, together with their

be reckoned a part of those vast regions in Asia,
comprehended under the general name of India.
This sentiment was confirmed by the obferv-
ations which he made concerning the produc-
tions of the countries he had discovered. Gold
was known to abound in India, and he had
met with such promising samples of it in the
islands which he visited, as led him to believe
that rich mines of it might be found. Cotton,
another production of the East Indies, wxas
common there. The pimento of the islands he
imagined to be a species of the Eart-Indian

opened to their ambition and avarice, neither the
length nor danger of the navigation intimidated
them. Cautious as Ferdinand was, and averse
to every thing new or adventurous, he seems to
have catched the fame spirit with, his fubjeEts.
Under its influence, preparations for a second
expedition were carried on with a rapidity un.
usual in Spain, and to an extent that would be
deemed not inconiiderable in the present age.
The fleet consisted of seventeen Ships, some of
which were of good burden. It had on board
fifteen hundred persons, among whom were
many of noble families, who had served in
honourable ltations. The greater part of these
being defined to remain in the country, were
furnished with every thing requisite for conquest
or settlement, with all kinds of European do-
meftic animals, with such feeds and plants as
were molt likely to thrive in the climate of the
Weft Indies, with utensils and instruments of
every fort, and with such artificers as might be
most useful in an infant colony k.

example of the Portuguele, as well as the super- confirmed
ftition of the age, made it necessary to obtain by the opl
from the Roman pontiff a grant of those terri-
tories which they wished to occupy. The Pope,
as the vicar and representative of Jesus Christ,
was supposed to have a right of dominion over
all the kingdoms of the earth. Alexander VI.
a pontiff infamous for every crime which dif-
graces humanity, filled the papal throne at that
time. As he was born Ferdinand's fubje&,
and very solicitous to secure the protecion of
Spain, in order to facilitate the execution of his
ambitious schemes in favour of his own family,
he was extremely willing to gratify the Spanish
monarchs. By an at of liberality which clft
him nothing, and that served to eflablifh the
jurifdifion and prctenfions of the papal fee, he
granted in full right to Ferdinand and Isabella
all the countries inhabited by Infidels, which they
had discovered, or should discover; and, in
virtue of that power which he derived from
Jesus Christ, he conferred on the crown of
Caflile van: regions, to the possession of which
lie himself was ol far from having any title, that

tugal, he appointed that a line, supposed to be
drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues to
the westward of the Azores, should serve as a
limit between them; and, in the plenitude of
his power, bestowed all to the east of this ima-
ginary line upon the Portuguese, and all to the
weft of it, upon the Spaniards '. Zeal for pro.
pagating the Christian faith was the consideration
employed by Ferdinand in soliciting this bull,
and is mentioned by Alexander as his chief
motive for issuing it. In order to manifest some
concern for this laudable object, several friars,
under the direction of Father Boyl, a Catalonian
monk of great reputation, as apoftolical vicar,
were 'appointed to accompany Columbus, and
to devote themselves to the inftruEtion of the

pursue that career of glory upon which he had
entered. He set fail from the bay of Cadiz on
the twenty-fifth of September, and touching
again at the island of Gomera, he iteered farther
towards the south than in his former voyage.
By holding this course, he enjoyed more fleadily
the benefit of the regular winds, which reign
within the tropics, and was carried towards a
large cluftter of islands, situated considerably to
the east of those which he had already disco-
vered. On the twenty-fixth day after his depart- Nov. 2.

of the Caribbee or Leeward Islands, to which
he gave the name of Defeada, on account of the
impatience of his crew to discover some part of

to supply it with the necessaries of which he

their own indiscretion and ill conduc, the Spa-
niards fpcedily effaced those favourable impref-
sions, and foori convinced the natives, that they
had all the wants, and weaknesses, and passions
of men. As soon as the powerful reltraint
which the presence and authority of Columbus
imposed was withdrawn, the garrison threw off
all regard for the officer whom he had invelted

Columbus perceived so clearly that this was not B o o K
a proper junEture for inquiring into his conduct I-_
with scrupulous accuracy, that he rejeEted the '493.
advice of several of his officers, who urged him
to seize the person of that prince, and to revenge
the death of their countrymen by attacking his
fubjeEts. He represented to them the neceflity
of securing the friendship of some potentate of
the country, in order to facilitate the settlement
which they intended, and the danger of driving
the natives to unite in some desperate attempt
against them, by such an ill-timed and unavailing
exercise of rigour. Intfead of wafting his time
in punishing palt wrongs, he took precautions
for preventing any future injury. With this
view he made choice of a situation more healthy
and commodious than that of Navidad. He
traced out the plan of a town in a large plain
near a spacious bay, and obliging every person
to put his hand to a work on which their com-
mon safety depended, the houses and ramparts
were soon so far advanced by their united
labour, as to afford them shelter and security.
This rising city, the first that the Europeans
founded in the New World, he named Isabella,

men, unaccustomed to the fatigue of bodily
labour, and all had engaged in the enterprise
with the sanguine hopes excited by the splendid
and exaggerated description of their countrymen
who returned from the first voyage, or by the
miflaken opinion of Columbus, that the country
which he had discovered was either the Cipango
of Marco Polo, or the Ophirr, from which
Solomon imported those precious commodities
which suddenly diffused such extraor dinary riches
through his kingdom. But when, instead of
that golden harvest which they had expeCted to
reap without toil or pains, the Spaniards saw that
their profpedt of wealth was remote as well as
uncertain, and that it could not be attained lut
by the flow and persevering efforts of induflry,

the disappointment of those chimerical hopes B O O K
occasioned such dejetion of mind as bordered -
on despair, and led to general discontent, In 1493
vain did Columbus endeavour to revive their
spirits by pointing out the fertility of the foil, and
exhibiting the specimens of gold daily brought
in from different parts of the island. They
had not patience to wait for the gradual returns
which the former might yield, and the latter
they despised as scanty and inconsiderable. The
spirit of difaffetion spread, and a conspiracy
was formed, which might have been fatal ro
Columbus and the colony. Happily he difcor
vered it, and seizing the ringleaders, punished
some of them, sent others prisoners into Spain,
whither he dispatched twelve of the ships which
had served as transports, with an earneld request
for a reinforcement of men and a large supply of
provisions'.

1494. followed him in person with the main body of
March n. his troops. In this expedition, h.e displayed all

the pomp of military magnificence that he could
exhibit, in order to trike the imagination of the
natives. He marched with colours flying, with
martial music, and with a small body of cavalry
that paraded sometimes in the fiont and some.
times in the rear. As those were the first horses
which appeared in the New World, they were
objects of terror no less than of admiration to
the Indians, who having no tame animals them-
selves, were unacquainted with that vail accef-
sion of power, which man hath acquired by
subjecting them to his dominion. They supposed
them to be rational creatures. They imagined
that the horse and the rider formed one animal,
with whose speed they were altonifhed, and whose
impetuosity and strength they confidered as
irresistible. But while Columbus endeavoured
to inspire the natives with a dread of his power,
he did not neglec the arts of gaining their love
and confidence. He adhered scrupulously to the
principles of integrity and justice in all his tranf-
acions with them, and treated them, on every
occasion, not only with humanity, but with
indulgence. The diflriE of Cibao answered the
description given of it by the natives. It was

mountainous

mountainous and uncultivated, but in every B o K
river and brook gold was gathered either in ,_
duff or in grains, some of which were of con- 3494.
fiderable size. The Indians had never opened
any mines in search of gold. To penetrate into
the bowels of the earth, and to refine the rude
ore, were operations too complicated and labo-
rious for their talents and industry, and they had
no such high value for gold as to put their inge-
nuity and invention upon the firetch in order to
obtain it'. The small quantity of that precious
metal which they possessed, was either picked up
in the beds of the rivers, or wathed from the
mountains by the heavy rains that fall within the
tropics. But, from those indications, the Spa-
niards could no longer doubt that the country
contained rich treasures in its bowels, of which
they hoped soon to be marters". In order to
secure the command of this valuable province,
Columbus ereEted a small fort, to which he gave
the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridicule upon
some of his incredulous followers, who would
not believe that the country prod'uced gold,
until they saw it with their own eyes, and
touched it with their hands '"

B o O K THE account of those promising appearances
,-__ of wealth in the country of Cibao came very
'494" seasonably to comfort the desponding colony,

The diftrers
and difaf- which was asseted with distresses of various
tsie colony kinds. The flock of provisions which had been
increaf. brought from Europe was moifly consumed;

what remained was so much corrupted by the
heat and moiflure of the climate, as to be almost
unfit for use; the natives cultivated so finall a
portion of ground, and with so little skill, that
it hardly yielded what was sufficient for their
own subsistence; the Spaniards at Isabella had
hitherto neither time nor leisure to clear the
foil, so as to reap any considerable fruits of their
own industry. On' all these accounts, they
became afraid of perishing with hunger, and
were' reduced already to a scanty allowance.
At the fame time, the diseases predominant in
the torrid zone; and which rage chiefly in thole
uncultivated countries, where the hand of in-
duitry has not opened the woods, drained the
marshes, and confined the rivers within a certain
chrannel, began to spread among them. Alarmed
at the violence and unusual symptoms of those
maladies, they exclaimed againflt Columbus and
his companions in the former voyage, who, by
their splendid hut deceitful dcfcriptions of Ilir-
paniola, had allured them to quit Spain for a

barbaro 1i;
e*

barbarous uncultivated land, where they must B o 0 K:
either be cut off by famine, or die of unknown n
diitempers. Several of the officers and persons 1494,
of note, instead of checking, joined in those
seditious complaints. Father Boyl, the apofto-
lical vicar, was one of the molt turbulent and
outrageous. It required all the authority and
address of Columbus to re-establish fubordina-
tion and tranquillity in the colony. Threats
and promises were alternately employed for this
purpose ; but nothing contributed more to sooth
the malcontents, than the profpee of finding,
in the mines of Cibao, such a rich store of
treasure as would be a recompence for all their
sufferings, and efface the memory of former
disappointments.

WHEN, by his unwearied endeavours, con- Colim.u;,

cord and order were so far restored, that he nevw iirco.
could venture to leave the ifiand, Columbus vcr is
resolved to pursue his discoverics, that he might
be able to ascertain whether thole new countries
with which he had opened a communication
were connected with any region of the earth
already known, or whether they were to be
confidered as a separate portion of the globe
hitherto unvisited. lHe appointed his brother
Don Diego, with the aflliance of a council of
officers, to govern the island in his abscnce;

B 0 0 K and gave the command of a body of soldiers to

3494- visit the different parts of the island, and endea-

vour to establish the authority of the Spaniards
among the inhabitants. Having left them very
particular instructions with refpet to their con-
duc, he weighed anchor on the twenty-fourth
of April, with one ship and two small barks
under his command. During a tedious voyage
of full five months, he had a trial of almost all
the numerous hardIhips to which persons of his
profession are exposed, without making any dif-
covery of importance, except the island of Ja-
maica. As he ranged along the southern coast
of Cuba , he was entangled in a labyrinth
formed by an incredible number of finall islands,
to which he gave the name of the Queen's
Garden. In this unknown course, among rocks
and shelves, he was retarded by contrary winds,
aflaulred with furious storms, and alarmed with
the terrible thunder and lightning which is often
alnmot incefant between the tropics. At length
his provisions fell Lhort; his crew, exhausted
with fatigue as well as hunger, murmured and

every occurrence with his own eyes, to issue
every order, and to superintend the execution '494,
of it. On no occasion, was the extent of his
ikill and experience as a navigator so much tried.
To these the squadron owed its safety. But
this unremitted fatigue of body, and intense ap-
plication of mind, overpowering his constitution,
though naturally vigorous and robust, brought
on a feverish disorder, which terminated in a
lethargy, that deprived him of sense and me-

to support themn long, and the island did not

soldiers under Margarita, as if they had been
set free from discipline and subordination,
scorned all restraint. Instead of conforming
to the prudent infirutions of Columbus, they
dispersed in straggling parties over the island,
lived at discretion upon the natives, wafted their
provisions, seized their women, and treated that
inofienfive race with all the insolence of military
oppreflion a.

As long as the Indians had any profpet that

their sufferings might come to a period by the
voluntary departure of the invaders, they sub-
mitted in silence, and diflembled their sorrow;
but they now perceived that the yoke would be
as permanent as it was intolcrable. The Spa-
niards had built a town, and surrounded it with
ramparts. They had erclted forts in different
places. They had encloed and fownl fc veral
fields. It was apparent that they came not to
visit the country, but to fettle in it. Though

to the laborious exertions of industry, that they
were satisfied with a proportion bs food amaz-
ingly small. A handful of maize, or a little
of the insipid bread made of the caffada-root,
was sufficient to support men, whose ftrengtli
and spirits were not exhaufled by'any vigorous
efforts either of body or mind. The Spaniards,
though the most abstemious of all the European
nations, appeared to them exceflively voracious.
One Spaniard consumed as much as several
Indians. This keenness of'appetite surprised
them so much, and seemed to be so insatiable,
that they supposed the Spaniards had left their

had long expeced that the Spaniards would B 0O K
retire of their own accord. They now per-
ceived that, in order to avert the deitrudion 1'4
with which they were threatened, either by the
flow consumption of famine, or by the violence
of their oppressors, it was neceflary to assume
courage, to attack those formidable invaders
with united force, and drive them fiom the
settlements of which they had violently taken
possession.

SUCH were the sentiments which universally war with

prevailed among the Indians, when Columbus
returned to Isabella. Inflamed by the unpro-
voked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree
of rage of which their gentle natures, formed to
susser and submit, seemed hardly susceptible,
they waited only for a signal from their leaders
to fall upon the colony. Some of the caziques
had already surprised and cut off several ftrag-
glers. The dread of this impending danger
united the Spaniards, and re-established the au-
thority of Columbus, as they saw no profped
of safety but in committing themselves to his
prudent guidance. It was now necessary to
have recourse to arms, the employing of which
against the Indians, Columbus had hitherto
avoided with the greatest solicitude. Unequal
as the conflic may feeln, between the naked

and troops accustomed to the discipline, and
provided with the initruments of deftrudion
known in the European art of war, the situation
of the' Spaniards was far from being exempt
from danger. The vast superiority of the na.
tives in number, compensated many defefs.
An handful of men was about to encounter a
whole nation. One adverse event, or even any
unforeseen delay in determining the fate of the
war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards. Con.
fcious that success depended on the vigour and
rapidity of his operations, Columbus instantly
assembled his forces. They were reduced to a
very small number. Diseases, engendered by
the warmth and humidity of the country, or
occasioned by their own licentiousness, had
raged among them with much violence; expe-
rience had not yet taught them the art either
of curing these, or the precautions requisite for
guarding againit them; two-thirds of the ori-
ginal adventurers were dead, and many of those

mention the last as composing part of a military I.-
force, they were not perhaps the least formi- '49S
dable and deftrudtive of the whole, when em-
ployed against naked and timid Indians. All
the caziques of the island, Guacanahari ex-
cepted, who retained an inviolable attachment
to the Spaniards, were in arms to oppose Co-
lumbus, with forces amounting, if we may be-
lieve the Spanish historians, to a hundred thou-
sand men. Instead of attempting to draw the
Spaniards into the fastnesses of the woods and
mountains, they were so imprudent as to take
their Ration in the Vega Real, the most open
plain in the country. Columbus did not allow
them time to perceive their error, or to alter
their position. He attacked them during the
night, when undisciplined troops are least capa-
ble of acting with union and concert, and ob-
tained an easy and bloodless victory. The con>
fternation with which the Indians were filled by
the noise and havock made by the firc-arms, by
the impetuous force of the cavalry, and the
fierce onset of the dogs, was so great, that they
threw down their weapons, and fled without
attempting refitance. Many were slain; more
were taken prisoners, and reduced to servitude d;

where gold was found, was obliged to pay quar.
terly as much gold duff as filled a hawk's bell;
from those in other parts of the country, twenty-
five pounds of cotton were demanded. This
was the firit regular taxation of the Indians,
and served as a precedent for exactions fill
more intolerable. Such an imposition was ex-
tremely contrary to those maxims which Co.
lumbus had hitherto inculcated, with refpcd to
the mode of treating them. But intrigues were
carrying on in the court of Spain at this junc.
ture, in order to undermine his power, and
discredit his operations, which confIrained him
to depart from his own fyfiem of administration.
Several unfavourable accounts of his conducl,

to his detriment. Many of the courtiers viewed
his growing reputation and power with envious
eyes. Fonseca, archdeacon of Seville, who was
entrusted with the chief direction of Indian
affairs, had conceived such an unfavourable
opinion of Columbus, for some reason which
the contemporary writers have not mentioned,
that he listened with partiality to every invective
against him. It was not easy for an unfriended

tera&t the machinations of so many enemies.

such a quantity of gold as would not only
jultify what he had reported with refpeEt to
the richness of the country, but encourage
Ferdinand and Isabella to persevere in pro-
fecuting his plans. The necefity of obtain-

heavy tax upon the Indians, but to exact pay-
ment of it with extreme rigour; and may be
pleaded in excuse for his deviating on this
occasion from the mildness and humanity with

Fatal effets THE labour, attention, and foresight, which
of that nmea-

the tribute demanded of them, appeared the
most intolerable of all evils, to men accustomed
to pass their days in a careless, improvident
indolence. They were incapable of such a re.
gular and persevering exertion of industry, and
felt it such a grievous restraint upon their
liberty, that they had recourse to an expedient
for obtaining deliverance from this yoke, which
demonstrates the excess of their impatience and
despair. They formed a scheme of tfarving
those oppressors whom they durst not attempt
to expel; and from the opinion which the)
entertained with refpe&t to the voracious appe.
tite of the Spaniards, they concluded the exe-
cution of it to be very practicable. With llis
view they suspendcd all the operations of agri.
culture; they sowed no maize, they pulled up
the roots of the manioc or caflada which were
planted, and retiring to the most inaccefible
parts of the mountains, left the uncultivated
plains to their enemies. T'his desperate reil-

lution produced in some degree the effeEts B o0 K
which they expected. The Spaniards were re- L-
duced to extreme want; but they received such 1495.
seasonable supplies of provisions from Europe,
and found so many resources in their own in-
genuity and industry, that they suffered no great
loss of men. The wretched Indians were the
viEtims of their own ill-concerted policy. A
great multitude of people, ,fiut up in the moun-
tainous or wooded part of the country, without
any food but the spontaneous produations of the
earth, soon felt the utmost distresses of famine.
This brought on contagious diseases; and, in
the course of a few months, more than a third
part of the inhabitants of the island perished,
after experiencing misery in all its various
forms'.

1'35' considerate ambition. His prudent attention to

preserve discipline and subordination was deno-
minated excess of rigour; the punishments which
he inflited upon the mutinous and disorderly
were imputed to cruelty. These accusations
gained such credit in a jealous court, that a
commiifoner was appointed to repair to Iif.
paniola, and to infpeEt into the conduct of Co-
lumbus. By the recommendation of his ene-
mies, Aguado, a groom of the bed-chamber,
was the person to whom this important trust
was committed. But in this choice they seem
to have been more influenced by the obsequious
attachment of the man to their interest, than by
his capacity for the station, Puffed up with
such sudden elevation, Aguado displayed, in
the exercise of this office, all the frivolous self-
importance, and acted with all the disgusting
insolence, which are natural to little minds,
when raised to unexpected dignity, or employed
in funCtions to which they are not equal. By
listening with eagerness to every accusation
against Columbus, and encouraging not only
the malcontent Spaniards, but even the Indians,
to produce their grievances, real or imaginary,
he fomented the spirit of dissension in the island,
without clsablinling any regulation of public

while such a partial infpe&or obfcrved his mo-

the resolution of returning to Spain, in order to
lay a full account of all his tranfaiions, parti-
cularly with refpeEt to the points in dispute
between him and his adversaries, before Ferdi-
nand and Isabella, from whose juflice and dif-
cernment he expe&ed an equal and a favourable
decision. He committed the administration of 1496.
affairs, during his absence, to Don Bartholomew
his brother, with the title of Adelantado, or
Lieutenant Governor. By a choice less fortu-
nate, and which proved the source of many
calamities to the colony, he appointed Francis

hardly be imputed to the admiral as a defe& in
naval skill, he was exposed to infinite fatigue
and danger, in a perpetual firuggle with the
trade-winds, which blow without variation from
the east between the tropics. Notwhithanding
the almost insuperable difficulties of such a navi-

patience and firmness, but made bs little way,
that he was three months without feeing land.
At length his provisions began to fail, the crew
was reduced to the scanty allowance of fix

But, even in this extreme distress, he retained
the humanity which distinguishes his charactr,

of their own facility in lending too favourable
an ear to frivolous or ill-founded accusations,
received him with such distinguished marks of
refpea as covered his enemies with shame.
Their censures and calumnies were no more
heard of at that juncture. The gold, the pearls,
the cotton, and other commodities of value
which Columbus produced, seemed fully to
refute what the malcontents had propagated
with refpeEt to the poverty of the country. By
reducing the Indians to obedience, and imposing
a regular tax upon them, he hsi.fecured to Spain
a large acceflion of new fubjets, and the elta-
blifhment of a revenue that promised to be
considerable. By the mines which he had found
out and examined, a source of wealth still more

A plan THE attentive consideration of all these cir-
fornied for
th mortrc- cumftances made such impression, not only upon
gular eita-
bJfhmc.t Isabella, who was flattered with the idea of

a colony, being the patroness of all Columbus's enter-

prises, but even upon Ferdinand, who, having
originally exprefled his disapprobation of his
schemes, was still apt to doubt of their success,
that they resolved to supply the colony in His-
paniola with every thing which could render it
a permanent establishment, and to furnish Co.
lumbus with such a fleet, that he might proceed
to search for those new countries, of whose
existence he seemed to be confident. The mea-
fures molt proper for accomplishing both these
designs were concerted with Columbus. Dif-
covery had been the sole obje: of the sirs voy-
age to the New World ; 'and though, in the
second, fettlemient had been proposed, the pre-
cautions taken for that purpose had either been
intfufficient, or were rendered ineffedual by the
mutinous spirit of the Spaniards, and the unfore-
fccn calamities arising from various causes. Now

a plan was to be formed of a regular colony, B o K
that might serve as a model in all future efta-
blifliments. Every particular was confidcred '496.
with attention, and the whole arranged with a
ferupulous accuracy. The precifc number of
adventurers who should be permitted to embark
was fixed. They were to be of different ranks
and profeflions ; and the proportion of each was
eltablifhed, according to their usefulness and the
wants of the colony. A suitable number of
women was to be chosen to accompany there
new settlers. As it was the first objec to raise
provisions in a country where fearcity of food
had been the occasion of so much dil-refs, a
considerable body of husbandmen was to be car-
ried over. As the Spaniards had then no con-
ception of deriving any benefit from those pro-
dulcions of the New World which have since
yielded such large returns of wealth to Europe,
but had formed magnificent ideas, and cnter-
tained sanguine hopes with refpcct to the riclich
contained in the mines which had been diCco-
vered, a band of workmen, fiilled in the various
arts employed in digging and refining the pre-
cious metals, was provided. All these emi-
grants were to receive pay and fubfiftcncc for

been fatal to so many of their countrymen,
Columbus proposed to transport to Hispaniola
such malefactors as had been convicted of
crimes, which, though capital, were of a less
atrocious nature; and that for the future a
certain proportion of the offenders usually sent
to the gallies, ihould be condemned to labour
in the mines which were to be opened. This
advice, given without due reflection, was as
inconsiderately adopted. The prisons of Spain
were drained, in order to collec members for
the intended colony; and the judges empowered
to try criminals were instructed to recruit it by
their future sentences. It is not, however, with
such materials that the foundations of a society,
destined to be permanent, Ihould be laid. In-
duftry, fobricty, patience, and mutual confidence
are indispensably rcquifite in an infant fettle-
ment, where purity of morals must contribute
more towards eflablifling order, than the ope-
ration or authority of laws. But when such a

before the favourable wind for such a course, 9
which blows invariably between the tropics.
With this idea he set fail, and touched first at May 3o.
the Canary, and then at the Cape de Verd
islands. From the former he dispatched three July 4.
of his ships with a supply of provisions for the
colony in Hispaniola: with the other three, he
continued his voyage towards the south. No
remarkable occurrence happened until they ar-
rived within five degrees of the line. There July ig.
they were becalmed, and at the fame time the
heat became so excefive, that many of their
wine calks burif, the liquor in others foured,
and their provisions corrupted P. The Spaniards,
who had never ventured so far to the south,
were afraid that the ships would take fire, and
began to apprehend the reality of what the an-
cients had taught concerning the defructive
qualities of that torrid region of the globe.
They were relieved, in some measure, from
their fears by a seasonable fall of rain. This,
however, though so heavy and unintermitting
that the men could hardly keep the deck, did
not greatly mitigate the intenseness of the heat.

vered a considerable island, which the admiral
called Trinidad, a name it still retains. It lies
on the coast of Guiana, near the mouth of the
Orinoco. This, though a river only of the
third or fourth magnitude in the New World,
far surpasses any of the streams in our hemi,
sphere. It rolls towards the ocean such a vas
body of water, and rushes into it with such im-
petuous force, that when it meets the tide,
which on that coast rifes to an uncommon
height, their collision occasions a swell and agi-

ocean many leagues with its flood . Columbus, < _
before he could perceive the danger, was en- '493'
tangled among those adverse currents and tem-
pefluous waves, and it was with the utmofl
difficulty that he 'escaped through a narrow
strait, which appeared so tremendous, that he
called it La IBoca del Drago. As soon as the
consternation which this occasioned, permitted
him to reflec upon the nature of an appearance
so extraordinary, he discerned in it a source of
comfort and hope. He justly concluded, that
such a vast body of water as this river contained,
could not be supplied by any island, but must
flow through a country of immense extent, and
of consequence that he was now arrived at that
continent which it had long been the objeEt of
his withes to discover. Full of this idea, he
flood to the weft along the coast of those pro.
vinces which are now known by the names of
Paria and Cumana. He landed in several places,
and had some intercourse with the people, who
resembled those of Hispaniola in their appear-
ance and manner of life. They wore, as orna-
ments, small plates of gold, and pearls of confi-
derable value, which they willingly exchanged
for European toys. They seemed to possess a

affairs of the colony in such a situation, as A g 30.

of which he flood so much in need.

MANY revolutions had happened in that coun- tarte of

try during his absence. His brother, the ade- oli;s;-

admiral gave before his departure, had removed
the colony from Isabella to a more commodious
flation, on the opposite fide of the island, and
laid the foundation of St. Domingo ", which was
long the most considerable European town in
the New World, and the feat of the supreme
courts in the Spanish dominions there. As soon
as the Spaniards were established in this new set-
tiement, the adelantado, that they might neither
languish in inactivity, nor have leisure to form
new cabals, marched into those parts of the
island which his brother had not yet visited or
reduced to obedience. As the people were
unable to resist, they submitted everywhere to
the tribute which he imposed. But they soon
found the burden to be so intolerable, that,

was neither dangerous nor of doubtful issue.
Mutiny of BUT while the adelantado was employed

against them in the field, a mutiny, of an asped
far more alarming, broke out among the Spa-
niards. The ringleader of it was Francis Roldan,
whom Columbus had placed in a station which
required him to be the guardian of order and
tranquillity in the colony. A turbulent and
inconsiderate ambition precipitated him into this
desperate measure, so unbecoming his rank.
The arguments which he employed to reduce
his countrymen were frivolous and ill-founded.
He accused Columbus and his two brothers of
arrogance and severity; he pretended that they
aimed at establishing an independent dominion
in the country; he taxed them with an inten.
tion of cutting off part of the Spaniards by
hunger and fatigue, that they might more easily
reduce the remainder to fubjecion; he repre.
sented it as unworthy of Caltilians, to remain
the tame and paflive slaves of three Genoese ad-
venturers. As men have always a propensity
to impute the hardships of which they feel the
pressure, to the mifconduEt of their rulers; as
every nation views with a jealous eye the power

and

and exaltation of foreigners, Roldan's infinua. B o O K
tions made a deep impression on his countrymen. ,
His character and rank added weight to them, .498
A considerable number of the Spaniards made
choice of him as their leader, and taking arms
against the adelantado and his brother, seized
the king's magazine of provisions, and endea-
voured to surprise the fort at St. Domingo.
This was preserved by the vigilance and courage
of Don Diego Columbus. The mutineers were
obliged to retire to the province of Xaragua,
where they continued not only to disclaim the
adelantado's authority themselves, but excited
the Indians to throw off the yoke w.

SUCH was the diftrafted slate of the colony

when Columbus landed at St. Domingo. He
was astonished to find that the three ships which
he had dispatched from the Canaries were not
yet arrived. By the unfkilfulnels of the pilots,
and the violence of currents, they had been car-
ried a hundred and sixty miles to the weft of
St. Domingo, and forced to take shelter in a
harbour of the province of Xaragua, where
Roldan and his seditious followers were can-
toned. Roldan carefully concealed from the
commanders of the ihips his infurrction againfs

settlers whom they brought over, that they
might proceed by land to St. Domingo. It re-
quired but few arguments to prevail with those
men to espouse his cause. They were the refuse
of the jails of Spain, to whom idleness, licen.
tioufnefs, and deeds of violence were familiar;
and they returned eagerly to a course of life
nearly resembling that to which they had been
accustomed. The commanders of the ships
perceiving, when it was too late, their impru.
dence in disembarking so many of their men,
flood away for St. Domingo, and got safe into
the port a few days after the admiral; but their
stock of provisions was so wafted during a

in which, whatever party prevailed, the power ,_
and firength of both mufft be so much wafTed, '498
as might encourage the common enemy to unite
and complete their deftrufion. At the fame
time, he observed, that the prejudices and pas.
lions which incited the rebels to take arms,
had so far infeced those who fill adhered to
him, that many of them were adverse, and all
cold to the service. From such sentiments, with
refpe& to the public interest, as well as from
this view of his own situation, he chose to
negociate rather than to fight. By a seasonable
proclamation, offering free pardon to such as
ihould merit it by returning to their duty; he
made impression upon some of 'the malcontents.
By engaging to grant such as should desire it the
liberty of returning to Spain, he allured all
those unfortunate adventurers, who, from sick-
ness and disappointment, were disgusted with the
country. By promising to re-cflablifh Roldan
in his former office, he toothed his pride; and,
by complying with moit of his demands in
behalf of his followers, he satisfied their avarice.
Thus, gradually and without bloodshcd, but
after many tedious negociations, he diflblved
this dangerous combination which threatened
the colony with ruin; and rcflorcd the appear-

BUT,

B O K BUT, previous to the relating of these, it is
.-,,._ proper to take a view of some events, which

T499. merit attention, both on account of their own

The vcyage
of Vasco de importance, and their connection with the history
Carea to the
E.,t ndieF, of the New World. While Columbus was
by the Cape
oc Good engaged in his successive voyages to the weft, the
Ilo)e. spirit of discovery did not languish in Portugal,

the kingdom where it first acquired vigour, and
became enterprising. Self-condemnation and
regret were not the only sentiments to which the
success of Columbus, and refletion upon their
own imprudence in rejeEting his proposals, gave
rife among the Portuguese. They excited a
general emulation to surpass his performances,
and an ardent desire to make some reparation to
their country for their own error. With this
view, Emanuel, who inherited the enterprising
genius of his predecessors, persisted in their
grand scheme of opening a passage to the East
Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, and soon after
his accession to the throne, equipped a squadron
for that important voyage. He gave the com-
nland of it to Vasco de Gama, a man of noble
birth, poflefled of virtue, prudence, and courage,
equal to the itation. The squadron, like all those
fitted out for discovery in the infancy of naviga-
tion, was extremely feeble, confifing only of
three veflels, of neither burden nor force ade-
quate to the service. As the Europeans were at

that

that time little acquainted with the course of the B O O K
trade-winds and periodical monsoons, which ..
render navigation in the Atlantic ocean, as well '499
as in the Tea that separates Africa from India,
at some seasons easy, and at others not only dan-
gerous, but almost impracticable, the time chosen
for Gama's departure was the mofi improper
during the whole year. He set fail from Lisbon '497-
on the ninth of July, and flanding towards the
south, had to struggle for four months with
contrary winds, before he could reach the Cape
of Good Hope. Here their violence began to Nov. 7..
abate; and during an interval of calm weather,
Gama doubled that formidable promontory,
which had so long been the boundary of naviga-
tion, and directed his course towards the north-
eait, along the African coast. He touched at
several ports; and after various adventures,
which the Portuguese hiflorians relate with high
but just encomiums upon his conduct and intre-
pidity, he came to anchor before the city of
Melinda. Throughout all the vafi countries
which extend along the coast of Africa, from
the river Senegal to the confines of Zanguebar,
the Portuguese had found a race of men rude
and uncultivated, firangers to letters, to arts,
and commerce, and differing fiom the inhabit-
ants of Europe, no lcfs in their features and
complexion, than in their manners and inflitu-

tions.

B O O K tions. As they advanced from this, they ob-
I '- _iferved, to their inexpreflible joy, that the human
'499- form gradually altered and improved; the

Asiatic features began to predominate, marks of
civilization appeared, letters were known, the
Mahometan religion was established, and a corn
merce, far from being inconsiderable, was car-
ried on. At that time several vessels from India
were in the port of Melinda. Gana now pur-
sued his voyage with almost absolute certainty of
success, and, under the condut of a Mahometan
pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon the coast of Ma-
labar, on the twenty-fecond of May one thou.
sand four hundred and ninety-eight. What he
beheld of the wealth, the populousness, the cul-
tivation, the indufiry, and arts of this highly.
civilized country, far surpassed any idea that he
had formed, from the imperfeEt accounts which
the Europeans had hitherto received of it. But
as he poffiffed neither fufficicnt force to attempt
a settlement, nor proper commodities with which
he could carry on commerce of any confe.
quence, he hastened back to Portugal, with an
account of his success in performing a voyage,
the longefl, as well as most difficult, that had
ever been made, since the firfl invention of
navigation. He landed at Lisbon on the four-
teenth of September, one thousand four hun.

THus, during the course of the fifteenth cen-

tury, mankind made greater progress in explor-
ing the ltate of the habitable globe, than in all
the ages which had elapsed previous to that
period. The spirit of discovery, feeble at first
and cautious, moved within a very narrow
sphere, and made its efforts with hesitation and
timidity. Encouraged by success, it became
adventurous, and boldly extended its operations.
In the course of its progreflion, it continued to
acquire vigour, and advanced at length with a
rapidity and force which burst through all the
limits within which ignorance and fear had
hitherto circumscribed the activity of the human
race. Almost fifty years were employed by the
Portuguese in creeping along the coalt of Africa
from Cape Non to Cape de Verd, the latter of
which lies only twelve degrees to the south of
the former. In less than thirty years they ven-
tured beyond the equinoctial line into another
hemisphere, and penetrated to the southern extre-
mity of Africa, at the distance of forty-nine
degrees from Cape de Verd. During the last
seven years of the century, a New World was

B 0 K discovered in the weft, not inferior in extent to

11.
»^-_-^ all the parts of the earth with which mankind

'499' were at that time acquainted. In the east, un-

known seas and countries were found out, and
a communication, long desired, but hitherto
concealed, was opened between Europe and the
opulent regions of India. In comparison with
events so wonderful and unexpeced, all that
had hitherto been deemed great or splendid,
faded away and disappeared. Vafi objecs now
presented themselves. The human mind, roused
and interested by the profpet, engaged with
ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its active
powers in a new direction.

Dircoveries THIS spirit of enterprise, though but newly
-arried on in
Spain by awakened in Spain, began soon to operate exten-
,itu rerd- fively. Allthe attempts towards discovery made

in that kingdom had hitherto been carried on by
Columbus alone, and at the expence of the
sovereign. But now private adventurers, allured
by the magnificent descriptions he gave of the
regions which he had visited, as well as by the
specimens of their wealth which he produced,
offered to fit out squadrons at their own rilk,
and to go in quest of new countries. T'he
Spanili court, whose scanty revenues were ex-
haufled by the charge of its expeditions to tle
New World, which, though they opened alluring

profpels

profpeEts of future benefit, yielded a very B o o Ri

11.

sparing return of present profit, was extremely __
willing to devolve the burden of discovery upon 1499.
its fubjeEts. It seized with joy an opportunity
of rendering the avarice, the ingenuity, and
efforts of projectors, instrumental in promoting
designs of certain advantage to the public,
though of doubtful success with refpedt to them-
selves. Oneof the first propositions of this kind Ojeda the
was made by Alonfo de Ojeda, a gallant and fit Ls tfa
active officer, who had accompanied Columbus
in his second voyage. His rank and character
procured him such credit with the merchants of
Seville, that they undertook to equip four fliips,
provided he could obtain the royal licence, autho-
rising the voyage. The powerful patronage of
the bilhop of Badajos easily secured success in a
fiit so agreeable to the court. Without consult-
ing Columbus, or regarding the rights and jurif-
diction which he had acquired by the capitula-
tion in one thousand four hundred and ninety-
two, Ojeda was permitted to set out for the New
World. In order to direct his course, the bishop
communicated to him the admiral's journal of
his last voyage, and his charts of the countries
which he had discovered. Ojeda struck out May.
into no new path of navigation, but adhering ser-
vilely to the route which Columbus had taken,
arrived on the coast of Paria. He traded with

II. .L_ < as far as Cape de Vela, and ranged along a con.
'499. fiderable extent of coafl beyond that on which

Columbus had touched. Having thus afcer.
tained the opinion of Columbus, that this coun.
Oaobcr. try was a part of the continent, Ojeda returned

by way of Hispaniola to Spain, with some repu.
tation as a discoverer, but with little benefit
to those who had railed the funds for the expe.
dition .

1saccompa- AMIERIGO VESPUCCI, a Florentine gentleman,
l:i:4 by
Ame,,ieo accompanied Ojeda in this voyage. In what fta-
elP"tci.' tion he served, is uncertain; but as he was an

experienced sailor, and eminently ikilful in all
the sciences subservient to navigation, he seems
to have acquired such authority among his com.
panions, that they willingly allowed him to have
a chief share in directing their operations during
the voyage. Soon after his return, he tranf-
mitted an account of his adventures and disco-
veries to one of his countrymen;. and labourin:
with the vanity of a traveller to magnify his owi
exploits, he had the address and confidence to
frame his narrative, so as to make it appear tlial h:
had the glory of having first discovered the con-
tinent in the New World. Amerigo's account

1 lcrcera, dec. i. lib. iv. c. r, 2, 3.

was drawn up not only with art, but with some B o o K.
elegance. It contained an amusing history of _
his voyage, and judicious observations upon the '499'
natural productions, the inhabitants, and the
customs of the countries which he had visited.
As it was the first description of any part of the
New World that was publifhled, a performance
tb well calculated to gratify the passion of man-
kind for what is new and marvellous, circulated
rapidly, and was read with admiration. The FromwloMn
country of which Amerigo was supposed to be Amraica is
the discoverer, came gradually to be called by g'v Ot d
his name. The caprice' of mankind, often as
unaccountable as unjust, has perpetuated this
error. By the universal content of nations,
AMERICA is the name bestowed on this new
quarter of the globe. The bold pretensions of a
fortunate impoRtor have robbed the discoverer of
the New World of a diflintion which belonged
to him. The name of Amerigo has supplanted
that of Columbus; and mankind may regret
an adt of injultice, which, having received
the fantion of time, it is now too late to
redress '.

and malevolence of the people under his corn-

ened the force of the inutineers, it did not cx-
tirpate the feeds of di`cord out of the ifiand.
Several of the malcontents continued in arms,
refuting to submit to the admiral. He- and his

punish their crimes. The perpetual occupation
and disquiet which this created, prevented him

which the discovery of a New World occa- 1500'
sioned, and fame alone was not an objec to
satisfy the cold intcrefted mind of Ferdinand.
The nature of commerce was then so little un-
derftood, that, where immediate gain was not
acquired, the hope of diflant benefit, or of flow
and moderate returns, was tutally disregarded.
Ferdinand confidered Spain, on this account,
as having loft by the enterprise of Columbus,
and imputed it to his mifconduc and incapacity
for government, that a country abounding in
gold had yielded nothing of value to its con-
querors. Even Isabella, who fiom the favour-

had uniformly protected him, was llaken at

culers, and began to fufpeE that a difaffecdion
so general must have been occasioned by real
grievances, which called for redress. The bishop
of Badajos, with his usual aninofity against Co-
lumbus, encouraged there suspicions, and con-
firmed them.

As soon as the queen began to give way to Faritrc as

fede him, and assume the government of the
island. It was impoflible to escape condemna-
tion, when this prepoflerous cominifion male
it the interefl of the judge to pronounce the
person whom 'he was sent to try, guilty.
Though Columbus had now composed all the
dissensions in the island; though he had brought
both Spaniards and Indians to submit peaceably
to his government; though he had made fuclh
effedual provision for working the mines, and
cultivating -the country, as would have secureel
a considerable revenue to the king, as well as
large profits to individuals, Bovadilla, without
deigning to attend to the nature or merit of
those services, discovered, from the moment that
he landed in Hispaniola, a determined purpose
of treating him as a criminal. He took pof-
session of the admiral's house in St. Domingo,
from which its master happened at that time to
be absent, and seized his cfliets, as if his guilt
had been already fully proved; he rendered
himself master of the fort and of the king's
stores by violence; he required all persons to
acknowledge him as supreme governor; lie set
at liberty the prironers confined by the admiral,

conduit. He submitted t.- the will of his fove-
reigns with a refieftful fi!ince, and repaired
directly to the court of that violent and partial
judge whom they had authorized to try him.
Bovadilla, without admitting him into his pre-
fence, ordered him inflantly to be arrested, to
be loaded with chains, and hurried on board a
ship. Even under this humiliating reverse of
fortune, the firmness of mind which distinguishes
the charater of Columbus, did not forsake him.
Conscious of his own integrity, and solacing
himself with reflecting upon the great things
which he had atchieved, he endured this intult
offered to his charader, not only with compo.
fire, but with dignity. Nor had he the confo-
lation of sympathy to mitigate his sufferings.
3ovadilla had already rendered himself so ex-
tremely popular, by granting various immunities
to the colony, by liberal donations of Indians to
all who applied for them, and by relaxing the

a_-_» Spaniards, who were morfly adventurers, whom

150°0 their indigence or crimes had impelled to aban-

don their native country, exprefled the mod
indecent fatisfaAion with the disgrace and im-
prifbnment of Columbus. They flattered them-
selves, that now they flould enjoy an uncon-
trolled liberty, more suitable to their disposition
and former habits of life. Among persons thus
prepared to censure the proceedings, and to
asperse the characer of Columbus, Bovadilla
colleced materials for a charge against him.
All accusations, the molt improbable, as well as
inconsistent, were received. No informer, how-
ever infamous, was rejected. The refilt of this
inquest, no less indecent, than partial, he tranf-
mitted to Spain. At the fame time, he ordered
Columbus, with his two brothers, to be carried
thither in fetters; and, adding cruelty to insult,
he confined them in different flips, and excluded
them from the comfort of that friendly inter-
course which might have soothed their common
distress. But while the Spaniards in Hispaniola
viewed the arbitrary and insolent proceedings
of Bovadilla with a general approbation, which
reflets dishonour upon their name and country,
one man still retained a proper sense of the great
adions which Columbus had performed, and
was touched with the lentiments of veneration

3 antd

and pity due to his rank, his age, and his merit. B oO K
Alonfo de Vallejo, the captain of the vessel on _-
board which the admiral was confined, as soon '500-
as he was clear of the island, approached his
prisoner with great refpe&, and offered to re-
lease him from the fetters with which he was
unjustly loaded. " No," replied Columbus,
with a generous indignation, " I wear these
irons in consequence of an order from my fove-
reigns. They shall find me as obedient to this
as to their other injuncions. By their com-
mand I have been confined, and their command
alone thall let me at liberty '."

B 00 K been such an eminent benefacor, as well as

againit the ingratitude of the princes whose
'5°o. reign he had rendered illustrious. Ashamed of

their own condudt, and eager not only to make
some reparation for this injury, but to efface the
stain which it might fix upon their character,
ec. '7 they instantly issued orders to set Columbus at

liberty, invited him to court, and remitted money
to enable him to appear there in a manner suit-
able to his rank. When he entered the royal
pretence, Columbus threw himself at the feet of
his sovereigns. IIe remained for some time
silent; the various paflions which agitated his
mind suppressing his power of utterance. At
length he recovered himself, and vindicated his
conduEt in a long discourse, producing the most
satisfying proofs of his own integrity, as well as
good intention, and evidence, no less clear, of
the malevolence of his enemies, who, not satis-
fled with having ruined his fortune, laboured to
deprive him of what alone was now left, his
honour and his fame. Ferdiinand received him
with decent civility, and Isabella with tenderness
and refpet. They both exprcfled their sorrow
for what had happened, disavowed their know-
ledge of it, and joined in promising him pro-
teceion and future favour. But though they
initantly degraded Bovadilla, in order to remove
from themselves any suspicion of having autho-

rifed his violent proceedings, they did not restore B O O K
to Columbus his jurifdieion and privileges as '-
viceroy of those countries which he had disco- '500
vered. Though willing to appear the avengers
of Columbus's wrongs, that illiberal jealousy
which prompted them to invest Bovadilla with
such authority as put it in his power to treat the
admiral with indignity fiill subsisted. They were
afraid to trust a man to whom they had been so
highly indebted, and retaining him at court
under various pretexts, they appointed Nicholas
de Ovando, a knight of the military order of
Alcantara, governor of HIifpaniolak'

extremely requisite, in order to flop the inconfi-
derate career of Bovadilla, whose imprudent ad-
miniltration threatened the settlement with ruin.
Conscious of the violence and iniquity of his
proceedings against Columbus, he continued to
make it his sole object to gain the favour and
support of his countrymen, by accommodating
himself to their passions and prejudices. With
this view, he established regulations, in every
point the reverse of those which Columbus
deemed essential to the prosperity of the colony.
Inlead of the revere discipline, necessary in
order to habituate the dissolute and corrupted

a state of complete servitude. As the avarice of
the Spaniards was too rapacious and impatient
to try any method of acquiring wealth but that
of searching for gold, this servitude became as
grievous as it was unjust. The Indians were
driven in crowds to the mountains, and com.
pelled to work in the mines by masters, who
imposed their talks without mercy or discretion.
Labour, so disproportioned to their strength and
former habits of life, wafted that feeble race of
men with such rapid consumption, as must have

Bovadilla resigned his charge, and was corn B 0 0 K
manded to return initantly to Spain, in order to
answer for his conduct. Roldan, and the other 150"
ringleaders of the mutineers, who had been
molt active in opposing Columbus, were required
to leave the island at the fame time. A procla-
mation was issued, declaring the natives to be
free fubjets of Spain, of whom no service was
to be exated contrary to their own inclination,
and without paying them an adequate price for
their labour. With refpet to the Spaniards
themselves, various regulations were made,
tending to suppress the licentious spirit which
had been so fatal to the colony, and to establish
that reverence for law and order on which society
is founded, and to which it is indebted for its
increase and stability. In order to limit the
exorbitant gain which private persons were
supposed to make by working the mines, an
ordinance was publifled, directing all the gold
to be brought to a public finelting-houfe, and
declaring one half of it to be the property of the
crown 0.

B O o i in the unpleasant employment of soliciting the
_c^^ favour of an ungrateful court, and, notwithftand-
1502- ing all his merit and services, he solicited in

vain. He demanded, in terms of the original
capitulation in one thousand four hundred and
ninety-two, to be reinflated in his office of vice.
roy over the countries which he had discovered.
By a strange fatality, the circumitance which
he urged in support of his claim, determined a
jealous monarch to rejet it. The greatness of
his discoveries, and the profpet of their increaf.
ing value, made Ferdinand confider the concef.
sions in the capitulation as extravagant and
impolitic. He was afraid of entrusting a subjed
with the exercise of a jiurifdition that now
appeared to be so extremely ex;enfive, and might
grow t; be no less formidable. He inspired
l:aiF:lla wi;ii the fame suspicions; and under
various pretexts equally frivolous and unjust,
they eluded all Columnbus's requisitions to per.
form that which a solemn compaft bound them
to accomplifli. After attending the court of
Spain for near two years, as an humble suitor,
he found it impoflible to remove Ferdinand'i
prejudices and apprehenliions; and perceived,
it kItnth, that he laboured in vain, when he
urged a claim of juflice or merit with an inlc.
rected and unfeeling prince.

B 'i,

BUT even this ungenerous return did not dif- 1B o o I

courage him from pursuing the great obje ct
which first called forth his inventive genius, Iso 1ms
and excited him to attempt discovery. To open nlw

f' htr..)esof

a new palfage to the East Indies was his original diiiovwry.
and favourite scheme. This still engrossed his
thoughts; and either from his own observations
in his voyage to Paria, or from some obscure hint
of the natives, or from the accounts given by
Baftidas and de la Cosa, of their expedition, he
conceived an opinion that, beyond the continent
of America, there was a sea which extended to
the Eaf Indies, and hoped to find some strait or
narrow neck of land, by which a communication
might be opened with it and the part of the
ocean already known. By a very fortunate con-
jecdure, he supposed this strait or iflhmus to be
situated near the gulf of Darien. Full of this
idea, though he was now of an advanced age,
worn out with fatigue, and broken with infir-
mities, he offered, witl the alacrity of a youthful
adventurer, to underta!ke a voyage :which would
ascertain this important point, and perfect the
grand scheme which from the beginnhig he pro.
posed to accomplish. Several circuiiiniances
concurred in dlil)fpoing Ferdlinandcl and Ifatbella
to lend a favourable ear to this proposal. They
were glad to have the pretext of any honourable
employment for removing from court a man with

B O K whose demands they deemed it impolitic to

11.

_--.ys- comply, and whose services it was indecent to

'50 negle&. ~Though unwilling to reward Columbus,
they were not insensible of his merit, and from
their experience of his ikill and condut, had
reason to give credit to his conjeEtures, and to
confide in his success. To these considerations,
a third mull be added of still more powerful
influence. About this time the Portuguese fleet,
under Cabral, arrived from the Indies; and, by
the richness of its cargo, gave the people of
Europe a more perfet idea than they had
hitherto been able to form, of the opulence and
fertility of the east. The Portuguese had been
more fortunate in their discoveries than the
Spaniards. They had opened a communication
with countries where industry, arts, and elegance
flouriflled; and where commerce had been
longer established, and carried to greater extent,
than in any region of the earth. Their filll
voyages thither yielded immediate as well as
vast returns of profit, in commodities extremely
precious and in great requelt. Lisbon became
immediately the feat of commerce and wealth;
while Spain had only the cxpecation of remote
benefit, andoffuturegain, from the western world.
Nothing, then, could be more acceptable to the
Spaniards than Columbus's offer to condud
theml to the east, by a route which he cx-

Ipctecl

peded to be shorter, as well as less danger- B o K
ous, than that which the Portuguese had *
taken. Even Ferdinand was roused by such 'si.
a profpet, and warmly approved of the under-
taking.

BUT interesting as the object of this voyage is foulith

was to the nation, Columbus could procure voyase.
only four finall barks, the largest of which did
not exceed seventy tons in burden, for perform-
ing it. Accuflomed to brave danger, and to
engage in arduous undertakings with inade-
quate force, he did not hesitate to accept the
command of this pitiful squadron. His brother
Bartholomew, and his second son Ferdinand,
the historian of his actions, accompanied him.
He failed from Cadiz on the ninth of May, and
touched, as usual, at the Canary islands; from
thence he proposed to have flood direcly for
the continent; but his largest vessel was so
clunmfy and unfit for service, as constrained him
to bear away for Hiipaniola, in hopes of ex-
changing her for foine ship of the fleet that had
carried out Ovando. Vhen lie arrived at St. June 29.
Domingo, he found eighteen of there ships
ready loaded, and on the point of departing for
Spain. Columbus immlediately acquainted the
governor with the dellination of his voyage, and

QI.| tilth

B o0 K the accident which had obliged him to alter his
A_-..- route. He requested permission to enter the
'S'" harbour, not only that he might negociate the

exchange of his ship, but that he might take
Ihelter during a violent hurricane, of which he
discerned the approach from various prognostics,
which his experience and sagacity had taught
him to observe. On that account, he advised
him likewise to put off for some days the depart.
ure of the fleet bound for Spain. But Ovando
refused his request, and despised his counsel.
Under circumitances in which humanity would
have afforded refuge to a firanger, Columbus
was denied admittance into a country of which
he had discovered the exiflence and acquired
the poffeflion. His salutary warning, which
merited the greatest attention, was regarded as the
dream of a visionary prophet, who arrogantly pre-
tended to predic an event beyond the reach of
human foresight. The fleet set fail for Spain.
Next night the hurricane came on with dreadful
impetuosity. Columbus, aware of the danger,
took precautions against it, and saved his little
squadron. The fleet destined for Spain met
with the fate which the rashness and obflinacy
of its commanders deserved. Of eighteen ships
two or three only escaped. In this general
wreck perified Bovadilla, Roldan, and the

greater

greater part of those who had been the moit B 0 0 K
active in persecuting Columbus, and oppressing .-,
the Indians. Together with themselves, all the '5°;'
wealth which they had acquired by their injuf-
tice and cruelty was swallowed up. It exceeded
in value two hundred thousand pesos; an im-
menie fum at that period, and sufficient not
only to have screened them from any severe
scrutiny into their conduct, but to have secured
them a gracious reception in the Spanish court.
Among the Ihips that escaped, one had on board
all the effects of Columbus which had been re-
covered from the ruins of his fortune. Hifto-
rians, struck with the exac discrimination of
characters, as well as the just distribution of
rewards and punishments, conspicuous in those
events, universally attribute them to an imme-
diate interposition of Divine Providence, in order
to avenge the wrongs of an injured man, and to
punish the oppressors of an innocent people.
Upon the ignorant and superstitious race of
men, who were witnesses of this occurrence, it
made a different impreflion. From an opinion
which vulgar admiration is apt to entertain with
refpet to persons who have difltinguifhed them-
selves by their sagacity and inventions, they
believed Columbus to be pofilffed of super-
natural powers, and imagined that he had con-
jured up this dreadful itorm by magical art and

inhabitants of the continent, who arrived in a
large canoe. They appeared to be a people
more civilized, and who had made greater pro.

whom he had hitherto discovered. In return
to the inquiries which the Spaniards made, with
their usual eagerncfs, concerning the places
where the Indians got the gold which they wore
by way of ornament, they directed them to
countries situated to the weft, in which gold
was found in such profuiion, that it was applied
to the most common uses. Instead of fleerilg
in quest of a country so inviting, which would
have conducted him along the coast of Yucatan

east towards the gulf of Darien. In this navi. B oo o
gation he discovered all the coast of the conti-
nent, from Cape Gracias a Dios, to a harbour 150o.
which, on account of its beauty and security,
he called Porto Bello. He searched, in vain,
for the imaginary itrait, through which he ex-
pested to make' his way into an unknown sea;
and though he went on shore several times, and
advanced into the country, he did not penetrate
so far as to cross the narrow isthmus which fepa-
rates the gulf of Mexico from the great southern
ocean. He was so much delighted, however,
with the fertility of the country, and conceived
such an idea of its wealth, from the specimens
of gold produced by the natives, that he resolved
to leave a small colony upon the river Belem,
in the province of Veragua, under the command 1503.
of his brother, and to return himself to Spain,
in order to procure what was requisite for ren-
dering the establishment permanent. But the
ungovernable spirit of the people under his
command, deprived Columbus of the glory of
planting the first colony on the continent of
America. Their insolence and rapaciousness
provoked the natives to take arms, and as there
were a more hardy and warlike race of men
than the inhabitants of the islands, they cut off

Shipwreck- THIS repulse, the first that the Spaniards mnt
ed on the
coast ofa- with from any of the American nations, was
rmaica. not the only misfortune that besel Columbus;

it was followed by a succession of all the difaC.
ters to which navigation is exposed. Furious
hurricanes, with violent storms of thunder and
lightning, threatened his leaky vessels with de-
ftrution; while his discontented crew, exhausted
with fatigue, and destitute of provisions, wa;
unwilling or unable to execute his commands.
One of his ships perished; he was obliged to
abandon another, as unfit for service; and with
the two which remained, he quitted that part
of the continent which in his anguish he named
the Coast of Vexation', and bore away for
Hispaniola. New distresses awaited him in this
voyage. He was driven back by a violent tem-
pest from the coast of Cuba, his flips fell foul
of one another, and were so much shattered by
the shock, that with the utmost difficulty they

The measure of his calamities seemed now to be B o o K

full. He was catl aflore upon an island at a - -.
considerable distance from the only settlement 's503
of the Spaniards in America. His ships were
ruined beyond the polibility of being repaired.
To convey an account of his situation to His-
paniola, appeared impracicable; and without
this it was vain to expect relief. His genius,
fertile in refourccs, and most vigorous in those
perilous extremities when feeble minds abandon
themselves to despair, discovered the only expe-
dient which afforded any prolpcd of deliverance.
He had recourse to the hofpirable kindness of
the natives, who confidering the Spaniards as
beings of a filperior nature, were eager, on
every occasion, to minister to their wants. From
them he obtained two of their canoes, each
formed out of the trunk of a tingle tree hol-
lowed with fire, and so mis-shapen and auk ward
as hardly to merit the name of boats. In these,
which were fit only for creeping along the
coafr, or crofing from one fide of a bay to an-
other, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fiefchi, a Ge-
noelc, two gentlemen particularly attached to
Colunmbus, gallantly ollred to set out for Iif-

1503. panied them funk under it, and died. The at-

tention paid to them by the governor of HitFa-
niola was neither such as their courage merited,
nor the distress of the persons from whom they
came required. Ovando, from a mean jealousy
of Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to set
foot in the island under his government. This
ungenerous pafion hardened his heart againlt
every tender sentiment, which reflection upon
the services and misfortunes of that great man,
or compassion for his own fellow-citizens in-
volved in the fame calamities, must have excited.

without any profpeEt of obtaining it.

deliverance, from the fiuccefs of Mendez and

desponding. After some time the more timo-
rous began to fiuipeEt that they had miscarried
15C4. in their daring attempt. At length, even the

inoft aImguine concluded that they had perifled.
The ray of hope which had broke in upon them,
made their condition appear now more dlifinal.

Despair, heightened by disappointment, fettled B o o K
in every brealt. Their last resource had failed, .
and nothing remained but the profpeEt of end- £504.
ing their miserable days among naked savages,
far from their country and their friends. The
seamen, in a transport of rage, rose in open
mutiny, threatened the life of'Columbus, whom
they reproached as the author of all their cala-
mities, seized ten canoes, which he had pur-
chased from the Indians, and defpifmg hisj e-
monstrances and entreaties, made o'f with theni
to a distant part of the island. At the famne
time the natives murmured at the long residence
of the Spaniards in their country. As their in-
dufRry was not greater than that of their neigh-
bours in Hispaniola, like them they found the
burden of supporting so many firangers to be
altogether intolerable. They began to bring in
provisions with relufance, they furniflied them
with a sparing hand, and threatened to with-
draw those supplies altogether. Such a refo-
lution must have been quickly fatal to the
Spaniards. Their faifty depended upon the
good-will of the Indians; and ulllefs they could

high opinion which the Indians had originally
entertained of them. By his flill in astronomy
he knew that there was fhoitly to be a total
eclipse of the moon. IIe assembled all the prin-
cipal persons of the diftri't around him on the
day before it happened, and, after reproaching
them for their fickleness in withdrawing their
affedtion and assistance from men whom they
had lately revered, he told them, that the Spa-
niards were servants of the Great Spirit who
dwells in heaven, who made and governs the
world; that he, offended at their refusing to
support men who were the objeCts of his pe-
culiar favour, was preparing to punish this crime
with exemplary severity, and that very night
the moon should withhold her light, and appear
of a bloody hue, as a sign of the divine wrath,
and an emblem of the vengeance ready to fall
upon them. To this marvellous prediction

WVHrLE Columbus was employed in his lafl 0 0
o

voyage, several events worthy of notice
happened in Hispaniola. The colony there, the ,5't0

State of the

parent and nurie of all the subsequent eflablifh- colony in
ments of Spain in the New World, gradually
acquired the form of a regular and prosperous
society. The humane solicitude of Isabella to
protea the Indians from oppression, and parti-
cularly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards
were prohibited to compel them to work, re-
tarded, it is true, for Inme time, the progress of
improvement. The natives, who confidercd
exemption fiom toil as supreme felicity, scorned
every allurement and reward by which they
were invited to labour. The Spaniards had not
a lfflicieat number of hands either to work the

mines

B 0 0 K mines or to cultivate the foil. Several of the

2_- firfl colonifis, who had been accuitomed to the
'o04. service of the Indians, quitted the island, when

deprived of those instruments, without which
they knew not how to carry on any operation.
Many of the new settlers who came over with
Ovando, were seized with the distempers pecu-
liar to the climate, and in a short space above a
thousand of them died. At the fame time, the
exacting one half of the product of the mines
as the royal share, was found to be a demand
so exorbitant, that no adventurers would engage
to work them upon such terms. In order to
save the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to
50os. relax the rigour of the royal edias. He made

a new difiribution of the Indians among the
Spaniards, and compelled them to labour, for a
fiated time, in digging the mines, or in culti-
vating the ground; but, in order to screen him-
self from the imputation of having fubjeftcd
them again to servitude, he enjoined their matters
to pay them a certain tuin, as the price of their
work, He reduced the royal flare of the gold
found in the mines from the half to the third
part, and soon after lowered it to a fifth, at
which it long remained. Notwithstanding Ifa-
hclla's tender concern for the good treatment
of the Indians, aind Ferdinand's eagerness to im-

prove

court to approve of both these regulations 3.

oppression, though during a short interval, now
felt the yoke of bondage to be to galling, that
they made several attempts to vindicate their
own liberty. This the Spaniards confidered as
rebellion, and took arms in order to reduce
them to fubjelion. When var is carried on
between nations whose slate of improvement is
in any degree similar, the means of defence bear
foine proportion to those employed in the at-
tack; and in this equal contest such efforts mult
be made, such talents are displayed, and such
paflions roused, as exhibit mankind to view in
a situation no less firiking than interefling. It
is one of the noblest funclions of hiflory, to ob-
fcrve and to delineate men at a juncture when
their minds are moit violently agitated, and all
their powers and paflons are called forth.
Hence the operations of war, and the fIruggles
between contending flates, have been deemed
by hiflorians, ancient as well as modern, a ca-
pital and important article in the annals of
human actions. But in a contef between

505.' norance, timidity, and disorder on the other,

a particular detail of events would be as un-
pleasant as uninfiruaive. If the simplicity and
innocence of the Indians had inspired the Spa-
niards with humanity, had softened the pride
of superiority into compafion, and had induced
them to improve the inhabitants of the New
World, instead of oppressing them, some sudden
ads of violence, like the too rigorous chastise-
ments of impatient inflruators, might have been
related without horror. But, unfortunately,
this consciousness of superiority operated in a
different manner. The Spaniards were ad.
vanced so far beyond the natives of America in
improvement of every kind, that they viewed
them with contempt. They conceived tile
Americans to be animals of an inferior nature,
who were not entitled to the rights and privi-
leges of men. In peace, they fubjefted them
to servitude. In war, they paid no regard to
those laws, which, by a tacit convention between
contending nations, regulate hostility, and set
some bounds to its rage. They confidered
them not as men fighting in defence of their
liberty, but as flavcs, who had revolted againlt
their naficrs. Their caziques, when takc!,
were condemnedl, like the leaders of banditti,

to

to the moll cruel and ignominious punishments; B o o K
and all their subjects, without regarding the _-
diftintion of ranks established among them, '5o5s
were reduced to the fame slate of abjed slavery.
With such a spirit and sentiments were hofitlities
carried on against the cazique of Higuey, a
province at the eastern extremity of the island.
This war was occasioned by the perfidy of the
Spaniards, in violating a treaty which they had
made with the natives, and it was terminated
by hanging up the cazique, who defended his
people with bravery so far superior to that of
his countrymen, as entitled him to a better
fate .

THE conduct of Ovando, in another part The cruet

of the island, was still more treacherous and cia'.u,

c'..nclll et c.

cruel. The province anciently named Xara- o.?,idc.
gua, which extends from the fertile plain where
Leogane is now situated, to the .western ex-
tremity of the island, was fubljed to a female
cazique, named Anacoana, highly rcfpecled by
the natives. She, fiom that partial fondness
with which the women of America were at-
tached to the Europeans, (the cause of which
flall be afterwards explained,) had always courted
the friendship of the Spaniards, and loaded

them

B o o K them with benefits. But some of the adherents

IlI.
,,_. of Roldan having fettled in her country, were

J5C5. so much exasperated at her endeavouring to

refirain their excesses, that they accused her of
having formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and
to exterminate the Spaniards. Ovando, though
he knew well what little credit was due to such
profligate men, marched, without further in.
quiry, towards Xaragua, with three hundred
foot and seventy horsemen. To prevent the
Indians from taking alarm at this hostile appear-
ance, he gave out that his sole intention was to
visit Anacoana, to whom his countrymen had
been so much indebted, in the most refpeEtful
manner, and to regulate with her the mode of
levying the tribute payable to the king of Spain.
Anacoana, in order to receive this illustrious
guest with due honour, aflembled the principal
men in her dominions, to the number of three
hundred, and advancing at the head of thefc,
accompanied by a great crowd of persons of
inferior rank, the welcomed Ovando with songs
and dances, according to the mode of the coun-
try, and conducted him to the place of her
residence. There he was feasted for some days,
with all the kindncfs of finple hospitality, and
ainufed with the games and fpeEtacles usual
among the Americans upon occasions of mirtll

and

and festivity. But, amidst the security which u o o K
this inspired, Ovando was meditating the deftruc- __
tion of his unfufpicious entertainer and her sub- '505S
jedts; and the mean perfidy with which he
executed this scheme, equalled his barbarity in
forming it. Under colour of exhibiting to the
Indians the parade of an European tournament,
he advanced with his troops, in battle array,
towards the house in which Anacoana and the
chiefs who attended her were assembled. The
infantry took possession of all the avenues which
led to the village. The horsemen encompafled
the house. These movements were the objed
of admiration without any mixture of fear,
until, upon a signal which had been concerted,
the Spaniards suddenly drew their swords, and
rushed upon the Indians, defenceless, and afto-
nithed at an adt of treachery which exceeded the
conception of undesigning men. In a moment
Anacoana was secured. All her attendants were
seized and bound. Fire was set to the house
and, without examination or conviction, all these
unhappy persons, the mofl illullrious in their
own country, were consumed in the flames.
Anacoana was reserved for a more ignominious
fate. She was carried in chains to St. Domingo,
and, after the formality of a trial before Spanish
judges, fle was condemned, upon the evidence

any restraint, distributed Indians among his
friends in the island. Ferdinand, to whom the
queen had left by will one half of the revenue
arising from the settlements in the New World,
conferred grants of a similar nature upon his
courtiers, as the least expensive mode of reward-

tiots of their oppressors no longer knew any Bn O K
bounds. But, barbarous as their policy was,
and fatal to the inhabitants of Hispaniola, it '506.
produed, for some time, very considerable effects.
By calling forth the force of a whole nation,
and exerting it in one direction, the working of
the mines was carried on with amazing rapidity
and success. During several years, the gold
brought into the royal finelting-houfes in His-
paniola amounted annually to four hundred and
sixty thousand pesos, above a hundred thousand
pounds sterling; which, if we attend to the
great change in the value of money since the
beginning of the sixteenth century to the present
times, must appear a considerable fum. Vast
fortunes were created, of a sudden, by some.
Others dissipated in ostentatious profusion, what
they acquired with facility. Dazzled by both,
new adventurers crowded to America, with the
mnot eager impatience, to share in those treasures
which had enriched their countrymen; and,
notwithstanding the mortality occasioned by the
unlealthinefs of the climate, the colony conti-
nued to increase d.

of the Spaniards to some branch of industry
more useful than that of Searching for gold in
the mines. Some flips of the sugar-cane having
been brought from the Canary islands by way o!
experiment, they were found to thrive with such
increase in the rich foil and warm climate to
which they were transplanted, that the cultiva-
tion of them soon became an objet of comr
merce. Extensive plantations were begun;
fugar-works, which the Spaniards called ingenio':,
from the various machinery employed in them,
were ereced, and in a few years the manufature

ance of those discoveries, which he had hitherto _
affected to undervalue. Fortune, and his own 1506-
address, having now extricated him out of those
difficulties in which he had been involved by the
death of his queen, and by his disputes with his 1507.
fon-in-law about the government of her domi-
nions f, he had full leisure to turn his attention
to the affairs of Ameiica. To his provident
sagacity, Spain is indebted for many of thoie
regulations which gradually formed that system
of profound, but jealous policy, by which she
governs her dominions in the New World. He
eroded a court, distinguished by the title of the
Cnaa de Contratacion, or Board of Trade, coin-
posed of persons eminent for rank and abilities,
to whom he committed the administration of
American affairs. This board assembled regu-
lurly in Seville, and was invested with a diftiin
and extensive jurifdicion. He gave a regular
form to ecclesiastical government in America,
by nominating archbishops, bishops, deans, toge-
ther with clergymen of subordinate ranks, to
take charge of the Spaniards establishcd there,
as well as of the natives who flould embrace
the Chriiflan faith. But, notwithflanding the

the sole right of patronage to the benefices in
America, and flipulated that no papal bull or

it was previously examined and approved of by
his council. IVith the fame spirit of jealoufv,
he prohibited any goods to be exported to Ame-
rica, or any person to fettle there, without a

Th enirl- BUT, notwithstanding this attention to the
Indian, C.- police and welfare of the colony, a calamity

inmpended which threatened its dissolution. The
original inhabitants, on whose labour the Spa.
niards in Hispaniola depended for their profpe-
rity, and even their exil]ence, wafted so fat,
that the etinAion of the whole race seemed to
be inevitable. When Columbus discovered Hlif

puted to be at least a million h. They were no0
reduced to sixty thousand in the space of fifteen
years. This consumption of the human fpccice.
no lctk amazing than rapid, was the effect of fc\t:
ral concurring causes. The natives of the A\n:

rican islands were of a more feeble conflitution B O 0 K
than the inhabitants of the other hemisphere. -v_
They could neither perform the fame work, nor '°7'
endure the fame fatigue, with men whose organs
were of a more vigorous conformation. The lifti
less indolence in which they delighted to pass their
days, as it was the effea of their debility, con.
tributed likewise to increase it, and rendered
them, from habit as well as conflitution, inca-
pable of hard labour. The food on which they
subsisted afforded little nourishment, and they
were accustomed to take it in finall quantities,
not sufficient to invigorate a languid frame, and
render it equal to the efforts of active industry.
The Spaniards, without attending to those pecu-
liarities in the constitution of the Americans,
imposed talks upon them, which, though not
greater than Europeans might have performed
with ease, were so disproportioned to their
strength, that many funk under the fatigue,
and ended their wretched days. Olhers,

the inflruments which they were accuflomed to
employ, found it impossible to extend their im-
provements, or even to carry on the works
5o8°. which they had already begun. In order to

provide an immediate remedy for an evil so
alarming, Ovando proposed to transport the
inhabitants of the Lucayo islands to Hispaniola,
under pretence that they might be civilized with
more facility, and inflruAed to greater advantage
in the Christian religion, if they were united to
the Spanish colony, and placed under the imme.
diate infpeetion of the missionaries fettled there.
Ferdinand, deceived by this artifice, or willing
to connive at an act of violence which policy
represented as necessary, gave his assent to the
proposal. Several vessels were fitted out for
the Lucayos, the commanders of which infornned
the natives, with whose language they were no"
well acquainted, that they came fiom a delici(lli
country, in which the departed anccltors of t!h
Indians resided, by whom they were lent to
invite their descendants to resort thither, to
partake of the bliss enjoyed there by la'l!
fpii-its. That firnple people liflened with wonder
aind credulity; and, fund of visiting rhcir rc
lations andt fricnds in that happy region, fti'l

lowed the Spaniards with eagerness. By this B 00 K

iAl

artifice, above forty thousand were decoyed into _
Hispaniola, to (hare in the sufferings which were 's08
the lot of the inhabitants of that island, and to
mingle their groans and tears with thole of that
wretched race of men .

THE Spaniards had, for tome time, carried New dif.

on their operations in the mines of Hispaniola cai cf.tt
with such ardour as well as success, that these '"c'nt'
seemed to have engrofled their whole attention.
The spirit of discovery languished; and, since
the lafl voyage of Columbus, no enterprize of
any moment had been undertaken. But as the
decrease of the Indians rendered it iinpoffible to
acquire wealth in that island with the fame ra-
pidity as formerly, this urged some of the more
adventurous Spaniards to search for new coun.
tries, where their avarice might be gratified with
more facility. Juan Ponce de Leon, who com-
manded under Ovando in the eaflern di(trid
of Hispaniola, passed over to the island of St.
Juan de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had
difcovcred in his second voyage, and penetrated
into the interior part of the country. As he
found the foil to be fertile, and expected, from

the mountains, Ovando permitted him to at.

was easily effected by an officer eminent for
conduct no less than for courage. In a few
years Puerto Rico was fubjeded to the Spanish
government, the natives were reduced to fervi.

fiderate rigour as their neighbours in-Hifpaniola,
the race of original inhabitants, worn out with
fatigue and sufferings, was soon exterminatedk.

ABOUT the fame time, Juan Diaz de Solis,

in conjuncion with Vincent Yanez Pinzon, one
of Columbus's original companions, made a
voyage to the continent. They held the fame
course which Columbus had taken, as far as to
the island of Guanaios; but, standing from
thence to the weft, they discovered a new and
extensive province, afterwards known by the
name of Yucatan, and proceeded a considerable
way along the coast of that country '. Though
nothing miemorable occurred in this voyage, it
deserves notice, because it led to discoveries of
greater importance. For the fame reason, the

Ever since the death of Columbus, his son Don Hifpaniila.
Diego had been employed in soliciting Ferdi-
nand to grant him the offices of viceroy and
admiral in the New World, together with all
the other immunities and profits which de.
scended to him by inheritance, in consequence
of the original capitulation with his father. But
if these dignities and revenues appeared to con-
fiderable to Ferdinand, that, at the expence of
being deemed unjust as well as ungrateful, he
had wrefled them from Columbus, it is not
surprising that he ihould be unwilling to confer
them on his son. Accordingly, Don Diego
wafted two years in inceflant but fruitless im-
portunity. Weary of this, he endeavoured at
length to obtain, by a legal sentence, what he
could not procure from the favour of an inte.
rceted monarch. IHe commenced a suit against
Fcrdinand before the council which managed

Diego's claim of the viceroyalty, together with
all the other privileges stipulated in the capi.
tulation. Even after this decree, Ferdinand's
repugnance to put a subjet in pofleffion of such
extensive rights, might have thrown in new
obstacles, if Don Diego had not taken a ftep
which interefled very powerful persons in the
success of his claims. The sentence of the
council of the Indies gave him a title to a rank
so elevated, and a fortune so opulent, that he
found no difficulty in concluding a marriage
with Donna Maria, daughter of Don Ferdinand
de Toledo, great commendator of Leon, and
brother of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of
the first rank, and nearly related to the king.
The duke and his family espouSed so warmly
the cause of their new ally, that Ferdinand could
,509. not refifl their lolicitations. He recalled Ovando,

and appointed Don Diego his fucceflor, though,
even in conferring this favour, he could not
conceal his jealousy; for he allowed him to
afiume only the title of governor, not that of
viceroy, which had been adjudged to belong to
him ".

DON Diego quickly repaired to Hispaniola, B 0 K

attended by his brother, his uncles, his wife,
whom the courtely of the Spaniards honoured '509.

He repairs

with the title of vice-queen, and a numerous tolHirfpa-
retinue of persons of both sexes, born of good ni
families. He lived with a splendour and magni-
ficence hitherto unknown in the New World;
and the family of Columbus fcmed now to
enjoy the honours and rewards due to his in-
ventive genius, of which he himiclf had been
cruelly defrauded. The colony itself acquired
new lustre by the accession of so many inha-
bitants, of a dilferent rank and character from
nmoft of those who had hitherto migrated to
America, and many of the molt illustrious fa-
niilies in the Spanifi fettlemlents are descendcd
from the persons who at that time accompanied
Don Diego Columbus °.

from the king, about fettling a colony in Cuba-

vered in his third voyage. Though this barren
spot hardly yielded subsistence to its wretched
inhabitants, such quantities of those oysters
which produce pearls were found on its coast,
that it did not long escape the inquisitive ava.
rice of the Spaniards, and became a place of
considerable resort. Large fortunes were ac.
quired by the fishery of pearls, which was car-
ried on with extraordinary ardour. The Indians,
especially those from the Lucayo islands, were
compelled to dive for them; and this dangerous
and unhealthy employment was an additional
calamity, which contributed not a little to the
extinction of that devoted race 9.
New ABOUT this period, Juan Diaz de Solis and

Pinzon set out, in conjuntion, upon a second
voyage. -They flood directly south, towards

the equinoctial line, which Pinzon had formerly B 0 0 K
crossed, and advanced as far as the fortieth de- '
gree of southern latitude. They were astonished '509.
to find that the continent of America stretched
on their right hand, through all this vast extent
of ocean. They landed in different places, to
take possession in name of their Sovereign; but
though the country appeared to be extremely
fertile and inviting, their force was ib small,
having been fitted out rather for discovery than
making settlements, that they left no colony
behind them. Their voyage served, however,
to give the Spaniards more exalted and adequate
ideas with refpeEt to the dimensions of this new
quarter of the globe'.

iumbus had discovered the main land of Ame- rilt LoAti-
rica, the Spaniards had hitherto made no fettle- '',mptd.

long neglected was now seriously attempted,
and with considerable vigour, though the plan
for this purpose was neither formed by the
crown, nor executed at the expcnce of the
nation, but carried on by the enterprising spirit
of private adventurers. This Icheme took its
rife from Alonfo de Ojeda, who had already

'509 But his characer for intrepidity and conduct

easily procured him affbciates, who advanced
the money requisite to defray the charges of the
expedition. About the fame time, Diego de
Nicueffa, who had acquired a large fortune in
Hispaniola, formed a similar design. Ferdinand
encouraged both; and though he refused to
advance the finalleft fum, was extremely liberal
of titles and patents. He erected two govern-
ments on the continent, one extending from
Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien, and the
other from that to Cape Gracias a Dios. The
former was given to Ojeda, the latter to Ni-
cueffa. Ojeda fitted out a ship and two bri-
gantines, with three hundred men; Nicueffa,
fix veflels, with seven hundred and eighty men.
They failed about the fame time from St. Do-
mingo for their refpeQive governments. In
order to give their title to those countries tome

nent divines and lawyers in Spain w'ere employed
to prescribe the mode in which they should

them of the grant which this holy pontiffhad
made of their country to the king of Spain; to
require them to embrace the dorrines of that
religion which the Spaniards made known to
them; and to submit to the sovereign whose
authority they proclaimed. If the natives re-
fused to comply with this requisition, the terms
of which munt have been utterly incompre-
henfible to uninflructed Indians, then Ojeda
and Nicuefa were authorised to attack them
with fire and fvord; to reduce them, their
wives and children, to a state of servitude; and
to compel them by force to recognize the jurif-

, conceive how a foreign prie;, of whom they
1509. had never heard, could have any right to dispose

of their country, or how an unknown prince
fllould claim jurifdidcion over them as his sub.
jeas; they fiercely opposed the new invaders
of their territories. Ojeda and Nicueffa en.
deavoured to effet by force what they could
not accompiifli by persuasion. The contem.
porary writers enter into a very minute detail
in relating their transactions; but as they made
no discovery of importance, nor eftablifled any
permanent settlement, their adventures are not
entitled to any considerable place in the general
history of a period, where romantic valour,
struggling with incredible hardships, distinguish
every effort of the Spanifl arms. They found
the natives in those countries of which they
went to assume the government, to be of a
character very different from that of their coun-
trymen in the islands. They were fierce and
warlike. Their arrows were dipped in a poison
so noxious, that every ,wound was followed with
certain death. In one encounter they flew
above seventy of Ojeda's followers, and the
Spaniards, for the first timhe, were taught to
dread the inhabitants of the New World. Ni
cueffa was opposed by people equally resolute
in defence of their poffeflions. Nothing could

fofticl

soften their ferocity. Though the Spaniards B O0 K
employed every art to soothe them, and to gain L-_
their confidence, they refused to hold any inter- 1509'
course, or to exchange any friendly office, with
men whose residence among them they confi.
dered as fatal to their liberty and independence.
This implacable enmity of the natives, though x51o.
it rendered an attempt to establish a settlement
in their country extremely difficult as well as
dangerous, might have been surmounted at
length by the perseverance of the Spaniards,
by the superiority of their arms, and their ikill
in the art of war. But every disaster which can
be accumulated upon the unfortunate, combined
to complete their ruin. The loss of their flips
by various accidents upon an unknown coast,
the diseases peculiar to a climate the moif nox-
ious in all America, the want of provisions,
unavoidable in a country imperfealy cultivated,
dissension among themselves, and the incessant
hostilities of the natives, involved them in a fuc-
ceflion of calamities, the bare recital of which
itrikes one with horror. Though they received
two considerable reinforcements from Hispaniola,
the greater part of those who had engaged in
this unhappy expedition, periflied, in less than a
year, in the most extreme misery. A few who

to the end attained, that there is nothing to

But when large fortunes were created almost in-

among the Spaniards, who rushed with ardour
into this new path that was opened to wealth
and diftintion. While this spirit continued
warm and vigorous, every attempt either towards
dilcovery or conquest was applauded, and ad-
venturers engaged in it with emulation. The
passion for new undertakings, which charaderifes
the age of discovery in the latter part of the
fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth cen,
tury, would alone have been sufficient to pre-
vent the Spaniards from flopping short in their
career. But circumstances peculiar to Hifpa-
niola at this juncture, concurred with it in
extending their navigation and conquests. The
rigorous treatment of the inhabitants of that

A--_-.. _of the Spanif planters, as I have already ob-
,510' served, finding it impossible to carry on their

works with the fame vigour and profit, were
obliged to look out for settlements in some
country where people were not yet wafted by
oppreflion. Others, with the inconsiderate le.
vity natural to men upon whom wealth pours
in with a sudden flow, had squandered in
thoughtless prodigality, what they acquired
with ease, and were driven by necessity to
embark in the most desperate schemes, in order
to retrieve their affairs. From all these causes,
when Don Diego Columbus proposed to con.
quer the island of Cuba, and to establish a co.
lony there, many persons of chief diftinaion in
lifpaniola engaged with alacrity in the measure.
He gave the command of the troops deflined
for that service to Diego Velasquez, one of his
father's companions in his second voyage, and
who, having been long fettled in Hispaniola,
had acquired an ample fortune, with such repu-
tation for probity and prudence, that he seemed
to be well qualified for conducting an expedition
of importance. Three hundred men were
deemed fuficicit for the conquest of an island
of above seven hundred miles in length, and
filled with inhabitants. But they were of the
fame unwarlike charactcr with the people ot

Hispaniola. They were not only intimidated B o o K
by the appearance of their new enemies, but
unprepared to resist them. For though, from 'I'"
the time that the. Spaniards took poffeflion of
the adjacent island, there was reason to. expet
a descent on their territories, none of the small
communities into which Cuba was divided, had
either made any provision for its own defence,
or had formed any concert for their common
safety. The only obftruAion the Spaniards met
with was from Hatuey, a cazique, who had fled
from Hispaniola, and had taken possession of the
eastern extremity of Cuba. He flood upon the
defensive at their first landing, and endeavoured
to drive them back to their ships. His feeble
troops, however, were soon broken and dif-
perfed; and he himself being taken prisoner,
Velasquez, according to the barbarous maxim
of the Spaniards, confidered him as a slave who
had taken arms against his matter, and con-
demned him to the flames. When Hatuey was
fattened to the flake, a Franciscan friar labour-
ing to convert him, promised him immediate
admittance into the joys of heaven, if he would
embrace the Christian faith. " Are there any
"Spaniards," fays he, after some pause, " in
"that region of bliss which you describe?"
" Yes," replied the monk, " but only such as

T3 "are

B 0 0 K " are worthy and good."-" The best of them,"

returned the indignant cazique, " have neither
s5"-* " worth nor goodness; I will not go to a place

" where I may meet with one of that accursed
" race x." This dreadful example of vengeance
struck the people of Cuba with such terror, that
they scarcely gave any opposition to the progress
of their invaders; and Velasquez, without the
loss of a man, annexed this extensive and fertile
island to the Spanish monarchy Y.

D;G(ovcry THE facility with which this important con.

quest was completed, served as an incitement to
other undertakings, Juan Ponce de Leon,
having acquired both fame and wealth by the
reduEion of Puerto Rico, was impatient to en-
iS i. gage in some new enterprise. He fitted out

three ships at his own expence, for a voyage of
discovery, and his reputation soon drew together
a refpetable body of followers. He directed
his course towards the Lucayo islands; and
after touching at several of them, as well as of
the Bahama isles, he flood to the fouth-wefl, and
discovered a country hitherto unknown to the

Spaniards,

Spaniards, which he called Florida, either be- B o o K
cause he fell in with it on Palm Sunday, or on _
account of its gay and beautiful appearance. '5"'
He attempted to land in different places, but
met with such vigorous opposition from the
natives, who were fierce and warlike, as con-
vinced him that an increase of force was requi-
site to effect a settlement. Satisfied with having
opened a communication with a new country,
of whose value and importance he conceived
very sanguine hopes, he returned to Puerto
Rico, through the channel now known by the
name of the Gulf of Florida.

IT was not merely the pafion of searching

for new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon
to undertake this voyage; he was influenced by
one of those visionary ideas, which at that time
often mingled with the spirit of discovery, and
rendered it more active. A tradition prevailed
among the natives of Puerto Rico, that in the
isle of Bimini, one of the Lucayos, there was
a fountain of such wonderful virtue as to renew
the youth, and recal the vigour of every perion
who bathed in its ialutary waters. In hopes of
finding this grand restorative, Ponce de Leon
and his followers ranged through the islands,
searching, with fruitless solicitude and labour,

'' 4 for

B 0 0 K for the fountain, which was the chief objet of
_ _, t/heir expedition. That a tale so fabulous should

5 /gain credit among simple uninftruEed Indians

is not surprising. That it should make any
imprefion upon an enlightened people appears,
in the present age, altogether incredible. The
fa&, however, is certain; and the most authentic
Spanish historians mention this extravagant sally
of their credulous countrymen. The Spaniards,
at that period, were engaged in a career of ac.
tivity which gave a romantic turn to their
imagination, and daily presented to them strange
and marvellous objects. A New World was
opened to their view. They visited islands and
continents, of whose existence mankind in former
ages had no conception. In those delightful
countries nature seemed to assume another
form: every tree and plant and animal was dif-
ferent from those of the ancient hemisphere.
They seemed to be transported into enchanted
ground; and, after the wonders which they had
seen, nothing, in the warmth and novelty of
their admiration, appeared to them so extra-
ordinary as to be beyond belief. If the rapid
succession of new and striking scenes made such
impression even upon the found understanding
of Columbus, that he boasted of having found
the feat of Paradise, it will not appear firange

that

that Ponce de Leon Ihould dream of discovering B 0

the fountain of youth ",

SOON after the expedition to Florida, a dif. Progrcfs of

B BalPoa in

covery of much greater importance was made arien.
in another part of America. Balboa having
been raised to the government of the small
colony at Santa Maria in Darien, by the vo-
luntary suffrage of his associates, was so ex-
tremely desirous to obtain from the crown a
confirmation of their.elecion, that he dispatched
one of his officers to Spain, in order to solicit
a royal commiflion, which might invest him with
a legal title to the supreme command. Con-
fcious, however, that he could not expeEt success
from the patronage of Ferdinand's ministers,
with whom he was unconne&ed, or from nego-
ciating in a court to the arts of which he was
a stranger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity
to which he aspired, and aimed at performing
some signal service that would secure him the
preference to every competitor. Full of this
idea, he made frequent inroads into the adjacent
country, subdued several of the caziques, and

collectcd

B o K collecEed a considerable quantity of gold, which
,-^..^ abounded more in that part of the continent

1J51, than in the islands. In one of those excursions,

the Spaniards contended with such eagerness
about the division of some gold, that they were
at the point of proceeding to aEs of violence
against one another. A young cazique, who
was'prefent, aflonifhed at the high value which
they set upon a thing of which he did not dif-
cern the use, tumbled the gold out of the ba.
lance with indignation; and, turning to the
Spaniards, " Why do you quarrel (fays he)
about such a trifle ? If you are so passionately
fond of gold, as to abandon your own country,
and to disturb the tranquillity of distant nations
for its fake, I will conduc you to a region
where the metal which seems to be the chief
object of your admiration and desire, is so com-
nlon that the meanest utensils are formed of it."
Transported with what they heard, Balboa and
his companions inquired eagerly where this
happy country lay, and how they might arrive
at it. He informed them that at the distance
of fix funs, that is of fix days journey towards
the south, they should discover another ocean,
near to which this wealthy kingdom was situ-
ated; but if they intended to attack that power-
ful state, they must assemble forces far superior

ill

in number and itrength to those with which they B o o K
now appeared a.

1 511.
THIS was the firit information which the Spa- The

fchenies

niards received concerning the great southern wvicii he
ocean, or the opulent and extensive country
known afterwards by the name of Peru. Balboa
had now before him objeEts suited to his bound-
less ambition, and the enterprising ardour of his
genius. He immediately concluded the ocean
which the cazique mentioned, to be that for
which Columbus had searched without success
in this part of America, in hopes of opening a
more direct communication with the East Indies;
and he conjectured that the rich territory which
had been described to him must be part of that
vast and opulent region of the earth. Elated
with the idea of performing what so great a man
had attempted in vain; and eager to accomplish
a discovery which he knew would be no less
acceptable to the king than beneficial to his
country, he was impatient until he could set
out upon this enterprise, in comparison of which
all his former exploits appeared inconsiderable.
But previous arrangement and preparation were
requisite to ensure success. He began with
courting and securing the friendship of the

earnest of his future hopes. By a proper dlif-
tribution of this, they secured the favour of the
governor, and allured volunteers into the service.
A considerable reinforcement from that island
joined him, and he thought himself in a condi-
tion to attempt the discovery.

Difficulty THE isthmus of Darien is not above fixly
of extcut-
ing i1t. miles in breadth.; but this neck of land, which

binds together the continents of North and
South America, is strengthened by a chain of
lofty mountains firetching through its whole
extent, which render it a barrier of solidity fuffi-
cient to resist the impulse of two opposite
oceans. The mountains are covered with
forefis almost inaccessible. The valleys in that
moist climate, where it rains during two thirds
of the year, are marshy, and so frequently over-
flowed, that the inhabitants find it necessary, in
many places, to build their houses upon trees,
in order to be elevated at some distance from the

nothing to mitigate or correEt those natural 's12
disadvantages. To march across this unex-
plored country, with no other guides but Ins
dians, whose fidelity could be little trusted, was,
on all those accounts, the boldest enterprise on
which the Spaniards had hitherto ventured in
the New World. But the intrepidity of Balboa
was such as distinguished him among his coun-
trymen, at a period when every adventurer was 15r3
conspicuous for daring courage. Nor was bra-
very his only merit; he was prudent in conduct,
generous, affable, and possessed of those popular
talents which, in the most desperate undertakings,
inspire confidence and secure attachment. Even
after the junction of the volunteers from His-
paniola, he was able to muster only an hundred
and, ninety men for his expedition. But they
were hardy veterans, inured to the climate of
America, and ready to follow him through every
danger. A thousand Indians attended them to
carry their provisions; and to complete their
warlike array, they took with them several of
those fierce dogs, which were no less formidable
than destructive to their naked enemies.

that

u 0j0 K that the periodical rains began to abate. He
XL~ proceeded by sea, and without any difficulty, to

'5'3' the territories of a cazique whose friendship he

had gained ; but no sooner did he begin to
advance into the interior part of the country,
than he was retarded by every obitacle, which
he had reason to apprehend, from the nature of
the territory, or the disposition of its inhabitants.
Some of the caziques, at his approach, fled to
the mountains with all their people, and carried
off or destroyed whatever could afford subsist-
ence to his troops. Others colleted their sub-
je&s, in order to oppose his progress, and he
quickly perceived what an arduous undertaking
it was, to conduct such a body of men through
hostile nations, across swamps and rivers, and
woods, which had never been passed hut by
straggling Indians. But by sharing in every
hardship with the meanest soldier, by appearing
the foremost to meet every danger, by promising
confidently to his troops the enjoyment of honour
and riches superior to what had been attained by
the molt successful of their countrymen, he
inspircd them with such enthusiastic resolution,
that they followed him without murmuring.
When they had penetrated a good way into the
mountains, a powerful cazique appeared in a

had surmounted so many obstacles, despised the B o o K
opposition of such feeble enemies. They at- _
tacked them with impetuosity, and having dif- 5'13.
perfed them with much ease and great slaughter,
continued their march. Though their guides
had represented the breadth of the ilthmus to be
only a journey of fix days, they had already spent
twenty-five in forcing their way through the
woods and mountains. Many of them were
ready to fink under such uninterrupted fatigue in
that sultry climate, several were taken ill of the
dysentery and other diseases frequent in that
country, and all became impatient to reach the
period of their labours and sufferings. At length
the Indians assured them, that from the top of
the next mountain they should discover the ocean
which was the objeEt of their wishes. When,
with infinite toil, they had climbed up the
greater part of that steep ascent, Balboa com-
manded his men to halt, and advanced alone to
the summit, that he might be the first who
should enjoy a fpeAacle which he had lb long
desired. As soon as he beheld the South Sea
firetching in endless profped below him, he fell
on his knees, and, lifting up his hands to Heaven,
returned thanks to God, who had conduced
him to a discovery so beneficial to his country,
and so honourable to himself. Iis followers,
,bfterving his transports of joy, ruffled forward

name of the king his master, and vowed to
defend it, with these arms, against all his ene-

THAT part of the great Pacific or Southern

ocean, which Balboa firit discovered, still retains
the name of the Gulf of St. Michael, which he
gave to it, and is situated to the east of Panama.
From several of the petty princes, who governed
in the districts adjacent to that gulf, he extorted
provisions and gold by force of arms. Others
sent them to him voluntarily. To these accept-
able presents, some of the caziques added a
considerable quantity of pearls; and he learned
from them, with much fatisfaftion, that pearl
oysters abounded in the sea which he had newly
discovered.

on the coast of the South Sea concurred in in- _
forming him that there was a mighty and opulent 1513'
kingdom situated at a considerable distance
towards the south-east, the inhabitants of which
had tame animals to carry their burdens. In
order to give the Spaniards an idea of these,
they drew upon the land the figure of the Llamas
or sheep, afterwards found in Pcru, which the
Peruvians had taught to perform such services
as they described. As the Llama, in its form,
nearly resembles a camel, a beast of burden
deemed peculiar to Asia, this circumstance, in
conjunction with the difcovcry of the pearls,
another noted production of that country,
tended to confirm the Spaniards in their mistaken

thousand men, in order to attempt the conquest B o o K
of that opulent country, concerning which he -
had received such inviting intelligence. The 'I'4
first account of the discovery of the New World
hardly occasioned greater joy, than the unex-
peEed tidings that a passage was at last found to
the great southern ocean. The communication
with the East Indies, by a course to the weft-
ward of the line of demarcation drawn by the
Pope, seemed now to be certain. The vast
wealth which flowed into Portugal from its set-
tlements and conquests in that country, excited
the envy and called forth the emulation of other
states. Ferdinand hoped now to come in for a
flare in this lucrative commerce, and in his
eagerness to obtain it, was willing to make an
effort beyond what Balboa required. But even
in this exertion, his jealous policy, as well as
the fatal antipathy of Fonseca, now Biflop of
Burgos, to every man of merit who distinguished
himself in the New World, were conspicuous.
Notwithstanding Balboa's recent services, which
marked him out as the molt proper person to
finish that great undertaking which he had be-
gun, Ferdinand was so ungenerous as to over-
look these, and to appoint Pedrarias Davila
governor of Darien. He gave him the com-
mand of fifteen flout vessels, and twelve hun-

exploits they had heaid so much, and of wh;os2
opulence they had formed such high ideas, clad
in a canvas jacket, and wearing coarse hempen
sandals uled only by the meancft peasants, em-
ployed, together with some Indians, in thatching
his own hut with reeds. Even in this fitlpic
garb, which corresponded so ill with the expeit
ations and wifles of his new guess, Balboa

received them with dignity. The fame of his Bo O K
discoveries had drawn so many adventurers from
the islands, that he could now multer four hun- ''.
dred and fifty men. At the head of those
daring veterans, he was more than a match for
the forces which Pcdrarias brought with him.
But though his troops murmured loudly at the
injustice of the king in superseding their com-
mander, and complained that strangers would
now reap the fruits of their toil and success,
Balboa fuibmitted with implicit obedience to the
will of his sovereign, and received Pedrarias
with all the deference due to his character .

NOTWITHSTANDING this moderation, to DT)icnion

which Pedrarias owed the peaceable poffeltion him lnd
of his government, he appointed a judicial in- J;lb;'.
quiry to be made into Balboa's conduct, while
under the command of Nicueffa, and imposed
a considerable fine upon him, on account of the
irregularities of which he had then been guilty.
Balboa felt sensibly the mortification of being
fubjeted to trial and to punifhlnent in a place
where he had so lately occupied the firflt fation.
Pedrarias could not conceal his jealousy of his
superior merit; so that the rcfentment of the
one, and the envy of the other, gave rife to

the rainy season, in that part of the torrid zone
where the clouds pour down such torrents as
are unknown in more temperate climatesk,
The village of Santa Maria was feated in a rich
plain, environed with marshes and woods. The
constitution of Europeans was unable to with.
stand the pestilential influence of such a situation,
in a climate naturally so noxious, and at a
season so peculiarly unhealthy. A violent and
deftrutive malady carried off many of the fol.
diers who accompanied Pedrarias. An extreme
scarcity of provisions augmented this distress,
as it rendered it impoflible to find proper re.
ifeflhient for the sick, or the necessary fufte.
nance for the healthy'. In the space of a
month, above fix hundred persons perished in
the utmost misery. Dejection and delpair spread
through the colony. Many principal persons
solicitcd their difinifion, and were glad to re-
linquifll all their hopes of wealth, in order to

the country, to levy gold among the natives,
and to search for the mines in which it was
produced. Those rapacious adventurers, more
attentive to present gain than to the means of
facilitating their future progress, plundered with-
out distinction wherever they marched. Re-
gardlefs of the alliances which Balboa had made
with several of the caziques, they stripped them
of every thing valuable, and treated them, as
well as their fubjeEts, with the utmost insolence
and cruelty. By their tyranny and exacions,
which Pedrarias, either from want of authority
or of inclination, did not restrain, all the coun-
try from the gulf of Darien to the lake of Nica-
ragua was desolated, and the Spaniards were
inconsiderately deprived of the advantages which
they might have derived from the friendship of
the natives, in extending their conquefls to the
South Sea. Balboa, who iaw with concern that
such ill-judged proceedings retarded the execu-
tion of his favourite scheme, Tent violent remon-

and, by way of compensation to Balboa, ap-
pointed him Adelantado, or Lieutenant-governor
of the countries upon the South Sea, with very
extensive privileges and authority. At the fame

in all his operations, and to consult with hi'l
concerning every measure which he himself pur-

concord was, that Balboa was permitted to make -,-.i
several small incursions into the country. These 1516'
he conducted with such prudence, as added to
the reputation which he had already acquired.
Many adventurers resorted to him, and, with
the countenance and aid of Pedrarias, he began
to prepare for his expedition to the South Sea.
In order to accomplifi this, it was necessary to
build veflels capable of conveying his troops to
those provinces which he purposed to invade.
After surmounting many obtfacles, and enduring 15'7.
a variety of those hard(hips which were the
portion of the conquerors of America, he at
length finished four frnall brigantines. In there,
with three hundred chosen men, a force superior
to that with which Pizarro afterwards under-
took the fame expedition, he was ready to fail
towards Peru, when he received an unexpcctbd
meflage from Pedrarias". As his reconciliation
with Balboa had never been cordial, the progress

15'7 gratify his vengeance, he scrupled not to defeat

an enterprise of the greatest moment to his
country. Under pretexts which were false,
but plausible, he desired Balboa to postpone his
voyage for a short time, and to repair to Acla,
in order that he might have an interview with
him. Balboa, with the unfufpicious confidence
of a man conscious of no crime, instantly obeyed
the summons; but as soon as he entered the
place, he was arrested by order of Pedrarias,
whose impatience to satiate his revenge did not
susser him to languish long in confinement.
Judges were immediately appointed to proceed
to his trial. An accusation of disloyalty to the
king, and of an intention to revolt against the
governor, was preferred against him. Sentence
of death was pronounced; and though the
judges who pased it, seconded by the whole co-
lony, interceded warmly for his pardon, Pedra-

beheld, with atfonifhment and sorrow, the public

the first of January one thousand five hundred

Janeiro, where an extensive commerce is now
carried on. From thence he proceeded to a
spacious bay, which he supposed to be the en-
trance into a strait that communicated with the
Indian ocean; but upon advancing farther, he
found it to be the' mouth of Rio de Plata, one
of the vast rivers by which the southern conti-
nent of America is watered. In endeavouring
to make a descent in this country, De Solis and
several of his crew were slain by the natives,
who, in fight of the ihips, cut their bodies in
pieces, roasted and devoured them. Difcou-
raged with the lo's of their commander, and
terrified at this shocking fpec'acle, the surviving
Spaniards let fail for Europe, without aiming at
any farther dilcovery '. Though this attempt
proved abortive, it was not without benefit.
It turned the attention of ingenious men to this
course of navigation, and prepared the way for a
more fortunate voyage, by which, a few years
polterior to this period, the great design that
Ferdinand had in view was accoinplifhed.

THOUGHI the Spaniards were thus acively B °0 K

employed in extending their discoveries and ,
settlements in America, they still confidered ,s 'tIe
Hispaniola as their principal colony, and the colonyin
feat of government. Don Diego Columbus
wanted neither inclination nor abilities to have
rendered the members of this colony, who were
most immediately under his jurifdiqion, prosper-
ous and happy. But he was circumscribed in
all his operations by the suspicious policy of
Ferdinand, who on every occasion, and under
pretexts the most frivolous, retrenched his pri-
vileges, and encouraged the treasurer, the judges,
and other subordinate officers, to counteract his
measures, and to dispute his authority. The
most valuable prerogative which the governor
poifefled, was that of ldiltribuing Indians among
the Spaniards fettled in the island. The rigor-
ous servitude of those unhappy men having been
but little mitigated by all the regulations in their
favour, the power of parcelling out such ncccf-
iary inilruments of labour at pleasure, fccured
to the governor great influence in the colony.
In order to strip him of this, Ferdinand created
a new office, with the power of distributing the
Iindians, and bellowed it upon Rodrigo Albu-
querque, a relation of Zapata, his confidential
miniifler. Mortified with the iiijuflicc, as well
as indignity, of this invasion upon his rilgts,

B O OK in a point so essential, Don Diego could no

longer remain in a place where his power and
1517. consequence were almost annihilated. 'He re.

paired to Spain with the vain hopes of obtaining
redrefsr. Albuquerque entered upon his office
with all the rapacity of an indigent adventurer,
impatient to amass wealth. He began with
taking the exact number of Indians in the island,
and found that, from sixty thousand, who, in
the year one thousand five hundred and eight,
survived after all their sufferings, they were now
reduced to fourteen thousand. These he threw
into separate divisions or lots, and bellowed
them upon such as were willing to purchase
them at the highest price. By this arbitrary
distribution, several of the natives were removed
from their original habitations, many were taken
from their ancient matiers, and all of them sub-
jeded to heavier burdens, and to more intolerable
labour, in order to reimburse their new proprie.
tors. Those additional calamities completed
the misery, and hastened on the extincion of
this wretched and innocent race of men .

thought

thought themselves aggrieved, but touched the B oo K
hearts of all who retained any sentiments of
humanity. From the time that Ecclesiastics 1517.
were sent as inftrutors into America, they per-
ceived that the rigour with which their country-
men treated the natives, rendered their ministry
altogether fruitless. The missionaries, in con-
formity to the mild spirit of that religion which
they were employed to publish, early remon-
firated against the maxims of the planters with
refpec to the Americans, and condemned the
repartinientos, or d/ifributions, by which they
were given up as slaves to their conquerors, as no
less contrary to natural justice and the precepts
of Christianity, than to found policy. The
Dominicans, to whom the infirucion of the
Americans was originally committed, were most
vehement in testifying against the repartimnientos.
In the year one thousand five hundred and
eleven, Montefino, one of their most eminent
preachers, inveighed against this practice in the
great church at St. Domingo, with all the impe-
tuoihty of popular eloquence. Don Diego Co-
lumbus, the principal officers of the colony, and
all the laymen who had been his hearers, com-
plained of the monk to his superiors; but they,
instead of condemning, applauded his dodiinc,
as equally pious and tealonable. The Francis-
cans, influenced by the 1pirit of opposition and

'517- laity, and to espouse the defence of the rcparti-

mientos. But as they could not with decency
give their avowed approbation to a fyttem of
oppression, so repugnant to the spirit of religion,
they endeavoured to palliate what they could not
justify, and alleged, in excuse for the conduct of
their countrymen, that it was impossible to carry
on any improvement in the colony, unless the
Spaniards possessed such dominion over the
natives, that they could compel them to la-

Contrary THE Dominicans, regardless of such political
decitions and interested considerations, would not relax in
concerning
thiipoilt. any degree the rigour of their sentiments, and

even refused to absolve, or admit to the sacra-
ment, such of their countrymen as continued to
hold the natives in servitude". Both parties
applied to the king for his decision in a matter
of such importance. Ferdinand empowered a
committee of his privy-council, aflifted by some
of the most eminent civilians and divines in
Spain, to hear the deputies sent from I-lifpaniola,
in support of their refpecive opinions. After a

long discussion, the speculative point in contro- B 0 0 K
verfy was determined in favour of the Domini- '---
cans, the Indians were declared to be a free 's'
people, entitled to all the natural rights of men;
but, notwithstanding this decision, the reparti-
mientos were continued upon their ancient foot-
ing w. As this determination admitted the prin-
ciple upon which the Dominicans founded their
opinion, they renewed their efforts to obtain
relief for the Indians with additional boldness
and zeal. At length, in order to quiet the
colony, which was alarmed by their remon-
ftrances and censures, Ferdinand issued a decree
of his privy council, declaring, that after ma-
ture consideration of the Apostolic Bull, and
other titles by which the crown of Castile claimed 's1.
a right to its possessions in the New World, the
servitude of the Indians was warranted both by
the laws of God and of man; that unless they
were fubjeded to the dominion of the Spaniards,
and compelled to reside under their inspection,
it would be impoflible to reclaim them from
idolatry, or to inltruct them in the principles of
the Christian faith; that no farther scruple
ought to be entertained concerning the lawful-
ncfs of the repartimienlos, as the king and
council were willing to take the charge of that

against that practice Y.

THAT his intention of adhering to this decree

might be fully understood, Ferdinand conferred
new grants of Indians upon several of his cour-
tiers z. But in order that he might not seem
altogether inattentive to the rights of humanity,
he published an edic, in which he endeavourcd
to provide for the mild treatment of the Indians
under the yoke to which he subjected them; he
regulated the nature of the work which they
should be required to perform; he prescribed
the mode in which they should be clothed and
fed, and gave directions with refpeft to their
inftrution iu the principles of Chriflianity '.

dered it as vain to waite their own time and a
strength in attempting to communicate the sub- 1'57'
lime truths of religion to men, whose spirits
were broken, and their faculties impaired by op-
preflion. Some of them, in despair, requested
the permilion of their superiors to remove to
the continent, and to pursue the object of their
mifnion among such of the natives as were not
hitherto corrupted by the example of the Spa-
niards, or alienated by their cruelty from the
Christian faith. Such as remained in Hispaniola

ing him with the guilt of having authorised this
impious measure, which had brought misery and
deftruetion upon a numerous and innocent race
of men, whom Providence had placed under his
protection. Ferdinand, whose mind as well as
body was much enfeebled by his distemper, was
greatly alarmed at this charge of impiety, which
at another jundture he would have despised. He
listened with deep compuntion to the discourse
of Las Casas, and promised to take into serious
consideration the means of redrefling the evil of
which he complained. But death prevented him
from executing his resolution. Charles of Auf-
tria, to whom all his crowns devolved, resided
at that time in his paternal dominions in the
Low Countries. Las Casas, with his usual ar-
dour, prepared immediately to set out for
Slanders, in order to occupy the ear of the
young monarch, when cardinal Ximenes, who,
as regent, assumed the reins of government in
Castile, commanded him to desist from the
journey, and engaged to hear his complaints in
person.

'517- petuous mind delighted in schemes bold and

The regu-
lationsof uncommon, he soon fixed upon a plan which
cieneas. astonished the ministers, trained up under the

formal and cautious administration of Ferdinand.
Without regarding either the rights of Don
Diego Columbus, or the regulations established
by the late king, he resolved to fend three
persons to America as superintendents of all
the colonies there, with authority, after exa-
mining all circumitances on the spot, to decide
finally with respect to the point in question.
It was a matter of deliberation and delicacy to
chufe men qualified for such an important
tfation. As all the laymen fettled in America,
or who had been consulted in the administration
of that department, had given their opinion that
the Spaniards could not keep poffefion of their
new settlements, unless they were allowed to
retain their dominion over the Indians, he saw
that he could not rely on their impartiality, and
determined to commit the trust to ecclefiaflics.
As the Dominicans and Franciscans had already
espoused opposite fides in the controversy, he,
from the fame principle of impartiality, excluded
both these fiaternities friom the conmiffion. lle
ponfincd his choice to the monks of St. Jerome,

a small,

a frall, but refpedable order in Spain. With B o o K
the assistance of their general, and in concert
with Las Casas, he soon pitched upon three '5'7.
persons whom he deemed equal to the charge.
To them he joined Zuazo, a private lawyer of
diltinguifhed probity, with unbounded power to
regulate all judicial proceedings in the colonies.
Las Casas was appointed to accompany them,
with the title of protector of the Indians .

who, from their humble condition in life, were
little entitled to possess this high authority, ap-

late king, a measure so wild and dangerous,
that they refused to issue the dispatches necessary
for carrying it into execution. But Xinenes
was not of a temper patiently to brook oppofi-
tion to any of his fcheimcs. IIe sent fir the
refractory ministers, and addrefid them in such
a tone, that in the utmost consternation. they
obeyed his orders'. The Ifupcintendants, with
their afibciate Zuazo, and Las Casas, failed for
St. Domingo. Upon their arrival, the first at
of their authority was to set at liberty all the

B 0 0 K Indians who had been granted to the Spanish
Hl-_j courtiers,- or to any person not residing in

'517' America. This, together with the information

which had been received from Spain concerning
the object of the commission, spread a general
alarm. The colonists concluded that they were
to be deprived at once of the hands with which
they carried on their labour, and that, of con-
sequence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fa-
thers of St. Jerome proceeded with such caution
and prudence, as soon dissipated all their fears.
They discovered, in every tfep of their conduct,
a knowledge of the world, and of affairs,
which is seldom acquired in a cloilter; and
displayed a moderation as well as gentleness still
more rare among persons trained up in the soli-
tude and austerity of a monastic life. Their ears
were open to-information from every quarter,
they compared the diflerent accounts which they
received, and, after a mature consideration of
the whole, they were fully satisfied that the ltate
of the colony rendered it impoflible to adopt the
plan propoled l)y Las Calas, and recommended
by the Cardinal. They plainly perceived that
the Spaniards fettled in America were so few in
number, that they could neither work the mines
which had been opened, nor cultivate the coun-
1 ry; that they depended lor cffecing both, upon
the labour of the natives, and if deprived of it,

from them; that no allurement was so powerful '517.
as to surmount the natural aversion of the In-
dians to any laborious effort, and that nothing
but the authority of a master could compel
them to work; and if they were not kept con-
ftantly under the eye and discipline of a fupe-
rior, lo great was their natural listlessness and
indifference, that they would neither attend to
religious initruCtion, nor observe those rites of
Chriflianity which they had been already taught.
Upon all those accounts, the superintendents
found it necceary to tolerate the repartimientos,
and to susser the Indians to remain under sub-
jeclion to their Spanifl maflers. They used
their utmost endeavours, however, to prevent
the fatal effects of this establishment, and to fe-
cure to the Indians the consolation of the best
treatment compatible with a (late of fcrvitude.
For this purpose, they revived former regu-
lations, they prescribed new ones, they negleced
no circulnftance that tended to mitigate the ri-
gour of the yoke; and by their authority, their
example, and their exhortations, they laboured
to inspire their countrymen with sentiments of
equity and gentleness towards the unhappy
people upon whose induflry they dependcd.

t._-_ courts of juffice, in such a manner as to render

and introduced various regulations which greatly
improved the interior police of the colony. The
fatisfation which his condu&, and that of the
superintendents gave, was now universal among
the Spaniards fettled in the New World, and
all admired the boldness of Ximenes, in having
departed from the ordinary path of business in
forming his plan, as well as his sagacity, in
pitching upon persons, whose wisdom, mode-
ration, and disinterestedness rendered them
worthy of this high trust g.

He regarded their idea of accommodating their
condut to the state of the colony, as the maxim
of an unhallowed timid policy, which tolerated
what waspnjuft, because it was beneficial. He
contended, that the Indians were by nature free,
and, as their protector, he required the super-
intendents not to bereave them of the common
privilege of humanity. They received his most
virulent remonstrances without emotion, but

and were ready to tear him in pieces for insist- ''7'

rage, found it necessary to take fheltcr in a

America were fruitless, he soon set out for
Europe, with a fixed resolution not to abandon
the protection of a people whom he deemed to

by the death of Ximenes, loft a minister, whose

Las Casas observed their growing influence, and
though projectors are usually too sanguine to
conduct their schemes with much dexterity, he
possessed a bulfling indefatigable activity, which
sometimes accomplishes its purposes with greater
success, than the molt exquisite discernment and
address. He courted theFlemifh Minilters with
assiduity. He represented to them the absurdity
of all the maxims hitherto adopted with refpe&
to the government of America, particularly
during the administration of Ferdinand, and
pointed out the defecs of those arrangements
which Ximenes had introduced. The memory
of Ferdinand was odious to the Flemings. The
superior virtue and abilities of Ximenes had
long been the obje& of their envy. They
fondly wished to have a plausible pretext for
condemning the measures, both of the monarch
and of the minifler, and of reflecting some
discredit on their political wisdom. The friends

censuring the scheme of fending fuperintendants 1517
to America. This union of so many interests
and passions was irresistible; and, in consequence
of it, the fathers of St. Jerome, together with
their associate Zuazo, were recalled. Roderigo
de Figueroa, a lawyer of some eminence, was
appointed chief judge of the island, and received
inftruaions, in compliance with the request of
Las Casas, to examine once more, with the
utmost attention, the point in controversy be-
tween him and the people of the colony, with
refpec to the treatment of the natives; and in
the meantime to do every thing in his power to

Casas

B 0 0 K Casas proposed to purchase a sufficient number
,_^- of negroes from the Portuguese settlements on

'7 the coast of Africa, and to transport them to

America, in order that they might be employed
as slaves in wprking the mines and cultivating
the ground. One of the first advantages which
the Portuguese had derived from their discoveries
in Africa, arose from the trade in slaves. Va-
rious circumstances concurred in reviving this
odious commerce, which had been long abo.
lified in Europe, and which is no less repugnant
to the feelings of humanity, than to the principles
of religion. As early as the year one thousand
five hundred and three, a few negro slaves had
been sent into the New World k. In the year
one thousand five hundred and eleven, Ferdinand
permitted the importation of them in greater
numbers'. They were found to be a more
robust and hardy race than the natives of Ame-
rica. They were more capable of enduring
fatigue, more patient under servitude, and the
labour of one negro was computed to be equal
to that of four Indians'". Cardinal Ximenes,
however, when solicited to encourage this conm
merce, peremptorily rejected the proposition,
because he perceived the iniquity of reducing one

race of men to slavery, while he was consulting n 0o K
about the means of restoring liberty to another".
But Las Casas, from the inconsistency natural '15s7
to men who hurry with headlong impetuosity
towards a favourite point, was incapable of
making this diftindion. While he contended
earnestly for the liberty of the people born in one
quarter of the globe, he laboured to enslave the
inhabitants of another region; and in the
warmth of his zeal to save the Americans from
the yoke, pronounced it to be lawful and expe-
dient to impose one frill heavier upon the Afri-
cans. Unfortunately for the latter, Las Cafas's
plan was adopted. Charles granted a patent to
one of his Flemish favourites, containing an ex-
clufive right of importing four thousand negroes
into America. The favourite fold his patent to
some Genoese merchants for twenty-five thou-
sand ducats, and they were the firfl who brought
into a regular form that commerce for slaves
between Africa and America, which has since
been carried on to such an amazing extent °.

no

B O K no great change upon the state of the colony.

11i. v_,-1- Las Casas, whose zeal was no less inventive than
5'18. indefatigable, had recourse to another expedient

for the relief of the Indians. He observed, that
most of the persons who had fettled hitherto in
America, were sailors and soldiers employed in
the discovery or conquest of the country; the
younger sons of noble families, allured by the
profpet of acquiring sudden wealth; or defpe-
rate adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes
forced to abandon their native land. Instead of
such men, who were difrolute, rapacious, and
incapable of that fober persevering industry
which is requisite in forming new colonies, he
proposed to supply the settlements in Hispaniola
and other parts of the New World with a fuffi-
cient number of labourers and husbandmen,
who should be allured by suitable premiums to
remove thither. These, as they were accuf-
tomed to fatigue, would be able to perform
the work, to which the Indians, from the feeble-
ness of their contfitution, were unequal, and
might soon become ufcful and opulent citizens.
But though Hispaniola flood much in need of a
recruit of inhabitants, having been visited at this
time with the finall-pox, which swept off aliloft
all the natives who had survived their long-con-
tinued oppreflion; and though Las Calas had
the countenance of the Flemish ministers, this

fcheime

scheme was defeated by the bishop of Burgos, B o o K
who thwarted all his projeets P. A_

;517.
LAS CASAS now despaired of procuring any Forms the

idea of a

relief for the Indians in those places where the newcolony.
Spaniards were already fettled. The evil was
become so inveterate there, as not to admit of
a cure. But such discoveries were daily making
in the continent, as gave an high idea both of
its extent and populousness. In all those vast
regions there was but one feeble colony planted;
and except a finall spot on the isthmus of Darien,
the natives still occupied the whole country.
This opened a new and more ample field for
the humanity and zeal of Las Casas, who flat-
tered himself that he might prevent a pernicious
fyltem from being introduced there, though he
had failed of success in his attempts to overturn
it, where it was already established. Full of this
idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccupied
couhtry, ftrctching along the fea-coafl from the
gulf of Paria to the weflern frontier of that pro-
vince now known by the name of Santa Martha.
H-e proposed to fettle there with a colony com-
posed of husbandmen, labourers, and eccle-
fiaflics. IHe engaged, in the space of two years,
to civilize ten thousand of the natives, and to

P Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 21.

B o o K inftru& them so thoroughly in the arts of social

_ life, that, from the fruits of their industry, an
1517* annual revenue of fifteen thousand ducats ihould

arise to the king. In ten years he expected that
his improvements would be so far advanced, as
to yield annually sixty thousand ducats. He
stipulated, that no tailor or soldier ihould ever
be permitted to fettle in this district; and that
no Spaniard whatever thould enter it without
his permiflion. He even projected to clothe the
people whom he took along with him in some
diftinguilhing garb, which did not resemble the
Spanilh dress, that they might appear to the
natives to be a different race of men from thore
who had brought so many calamities upon their
country 1. From this scheme, of which I have
traced only the great lines, it is manifest that
Las Casas had formed ideas concerning the
method of treating the Indians, similar to thole
by which the Jesuits afterwards carried on their
great operations in another part of the fame coni
tinent. He Ifppofed that the Europeans, by
availing themielvcs of that ascendant which they
poffefled in consequence of their superior pro.
grefs in science and improvement, might gra.
dually form the minds of the Americans to relifhi
those comforts of which they were deftitutc,

1517.

BUT to the bishop of Burgos and the council Favourably

of the Indies, this projet appeared not only
chimerical, but dangerous in a high degree.
Thev deemed the faculties of the Americans to
be naturally so limited, and their indolence so
excessive, that every attempt to inflrut or to
improve them would be fruitless. They con-
tended, that it would be extremely imprudent
to give the command of a country extending
above a thousand miles along the coast, to a
fanciful presumptuous enthusiast, a flranger to
the affairs of the world, and unacquainted with
the arts of government. Las Casas, far from
being discouraged with a repulse, which he had
reason to expec, had recourse once more to the
:lemifh favourites, who zealously patronized
his scheme, merely because it had been rejeced
by the Spanish minilters. They prevailed with
their matter, who had lately been railed to the
Imperial dignity, to refer the confidcration of
this measure to a fele& number of his privy-
counsellors; and Las Calas having excepted
against the members of the counsel of the
Indies, as partial and interested, they were all
excluded. The decision of men chosen by re-
commendation of the Flemings, was perfectly

himself, though accustomed, at this early period

not promise that decisive vigour of mind which
distinguished his riper years, could not help fuaf

America, flowed from tomen improper motive,
and began to discover an inclination to examinc

ing the charatier of the Americans, and the
Ific so. proper manner of treating them. An oppor-

tage soon occurred. QOuevedo, the bishop of B o K
Darien, who had accompanied Pedrarias to the '-.
continent in the year one thousand five hundred '5'7
and thirteen, happened to land at Barcelona,
where the court then resided. It was quickly
known, that his sentiments concerning the ta-
lents and disposition of the Indians differed from
those of Las Casas; and Charles naturally con-
cluded that by confronting two refpedable
persons, who, during their residence in America,
had full leisure to observe the manners of the
people whom they pretended to describe, he
might be able to discover which of them had
formed his opinion with the greatest discernment
and accuracy.

marked out, by the inferiority of their talents,
for servitude, and whom it would be impossible
to inftrud or improve, unless they were kept
under the continual infpe&tion of a master.
Las Casas, at greater length, and with more
fervour, defended his own fyflem. He rejected
with indignation the idea that any race of men
wvas born to servitude, as irreligious and in-
human. He asserted, that the faculties of the
Americans were not naturally despicable, but
unimproved; that they were capable of receiving
inftruEtion in the principles of religion, as well
as of acquiring the indultry and arts which
would qualify them for the various offices of
social life; that the mildness and timidity of
their nature rendered them so fubmifiive and
docile, that they might be led and formed with
a gentle hand. He profefled, that his intentions
in proposing the scheme now under confidera-
tion were pure and difinterefled; and though,
from the accomplishment of his designs, inefli-
mable benefits would result to the crown of
Caflile, he never had claimed, nor ever would
receive, any recompence on that account.

CHARLES, after hearing both, and consulting B 0 0 K

with his ministers, did not think himself fuffi-
ciently informed to eftablifl any general art 's17.

Indians; but as he had perfect confidence in osp.Oved
the integrity of Las Casas, and as even the 520o.
bishop of Darien admitted his scheme to be of
such importance, that a trial should be made of
its efects, he issued a patent, granting him the
diftrit in Cumana formerly mentioned, with
full power to establish a colony there according
to his own plan'.

LAs CASAS puifled op the preparations for Iisprepa-

his voyage with his usual ardour. But, either executing
from his own inexperience in the conduct of
affairs, or from the secret opposition of the
Spanish nobility, who universally dreaded the
success of an intfitution that might rob them of
the industrious and useful hands which cultivated
their estates, his progress in engaging husband-
men and labourers was extremely flow, and he
could not prevail on more than two hundred to

_> - )gether unequal to any effeaual attempt towards
1517. civilizing its inhabitants, he set fail. The first

place at which he touched was the island of
Puerto Rico. There he received an account of
a new obstacle to the execution of his scheme,
more insuperable than any he had hitherto en,
countered. When he left America in the year
one thousand five hundred and sixteen, the
Spaniards had little intercourse with any part us
the continent, except the countries adjacent to
the gulf of Darien. But as every species of in-
ternal indufhty began to stagnate in lIipaniola,
when, by the rapid decrease of the natives, the
Spaniards were deprived of those hands with
which they had hitherto carried on their ope-
rations, this prompted them to try various ex-
pedients for supplying that loss. Considerable
numbers of negroes were imported; but, on ac-
count of their exorbitant price, many of the
planters could not afford to purchase them. In
order to procure slaves at an easier rate, fomc
of the Spaniards in I-Iifpaniola fitted out vefIels
to cruize along the coast of the continent. In
places where they found themselves inferior in
strength, they traded with the natives, and gave
European toys in exchange for the plates of
gold worn by them as ornaments; but, wherever
they could fulprilf or overpower the Indians,

they

rhey carried them off by force, and fold them as n o o K
ilaves'. In those predatory excursions, such
atrocious acds of violence and cruelty had been 57'
committed, that the Spaniih name was held in
detestation all over the continent. Whenever
any fiiips appeared, the inhabitants either fled
to the woods, or ruihed down to the shore in
arms, to repel those hated disturbers of their
tranquillity. They forced tome parties of the
Spaniaids to retreat with precipitation; they cut
off others; and in the violence of their resent-
ment against the whole nation, they murdered
two Dominican miflionaries, whose zeal had
prompted them to fettle in the province of Cu-
mana". This outrage against peribns revered for
their fandity, excited such indignation among
the people of Hispaniola, who, nonrithflanding
all their licentious and cruel proceedings, were
poffiled with a wonderful zeal for religion, aid
a fuperflitious refpeEt for its iniiifters, that they
determined to inflict exemplary punifhnment, not
only upon the perpetrators of that crime, but'
upon the whole race. WilJi tlis view, they
gave the command of five flips and three hun-
dred men to Diego (Ocampo, with orders to lay
waste the country of Cumana with fire and
lword, and to tranfiport all the inhabitants as

many concurring causes, the reception which
Las Casas met with in Hispaniola was very unfa-
vourable. In his negociations for the relief of
the Indians, he had censured the conduct of his
countrymen fettled there with such honest feve-
rity as rendered him universally odious to them.
They confidered their own ruin as the inevitable
consequence of his success. They were now

tion of their own adions. But that people,
accuflomed to a mode of life extremely different
from. that which takes place wherever civilization
has made any considerable progress, were inca-
pable of assuming new habits at once. Dejfeded
with their own misfortunes as well as those of
their country, they exerted so little industry in
cultivating the ground, appeared so devoid of
solicitude or foresight in providing for their own
wants, and were such strangers to arrangement
in conducting their affairs, that the Spaniards
pronounced them incapable of being formed to
live like men in social life, and confidered them
as children, who should be kept under the per-
petual tutelage of persons superior to themselves
in wisdom and sagacity Y.

1517' that the diseases of the climate had been fatal to

several of his people; and that others, having
got employment in that island, refused to follow
him. With the handful that remained, he set
fail and landed in Cumana. Ocampo had exe-
cuted his comnmiiion in that province with
such barbarous rage, having massacred many of
the inhabitants, sent others in chains to His-
paniola, and forced the reft to Ily for ihelter to
the woods, that the people of a finall colony,
which he had planted at a place which he named
Toledo, were ready to perish for want in a defo-
lated country. There, however, Las Casas was
obliged to fix his residence, though deserted both
by the troops appointed to proteEt him, and by
those under the command of Ocampo, who
foresaw and dreaded the calamities to which he
must be exposed in that wretched fation. He
made the best provision in his power for the
safety and subsistence of his followers; but as
his utmost efforts availed little towards securing
either the one or the other, he returned to IIift
paniola, in order to solicit more effecual aid for
the preservation of men who, from confidence
in him, had ventured into a post of so much
danger. Soon after his departure, the natives,
having discovered the feeble and defenceless slate

of

of the Spaniards, assembled secretly, attacked B o o i
them with the fury natural to men exasperated _ _
by many injuries, cut off a good number, and 5'7'
compelled the reft to fly in the utmost confter-
nation to the island of Cubagua. The small
colony fettled there, on account of the pearl
fishery, catching the panic with which their
countrymen had been seized, abandoned the
island, and not a Spaniard remained in any part
of the continent, or adjacent islands, from the
gulf of Paria to the borders of Darien. Afto.
nifhed at such a succession of dilaftcrs, Las
Casas was ashamed to fliew his face after this
fatal termination of all his splendid schemes.
He shut himself up in the convent of the Domi-
nicans at St. Domingo, and soon after assumed
the habit of that order Z.

towards the year one thousand five hundred and eleven,
tie witL. fill retained the government of that island, as

the deputy of Don Diego Columbus, though he
seldom acknowledged his superior, and aimed at
rendering his own authority altogether indepen-
dent b. Under his prudent administration, Cuba
became one of the mofr flourifliing of the Spanish
settlements. The fame of this allured thither
many perlbns from the other colonies, in hopes
of finding either some permanent establishment
or some employment for their activity. As
Cuba lay to the weft of all the islands occupied
by the Spaniards, and as the ocean, which
firetches beyond it towards that quarter, had
not hitherto been explored, these circumltances
naturally invited the inhabitants to attempt new

discoveries. An expedition for this purpose, in B 0 0 K
which aEtivity and resolution might conduct to y
sudden wealth, was more suited to the genius ,5'7'
of the age, than the patient industry requisite in
clearing ground, and manufacturing sugar.
Instigated by this spirit, several officers, who
had served under Pedrarias in Darien, entered
into an association to undertake a voyage of
discovery. They persuaded Francisco Hernan-
dez Cordova, an opulent planter in Cuba, and a
man of distinguished courage, to join with them
in the adventure, and chose him to be their
commander. Velasquez not only approved of
the design, but assisted in carrying it on. As
the veterans from Darien were extremely indi-
gent, he and Cordova advanced money for pur-
chafing three small vessels, and furnishing them
with every thing requisite either for traffic or
for war. A hundred and ten men embarked on
board of them, and failed from St. Jago de
Cuba on the eighth of February one thousand
five hundred and seventeen. By the advice of
their chief pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had
served under the first admiral Columbus, they
stood directly weft, relying on the opinion of
that great navigator, who uniformly maintained
that a westerly course would lead to the molt
important discoveries.

ON

B o o K ON the twenty-firft day after their departure

IlL.

_ _- from St. Jago, they saw land, which proved to
151'7 be Cape Catoche, the eastern point of that large

peninsula projeting from the continent of Ame-
rica, which till retains its original name of
Yucatan. Yiucatan. As they approached the shore, five

canoes came off full of people decently clad in
cotton garments; an astonishing fpetacle to the
Spaniards, who had found every other part of
America possessed by naked savages. Cordova
endeavoured by Ihmall presents to gain the good-
will of these people. They, though amazed at
the strange objets now presented for the first
time to their view, invited the Spaniards to visit
their habitations, with an appearance of cor-
diality. They landed accordingly, and as they
advanced into the country, they observed with
new wonder foine large houses built with stone.
But they soon found that, if the people of Yu-
catan had made progress in improvement be-
yond their countrymen, they were likewise more
artful and warlike. For though the cazique
reccived Cordova with many tokens of friend-
Ihip, he had polled a considerable body of his
lubjedts in ambush behind a thicket, who, upon
a signal given by him, rushed out and attacked
the Spaniards with great boldness, and Ibme
degree of martial order. At the first flight of
their arrows, fifteen of the Spaniards were

wounded;

wounded; but the Indians were firuck with B O O K
such terror by the sudden explosion of the fire- -.
arms, and so surprised at the execution done by 151'7
them, by the cross-bows, and by the other
weapons of their new enemies, that they fled
precipitately. Cordova quitted a country where
he had met with such a fierce reception, car-
rying off two prisoners, together with the orna-
ments of a small temple, which he plundered in
his retreat.

HE continued his course towards the weft,

without losing fight of the coast, and on the
sixteenth day arrived at Campeachy. There Campeachy.
the natives received them more hospitably; but
the Spaniards were much surprised, that on all
the extensive coast along which they had failed,
and which they imagined to be a large island,
they had not observed any riverc. As their
water began to fail, they advanced, in hopes of
finding a supply; and at length they discovered
the mouth of a river at Potonchan, some leagues
beyond Campeachy.

15'7' the Spaniards were killed upon the spot, and

one man only of the whole body escaped un-
hurt. Their commander, though wounded in
twelve different places, direted the retreat ,itl
presence of mind equal to the courage with
which he had led them on in the engagement,
and with much difficulty they regained their
ships. After this fatal repulse, nothing remained
but to haften back to Cuba with their shattered
forces. In their passage thither they suffered
the most exquisite distress for want of water,
that men' wounded and sickly, fllut up in small
velfels, and exposed to the heat of the torrid
zone, can be supposed to endure. Some of
them, finking under these calamities, died by
the way; Cordova, their commander, expired
soon after they landed in Cuba d.

from Cuba, fertile in appearance, and possessed -.-
by a people far superior in improvement to any 5'7'
hitherto known in America. Though they had
carried on little commercial intercourse with the
natives, they had brought off tome ornaments
of gold, not considerable in value, but of fin-
gular fabric. These circumstances, related with
the exaggeration natural to men desirous of
heightening the merit of their own exploits,
were more than sufficient to excite romantic
hopes and expectations. Great numbers offered
to engage in a new expedition. Velasquez, so-
licitous to distinguish himself by some service so
meritorious as might entitle him to claim the
government of Cuba independent of the ad-
miral, not only encouraged their ardour, but at
his own expence fitted out four flips for the
voyage. Two hundred and forty volunteers,
among whom were several persons of rank and
fortune, embarked in this enterprise. The com-
mand of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a
young man of known merit and courage, with
initrudtions to observe attentively the nature of
the countries which he fmould discover, to barter
for gold, and, if circuinftanccs were inviting,
to fettle a colony in fomc proper fiation. He I5si.

to the east of Yucatan. As all the inhabitants
fled to the woods and mountains at the approach
of the Spaniards, they made no long flay there,
and without any remarkable occurrence they
reached Potonchan on the opposite fide of the
peninsula. The desire of avenging their coun-
trymen who had been slain there, concurred
with their ideas of good policy, in prompting
them to land, that they might chastise the
Indians of that diltrist with such exemplary
rigour, as would strike terror into all the people
around them. But though they disembarked
all their troops, and carried ashore some field
pieces, the Indians fought with such courage,
that the Spaniards gained the victory with diffi-
culty, and wvere confirmed in their opinion thai
the inhabitants of this country would prove
more formidable enemies than any they had
met with in other parts of America. From
Potonchan, they continued their voyage towards
the weft, keeping as near as possible to the
filore, and calling anchor every evening, from
dread of the dangerous accidents to which they
might be exposed in an unknown lea. During
the day, their eyes were turned continually to.

wonder at the beauty of the country, as well ,_ _
as the novelty of the objec's which they beheld. 'siS.
Many villages were scattered along the coast,
in which they could distinguish houses of itone <
that appeared white and lofty at a distance. In
the warmth of their admiration, they fancied
these to be cities adorned with towers and pin-
nacles; and one of the soldiers happening to
remark that this country resembled Spain in
its appearance, Grijalva, with universal applause,
called it New Spain, the name which flill diftin-
guilhes this extensive and opulent province of
the Spanish empire in America . They landed l.;e (.
in a river which the natives called Tabasco, and
the fame of their victorv at Potonchan having
reached this place, the cazique not only received
them amicably, but bestowed presents upon
them of such value, as confirmed the high
ideas which the Spaniards had formed with rc-
j]ea to the wealth and fertility of the country.
These ideas were raised flill higher by what oc-
curred at the place where they next touched.
This was confidcrably to the weft of Tabasco,
in the province since known by the name of
Guaxaca. There they were received with the (;Cx.i.

were extremely fond of trading with their new
visitants, and in fix days the Spaniards obtained
ornaments of gold, of curious workmanship, to
the value of fifteen thousand pesos, in exchange
for European toys of small price. The two
prisoners whom Cordova had brought from Yu-
catan, had hitherto served as interpreters; but
as they did not understand the language of this
country, the Spaniards learned from the natives
by signs, that they were fubjeAs of a great mo-
narch called Montezuma, whose dominion ex-
tended over that and many other provinces.
Leaving this place, with which he had so much
reason to be pleased, Grijalva continued his
jine 9: course towards the weft. He landed on a small

island, which he named the Isle of Sacrifices,
because there the Spaniards beheld, for the first
time, the horrid fpeEtacle of human viEtims,
which the barbarous superstition of the natives
offered to their gods. He touched at another
si. jan .c frmall island, which he called St. Juan de Ulua.

From this place he dispatched Pedro de Alva-
rado, one of his officers, to Velasquez, with a
full account of the important discoverics which
he had made, and with all the treasure that he
had acquired by trafficking with the natives.

another ex- cefsful voyage which the Spaniards had hitherto

that Yucatan was not an island as they had sup-
posed, but part of the great continent of Ame-
rica. From Potonchan they had pursued their
course for many hundred miles along a coast
formerly unexplored, stretching at first towards
the weft, and then turning to the north; all the
country which they had discovered appeared to
be no less valuable than extensive. As soon as
Alvarado reached Cuba, Velasquez, tranfportedl
with success so far beyond his most sanguine
cxpectations, immediately dispatched a person of
confidence to carry this important intelligence to
Spain, to exhibit the rich produaions of the

countries which had been discovered by his B o0 K

ing for the return of his messenger, or for the
arrival of Grijalva, of whom he was become so
jealous or distrustful that he was resolved no
longer to employ him, he began to prepare
Iuch a powerful armament, as might prove
equal to an enterprise of so much danger and
importance.

was now intent, terminated in conquelrs ot
greater moment than what the Spaniards had
hitherto atchieved, and led them to the know-
ledge of a people, who, if compared with thofc
tribes of America with whom they were hitherto
acquainted, may be confidered as highly civi-
lifed; it is proper to pause before we proceed
to the history of events extremely different from
those which we have already related, in order to
take a view of the Itate of the New World
when first discovered, and to contemplate the
policy and manners of the rude uncultivated
tribes that occupied all the parts of it with which
the Spaniards \\ ere at this time acquainted.

by antiquity. The learned and indufrrious Mr. Dod-
well, in a difrertation prefixed to the Periplus of
fIanno, in the edition of the Minor Geographers pub-
liimed at Oxford, endeavours to prove that this iS ;i
spurious work, the composition of sone Greek, who
assumed Hanno's name. But M. de Montesquieu, in
his l'Efprit des Loix, lib. xxi. c. 8. and M. de Bou-
gainville, in a dissertation publiflied, tom. xxvi. of the
Memoires de l'Academic des Inscriptions, &c. have
cftablifled its authenticity by arguments which to mc
appear unanswerable. Ramufio has accompanied lhis
translation of this curious voyage with a dilrertation
tending to illustrate it. Racolte de Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 12. M. de Bougainville has, with great learning
and ability, treated the fame subjeC. It appears that
Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation,
undertook this voyage in small vefiels, so conflruted,
that he could keep close in with the coast. He failed
from Gadcs to the illand of Cerne in twelve days.
This is probably what is known to the moderns by the
name of the isle of Arguim. It became the chief fta-
tion of the Carthaginians on that coalt; and M. dc
Bougainville contends, that the cilferns found there
are monuments of the Carthaginian power and inge-
nuity. Proceeding from Cernc, and itill following the
winding of the coast, he arrived, in feventcen days, at
a promontory which lie called The 1Wf l-Horn, pro'bably
Capce Palmas. From this lie advanced to another pro-
molntory, which hle named Tie South I-rLn, and which
is maiifeilu y Cape de Tres Puntas, about five degrees
north of the line. All the circumliances contained in
the llhort abftra&t of his journal, which is handed

dowiu

down to us, concerning the appearance and ftatc of the
countries on the coait of Africa, are confirmed anlm
illustrated by a comparison with the accounts of mo-
dern navigators. Even those circumfiances which,
from their seeming improbability, have been produced
to invalidate the credibility of his relation, tend (to
confirm it. He observes, that in the country to the
south of Cerne, a profound silence reigned through
the day ; but during the night innumerable fires were.
kindled along the'banks of the rivers, and the ail-
resounded with tle noise of pipes and drums, and cries
of joy. The fame tiling, as Ramufio obfcrves, ftil!
takes place. The exceltive heat obliges the negroes to
take shelter in the woods, or in their houses, during
the day. As soon as the fun sets, they sally out, and
by torch-light enjoy the plealure of music and dancing,
in which they spend the night. Ramus. i. 1 13. F. 1I

LoNG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of

Eudoxu:- round Africa, Polybius, the most intelligent
and belt informed historian of antiquity, and particu-
larly diflinguiflhed by his attention to geographical
reiearlches, affirms, that it was not known, in his time,
whether Africa was a continued continent, flretching
to the south, or whether it was encompassed by the
sea. Polybii Hist. lib. iii. Pliny the naturalist asserts,

A r:lcr, recorded by Strabo, afFords a very iro:n

and fligular proof of the ignorance of the ancients
with respeCt to the situation of the various parts of the
earth. When Alexander marched along the banks of
the -Hydafpcs and Accfi:lc, t o of the rivers which fall
into the Indus, lie observcd that there were many cro-
codiles in those rivers, and that tlhe country produced
beans of the famc fpecics with thofc which were com-
mon in Egypt. From these circumstances, he con-
cluded that he had difeovered the source of the Nile,
and prepared a fleet to fail down the Hyd..fpes to
Egypt. Strab. Gcogr. lib. xv. p. 1020. This am:a-
7ing error did not arise from any ignorance of geo-
graphy peculiar to tlat monarch; for we are informed
by Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular
attention in order to acquire the knowledge of this
fciencc, and had accurate maps or descriptions of the
countries through which lie marched. Lib. ii. p. I 1o.

tion of that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy
places that branch of the Ganges which he diftin-
guifhcs by the name of the Great Mouth, in the hun-
dred and forty-fixth degree of longitude from his firit
meridian in the Fortunate Islands. But its true longi-
tude, computed from that meridian, is now deter-
mined, by ailronomical observations, to be only a hun-
dred and five degrees. A geographer so eminent mull
have been betrayed into an error of tils magnitude by
the imperfcction of the information which he liad
received concerning thole difCant regions; and this
affords a striking proof of the intercourse with them
being extremely rare. With refpele to the countries
of India beyond the Ganges, his intelligence was
P.ill more defcQtive, and his errors more enormous.
I {hall have occasion to observe, in another place, that
he has placed the country of the Seres, or China, no
less than sixty degrees farther east than its true pofi-
tion. M. d'Anvillc, one of the most learned and
intelligent of the modern geographers, has set tlis
matter in a clear light, in two diflcrtations publifhled

IT is remarkable, that the discoveries of the ancients

'rere made chiefly by land; those of the moderns are
carried on chiefly by sea. The progress of conquest
led to the former, that of commerce to the latter. It
is a judicious observation of Strabo, that the conqucfts
of Alexander the Great made known the East, those of
the Romans opened the Weft, and those of Mithridates
king of Pontus the North. Lib. i. p. 26. When
discovery is carried on by land alone, its progress must
be flow, and its operations confined. When it is
carried on only by sea, its sphere may be more extensive,
and its advances more rapid; but it labours under
peculiar defeets. Though it may make known the
position of different countries, and ascertain their
boundaries as far as these are determined by the ocean,
it leaves us in ignorance with refpeE to their interior
ifate. Above two centuries and a half have elapsed
since the Europeans failed round the southern pro-
montory of Africa, and have traded in most of its
ports; but, in a considerable part of that great con.
tinent, they have done little more than furvcy its coasts,
and mark its capes and harbours. Its interior regions
are in a great measure unknown, The ancients, who
had a very imperfect knowledge of its coasts, except
where they are waflhed by the Mediterranean or Red
Sea, were accustomed to penetrate into its inland pros
vinces, and, if we may rely on the testimony of
lHerodotus and Diodorus Siculus, had explored many
parts of it now altogether unknown. Unlcls both

'iTHE notion of the ancients concerning such an

exceflve degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rendered
it uninhabitable, and their persisting in this error long
after they began to have some commercial intercourfi
w-ith several parts of India lying within the tropics,
must appear so singular and absurd, that it may not
be unacceptable to some of my readers to produce
evidence of their holding this opinion, and to account
for the apparent inconsistence of their theory with
their experience. Cicero, who had bestowed attention
upon every part of philosophy known to the ancients,
seems to have believed that the torrid zone was
uninhabitable, and, of consequence, that there could
be no intcrcourfe between the northern and foithern
temperate zones. He introduces Africanus thus
addirelffng the yonnger Scipio: " You fee this earth
enlcomn!piflc' and ;:s it were bound in by certain zones,
of which two, at the greatest distance from each
otrler, :n(d itfl:tining the opposite poles of heaven, ar.
trozen with perpttual cold ; the middle one, and the
I;irgefl. of all, is burnt with the heat of the fun; two

antilpodcs to us, with whom we have no connextion."

a treatise purely scientific. " When we speak," fays
he, " of the southern temperate zone, and its inhabit-
ants, and concerning those who are called antipodes,
it must be always underifood, that we have no certain
knowledge or information conccrning the southern
temperate zone, whether it be inhabited or not. But
from the spherical figure of the earth, and the course
which the fun holds between the tropics, we conclude
that there is another zone situated to the south, which
enjoys the fame degree of temperature with the northern
one which we inhabit." Cap. xiii. p. 31. ap. Petavii

'The opinion of Pliny the naturalist, with refpe& to
both these points, was the fame: " There are five
divisions of the earth, which are called zones. 'All
that portion which lies near to the two opposite poles
is oppressed with vehement cold and eternal frost.
There, unblest with the aspec of milder stars, perpetual
darkness reigns, or at the utmost a feeble light reflccted
from surrounding snows. The middle of the earth, in
which is the orbit of the fun, is scorched and burnt up
with flames and fiery vapour. Between thcei torrid
an(l frozen ldifrics lic two other portions of the earth,
which are temperate ; but, on account of the burning
region interposed, there can be no communicatiol
between them. Thus Ilcaven has deprived us of three
parts of the earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers
his opinion to the fame cflcfl, in terms no lc s explicit:
"The portion of the earth which lies near the equator,
in the torrid v7nc, is renderedt unillnabita)ble by heat."
Lib. ii. p. 15.l. To thefl I might addt the ,utllorlity

A A 2 of

of many other refpeetable philosophers and hiftorlins
of antiquity.

IN order to explain the sense in which this doctrine

was generally received, we may observe, that
Parmenides, as we are informed by Strabo, was the
firfL who divided the earth into five zones, and lhe
extended the limits of the zone which he supposed
to be unilnha-bitable on account of heat, beyond the
tropics. Aristotle, as we learn likewise from Strabo,
fixed the boundaries of the different zones in the fame
manner as they are defined by modern geographers.
But the progrcis of discovery having gradually
demonfiratcd that several regions of the earth which
lay within the tropics were not only habitable, but
populous and fertile, this induced later geographers
to circumscribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is
not cafy to ascertain with precision the boundaries
which they allotted to it. From a passage in Strabo,
who, as far as I know, is the only author of antiqiu;:,
from whom we receive any hint concerning this
subjec, I lhould conj'eture, that those who calculated
according to the measurement of the earth by
Er:tofthcnes, futppofed the torrid zone to comprehend
near fixtccir degrees, about eight on each fide of the
equator; whereas such as followed the computation ol
Pofi(onius allotted about twenty-four degrees, nr
fomcwhat more than twelve degrees on eacht fi!e (t
the equator the torrid zone. Strabo, lib. ii. p. i r.
According to the former opinion, about two-third:; sul
tlhat portion of the earth which lies between the tropi,
was confidered as habitable; according to tlle l;itt(,

about one half of it. With this reftrition, the doctrine
of the ancients concerning the torrid zone appears less
absurd; and we can conceive the reason of their
asserting this zone to be uninhabitable, even after they
had opened a communication with several places within
the tropics. When men of science spoke of the torrid
zone, they confidered it as it was limited by the
definition of geographers to sixteen, or at the utmost to
twenty-four degrees ; and as they knew almoff nothing
of the countries nearer to the equator, they might still
suppose them to be uninhabitable. In loose and
popular discourse, the name of the torrid zone con-
tinued to be given to all that portion of the earth
which lies within the tropics. Cicero seems to have
been unacquainted with those ideas of the later geo-
graphers, and adhering to the division of Parmenides,
describes the torrid zone as the largest of the five.
Some of the ancients rejeEed the notion concerning
the intolerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular
error. This, we are told by Plutarch, was the tenti-
ment of Pythagoras, and we learn from .Strabo, that
Eratosthenes and Polybius had adopted the fame
opinion, lib. ii. p. 154. Ptolemy seems to have pa'id
no regard to the ancient doctrine and opinions con-
cerning the torrid zone.

Portugal dispatched ambaffldors to Edward IV., in
order to lay before him the right which he had
acquired by the Pope's bull to the dominion of that

THE spherical figure of the earth was known to the

ancient geographers. They invented the method,
flill in use, of computing the longitude and latitude of
different places. According to their doftrine, the
equator, or imaginary line which encompafnes the
earth, contained three hundred and sixty degrees;
these they divided into twenty-four parts, or hours,
each equal to fifteen degrees. The country of the
Serns, or SiA, being the farthest part of India known to
the ancients, was supposcd, by Marinus Tyrius, the
most eminent of the ancient geographers before
Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or two hundred aud
twenty-five degrees to the east of the flir- meridian,
passing through the Fortunate Islands. Ptolemni
Geogr. lib. i. c. 11. If this supposition was well-
founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was only
nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees
weft from the Fortunate or Canary Illands; and the
navigation, in that diretion, was much ihorter tlan
by the course which the Portuguese were pursuing.
Marco Polo, in his travels, had defcribc( countries,
particularly the island of Cipango or Zipangri,
supposed to be Japan, considerably to the cafl of
any part of Asia known to the ancients. Marcus
Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii. c. ,o. lib. iii . c2.
Of course, this country, as it extended further to the
cast, was still nearer to the Canary I ll;nds. The
conclusions of Columbus, though drawn from inac-
curate ohfervations, were just. If the suppositions of
Marinus had been well founded, and if the counlries,

A^ \ 4 whichl

which Marco Polo visited, had been situated to tho
east of those whose longitude Marinus had afccrtained,
the proper and nearest course to the East Indies muit
have been to freer direclly weft. Herrera, dec. i.
lib. i. c. 2. A more extensive knowledge of the globe
has now discovered the great error of Marinus, in sup-
posing China to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and
twenty-five degrees east from the Canary Islands, and
that even Ptolemy was miftalken, when he reduced the
longitude of China to twelve hours, or one hundred
and eighty degrees. The longitude of the western
frontier of that vast empire is seven hours, or one
hundred and fifteen degrees from the meridian of the
Canary Islands. But Columbus followed the light
which his age afforded, and relied upon the authority
of writers, who were, at that time, regarded as the in-
itrutors and guides of mankind in the science of
geography.

As the Portuguese, in making their discoveries, did

pot depart far from the coast of Africa, they concluded
that birds, whose flight they obferyed with great
attention, did not venture tp any considerable diftancc
from land. In the infancy of navigation, it was nor
known, that birds often stretched their flight to an
immense distance from any flore. In failing towards
the 'Weft-Indian islands, birds are often seen at the
diftancc of two hundred leagtues frorr the nearest coalt.

which it appears, that this indication of land, on
which Columbus seems to have relied with some con-
fidence, was extremely uncertain. This observation
is confirmed by Capt. Cook, the most extensive and
experienced navigator of any age or nation. " No
one yet knows (fays he) to what distance any of the
oceanic birds go to fa ; for my own part, I do not
believe that there is one in the whole tribe that can be

IN a letter of the admiral's to Ferdinand and Isabella,

he describes one of the harbours in Cuba, with all the
enthusiastic admiration of a discoverer.-" I discovered
a river which a galley might easily enter: the beauty
of it induced me to found, and I found from five to
eight fathoms of water. Having proceeded a con-
fiderable way up the river, every thing invited me to
fettle there. The beauty of the river, the clearness of
the water, through which I could fee the sandy bottom,
the multitude of palm-trees of different kinds, the
tallest and finelt I had fcen, and an infinite number of
pther large and flourishing trees, the birds, and the
verdure of the plains are so wonderfully beautiful, that
this country excels all others as far as the day furpafies
the night in brightness and splendour, so that I often
said, that it would be in vain for me to attempt to
give your highneffcs a full account of it, for neither
fly tongue nor my pen could come up to the truth;

and

and indeed I am so much amazed at the fight of such
beauty, that I know not how to describe it." Life of
Columb. c. 30.

NOTE XV. p. 141.

THE account which Columbus gives of the humanity

and orderly behaviour of the natives on this occasion
is very ft-iking. " The king (fays he, in a letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella) having been informed of our
misfortune, expreiTcd great grief for our loss, and
immediately sent aboard all the people in the place in
many large canoes; we soon unloaded the fllip of
every thing that was uponl deck, as the king gave us
great assistance: he himself, with his brothers and
relations, took all possible care that every thing flould
be properly done, both aboard and on flore. And,
from time to time, he sent some of his relations weep-
ing, to beg of me not to be dejeced, for he would
give me all that he had. I can assure your highneffcs,
that so much care would not have been taken in
securing our effcas in any part of Spain, as all our
property was put together in one place near his palace,
until the houses which he wanted to prepare for
the cultody of it, were emptied. He immediately
placed a guard of armed meii, whio watched during
the whlolc night, ;and those on imore lamented as if
they had been much interefced in our loss. Tlhe
people are so afictiionate, so tradtable, anl d so peaceable,
that I fwcar to your highinefes, that there is not a
better race of mnc, nor a better country in the
world. They love their neighbour as themlk'lvcs;
their convcrfation is the fwCctcf. and( mlild(lft in the

w.orld,

world, cheerful, and always accompanied with a smile.
And although it is true that they go naked, yet your
highneffcs may be assured that they have many very
commendable customs; the king is served with great
state, and his behaviour is so decent, that it is pleasant
to fee him, as it is likewise to observe the wonderful
memory which these people ha:ve, and their desire of
knowing every thing, which leads them to inquire
into its causes and eftecls." Life of Columbus, c. 32.
It is probable, that the Spaniards were indebted for
this officious attention, to the opinion which the
Indians entertained of them as a superior order of
beings.

NOTE XVI. p. 149.

EvERY monument of such a man as Columbus is

valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdirand and
Isabella, deferibing what pasl(d on this occasion, ex-
hibits a most striking picture of his intrepidity, his
humanity, his prudence, his public spirit, and courtly
address. " I would have been less concerned for this
misfortune, had I alone been in danger, both because
my life is a debt that I owe to the Supreme Creator,
a;d because I have at other times been exposed to the
most imminent hazard. But what gave me infinite
grief and vexation was, tliht after it had pleased our
Lord to give me faitl to undertake this enterprise, in
which I hnd now been so fucclfsftl, that my opponents
would have been convinced, and the glory of your
hifihnefes, and the extent of your territory inereafed
hy me; it fliould pleafc the Divine Majefly to flop all
by my death. All this would have been more tolerable,

liltd

had it not been attended with the loss of those men
whom I had carried with me, upon promise of the
greatest prosperity, who feeing themselves in such
distress, cursed not only their coming along with me,
but that fear and awe of me, which prevented them
from returning as they often had resolved to have
done. But besides all this, my sorrow was greatly
increased, by recollecting that X had left my two sons
at school at Cordova, destitute of friends, in a foreign
country, when it could not in all probability be known
that I had done such services as might induce your
highnesses to remember them. And though I comforted
rnyfelf with the faith that our Lord would not permit
that, which tended so much to the glory of his Church,
and which I had brought about with so much trouble,
to remain imperfetl, yet I confidered, that on account
of my fins, it was his will to deprive me of that
glory, which I might have attained in this world.
While in this confused state, I thought on the good for-
tune which accompanies your highnefles, and imagined,
that although I Thould perifli, and the vessel be loft, it
was possible that you might somehow come to the
knowledge of my voyage, and the success with which
it was attended. For that reason I wrote upon
parchment with the brevity which the situation required,
that I had discovered the lands which I promised, in
how many days I had done it, and what course I had
followed. I mentioned the goodness of the country,
the character of the inhabitants, and that your
highnefics fubjets were left in poffelfion of all that
I had discovered. Having fealed this writing, I
addressed it to your higlinefles, and promised a
thloufand ducats to any person who flould deliver

it

it fealed, so that if any foreigners found it, the
promised reward might prevail on them not to give
the information to another. I then caused a great
cask to be brought to me, and wrapping up the
parchment in an oiled cloth, and afterwards in a
cake of wax, I put it into the cask, and having ftopt
it well, 1 cast it into the sea. All the men believed
that it was some ad of devotion. Imagining that
this might never chance to be taken up, as the ships
approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet
like the first, and placed it at the top of the poop, so
that if the ship funk, the cask remaining above water
might be committed to the guidance of fortune."

NOTE XVII. p 154.

SOXE Spanish authors, with the meanness of national

jcaloufy, have endeavoured to detract from the glory
of Columbus, by insinuating that he was led to the
discovery of the New World, not by his own inventive
or enterprising genius, but by information which he
had received. According to their account, a vcfl:l
having been driven from its course by easterly winds,
was carried before them far to' the weft, and landed,
on the coast of an unknown country, from which it
returned with difficulty; the pilot, and three sailors,
being the only persons who survived the dliltreflcs
which the crew suffercd, from want of provitions, and
fatigue in this long voyage. In a fewc days after their
arrival, all the four died(; but the pilot having been
received into the house of Colunmbus, his intimate
friend, disclosed to hlim, before his death, the secret of
tlie difcovcrv which he had accidentall ly made, anri

left him his papers containing a journal of the voyagej
which served as a guide to Columbus in his under-
taking. Gomara, as far as I know, is the first author
who published this story, Hist. c. 13. Every circum-
Itance is destitute of evidence to support it. Neither
the name of the vessel nor its destination is known.
Some pretend that it belonged to one of the sea-port
towns in Andalusia, and was failing either to the
Canaries, or to Madeira; others, that it was'a Bifcayner
in its way to England; others, a Portuguese flip
trading on the coafl of Guinea. The name of the
pilot is alike unknown, as well as that of the port in
which he landed on his return. According to some,
it was in Portugal; according to others, in Madeira,
or the Azores. The year in which this voyage was
made is no less uncertain. Monfon's Nav. Tracts.
Churchill, iii. 371. No mention is made of this pilot
or his discoveries, by And. Bernaldes, or Pet. Martyr,
the contemporaries of Columbus. Herrera, with his
usual judgment, passes over it in silence. Oviedo
takes notice of this report, but confiders it as a tale
fit only to ;iaufe the vulgar . IIili. ii. c. 2. As
Columbus hcld his courfei dire!lly weft from the
Canaries, and never varied it, fonme later authors have
supposcd, that this uniformity is a prouf of his being
guided by time previous infornm;tion. But they do
not rccollcet the principles on whiclh he founded all
his hopes of success, that by holding a weftcrly course,
hc mu{t ccrtainly arrive at those regions of the cafn

Tl-B

THE Spaniards are not the only people who have

called in question Columbus's claim to the honour of
having discovered America. Some German authors
ascribe this honour to Martin Behaim, their country-
man. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of
Schwartzbach, citizens of the first rank in the Imperial
town of Nuremberg. Having fludied under the
celebrated John Muller, better known by the name
of Regiomontanus, he acquired such knowledge of
cosmography, as excited a desire of exploring those
regions, the situation and qualities of which he had
been accustomed, under that able master, to investigate
and describe. Under the patronage of the Duchess of
Burgundy he repaired to Lisbon, whither the fame of
the Portuguese difeoveries invited all the adventurous
spirits of the age. There, as we learn from Herman
Schedel, of whose Chroniicon Mulndi a German tranfla-
tlon was printed at Nuremberg A. D. 1493, his merit
as a cosmographer raised him, in conjunEion with
Diego Cano, to the command of a squadron fitted out
for discovery in the year I483. In that voyage, he is
said to have difcovcred the kingdom of Congo. He
fettled in the illand of Fayal, one of the Azores, and
was a particular friend of Columbus. -lerrera, dec. i,
lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terreltrial globe made by
Behaim, on which he demonstrated the course that he
proposed to'lhold in fcarcl of the communication with.
the South Sea, which he afterwards ditcovered.
Gomara Hist. c. 19. Herrera, dec. II. lib. ii. c. 19.
In the year i492, Behaim visitcd his relations in
Nurcmberg, annd left with themi a map drawn with
Ills own hadl, lwhich is flill prcfcrved amongl tlhe
:rchives of the family. T'liu far the f:toy of Martilt
lBhlainim fems to be well authenticated.; but the ac-

c tllt:

count of his having discovered any part of the Neew
World appears to be merely conjectural.

IN the first edition, as I had at that time hardly any

knowledge of Behaim but what I derived from a
frivolous Dissertation de vero Novi Orbis Inventore,
published at Francfort, A. D. 1714, by Jo. Frid.
Stuvenius, I was induced, by the authority of Herrera,
to suppose that Behaim was not a native of Germany;
but from more full and accurate information, com-
municated to me by the learned Dr. John Reinold
Forlter, I am now satisfied that I was mistaken.
Dr. Forster has been likewise so good as to favour me
with a copy of Behaim's map, as published by
Doppelmayer in his account of the Mathematicians
and Artists of Nuremberg. From this map, the
imperfetion of cosmographical knowledge at that
period is manifest. Hardly one place is laid down in
its true situation. Nor can I discover from it any
reason to suppose that Behaim had the least knowledge
of any region in America. He delineates, indeed, an
island to which he gives the name of St. Brandon.
This, it is imagined, may be tome part of Guiana,
supposed at first to be an island. He places it in the
fame latitude with the Cape Vcrd isles, and I fufpea
it to be an imaginary island which has been admitted
into some ancient maps on no better authority than
the legend of the Irifli St. Brandon or Brendan, whose
story is so childifily fabulous as to be unworthy of any
notice. Girald. Cambrienfis ap. Mifliigham Florilegiuni
Sandorum, p. 427.

THE prctenfions of the Wlfll to the discovery of
America Cfem not to reft on a foundation much more

solid.

slid. In the twelfth century, according to Powell, a
dispute having arisen among the sons of Owen
Guyneth, king of North-Wales, concerning the fuc-
ceiffon to his crown, Madoc, one of their number,
weary of this contention, betook himself to sea in quest
of a more quiet settlement. He fleered due weft,
leaving Ireland to the north, and arrived in an
unknown country, which appeared to him so desirable,
that he returned to Wales, and carried thither several
of his adherents and companions. This is said to
have happened about the year 1170, and after that,
he and his colony were heard of no more. But it is
to be observed, that Powell, on whose tcitimony the
authenticity of this story refts, published his history
above four centuries from the date of the event which
he relates. Among a people as rude and as illiterate
as the Welsh at that period, the memory of a tranfation
so remote must have been very imperfeEtly prelerved,
and would require to be confirmed by tome author of
greater credit, and nearer to the era of Madoc's voyage
than Powell. Later antiquaries have indeed appealed
to the testimony of Meredith ap Rhees, a Welfl bard,
who died A.D. 1477. But he too lived at such a
distance of time from the event, that he cannot be
confidered as a witness of much more credit than
Powell. Besides, his verses, published by Hakluyt,
vol, iii. p. i. convey no information, but that Madoc%
dissatisfied with his domestic situation, employed
himself in searching the ocean for new pofFeflions.
But even if we admit the authenticity of Powell's
story, it does not follow that the unknown country
which Madoc discovercd by steering weft, in such a
course as to leave Ireland to the north, was any part

YOL. I. D B of

oT -Aefirica. The naval skill of the Welsh in the
twclfth century was hardly equal to such a voyage,
If he mrade afny discovery at ali4 it is more probable
that it Was Madeira, or fbme bther of the western isles.
The affinity of the Welfl language with rome diale&s
fibken in Aimerica, has been menrtioned as a circums
stance which Confinrs the truth of Madoc's voyage. But
that affinity has been observed in so few instances, and
in fore of tliefe is so obscure, or so fanciful, that no
conclusion can be ,drawn from the casual resemblance
of a small number of words. There is -a bird, which,
as far as is yet known, is found only on the coasts of
South America, from Port Desire to the Straits of
Ilagellah. It is diftingui{hed by the name -of Penguin.
This word in the Welsh language signifies White-head.
Almost all the authors who favour the pretensions of
the Welsh to the discovery of America, mention this
as an irrefragable proof of the affinity of the Wellh
language with that spoken in this region of America.
But Mr. Pennant, who las given a scientific defcrip-
tion of the Penguin, observes, that all the birds of
this genus have black heads, " so that we must resign
every hope (adds he) founded on this hypothesis
of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New World."
Philof. Trantfd. vol. Iviii. p. 91, &c. Beside this,
if the Wielfh, towards the close of the twelfth century,
had fettleldin any part of America, some remains of
the Chriflian dodrinc and rites must have been found
annong their descendants, when they were discovered
about three hundred years polterior to their migration;
a period so Illort, that, in the course of it, we cannot
well suppose that all European ideas and arts would be
totally forgotten. Lord Lyttelton, in his notes to the

fifth

fifth book of his History of Henry II. p. 371. has
examined what Powell relates concerning the dif-
coveries made by Madoc, and invalidates the truth of
his story by other arguments of great weight.

THE pretensions of the Norwegians to the discovery

of America, seem to be better founded than those of
the Germans or Welsh. The inhabitants of Scandinavia
were remarkable in the middle ages for the boldness
and extent of their maritime excursions. In 874, the
Norwegians discovered, and planted a colony in
Iceland. In 982, they discovered Greenland, and
established settlements there. From that, some of
their navigators proceeded towards the weft, and
discovered a country more inviting than those horrid
regions with which they were acquainted. According
to their representation, this country was fanlly on the
coasts, but in the interior parts level and covered
with wood, on which account they gave it the name
of Helle-land, and Mark-land, and having afterwards
found some plants of the vine which bore grapes,
they called it Win-land. The credit of this flory rells,
as far as I know, on the authority of the fJga, or
chronicle of king Olaus, cQmpofed by Snorro Sturlo-
nides, or Sturlufons, publilhed by 'Prliinfkiold at
Stockholm A.D. 1697. As Snorro was born in
the year l 79, his chronicle might be compiled about
two centuries after the event which he relates. Hlis
account of the navigation and difcovcrics of Biorn,
and his companion Lief, is a very rude confufcl talc,
p. 104. 11o. 326. It is impoflible to discover from
him, what part of America it was in which the
Norwegians landed. According to his account of the

B B 2 length

length of the days and nights, it must have been as
far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, on
some part of the coast of Labradore, approaching near
to the entry of Hudson's Straits. Grapes, certainly,
are not the producion of that country. Torfeus
supposes that there is an error in the text, by rectifying
of which, the place where the Norwegians landed may
be supposed to be situated in latitude 49g. But neither
is that the region of the vine in America. From
pcrufing Snorro's tale, I fiould think that the situation
of Newfoundtland corrcfponds befl with that of the
country difcovcred by the Norwegians. Grapes,
however, are not the producion of that barren island.
Other conjecures are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd.
a l'Hift. de Dennem. 175, &c. I am not sufficiently
acquainted with the literature of the north, to examine
them. It seems manifest, that if the Norwegians did
discover any part of America at that period, their
attempts to plant colonies proved unsuccessful, and
all knowledge of it was soon loft.

So firmly were men of science, in that age, pcr-

fuaded that the countries which Columbus had dif-
covered were connected with the East Indies, that
Bernaldes, the Cura de los Palacios, who seers to
have been no inconsiderable proficient in the knowledge
of cofinography, contends that Cuba was not an island,
but a part of the continent, and united to the dominions
of the Great Khan. This he delivered as his opinion
to Columbus himself, who was his guest for some time
on his return from his second voyage; and he supports
it by fevcral arguments, mostly founded on the'
authority of Sir John Mandeville. MS. penes me.
Antonio Gallo, who was fecrctary to the mngiftracy
of Genoa towards the close of the fifteenth century,
publishcd a short account of the navigalions and
difcovcries of his countryman Columbus, annexed to
his Opufeula Hiftorica de rebus populi Gcnuenfis ; in
which he informs us, from letters of Columbus which
he himself had fecn, that it was his opinion, founded

B D ? upoui

upon nautical bbfervations, that one of the ilands he had
ditcovered was distant only two hours br thirty degrees
from Cattigara, which, in the charts of the geographers
of that age, was laid down, upon the authority of
Ptolemy, lib. vii. c. 3. as the most easterly place in
Asia. From this he concluded, that if some unknown
continent did not obftrua the navigation, there must
be a short and easy access, by holding a westerly
course, to this extreme region of the East. Muratori

BERNALDES, the Cura or Reaor de los Palacios, a

contemporary writer, fays, that five hundred of these

Seville as slaves; but that, by the change of climate
and their inability to bear the fatigue of labour, they
all died in a short time. MS, penes me.

NOTE XXI. p. 196,

COLUMBUS seems to have formed some very (ingular

opinions concerning the countries which he had now
discovered. The violent swell and agitation of the
waters on the coast of Trinidad led him to conclude
this to be the highest part of the terraqueous globe, and
he imagined that various circumstances concurred in
proving that the fca was here visibly elevated. Having
adopted this erroneous principle, the apparent beauty
of the country induced him to fall in with a notion
of Sir Jollh Mandevillc, c. 102. that the tcrrcftrial

paradifc

paradise was the highest land in the earth; and he
believed that he had been so fortunate as to discover
this happy abode, Nor ought we to think it strange
that a person of so much f4gacity should be influenced
by the opinion or reports of such a fabulous author as
Mandeville. Columbus and the other discoverers
were obliged to follow such guides as they could find;
and it appears from several pafiHges in the manuscript
of Andr. Bernaldes, the friend of Columbus, that no
inconsiderable degree of credit was given to the tefti-
mony of Mandeville in that age. Bernaldes frequently
quotes him, and always with refpe&t.

NOTE XXII. p. 21.

IT is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo,

the moit ancient Spanifi historians of America, nor
Herrera, confider Ojeda, or his companion Vespucci,
as the first discoverers of the continent of America.
They uniformly ascribe this honour to Columbus.
Some have supposed that national rese-ntment against
Vespucci, for deserting the service of Spain, and
entering into that of Portugal, may have prompted
these writers to conceal the actions which he per-
formed. But Martyr and Benzoni, both Italians,
could not be warped by the fame prejudice. Martyr
was a contemporary author; he resided in the court of
Spain, and had the best opportunity to be exactly in-
formed with respeCt to all public tranfaftions; and
yet neither in his Decads, the first general history
published of the New World, nor in his Epistles,
which contain an account of all the remarkable events

1 B 4 of

of his time, does he ascribe to Vespucci the honour
of having first discovered the continent. Benzoni
went as an adventurer to America in the year 1541,
and resided there a considerable time. He appears to
have been animated with a warm zeal for the honour
of Italy, his native country, and yet does not mention
the exploits and discoveries of Vespucci. Herrera,
who compiled his general history of America from the
most authentic records, not only follows those early
writers, but accuses Vespucci of falsifying the dates of
both the voyages which he made to the New World,
and of confounding the one with the other, in order
that he might arrogate to himself the glory of having
discovered the continent. Her. dec. i. lib. iv. c. 2,
He asserts, that in a judicial inquiry into this matter
by the royal fiscal, it was proved by the testimony of
Ojeda himself, that he touched at Hispaniola when
returning to Spain from his first voyage; whereas
Vespucci gave out that they returned directly to Cadiz
from the coast of Paria, and touched at Hispaniola
only in their second voyage; and that he had finished
the voyage in five months; whereas, according to
Vespucci's account, he had employed seventeen
months in performing it, Viaggio primo de Am.
Vespucci, p. 36. Viag. fecundo, p. 45. Herrera
gives a more full account of this inquest in another
part of his Decgds, and to the fame effeCt. Her.
dec. I. lib. vii. c. ;. Columbus was in Hispaniola
when Ojeda arrived there, and had by that time come
to an agreement with Roldan, who opposed Ojeda's
attempt to excite a new infurredion, and, of con-
fcquence, his voyage muff have been posterior to that

es

of the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 84. According
to Vespucci's account, he set out on his firit voyage
May loth, 1497. Viag. primo, p. 6. At that time
Columbus was in the court of Spain preparing for his
voyage, and seems to have enjoyed a considerable
degree of favour. The affairs of the New World
were at this juncture under the direction of Antonio
Torres, a friend of Columbus. It is not probable,
that at that period a commiflion would be granted to
another person, to anticipate the admiral, by under-
taking a voyage which he himfclf intended to perform.
Fonseca, who patronized Ojeda, and granted the
licence for his voyage, was not recalled to court, and
reinstated in the direction of Indian affairs, until the
death of prince John, which happened September
1497, P. Martyr, Ep. 182. several months posterior
to the time at which Vespucci pretends to have set
out upon his voyage. A life of Vespucci was published
at Florence by the Abate Bandini, A.D. 1745, 4to.
It is a work of no merit, written with little judgment,
and less candour. He contends for his countryman's
title to the discovery of the continent with all the blind
zeal of national partiality, but produces no new evi-
dence to support it. We learn from him that Vespucci's
account of his voyage was published as early as the
year o150, and probably sooner. Vita di Am. Vefp.

THE form employed on this occasion served as a

model to the Spaniards in all their subsequent conquests
in America. It is so extraordinary in its nature, and
gives us such an idea of the proceedings of the
Spaniards, and the principles upon which they founded
their right to the extensive dominions which they
acquired in the New World, that it well merits
the attention of the reader. " I Alonfo de Ojeda,
servant of the most high and powerful kings of Castile
and Leon, the conquerors of barbarous nations, their
messenger and captain, notify to you and declare, ill
as ample form as I am capable, that God our Lord,
who is one and eternal, created the heaven and the
earth, and one man and one woman, of whom you
and we, and all the men who have been or shall be in
the world, are descended. But as it has come to pass
through the number of generations during more than
five thousand years, that they have been dispersed into
different parts of the world, and are divided into
various kingdoms and provinces, because one country
was not able to contain them, nor could they have
found in one the means of subsistence and preservation;
therefore God our Lord gave the charge of all those
people to one man named St. Peter, whom he confti-
tuted the Lord and head of all the human race, that all
men, in whatever place they are born, or in whatever
faith or place they are educated, might yield obedience
unto him. IHe hath fubjeted the whole world to his
jurifdilion, and commanded him to eflablifli his refi-
dencc in Rome, as the molt proper place for the

govcrilllnill

government of the world. He likewise promised and
gave him power to establish his authority in every
other part of the world, and to judge and govern all
Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and all other
people, of whatever fe& or faith they may be. To
him is given the name of Pope, which signifies admirable,
great father and guardian, because he is the father and
governor of all men. Those who lived in the time of
this holy father obeyed and acknowledged him as their
lord and king, and the superior of the universe. The
fame has been observed with refpea to them who,
since his time, have been chosen to the pontificate.
Thus it now continues, and will continue to the end
of the world.

< ONE of these pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath

made a grant of these islands, and of the Tierra Firme
of the ocean sea, to the Catholic kings of Castile, Don
Ferdinand and Donna Isabella, of glorious memory,
and their successors, our sovereigns, with all they
contain, as is more fully expressed in certain deeds
pafied upon that occasion, which you may fee, if you
desire it. Thus his majcfty is king and lord of these
islands, and of the continent, in virtue of this donation;
and, as king and lord aforcfaid, most of the islands
to which his title hath been notified, have recognised
his majesty, and now yield obedience and fubljecion
to him as their lord, voluntarily and without resistance;
and instantly as soon as they received information,
they obeyed the religious men fcnt by the king to
preach to them, and to inftruit them in our holy
faith; and all these, of their own free will, without
any recompence or gratuity, became Chrillians, and

colitinue

contifue to be so; and his majety having received,
them graciously under his protection, has commanded
that they fliould be treated in the fame manner as his.
other fubjets and vassals. You are bound and obliged
to ad in the fame manner. Therefore I now entreat
and require you to confider attentively what I have
declared to you; and that you may more perfetly
comprehend it, that you take such time as is reason-
able, in order that you may acknowledge the Church as
the superior and guide of the univerfc, and likewise
the holy father called the Pope, in lis own right,
and his majesty by his appointment, as king and
sovereign lord of these islands, and of the Tierra
Firm ; and that you consent that the aforesaid holy
fathers shall declare and preach to you the do&rines
above mentioned. If you do this, you aEt well, and
perform that to which you are bound and obliged;
and his majefly, and I in his name, will receive you
with love and kindness, and will leave you, your
wives and children, free and exempt from iervitude,
and in the enjoyment of all you possess, in the fame
manner as the inhabitants of the islands. Befidcs this,.
his majesty will bestow upon you many privileges,
exemptions, and rewards. But if you will not comply,
or maliciously delay to obey my injunction, then,
with the help of God, I will enter your country by
force, I will carry on war againllt you with the utmolt
violence, I will ftthjct you to the yoke of obedience
to the church and the king, I will take your wives and
children, and will nmake them slaves, and fell or dispose
of them according to his mnjefly's pleasure; I will
seize your goods, and do you all tlle imitclicf in my
power, as rebellious fubjcCl[, who will not acknow-

I(ldge

ledge or submit to their lawful sovereign. And I
protest, that all the bloodflhed and calamities which
shall follow are to be imputed to you, and not to his
majesty, or to me, or the gentlemen who serve under
,me; and as I have now made this declaration and
requisition unto you, I require the notary here present
to grant me a certificate of this, subscribed in proper
form." Herrera, dec. I. lib. vii. c. 14.

BALBOA, in his letter to the king, observes, that of

THOUGH America is more plentifully supplied with

water than the other regions of the globe, there is no
river or' stream of water in Yucatan. This peninsula
prpjets from the continent a hundred leagues, but,
where broadest, does not extend above twenty-five
leagues. It is an extensive plain, not only without
mountains, but almost without any inequality of
ground. The inhabitants are supplied with water
from pits, and wherever they dig them, find it in
abundance. It is probable, from all those circum-
stances, that this country was formerly covered by the
sea. Herrerae Defcriptio India: Occidentalis, p. 14.

NOTE XXVII. p. 341.

M. CLAVIGERO censures me for having represented

the Spaniards who failed with Cordova and Grijalva,
as fancying, in the warmth of their imagination,
that they saw cities on the coast of Yucatan adorned
with towers and cupolas. 1 know not what translation
of my history he has consulted, (for his quotation from
it is not taken from the original,) but I never imagined
that any building ereced by Americans could suggest
the idea of a cupola or dome, a ftruaurc which their
utmost Ikill in architecture was incapable of rearing.
My words are, that they fancied the villages which
they sav from their flips " to be cities adorned with
towers and pinnacles." By pinnacles I meant some
elevation above the reft of the building; and the

passage

pafflage is translated almost literally from Herrera,
dec. 2. lib. iii. c. I. In almost all the accounts of
new countries given by the Spanish discoverers in
that age, this warmth of admiration is conspicuous;
and led them to describe these new objeCts in the
most splendid terms. When Cordova and his com-
panions first beheld an Indian village of greater
magnitude than any they had beheld in the islands,
they dignified it by the name of Grand Cairo, B. Diaz.
c. 2. From the fame cause Grijalva and his aflociates
thought the country along the coast of which they
held their course, entitled to the name of New Spain.
