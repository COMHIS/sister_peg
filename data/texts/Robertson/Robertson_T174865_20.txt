which the other Wi~orks t of this e-

a I~HERE is no employment more delighit-

plation of the divine, wildom, in thle go;-

vernment of this world. The civil hif~lory of mann-
krind opens a w/ide field for this pious exer cife.
Car~eful observers may o~ften, by the ligh~t of r~ea-
son, form probable conjeatures with regard to theZ
plan of God's Provide-nce, and can discover a fril-

f-u

[6]

ful hand, dire~ting the revolutions of human as-
fairs, and compassing the best ends, by the most
effedtual and furprizing means: Eut sacred history,
by drawing aside that veil which covers the coun-
feis of the Almighty, lays open his designs to the
view of his creatures, and we can there trace the
fleps which he taketh towards accomplithing them,
with more certainty, and greater pleasure. The
faats which ins~pired writers relate, are no les~s in-
firudtive, than the do~rines which they teach.
The latter inform us, that God is powerful, and
wife, and good; the former discover those per-
feaions brought forth into adtion, and confirm
specu-lative opinions, by real and firiking exam-
ples.

THE publication and eflaiblifh~ment of Chriftia-

nity in the world, is a remarkable event of this
kind, and contributes greatly to illuffrate and
magnifyr t~he divine power and wild~om. From be-
ginnings the rnoft inconsiderable, and by infiru-
ments the most unlikely, · the Almigh~ty, with in-
credible facility, raised that glorious fabric of hiis
Church, which hitherto hath withstood all the rage
of his enemies, and the gates of hell we believe,
}hall not prevail aga~in~2 it ". According to our Sa-
viour's beautiful image, ~The leaf2 of all Eeedis gr-ewz
u~, cand wax~ed a greact tree, and Jpread ouat its branches,

this feeble plant friom th2e florm, and by his care
it was reared, and cultivated, and ibroug~ht to ms-
turity. The wil~dom and power of men united to
oppole the doarinet of God : But it confounded
the former, and overcame the latter. Ne~iither the
bigotry of the Je~ws, nor the superstition of the
Heathen, could refif its progres~s; and in vain
did Herod and Pontiuks Pil~ate, with the G~entiles, and
pieople of IJfael, gather th~emselves together aegain/? the
Lord~ andZ hj iAnointed #.

MANY CITOUG1Rat~ nces concurred in procuring,

fo~r Christianity, sauch a favourable reception, and
firm eft~ablifhmnent in the world. Wh~oever re-
fleats upon the situation of mankind at the time
when it was publifhled, will find abundant reai-on
to admire the divine wisd~om, which dilpofed there
circumitances wit~h so much art, and improved tlhemn
withn such skill and fixnceefs. The texut naturally leads
mne to confider the conduat and adminiffration of
Providence, in :this particular light. 'The weord ·of
·God, faith the Apostle, the myfieryr hEid from a~ges,
and from generationzs, is nowe m~ade mnanzfe/2 to his fints.
Why was the gorpel oyf Christ so long concealedf
from the world ? Why was it publiihed at that
time ? WThat do we find in that particular junaure
to render the discovery of the Christian religion
more necessary, or the propagation of it more fuac-
cef~sful ?z

" Acts iv. 27.

IN ther following discourse, I thall endeavour to

account for this part of the divine aeconomy, by
feledting some remarkable circumfitances, in the
situation of mankind, which prove that God maanj-
fef ~ed the mlyf~ery of the Gospel, at a time when the
wvorld stood most in need of fich a revelation, and
wvas best prepared for receiving it.

TH IrE a ppearTRCe of Christ in to late an age, was

an objedtion raised, by his ancient adversaries
against the truthi of h~is Mim~on - and modern in-
Edcels have not failed to revive and. urge it, with
their us~ual confidence and triumph. But, if we
can establish the truth of our general propolition,
this cavil falls to the ground, and the divine con-
duA is fuilly vindicated.

I. ABou T the time ~f~ Chrift's appearance, there

jprevailed a general opinion, that the Almighty
would fend forth some eminent: messenger, to
communicate a more perfed dilcovery of his will
to mankind. The firpreme Being conduafs all his
operations by general laws. It s~eems to be one
among ther~e, that no perfe~ion of any Kind, can
be attained of a su~dden. The motion, by which
his works advance towards their finished and com-
pleat state, is gradual and prog~refive. This holds
with regard to all the produC~ions in the natural,
and all the changes in the moral world. The fame
principle appears to have regaulated the dilpenla-
tions of religion. The light of revelation was not
poured in upon manki~nd; all at once, and with its

full

full [plendior. The oblrurity of the dawn went
before the brightners of the noon-day. The will
of God was at firR rnade known by revelations,
useful indeed, but dark and mnyfierious. To these,
succeeded others more clear and perfed. In pro-
portion as the (ituation of elhe world ma~dei it necef-
far.y, the Almfighty was plea~led farther to open and
unfold his ichenie. And men came by degrees to
understand this progrefilvee plan of Providence, and
to conceive how fyfitemls teapofrary and in~orn-
pleot might serv~e to introduce that concluding and
perse4 revelation, which would declar the wh~ole
council of God to madn *.

The dignity of the perfou emp~loyed to pubflif

this revelation, the virtues of hischarad~er, the glo-
ry of his kringdom, and the ilgns of his coming,
were deferibed by the antie~nt Prophets with rthe
utmpft perspicuity. Guided by thisJ~n fre wod of
pr~ophesy, the Jews of thalt ge .casefudedl the pe-
riod predet-ermined by God, to be then completed s
and that th~e fuellne/~s o timze being come, the promi-
~ed Meffab wov~uld suddenly appear. DevoIt per·
tons amon~g them, wi~iztedE day a~Nd nighlt for' th consi

ons a by their conversation with the learned men
among the Heathens ; and by the translation of
their inspired writings.., into a language almot uni
versal ; the principles of their religion were ipread
all over the Eait : and it became the common be-
lief, that a Prince would arise3 at that time in Judea,
who should change the face of the world, and ex-
tend his empire from one end of the earth to the
other.

hr this due time, did the wisdom of G~od f~end

forth his Son, not to aflbrae any strange charadter,
or to claim any new and unknown dignity, but to
fulfil all that had .beena Jpoken by the mou~th of his ho-
ly proph~ets fce th ·e orld began t. While the eyes
of men where employed in search of the promised
Mefliah; while they watched every sign that could
indicate his coming :andi oblerved every circum-
itance which could lead them to discover him a
whi'le the emareJ2 expec~ation of all creatu~res zeaited for
the revelation of God ; at that happy and favourable
JunAure, was the myfiery hid fromz ages manifeited to
the world. No wonder, the Jewzs th-ould receive
our Savioulr, on his firit appearance, not only with-
out prejudice, but even with eag~ernef's and ap-
plause : No wonder the Gentiles thould gather tog~e-
ther unato him, who had so long been the deifre of all
nations *. Had Christ been manifested at a more
early period, the world would not have been prepa-

red7

rsed to meet him with the f~ame fondneifs and zeal:
Had his appearence been put off for any confide-
rable time, men's expedi~ations would have begun
to languish, and the warmth of desire, from a de-
lay of gratification, might have cooled and died
away.

II. BEr r, it is not only from circumstances pe-

culiar to the Jew~s and neighbouring nations,
that we conclude~ the Chriflian religion to have
been publithed at the most pm~per time: -We
propose to bring a farther conlfirmation of this
truth, from a fiurvey of thle condition and circum-
flances of mankind in general. Let us venture
then into this large field, and takce a view of the
political, of the moral, of thle religioue, and oif
.the domeffic state of the world,

~nE begin, by considering the political slate of.

the world about the time of our Sa~viour's appear-
ance. The world, in the moif· early ages, was di-
vided into fmnall independent Ratles, differing from
each other in language, manners, laws, and reli-
gion. The thock of so many opposite interests,
the interfering of so many contrary views, occa-
fioned the most violent convulsions and disorders.
Perpetual discord f~ubifted between there rival
slat~es , and hoffility and bloodlhed never cealed,
during that turbulent and reftler~s period. Com7-
merce had not hitherto united mankind, and open-
ed the communication of one nation with another.
The world may now be consider~ed as one vast so-

Bz 2 iety,

c;it~ty, closely cemaented by; mutual wants; echzt
Bpart contributing its fharle towards the fubiiftence,
the pl'eafure, and improvement of thle whole. But
in throfe more fitnple ages, the intercourse between
hat~ion~s was extremely inconsiderable. Voyages
into remote countries, in quest either of wealth or
of knowk~dge, were very rare. Mezn moved in a
narrow circle, little acquainted with any th~in~g be-
yond the limits of their own fmIa~l territory, and
utter strangers to the condition and charaater of
difaiacnt nations.

ATr last the Rgomanl ambition underto~ok the1 ar-

dulous enterprize of conquering the world, anid
cbnduaed it with fixch refined policy, irresistible
coutrage, and inimitab~le perseverance, as, in the end,
crowned the attempt with fazccefs. lbe~y~ trade dboewn
the kin~igdomsr, according to Dtsanel's prorphetic de-
fEription, and by thte~ir exceedling f~;ireth, they dzevour~-
ed the whoale erarthq. However, by enslaving the
w~ord, they civilized it - and whike they oppressed
mankind, they united them together. The ~a~me
laws were elvery where eftabblifhed, and the fame
languag~es underfood. Men approached nearer to
on~e anothber in ferrtirments and manners. Tkhe in-
tercourfe between thle maoft difi~ant corners of the
earth was rendered f`cur-e nd agreeable. Sa-tiated
w~ith viatory, the firfit Emperors abandoned all
thoughts o new conqu~ests. Peace, an unknto~wn

pire, or if a flighlt war was wage-d on an ourtlying
and barbarous frontier, far from disturbing the
tranquillity, it fesarcely drew the attention of
mankind.

Srrn was the political slate of the world, wh=n

Christianity made its Birit appearance ; andJ, from
this representation of it, many circumffances oc-
cur to jufftify the divine wisdom, in chufing that
particular conjlunaure, for publishing it. D~uring
the period, which I fir~st defEribed, the propagation
of any new religion, muff have been extremely
flow and uncertain. How could it have forced its
way, through innumerable difficulties, arising from
the unsettled Rate of the w-orld, from the fierce-
ness and animosity of hoffile and divided nations ?z
Th~e power of God, no doubt, could have fixr·-
mrounted all thiere o'btacles : But- it is oblervable,
that this power is never exerted but on the most
treceffary occasions. The Aimighty s~eldom effeas,
by s~upernatural means, any thing, which could
have been accomplished by fulch as are natural.
And were we to judge by maxims merely humnan,
the propagation of Christianity, in those circum-
flances, would have proved not only a dang~erous
but an impofible enterpnize.

BrrT, favoured by the union and tranquillity of

the Romaznr empire, the disciples of Christ executed
their commifflon to great advantage. Thle fiuccefs
and rapidity, with which they difufi~ed thle k-now-
ledge of h~is name over the wlorld, are aftonithing.

'T I· s

Th~is ep~istle to the Co~lofaS, was written about
thijrty years after our Saviour's ascension; and
even then, the Apostle could assert, that the goipel
hlad been preached to evercy creatur~e w~hich is undier
heaenzn ", i. e. through the whole extent of the Ro-
maznl empire. Nations were then acceflible, which
formerly had been unknown. Under this fitua-
tion, into whichi the Providence of God had
brought the world, the joyJful ound, inl a few years,
reached those remote corners of the earth, into
which it: could not, otherwise, have penetrated
for many ages.

T~is view of our fbbjeat, presents to us an idea

of the Christian religion, equal to the greatest and
rnoft magnificent conception of the hiuman mind.
The noblest ipeople, that ever entered upon the
flage of the world, appear to have been only in-
firuments in the divine hand, for the execution of
wif~e purpoles conceal~ed froi-m themfielves. The
Rimanl ambition! and bravery paved the way, and
prepnred the world for the reception of the Christian
deftrine : Th:ey fought an~d conquered, that it
might triumphl with the greater ease. Hobzeid2t,

Ill. LE T us COnflder the slate of th~e world, with

reard rrto morals. Wecannot expeCt to find pure
and undefiled virtue, amongY those people.1. who wer
deflitute of the infiruAions, the promiles, and
aif~fance of divine revelation. Unenlightened
reason ~often errs : Undireated virtue freqluently
deviates from the right path. But, even inl those
less favoured ages, righteoufnels had not altoge-
t her penfsede fr-om the eacrth , anad the naztionzs which
had not the law, didZ by natu~re thE thing~3S contained zin
the law f·. Those virtuous but feeble efforts of the
human mind, were encouraged and se~conded by
several happy circumstances in the situation of the
world, owing in appearance to the sagacity of men,
but ordained in reality by the wisdom of God.
One of there was of a singular nature, ancd well
deserves our particular attention.

V7Es have already mentioned the early diviron

of the world into small independent slates. ~TheG:

places, and founded those eqlual and happy govern-
ments, which have been th~e admiration and envy
of all fucceedingr ages. Temperance, frugaltyr)-
decency, public spirit, love to th~eir fe~low-ciri-
zens, magnanimity, were thle virtues which flou-
rithed under s~uch wife inilitutions. At the fame
time, in thlofe Imall commonw~ealths, the sciondu
of every citizen was [ubjeded to the eye of the
magii~rate; and the nature of the government
obig-ed him, to infped their manners, with feve-
rity. Thbe fmi~alleft crimes could not escape obfer-
vation . Even dangerous virtu:es w~ere expdied to
cenfilre. On this fo~un~dation of puiblic liberty, did
antient virtue reit; an effedl of government little
k~nown in modern times, whlerein thle views of le-
giflators are confin,-d to inferior· objecas. But
from th s source, were derived all tble s~plendid
nations among the heathens, wYhich, on thie one
hand, have been so invidiously me~ntionied by infi-
dels, as a reproach to our holy religion, and on the
othler, so juffly celebrated by ChriRians, in or-
der to rouze the zeal and emulation of a dege-
nerate agre.

VIR TUE, however, did not long enjoy this temr-

pogary and precarious support. Those wife initi-
tutians were the w~orks of men, and, likie their au-
thors, fbbjeat to decay. Some of them perithed
by the: mabignity of internal difeares: And, if a vi-
gorous constitution or more sk2ilful management
prolojn ed the p-riod of other·, they: yielded at last

to the violence of external injuries. It was impost
fible either to divert or ref2Rt thle torrent of Roman
p:ower : It gathered itrength from opposition, and
bore down all nations before it. 13ut, by fabduing
the world, the Romans lo~t their own~ liberty.
Many causes, which it is not our prefeat business to
exp ain, concurred in producing this effed : Many
vices, engendered or nourished by prosperity, deli-
vbered them over to the vilest race of tyrants that
ever assisted or dirgraced human nature.

THE alliance between morals and government

was now broken i and an influence hitherto so
friendly to virtue, became altogether malignant,
and was exerted with moRt fatal fuccers, to poison
and debas~e the human mind. Together with deT-
potic power, entered all those odious vices, which
are usually found in its train : and in a thort time,
they grew to an incredible pitch. Thle colours
are not too strong, which the· Apostle employs in
drawing the charader of that age : Contemporary
hifforians juffify him, when he deferibes it to be
alienated from the hife of God, ·ra~lking in vaEnity thro'
bhindnefs ofC mind , to be paJZ feeling, and given u~p to
lia/civiou/ne/~s, and to wzeork all uncleinne/s with~ grceedi-

but to ered it upoil the eternal and immoveable

the Authority of G~od. Wh~at the wisdom of men
could' do for the encourbgemnent of virtule in a cor-
rept wor~ld, had been tried during several ages;
and all human d~evices were found, by experience,
to be of very frnall avkil : So that no jumature
cottld be more proper for publithing a religeion,
which, independent· on human laws and inftituti-
ons, explains the principles of morals with admi-
rable pe~rpicuity, and eniforces the proaice of
them by m~ost periliafive arguments. H~ad not

pernicious effeats of derpotic unlimited empire, it
is hiard to fay how far they might have gone to-

IV. LE T US confider the cworld with regard to

jits religious sl-ate. ThBe national chaara~ter .of the
Jews, fTeems to have been deeply tin(5tured with
s~uperstition. Thei4· early edu~cation in Egy-3pt the
example of neighbouring nations, the influence of
the climate, but above all the perverSeness of their
own difpolition, rendered this impref~lon ind-elible.
Obitinate against all the endeavours employed by
the divine Lawgiver to repress or extirpate it, this
superstitious spirit broke out on every occaflon.
Delighted with the ceremonial preforiptions of the
law, the Jews utterly negle~ted the moral : And,
fond of such rites as please the imagination, they
undervalued thos~e duties which improve the heart.
This unhappy bials was greatly increased iby the
doffrine of the Pharifees, which reduced the pre-
Jud-ices of their country~men into a regular ijyfiem
of fiiperftition. By their vain traditions, they ad-
ded to the load of ceremonies: By their wretch-
ed interpretations of the law, they abridged the
number of moral precepts. They openlyr prefer-
red the former before the latter; and fCubftituted
ob'ervances frivolous and insignificant, in the
pl ace of the ·weighty mantters ina the lawre, jac~gment,
m1ery, and faiithF *.

WHILE the Pharifees undermined religion, on

one hand, their rivals the Sadducees carried on,
from another qjuarter, a more bold and imnpious

* Mlat th. x xiii, 23-

C 2 attack;

attack against it. By denying the immortality of
the foul, they wounded religion in a vital par t;
and overturned the do~trine of future rewards and
punishments, which hath been, and muff ever be,
the chief foundation of virtuous obedience. The
pradtice of those two contending seas, was
perfedtly suitable to the~ir principles. The fol-
lowers of the one, were Icandalous libertines;
the disciples of the other, notorious hypocrites :
And between them, the knowledge as well as power

oftrue re igion were entirely destroyed. It was
high time then for the wisdom of God to vindicate,
his injured law, and to revive languishing and de-
cayed religion, among his ancient people. To
recal the Jews from their former wanderings, the
Almighty haad with success employed the miniffry
of his holy Prophets: But the malignant diftem-·
pers of that age, would not hiave yielded to any
common remedy : A conceited and perverse gene-
ration would have listened to no inferior meffen-
ger; and therefore, the great Prophet was sent
forth mn this due time, to explain, to extend, and
to perfea the law, azd to fill Zionz writh judgment aand
rgl~~hteouf~ne/s *.

Bu'r the deplorable situation of the heathen

world with regard to religion, called iiill more
Joudly For an immediate interpolition of the divine
hland. I thall not mention the charadters of the
heathen deities, infamous for the most enormous

crimes ;

crimes; nor deferibe their religious worship, con-
sifting frequently in the vilest and most thameful
rites. Certain it is, the more any man honoured
s~uch gods, the worse he himself was; and the of t-
ner hie served them, the more wicked he would
becorme.

THE spirit and genius of heathen religion are

what I thall endeavour to represent. Thel~e, ac-
cording to the Apoftle's observation, were in all
thinzgs too mu~chJu~perlittious *. Stately temples, ex-
pensive sacrifices, pompous ceremoniis, mnagnifi-
cent feitcivals, with all the other circumitances of
thew and iplendor, were the objeats which false
religion prelented to its votaries: But just notions
of God, obedience to his moral laws, purity of
heart, and f~anaity of life, wlere not once men-
tioned as ingredients in religious service. Super-
dtition never prevailed among any people, but at
the expence of mor~als. The heathen superstition,
far from giving any aid to virtue, seems not to
have had the leait connedtion with it. No re-
p~entan~ce of past crimes, no future amendment of
condua, ar~e ever prescribed by it-, as proper means
of appealing their offended deities. " Sacrifice a
chosen vidtim; bow down before an hallowed
Image, be initiated in th~e sacred mysteries; and
the wrath of the gods shall be averted, and the
thunder thall drop from their hands." Suitable to
thlere sentiments, is the behlaviour of Ba~la King of

Afoab,) defcibed by .the Proph~et Mlllicab. Thiat
Prince had provioked the God of Ijkael, and in or-

HA1PruvY, the wirdom and simplicity of antient

governm~ent, checked the progress of this infedtious
pninciple, and correaled, in some degree, its poi-
fonous and detrudrive qua~lities. But, no sooner
hlad the ty:ranny of the Romzant Emperors removed
thisj reitrainr, by subverting liberty, than fuperf i-
tronl made its advances on the world by s~udden
and m7igh7ty Rleps, and exercised an uncontrolled8

and fiiper~ltition, like those other deitroyers of man-
ikind, famine and ?pes ilence-, are nearly allied.
::uperflriton break~s th~e spirit, and p~repares it for
servitu~de. Tyranny, for this reason, encourages

to illegal power. Accordingly, Rome adopted the
gods of almoB every nat-ion, wihomn the h~ad con-
qiuered ; and opened her temples to the groffeit
superstitions of the most barbarous people. Her

AT this time, therefore, did a g-ood God, in

pity to his deluded creatures, publish the Chlriftian
revelati on. By it, the God of truth was made

humane and beneficent in its precepts, pure andd

V. LE T US confider the world w~ith regard to

its domeflic situation; a view, perhaps, less exten-
live and magnificent than thofet, which hitherto
have engaged our attention; but not less impor·-
tan t. The private and domestic situation of man-
kind, is the chief circumfftance, which forms their
charad~er, and becomes ·the great source of their
happiness or mirery. Any poison in thiis fountain,
communicates iti-elf to the manners of men ; any
biittmernel there, idfeas all thle pleafilr~es of life.
M~any circumfltances, of the most fatal influence
on domestic: virtue and happiness, occur to atteni
tive oblervers of the periosd under review.

DOMESTIC ibciety is founded in the union be-

tween husband and wife. Among all civilized na-
tions, this union hath been esteemed sacred and
hounourable; and from it are derived those exqui-
site joys or sorrows, which can imbitter all the
pleasures, or alleviate all the pains in human life.
In the antient worldi, there prevailed two pradcices
equa"lly pernicious to the peace anld happiness of
the married slate. From the most earlyr times, poi
lygamy s~eems to have: been un~iversa~l among the
eastern nations; and mien mnarried as mfany wives
a-s th~eir fancy wviihed for, or their fortune could
maintain. Now, this pradIce not only appears to

SLuke i. 74·

C 25

be contrary to the intention of the Almighty, who
at first created but one person of each sex, and
hath since prefer ved an admirable proportion be-
t ween the number of males and females, whorn
he sends into the world ; but, by it, likewise, were
banished from dorneftic life, all those enjoyments
which rweeten and endear it. Friendlhip, focidl
mntercourfe, confidence, and the mutual care of
children, were in a great measure unknowvn : On
the one hand, rigour, voluptuouf~nefs, jealoulyr; on
the other, fulbjedtion without love, fidelity, or vir-
tue. One half of the human ifpecies became the
property of the other; and the husband, initead of
being the friend and protedtor of a wife, was no
better than the master and tyrant over a slave.
The envy and discord which were introduced in-
to the families of 'facob and ~Elkanaah, by a plura-
lity of wives, are but impedfed pidures of the
enormities occasioned by the ifame pradiice, under
-masters less virtuous, and in ages more dissolute
and luxurious. Whereever the Christian religion~
is established, an end hath been put to an inflitu-
tion so inconfiltent with the felicity of domeffic
life. Mlarriage, s~uitable to the ordinance of God,
is rendered a friendly and indissoluble alliance be-
tween two persons: and tranquillity, conf~dence,
and joy' blers an union, begun and cemlented byr
mnutual love.

IN the weffern parts of the world, the maxims

with regard to marriage were more confot-rnable

DI to

to3 nature : One man was: confined to one woman :
But at: the fame time, their laws allowed a praftice,
which introduced the most fatal disorders into do-
meftic life. The Almighty, becau/e of the hardness
of their hearts, permitted the Jews, on certain oc-
cafions, to give a wreritinjg of divorcement to their
zeaves 1 According to their ufulal cuffom, the
Jiews fi~retched thsis indulgence to most extravagant
lengths and, defining the caf~es in wrhich they
pretended-divsorces to be lawful, with a minute and
o~ver-cunious accuracy, they altogether perv-erted
thle in~ittution -of God. Their DodOrIs permitted
'divorces for causes so trivial and ridiculous, as
cannot be mentioned in a grave difcoulrfe. The
utmost dissol~ut-ion ·of m~an-ners, was the effeGt of
such licentious opinions :- And our Saviour found
the :abul~es to be growrn To enormous, as to render
the itridtet -and moit precis~e limitations of the
MofaiDRc prrecept ablolutely necessary.

N\oa was this mza~tter on any better footing ai

mofg thle heathnen nations. Divorces, on very
fljght pretences, weret permitted both ·by Greek and
Roman legislators. And though the pure manners
of those republica, ref trained, for some time, the
operakion of iuch a paernicious inflitution ; though
the virtue of privante persons seldom abused the in-
dulgenbce which the laws alo~wed th~em : Yet no
sooner had the progress of luxury, and the eftablith-

ment of delpotic power, vitiated the talte of me~n,
than the law with regard to divorces, was found
to be among the worit corruptions which prevailed
in that abandoned age. The facility of eparation
rendered married persons careles~s ofobtaining or
pradtifing those virtues which render domeflic life
tranquil and delightful. The education of child-
ren was negleaed by parents, who often met to-
gether wYith a scheme of separation in both their
thoughts. Marriage, initead of reitraining, added
to the violence of irregular desire; and under a
legal name, became the vilest and most thamelefs
proffitution. From all there causes, the married
slate fell into difreputation and contempt; and it
became necessary, to force men, by penal laws,
m~to a society where they expedted no s~ecure or
laffing happiners. Among the Romans, domeffic
corruption grew, of a s~udden, to an incredible
height; and perhaps, in the hiffory of mankind,
we can find no parallel to the undisguised impuri-
ty and licentious~nes~s of that age" *.t was in a
good time, therefore, that our Saviour abolished
a pradtice, which had been one of the most fertile
sources of those disorders. The bonds of the
marriage-union were, by him, rendered almost
indissoluble; and the cordns of love were drawn as
clos~e as poflible. Political projedtors may please
themselves with imaginary advantages, resulting

from the liberty of divorces a but reason?, as well
as the experience of mankind, juffify the wif~domr
of the divine decree concerning them. If the
manners of men be not extremely pure and simple,
the least indulgence in this article hath always
proved fatal to the peace and virtue of domestic
life; ands whatever r-emains of there we now find
in a dissolute age, must be intirely aleribed to that
regulation in the golpel *, which superficial reason-
ers reprefernt as a grievance, though it be in truth
the greatest blefling to mankind.

Ir the lives of thol~e, who are at the head of do-

mneftic society, needed reformnation , the f~ufferings
of those who were f~ubje61 to them merited relief.

So many are the wants of humnan society, that

~far the greater part of mankind is condemned to
contant toil and labour in order to s~upply them.
In the antient world, the condition of this nume-
rous and useful race of men, differed widely from
that, wherein they are now placed. They were
not freemen, but slaves, who occupied the inferior,
though necessary, flation in hman life. Their la-
Bour, was not a voluntary duty to the society,
which intitled them to a reward; it was an hard
talk, imposed without their consent, and exa~ted
with the utmost rigour. The number of persons,
ryeduced to this unhappy condition, was immens~e.
In those parts of the world, whole hiffory and i--

tuation are best ktnown, above t wo thirds of thle
whole inhabitants are computed to have been in a
state of slavery. The persons, the goods, the chil-
dren of these slaves were the property of their
mallers, diipofed of at pleasu~re, and transferred,
like any other poffeffion, from one hand to ano-
ther. Nuo inequality of condition, no fulperiority
in pow·er, no pretext of consent, can juffifyr this
ignominious deprefnion of human nature, or can
confer upon one man, the righlt of dominion ovser
the person of another : But not only doth reason
condemn this inflitution as unluft ; experience
proved it to be pernicious both to mat~er-s and
slaves. The elevation of the former, inspired
them with pride, insolence, impatience, cruelty,
and voluptuoufhefs : The dependent and hopeleifis
Rtate of the latter, dejeAted the human mind, and
extingulfhed every generous and noble principle
in the heart. Were I to mention the laws and re-
gulations of the most civilized Itates among the
antients, concerning th-ose unfortunate fu~fferers;
were I to relate the treatment which they met with,
from persons the most renowned for th~eir virtue ;
maxims to inhumane, and aftions fa barbarGUS,
w~ould excite the firongeft pity and indignation, in
ane age, which never beheld the tyrannyr of the
oppreflor, nor heard the groans of the, captive.

IT is true, while men enjloyed those wrife initi-

tu~tions of government, which we formerly defcrib-
ed~, thp frate of se~rvitude did not~ becom~e altoge-

ther intolerable; many expedients were used for
mitigating the rigour of command, and lightening
the yoke of obedience: But, upon eftablithing def~-
-potic government in the Romzan Empire, domeffic
tyranny rose, in a th~ort time, to an astonishing
height. In that rank foil, every vice, which power
nourithes in the great, or oppreflion engenders in
the mean, thrived and grew up apace.

HER E then is an objeat worthy the attention of

that merciful God, who? delivereth the Joul of the ass-
fidted from violence, wh~o hearethJ the cry of the neediy,
andr him whbo hath no helper +. T he groans of fu ch
an innumerable multitude of his reafosnable crea-
tures, bereaved of the noblest privilege of their
n~ature, liberty and independence, would not, we
miay believe, be uttered in vain. H-3e could not
alway~s keep flenzce and be fi'll, when he be~held their
wretched situation, so deffrudtive of happiner~s,
and to fatal to virtue. At last, the divine wisdom
interposed ; and when the evil had become intoler-
able, and s~eemed to be past cure, the promulgation
of Christianity brought an eff~eaual and timely
remedy.

I~r is 'not the authority of any single detached

prec~ept in the gorpel, but the [pirit and genius of
Ch~ristian religion, more powerful than any parti-
culair command, which bath ab-olithed thle praaice
of slavery· through the wvorld. The tempepr, wh~ich

dishonourable s~ervitude into which it was fulnk.
All men, of everyr condition, are dedlared to be
the offspring of the fame G~od, an~d tihe heirs of
the fame heavenly inheritance : One Saviour re-
deemed them from iniquity by his death, and -one

ever such opinions prevail, no human crea~ture can
be regarded as altogether insignifican-t -and vile 4

due to the generous pirPiit of that religion, which
reffored liberty,.ne~t to one nation or faciety alone,

TMwE abolition of domestic slavery was the oc-

cation of another change in the manners of men,
which is no less remarrkable. Captives taken in
war, were, in all probability, the first persons sub-
jeated to perpetual se~rvitude:: And when the ne-
ceffities or luxury of mankind increased the de-
mand for slaves, every new war recruited their
number, by reducing the vanquished to that
wretched condition. H~ence proceeded the fierce

And if avarice hath· revived, in a degenerate world, an initi-
tution, which Christianity had utterly abolish7ed ; this, like
many other vices which prevail among Christians, must be

slaver-y were the certain lot of the conquered,
ba3ttles were fought and towns defended withi a
rage and obst~inacy, which nothing but horrot at:
filch a fate could have inspired : But by putting
an end to the cruel inflitution of slavery, Chfifltia-
naity extended its mild influences to the praAkce of
war a and that barbarous art, foftenedl b~y Jts hu-
rnane spirit, cealed to be so, deffrudtive. Secure,
mn every event, of perional liberty, the resistance
of the vanqcuifhed became less obstinate, arid the
triumph of the vialor less cruel. Thus h~umranity
was introduced into the exercifre of war, with
which it appears to be almnoft incompatible; and
it is to the merciful maxims of C'hritianity, much
more than to any other cause~, that we must aferibe
the little ferocity and bloodshed, which accompany
modern via~ories. Even where the ·patlion~s of men
are fierceit, and moss highly infla~med, the power-
ful genius of ou~r religican interpoles, reffrains the
fury of war, and sets bounrds to its deftroying-ra~ge.

iierceRt and moit barbarous nations, and inspiring
a gentieneis of difpolition, unknown to any other
re igion. Together with the bet rpiritual bleflings,
the meot valuable temporal mercies have been
communicated to the world, by Christianity. It
nrot only fagndifies our f~ouls, but refines oulr man-
ners; and while it gives the pr-omis~es of thle next
life, it improves and adorns the prelent : That
happy change, which thle wildom of m-an could not
effedt, God in his good tirne accomplithed by ma
n~fe/ilig to the w~orldi the myfie/ry hid~ from ages and ge-

geit many useful refleaions, withI regard to thbe

ledge. At the time when the dilciples of C~hrist
iet ou~t, in obedience to their Lord's command,
to teach all nations; no undertaking could appear
ms the judgrnen t of man more wild and impradi-
eable. But, besides thle blefl~ng of God, which ac-
companied them where-ever they went, we have
dif'covered freveral circumfiances in the situation of:
the world, which contributed powerfully towards
the faccefs and facility of their enterprize. Aided

brinrg to sought things that ar~e *. That the fame es-
featual bleifiug of God still continueth to second
every sincere and vigorous attempt, to spread the
knowlectge of his name, we have good reason to
believe. WM7hat powerful unknown causes may~
co-operate with this blefling of th~e Almighty, wec
are not permitted yet to discover. It cannot, howv-
ever, be more improbable, that the influences of
Christianity shall reach farther, than it once was,
that they should reach so far. And, after we have
seen the light of the gospel penetrate into so many
dark ·places of the earth ; wYhy doth it seem incredi-
ble, that its [plendor thould, at last, fill the world,
and s~catter: the. remainder of darkness which co-
vereth the ]nations ?

IT is obvious to obs~erve one circumnftance, which

cannot fail of introducing the gospel into difiant
nations with great advantage. That part of the
world, wherein Christianity is eftablithed, infinite-
ly surpasses the reft in all the sciences and improve-
ments which raise one nation above anaother in re-
putation or power. Of this superiority the Euro-
peans have availed thems~elves to the utmost, in e-
very projeat for extending their empire or com-
merce; and have brought a great part of the
globe into a dependence, either upon th~eir arts

But the converfron of diffant nationS, is not the

c~hief care of the Society for propagating Christian
Knowledge : An objeat nearer at hand demands
their more immediate attention. The Highlands
and Islands of Scotland pres~ent to us a i[cene,
which we would little expedt in a nation where
true religion and polilhed manners have long flou-
rifhed. There, society still appears in its rudest
and moit imper-fed form : Strangers to indu-
ftry, averse from labour, inured to rapine ; the:
fierce inhabitants scorn all the arts of peace, and
stand ready for every bold and despe-rate adtion.
Attached to their own cuffoms, from ignorance
and habit, they have hithereto continued a separate
people. And though the religion eftablithed among
th-em be, the fame which we enjoy, its progress
hath been imperfea ; and the fixed Pastors were
never able to surmount thle diladvantages of their
situati;on, or the obstinacy of their people. In this
negleated field, the~ enemies of our religon and li-
berty have sown the feeds of the worst su~per-

alon~e in this noble work. The reformation of thre

lature :But rouzed by a late danger, it hath frnce
merited their rnore particular attention. Suitable
to this view, laws have been enadted ·with a most
humane spirit, in order to retrieve that part of the
kingdom frorn ignorance and barbarism, and to

SH E piety and real of a few private perons,
Agave rife to this Society, about the yrear

r700. The propagation of Christian Knowledge,
among their countrymen in the Highlands of
Scotlandz, was the only objeat which they at first
proposed to themselves. A design to laudable
merited public encouragement; and, in I709,
they were erealed into a body corporate by let-
ters-patent frorn Queen Anne. The donations,
which they have received, since that timre, 'frotr
char-itable persons both among ourselves and our
neighbours, have enabled thern to carry on their
f~cherne with considerable fatccers.

BY f~ettling schools in the .moil remote cornerS

of the Highlands, where children are infiruAed in

F the

[42 1

thle principles of true religion, they· have in a g~reat
mealitre defeated the pernicious adtivityi of the
Popilhi mrilionaries : By teaching the children un-
der their care to Tpeak and read the En~ghfh/ lan-

uge,1~T they~ hae ad am pores oars n
corporating- those wYho formerly ipok~e only the
Ibbitp'ngue with~the reft of the Ifliand : By instil-
ling into their minds an early knowyledge of the
Chr iftian doatrines, they hope by degrees to re-
claim them from that fierce and barbarous course
of life, which is to contrary to the humane and
gentle !p~irit of thle gol~pel.

TH E funds of the Society are not considerable ;

but: the members have endeavoured to supply this
defed by the mos1 frugal aeconomy, which hath
put it is their power to prosecute their plan, to an
extent iar beyond. what they cou~ld have expeaed.
Near 70,000 persons have been educated by the
Society fiprce its firfc. commencement. At present,
its schools amount to the number of I55c, at which
no fewer than 5831 children are educated. Ther~e
fCchools are under the immediate infpeaion of the
Prelbyteries, inu~whole bounds they lie. Whoever
is .acquainted with the geographiy of the country,
will finld them to be situated in the wildest, and
least civilized places of the Highlands and Islands.
Anld, could the . unds of the Society permit,
schools might be opened with no less advantage, mn
many other-places of that extens~ive country.

To change the manners of a whole people, must:
be the workr of unwearied 'perfeverance ard. atten-
tion. Attached by habit and example to the cuf~-
toms of their anceffors, the children educated by
the Society were too ready to forget the good
principles which they had been taught ; and the
love of idlenes~s and rapine often wore out the im-
premrons which religion and virtue had made in
their minds. In order to provide a remedy for
this, the Governours of thle Society applied for a
new charter, wh~ich they obtained in r738 ; and
by it, they are im-powered to infirude the children
under their care in the different parts of agricul-
ture, trade, and rnanufadtures. To the execution
of that part of their plan, they have recktoned
thems~elves impowered to apply those su~ms, whjIch,
by the express destination of the Donor, ar-e not
appropiated for the other ends of the Society.
Andi now,~r when there fulms have amounted to
something worth notice, thley are beginnling .to lay
them out in this wnay. But those funds which1
belonged to the Society previous to th~e date cif
of thieir new charter, and whatever new donations
are granted them to be employed in the religious
education of youth, they itill apply wyith the ut-
mott fidelity to that pur~1pole alone. For there rea-
sons, ther progreifs of t~he Society, in this part of
their uzndertaking, must needs be gradual. H-owv-
ever, thie attempts wihich~ th~ey makec, have been
attended wi:t1 fiich :iicefs~, aIs abundtantly juffi-

Sfies the wisdom of the scheme. Happily, theib
two branches of their design are intimately con-
neated. Where-ever true Christianity is establish-
ed, it improves, adorns, and perfeats human so-
clety. IReligion and induffry go hand in hand,
firengthen and eflablifh one another. Coeformable
to the spirit of~ their feccond patent, the Society·,
[mee the commencement of the year r1755, have
engaged to support a design, which seems greatly
to merit the public attention and encouragement.

THE Honourable Board of Truffees for imnprov-

ing the manufadures and fisheries in Scotlnand, have
agreed to employ part of their funds in fettling
finall ~olonaies of linlen-manuf'adtures in different
parts of the Highlands. The flation of one of
there colonies, they have fixed at Loc-hcarron, a
place which by its situation appears to be very
]proper for that purpole. The Truffees have al-
ready provided a. flfficient number of mnanufadtu-
rers for this new settlement, and have appointed
skilful overseers to diredt them. The Proprietor
of thne lands of Lokchcaron, who0 hath given all the
encouragement· in h~is power to this laudable un-
dertakring, represented to the T~ruffees, that be-
sides the different tradeihmen employed by them,
m, the linen manufaatory, a fchloolmafter wvell-qua-
lIfied for in~trudting youth, a blacksm-ith, a fthoe-
rnaker, a cart-wright, and a ploughman, would be
of great advantage to this infant-colony. How-
ever much the Trufftees approved thi~s proposal,

t hev

C 45 1

they could contribute nothing towards the execu-
tion of it. The funds under their management
are appropriated by aGt of Parliament for the en-
couragement of the linen-manufadtory and the
fiiheries a and they had no powers to employ them
for any other purpos~e, however necessary. But,
by their direation, the Proprietor applied to th~e
Society for propagating Chlriftian Knowledge, in
order to obtain its charitable afliflance to promote
so good a design.

THE Society, whole furmds have been raised in,

tirely by private contribution~s, was not limited
by the famte rfitriations which bound the Truil
tees. The design appeared to the M~embers to be
ufefll and well-concerted : It is per~fedly suitable
to the spirit and intention of their second patent :
It tends evidently to encourage religion, virtue,
and indufftry in the H~ighlands. They: resolved,
therefore, to promote it in the most effeatual
manner that their funds would permit. For this
purpole, be~sides a, schoolmaster, whom they have
f~ettled at LOChcarrOn, they agree to allowy confide-
rable yearlyi iflaries to a black~-smith, a fhoemakcr·,
a cart-wrrighit, and a ploughman, wlho are1 to be emn-
plbyed by thlem for five years. The ploughrman
is to infirua~, grati, all that offer~ thlemfelvrs ;
and the othe~rs are obliged to inlthua a numbter of
apprenticEs, and to give maintenlance ait bed a~nd
board to them:, if th!e Society finds th~at exYpedient,
at a reasonable rate, to, bS. paidI by~ the Sozciety

[ 46 ]

And if, in other places of the H-ighlands, the
famne plan could be followed out, the inhabitants,
whoo have hithierto been burthenfame to the nat-i-
on, from idleness, or formidable, by their adtivity,
might at last become us~eful, induffrious, and valua-
ble me~mbers of society.

BESIDEs their endeavotirs towards the inficrud-

ing and improving the H~ighllands, the Society has
of late been engaged in a new and more extenlive
undertaking. Th~e late Dr. ~i'illialms, and forne
other well-difpofed persons in E1lnglad, confiding
in the prudence and fidelity of the Society, have
committed to thieir- management certain fuims
whichi they ordain to be employed for the infiruc-
tion1 of the Inia,~ns inl Amerilca. Conformable to
their pious intentions, the Society have dispatch~ed
M'Viionaries into thiat country , and though in so
wide and negleaed a field, the induffry of a few
labourers can produce no great or ildden1 efeat,
ye"t, from" their Riccers, it is evident, that, with
pro'per cIohivation, a blessed and joyfuil increa~e '
migiht be ex ecr~ed.

THNERE are irideed many obstacles, w~hich retardf

th-e propagpation of Chlriftianity in thlat corner of
th:e rorl·d. Amrrong: the Iadianls, in the neighbour-
hoodC of oulr colonies, focrcietyt is flill in its simplest
f or m : Thecy lead t'he unfetrtled life of savages,
who~ fi~;pport thiemfelves by hunting, and wander
fromn one place to another in q~uest of game:
They:~> are div·idedc into many [mall tribes, differing

f~rom?-

1: 47 1

From each other in language and in manners : Alt-
tached to their own superstitious rites, they disco-
ver great averflon to the Christian religion, which
is but ill-recommended to t~hem by the example oft
many who profess it.

NoTWlrITHSTANDING all there dis~advantages,

the Society. has the pleairtre to hear from Mlr.
Braier-d their M/iflionary, that many among- tle
I~ndians whom he hath formed into a Chri~ia.n con-
gregation, Riill continue. JedfafZ and in;nzoveable in
the profeflion of the golpel : And he is not with-
out good hlopes of adding to their number by h~is
diligence and carie.

ATr a time, when the friendatip of the Indiann

nations appears to be of so great confeqluence to-
wards th~e security and preservation of our A9meri-
can colonies, no attempt to infirudt them, how-
ever feeble, ought to be regarded with indifference.
Every person among them, whom we gain over to
the belief and pradice of true Chriflianity, becomes
from th~at moment the ally of Br-itain, and is bound
to its inteereR by a powerful and iFacred tie.

FRoMv thlis brief account of the intention anci

mnanagement of the Society for propagating Chri-
fbian Knowledgae, the Members flatter themselves,
that the formner will be efteemesd commendable,
and that in the latter the cannot justly incur th~e im-
putation either of imprudence or unfaithfulrners

EVERY good man will bless God who hathi ho-

nored the Society to b~e hlis infiruments for pub-lish-

mng

ing the Golpel of Chriit to io many persons who
mult otherwise have perybedc for lack of knoweledge :
And every man capable of refle61ion, will approve
institutions of this nature which-contribute so much
to prepare the world for the full rnanifeitation of
the myjiery bid from ages and generations ; wehen the
deaf fall hear the weords of the book, and the eyes of the
blind jhall fee ouct of obscurity and oult of darkrefs ,
whiena the meek shall increase their joy rin the Lord, and
the poor among m1en j all rejoice in the Holy One of
Israel.
