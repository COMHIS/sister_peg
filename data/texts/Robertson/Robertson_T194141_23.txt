# PREFACE.

PRE FACE

ANCIENT CrREECEZ ieelTs to hrave been pe-

culiarly chosen by Heaven as the ifcene on

which mankind were destined to dis~play,7 in the
12tmoft perfedlion, all the Cuperior faculties that;
distinguish; them so highly above the other ani-
mals on this earth. For it is an incontrovert-
ible fa~t, that, with the exception of a few ge-
neral notions of some particular branches of
knowledge derived to them from Egypt and
the East, the ancient inhabitants ofS that coun-
try not only invented, but carried to the highest
pitch of improvement, almost: all the sciences
and liberal arts. -The moderns, indeed, have
attained to many discoveries, which, for the
most part, were to those ancient Gre~eks un-
kIrnown. But, on an accurate investig~ation, we
fhlall perceive, th~at some of the most: important
of' thos~e dis~coveries have been the refrult of mnere
accident; that others have been produced solely
by the repeated experience of many ages; and
that the greater part of' them are of s~uch a nla-
ture, that the pure force of` geniurs alone never
could have found thern out.

In all the Polite Arts, however, which the

Ancient Greeks appear either to have fludied or
praf5tired; and in every matter of science, with-
out exception, they are universall~y ackno~wled-
ged to have excelled. Htence their works ine

the more sublime parts of philosophy; in gea-
metry ; m poetry, eloquence, and every other
species of composition; in s~culpture; and in;
architeaure; always have been, and in all pro-
bability ever will be, the most perfedt models
produced by the ingenuity of man. :Of this
truth the writings of Aristotle and Plato ;
of Euclid; of Homer, Sopholes, and Euri-
pides; <if Demosthenes a of Thucydides and
Xlenophon, together with the remains of Gre-
cian s~culpture and architeature still to be fCeen,
afford full and fatisfaidory evidence: And the
-most approved performances on the fame s~ub-
jeats in modern times, are, generally speak~-
ing, valuable in proportion to the acquain-
t~ance of their authors with those precious relics
of antiquxity.

But the merit of this wonderfu~l people, as

philosophers, fine writers, and artists, was, per-
haps, their least prair~e. If we view them in the
m~ore adive and important stations of public
life; in the chatra~i'ers of legislators, flatefinen,
generals; we ihall find greater reason still to ad-
znire their virtue and capacity. 1iVhat other na-
tion in the world cian boast of such legislators as
L~ycurgus and Solon, of s~uch flatefrmen as Ari-
slides, ThemiLtocles, Pericles; of such generals
as Cimon, Epaminondas, ~Ageflaus; not to mren-
tion a multitude besides, justly celebrated for
th~e f~amre talents ?

The country of Greece, though of leifs extent

than that of England, was inhabited by a great
variety of different slates, perfealyp independ-
ent of one another, remarkably opposite in their

x ~mannerSI

PRE ACE

cf &

maanners and difpo~tionsi: but all a~dhated. by
the mroft ardent spirit of valpur and liberty. As
thos~e slates were pretty nearly of equal for~ce, it
became absolutely neceirary for them to be at-
attentive to keep the balance of power properly
poise~d, and to prevent any one itate from ac-
quiring s~uch an increafre of firength as might en-
able it to enslave thie reft. . W~e shall fTee, accor-
dingly, that this wais the ~grand obje~t of all their·
wars and negociations ; that they put in pradtice,
upon every occaifon, the 7if~ef~t and most refined
policy, for preventing the too great aggrandirie-
mient of each other; and that they never hesitated
to s~acrifice friendship, res~entment, anld every
other se~condary confdideration, to what they ac-
counted the highest of all concerns, the m-ainl
taining of the general independency of tlheir
coun cry.

The f~aae Cpirit of liberty enabled them to

oppo-Ce -the ambitious attempts of two of the
mxoft powuerful monarchs that ever filled the Per-
11an- throne, Darius and Xerxes, with a bravery
so romantically heroic, as to have no parallel
in the hifforical annals of any other people, and
wfhich, were it not: accefied past all possibility of
doubt, almost exceeds the bounds of probability.
But, not satisfied with defeating in Greece the:
utmost efforts of those Persians to s~ubdue them,
the Greeks, eager for revenge, res~olved to push
thneir advantage, and to attack the invaders ine
their own dominions. This dtefign they carried
into execution, first under Cimon, and after-
w~eards un~der Agefilaus, besides s~everal interme-
dsiate attempts a and that with a su~ccess that

A 3 plainly

W PRE SAC E.

plainly showed them capable, had they proceed-
ed with unanimity and perseverance, of effedt-
ing the grand revolution referred to imnmorta-
lize the name of Alexander, that of totally' sub-
verting the Persian empire. The Persians find-
ing thems~elves unable to vanquilh~ the Greeks
by open fored, took a more effeatual method toa
overcome them, in consequence, as we are told,
of the advice of Alcibiades, one of the mnoft ex-
traordinary men that Greece ever produced.
They fludioufly fomented the natural jealousy
entertained by the - Rtates of one another ; kept
them, by that means, in continual war ; and,
in the mean time, artfully afifited them, as
circumstances required, with liberal fulpplies of
money to work out thpeir mutual deftruation.
But the Perfiians ~were not destined to reap the
fruits of their pernicious politics, which even-
tually occafloned their own ruin. For Philhp
king of Macedon, one of the diftri(5s of Greece,
profited by those diffenflon~s of the other Greeks
to make them fixbjeA to his authority ; and at
last his son, the Great Alexander, in profecutiorn
of the plan laid down by his father, ranged thern
under the Macedonian banners, subdued, with
their afirftance, the powerful empire of Persia,
and marched viAorious from one corner of the
vast continent of Asia to the other,

But as, on the one hand, those Greeks prac-

tired, in the greatest perfeAion, every virtue,
whether public or private; and carried to the
highest degree of improvement of which, per-
haps, they are capable, the powers of gemius
and unde~ritanding; a o, on the other hand, they

PRE FACE si

gave way, ahnoRt in the fam-e proportion, to e-
very folly and vice, whether moral or political,
H~ence we shall have an opportumity, xn the per-
ufal of their hiftery, of contemplating the admi-
rable effeats resulting fromt the former course of
life, and the Imif~erable consequences inevitably
ocedxloned by the latter;i a contrast which, of all
others, forms, if we millake not, the zooft cu-
rious and infirudive part of hiftery.

The Hiffory of Ancient Greece likewise pre-

f~ents us more, perhaps, than that of any other
nation, with the most lively pidiure of the a'd-
vantages and disadvantages arising from each of
the various ilyttems of government that have
prevailedl in the world, monarchy, aristocracy,
democracy, with all the different modifications
and combinations of therie, that the policy of
~manlkind hath ever devis~ed.

Fromn all ther~e confjiderations, it must be ap-

parent, that whoever aspires at superior diftinc-
tion, either as a philosopher or as a man of
taste, in a military or in a political capacity,
can by no other means more effe~tually accom-
plifh his purpose than by a careful fludy of the
G~reek authors, by an attentive perusal of their
History,. and by a judicious application of the
maxims there explained and enforced.

The former publications on this fubjeft in

the English language being on a diffeirent feale,
as well as on a different plan from the pres~ent,
the Author is happily freed from the very dif~-
agreeable talk of attempting any comparison.

# INTRODUCTION.

.r TRdUTI N

11F contiienrto. f Ancienit Gr~eece comiprdxernded that
country which at present coultitutes the foutherra

gart of Turkey in Ext~rope. It ^was bounded on the
cas~-t by the Jf~gean s~ea,· now c~alled the ArchiQpeao; oni
the ·sout-h by the Cretain fed -; o~n the weft by the lonianr
lfea, or kd~riatic gulf ; and on= the north ~by Illyria and
~thrace. Its length, from worthr to so-uth,; w~as abouti
$So miles; arid its bi-eadth, a~t a medium,~ might be
re-ckoned a~bout 250 miles. -It is s~ituated nearly in the
mitddle of the northern t~emperate zone.

Greece may be~ properly diftinguiifhed into fii princi-

pal divisions. O~f these the snoft northe-rn was Mnce3-
donia : imrnriediately fodtit of IVfacedonia lay ffhefaly .*
Epirusr firetched along thbe coast of the Ioni~an sea, a~nd
iv~as the moss weltern diviflon : Achaia, or Gre~ece pro-
perly to called, occupied. the mlidd'le Space : and .the
inoft fatithernl division wdis PielopolnneJgo, kinowvn at pre.
·sen~t by the name of the NIoarea, which, -as the aricierit
name imnports, fai-med a peninrfula, cormmimicatiing; with
Achaia by the ifth~mu's of Corinth, a neck of land abouit
fix~ miles broad i the I/lan~ds made the f~itth dithfionI.

Tht: climiate of Greece wIas Peculiarly excellent. ' E-.

·qually exemp~ted frtim the t'igorous cold which a~ffiats
the inhabitants nearer to the poles, and fror the fuktry
-beat bjr which those wi~thiI t~he- torrid zone are op-
presse~d, It: abounded with every influence propiti~ous to
the humart race. The air was -fwieet, healthful, and unri.
.formlly temperate; invigorating· withourt chilnrefs, and
ifof without efferninacy.

The fail correfposided withk the -climaite. It produced,

SPn extraord~inaryr plentyr, -not- o~nly all the neceisaries, but
l ikewrife many of the luxcuries of l'ife.

The mrildners, purity, and ha'ppy temprerature of this

Attrnate, midit, without all question, have had a power-
t hl effea upon those who wcere there born and educated.

mind animated wNith feelings at once to juff, so delicate,·
and so acute.

Geogrcaphical D3e/ription of APncurr GREECE.
'TH$ hiffory of no people can be diflintly underflood,

Qmlefs the geography of their country be known. This
·observation applies to the hiffory now under confidera-
tion morde itrongly perhaps than to the hiffory of a'ny
other nation, For the territory of Greece having~ been
parceled ouit among many separate Rtates, their dis~putes
and their iranf~iakions with each other, as well as their
various military expeditions, form, without a particular
knowledge of the geography of the country, a mass of
unmnte~lhgible confuiion.

In another view likewise an acquaintance with the

geography of ancient Greece is of singular utility. It is,
if we may dfe the exprefhon, the key both to the Greekr
and to the Romnan poets, whose works abound with con-
itant alluffons to the rivers, the mountains, &c. of an-
clent Greece. For these reasons we h~ere lay before
she reader a particular but concis~e defEription of that
country. GREECE, as before oblerved, was diffinguflfhed into
fix principal divisions, viz. Macedonia, Thessaly, Epirus,
Ac~haia or Greece properly to called, Peloponnefus, and
the flaands.

T`he Romans diffributed all the country into; two pro-

Trinces, liacedomia and Achain; the former compre-
hendmng Macedonia, Epirus, T'heffaly j the latter, A-
chala, Pelo~ponnefus, and the Islands. In our deferip-
tionr we thall adopt th~e more ancient division.

1MA CE>O NIA WaS bounded on the north by the

Scardian mountain~s, by which it was separated from II.,
lyrium and Maefia, and by the river Strymon, its boan,
dary with Thrace;-on the east, by the JEgean sea or
Archipelago;-on the south, by Thessaly and Epirus ;-
and on the well, by the Ionian sea, or Adriatic gol-f.

A~ccording

18tobrding to Iflinjr, it was· more ancientifi occupied by
1 so different tribes.

The most considerable rivers in Macedonia were A-

liacmo~n, Erigon, Axius, Chabris, and Strymon, which
sil dif~icharge themselves into the Archipelago; Panyafus,
Apfus, Laus which washes Apollonia, and Celidnus on
the confines of Epirus: There run intoi the Adriatic gulf.

The niolit nozte~d mountazin fin Macedonia was Athos,

twhich firetches out into the Archipelago in the form of
a peninsula. T'hrough this mountain Xerxes is said to
have ordered a passage to be dog for the fleet w7ithi
iWhich he inviaded Greece.---n inflance of egregious
folly, indeed !

The tawns tisf chief rio~te 111 MIacedonia were D~yrra.

chixim; ancientlyl Epidamnus4 a maritime town on the
;Adriatic golf; 4ella, on~ the' river Axius, famous for

being ,t e pae where Philip, and his so~n Alexander

the Gre~at, drewv their first breath ; Theflalonica, whithrer
Cicero was banithecd by the intrigues of the fac~tious
Clodius i Stagirst, on the river Strymon, in the neigh-
bourho~od of Mount Athqs, famous by being the birthl
place of the Prince of Philosophers Aristotle, thence
called the Staglirite; Amphipolis, anciently poffeffed by
an Athenian colony, and remarkable by the disputes
wvhich it attafion-ed herween Philip and the APthenians.

T'he diffridt of Iliacedonia called Pieria, is celeb~ratPd

in ancieixt fable as having been the bir th-place of the
M~uses, thence often denominated Pierides.

Tut iSSA~LY lieS imnmediately south of M~acedornia, and

north of Achaia, havinzg the Archipelago on the east,
and Mount Pindus, which d~ivides it from Epirus, on
the weft. It was anciently famous for its excellent
c~avalry.

Peneus wa~s the ;chietf river in Thess~aly. It runs be-

tween the mountains offa and Olympus;- and meran-
dringr along in gentle wfindings through a country de-
lightfully variegated by groves and meadows, it forms
the capital ornament of the delicious

Vbale of Tempe, deferiibed with rapture even by poets

1-e B whoto~

wthofe eyes were accuttomed to the profpe~t of some of
the finest countries in the wiorld.

The most noted mzountains of T~hessaly are Olympus,

Pelium, and OffaI to famous in fable by the war of the
giant s.

Between Thessaly and Phocis, at the bottom of Mount

Oeta, lies ther defile of Thermopyla=, a pass about 90
foot, bro~ad, wkthich formed in a manner the portal of the
southern diffrifts of: Gre~ece, and is on that, account fr~e.
quently mentioned in hiffory. But it is chiefly renown.
ed by the heroic Rand made there against the Persian
army by Leonidas and his Spartans.

Thessaly was more anciently accounted a diffrift of

IVMacedonia, and was called Emonzia. It was likiewife
focceffively knrown by the names of Pelargicum, Hellas,
Driopis, Argis, and Theifalia, derived from the names
~of different kings to whom -it was f~ubjlel. At length
the name of Tlhefagly prevailed. Homer calls the inhabi-
tants of this country Myrmidones, Hellenes, Acheei.

It was divided among the following trib'es; the. Thef-

Falians, -the Eftioate, the Pelargi, *the Magnefii, and the
Phthiotte.

The diffia~i of the Theffa~lians contained the townts of

Hypata, Softhene, Cypera : That of the· Efiotae, those
of Gomphi, Phafitus, Tricca, and Etinium : That of
.the Pelargi, Pytheum- and Atrax : T'hat of the Magnefii,
Jolcus, H-erminium, Caffanea, Me(-libcea, and Methone,
at the fiegre of which King Philip· loft one of his eyes :
Trhat of the Pht~hiotse, OPhthia, where Achilles was born,
Theffalian Theb~es, Echinus, Lariff~a, Demetr ias, where
the MLacedonian kings for fame: time -kept their court,
and where ·in later times the Etolians held their public
assemblies; and lattly Pt-gafe, where Atrgo, the famnous
thip in which Jas~on and his followers failed in quest of
the golden fleece, was built.

Er IRUS was s~eparated fro-m Macedonia and Thessaly

by the river Celidnus and M~ount Pindus, and from
Atcha~ia by the river Achelous.

The

·The mountains Acroceraunia and Pindus are the most

remarka~ble in Epirus. TIhe latter is composed of a
very extensive ridge of bills, which separate, as above
observed, E~pirus from IVacedoniia and T~hessaly, and
firetch from the Acroceraunian mountains to. Mount
Oeta; which latter may be considered as the termrination
of Pindus.

Acheron and Cocytus mere the moRt confiderablae

rivers in Epirus. From thefei riv~ers, and the adjacent
country, Homer, according to Paufai~nias, formed his
defeription of the infernal regions.

Epirus contained the following towuns. Dodona, an

the diffriaR of the MoltfiT, famous for the temple and
oracle of Dodonean Jove, where the responses were said
to be delivered fromt the adjacent grove by black pi-
geons. What ridiculous imposition on the prepofferous
curiosity of mankind ! Th'is oracle was known an the
days of Homer and Hesiod; and, according to Strabo,
ceased in his time. Buthrotum, in the -djifri~t of
the Threlprotians, where King Pyrrhus kept his court.
In the neighbourhood of this city Cicero liad a large
estate, on which he sometimes refid ed.~-A--mbracia,
near the bay of the fame name, the royal residence of
the 1Eacidae. Acaium, off the promnontory of which,
now called C~ape Figalo, happened the important naval
engagemerit between Ocaavius Ccafar and IMark An-
thony, which decided the fate of the Rom~an empxre In
favour of the former.---,-Nicopolis, opposite to Ac-
tium, on the other fide of the bay, built by OAavius
Caesar, in memory, as the name imports, of his viatory
juit mentioned.

ACHAIA, or Greece properly to called, was bounded

on the sporth by the mountains Oeta and .Othrys, by
which is was separated from Theffalyy ; on the east, by
the Jigean sea or Archipelago ; on the weft, by the
river Achelous, which divilded it fr~om Epirus ; and on
the soot~h, by the isthmus of Corinth, a neck of land
about fixr riles long, terminated by the bay of Corinth,

L)s 3 no wr~

now called Lepantto, on· the weft, and by the Saronic
bay, or bay of Egina. on the east~.

The mnoft rem~arkable mnountainsrz of ·Achala were

Collidromus, on the border towards Thessaly, over-
hanging the pass of Th~ermop~yla::. Over this mountain
the traitor Ephialtes conduaecd a det~achment of Xer.,
zes's army, while the pass was heroically defendect
against the main body of the tyrant's forces by a
handful of brave Greeks, commanded by the gallant:
L~eoni da~s.~-Ota, where Herc ules burn t 'himfelf. -
Othrys, the country of the Lapithee.----Praffaius and
Elelipcon, in th~e dififria ofPhpcis : the former termnina.
ted in two tops·; the pne called .Nyfz, cpnfecrated to
Apollo ; the other Cyrrga, cqprecyated to Bacchus.
T~his mountain! overlyangs D)elphi, and in fable was re.
.puted th~e residence of the Muses. U eligon flood in

the neighbourhood of Parnassus, and 'was likewise, ac-
cording to the poets, very much frequented by the
Mvufes. On this mountain, arid within the grove of
the 191use-s, were the celebrated fountains Hypocrene
an d Alganippe. H~ere flopd the toqmb! of Orhpeus,
about which, accordipg to the ancient fabulifts, the
n::ghtingale delighted to build her ne~st. On the de-
clivity of Helicon were the towns of Thellepia, Nyff~a,
and Afera, where Hesiod was born.----Cithaer on in
Baeotia, consecrated to 15acchus. Certain Bacchanaliaq
revels were celebrated thert·.---Hymettus in Attica,
famfed ~for its delicious- honey, and beautiful niarble,
which was pepuliarly adap~ted For ftatpary.

The only river of note in Achala was Cephiffus,

divided into two branch~es; the one called A/opurs,
which separated the territory of Rpeotian T'hebes' froni
that of Megara g the other, I[menus, which runs near tpj
Th'ebes.

Achain contained eight diffrias; .1Etolia, Doris, Ls-

kpris, Ozolaea, P~hocis, Megaris, Attica, and Boeotia.

Chalcis, Olenus, and Calydon, were the chief towns

Rs .Jf~olia. In the neighbourhood of the latter was the

C=al -"

·"al~ydontian fore~t; famous for the chace of the Calydo-
nian boar, which was killed by Meleager.

Doris contained the towcns of Boinzm, Citinium, and

Pfindus.

·In Ozolian Loc-ris flood the town of Naupa~tus, now

called Lepanto, famous in modern times by the import-
-ant naval engagement between the Spaniards, VTenetians,
&c. commanded by Don John of Auffria, and the Turks,
in which the latter were defeated witih great slaughter.
.-I--n Epienemidian Locris were the towns C'nemides,
.Opus, and TIhronium.

The moif remarkable townms in Phocis were Anticyra,

Cyrrha, Pythia, and D~elphi at the bottomn of Mount
Parnaffias, where the council of the Acemphiftyons held
their deliberations, -but chiefly celebrated for the temple
and oracle of Apollo.,

In Megaris were the towtns of Megara and Eleutis.

The former gave its name to the country, and was the
birth-place of Euclid the philosopher, who was to pas-
fionate an admirer of the conversation of Socrates, that,
at the hazard of his life, on account of the war then,
subsisting between the Athenians and his countrymen,
hae Rtole into Athens dressed like a wroman, to listen to
that wvifeft of' philosophers.- Eleutis was consecrated to
Ceres, and was famnous by the celebration of certain
re~ligious rites in honour of that goddels, the most s~ecret
and folemnn of the multitude of religious ceremonies
obServed among the Pagan idolaters.

In Attica stood Athens. and . Marathon. Athenrs was

the most diftinguilhed city of all antiquity i--a name
that in everyxbreaft animated withithe love of literature,
and of the fine arts, kinidles the warmest fenfattions of
gratitude, admiration, and refpeft. The brigheft emat-
nations of genius, the most profound and ingenious
exertions of the human mind, displayed thems~elves in
this propitious spot. It was situated in the "nliddle of a.
beautiful and extensive plain, about forty miles south of
ThL~ebes, and at the f~ame distance to the north of the~
jith~mus of Corinth. It consisted of tw~o great divifionls,

leftirift part of which ftpod~ th~e Citadel. Tlhe latter ex-
ten'ded into the plain, and was called by the Greek
na~me of its ratelary deity Mi~nerva. One -co1mmon- wall
furrnun~ded bosh; ·and .dthens· became the general pante
of the united city., The rivers Ily~fus and Cephyfus

ea~ndered· through the plain on the east and wrest sides
of the city ; and. mingilingl their fireams, formed but one
river before they reached the sea. The temples, theatres,
and other public edifices at Athens, displayed all that
was admirable in statuary and architeflure. Beyond
and ajoining to the. suburbs were two celebrated ·walks,
which to remote~f potterity will be remembered with
veneration by every admirer of ancient philosophy. One
of them was in an ornamented garden, called Acardemus,
from the name of the man to whom i~t had originally
belonged .; and was frequented by Plato and his follow-
ers. In. she other, named the Lyeumrr, Ariffotle and
those ofi his school walkred and reasoned under the cover·
of a thady wood ; and were thence denominated Peripa-
teti~cs, or the -Walking Philosophers. ------ithin the ter-
ritory of Athens flood the sea-port towns, Phalera,
Maunichia, and Pyreus, all on the Saronick' bay, now
called the gulIph of Egina. Pyreus was the most con-
vPenient; and on that account was improved, enlarg-ed,
tand so rt ified, first by Therniffocks,1 an d a fterwa rds by
Periles. TPhough nearlyJ five miles difiant fi-rom Athens,
it was joined to that city by the means of two pro-
d~igious wealls about fixrty feet high, and thick in p, opor-
tion, which effe~tually prote~ted the commluication.

1Vavathon was famonus for, the vi'c~ory obtained by the

Greeks, ·commanded by the Athenian IViltiades, ovef
the numerous army of Darius.

Boeotia contained s~everal famous towLns. Theb~es, si-

tuated between' the rivers Afopus and Ifmenus. The
honour of founding th~is ciry is by fiome aferibed to Am-
phion; by others, to Phenician Cadmus, at the head of

pelopounefurs was divided into fix diffrifts; Achalar

properly so called, Elis, leLffenia, Arcadia, Laconia,
and Argis.,

Corinth was the chief city in Achaia, and flood in

th~e middle ojf the isthmus t~hat bears its name. Its cita-
del was built on a sleep and lofty hill, and was account..
ed imlpregnable by open force. T~he city had two har-
bourrs; Cenechrea, towards the Archipelago, whence
thEe Asiatic co~mmerce was carried on ; and Lecheucm,
rewards the Adrriatic, frequented by the veffJ-els em.
ployed in the trade of Italy and Sicily. Corinth was the
snmolt commercial town in all Greece, was very powerful
in4 naval stre-ngth, and acquired vast weahth by trade.
Next to Athens and Sparta it was the most considerable
slate in ancient G~reece. Lais, f'o celebrated for h7er-
beauty, was a native of Corinth. Ladies of her pro-
fef~ion found there uncommon encouragement and
protetlion. -Sicyon was likewise situated in Achaia,
:and was supposed to be the most ancient city in Greece.
plratus, who dift~iriguithed himself so highly as general
of the Achaean league, was a native of Sicyon.

Elis lies on the weffern coast of Peloponnef~us, having

Achaia to the north, and Arcadia and Messe~nia to the
/guth.e-----Oly mpia, likewise called Pisa, situated on

x h

the river Alpheus, was thne chief town in Elis.. H~elr
the Olympic games wkere celebrated. In its neigfhbour,
hood flood a rich temple of Olympian Jove, of which
the finest ornament was an ivory flamue of the god, ex.~
ecuted with exquisite art by the clelt-brated Phidiias.
,Cyllend', another city of Elis, was reputed to be the
birth-place of Mercury, thence called Cyllenius.

Mieffe~nia lay on the south- we ft coait of Pelopoune-

sus. It was accounted the most fruitful country of all
G~reece. ---Messene, Pylus, and Corone, were the
chief towns of Miffenia. Pylus was the country of
Neffor, so dilin~rgulfhed-in the Trojan war. This town
h~aving gone to decay, was, during the P~eloponnesian
war, rebuilt by the Athenians; who, abour the fame
time, took poffeilion of the island Sphafteria, on the
fame coait. The Athienian garrisons placed in Pylus
and Spha~teria, harralledl the Lacedemonians extremely
during that deftruative war.

Arcadia is a mountainous country, and forms the

centre of the Peloponnefus. T-'lhe towns of note in
this diffrift were, Tegea, Stymphalus, M/antinea, and
lPegalopolis. In the neighbourhood of M~antrinea was
fought the bloody battle between the Thebans and their
allies on onefide, commanded by Epaminandas, and
the Lacedemonians and Athenians, on the other. The
latter were defeated; but Epaminondas expired in the
arms of viatory. Megalopolisr was the birth place of
'Polybius the hifforian.

Laconia lay on the fopyth-eaft coait of Peloponnefus,

and bordered on Mleffenia and Arcadia. Its chief
city was Sparta; whos~e inhabitsfnts were equally dif-
tingulfhed by their bravery, and by the auff-erity of their
snanners. It was built on the weffern bank of the ri-
ver Eurotas ; which,, being seldom ford able, prote(5ed
the town on that fide. Though situated in a plain, it
contairf~ed several eminences within its circuit. It had
po walls. Gytheumn (tood at the mouth of the Eurotas,
pn the coast of the Archipelago, and was the chieffea-

p.9ri

port of Laconia.--In Laconia were likrewife the towne
of Leu~trum and Amychae.

Argis, also named Argolis, and Argia, lay on the

eastern coast of Peloponnefus ; and was bounded by Ar;
cadia on the weft, and by Laconia on the fouth.~---It
conta~in~ed the towns of Arg~os, Nemsea, Mvycenas, Nau-
plia, Tr~eemene, and E pidtaurus. Argos, thie capital,
flood on the banks of the river Inachus : In this city
Pyrrolus King of Epirus loft his life. Nemasa was si-
tuated between Argos and Corinth : Here the Nemse-
an games were celebrated irt honour of Hercules. 1Vy-
cense was the chief town of Agamemntot's kingdom,
and that king's roy al residence. Epidaurus was a ma-
ritime town, where there was a famous temple of .2S.I
fculaplus.

T'he seas which su~rround Greece are every where in41

terfperfedc with numberlels Ist.awas.

In the E~gean sea, we observe Euboea, Salamis, E.

gina, Sciro, Tenedos, Lemnos, Samothrace, Leibos,
and Chios.

Euboea is separated from the Continent of Boeotia by

a very narrow branch of the sea called Eulripusr. This
island is about 90 miles l'ongZ and 20 broad;I and is fruit-
ful in corn and -wine. A remarkable irregularity of'
the tides happens in the Euripus; from the 9th to the
25th~days of the moon, the se~a ebbs and flows there
twelve, thirteen, or fourteen times in the twenty-four
hou'rs, with a .most rapid current. Anciently Euboes~
containied two wealthy ·towns, Caryflus and chbalcis,
~Near the former were quarries of fine marble. Here
was fouind the afbeffos, a species of stone that may be
s~eparated into thin pliable threads, which the an-cients
wove into cloth. This cloth, when dirty, was put into
the fire, which purified it as water purities' linen, with-
out cons~uming it. Chalcis stands at the Euripus, op-
polite to Aulis in Boeotia. It was a very populous city,,
and sent out many colonies. Here Aristotle breathed his
left.~

S~ciros contained the tomb of Ther~eus. Here too,

ac-

according to the poets, Achilles was concealed amlong
the women of Lycomedes, prince of. the island, to a-
troid going to the ficege of Troy, where; it was foretold
he thou~ld be killed.

Tenedos was a little if land· not far from Troy.
Lemnos is of a square form, each fide being ·about

feren leag-ues long. Here, according .to the ancient
fabulifts, Vulcan fell when kicked out of heavers by Jul
piter. ~Hence Vulcan is denomi~nated Lemnzius 'Terr~a
3Lemnia, a produffion of this island, is a nlineral fa-1
fnous for its medicinal virtues. Fromn Lemnos Hio.
mer Opeaks of wine being sent to the Greeks when be-
sieging Troy.

Lelbos, about £eiventeen leagues in length and feren

in breadth, was. celebrated for its beauti-ful women, its
excellent wine, and its fertility. Its natives were ac,
counted fine fingfers. ~Mytilene was its chief town.-
Sappho the poeters, and Pittacus the sage, were natives
of Leibos.

The wine ofChlos was likewise highly efleemed. It

was. the ne~ear of: the ancients. This inland is about
fourteen leagues in circumference. The women of
Chrios were ulncom-monly beautiful.

_.-Egina, ~also called ;cnone, lay in the Saronick bay

between Attica and Megaris. Being· a powerful naval
RIate is the' neighbourhood of Pircus, the harbour of
Athens, .it excited the jealousy· of the Athenians; -who
havng. quarrelled with the JEginetre, passed a laws one
of the most barbarous that occurs in hiffory, ordaining
the thumbs of fach of them as fell- into their hands to
be cut ofE, to disable them from working at the oar.

Salamis, the kingdom of Telamon, father to Ajaxr and

Teucer, was famous by. the important viatory obtained
in its neighbourhood by the Grecian fleet over that of
Xerxes.-----The Athenians fuffered so severely by a long
firuggle with the Miegarenfians about this island, that,
at length, they entirely relinqulfhed the attempt, and
declared it capital for any person to propose a renewal
of the enterpris~e. But Solon, sensible of the great ad-

vantage

Arantage which the Athenians might derive from havlniti'
the command of the island, composed verses to ithead
them to. recommence the: attempt. To avoid the pu-
niihment enafted by the law just mentioned, he affeRa
ed to be mad ; and, in that charader, ran through the
Gtreets deelaiming his verses with great vehemence.
The firatagem fucceededi and his countrymen recover-'
ed the island.

. The C'ycladel, a cluffer of twelve little islands, lyiing
in a circular fo-rm, as the name imports, round Delois
and the Sp~o~rads, another colleAion of small islands,;
more distant from one another, and Ecattered round the
Cyclades, lie more near to the entry of the J~gean sea,
towards Clrete. -- --- Of the Cyclades, the mott c~onfi-
derable was Aindros, in the treig~h~borrrhood of Eabeza ;
Delos, and Pa~ros famous for its beautriful marble ;-'
~Delos, from: what tEhe ancients have wrlittn of it,
thould seem to have been s~uddenly p~ro-duced by some
violent convulsion in the earth occartioned by an earth·e
quakg #. According to poetical fable, Delos was
the birth-pl)ace of Apolto' and Dianaw; the children of
Latorra. It contained a river called Cynthias, whe~rfe
Apollo. is sometimes called Gynthius, and D~iana Gy/n-
thia. MP~any Corin~thia~n m~erchants, after the deftruc-
tion of thei~r native city by the Ronnans, were induced
to fettle at D~el~os on account of its cnonentint harbour';
-··; Of the Sporades, the most considerable islands
were Icaria, Patmos, Samos, Cos, and Carpathus.
Samos is situated opposite to Ephesus, at the difiance
of about fix miles from the commien~t of Asia Minor.
It is .ab~out ten leagues long, and' five broad·. Pytha~-
goras was born here. Juno too was accobnted a na-
tive of Samos. Cos was the` birth-place of the painter'
A~pelles, and of the Prince ofPhyficians Hippocrates.

In the lonian sea, the chief islands were Corcyra, Ce'-

phalenias

*) In. the year tyoy, three or four islands were, by a flmilar convuT-

fron, producetd in the mot) southerly part of the Archipelago. T9he
largft~ of there is called Santorin, and is about ten leagues in cir-curnfe-

Phaeaca:, and the gardens of Iging Alcinous, in Corcyra;
14ere the Corinthians established a colony about half a
century before Solon's tim~e.- --Anthony, Cicero's
colleague in the conf'ulate, was bzanithe~d to Cephatenia,
where he laid the foundations o~of a new town.-TheK
inhabitants of Zacynthuls were an effeminate race, e-
nervated by luxury, the ·consequence of their w~ealth.
- -Ithaca, situated to the ·east of Cephalenia, -is chiefly
diftinguilhed by being the kingdom and the reSidence
of Uly fles,

Crete, the largest of all the ifiands which surround

Grceece, lies beyond the entry into the JEgean.f~ea. It
is reckoned to be about 2oo miles long and 6o broad.
It produced corn and fruit in great plenty, and was fa-
mous for its excellent wine. Its inhabitants, reputed,
with much probability, to have been originally a Phe-
nician colony, were anciently a warlike people. They
had good cavalry; and were expert at the bow, and in
naval engagements. -Trheir laws were much admi-
red by the Greeks; and the memory of their legislator
Minos was highly venerated.- Tlhe Cretaus af~ter-
wards degenerated extremely, and became infamous
for their piracy anid volnptuoufnef~s.----Gortyna, Cy-
dion, and Gno~Fus, were the chief cities of Crete : and
Ida and Dikhe were its most remadcable mountains. It
had no rivers of any note. ~

The large islands of Cyprus and Rhod~es are 11tuated

in the eattern extremity of the M/editerranean sea; but
anciently were not numbered among the Grecian ifiands.
T~he former lies about 3o miles weft of the coast of Syria,
and is about 15o miles long and 7o broad. Rhocdes isa
only about sch miles difiant from the coalt of Caria in
Asia Mmnor. It is about So miles long and so broad.

The ancienit Greeks ~eat: out many colonies, parti-

cularly to Italy, to Sicily, and to Asia M~inor. In thie
last mlentzoned country, these colonies poffeffed a large
traft of country along the sea-coast, diftinguiifhed into
three provinces, Eolia, lonia, and Doris.

Eolia

.-Eolia lay -on the' coast of the 1Eg~ean sea, having th(C
province of Troas or Lrittle Phrygi~a to the north, and
lopia to the south. IV~ore anciently,- and before the Eou
lians f'etled there, it wpas called 1VMyfia. Ti~he cities
of chiief note in this province were Cuma, Paocea, and
Elea. ·Cuma was reported to have been founded by3

t'he coalt b~etween th:e rlivers Cayfter: ansd Mdeand er.
Its principal- ornam-ent was the renowned templ~e of
D~iana, one of ·the mroit magnifient ed'ifies· thiat ever
the world saw.

~Doris lay to the- fiurth of lonaia Hali~carnafiuss and:

Cni~dus were it's two principal cities. Herodotus, t~e~
Father of` HZiffory, wa·s a nI~ativye of th~e former; but

Temoved, with a colony of his countrymen, to Thu-
Iriuml in Italy. Here too D'irnyflus, surnamed the
Halicarnafian, was born. At Cnidus there was a fta-
tue of Venus of inestimable value, executed by the fa-
xnous Prabxitiles. Cnidus too was the birth-place of
Ctefias the physician; who havirig accompanied Cyrus
the younger in his unnatural expedition againf1 his bro-
ther Artaxerxes, was· nade prisoner at the battle of
Cunaxa,. and remained at the Perfiarn court fevenreen
years. In this period he is said to have written a vo-
luminous hiffory of the Persians and AsSyrians #.

The Pelafgi, who, by their own account, derived

their descent· from Pelafgus, are, on probable grounds,
supposed to have been the most ancient inhabitants of
G~reece m~entioned in tradition.

The Greekss,in their more early times, were, like every

other people, a savage race, utterly ignorant of agriculture ;
and they paid divine hionours to Pelafgus, who had taught
them to feed on acorns, .asafodga more solid and
fabffantial nourithiment than herbs and roots.

It appears, that they bore originally the name of

Greeks: which however they soon loft; for Hellenz, the
son of Deucalion king of Lycia, having subdued the
Peloponnese, called the people after his ownm name,
H~elenes, and the country its~elf Hellas.

Acheus and lon, grandsons of Hellen, became the

chiefs of two tribes ; the former, of the Acheans, who
inhabited Aebaia; and the other, of the lonians, who
poffeffed the territory called afterwards Lacedemon.

Ealu~s anda Dorrs, likewise two descendents of -Hel-

len, were in the fame manner chiefs of two other tribes
called after their names i Ealus of the Ealians, wh~o,

C under

*3 ICtefias, in his hiffog, se~ems to have differed in various particulars

from ~Herodotus~, whose accuracy he aff~edted to question. C~tefias too
was himself filfpe~ted by the pofttrior Gr-eek- writers, and by Plutarch
among the reft, both of credulity in his hifforical r-ese·arches, and of va-
nifyr as to what related to himf'elf. But as Herilodotus, as well as Cte-
fias, wrote principally from tradition, they may have been both milin-
formed : and from their disagreement, as well as from the nature at
things, we may perceive how little credit is due to the history of rem~ote
nations andl ages nototherwife fiupported th~an by~ tra~ditionl

IN order to treat this hiffoty in a more difftinat mid

inethodical ~nainetj we ihall divide it into fou~r arges or
periods, iticluditig, altogether, a space of i 94 4 years.

'Pelopon~nefian· tar to the death of Al~exander the Great

The fourth and last age eftends from the death of

~Alexander the Great to the fishne when Gree'te became
ad Roman provincei so~on after the defiru~tion of Co-
rnoth, about the year r 46, a Opace of about r77 years.

The end ofthe~ hiftery of Greece is, by other writers,

extended to the period of the elitin~tion of the g-overn-
Inent of the Selencidsi~ irt Asia, by Potinpegi the Great,
in the year before Christ 65: ·sAnd, by some authors, it
is even extended to the time that the race of the Lagidae
fadled in Egypt, in the person of the famous Cleopatra,
when that country was reduced into the form of a Roman.
province by Aulguitus Caesar, in the year after Christ 30.

To the whole thall be fubjloined an account of the

xuoft memorable tranfaations in Greater Greece, which
comprehended, as we have alreadv observed, the island~
of Sicily, and a considerable part of the prrefet kring-

Greece. It presents at first to our vIew a
country divided into several small pruxcxpah*~
ties, such as the kingdoms of Sicyon, of A-

thens, of Sparta, of Thebes, &c. which are thought to
have been refpeftively founded by different cotomies of
Egyptians and Phenicians. In the next plac~e, it corn-
prehends the heroic times, under which are placed the
expedition of the Argonlauts, the cruelty of the Da-
naides, the labours of Hercules, the siege of Thebes,
the siege of Troy, and other ancient events, which have
been greatly difgulfed by the fables of the poets. For
the whole mythology, and the various metamorphofes
wi~th wuhich their works shound, are nothing else than
the evenlts of the ancient Greek hiffory, disfigured and
transformed by the licentious marvellous of those firit
poets. The colonies juff now mentioned contributed to hu-
nnanize and soften. the savage manners of the original
;Greeks. Of the Phenicians they lPearned navigation

and commerce; and of the' Egyptians, laws, religion,
the rudiments of the fine arts, and bodily exercises.

The Greekss, gradually emerging from barbarism, ac-

quired ~by deg~rees juffer notions of.every.'thing. Each
individual beg~an to regard his family as a member of the:
slate, and his native country as a commnon mother.
Hence they soon became sensible of the necefirty and
nature of government. At: first the regal power gene-
rally prevailed. But in process of time mafit of the itates
af~umed the republican form of government; which, as
it opens a way for every the lowest member to arrive at
honiours and ofi~ces, begets in the breasts of the citi-
ztens a more than ordinary love of their country. " The
offices of trust, too, in s~uch a government, being com-
monly confined in their duration to a year, or some such
thort sp~ace, could hardly be converted to any bad pur-
pole by those who poffeffed them, fenfiblb how soon they
mnuft resign them and returia to a level with their fel-
low-citizens, and that they were obliged to render a
'firift: account of their adminiffration. Besid-es, their
labor~ious course of life, chiefly [pent in the· cultivation
off the ground, preserved them, in a great measure,
from the more hurtful and~ vicious paffons, and~ mnain-
tained a certain degree of equality among all the ment·-
Bers of the slate. Hence simplicity and sobriety, with
their concomitant virtues, were holden in honour and
efitcm. Such were the Greek~s during this first age,
and the greater part of the second.

CHP AP. S,.I

2 genevral a~ccunt of the ancient princi~palities of Greece-,

fromt their- earlie/2 times till thJe aboli~tion of the king~ly
government in all but Sparta.

THIE hiffory of the first ages of Greece is,· Ilike that

of the beginnings of all other nations, involved in

almost impenetrable obciurity. This obsc~urity gives

room53

room for fiftion ; which, while it fills up the total blankr
of remote antiquity with imaginary events and revolu-
tions, disguises at the fame time, and embehlifhes, the
few real occurrences of later times of which some re-
membrance was still preserved, in such a manner that
they become marvellous, unnatural, and incredible.

Somne learned men have laboured to diftinguiih fa&

from fable in this indigetted chaos; and their invefti-
gations furnish evidence of their extensive reading, and
frequently, though not always, discover much discern·-
ment and ingenaity. But this is all the praise that can
be given them. For a sagacious and attentive reader
ge~neraely perceives their theories to be directed by some
particular bias, and finds their deduaions mnconclufive
and unfatisfa~tory.

But the unavoidable ignorance of the more ancient

hiffory of nations, though lit may be matter of regret
* to philosophers, is no material loss to other readers.

For what useful information could have been thence de-
rived, even if their tranfa8~ions had been faithfully re-
co -d~ by writers who had lived in those times ? We
tho~ld peruse but the annals of various tribes of s~~ava
ges, roaming about from place ·to place as accidents di.
rear them, struggling with the seas~ons, and with their
brotlher- beafls, and governed in their pursuits by imme-
d-ia~te necessity rather than by rational design. To the,
philosopher, who desires to trace mnan from the brute
slate to that of society, such a h~ilt~ory might be useful;
but to other readers it would afford little infiru~2ion,
and less entertainment. M~ankind in this Rtate thould
fTeem to be a fitter f~ubjea~ for natural philosophy than for
history.

The ancient poets of Greece were likewis-e its first

historians, The famte has been the cafe w~ith most other
nations. The objeat of those poets having .been to
please and to surprise rather than to confine themselves
to the plain narration of matters of fast~, their deferip-
tions are wonderful past all bounds of credLibility, and

C 3 .ex-

exhibit a motley medley of miracles, moniters, demi.
gods, and heroes.

W~e thould therefore very willingly have omitted to

take any notice of the absurd fables of the more ancient
hiffory of Greece, were not the knowrledge of them nel
ceti~ary to those who peruse the writings of the ancients,
which otherwise mIUft in many places prove totally un-
Intelligib~le. For this reason alone we proce~cd- to this
ilifagreeable and difguffing talk; which, however, we
tlhall diikuf~s with all pofibl~e brevity.

Greece, in its more ancient times, was divided into

there s~even sm;all kingdoms or principalities ; ~Sicyou,
Argos, lMycene, Thebes, Corinth, Sparta, and Athens.
Of each of these in its order.

'THE kingdom of Sicyon took its name

3'O Io from Sicyon, a towrn of the Peloponnese, Ii- *

tuated near the ifthtnys of Corinth, and by

some accounted the most ancient city in Greece. Egite
aleus is mecntioned as its firlt king; but hifforians are
not agreed about the number of his fueceffrors. Ind eed
this kingdom never poffeffed much powvrer, ixor made
any considerable figure.

W~e cannot speak with any tolerable certainty of the

<other ftnall kingdomns eftabrlifhed about the fame time
wbith that of Sicyon.

A Rco a.$

THE principality of Argos surpassed both in

r856. power and wealth that of Sicyon. Thafe names

of its kings that occur in hiffory are these: Ina-

chus, Phoroneus, Apis, Ar~gus, Criafus, Phorbas, Tri-
opas, Erotopus, Sthenelus, G-elanor, Danaus, Lynceus,
.Abas, Praetuni, Acriflus.

Phor-oneus end~eavoured to humanize his f~ubje £ts, in-

~Fluencing their minds by the terrors of religion, and

·their aftions bi· the restraint of laws. He gained feve-
-ral adivantages over the Arcadians in wrar, and reduced
·the Peloponne~se uinder his power. Arguts, from whorn
the chief city of the kingdom derived its name, is rec-
~koned the first who yoked oxen in the plough. Criafus
was the fitrt who dedicated altars to the godders Juno.
Isachus is famous for `being the father of 10, wHho has
Safforded To much matter for poetical fi~tion.

Here ocecurs the fEablF· of thbe Dianaides, told in s~ub-

flance thus. Egyptus King of Egypt having fifty sons,
.resolv~ed to marry them to the like number of daughters
of his brother Danaus; who, to avoid the alliance, fled
to Argos. I'he ship in which he trans~ported himself
was the firff of any confidserable size that had appeared
on the coasts of Gr-eece. Upon arriving at Alrgos, he
claimed the crown, as being a de~scendant of Epaphus ;
and was on that footing preferred to Gelanor, who was
then in poffefiion.0f it. Egyptus, in the mre~an time,
apprehenfilve lefti DIanaus thould be~come too powerful
by the alliances he might procure from the marria~ges of
hris fifty daughters, difpatchied his fifty sons at the head
of an army, to inf~it on the daughters receiving them
for husbands. Their uncle D~anaus, finding himself
soli~cited in so forcible a manner, was obliged to con-
sant; but he privately persuaded his daughters to mur-
der their refipedive husb~ands the first night of their
marriage; a most thocklng cruelty,- which there daugh-
ters, however, were not afraid to perpetrate. Linceus,
the huiband of the daughter named Hypermneflra, a-
lone eifeaped this horrible mailacre. This flory is absurd
and incredibtle.

A~criflus a~nd Praetus, two twin-brothers, and sons of

Lincess,difputed the kingdom with each other; but came
to an agreement at last; whereby the crown of Argos
was reserved to Acriflus; and Tlirinthus, with some 0-
ther places, were yielded to Praetus. This Acriflus was
the father of the beautiful Danae, s~o celebrated by the
poiets, Acrifius having been warned by an oracle, that
hlis gran~dson thouald occasion his death, placed his daugh-

C 4 ter

ter in close confinement. But a prince, named Ju~piter,
bribed her guard, gained admittance into the tower

wherein the was confined, and married her.

2 36r. Perseus was the fr-uit of this clandestine mar-

riage.

Many wonderful a~tions are alcribed to this Perseus.

H~e is said to have destroyed monters ;--to have killed
NIVedufa, wcho is believed to have been a queen in A-
frica, whole kingodom he conquered ;-- and` to have re-
fcued Andromeda from a fear monst~er that is to sTay,
from s~ome perfan1 who was to have carried her away iri
a thip. Petrfeus coming at last into Theffialy, to be pre-
ferit at certain pub)ic· gam~es, krilled Acriflus by acci-
d~n t.

AtSbout the f~ame time EPelops, the son of Tantalus king

of Phrygia, having married Hippodarnia, the daughter
of Genomlaus king of Pis~a, succeeded his father-in-law
in hIs kingdoml and$ reign-ed veryl long. ]He made
himself master of thf-e Peloponnese, and had a vast
number of' descendents, famous in the. hiffory of
Greece, where they are distinguished by the name of~
Pe·lopide~.

P~erseus transferred the throne of Argos to

I13$44 Mycene, and gave the city of Argos to his son

Anaxagoras, who was the father of a pretty

long race, by whom he was s~ucceeded in that principa-
lity. TPhe reign of Perseus was of fifty-eight years du-
ration, and afforded him LFfuficient time for est~ablishing
on a firmi foundation his new kingdomn of Miycene. T~the
names of his successors were, Stehelneus, Eurystheus,
Atreus, Thyefies, Agamemnon, Egifteus, Orefles, Ti-.
~famenes.

IEt was Eurystheus who imposed on H-ercules the

twelve labours so much exaggerated by fable. It
seems to be admitted by hifforians,. that several heroes
existed, in dif~ferent nations, under this name of H~er-
cules, wrhich appears to have been a general appel~la-

tion beltowed on thos~e who distinguished themselves
by extraordinary feats of valour. But in the end, the
-exploits of all the reft were, by the Grecian fabulifts,
appropriated to their own countryman, who was the
son of Alemena by Amphytrion, or, as the poets will
have it, by Jupiter, the chief of the gods; but: who
truly has been fomne neighbouring prince of that name.
Eurystheus, from a jealousy of the bravery of Hercules,
engaged him ini several ·dangerous enterprises, wherein
he hoped he might perish, There enterp~rises have in
fanble obtained the name of the frtoel~ve labours; and are:
there rendered romantic, past all bounds of'probabilrity.
T he Nemean lion, and the seven headed hydr~a, must
Scertainly have been robbers or murderers extirpated by
· Hercules : For in thos~e early ages, persons of extraor-
ainary courage travelled about in search of great ad-1
gventures, s~omething irn the manner of our .modern
k~night s- erran t.

The expedition of the Argonauts must be

placed about this time. Jason, a young prince x 263,
~'of Tlheffaly, was initigated to this undertaking
by his uncle Pelias ; who having usurped his throne, ho-
ped that his nephew might fall in the expedition. The
enterprise "was deemed so bold and hazardous, that the
bravest men in Gi=reece thought themselves bound in
honour to participate in the glory of it. Hercules there-
for,, with Caffor and Pollux, Theleus, Peleus, Laertes,
and Telamon, accompaniedJafon in the expedition; toge-
ther with Argus, by whose direaion the ship that t'ranf-.
ported them to Colchos was confiruated,and which on that
account was narned Argo. There intrepid adventurers
pa~ssed through the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the
'Thracian Bosphorus into the Euxine sea, which they
traversed to the mouth of the river Pharus in the teri-o
tory of Colchos at the most: eafterlyr extremity of that
sea. Though too few to proceed by open force, and
too distinguIshed, according to the ideas of modern
(mres, to ;aft basely ; yet it seems to be certain, that

wIealth

weakh was on this occafian the obje~t of those Grecian
heroes; and that the vast treasu~res of Etes, a prince of
that clountry, was the -prize at w5hich they aimed. The
adventurers accordingly fucaeeded in their enterprise,
and that too without any blood being spill; for Mfedea,
the daughter of Etes, having fallen in love with Jafpn,
purt him ~in poffpiion of all h~er father's waealth, to induce
him to marry h/er. This MEvldge~ became afterwards fa-
seous -by her flkill in sorcery, and infamsous byr her
wIick.ednefs,l-The~ poets have been pleased to assign a.
golrden fleege, which was guardeds by a. drag~on, for the
objeEU of thit3 expedition, and to dack the Ror-y in sho~wy
fables; and the· voyage waas at that timne judged to be so
dangerous and wonderful, that one of thle brighteit
con~te~lations~ in the heavess was called Argao, after the
8same of the ihip.

king of Teges, the red of his kindred were obliged to

with his wife Europa, he first banithed him ; but after-~
wards havring recalled him, he killed Thyefiesu's son PEe-
Slops, and served up the fleih of his body as a dith to his
father. This faij, howiever, depends on no better au-
thorityr than thqt of the poets, and may therefore be juftr
ly enough called in queion., Eqt it has neverthetefis
furrufhed fubjea for the Tragic IMife, both its ancient
and modern times. A gamemnaon, son of Flif thenes,
pnd grandson of Atreus, is supposed to have been the
successor of Atreus in the kingdom of Argos and My-
Fene. Agamemnon was a very powyerful prince, and
on that account was chosen commander in chief of the
Grecian forces in the war against Troy.

C3AorUs, a native of Egypt, and the Son of

Adgenor, is reckoned the first king of Thebes. I499,
1Jnder pretence of seeking for his fiffer, who had
been carried off by a prince called Jupater, he led a co-
lony of Phenicians into Greece, and founded that city.
Cadmu~s is said to have introdu1Iced into Greece the Phec
sucian alphabet. The invention of letters, which· is
generally attributed to the Phenicians, is the moll won-
Wierful, and the mort ofeful, of all the invenitions of
snan.----The successors of Cadsmuslwere, Polydore, Labt
dacus, and Lycus.

In the time of the last of there, Amnphion and Zethus

anade themselves snafters of 'Thebes, and pffulmed the
obvereign power. Amsphio~n being a man of a mild dif-
polition, and very eloquent, perfoaded the Thebans vo-
Zntalrily to confirm him and his colleague in the royrality,
and likewis~e to take more effettual measures for the dec
ifence of their city. Tisbi, no doubt, has given occaiion
to th~e poetical fable, of Arnphion having built the walls
of Th~ebes by the music of ~his lyre. His reign, however,
was but of sh~ort duration ; for Lains, the son of Labda-
pus, soon recovered the kingdom.

ataus having married ;a lady called f0caffa, wnas

t~old

toldl by the oracle, that the son the brought him
th~ould occafiion his death. As soon therefore as thae
boy was born, he ordered him to be expoted. But
ifone thepherds found the child, sav~ed him from peritlh-
Ing, and called him Oedipus. Happening, when grown
up, to meet with his father in the country of Phocis, he
quarrelled with the old man, and flew him, without
knowing him to be his father. Creon, thereupon, the
brother of Jocaffa, usurped the crown.

Here the truth of the Theban hiffory is disfigured8

and disguised by the fables of the poets. They tell us,
that at sphinx appeared on the sea-shore, proposed a
riddle~ to all paiffengers; and devoured thos~e that could
not tolve it. Creon ordered proclamation to be made
through all Greece, that he would beltow the kingdom
of Thy·bes, together with its queen Jocaffa, on the man
thait thould solve the fphinx's riddle. O)edipus under-
took- the business; and on being afkred by the s~phinx,
W,:mt was th~e animal that wzgalked in the morningq on four
fe~et, at naoon on tswo, and at nig~ht on three:' he answered,
That it was man; alluding to his being able only to
·crawl about in early infancy, to walk in mauhood,
and to fopport himself in old age with a ftalf. The
sphinx, enraged at finding her riddle underflood, threw
herself in~to the sea. Oedipus, as the reward of his in-
genuity, received Jocaafa in marriage, and the ksing-
dom of Thebes for her dowry. A violent plague ··ux.~
mrrediatel-y desolates Boeotia; and the oracle being ap-
plied to on the occasion, gives for answer, that it would
-continue to rage till the murderer of Laius were banish-
ed. After much inq'uiry, the myltery is discovered.
Oedipus perceiving that he is not only the murderer of
his father, but the husband of his own mother, is firuck
with the utmost horror, and in difpair plucks out his
eyes, or, more truly, perhaps, banishes hims~elf from
the fight of his fubje~ts by a voluntary ·retirement; and
Jocaffa, in an exce~ss of grief, fkrangles hers~elf. TLhe
tragic poets, in all ages, have found this a proper fubr
jett on which to excrcife .their muse.

4 Eteocles

Eteocles and Polinices, the unhappy fruits of`

the incestuous marriage of Oedipus and his mo- I225*
ther, soon became famous for their mutual ani.
mofity and hatred -of each other. In this dilpofi·-
tion they both aspired to the throne; and could find no
other mean of reconcilement, than by agreeing to reign
alternately, each a year at a time. But Eteocles having
been first pr-eferred to the regal dignity, on account of
his being the elder brother, refused, upon the expiry
of his year, to resign the throne to Polinices. The lat-
ter, ,upon this, implored the afir~tance of Adrailus king
of Argos ; who not only joined hiar himself, but soon
formed a powerful confederacy in his favolur, and im.
mediately declared war against Eteocles. Thebes, ac-
cordingly, is besieged under the conduat of seven fa-
mous commanders, Adrastus, Polinices, Tydeus, Am-
phiaraus, Capaneuts, Hypomedon, and Parthc-nopleus.
Of there commanders the greater part perilhed mn the
course of the siege; which, after occasioning thr effix-
sion of much ·blood, wxas at last relinquifhr-d, Etocles
and Polinices having terminated the contest by a single
combat; wherein they fought with fach desperate fury,
that they both fell. This siege of Thebes is reckoned to
have preceded that ·of Troy about thirty years.

After the death of the two brothers, the sons of the

seven commanders who had conduffed the siege re-
solved to revenge the deaths of such of their fathers as
had been killed in it. With this view they ·laid waste
Boieotia, and came to an engagemient with the; Th'ebans*
who having loss their king in the battle, abandoned
their aity ; of which the Epig~onoi, the name given to
there s~even chiefs, immediately tookr pof~efi~on.

The sequel of this period of the Tlheban hiffory is no

less uncertain and obscure than its beginnilng. Xanlthus
is thought to have been their last king, the govern,
.Inent on his death having becorne republican.

left a huntierous posterity, known by the name of Bat-
Ethide; who, after a confiderfable nltervsal, during which
several revoltitiotus happen~ed in the kingdomj engrossed
the whojle power of the slate, and rendere~d the govern-
aneint ariftockaitial.

f n this interval Corinth hIad at~t-ired at ad co~nsiderable

but even his own wife. His great intercourse, how;
ever, with the philosophers o~f those times, and the phi-
lofophical spirit wvhich, notwithstanding the cruelty of
his nature, he himself poa·ffefed, procured? him a plact
am~ong the s~even sages of Gr~ece ; an honour from
which his critnes ought to have excl~uded him. Uponi
his death the Corinthians, wecary of being ruled by an
ablolute prince, relolved to alter the form of govern-
anent f-rom monarchy to democracy; and having, with
that view, freed themsel~ves of the remaining branches
of the royal family, they afferred their natural liberty,
and eftabliihed the popular government.

Tros. Priam,Ir isaft ksing, had arrived at a veiy high
pitch of wealth and power. He was the father of fifty
sons ; the wall's of Troy were rebuilt by him * he
changed the name: of the town to Pergamus; and reign-
ed for many years with great prosperity.

In the mean time Que~en ~Hecuba, Priam's second

'Priam was to muc~h alarmed, that he. ordered' the child
of whom the queen was big, and who happened to be
a boy, to be exposed as soon as born. ~The child was
named ParisJ; and, notwithstanding the order of his fa-.
ther, was, by the care of Hecuba, preserved, and pri·-
vately eduicated. W~hen grown up, he appeared at
court, where his beautiful person attrafted general ad-
Iniration. Upon this he ventured to discover hims~elf to
Priam; who was so delighted with his figure and accom-
plithments, that he thought no more of the dream. Pa-
s-is soon after undertook an expedition into G~reece, on
pretence of recovering his aunt ]Elefione', who, when
very young, had been carried away by Hercules, and
by him had been gliren ini marriage to Telamon. It may
not be improper to mentiori the occasion of this rape.

Ltaomnedon, the father of' H-esione, had applied the

treas~ures of· the temples of Neptune and Apollo to build
the walls of Troy, un~der a promise of repaying the
sums so abfftrated. IBut being either unable or unwil-
ling to discharge his promifie, the oracle declared that he
could no other wife expiate the sacrilege,~ than ·by expo-
sing ·a Trojan virgin to a fe~a-monifers Helion was
condemned by lot to undergo this punirihment. Her-
cules, however, flew the monfler, and rescued H1efiond.
It is, w~ell known howl much this event has been dit-
guised by the fiftions of the poets.

Paris, upon his arrival at Sparta, was received in the

most kind and hospitable manner' by MIenelaus, who
had succeeded to that kingdom in the right of his wlife
Helen, the daughter of 1 yndarus. But Paris falling
in love with Helen, prevailed vbit~h her to run away with
him, and thereby plunged his country into an abyss of
mistortunes.

W~e may, however, trace the cause of the Trojan

war to a higher source Htill, and attribute it to an here-
ditary animosity that had long fublifted between the si-
milies of Agamemnon and Priam. For Tantalus kirig
of Phrygia, and g~reat-gra\ndfather, of Agam~emnon, ha-

ving violently carried off Ganymede, brother of Ilus
the grandfather of Priam, Ilus- had takren venlgeance for
this injury, by stripping Ta~ntalus of his dominions,
and had obliged him to take refuge in Greece, where
his son Pelops and his des~cendents eftablifted them,
selves under the name of Peloidae. Be this as it may,
I~ienelaus, fired with indignstion at the insult com~-
mnitted against him by Paris, persuaded his brother A-
~gamemnon to espouse his quarrel; and by their joint
efforts, the two brothers brought all the other powers
of Greece to unite in the fame cause, and to bind
themselves by oath, either to recover Helen, or to ruin
Troy. Agamnemnon was chosen comzmander in chief
of this grand confederacy.

~Aulis was the- general rendezvous of the Grecian

forces; who, when afi~mbled there, composed all toge-
ther an army of I00,000 men. The fleet defined to
carry -them to Troy, consisted of about r ' 5 vessels.
The galleys of Boeotia carried each m 20 men, and those
of Philoftetes 50. I here veffl~s had no deck, but were
made like open boats. Of the chiefs who accommpaniect
this army, the molt famous were, Agamemnon, MIene-
laus, Diomnedes, Neffor, Aijax son of T'elamon, Ajax son
of Oileus, Achilles, his friend Patroclus, Ulysses, &c.

The Greekrs having landed on the plains of

Troy, soon perceiv~ed that the Trojans were as I;93.
brave a- people as themselves. Ulysses and
Mlenelaus were sent to Priam to demand the restitution
of Helen. But that prince, in opposition to the opinion
of his council, having refused to comply with their re-
quest-, both parties made vigorous preparations for war.

The Greeks, after uefeating the Trojans in two dif-

ferent enga"gements, found themselves under the necef-
fity of dividing their forces, the more easily to procure
provisions, of which they begfan to be in great want.
'This gave leifore to the Trojans to negociate with the
neighbouring sl~ates for aiftance. Achilles, in the mean
time, who commanded the detachment of te army sent
out in search of provilions, performed many figrnal e~xi

D . ploits 3

ploits; took several towns, and made a vast booty.
But the crueltyp of the Greeks to Palamuedes, one of
theirr bravelt officers, whom they put to death upon a
false accufatiori of treason brought against him by U-
lyffe~s, io provoked Achilles, that he refus~ed to give
them further afif~t~ance in the war, and separated his
troops- from the reft of the army.

The nine first years of the war were consumed in va.

r~ious engagements of no great importance; the Greekis
having in that time employed themselves chiefly ux
ravaging the territories of Priam and his allies. It is
therefore true, that the eroar of Troy: continued ten
years : but it is not: true, as is commonly believed, that
the city of Troy wags befe~ged all that space; for it was
not: till the [pring: of the tenth year that the Greeks form-
ed the siege. They at fidit experienced the most vigo-
rous resistance on the part of the besieged, who were!
commanded by Heaor, Delphobus, J7fneas, &c. and
by several princes that had come to their afif~tance,
fach as Sarpedon, G3laucus, Rhzefus, Mlemnon. The
Trojans had even the advantage in several engagements,
and made a great slaughter of the Greeks; but none of
these saions was decisive. At last, however, He~tor,
at the head of the Trojans, beat the enemy fairly from
the field, pursued them to their camp, forced the en-
trenchments, and set fire to their thips ; and via~ory
seemed at last on the point of declaring for the Trojans.

But Patroclus, the friend of ~Achilles, perceiving the

extreme diffre~fs of the Geteks, advanced in this critical
moment to their relief with the troops of Achilles, ree-
koned the bravest of the. Grecian army, rallied the
G~reeks, ·and repulsed the Trojans. Several of the best
officers on both sides· fell on this occafian; amnongit the
rpeft Sarpedon slain by Patroclus, and Patroclus him-
self slain by the hand of He~or. Affairs now affirme
a different appearance. Achilles, furious for the loss
of his friend, and forgetting the former caule~ of his re-
fentment, joins his forces to the reft of the Grecian
army, beats the Trojans, and sacrifices on the tomb of

P~at-

Patroclus twelve of the noblest prisoners taken by
him in the engagement. He: is now solely intent on
fighting personally with Heaor; whom he engages, and
kills at last., But, not s~atisfied with the death of his
gallant enemy, he fidflies the glory of his viatory by in-
f~ulting, in the most ungenerous and savage manner,
over his dead body, which he drags at his chariot- wheels
around the city. Achilles himself is slain soon ·after by
Paris ; who in like manner falls in a thort time by the
hand of Philo~tetes.

The Trojans having now loft their best commanders,

reposed their last hope on the famous Palladium, a fla.
tue of Minerva, said to have dropt into their city direatly
from heaven ; it being a received opinion, that while
this ftactue remained within: the walls of Troy, the city
could never be taken. At length, however, Antenor
and JZ~neas are reported to have treacherously delivered
it to the Greeks, and at the fame time to have betrayed
the city by throwing the gates open to the enemy in
the night. But s~ome authors fay, that the Greeks
took Troy by surprise. As for the wooden horse, by
means of which the Greeks, ac~cording to the poets,
made themnfelves matters of the city, it thould seem to
be a mere chimera of poetical fancy-, or, perhaps, some
machine resembling a horse, which the Greeks may·
have ofed in the siege, to make a breach in the wall, by
whitch they gained admittance into the town. It is,
however, an agreed point, that the Greeks took the city
in the night ; put Priam and all his family to death; and
after plundering the town, set it on fire. The
takringf of Troy is the most celebrated epoch in Ixr 84.
the biftory of the Greeks; and indeed this war
may be said to have affobrded the first public display of
Grecian valour. It is likewise worth remarking, that
the misfortunes of Troy have furnithed the fubjea of
the two most perfedt epic poems in the world, the Iliad
and the J~neid.

Menelaus alone, by recovering Helen, reaped an are~S

parent advantage from the succes~s of this enterp~i~f&Ei

;D To

To the other Greeks it proved ·a sou~rce of the bitterest
misfortunes. The fields· of Troy were drenched with the
blood of their best ·commianders and soldiers, of· whomn
th~e far greater part were buried there; and the;'remains
o~f their army, after being further considerably diminish-
ed by the disasters of a tempeffuous voyage, f~ound, on
their arrival at home, nothing but mortifications andc
disappointments of the most cruel kinds. Their chief,
Agamemnon, had been but a thort while in his own
kringdom,r ~ when he was murdered by Egyptus the son of
Thyfites, who usurped his throne as the reward of his

vdllany. Hermione, the daughter of Menelaus and Helen, had
been first married to Orestes, the son of Agamemnon ;
but was afterwards taken from him, and given to Pyr-
rhus the fron of Ach~illes. Orefies having slain Pyrrhus,
s~ucceeded Menelaus in the kingdom of Sparta ; and seven
years after, having likewise killed the us~urper Egyptus,
together with Clytremneitra his own mother, who had
been accessory to the murder of her, husband Agamem-
2xon, he united the kingdom of Sparta with that of Ar-
gos and Mycene. Orcites, in the mean time, felt the
anoft bitter remors~e for his cruelty to his mother.
HPence the poets have taken occasion to fay, that he
was haunted by the furies. TIifamnenes s~ucceeded his
father Orefies ; but was dethroned, and expelled his
kiingdom by the H-leraclidae=, after .reig-ningf three years.

TIhe H-eradlida: iTere at this time headed by three bro-

thers, Temanes, Ctefiphontes, and Ariffodemus, sons.
of Ariftomachu~s, gfi-eat-grandfon .of Hercules. They
laid claim to the Peloponnefei, as belonging to them by
hereditary right, and recovered it accordmngly. Tema-
nes got the city of Ahrgos, Ariffodemnus that of Sparta,
a~nd c~tefiphontes M~ycene.. T'he return of the Heracli-
d6 ·produced a great -revolution among the Rtates of
Greece, and annihilated, the power of the Pelopidae.
The Achean~s, who had formerly inhabiited a part of
~Laconia, were by that event: obliged to remove to Asia
TVMinor, · wlhere. they occupied that part. of the continent

formerly

formerly known by the name of Eohta; and there found-
ed Smiyrna, and several other cities. TIhe lonians too,
who poffeffed another diffri~t of the Peloponinefe, ~were
expelled that country by the Heraclidaie, and obliged,
in like mnanner, to retire to Asia Miinor ; where they
took poffiiron of the country called after the m lonia,
and there built Ephesus, Clazomene, Samnos, &tc.

As the four principal tribes of Greekrs, diftingfulfhed

by the names of Eclians, BAceans, lon~ians, and Dorians,
were perfeatly indfependent of one another, and con-
fined thernfelv-es each to its particular territory, every
one of them preserved its peculiar manner of speaking.
Hence arose four principal dialceas of the G~reek lan-
guage; the Artic, used by the Athenian·; the Lonic,
by the peo~ple of lonia; the Doric, by the Lacedemo-
nians and Arg~ives; and the Eolic, by the Boeotians anid
the inhabiitants of Eaia.

The H-eradidaze and Pelopidae furnifhoed kings to Spar-

ta for the ·space of 900 years, reckoning down to the
time of the tyrant Machanidas.

Ariifodemus, at his death, left behind him two fans,

Euryfithenus and Procles ; who being twins, and so, ex-
achy like e~ach other, that it was hairdly pofirble to dif-
tinguiih them, were therefore made joint kings, From
their timeSparta was always governed by two kings.
Eury (1he nus wNas su~cceeded by his son Agi·s, andi Procles
by his s~on called Ous. It was -in their time that the
slaves called Helots wiere first known at Sparta. Tlhe
inhabitants of Helos, a city in the neighbourhood of
Sparta; having refused to pay a cer-tain tributi- imposed
by Agis upon all the territories of Lacedemon, that
kring=, desirous to confirm his authority by an example
of severity, laid siege to their city, took it, and made
all the inhabitants slaves. They were condemned to the
molt disgraceful anld painful employments, . and treated
with much rigour and cruelty. In pr ocefs of time, the
Spartans obliged therm to labour their grounds, and
kept them in a Rtate of perpetual servitude.

T~lhe Spartans took. advantage of the weakness and

D 3 extreme

iextreme good-nature of one of their kings, Eurytion,
to encroach. on the royal prerogative. This produced
confusion in the government. Eunomus, another of
their kings, left two sons of different marriages, Poly.
de~tus and Lycurgus. Polydeftus fucceededt to Eu-
nomus; but died without leaving any child, though his
wife was pregnant at the time o~fhis death. Lycurgus;,
therefore, who afterwards became to famous, ilext
no~unted the throne, as colleague to Archelaus; but
he declared to !the people, that he assumed this dignity
mrneley as guardian for the child whom his brotherfs
wife thould bring forth, to whom the crown of right
belonged. The queen, in the mean time,· signified to
Lycurg~us, that, on condition of his marrying her, the
would destroy the child in her wiomb. Lycurgus was
shocked at this horrid proposal1; but judged it prudent
to dissemble, and to avoid, under various pretences, to
come to a final explanation with the queen, giving in
the mean time private orders to bring him the child the
momlent it thould be born. The queen, at last, brought
forth a boy; who was immediately carried by Lycurgus
into the public assembly, and presented to the chief men
of Sparta as their king. The name of this king was
Charilaus. W7e shall resume the sequel of the Lacede-
monian ·hiffory in the beginning of n~xt chapter.

~ATH~EN S.

CECROPs, a native of Egypt, led a colony of

3556. his countrymen into Greece, fettled in Attica,

and founded the kingdom of Athens. 'Fl[e di-

vided the country into twvelve diffrifts, and afirumed the
name of king. Hle pitched on a hill in the mipht of a
large plain for the foundation of his city, and liuilt the
citadel on the rockr in which the hill terminated. He
eftablithed religion among his fubje~ts, and inflituted
a particular form of worship to Jaipiter and Minerva.
;As the foil of the country of Attica ivas barren, his s~ub·-
je t~s were laid under the neceility of making uAi of na-
vllgatxon to bring corn from Africa and Sicily. I'he

Ar~eo-

.Areopagus, a kind of senate, which assembled and held
its deliberations upon a hill near the citadel, consecrated
to Miars, was likewise instituted by Cecrops. This tri-
bunal was afterwards rendered by Solon the mofP fa-
scous in the world.

The names of the f~uccefforss of Cecrops were, Cra-

naus, ~Amphi~ryon, E~rifthonius, ·Pandion, Erea~heus,
Cecrops II. Pandion II. Egeus, Thereus, Maneftheus,
Demophoon, Oxintes, O3ephidas, Tf-imethes, ~Melantus,
and Codrus.

Cranaus was expelled Athens by Amphiatyon and

Hfellen, sons of Deucation king of Theiffaly. It is
thought that the Greeks derived their name from this
Hellen.

Amphidtyon inflituted the famous assembly

called after his name. It was composed of ;de- I497.
paties ·from twelve, or, according to some, from
one and thirty neighbouring Rtates, among whom this
king brought about a fort of confederacy. Two depu-
ties from each of there Rtates met twice a-year at Ther-
mnopylae, to deliberate on the affairs of Greece in gene-
ral. The Amphiftyons had a power of determining in
the laRt resort all c'ontroverfies that subsisted between
thos~e slates, and of imposing high fines on the party
found· in the wrong. The members of this court, be-
fore their admimlon, bound th-emselves by the most fe-
lemn oaths and imprecations, to the (t~riaR performance
of the duty of their offce. Tthey particularly engaged
th~ems~elves to execute vengeance against those who
t~hould presume to abitraa any gift from the temple of
,Apoll~o. The authority of this tribunal prevailed in all
its vigour till the time of Philip king of Macedon ; who
having procured himself to be elefted president of it, a-
bused the power repos~ed in him, and by that means
brought the court into contempt.

Bacchus, known likewise by the name of Dionyfluzs,

having in the- time of Amphiayon come into Greece,
accompganied by other natives of the east, infirudted the
~Greekrs in many useful arts, particularly in the culture

D 4 of

of the vine. In return, the Greekrs acco'umted him ·a
god, and raised altars to his memory. T~he birth and
conqueits of this god have furnish~ed an ample field for
the imaginations of the poets to emnbellith~.

Under the reign of Eri~honius, is placed th~e rape of

Proserpine, the daug~hrer of Ceres qupeen of Sicily*; the
journey of Ceres in~to Greece to seek her daughter; her
~stay at Etleufis with Triptolemus, whom the infitru~ted
in tillage; and the eftabliflurnent of her worship at E-
leutis. The ceremonies atteniding this worthip were
known by the namle of the Eleufni~ran mtyfieries, and b~e-
came extremnely famous on account of the impenetrable
secrecy with which they were concealed.

Erifthonius infituted, in honour of Minerva, the

festival called PanathCeneat, on account of the great con-
course of people from every part of Greece that flocked
to Athens on that oceafion. .Eriahonius too taught the
Athenians thesufe of mnoney.

Pandion II. had four sons: o ne of there was Egeus

his fixceffor ; Pallas, anothe-r of them, had fift-y sons,
called after him· Pallantidy Egeus had but one child;
and him by a concubine called ~E~thr, the daughter of
Pitheus. This child was Tfiheleus, one of the m~ft fa-
- mous heroes of antiquit~y.

Theseus, while yet very· young, and before

I264. his accefiron to the throne, having heard of the

Sexploits of Hercules, was seized with a violent

desire to imitate him. After hiis example, therefore, he
employed hims~elf in clearing the highways of robbers,
of whom he destroyed a great number. On returning
to Athens, his father received him with much joy, and,
named him his successor in the kingdomn.

On coming to the throne, he was involved in a war

against his confins, the sons ·of Pallas, who were pro-
voked that an illegitimate son thould be preferred to them
in the kingdom. But being unable to resist the valour
of Theseus, they were vanquished and dispersed. As
Theseus could not bear to be idle, he employed hims~elf
in destroying the monfiers that: infefi~ed the country. He

kcilledl

killedi the bull of Marathon; and freed the Athenians
from a tribute of seven boys and as many girls, imposed
upon them by Minos king of Crete ; who, to revenge
the death of his brother Androgeus, whom the Athe-
nians had slain, invaded their country, and forced them
to submit to that se~vere condition. But Thereus ha-
ving accompanied the children to Crete, attrac'fed the
affeAions· of Ariadne the daughter of IVinos, married
her, and got the tribute dikcharged. This s~eems to be
·the simple truth of the matter ; but the poets, in their
usual manner, have given the affair a more marvellous
turn. They tell us, that Theseus received from Ariadne
a clue to conduft him through the labyrinth, wherein
was krept the M/i~notaur, a moniter, half man half bull
to which, by the command of an oracle, the AthenianI
children were given to be devoured; and that TPhereus
having, accordingly, by the help of this clue, made his
way through the labyrinth, and reached the monster,
attacked and killed it, and so relieved his countrymen
·fromn the tribute.

T'hef~eus, after effe~king the objeat of his journey, set

out in triumph on his return for Athens. But having
on his way loft Ariadne, who was run away with by a
priest of Bacc'hus, he was so grieved, that he omitted to
hang out white colours, the signal of viaory agreed on
wnth his father. Egeus, fr~om this, believing his son to
be dead, jumped into the sea that now bears his name,
and drowned himfeltf.

Theseus having procured peace to his country, ap-

plied hims~elf to govern it with wisdom., He is said to
hav~e induced all the inhabitants of Attica, partly by his
authority, 'partly by perfuation, to remove from their
vuillages to Athens, there to live in one great comm~u-
nity; and to have invited, by a public proclamation,
people of all other nations to come and fettle at Athens,
wvhere they were to be in every refpeEU on an equal foot
with the natives of Attica. This produced a large in-
crease mn the number of inhabitants, and in the extent
olf the city.

Aft~er

After accomplith~in~g this undertaking, he cpnverted

the system of government into a fort of republic, refer-
v~ing only to himself the command of the army, and the
s~upport of the laws. ~He divided the people into three
class~es; the nobility, the farmers or husbandmen, and
the mechanics. All public offices were to be occupied
by the nobility alone, but the reft of the people had the
power of choosing the particular person on whom ea'ch
office was -to be conferred. He; eftabithed the tribunal
of the Prytaneum, composed of fifty members; who,
among other business, were to provide for the f~ubfft~-
rence of such poor citizens as had done eminent s~ervice
tos the R~ate.

After having properly fe~ttled .the adminiff-ration, he

spent the remainder of his life in travelling about in
qlueft of adventur-s, in which to signalize his valour.
H~e had a share in the vi~toryr over the Centaurs ; in the
conquest of the golden fleece; in the chace of the Ca-
lydonian boar; and in both the wars of T~hebes. Thie-
feus and Pirithous having met with an intention to
fight, wNere to struc-k with admiration at the fight of
each other, that they laid aside all hostile intentions,
and fr-om that time forward lived in the most perfeft
friendship. ·They of concert forcibly carried off the
famous Helen daughter of TZindarus; and afterwards
went to the court of Aido-neus, surnamed Pluto, king
of the M~oloffi, to carry off his daughter likewise. But
Pluto flew Pirithous, and threw Tihefeus into prison,
wrhence he was released by Hercules. The poets have
involved there events in abundance of faPbles. Ther~eus,
on returnmng to Athens, found great cause of dis~quiet
from his family-affairs, which ended in the tragical
de~aths of his wife Phedra, and of his son Hippolitus.
NIVeneitheus too had taken the opportunity of his ab~-
fence to prejudice the public against him. Thereus,
thinking it beneath him to punish the ungratef~ul Athe-
niatns, satisfied himself with aba~ndoning their country,
and retired to the island of Scyros. Some time after,

merit,· laid an ambnih for himn, and cauled him to be
thrown fr~om the top of a precipice.

Theseus was the greatest king the Agtheneanrs ever

had. His tomb, in after times, became famous by be-
ing made a refuge for slaves.

Meneftheus d~istinguished himnfelf by. his military fkrill

in the war against Troy.

In the reign of Codrus, the Heracidae being at war

with the Athenians, were told by the oracle, that they
t~hould be viatorious if they did not kill Codrus. That
prince, hearing of the response, disguised himself in a
peafa8nt's habit, and, entering the enemy's camp, pro-
vroked them to krill him. W~hen the Heraclidae were in-
formed of their having slain Codrus, they immediately
fled.

Codrus was the last king of Athens. For, on his

death, the government became republican, by the efta-
blifhment of Archons ; an office which was at first he-
reditary, and little inferior, in point of power, to
royalty itfelf.--We thall in the next chapter resume:
the hiffory of this republic.

*~ CHA P. I

Afairs of Greece, frome the abolition of the kingly govern-

ment in the principal f~ates, till the time thrat Hippias
took refug~e in Perjia.

FROMI what has been said in the preceding chapter,

it appears that the government in all the different

Rtates of Greece was originally monarchical. B~ut the
tyranny of their princes soon produced a total alteration
mn the s~ystem ; awakened in the minds of the Greeks
that ardent desire of liberty which ever after so firongly
marked the charaaer of this wonderful people, and
threw them into so many separate republics. For some
time, indeed, we thall fee private persons now and then
appear, who, prompted by their ambition, attempt to

be-

become sovereigns of their country, some by policy and
address, some by open violence and the force of arms.

SBut of all there Ra~tes, Sparta and Athens diftinguith.

ed themselves far above the reft ;.and by their extraor-
dinary merit, and the wisdom of thcir la ws, acquired to
great a superiority over the others, that they became~
the main springs of the political machine o ree
Between these two republics a spirit of rivalfhip very na-
tura~lly arose~, which at last broke out into long contests
and diffenflons ; in the course of which we shall fee the
other slates fometimnes siding with Sparta, so~metimes
with Athens, as their diffbrent interest~s incline them.
The principal events, therefore, of this hiffory, rnore
imnmediately refpeac~ those two republies, which con-
itantly occupy the foremost place, and appear, on all
odcedins, to sustain the fate of Greece. W~e proceed,
therefore, to refumie the history of Sparta and Athens,
fr·-mr the period at which we flopped in .the laia chap-
t~er.

L~PcURGUs, by his equitable and disinterested con-

dua~ in defeating the barbarous intentions of the queen,
and procuring Charilaus, yet a child in the cradle, to
be declared king, had highly offended that princess;*
who, in revenge, employed all her interest to form a
fa~iott againlt him, and got him accused of a conspiracy
against the slate. But L~ycurgus soon withdrew hims~elf
froml the danger of there machinations. Perceiving that
the laws wecre entirely disregarded, he mieditated an ex-
traordinary reformation in the government. For that
purpose he resolved to travel into foreign countries, that
-he might have an opportunity of oblerving with his own
eyes the various cuffom~s and inititutions tof different
nations the maftC renowned for the wifdoli of thieir le-

giflation.; T7Vith thbis view he first went: to the island of Crete,
where the celebrated 1Vrinos had efaablifhed a system of
lawfs; the rigid spirit of which was miuch to the liking
cos Lycurgus. This Mliinos was. a pow~erful prince, who

4 had

bad flourithed a co years before the Trojan warj and
whose 'virtues h~ad procured him the highest effeeen.
Having subdued the island of Crete, he res~olved to fe-
cure his conquest by the wifdomn of his laws. The go-
vernment there, at the time of his conquest, was mo--
narchical. But to bring that form of government to its
utmofit perfe~tion, Minos judged it necef~ary to make
the prince as fubje~t: to the power of the laws as the
nation was fubje~t to the power of the prince ; who by
that means might have an unlimlited power of doing
"ood, while at the fame time he thould be totally re-
firained from doing stiikhief ; the laws committing to
him the most precious of all trusts, the care of a whole
people, on condition of his ruling them as -a father and
prote~tor, not as an oppressor and tyrant. Fromn Creie
Lycurgus went into Asia; where he colle~ted into one
body the work~s of Homner, which before were disperse~d
about in detached fragments. From AEIa he travelled
into .Egypt, where he acquired a v~ast fund of k~now-

ledge. After having maturely considered the various forms
of government that had fallen under his observation
and deliberately w~eighed the advantagecs and difa8dvang
tages of each, he adopted into his owtn system what ap-
peared to him the most eligible. The refiult of~all ther~e
painful refea-rchesi was the famous Spartan legislation,
which has been the wonder of s~ucceeding ages; and
which to us, in these latter times, would appear'to be
entirely chimerical and imprat~ticable, were it not at,
tefied past all poss~ibility of doub; by every ancient author
who i'peaks of it; many of whour, such as Plato, Ari-
ftotle, Xenophon, and Plutarch, were eye-witueffes of
what: they mention.. It is, besides, an u'ndoubted fa~t,
that this fyfteni f~ub~ifted during a [pace of more than
700 years. W~e cannot, ho-wrver, fufficiently ·admire
how It was pofirble for one man to s~ucceed in establish-
ing a form of government, so violently repugnant in
several particulars to th~e most powerful pafians of the
h~uman foul.

During

DrinSEg the abf'ence of Lycurgus, the Lacedemonians

became extremely turbulent, and Sparta was on the
brink olf falling into downright a~narchy. Perceiving
bow much they flood in need of a man of superior parts
and und~erstanding, they dispatched mess~engers to in-
treat Lycurgus to return. He immediately obeyed the
invitation. But before proceeding to promulgate his
laws, he chose to fortify hlimelf with the authority of the
gods.; and for that purpose he went to consult the oracle
of Delphos, where he found means to obtain a favour-
able. response.

Upon his arrival at Sparta, he first communi-

8 84. cated his scheme in private to the leading men

of the city. Having procured their approbation,

he proceeded to the market-place, escorted by a num-
ber, of armed men; and there explained to the people
the alterations he intended to bring about in the go.
vernment, and the new inflitutions he proposed to eftal
blith. W~e forbear at present to enter on a detail of
those inflitutions, because the course of the narrative
fihould thereby be too much interrupted; but we haill
speak of them at length in the sequel.

Lycurgus was almost entirely employed, during the

remainder of his life, in bringing his laws to perfec-
tion, a~nd in enforcing the observance of them. In this
he met with much opp~oit~ion; and dis~played, perhaps,
no less fortitude and prudence in prevailing with his
fellow-citizens to submit to his regulations, than he had
ihown wisdom in devising them.

After having put the finishing hand to his work, and

tas~ted of the pleasure of feeing his inflitutions firmly
eftablithed, and his countryrmen accuffomed to the ex-
ercife3 of them, he declared his intention of consulting
the oracle, whether any further improvement were ne-
ceifary; and obtained their solemn promise to observe
them till his return. On arriving at Delphos, he was
assured by the prieffeirs, that while Sparta kept his laws
·in obfiervance, the thoulld be the most illuffri~ous and
h~appy city in the world. Lycurgus tranfmnitted this re-

fponfe

fp~onfe to Sparta ; and confide ring his plan to be nowR
entirely completed, he died a voluntary death, by ab-
Rtaining from all nourithment.

The reform~tation of the Spartan government by Ly-

curgus, is reckoned a s~econd revolution rthere. For the
future, therefore, we are to confider that Rtate as a re-
public, in which the kings were no more than the prin-
cipal magiffrates.

Hifforians place the birth of Homer not many years

prior to that of Lycurgus.

Soon after the death of Lycurgus, a war having bro.

ken out between the Lacedemonians and Argives about
a fmnall territory called Thyrea, both parties, to spare
the lives of their citiz;ens, agreed to terminate the dif~-
pute by 30o chosen men of each fide. T'here 600 co~m-
batants engaging accordingly, fought ;with fach fury
and obitinacy, that they were all killed on the spot exr-
cept three; two of whom were Argives, and the third
a Lacedemonian named Orthrades #. As both parties
claimed the vi~tory, a general battle enfited; in which
the L~acedemonians remained the conquerors. Orthra.
des, disdaining to survive the reft of his fellow-foldiers,
killed himself on the field of battle t.

This year Theopomnpus, one of the Lacedie-

mnonian kings, established the Ephori in Sparta ; 760.
or rather, the com~mon people, provoked by the
opprefflon under which they groaned, prevailed with
that king to give them those maiffiirates as a check on
the power of the kings on the one hand, and of the fe-
nate on th~e other.

The Lacedemnonians about the fa8me time declared

war against the M~effenians, for having violated
fomne Lacedemonian young women, wNho had 743*
gone, according to custom, to pay their devo-

tions

*C The reader wiHl be fkruck with the limilarity between this combat~

and that of the Horadii and Curiatii in the Roman history, a~nd a much

tions at- a temple on the confines of bot~h slates. To
revenge this ins~ult, the Lacedemonians, under the
comm and of Alcmenus, surprised the town of Arnphea
iby night, and put all the inhabitants to the [word. 'The:
M/effenians were not at that time in a situation to makre
repritals. But about four years after, they marched iirto
Laconia under the command of their king Euphaes, and
came to an engagement with the Lacedemonians, to
which ·the night alone put an end.

Next year the Lacedemonians took~ the field, after

binding themselves by oath, not to return to Spar~ta till
they thould reduce every place in the poifeflion of the
IVIeffenians. A battle ensued , in which both parties
fought with such obstinacy, that fatigue obliged them to
separate by mutual consent. The M~effenians, exhault.
ed by the double calamity of a war and of a plague, as-
~femzbled at Ithome, a firong place situated on the f~um-
mit of a hill, and sent to confiult the oracle at Dllelphos
about the means of relief in this desperate extremity.
The oracle returnred for answer, That they must s~acrifice
to the gods a virgin of royal blood : and Ariftodemus,
a Meifenian ~of royal extraftion, in obedience to the di-
vine command, offered'up his own daughter. About:
the fame time, a bloody battle happened in the neigh-
bourhood of Ithome, where the Meffenians performed
prodigies of valour to ref'cue the body of their king Eu.
phaes, who had fallen covered with wounds in the fight;
and they were at last furccef~sful. Here Ariftodemus ob-
tained the prize of valour, as the person that had fought
with the greatest bravery ; and he was likewise chos~en
king in place of Euphaes, who died of his wounds.

Ariffodemus having led his countrymen to another

engagement with the Lacedemonians, defeated them,
and took their king Theopompus, whom, together with
300 Spartans m~ore, he put to death in cold blood.
The Lacedemonians, apprehensive left their families
th~ou1d fail in the mean time, by their long ablence from
home, in consequence of the oath they had taken, sent
back to Sparta all th~e soldiers. who had joined the army after

after the taking of that oath, to cohabit with the Wb~rea
of those that remained. The issue of this extraordinaryi
conne~tion were dliftingulfhed by the name of Pa~the~-
niarts; wrho, as soon as they were able to carry arms,
banithed themselves of their ow~cn accord from Sparta,
and formed a settlement at Tarentum in Italy.

Four years after, a general a~tion ensued between

the Lacedemon~ians and Mlelffnians;6 in which a partyi
of the latter attac'ked the Lacedemonians frornr an amnbu-
f~cade, put them to flight, and procured their country-
men the vi~tory. B3ut though the Spartans had loft in
this engagement the flower of their troops, they new
verthelefs laid siege to Ithome. Ariff odemus, feeing his
countrymen reduced to the last extremity, killed him-
felfin despair on the tomib of his daughter. The reft
of the M~effenians, after enduring the utmost miseries
of famine, were obliged at last to capitulate. TIhe La-
cedemonians made the greatest part of them flaivesj and
forced them to cultivate their grounds; but many of'
them escaped, and took refuge among different nationsi
This firlt war was of twenty years continuance.

The Meffe~nians, after enduring the Lacede-·

monian yoke for thirty years, resolved at last to 685*
attempt the recovery of their liberty. For this
purpole they put themselves under the command of A-·
riff~omenes, a youngf man of extraordinary bravery, and
great skill in the art of war; and under his conduft~
vanquished their enemies in several engagements. The
Lacedemonians beings hard pressed, consulted the oracle.
The response bore, That they must request a general
from the Athenians ; who in derision sent them one
Tyrteus a poet. The Lacedemnonians found their as-
fairs not at all mended by this. expedient ; and after be-
ing beaten in three fauccffive battles, they resolved to
return to Sparta. But this resolution was opposed by
Tyrteus; who, to route their courage, recited to them
some verses that he had composed with great care.
These verses were to well calculated to inspire bravery,
and a contempt of danger, that they animated the La-·

E cedemoiliane

4edemonians to the highest pitch of martial rage.
They required, with one voice, to be inflantly led
against the enemny ; and after a most bloody battle, ob-
tained a co-mplete vi~tory. The remains of the Meffe.
nian army retreated to Mount Eira, where they defend-
ed thiemfelvefs a long time against all th~e efforts of the
Lacedemonians. But their general, Ariffomenes, ha-
vi-ng fallen amidst a croud of Spartans, upon wNhomn he
hlad mlade a mnof, desperate attack, his countrymen were
so dis~couraged by his death, and to wea'kened by their
·repeated engagements with the Lacedemonians, -thAt
they were at last overpowered. Such of them as fell
into the hands of the enemy, were reduced to the con.
dition of Helots. The reft, feeing their country ruined
past all hopes of r-ecovery, retired to Sicily, and there
founded, a city, called at first .MefeDrne, and afterwards
IV7ef~ina. Th~eir last brave general, Ariffomenes, was
the sworn enemy of the Spartans, and, while he lived,
their conflanit terror #.

~TE have already observed, that monarchy~was abo-

lithled at Athbens unider the children of Codrus, and go-
v·ernors called Archons set up in place of the King.
Tlhefe were the .principal magiffcrates of the republic,
and were bounid to govern the s~Late according to the
oftablifhed laws. In the beginning they enjoye-d their
of~fice f~or life, and M~edon was the firlt'who was invested
with that dignity. Aft-erwards, upon the death of
Alemeon, the people created nine Archons, and con-
fiTned their authority to the sp~ace of ten years. TLhe
chief of them was called Eponzymus Archon, and the
year was diftinguiithed by his name : the fiecond was
called Kiing ·; the third Polemarchus ; and the remaining
fiix bore the general name of The/motheta.

Such a limited authority as that vefied in the Archans,

was infufficient to curb men of so turbulent a dif~poth-
tion. The Athenians, accordingly, were for several
years <liffraaed by controversies and fa~tions. For

having

" The combat between the Horatii and Curiatii is placed in the year

having as yet; no written laws, they disagreed about al-
·most` every point both of r-eligion and government-
Cylon took advantage of there troubles, and seized
the citadel ; but the Athenians found means to quell his
inferreaidon.

Hlaving learned, by experience, that real liberty con-

sifts in a due dependence on laws and government, the
Athenians resolved~ to take the mofit effeatual measu~res
for putting an end to their diff~entions. With this view
they cast their eyes on one of their Archons
named Druaco, a citizen of examplary virtue, and 623*
the most rigid severity of manners; but whose
extreme rigour, in point of government, bordered on
inhumnanity. Ch-osen by the Ath~enians to be their lawu-
giver, D~raco, from a zeal to flop the licentioufnels of
their manners, fell into the opposite extreme, and made:
death~ the puniihment of the molt trivial oiffences, even
of idleness and indolence. On this acc~ount the laws of
D~raco wIpere sTaid to have been written., not with inkr,
but with 'olood : and their excef~ive severity procured
thern the fate of all violent inflitutions; they quickly
fell into difnuFe.

At .length arose a man worthy to perferibe

laws to the Athenians. This was the famous 64 g.
Solon2, a native of Salamis. H-aving lately reffo-
red the Anthenians to the government of that island by
a firatagem, he had,,by that exploit, acquired great rel
potation : and his integrity, hisi wifidom, his knowledge
in the sc~ience of government, but, above all, the mild-
ness of his disposition, soon procured him the esteem of'
his fellow-citizens. The Athenians, therefore, pitched
on him to reffore tranquillity in their city ; created hiux
Archo~n-ex.traordinary ; and invelted him with full au-
thority to make such reformation in the government as
he thould judge necessary. The unlimited power with
which he was intruffed might have condu~ed him to
the throne ; but his virtue and. moderation would not
permit him to give way to the temptation.

Solon applied himself with great care an~d diigence

Ez to

to dik~hdrgis the trust reposed in him by his countrymen.
He fettled the public government on a more Rleady
foundation, and .devised for the Athenians a body of
excellent laws. Of his init~itutions, so far as they re-·
garded the p~ublic adminiffration, we ihall afterwards
fpeakr at fomre length. Hi~s private laws fall not within
our design.

After havin gpublifhed his l~aws, and bound the citi-

zens by oath to obey them, -Solon left Athens for the
Space of ten years, both with a view that his institutions
might, i~n the mean time, take deep root, and that he
might avoid the daily complaints and difficulties started
to him about their. executionr and interpretation. In
this interval he travelled into Egypt, and vilited Crcef~us
king of Lydia. That prince having made an oftenta-
tious display of his vast wealth and magnificence, to ex-
cite the admiration of Solon, had the mortification to
fee them regarded by the philosopher with the most~
Stoical indiff~erene, and coul~d not draw from him the
fmnalleft compliment on that account. Solon only took
that opportunity to remark, that no man could with
certainty boaff~ of his happiness till the instant of his
death.,

Duringf the absence of Siolon, great disorders were

occasioned at Athiens by three faftions formed under
three different heads; Mlegacles, PiTfifratus, and Ly-
curgus. Mtegacles was extremely powerful by his
wealth, being the ·son of Alcmenus, whom K~ing Croe-
sus had loaded with riches, and having married the
daugihter of Cliffenus, one of the most opulent princes
of Greece. PlififfCratus, by the mnildnefs of his beha-
viour, his affability, and his liberality to the poorer
citizens, had acquired the hrigheft popularity. But his
jininuating addres~s was no more than an artful cover to
his ambitious designs. Solon found things in this fitua-
tion on his return to Athens.

Piliffratus, the better to effeEU his purpos~e, employed

one of the most: singular and bas~est firatagems. Having
wounded himself in s~everal parts of his body, he ordered

bis friends to carry him all covered with blood· to the
snarket-place, where he told the people, that h~e had
fuffered this cruel treatment from the enemies he had
created to himself by his zeal -for the good of the re-
public. The populace, moved by his flory an~d ap-
pearance, rose in his favour, overpowered the opposite
faakions, and appointed a guard of fifty men for his
person. With the assistance of there, -and of a greater
number of his own creature's whom he armed, Pifiltra-
tus first seized the citadel, and soon after made himnfelf
matter of the whole city.

Solon, after upbraiding Pifiltratus in vain with

the injustice of his oforpation, and the people 560G.
with their cowardice and foll~y, retired from A-
thens, overwhelmed with grief, and went to pass the
·remaining part of his life in the island of Cyprus. But
sorro~w at feein g the opprefiron of his country soon p~u~t
a period to his days; and he died the first year after his
retirement, at the age of 80. Solon certainly poffeffed
a philosophical spirit, and was animated with an extra-
ordinary zeal for the republican form of governmerr.
But his fyfitem was fundamentally faulty, in1 so far as it
threw all the power into the hands of the multitude,
who, as the event of Pifiltratus's intrigues evinced, are
extremely apt to be led affray by an artful designing
man. It mnuft, however, be allowed, that he gavie the
Athenians, who had been -bred up in the greatest licen-
tioufners, the best nations of order, law, and juffice,
of which at that time they. were perhaps capable.

Solon was cotemporary with the seven wife men of

Greece, and was himself accounted one of their num-
ber. The names of the other fix were, Thales, Bias,
Pittacus, Cleobulus, Periander, and Chilo. They were
honoured with the title of werfe men on account of their
having been all legislators, in fomne degree or other, and
ofgtheir having delivered many general maxims of miorali-
ty in thort Laconic sentences.

P-ififfratus enjoyed his ill-gotten tyranny for no

Bon~ger a space than three years, Mcegacles and Ly-

E 3 cargus

curg~us having united their faEtions, and procured his
expulsion. But Megcacles soon becomning jealous of his
rival's power-, of~fered his daughter in marriage to
Pififfiratus, and the foveretign aucthority along with her.
Pififfratus accepted the offer, and Lycurgus was ex-pelled.
But Pififfratus, the more eiffeftually to secure the popular
approbation, resolved to mak~e hlis refforation appear as
the immediate effeEt of divine interpolition ; and for
that purpose prevailed on a woman of a fine mnajeftic
figure to play the part of MTinerva on the occaflon, and
in that charafter to anno'unce his arrival. T~he w
man, accordingly, affiuming the dress in, which that
g~oddes~s wdas usually represe~nted, and appearing flad-
denly. in the city, mounted on a m~agnificent chariot,
afted her part to perfeaion, and proclaimed aloud,
that she, M~inerva, was just about to bring back Pjfiffra.
tus. The people regarding this piece of ro~guery as a
divine mandate, received the tyrant wFith thLe utmolt

30y. Hipparchus and Hippias, the sons of Pirfilratus by a
former marriage, apprehensive left- their brothers by
h~is prese~nt w~ife: might su~pplant them in the fuccefiaon to
the tyranny, artfully infiilled into the mind of their fa-
ther injurious ~u~fpicions of their Repm~rother. Mecga-
cles, to fispport his daughter, bribed the greater part of
the Ath-enians, induced them to revolt, and forced PHifi-

·itratus to fly a fcon~d time, and to takfe refugfe

556. In the iflandi of E~uboe~a, where he lived with his

family eleven years. In thle mean time his son

Hippias, a mnan of an ad~ivse intrig3uing difpoitrion, ha-
ving prevailed on several miaritime towns to declare in
his father's favour, Pififfratus soon fawv hims~elf at the
head. of a considerable body of troops, by whole assist-
adce he f~urprifled the city of Athens, at a time whs~en he
was not expeaecd, and entered it as its conqueror.

To establish his author-ity-, he thought it necessary to

accomplish the deftwa~ion of those- whLo supported the
party of M~egacles. Buat after -having- removed out of
the way aH who had pow~er and inclination to oppole
him~, he applied himeldf to cilice the remembranfce of

his

his cruelties : and it rnuit be acknowledged, that the
·mildness and juffice of his s~ubs~equent adminiffration
made amends, in a great measure, for his former
crimes; for from that time he applied his power to.
the best· of purpol~es. H-lis eloquence was of great ser-
vice to him in regaining the public affe~tion, and lulling
the Athenians into a forgetfulnefs of their former liber-
ty. He fludied by every mlethod to acquire popularity,
particularly by throwing his gardens open to all the ci-.
tizer~g ; and, upon the whole, he juffified the thaying of~
Solon, that he would have been the best citizen of A-
thens, if he had not been the mofti ambitious. He end-
ed his days in peace, and transmitted to his children his.
usurped sovereignty, which he had enjoyed altog~etherr
for the space of thirty-three years; during the last seven-
teen years of which he had reigned in the utmost peace
and tranquxllhty.

Hipparchas and Hippias his sons shared the kingdom
between them, and lived in perseEU harmony with each
other; Hipparchus, as eldest brother, en~joying the
chief honours. This man inherited his f~athe~r's extraor-
dinary love for the sciences. TSo inspire the Athenians
by the charms of poetry, with a tasse for letters, and
the polished manners which are a natural consequence
of knowleige, he invited to his court Anacreon and
Simonides, and patronizedd all men of diitinguifhed
genius., According to Plato, the tranquillity and hap-
Spinefs that prevailed during his reign revived the idea
of the golden age.

About the fame time Polycrates azforped the fove-

reign power at Samoes, and therificed his own brother
to his desire of occupying the regal dignity alone.
Having procured a fleet of r 00 vess~els, he rendered him-
~self formidable both in Europe and Af~iia, and wantonly
oppr~eifed both his fubjee~s anid his neighbours. Sparta,
by its warlike exploits, was now regfarded as the prin.
cipal republic of Greece. Its protec~ion therefore was
implored against the tyranny of Polycrates; and as the
Spartanls profeffed themnfelves the enemies of every fpe-

4A 4 cies

cies of derpotifm and oppreilion, they th'bught: themselves
bound in honour to check the progress of the tyrant.
With this view they fitted out a fleet, made a defeent
upon the island of Samnos, ahd laid siege to the town.
But their enterprise milcarried ; and, after being re-
pulsed in repeated assaults, they were at last obliged to
relinquith the undertaking, and to return home. Poly-
-crates, soon after, fell into the hands of the P-ertians,
and was by them crucified. Eaces su~cceeded h-im in the
tyranny ; but the people f~ound mieans to throw off his
yoke, and to recover their liberty.

H~ippias, after reigning eighiteen years at Athens, be-

camie at las-t cruel and despotic. Tfhe Athenians therel
fore grew weary of his tyranny, and. formed a confpi-
racy against him and his brother. The fa~tion of the
Alcmeonides, so called from their leader Megacles the
son of Alcme~nus, were the fom~entors and principal ac--
tors in this conspiracy. Harmodius and Ariffogiton,
both citizens of Athens, and mutually conne~ted by
friendship, resolved to revenge anm affr-ont offered to the
daughter of the former by H-ipparchus, who had obliged
hier to retire from a public proceflion at which th-e was
intitled to have afiftled carrying a bafkret of flowers.
NE·othing less~ would s~atisfy the resentment of there two
men than the deposition of the tyrants. H-laving con.
certed thme proper measu~res for their enterprise, they fe-
cretly imnparted their plan to a [mnall number of the
citizens, and fixed the day of · execution to be the feast:
of Panathenea, when all .the citizens wore arms. They
accordingly attacked and flew Hipparchus ; but were
theirnfelves instantly apprehended anid put to death.

Hippias having escaped the fate of his brother, fludied

the best means of fcuring h~is life for the future. H-e
put to the torture the accompices of the murderers of
his brother, to force themn to discover the othter circumn-
stances of the iplot. On this occallon a woman called
-Lionna,, who had been very intimnately conneated with
%-larmodius, behaved with the utmost heroif~rn. She
Ifcpported, with a courag~e infinitely f~uperio rd tch wat

Inight have been expeAed from her sex, the most cruel
torments ; and left the violence of the torture thould at
last make her utter what the chose~ to conceal, the cut
out her own tongue. The Athenians afterwards ereaed
to her memory a statue without a tongue. Several
citizens were sacrificed to the suspicions of Hippias, who
obliged all the partisans of the fadtion of the Alcmeoni·-
des to fly from Athens.

The~ Alcmeonides, in the mean time, were very ac-
tive in contriving means for bringing themselves back.
With this view they were so lucky as to engage in their
interests, by very liberal presents, the prieffers of Del.
phos ; who, as often as the Lazcedemonians came to
consult her, or to implore her intercefi~on with the
gods in their behalf, constantly anfwvered them, " That
** they must free Athens from the tyranny of the Pifi-
rc· firatidae." This firatagem had the desired effeat.
The Lacedemonians fitted out a fleet, and made a de-
scent upon Attica; but Hippias getting notice of their
purpose, made the necessary preparations to receive
them. On hearing that they were landed, he miarched
to oppose them, killed their commander, and put theux
to flight. But this check only served to exasperate the
Lacedemonians; who again returned into Attica with
a fresh arniy, defeated the Theffalian cavalry, which
were the chieffitrength of the tyrant's army, and laid
siege to Athens. Hlippias, unwilling to expos~e his chil-
d~ren to the consequences of a siege, sent them secretly
out of the city, to be carried to some place of sa~fety.
But the children having fallen into the hands of the e-
nemy, Hippias, to save their lives, readily agreed to re-
figr his sovereignty; and, in consequence of his agree-
ment, bade a last farewell to Athens, and retired to Si-
geum in Phrygia.

Thus the Athenians recovered their liberty,

after a tyranny of fifty years duration. They 5 10.
erefted statues to the memory of H-armodius and
Airiffogiton, who had begun this revolution, and set
thra up to public view, that the fight of them might

& . inlfpire

Inspire the citizens with a more violent hatred of ty.
ranny *.

Athens, however, enjoyed this calm but: a ·Sery

s~hort while. Clisthenes and Ifagoras, both .powerful
citizens, mutually aspired to the chief authority, and,
created two new fai~tions. But Clisthenes being richer
than his rival, easily brought over the populace to his
fide, and soon got the better of his antagonist. Clif.
thenes made fleveral alterations in the form of govern-
Inent; and in particular, created fix new tribes. It
was he who invented the punishment of offracifin,
whereby the people might satisfy their jealoufyT against
any citizen whom power, wealth, or abilities, set too
far above his fellow-citizens, by banishing him the city
for the space of ten years. The narne of this punish-
Inent was derived from a Greek word, signifying a par-
ticular kind of thell, on which each citizen inferibed his
vote on s~uch occasions.

T~Phe Lacedemonians dis~covering, in the mean time,

the trick of the Delphic prieffefs, and being already jea-
lous of the Athenians, desired to avail themselves of ha-
ving delivered them from tyranny, by assuming over
them a fort of superiority. -With this view, Cleomenes
king of Sparta espous~ed the cause of Ifagoras, who had
taken refuge in -that city ; and procured the banithment
of Clisthenes from Athens. But, not satisfied with
that, he marched against Athens at the head of an ar-
my,, expellerd from thence 7oo families, together with
all the partisans of Clisthenes, and took poffefiron of the
citadel. Here, however, he was invefied by the Athe-
nians, and, after enduring a three months siege, was
at last obliged to capitulate, on condition of being al-
lowed to depart in freedom with his Spartans. But all
the Athenians who had aif~ted him in, this exploit were
put to death. Upon this Clisthenes, and the reft who
had been banifbed, were-recalled. Cleomenes, howe
ever, of new efferted himself in favour of lIfagoras, and

for

·r In the preceding year, viz* 51 r, Tarquin was expelled from

Rome, and Consular government established there.

for that .purpose made another incurflon into Attica,
fopported by the Bee~otians. But the Athenians had the
advantage in several ati~ons rthat ensu~ed on that occa-
sion.

The Lacedemonians perceiving the thriving condition

of the Athenians since they had recovered their liberty,~
began to deliberate about reltoring tyranny among
them, and s~etting Hippias agnain on the throne, For
this purpose Hippias was invited to Sparta, to affill at an
assembly wherein the question w~as to be debated. In
this assembly Cleomnenes madle a speech in favour of
flippias~; but without any effea~. F'or Soficles, the de-
puty from Corint~h, spoke after him, and showed the
affemnbly, with f~uchl eloquence and good sense, how un-
worthy it was in slates who profe~tfd themselves the
enenues of tyranny to undertakre the defence and sup-
port of a tyrant, that every one prelent assented to his
opmxion.

Hippias thus dilappointed, retired to Attaphernes,

the Persian governor of Sardis, and implored his assist-
ance. That £iatrap, delightedt wCith so fair an o~pportu-
nity of reducing under the power of his malter Darius
fob important a cityr as Athens, which might open an
easy way to the conquest of the reft of Greece, gave a
ver-y favourable reception to H-ippias, and perfoaded Da-
rius to f~ummnon the Athenians to replace him on the
throne. But the threats of the king of Per £a were in-
effe~tual. The Aithenians returned an absolute refusa~l
to comply with his demand, resolving to endure every
extrenuty, rather than to open their gates to the tyrant.
Hippias, therefore, may be considered as the first cause
of the qjuarrel between the Greeks and Persians, though
it is true, that the latter received other f~ubje~ts of pro-.
vocation, of which we thall take notice in the sequel.

Eminenzt Wri.ters, Philosophers, drc.

As~ the first age of Greece had its heroes, so it had

likewise its poets, who devoted their talents to celebrate

the

the prafeks of their country, and of the great men it
produced; whom, by the excess of their praire, they
transformed from her oes into demigods. To the times
of peace and tranquillity, therefore, in this pericid, it:
thould seem, that the commencement of poetry ought
to be fix-ed. Though Homer is the most ancient poet
whose works have been tranfmxtted to us, it: is certain
that the art of poetry had before his time arrived among
the Greeks to a considerable slate of perfei~ion. This
is indis~putably eftablifhecd by tradition. For the names
of Linus, Orpheus, and Mufeus, which occur so fre-
quently both in the Greek and Latin poets and hiffo.
rians, are fufficient evidence of the existence of thoer
poets. B~ut as we have no opportunity of judging of
their works, of which it is very doubtful whether any
remains have come to our hands, ive must place Homer
a$t the head ofthe poets whose works yet exist~.

Homer is generally believed, and on very probable

grounds, to have lived before the institution of the O-
lympic games; for otherwise it is hardly to be imagi-
ned that he would have omitted to take notice of thoer
games in his works, as they would have afforded him
s~o excellent a field for defeription, an ornament of which
he appears to have been extremely fond. His birth,
~however, seems to be p laced, widr' a good deal of cer-
tainty, both by Vifher's chronology and the Arundel
tables, in the year of the world 3 x 20, that is, about
340 years after the siege of Troy : and he is commonly
accounted a native either of Colophon or of Smyrna.

Homer is ufoally represented as blind ; and we are

told that he employed himself in wanderings through the
country in the chara~ter of an itinerant bard. This,
however, mult not depreciate in our eyes' his wonder-
ful merit, of which his works donvey so h-igh an idea;
where we fee him carrying at once to thle summit of
perfeAion the art of Epic Poetry, of which he is ac-
counted the inventor.

The two principal poems of Homer are the IiaQd and

the Odyfy. The fubjeR of the 11iad is the wrath of

A~chilles,

Achilles, which proved so fatal to the Greeks wh~en be-
sieging Troy : The voyages and adventures of Ulysses,
after the sacking of that city, form the fabjeat of the
Odyssey.

The wNar a-gainst Troy, which furnilhes the fubjeat of

these immortal poems, has been called in qlueftion by
s~ome authors, who fancy it to be altogether the produc-
tion of Homer's invention. But their labours to con-
vince the world of the truth of this opinion have been
extremely vain. For, without mentioning the other
ancient authors who record that event, it is incredible
that Homer would have employed his heaven-born mule
on a f~ubjeat not heard of befbre. So accurate a judge
of human nature must have felt, that a fubjeat purely
diititious, however harmoniously fCung, could have
drawn from his hearers but a momnentary attention.
Had not the fasbjeat of his poem been deeply interesting,
muceh of its merit must: have been overlooked, and
much of that great fame at which he aspired must of
course have been loft.

We may therefore very reasonably conclude, that

the event of the war against T'roy was not only noto-
rious, but: was in Holmer's time regarded as the most fig-
nal and important: tranfadtion in which his countrymen
had been till then engaged. T;Te must, however, re-
member, that the poet lived about three centuries later
than the hifforical event which he celebrates. H·ence
it is more than probable, that he would avail himself of
this latitude to render the circumffances more faubler-
vient to his fancy; and that he would even take liberties
with some of the· principal faa~s, as well to flatter those
fbr whose immediate pleasure he composed his poem,
as to give fuller s~cope to his poetical enthusiasm.

Cicero says, that the works of Homner are rather

painting than poetry ; so skilful is he to delineate, as it
were, before the eyes of the reader, the circumitances
he desires to deferibe; which are generally the most
furblime and firiking to be found in nature. Horace
prefers him, ,on account of the knowledge and initruc- tion

tion with which he abounds, to the rnoft skilful philo.
fophers. Quintilian has given a very high elog~ium of
him, and has conveyed, in few words, a just idea of
the furpriling vrariety of style which he employs.~---..

Cc are at a lofTs wh~ich to adm~ire molt, his judgment or
cc his eloquence." Homer is peculiarly happy in the
harmony of his numbers, and the judicious arrange.
mentt of his words and periods. In the article of de]-
scription he is, as has been just observed, rather a pain-
ter than a poet, and in- that particular excels all the poets
that ever wrote. In deferibinf Ithe march of an army,
-the majelly of Jove,-the gods fighting-thle partings
of Heaor and Andromache, hie lays before our eyes so
many beautiful and lively pieces of painting.--Nothing
canl be more ingenious than hiis mnachinery, nor more
properly introduced. In vain have some mlodern wri-
rers attemnpted to criticise, and to find fault with his
works ; like the thades in a pi~Iture, their remarks have
only served to make his beauties more conspicuous. But
it mYIUft be acknowledged, that the many superficial and
petulant criticifmns advanced by the cerifurers of this di-
vPine bard, are perheps rnore than counterbalanced by
the extravagant and abford commendations laviihed up-
on him by faome of his injudicious admirers. *

#P Here I mull be forgiven for quoting four lines of a Noble

English poet, whlich, though frequently repeated by many of the
admirers of our ;mmorltal..bard, and though inserted by Mr Pope in
his preface to his translation of the Iliad, appear to mne to be ex-
travagant even to abfurdity.--The lines are th~ese :

Reegd the -charafters and the manners he deferibed, and
the language in which he wrote, and who excelled all
mankind in the acuteness of their undeditanding, an~d
the exquisite delicacy of their taste, regiarded his Iliad
and his Odyssey as the mofit perseEU work of human ge-
nius. Great cities contended for the honour of the
poet's birth : The venerable Lycurgus colleaed and
trankcribed the Iliad and Odylfey with his own hand,
~and introduced them from lonia into Greece: Solon
ordained them' to be solemnly recited in the Athenian.
republic : Alexander the Great was to pafioinately fond
of their perusal, that he placed them every night under
his pillow : and the most ingenious of the ancient critics
deduced from these poems the juffeft rules of criticifrn.
---To crown his praise, the best Epic Poets in sue-
ceeding times have looked up to Homer as the most:
pe'rfeft model for their imitation. They have not only
copied him exadly in the arrangement and conduat of
their fubjeca; but many passages in their poems are little
else than paraphirafes from his admirable works. But
the (tyle of Homer can be truly a~dmired in the original
alone, where he will be found to have employed to the
utmnoft advantage the inimitable perfec~ions of the finest
language ever spoken by men.

Homer is, besides, highly valuable on account of the

knowledge he affords us of the manners, sacrifices,
feasts, sieges, and -battles of the men of thiofe ancient
times. The purest maxims of morality are every where
incukcated by him. Under the emblem of Jupiter, he
defecribes an only and Almighty Deity, whose decrees
are fate; who is the source of all goodnes~s and happi-
ness; and whole3 providence dire a~s the most minute eJ
vents that occur throughout the universe.

Hejioqd was nearly cotemporary with Homer. He

was born at Cumes, a city of Etolia, and educated at
Alcra in Boeotia. Three of his performances have come
down to us: a fs, His Workrs and D~ays, in which he
treats of Agriculture. This piece was the model of Vir-
gil's Georgics I and abounds with excellent maxims,

both

both with refpeRl to the fabjeat of which it treats, and
to human life in general. 2dly, His Theogony, or Ge-
nealogy of the Gods. This is the meft certain account
of the ancient hieathen .mythology- 3dly, The Shield
of Hercules, so called from its being a defeription of the
thield of that hero. His taste in writing was extremely
different from that of Homer, whole constant aim was
the farblim-e, while that of Hesiod was the beautiful.
Rural objeas were the favourite theme, of Hefiod's
xnufe. Archilochucs was a native of Paros. Iambic verses, a
species of poetry adapted to violent and pafironate s~ub.
jeas, were invented by this poet. Quintihian says,
that his flyle was nervous and expressive; but that his
manner was very satirical and licentious.

Aleus was a inative of Mytilene. From him the Al.

cean verses d~erive their name. His pieces were s~evere
satires against the tyrants of Lesbos, and against Pittacus
In oarticular. His flyle, according to Quintdlian, was
Jofty, and bore a great resemblance to that of Homer.
Besides his merit as a poet, he was likewi~Se a brave fol-
dier.

Sappho was cotemporary with A~ceus, and a native of

the fame place. She invented the Sapphic verses, and
was honoured with the name of the Tenth Muse. Alceus
was a lover of hers; but his addresses seem to have
been ineffet·ual. She herself was greatly enamoured of
Phasn; who, on the other hand, paid very little regard
to her passionate and beautiful complamets. The purityr
of her manners was by no means anfwverable to the beau-
ty of her poetry. Her poems are chiefly admired on
account of her skilful defeription of the pafflons.

Ste/i~chorus, a native of HIimera in Sicily,

6 a . brought Ly ric poetry to perfeaion. None of

his works have reached us; but they were much

valued by the ancients for their gravity and dignity.

T~he/pis was cotemporary with Solon, and a

566. native of Icaria, a town in Attica. He is re-

garded as the inventor of Tragedy, which be-

fore

store his time was a fort of farce, intermixed with Fangs
in honour of Bacchus, and performed in the highways
and fireets, -or wherever the performers happened to
fall in with the throngeft audience. Thelpi sgave it a
different turn, He carried about his perform- rs in a
cart, which frved them likewise for a Rtage; he caused
them to befmnear their faces withi ·the lees of wine; and
introduced a person in the intervals of the chorus who
[poke a magnificent defeription of fame extraordInary
aftion.-T-Ihis was, in a manner, the cradle of tragedy.

Simtonrides, a native o~C~eos, one of the ifiands called

Cyclades, diftinguiihed himself by his elegiac verses.
His ans`wer to Hiero's question, C ~WH AT Is GOD) ?"
is well known. Sim~onides at first desired one day to
confider of the quc-ffion ; when that was clapfed, he de-
manded two days more; then four; and to on for a
considerable time, always doubling th~e space he had last
requefied. Hiero, fu~rpriferd at this behaviour, asked
him the reason of it ; " Becaufe,"' answ~ered Simnonides,
"C the more I meditate. on the fabjeft of your queltion,
"C the more incomnprehenfible I find it." His verses are
m~uch commended by the ancients, and have acquired
him great reputation.

THE origin of phjaoophy, as well as that of poetry,

is likewise tixrd to this period; when several Gre~eks,
whole difpolitions did not incline them to business, ap-
plied themfelvies to the fludy of nature. Th~ales,
a native of Miletus, and the founder of the lonic 60o
f~est, is thought to have led the way. He learned
astronomy of the priests of M/emphis, and was the firlt
Greek thiat treated of natural philosophy. He gave ge-
neral notions of the universe; and maintained, that an
only fupreaxe intelligence regulated all its motions. He
distinguished the sphere into eight circles. and d~icover-
ed the cause of ecliples, which in thoft· days were ac-
counted prodigies. Valerius Maxiuusteells of him-,
that on being afkred, T~hether a man could conceal his
aations from the D~eity ? he anfwrered, CL How is tL .at

F "L POf.

** pof~ible, since he cannot conceal from him even his
CC thoughts ?" From his firong att~achment to fludy be
declined marriage. His great knowledge procured him
a place among the Seven wife men of Greece.

Anaximzander, his scholar, distinguished the four ele-

ments, and found out the obliquity of the ecliptic.

Although there fi~rst philosophers did not arrive at an

accurate knowledge of natural philosophy, they have
nevertheless the honour of having pointed out the way
to their followers in the fame track, to attain more ex-~
nar dificoveries.

Heracli-tus was a native of Ephesus, where he became

the founder of a. fe&~ of philoso~phers. W ~e know little
more of him, except ·that he was a profeffed mifan-
thrope ; that he beheld with pity all the aftions of men;
that he constantly wept for their mis~ery, and thence ob-
tained the name of the crying philosopher.

~Demcrituls was a native of Abdera in Thrace, and

lived in the time of Xetrxes king of Persia. As a philo-
fopher, he was in high effeem. His deiire of know-
ledge induced him to travel through the greatest part of
the then known world ; and in those journies he spent a
very considerable fortune. He lived in perfe&t indiffe-·
rence about all the events of life, and used to laugh at
the follies of mankind. His refidinlg for the most part
among tombs, inclined many to believe him to be dif-
ordered in his judgment; and the inhabitants of Ab-
dera intreated H~ippocrates, the famous physician, to go
and fee him. Hippocrates, accordingly, paid him a
visit; but on discoursing with him, immediately dis~co-
vered him to be a man of extraordinary knowledge and
understanding. Diogenes Laertius assures us, that De-
mocritus pjoffeffed a fine genius, and had acquired a
great fu~nd of the most valuable learning.

BEFORE proceeding to the more intereffing part of
B Our hiffory, wve have judged it proper to subjoin
to this firlt Book a separate and diftin~t account of the
most curious particulars of Grecian polity and manners,
This it was impofiliblee to interweave with propriety into
the body of the work; and yet it is necessary that the
reader ihould be acquainted with the. f~ubjett, becanfe
otherwise~ he could not have an accurate comprehension
of many of the hifforical passages that follow. As the
particulars of which we mean at this time to -treat have
afitrong conneftion with, and serve to illuffrate one
another, we thought .it best to throw them altogether
in an Appendix. W~e have divided this Appendix into
two parts. In the first we shall speak more particularly
of the Spartan and Athenian governments; and, in the
second, we shall treat in general of the education of the
youth; of the games arid thows; of the principal cir-
cumitances relating to the art of war ; and -of the nxoft
remarkable particulars of the religion of the Greeks.

8 E C T. I.,

THE Sparta inflitutions may be considered under

two diflinc2 heads : a fl, So far as they regarded

the public government of the (tate ; 2dly, So far as
they regarded the private lives of the citizens.

Fa . The

The public government of Sparta was managed by

two kings, a s~enate, the people, and the ephori.-
Hence it pairtook of the nature of each of the three prin.
cipal formns of government, monarchy, aristocracy, and
democracy .

The civil power of the two kings of Sparta was very

limited. In time of peace they enjoyed little else than
the name of kingfs, arid were truly no more than the
two chief men of the senate. They were not at liberty
by themselves alone to undertake any public butinefs
whatever; all matters of that kind being determined by
a plurality of voices in the senate. In timte of war, in-
deed, they were invefied with an absolute authority, in
quplaity of generals. But they were accountable for
their management. Their conduA was liable to inve-
fligation, and their persons f~ubjeat to punishment. We
may~ therefore eafly conceive, that the two kings of
Sparta made but a poor figure in time of peace.

The senate n as the grauid inititution of Lycurgus. It

was intended to counterbalance the power of the kings
on the one hand, andi that of the people on the other.
It was composed of thirty members, including the two
kings. The whole legislative authority was lodged in
their hands, and every point was determined by a pulu
rality of voices.

The power of thie'people was by Lfycurgus very much

confined. 7 heir principal privilege was that of choo.
sing the members of the senate. Their assent indeed
was necessary to give Jagnaion to the laws. But they
were not perm~itted to reason or to deliberate upon such
matters as were laid before them; being obliged simply
to approve or to rejtEa the opinion proposed to them by
the ktcnate. T'heir assemblies too were in a great mea-
su~re dependent on the senate, which might call them
together or difif~ls them at its pleas~ure.

This was the footing upon which Lycurgus eftablith-

ed the public government at Sparta; and in this ficua-
tion it remained for about r30 years after his death.
About that period it was thought necessary to devise

some

some curb to the power of the senate, whicts appeared
to be too absolute and great. For this purpose, there-
fore, the Ephori were created in the time of K~ing
Theopompus. Thes~e magiltrates were five mn number;
were chosen by the people, and out of their own num-
ber; and continued oury one year in office. They bore
a great resemblance to the tribunes of the people among
the Romans. Their authority was very great. They
could oblige the inferior magiltrates, and even the
kings themfeclves, to render an account of their ad-
miniffration; and they could arrest and imprison the
persons both of the finators and of the kings. A re-
markable initance of this power happened in the cafe of
Pausanias .

The mnoit important article respecting the private po-

licy of the Spartans, was the equal diltribution of the
lands. Lycurgus, when he began his reformation,
finding the whole territory of the (tate in the hands of
a few wealthy citizens, used his utmofit endeavorurs to
prevail with those citizens to relinquish their poffefli~ons,
and to consent to an equal division of the lands among
the whole members of the commonwealth. In thiis ar-
duous work, he was lucky enough at last to succeed.
The whole territory of Laconia was distributed into
30,000 thares, and assigned to the inhabitants of the
country ; and the liberties of Sparta were, in like mnan-
ner, divided into 9000 shares, and allotted to the wnha-
bitants of the city. Each thare contained as much
ground as was judgerd fufficient fo~r the fabliftence of one
family; which was computed to requir-e about seventy
burhels of grain, and a proportionabler quantity of wmne
and oil.

To remove likewise, as far as possible, all pretenflons

to diftin~tion that might arise from an ineqluality in
point of moveable effeiits, Lycurgus prohibited~ the dfe
of gold and silver, and obliged the Spartans to confine
themselves to iron ·money alone, of which the weigjht
and small intrinsic value must render its ufTe extremnely
difficult. By these means he banished luxury and mag-

y 3 nificence,

mificence, brought riches into co~ntempt, and made mo:
defty and finiplicity to be honoured and effeemed. It is
vain to pretend to reason about the rationality of these
eftablithments of Lycur!·us, since it is certain, thiat while
Sparta retained hier contempt for riches, the continued
powe~rf~ul and glorious.

Sill farther to prevent the derfire of riches, and all in-

estements to luxury, Lycurgus prohibited the praatice
of all luperfluous and unncceffary arts at Sparta, antd
all public thows, that his citizens might not be accu-
firm~ed to fG~hth condemned by the laws, nor listen even
to ah indirea juffification of crimes and irregular pas-
flous. In place of fach occupations and amufmnents,
hunting, and bodily exercjifs, were encoiuraged, and
constituted the ordinary diversion of the Spartans.

To co~mplete this fyfltem of equality that Ly curgus

desired to ditabhf~h among his countrymen, his last
and most effeaual inflitution was that of the public
tables, at which all he citize ns, rich and poor promnif-
cuoufly, were obliged to eat of the fame diet. Every
table contained fifteen persons, each of shorn furnithed
a certamn quantity of the requisite provisions. A~ bufhlel
of flour, eight gallong of wine, five poiunds of *cheese,
two pounds and a half of figs, togeth~er with a finall fum
of monley to purchafie a little f tfh and fish-, and to cook
the vic~uals, was the. monthly contribution of every
mT~embe ~~r. No new member could be admitted to any
of those tables without the confernt of the whole com-
pany. From rtheir entertainmnents all delicate luxurioos
dithes were banifhetd; their ordinary and mast citeemed
falre belmg: a fort of black broth s.,

T'his

* D~iony~ius, the tyrant of Syracure, being informed of the extra-

or-dinary fon~drnes of the Spjartanls for this black broth, is said to
have- procur~ed a Spartan cookt for the single purpole of preparing it
for hzrn. E~ut the tyrant on taffing it, having ihown great dislike
to It, the cook, wi;th the i·ronrg £1nfe of his niative laconicifmn, told
D~ionyflus, It hat one muff bathet in the Eurotas before he coiuld -ac-
qluire the proper tass e or this brlt h.--i nfi nuating, by his observation,
that one rrouff sarre as abittrrvioufly, and use as viol!ent exercifq, as a
Spartan did, before he could relish their favourite broth.

This last regulation met with much opposition, and

occationed an inf~urreation, in which Lycurgus had one
of his eyes knocked out. But the gentleness with
which he treated the author of that misfortune, very
much increased the public est~eem for himn; and the re-
gulation at last took place. The public tables soon be-
came so many schools of temperance and initma~ion to
the youth.

But of ail the instit-utions of Lycurgus, the most ex-

t~raordinary, perhaps, and the molt: wife, were those
that regulated the education of the children, which he
justly regarded as the ground-work and basis of his
whole fyltem of government. His care in that refped
may be said to have preceded not only -the birth, but e-
ven the conception of the children, by the firiat atten-
tion he beffowed on procuring them healthy and vigo-
rous mothers. Fo~r this purpose, the Spartan young
women. were from their earliest years accuffomed to a
couri of- hardy and laborious exercises, proper for in-
vigorating the body, such as wrestling·, running, and'
throwing the javelin. These exercises, too, inspired
them with a s~pirit of emulation and heroifin, and im-
proved their minds no less than their bodie. Hence
the softer Sex, which, in the modern nations inhabiting
our hemisphere, seems to be naturally aRuated with a
desire of outivard ornament and dress~, to attradt the ad-
miration of the other sex, at Sparta aspired at the most
manly accomplifhmlents. Their education there ren.
dered them susceptible of the most heroic virtues; and
that to foch a drgree, that the love of their country of-;
ten extinguish3ed the powerful ties of natural affedtion.
The mo~ther, who heard that her son had fallen in the
service of his country, anxiounly examined the body, to
fee wIhether he had received his wounds before or be-
hind : in the former cafe the rejoiced, in the latter the
wrept.

Nor were the Spartan maidens permitted to receive

huibands till they arrived at the flower of their age :--
An inltance of singular wisdom in their excellent law-

F 4 giver,

giver. HE~is sagacity was no less consp~icuous in contri-
ving things so, that their marriages were all clantdeftine,
and rather a rape than a formal conjunation. By- thele·
means the interviews b·-twe-en the new-married: couple
were few, difficult, and thort. Hence temperane in
their pleasures.

Every child, wh~en born, was examined by the oldest

man of its tribe; who, if they thought it too delicate
and weak, condetmned It to die. It is oblervable, that
the Spartan children thoug~h never wrapped in i[waddling
cloaths, were all remar kakly fir-aight, well proportioned,
.and beautiful. Their nurse-s were reckoned very care-
ful and skilful; and, on that account, were eagerly
fougfht after by the principal people in the other states
of Greece. ht is reported, that Alcibiadles was s~uckled
;by a Spartan.

As the education of the children was accounted too

important a concern to be intruffed to the palrents, who,
by an absurd and ill-judged fondne~ss, of ten ruin them,
the Rtate took that matter entirely into its own hands,.
A citizen of diltinguiihed integrity and ability was ap-
pointed principal fuperintendant of t!;e ediucation of the
youth At the age of seven yrars, the children were
taken fromn their parents, and diffriburted into diff -rent
classes, where th-ey were inured to a hardy life, exvpofed
to the extremnities of cold and heat, obliged to walk
barefoot, with their heads thaved and uncovered, and
accu ftcamed to the greateRt fmplicity and temperance in
their dirt,.

At -the age of twvelve they were remioved into another

class, ·where thcey undierwent a more frevere discipline
Htill 'I her e thry learned obedience to the ~laws and
magdi~rates, and reverence for their, old men. o n
spire the m withl bravery, and- to render them expert at
thEi rxerc~ifes of war, they were obligerd to fight with one
anw, heir In rithere contdit s thecy uled to contend with
fuich fury and nbalin::cs, as of~ten to have some of their
membl~ers ditab:led, andi fo-ne~timues even to be killed. To
mazke thzem adventurous and cunning, they were allo-nr ed

ed to Real whatever they pleafcd, either from the gar.
dens or public halls of entertainiment, pro~vided they ac-
compliithed the the~ft· without bein~g dete~ted ; but when

dren to be able: to bear, without complaininlg, at a cer-
tain feast in honour of D~iana, mle mioff fever - whipping,.
even till the bloo~d followed the firoke. Tlheir under-
flandings were cultivated mo~re by the conversation of
the wisest citizenls, than by Rudy and reading. They
were particularly taught to give their anfwe rs in the few-
eft~ words pofirble. H-ence concif= ness, eithrr inl (tyle
or conversation, has obtainred the name of L~aonic~ifm.
By these means a single fyblable fomletime~s Icrve~d amnong
the Lacedemonians for an answer.

The love of their country was the chief sentiment

with which the Spartans laboured to inspire t heir youth ;
and the science of war was almost their only i;tady. For
it appears to have been the intention of Lycurgus to
form a nation of focldiers ; no~t indeed that thiey might
indulge themselves in a spirit of conqueit, and by that
means give way to ambition and injuffice, which he e-
vidently meant to prevent, by prohibiting their making
use of any naval force ; but that they mlight be able to
maiwrain the peace and liberties of thleir native country
against turbulent and ambitious ne~ighbours. Tlheir
first and principal lesson in the art of war was, Never
to jpy, let the enemy outnumber themn ever so much;
but eithe-r to die or to conquer. iChof~e whorr fled in any
engagemlent, w~ere rendered infamous fotr ever, and
might be inf~ul eJ by any person with impunity. An-
other singular, but very political maxim observed by
the Spartans in war was, Never to purfre a vanquished
eneiiy betyond the field of battle. For this reason their
adversar~ies being ture of finding fatety in flight, were
mnduced to fight wilh less oieftinncy. War, inltead of a
hardship, was by the Spartans considered as a recrea-
tion; for then, and at no other time, the extreme ri-

1 g~our!

gour airdl severity of their us~ual course of life was in a
g~ood measure relaxred.

*Wie cannot conclude this article, without observing,

that to le~veral emlinent writers so~me of the Spartan cu-
ftom-s an~d infitattions have appeared· reprehensible.
Certain public exhib~itions of.cheir young womnen are
cendtured as indelicate :--And an article of freedom in
an essential point allowed to their. married women, is
c·ondemned as immloral, and as being subversive of one
of the most powerful b~onds of paternal and of filial as.
feti~on .

We know, that to the first it may be anfwvered by a

certain class~ of philosophers, Tlhat this apparent indeli.
cacy is only a consequence of the corruption of the man-
ners of those~ who account it such; while, on the other
fide, it is a proof of the innocence and fim plicity of the
Spartan maonnrs To the second the anfrwer is more
obvious, and perhaps more solid, That at S~parta filial

bers: A circumitance which distinguishes Spartan polity
f6rom that of every other nation, so far as we k~rnow,
which ever appeared on earth.,

Their cruelty, both as individuals and as a communi·

ty, is made another fubjea of reproach against the an-
eient Spartans: And indeed it freems to be altogether
without excure. 'To destroy s~uch of their children as
the infpeators judged to be too puny and weak, wkas
both cruel, and, we will venture to add, absurd. Dai·
ly experience might have convinced them, that an en-
feebled appearance in the firit days of life is far f'rom
being an unequivocal sign even of bodily firength. Innu·
merable instances to the contrary occur daily in all coun-
tries. jBut, even in a nation of Spartan warriors, an a-
thletic make could hardly be put in competition with
bravery, which depends more on the mind than on the
body, and, like underi~tanding, fancy, memory, and
other mental endowments, is most rarely communicated

to an Herc~ulean frame. Of this the illuitrious Sparta4
Agefilaus furnishes a conymncmg proof.

But the'ir more than savage barbarity to the Helots,

who tilled their fields, and on whomn of course rhey de-
pended for the means of life, thocks law~nanity, and al-
molt exceeds belief. They no~t only ·otilged themu to
wear, on all occasions, both in their dress and de~port-
m-ent, the most dlifgraceful mnarks of abjeat servility, but
daily insulted, struck, and maimned rthem, without a tha-
dow of provocation ; and, often In pure wantonners, itao.~
bed them to death.

The horrid amusement of the Cryptia or amzbufcade,

not only permitted, but even authoritatively imnpoted on
the youth, is an` initance of unprecedentedi, of incon-
ceivable barbarity. Parties of the hardieft young Spar.
tans, armed with dahggrs concedte d undrr their cloaths,
were dispatched to traverse the fields, evidently with a
view to mark out foch of the Helots as appeared to pof~-
fess molt firength and courage, and the most manly ap.
pearance in face or gesture. Hiaving made their obfere
vations, they concealed th-emselves in the most unfre.
quented places, till night gave themn an opportunity to
perpetrate the: meditated massa~cre. T1.hen sa8llying ~forth
foro their lurking-places, they flabbed with their dag-
gers the devoted unifuFpeamlg wrctches.

O~n the whol'e, the· Spartan conflitution seems to have

been devifbed to render them a nation of hardy, unteel-
ing warriors. Every circumitance dee~med conducive to
this end, was fludied and prac'ifed, though frequently
repugnant to the softer and rnolt amiable fe~elings of the
hum~an mind. But what cannot habit effedt among
mankind ? T~fhe manncrs not only of dist~ant nations,
but even of thi fame nations in ~different ag~es, differ as
much as the motions of a tumbler ditfer from those of a
laborious peasant.

So extraordinary a people soon attrafte~d the admira-

tion of thrir neighbour~s, as well as of ithangers; and

vantag~e to obtaiti a Spartan for their general, and paid
him the most perfe~t obedience.

Most of the ancient philosophers were of opinion, that

the governmnent of Sparta aFppoached the nearest of any
to perferaion, as comlprehending all the advantages, and
excluding all the disadvantages, of the other forms of
government. It is indeed certain, that while the initi.
tutions of Lycurgfus were maintained in their full vigour
in Sparta, no se~dition ever broke out there; no privats-
man poffeffe~d himself by violence of the supreme power;
and no king afirumed more authority than the laws per-
mitted.,

SEC T. 11.

TO form. an accurate notion of the form of gfoverni

ment in the Athenian republic, it is necessary to

know dliftin~tly the different memnbers whereof it was
composed.

The inhabitants of Athens were diftingulfhed into

three diff~erent ranks; the citizens, the thangers, the
slaves .

Those only were naturally citizens, who were born

of Athenian parents, both free. Foreigners indeed
mlight becorne citizens by the indulgence of the people,
who had the power of conferring that honour on fouch
as had rendered signal s~ervice to the slate. All the citi-
zens were by Cecrops distinguish~ed into four tribes:
cach of those tribes consisted of three divirions; and
each division wasfiubdivided intothirty famiies. About
1 co years after Solon, this diff ribution of the citizens
was altered by Clisthenes, who increased the number
of tribes to ten ; in which situation they continued till
the time of Demetrius Poliorcetes, when they were
further increased to twelve. T~he young men were not
admitted to the rank, nor intitled to any of the privileges
of citizeIns, till the age of twenty years. Then after
Cwearing in the most solemn manner never to fly from

Jbattle,

battle, to defend their country to their last breath, and
to advance its honour and glory with all their might,
they were inrferibed in the lift of citizens. Thie whole
power of government was exclusively confined to the
iotizens alone.

Such firangers as f~ettled at Athens, either for the
fakle of commerce, or from any other motive, always
Put themselves under the prote~tion of some citizen.
They were obliged to pay a tax to the slate, and were
[nbjeft to its laws; but had no thare in the govern.
ment.

The third class consisted of two divisions : a ft, The
fervantfs, who, though free by birth, were conltrained
through poverty to gain a livelihood by serving the o*
ther citizens : And, 2dly, The slaves, properly so call-
ed, who were either prisoners taken in war, or were:
purchased with money. The last lived in a Rtate of ab-
foute dependence on their matters, and were ac-count-
edl part of their property. W~hen treated with cruelty,
they had a right to complain to the proper magiffrate;
~and on proving what they alleged, their masters were
obliged to dispose of them. A certain proportion of
their gains was appropriated to their own use. They
might purchase their liberty, though conitrary to the
pleasure of their matters; and their masters might vo-
luntarily set them at liberty whenever they thought pro.

We have seen in the preceding part of this history,

that the Athenians were at first ruled by kings. W~e
have seen them upon the death of Codrus asserting their
liberty, taking the whole power of government into
their own hands, and setting up principal magiffrates of
their own creation, called Archons. ~e have fleen them
limiting still more and more the power of those Ar-
·chons; first reducing the duration of their oflice to ten
years, inlitead of conferring it for life, as at firit; and
afterwards confining it to the space of one year.

Sensible at last of~ the numberless inconveniences at-

tending this unsettled: Ltate of government, -they un a ni-

moumfly

moaufly etupowered S~olon to; make fathk alterationP in it
as he tho~uld judge proper, and to bring the m'anner of
proceeding in their public deliberations to a regular and
·permane-nt form.

Aware of the turbulent and licentious difpolition of

the people with whom he had to deal, Solon accepted
of the <>,ff ice with re luaance. Naturally averse himself
to despotic iwayz, and inclined to the free and equal rule
of a well regulated democracy, knowing perfeatly at the
fame time the impossibility ofreconciling the A~thenians
to any other mode of lubjeaion, he devised for them a
form of government purely popular. But. as he was
well acsquainted with the many dangers and imperfec.
tions incident to that lyftien, he endeavoured, by every
polib~le preCaution, to obviate them as far as he could.

Solon would willingly have begun his adminiffration,

by eftablithing at Aithens the f~ame equality ini point of
fortune that prevailed at Spalta. But foreseeing the
danger of l~ilch an attempt in his circumfitances, he re-
solved to takre a middle course, and to procure an ac-
~quittal of all drbts then tubfifting among the citizens.
By that means he dehvuered from sla~very a great number
of citize-ns. whose exc~ live debts had obliged them to
part with their treedom;~ and at the fame trme he firuck
at the root of mzoft of the commotions that had of late
diflurbed the Rtate, which were produced by the rigour
of :he richer citizens in exuating their debts, and by the
refraaocry difpolition and the inability of the poorer fort
to pay them.

Solon next proceeded to rank all the citi2:ens into

four classes, in proportion to the wealth of each. The
fir ft hree classe~s co~mpr-ehended the richer citizens, who
alone were to be promoted to all the offices of tru t or
dignity in the Rtare. The fourth class contained the
poorer citizens, w ho, though excluded on account of
their. poverty trom poffs and employments, had nrever-
thelef~s the privilege of votingf in the public affemnblies;
which, as we shall by and by fee, evrrntually threw into
their hands the whole power of the Rfate : for as this

class

class comprehended a greater number of persons- than
the ot'her three together, they poffelffed a preponderancy
of: voices on all occasions. Afterwards, too, this ex-
clufion of the poor~er fort from public offices, was abo-
lifhed by the interposition of Aristides, and full liberty
was: granted to the mcean~eft citizen, of arriving at any
office whatev-er.

Solon next laid down rules about the form of pro-

ceeding in the public as~semblies. These assemblies were
composed, as we have already observed, of the whole
colleative body of the citizens ; each of whom not only
-migh~t, but was obliged to afirft at them. Their meet-
ings were of two kinds, ordinary and extraordinary.
The ordinary meetings were appointed to be holden on
certain fixed days ; and the particular business that was~
to come under the consideration of each meeting was
properly known and ascertained. The: extraordinary
meetings were called by public proclamation, when any
matters occurred whose nature or importance required
more solemn consideration or quicker dispatch. Every
meeting was opened with sacrifices and prayer; after
which the president explaine~d the matter about wlhich
they were to deliberate. If the question had been pre-
vioufly agitated in the senate, in the manner that we
ihall afterwards deferible, the opinion there given was
read; and the people were asked, W~hether they thought
proper -to confirm it ? If they demurred, those who
chose to deliver their s~entiments about the affair were
desired to as~cend the tribunal. The oldest members ge-
merally spoke first. When the pleadings were conclu-
ded, the people gave judgment by holding up their
hands, in sign of approbation of the opinion or proposal
laid before them. But if a majority g~ave not this sign,
the proposal was rejea~ed. After the pleasure of the
assembly was thus known, their featence was reduced
mnto writing, was then read over to them, and was con-
firmed a Second time.

The whole power of the commnonwealth, both legiT-

.lative and judicativ~e, was vested in these popular affem- blies.

blies. For not only were all matters of public concernj
foch as the enafting and abrogating of laws, religious
affazirs, the creation of magiffrates, and inquiries into
t-hei~r admilniffration, peace, war, tr~eaties, and the re.
wards of fGenal services done to the fltate, dikcuffed in
them : but every quefition of private right might be
tried before them, by appeals fi-ro all the judicatories
in the republic.

As Tome fort of restraint, or rather as a dire~tory to

the popular aiffemblies, Solon inltituted the senate;
w~hich he formed of a oo mlen chofetn out of each tribel
and the tribes in his timle being four, the wrhole ruera
bers of the senate amounted, by conse-quence, to 4oo.
Their number, however, was afterwards increased to
500, upon the i~n'creafe of the numb~er of tribes to ten,
ab~u~t a oo years after Solon, when each tribe was al-
lowed to furnish 50 members to th~e senate. They were
all chosen by lot. But no man could become a senator
before the age of thirty, nor till firia inq~uiry was made
into his private chara~ter;i and belore his admifiron, he
bound himnfelf by oath to give judgment in every que.
fl~ion according to law, and.to deliver at all times to the
-people of Athens the best counsel that occurred to hin,
Every member of the senate received a s~alary out of the
public treaflury. The -president was el~e~ed out of each
tribe in rotation.

The fi-nators, before af~femblingf, sacrificed to Jupiter

and Mercury. It was the prefident's business to lay be~
fore the senate the quefitions on -which they were to de-
liberate. Each judge flood up in his~rurn, and deliver·
ed his opinion. TLhe manner of itating the question be-
ing agreed on, it was written out and read aloud. T'he
judges proceeded to give their votes by throwing either
a black or a white bean into an urn. If thle number of
white beans exceeded that of the black, the sentence
paffetd in the affirmative; if the number of black beains
was greatest, it was reje~ted. But before the decree of
the s~enate could have the force of a law, it required the
approbation ch the assembly of the people, before whom

there·

the~eit next came. If affirmed by them, it passed
into a law ; if not, it was only good for a y7ea~r. This-
council was, as already mentioned, intended by Solon
as ·a check upon the as~sembly of the people ; which be-
ing ~for :the greater· part composed of a confused multil
tude, without education, capacity, or much zeal for
the pshic good, flood in need of fach an infitution to
informn and direa2 them, to fix thei~r incouff~ancy, to
prevent their temerity, and to hbeffow on their d~elibe-
rations a prudence and maturity to which the muiltitude
nec~effariity were firangers. For this reason the most
important matters of the slate, fouch as those relating to
p-eace, war, the army, the navy, and the public funds,
were firdt agitated in the senate, and brought ~before the
popular a~ssemblies only in the second instance.

The next considerable ac' of Solon's admi~nistration

w~as the inflitution, or rather perhaps the reformation,
of the court of Areopa~gus. The power of this court
was,' proper~ly s~peaking, purely judicative. It was com-
peed -o~f the Archons, who had served the slated time
za that capacity, an~d had dik~harged the duty of -their
Office with ~diftinguilhed intergrity and reputation. The
number of judges in this court was not fixed. Some-
tim~es they amounted to two or three hundred. The
coulrt of Areopagus never met but at night, and in an
open place; and those who pled before them were not
permitted to indulge t-hems~elves in declamation, but
war~e firi~tly confined to th~e merits of their caus~e.

This co~urtr was always molt 'highly refpe~ted, on ac-

count of the singular juffice and integrity of the judges,
~who were in~truffed wit~h the education of the youth,
wiNth thhe car~e of the p~ublic .money, and with power to
punitih those who lived in idlenes~s. They had likewis~e
j~urifditlion in matters of religion, and deliberated about
the introdualion of new divini-ties, and the building of
tempes and altars. Besides the matters here enu~mera-
~ted, they meddled with no other, unles~s upon particular
application of the sl~ate, which fametimes had recourse

G to

to t'he wisdom of their deliberations on any dangerous
emnergncy.rv

.It were equally tedious and unnecessary to enter into
a particular -detail of* the various subordinate inflitutions
of Solon. TC~e hope that what has been said rnay give
the reader a diltirit notion of the public governmnent
of this famous republic, and that is all we propof'ed ".

ART ILL

Of the educcation of the youth, thie ganies and fboreis, mah

ters of wrar andz re~ligion among the Greeks.

OF all the branches of G-recian politys that which

regarded the education of their youth was the

mofit admirable. Toi the wisdom of thof'e ancients in
this refped, may be cl'2ie~fly attributed the vast fuperi-
ority in point of charaaer and ability of the individuals
among them over those of modern times. To treat this
f~ubjea with the accuracy its importance re~quires, would
be a work equally laborious and useful. Buit as it is in-
compatible with our prelent design to enter into a mi-
nute ikveftigation of this matter, we shall content our-
selves with giving a general view of it in as few words
las pofi~ble.

Among the Greeks, the education of the youth was

a branch of government; and for that purpose public
exercises were appointed, both for forming the bordyj!
and for improving the mind.

Their bodily excercifes wnere principally calculated to

inure them to the fatigues of war. Proper schools were
set apart for the performance of those exercises, and
ikilful matters wNere appointed by the public to oversee

G 2 them.

them. Th~ere the youth praailred wre~ling, riding, the
use of armns, and m'ilitary evolutions. Hunting too,
which is an imasge of wvar, was in' great repute, and
v~ery highly encouraged by the ancients. In thre ctourfe
-of that diverflon, t-he youth. were accuffouriedt to sup-
port the most violent fatigue, cold, heat, and all the
other. varieties of the weather; hunger, thirit, and hard
journies. For this reason Kenopho~m, one of the fi-nest
writers that Greece produc~d, who with the sci~ence of
a ph~ilosopher united the (kill of an exc~ellent commander,
-a thorou~gh knowliedge -of the wo~rl-d and thie politeness
of a gentleman, thought it worth his while to compose a
t-reatise on the art of hunting ; and in his beautiful philo-
fophical romance, the Cyropedela, he takres frequlent occa-
sion to launch forth into the. praises of it, and to thow,
in the~ persona of his hero,, to what useful purposes it
;Ccnt ribulz;te s.

Danc~ng~, too, was reckoned an effental part in the

education of thle ancient Greeks. Its principal aim with
.thezn, vas to beffow on the body an unacon'itr~ained and
easy motion, and a graceful air. To exrcel in it, there-
fore, was accounted an accomplithment worthy the
grav~ei and greatest char-a~ers. Hence even Epami.
nondas, one of the most pe~rse: charai~ers :that Greece
ever produiced, was praise~d for da~ncing gracefully, and
for playing skilfully on the slate.

Mzyfc, which holds, a middle rank between the exer.

cifes of the body and the qualifications of the exind, was
likewise carefully cultivated by the Gireeks, and confi-
dered as a necef~ary and polite accomplifihment~. The
ancients indeed aleribed to this art the most wotd~erfult
effeats, believing it capable to foolth the paflions, to sos-
ten the manners, and even to humanize bar-barous and
savage dispositions. On thi~s account Socrates himfielf
was not ashamed, whT~en pretty far advanced in yearsr
to learn to pl~ay upon musical infiruments : And Themi-
flocles, otherwise~ so well accomplithed, was thought
deficient in merit, because he could not touch the lyre.
Even Plato, the gravelt philosopher of antiquity, deerix ed

·edthefe twao arts of dancing and music so important,
that in h~is books of laws, he takes much pains to pre-
scribe proper rules with regard to them. B~ut the taste
of the Greeks, in thes~e two articles, was at length cor-
rupted and depraved by the extreme licentioufnels o~f
their theatres, where both music and dancing were by
the comedians applied to the purpole of exciting the
loof~efti and most thamneful pafEions.

Gre~ece was the nursery and the residence of every

-bran~ch of polite learning, of arts, and of sciences. E-
-very fludy that depends on the powers of imagination,
or· the faculties of the underfianding, was there carried
to the summit of perfettion. Hence their ·youth applied,
with the utmos~t afirduity, to the fludy of mathematics,
philosophy, poetry, 'and eloquence, and were early in-
firufed by thE best masters in the principles of their na-
tive language ( of which the various beauties were care-
fully pointed out to them. By these means the Athe-
nians in particular imbibed that exquified takte for the
Irefinements of language, which has been the wonder of
succe3eding ages.

But the acquisition they valued the most, and which

was the obje~t of their warmest ambition, was elo-
quence. This indeed, in popular governments like
theirs, was of all qlualifications the mloft us~eful, being
the path that condu~ted to the highest offices -of the slate,
and raised those who excelled in it to the most diitin-
gulfhed rank among their fellow-citizens.

Before the time of Socrates, the sciences were chiefly

taught by masters called Sophips, a vain pres~umptuous
set of men, who were eternally difrputing and boaffmng of
their knowledge. The excellent philosopher just men-
tioned took great pains to dete~t their ignorance, and
to expose them to ridicule. Th'lis provoked them agfainft~
him; and we shall by and by fee, that he owed his de-
firu~tion in a great measure to the resentment of those
Soph~ifts.

The games and combats, so much. in use among the
Greksw~ere principally encouraged on account of

G; 3 tlhei-

their being so admirably calculated for rendering the
·bodies of the youth robust and vigorous, and for ena.
bling theme to support the fatigues of war ; and like wife
ch account of their forming a part of their religious wor.
thip. Of there exercis~es the famous heroes of antiquity,
fpuch as Hercules, Theseus, Caster, and Pollux, vcirere the
origmnal mventors : and the greatest poets aspired at
glory by celebrating the praises of those who conquered
and exrcelled in them. In proces~s of .time, public in.
fIru~tors in these exercises aros~e, who formed a separate
profefiron by themfelvses, and often made an oft~ental
tious display of their fkIill, by contending with one an-
other in public.

Of these games there were four principal and more

solemn exshibitions, viz. the Olympic, the Pithian, the
Nemean, and the Isthmic.

T~he Olympic games were the most famous of all.

Their first institut~or is unknowrn, though P~elops is with
a great deal of probability generally considered as fach.
No particular time was at firRt set apart for their cele-
bration. But about the year before Chr~ist 784, Iphitus,
king of Elis, fixred it to every fourth year. Thes~e games
were consec~rated to Jupiter; and were performed in the
neighbourhood of Olym-pia, a city in the~ diffridt of
Pisa. An Olympiad was a period of four years, being
the s~pace of time th~at intervened between one celeb~ra-
rtion and another. Ancient authors reckon their chro-
nology altogether by Olymnpiads, beginning at the Q-
lympiad which happened in the year before Christ
776.

There more solemn Igames were no doubt at first e.

fkablifhed by the Gr~eeks, as well with a view to drawv
together the leading men in the different slates of
Greece, that they might have an opportunity of deli·
beratinig on matters of general concern, as to inspire
the youth with a love of glory. The Greeks exerted
their utmost efforts to support the magnificeni-e of thefs
games, which were regularly celebrated while that
~eople Tnaintainged their liberty. The vast concourse of

[pge y

[peaators that constantly flocked thiither, inspired the
combatants with the higaheft spirit of emulation ; and.
to come off vialorious was effeemed the greatest glory.
According to Horace, ~viatory there raised the conquer-
ors to the rank of gods. The year was diftinguithed
by the name of the conqueror in the chariot races, ac-
counted the -most honourable of all, and his praises
were sung by the most famous poets.-T-lhe prize was a
crown of laurel.
.Running was considered as the principal exercis~e at
the Olympic games; which therefore always opened
with the foot races. The course .was called the
Stadiulm, from the measure of that name, containing
about 600 feet, which was originally the whole space
set apart for the performance of all the ex~ercises. But,
in. proces~s of time, not only the particular spot within
which the difputants contended, but likewise that oc~cu-
pled by the O~pc~ators, was, called· by that appellation,
though perhaps exceeding the extent of several ftiadia.--
In the middle of the Rtadium, were difplayed' the differ-
ent prizes destined for the via~ors. A.t one extremity
of the lifts was placed the barrier or starting place,
formed by a cord extended ; without which were ran-
ged the runners, and also the chariots. T`he drawing
of this cord was the signal for starting. At the other
extremity~ of the lifts was placed the goaT for those whlo
ran.

The runners were drawn up in a: straight line, and

the inoment the signal was given, they hurried towards
the goal with wonderful rapidity. In the fliorte(1 race,
he who arrived firSt at the goal was declared the via-"or :
But there was a longer race; in which, after reaching
the goal, they returned to the barrier. Besides there,
there were others of greater earent still; and, in the
.longest of all, the difputants were obliged to double
the goal no fewer than twelve times.

Florfe-races, though holden in a considerable degree

of effimation, were not so common : And, indeed, in
·those ancient times, when the us~e of itirrups was. un-

GC 45 known,

known, it~ must have required very great dex~terity to
contend in them.,

The chariot-races were the most famous of a~ll; not

Sonly because ancient prin ces. and heroes generally fought
from chariots; but likewise, because those who con-
tended for the prize in that exercise, at .the Olympic
games, were persons of the noblest birth, or distinguish-
ed by the greatne~s of~ their exploits. Two kring~s of
Syracus~e, Gelo an~d H~iero, and Philip of M-acedon, ac-
counted their havi-ng obtained the palm of viatory in
this dispute among their highest honours. T~hose cha.
riots were drawn by two or four hors~es qoked. a-brea t-.
Hence the wor'd~s bigae (a two-horfe cLarriag~e), rand
quad~rigae, (a four-horfe carriage.) All the chariots
set off- together from the itarting-place, called carceres,
the instant the signal was given. The Rtation of each
was f~ettled by lot; for some Rtations weire much more
advantageous than others ; thole, for example, that
were ranged on the left, were nearer the goal, around
which they were obliged to turn, than those ranged on
the right, which had a larger circuit to perform; but
the Rtations occupied by each, before ftrarting, were
neceif arily altered in the - course of the race ; for the
fleetest horses, and most: skilful charioteers, would cer-
tainly takre poffeffion of the most conlvenient itations.
Of all the Athenians, Al~cibiades was the snoft ambi-
tious to distinguish himse~lf in there games. For that
purpose he kept a great number of horses; and once
sent no fewer than seven chariots to contend for thne
prize. On the day that he won the three fi~rit prizes,
he gave a grand enitertainment to all the fpetaators,
wlho must have formed a vast mrultitude. Tfhefe vic-
tories of Alcibiades were immortalized by a famous ode
com~pos~ed by the celebrated Euripides.

It was not necessary for th~e disputant in the chariot-

rTaces to condua~ his chariot in person. It was fuffcient
if he were pres~ent; or even if he sent thith~er his hors~es.
TfLhus Philip was at Potidea, when~ he received the news
p9s his yiaory in the chariot races at the Olympic games.·

It-may be oblerved too, that even women were permtted
to contend for the prize in that dispute. We~ learn frona
hithory, that CynifCa, the fiffer of Ageflaus king of
Sipar~ta, was the first woman who set the example s and
tha~Lt the gained the viao-ry in the race of the chariots
dirilwn by four borfes.

Ifvei recerived a palm- into his han~dj and was cond~uaed
rthrough~ the Rtadium by a herald, who proclaimed him
vi~tkarf by the found of a trumpet. This was caccom-
paniedb by loud thuouts from the fpe~tators. On returnE-
ing to hsis native city, he made his entry through a
breach in the wall, thrown down for that speci~al pur-
pose, mounted' on a chariot drawn by four horses, all
his fellow-citizens goi~ng out to meet him.--Viaory in
the chariot-races was, as alrea-dy observed, effeemed the
moit honourable of all; and hifforians distinguished, each
Olympiad by the namne of him who had won the frirt
prize in that dispute.

T'he combats of the Athl~eae, or the Gymnastic ex-
earcifes, formed the remaining part of the entertainment
at the Olymp~ic games. The Athletae prepared th~em-
selves for this public exhibition of their ifrengthi and
dexterity by a regular education ; and none but free
Greek's, of irreproachable moral charaders, were ad-
mitted into their number. They were obliged, pre-
vioufly to their appearing at the public games, to Epend
ten months in the Gymnafia; where, under the direc-
tionl of proper mnafters appointed for the purpos~e, they
observed the most rigid temperacce, to harden their
bodies, and to adapt them to the requisite 'exercifes.
Before engaging, the Athletae had their bodies care-
fully rubbed and anointed, that their limbs and joints
nught thereby be rendered muore ikbrong and pliable :
irad they fought quiite= naked, to give less hold to their
adversaries.

Those who presided at ther~e games were called Ag-

totherae.

The various exercises in which the Athletae contend-

c d,

ed, were, wRrefiing; - boxing; - th Pancratium;..
throwing the dikcus;--and jumping.

Wtlreftling is an exercise every where. so well known,

that it were superfluous to spend many words in giving

a deferpton of it.--Each contending party pra~tifed his

utmolt$ frength, agility, and address, to throw down
his adversary. But if he who was thrown down carried
his o~pponent along with him, -the dispute was not at an
end, for they still continued firuggling ; and he who
got uppermost at last, and obliged the other to demand
quarter, was declared conqueror.-Milon of Crotona,
and Polydamas, were the most renowned wreftlers of
all antiquity.

Boxing is an exercise pretty generally known like.

wife. In this exercif'e the combatants fought with their
sifts, which were armed with ceftufes, a fort of gaunt-
let or glove, composed of leather firaps lined with
plates of iron, to render the blows more violent; and
to preserve their heads from contusions, they wore a
fort of large cap. Sometimes, after contending a long
while, they were so exhauffed! by sweat and fatigue, as
to be obliged of concert to sus~pend the combat for a
little time, that they migfht draw breath, and refreih
Ithemf~elves. In these engagements,· they were some-
times frightfully disfigured, having all their body co·
vered w~ith miserable contusions, an eye knocked out,
or ·their jaw bones brokren; and sometimes the combat·
ant~s dropped down dead on the frpot.

The Pancratiumn required, as the word imports, the

whole firength of the body. It was a combination
both of wrestling and boxsin~g; for the combatants em-
ployed the firuggling pra~tifed in the one, and the
blows use~d in the other, They were at liberty even to
kick with their feet, and to make ofe of their teeth and
mails. Such combats justly appear to us barba~rous and
horrible, ,nearly as much so as thafe of the Roman gla-
'diators; and the fpeaato~rs weri certainly in a high de-
gree devoid of humanity, when they took pleas~ure to!

fee men endeavouring in this manner to disfigure, and
even to murder one another.

The dis~cus was an ex~ercise in which the difputants

exerted all their firength in throwing a piece ofitone or
lead, of a round form, and generally of such a weight,
that it was with difficulty carried in both hands. This,
like ,most of the other exrercifes, was calculated to
firengthen the body, that it might bear the more ea-
fily the burdens necessary to be carried in war. Their
posture, when they threw the smaller discus, was thus:=
They advanced one leg to a convenient distance before
the other, bended their body, and holding the discus
pois~ed on one arm, leaned their whole weight on the
;foremost leg;, thn, after two or three motions in the
manner they were to throw, in order properly to Iba-
lance their whole body, they difchiarged the discus. He
-who threw it farthest won the prize. But besides
.this, they had several other methods of throwing the
discus, generally making use of both arms at the fame
time.

Jumping and throwing the javelin were two exercises
in which the difputants endeavoured to jump, and to
throw the javelin the fartheit they possibly could ; and
he was vidt~or who threw it th~e far theft: of all.

Besides the exrercif~es above de-feribed, it was uiual at:

the Olympic games for tlwp-oets, and finest geniuites of
the times, to contribute still further to the public enter-
tainment, by reciting before that vast assembly some of
their best compositions. There Hierodotus publicly
read his hiffory ; which was so highly relished and ap-
plauded, that each of the nine books, whereof it con-
fifed, was honoured with the name of one of the nine
muses. In like manner Lysias the famous Athenian 0-
rator recited an oration, wherein he congratulated with
the Greeks on their having humbled the power of Di-
onyflus the tyrant. Several other orators likewise went
thither to read some ~favourite discourse.

.The vi~tors in those games had right of precedency
at all the public tho9ws. Besides this general indulgence,

they

they were particularly honoured at Spalrta,~ by the pri.
vilege of being maintained at the public charge, and of
fighting re~areft to the person of the king.--The praises
of the' vieftors were commonly the fabj~e t of the ·odes
cormpofed by the poets of those days. Pi~ndar and Si-
m~onides made this the the~me of a~ll their workrs of that

-The Pythiian games were celebrated at Delphoas every
fourth year, i'n honour of Apollo; and particularly in
memory of his vi~tory over the serpent Python. The
vi~tor in themI~ was crowned with Eaurel.

The ·Nemm~an games were celebrated every second

year at Nemmea, a city of the Peloponnese, in honour
of Hlercules, who had destroyed the lion that infefied
the forest of NJemama. Tlhe viEtor in them1 was cro~wned
with parsley.

The Ist~hmian games were celebrated- every fourth

year in the iithmus of Corinth, in honour of Neptune.
They were instituted by Theseus. The vi~tor in them
was crowned with pine leaves.

It is to be remnarked, tha~t during the celebration of

all these games, a general furpenfion of arms took place
through Greece, if at the time war happened to prevail
between any of the sl~ates.

One of the most famous combatants in the Gymna-

flIic exercise~s, of which we have been - just speaking,
was Mlcilo the Crotonian, so called from his beings a na-
tive of the city of Crotona.' He is renowned in hiffory
for his prodigious firength, and his great courage.
Wihen but a very young man, he was fix times via0r
at the Olympic games. The instances mentioned by
iifterians of his va~t t rength, and no les~s furrprifing
stomach, appear almost incredible. He is said to have
carried on his thoulders the whole length of a Rtadium
an ox four years old ; to have killed it with a single
blowr of his sift - and to have eaten the whole carcase in
one day. .His firength, however, proved at lait his
deftruEtion: for having attempted to· open entirely the
body of an oak tree, which he found a; little open al-

ready,

able; tot~ difenagage himnfelf, he was devo~ured by the wild

beingwaEll eas~ed ~to fee the -blemnithes in the charai~ers
of their Ifuperiors and cotemporaries exposed and cen-
sured By :the ingenious touches of pleafkatry and wit.
But we are justly surprised at the exrtreme licentionfnef~s of

·ofthe Athenian comic poets; for they not only made the
anoft illuffrious charaders of their age the butt of their
ridicule, but even meddled with the charaaters of their
gods. They likewise presumed to touch on Rtate affairs;
and introduced the faults of igovernment as the fubjea
of their mirth and pleasantry. ·-This excessive licens
tiodfnef~s was one of the consequences of the popular
form of government.

Eupolis, Cratinus, and Ariffophanes, were the most

famous of the Greek comic poets; but of the two firlt
none of the perfor~mances have come down to ris, and only
a few of those of the latter. --;In the time of Lysander
and the thirty tyrants, the satirical liberty which had
till then prevailed on the flage was gre'atly restrained,
The poets, howeveri, eluded the force of the injun~tion
given them, not to mnention any person by name, by
drawing the charaater in To firikiing a manner, that the
audience had no difficulty to find out the person aiimed
.at. But at last, in the time of Alexander the Great, the
poets were entirely prohibited from attacking any living
charader in their comedies, either direatly or indiredtly,
They were obliged therefore to have recourse to fiftion,
and to devise adventurers for their theatrical perfonagesl
Comedy then became a copy of the living mannenr
of the age in general.

The theatre of the Greeks confiftedl of three principal

divisions. The firit, destined for the rpedtators, andL
denominated the theatre, in a more firiat and con;
fined ~sense, was in the for-m of a semicircle, and disposed
in the manner of an amphitheatre, containing three
fl~ories of feats above one another, of which the highest
reached to the top of the building. Each flory confiff*
ed of sev~en rows of feats, separated from one another by
a landing place. The flories of feats were divided from
each other by three ranges of very large 'porticoes,
which compoSed the body of the amphitheatre. Be*
sides these, there were great square openings in proper
places, called vomitoria, by which the people entered
and retired; and Rlairs called cunaei, becaule each of

2 them

~thiem formed a fort of corner conduating to the several
floiries of feats.

Thbe Ce-cond diviflon was called the fcns, and con-

fifted~of two parts. The firRl of these, called in a more
litixited sense the jenaes, was of the form of a long
square ; and presented a large front, along which the
taitues and decorations were disposed. The other part
of this diirition was a large space in front of the scenes,
called by the Greeks projcenium:= but it might have been
in a- itric~er sense denominated the stage ; for it was
th~ere that the a~to~rs performed the piece.

T- he third diviflon, called the orchefira, was situat~ed

between the theatre and the ~scenes, and was ser apart
for the pantomimes, dancers, and musicians.
& The whiole edifice was open at top, and exposed to
the weather; -but was commonly covered with fails or
-large pieces of canvas, to preserve the fpe~tators from
the heat of thle fiun.

The passion of the Athenians for theatrical reprefenta-

t-ions ros~e at last to a kind of phrensy, and is accounted
onie of the principal caules of the corruption of their
manners. It must be allowed, that Pericles, from a de-
fire to conciliate the popular favour, was the firit who
lait the foundation of this corruption ; for, by procuring
a certain salary to each citizen every day that sacrifices
we-re performed, or plays exhibited, he very naturallyb
produced in the hearts of the Athenians a firong incli-
nation for the theatre. Feasts and plays succeeded each
osther alrinoft without inter million ; and the people, as a
c'onfequence of their taste= for shows and diversions, be-
came idle and indolent.

The taite, however, was reitrained within some fort

of bounds, till after the death of Epaminondas. The
Athenlians, finding themselves by that event delivered
from .a man whose talents had r~aised the Thebans to
such -a situation as to be able to dispute with them the
superiority in Greece; and who had, during his life,
kept them as well as the other sl~ates in constant a~tion;
and having then no other enemy to give them diflur-

bance,

money deftinect for the maintenance of their fleet and
arm~y. Wvhat t;aarccounltsblie delufian, to fqsuander away
in emp~ty amdfemsents such imnmenfe su.ms ; and to prefer
th-e love of pletaf~uee to the fafetyr of the flt~e and inte.
g~rity of mannrers ! Their enemies, and ~particularly
Philip kInrg of Mlacdon, did not fail to avail themselves
of ·this ~a~te of indolenc~e and difirpatio~n into which the
Athenians had fallen.

ed by their martial ·charaeae; of wrhic~h the -Trojan war,
where so mnany brave.chiefs ,gained immortal fame,: fur,
nifhed the first publ~ic djiplay,_. It is difficult to deter.
mpine., whether this warlikre temper was the cause or the
es f eft of hat itrong spirit of rbe~r ty with which we have
se~en them so univserfally aduate~d. But these twpo pas.
fions are certainly nearly allied, and mutt have greatly
cher-ilhed and ·heightened ·one another. This martial
clifpofiitioan, too, m~ust have been highly promoted by
·thbe pecualiar3 fitation of the country, d-ivided, as it was,
into a numnber of froa~ll Ratles, each .governed' by its own
laws, and influlenced by its particular c~h~ara~ter and in,·
te~rcit~s. Atccordingly, we ~fee, that amnbition and jea-
klady occafionied continual ~u~bjecAs of dispute amrong
thof~ Idifferent tatles, and kept them almost conf-Ltantl~y
at war with one anlother. Sparta andl Athens were on·
quefli~onably the chief of all the Grrecian :iates, and
rendered tthemfelves no less~ famous by their rivalithip
and their pe~p~etual fitru~ggles for su~perior·ity, th~an by theP
singularity and difference of their genius and manners.

3From wrhart has ·been already said in the former part

of this Appendix, the cause~ of the pre-e~minence of Spar-
ta anda Athe-ns over their neighbours is fufficiently ap-
parent. The wbole- aim of tihe ~Spartan :le~g~islator ap·
·pears to have -been to render his countrymen a nation
of soldiers. Every circumfitance of their education was
admirably calculated for that purpose. To go bar~efoot,
to lic h~ard, to ·eat .little, to fulfer every .extremnity pof the

a weather,

weter,.1rg to bear fatigue, and ~even wPounds, to exe~rcise
themselves continually at wrestling, running, hunting,
all contri'buted to that end. Their remarkable refped
for their magistrates and elders, and their perfeat sub-
mifierto to the laws, prepared them admirably for every
branch. of military dis~cipline. At Sparta too the mothers
wept only for such of their children as fled, not for
those that fell. All means, in a word, were pradite~d
to make the Spartans invincible in battle.

The bthenians, though not educated in to hardy a
manner, were neverthelef's animated with an equal spirit
of valooLr. Tfhe ancient glory of their nation, which
had' always * distinguished itself by its warlike aaiorns,
was s powerful incentive to bravery. A generous e-
mulation, not to yield in point of merit to their rivals
the Spartans, likewis~e served gready to promote the
martial temper natural to the Athenians. But above all;
the rewP~ards and honours beffowed on those who had be-
bavedd with remarkable \courage in battle; the monu-.
mtetts ere~ted to the memory of foch as had fall~en in the
f~ervite of their country; ·cand the- excellent funeral- ora-
tions publicly prbnounced -on the most ilfolemn occasions;
to; render the~ir names immortal, contributed wonder-
fully to keep alive the flame of valour, and to inspire
thetin with extraordinary bravery. This end was like-
wife greatly advanced by the attention fhowin by the re-
pdblic to such of their citizens as had fuffered in war.
For not only thos~e who were maimed, but the children
axid parents of those who were killed in battle, were
taken under the immediate proteation of the common-
wRealth, and educated and maintained at the public ex-
penice. By these means Sparta and Athens enjoyed an -undif-
putable foperiority, in point of valour and military dii-
cipline, over all the other Rtates. Thebes alone, by an
extraordinary exertion of bravery, attempted to fihare
in their glory. But her power, as we -shall fee ·in the
~feuel, was of very £hort continuance.

Th'e a~rmies both of the Lacedemonians and Athe-

H nians,

-filans; consisted of four classes; citizens, allies, merce.
naries, and slaves. At Athens, in the time of Demne.
trius Phalerius, were reckroned about 20,000 citizens,
I o,000 fkrangers, and 40,000~ slaves,

All the Athenians, at the age of twenty years, were

inrolled, and engaged by onath to serve the republic,
wihich they were obliged to do till they were sixty yealr
old. C~itizens alone were admitted on that footing,
-Each of the tribes wh3ereof the Rtate was composed fur.
nifhed a certain number of foaldiers, according as the pu.
blic exigencies required, either for the s~ea or land service;
for in process of time the naval power of .d~therxs became
~very considerable, in so, much, that at the beginning of
the Peloponnesian war, we shall fee thear maintaininga
f~leet of no fewer than 3oo gallies.

At Sparta, in the time of -Demaratus, were computed'

to be 8000 Spartans. 'There were the flower of the us.
tion, every individual of that number poffeffing the
qualifications of a general; and they were all inhabi·
tants of Sparta; for those who went by the name of
L~acedemonians lived in the courntry. Their allies formed
.the most numerous part of their troops. The mer·
cenaries were maintained by the state; and every Spar.
tan was attended by four or -five Helots:.

Th'e age of those who bore arms among the Lat-ede.

monians, wast from thirty to fixTty years ; thef~ie of a lels
or more advanced age were charged with the defence of
the city. They never put arms into the hands of their
slaves, exrcept in cafes of great necessity. Their pro-
per n~ational forces altogether amounted only to about
.I ,000 mnen; for Sparta was not to populous by a great
deal as Athens.

The infantry of the Greekrs, in general, consisted of

two great divisions: ; at, The heavy armed soldiers,
each of whoax carriedi a large thield, a lance, a javehno,
and .a iiwortd. 2dly, Th-e light- armed ~soldiers, who
bore only holys and flings, anud in the beginning of the
battle were commonly posted in the front of the army.
The armies were divided into different squadrons or

regiments,

r-egimrents, commonly consisting, as at the battle of
1Wantinea, of - between 500 and 600 men; thes~e again
were s~ubdivided, like our modern regiments, into .four
companies of I 28 inen each; and there compamies were
fpurther subdivided into four parties, which we may call
Platoons, consisting of 32 men each, and which admitted
of four men abreast, and eight deep ; or eight abreast
and four dee~p.

The Lacedemonians had but few cavalry ; and the

Athenians itill fewer, their territory being inadequate
to the support of any considerable nu~mber of hors~e.

The Athenians were much superior to the Lacede-

monians in naval power, Their fleets consisted of two
forts of thips: a ft. Their thips of war, called by theux
long }ips, which were rowed : Idly, 'Their tranfperts,
which carried the provifious and baggage, and were
mnanaged with fails. . Of their th~ips of war forne had
but one bench of oars, with~out any deck ; some had
two, some three, some four, and some five benches of
oars. Hence they were denominated biremes, triremezs,
drc. according to their number of benches. The
tritremes were most in use. The most common opinion
is, that. the different b-enches of oars were disposed
above one another obliquely, like the iteps of a stair,
·and not parallel to each other, along the whole
length of the veiffel. The beak or roffrum of the vessel
was on a level with the water, immediately under the
prow, and was a long piece of wood, having a sharp
point covered with iron, with which they s~ometimes
pierced and funk their opponent at a single firoke.
The manag~ement of the ve~fel was committed to
the rowers and sailors,. Diitinat from there were
·the soldiers, whose business was to fight. The sailors
were all citizens, and none of them slaves. The
chief commander of the vessel was called nauclerus. The
nexrt in office was the pilot, who had his flation
at the fiern. It is believed that each of the larger veffePls
contained about 200 men in all, counting both s~oldiers
and sailors. The common pay was about three aboli,

I-H s pearly

nearly three pence Sterling. The pay of the land-for~es
wias much the fame.

The charge of arming the gallies in time of war, and

of furnishing them properly with evrery thing necessary,
was laid- upon the richer fort of citizeris, who* were
thence called trierarchs, a word importing comtmanders of
gallies of th/ree benches of oars. At ~first the nuimber of
'there was not determined; but afterw7ardis each tribe
was obliged to furnish zso men; and the tribes being
then a 0, the whole number of men by that means
amounted to a 200 There were divided into focur classes·
of =oo inen each; of whom the firlt 3b0, being the
rich~est, made the requisite advances; for which recourse
was res~erved to them against the reft. Th~ose E 200 men
were again divided into -parties of I6 men each; of
whfom each party was obliged to equip one galley.

As~ this la~w was extremely arbitrary, and by that

means gave' occasion to much injoffice and opprellion,
Demoifthenes persuaded the Athenians to eitablifh a dif.
fe~rent rule, whereby every citizen whole estate allount·-
ed to· ten talents, wvas obliged to fit out one galleyi upon
his own proper expence ; if his' estate was worth twenty
talents, he was obigedp to fit out two ; and so of the
reft. Those who were not worth ten talents,' were to·
join with others, till the estates of the whole rea~ched to
that fum, and to find one galley among them.

It was the Rtate that furnished the pay of the sailors

and s~oldiers. T~he trierarch had the comlmand of the
vessel; and when there were two trierarchs, they corn.
rnanded by turns, at the rate of fix Mjrronths each. W~hen
their office ended, they were obliged tor give an account
of' their management; and to deliver up the (hip, with
every thing belonging$ to her, into thle hands of the re-
public

THE GteelCS bad a singular taste for every species of

religion. Being for the greater part originally composed
of finall colonies from· different nations, each slate had

lt~s

.Styi,pecuiar form of worthip. They had, besides;
the folly to adopt not only the vrarious deities of one
apother, but likewnife thofie of the different nations with
~whom they had any intercourse.. Still not satisfied withl
thie mTultitude of gods, by there means introduced a-
Inoung them, th~ey inititu~ted a gSeneral· feltival in honour
of vai othear gods where with they were unadquainted ;
and'fcrom the Afts of the Apeffl~es, it appears, that the
Zathltnians had ereae~d an altar to the unkno~wn God.I
The most remarkable particulars relating to religion a-
.mong the Greeks were their temples, their sacrifices,
the~ir fEffivals, their oracles, and their augury.

The four principal temples belonging to the Greeks
wqre, If, That· of Diana at Ephesus, accounted one
of the seven wonders of the world. It was about 440
.feet long, and 230 wide ; and was supported by a 21
·pillars, ab<;it 62 feet high, the whole executed by the
most ikilful artl~ts. 2d, That of Apollo in the.city of
I~Siegs. 3d2, That of Ceres and Proserpine at Eleutis.
4thi~ That o~f Olympian Jove at Atherns. Arll these
:ge~nples were built of marble, and decorated with the
finea ornam ent s. Their .architeature furnitihed tehe most
pae~rfedt models in the three principal orders; namely,
thie Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.
' But of all the temples in Greece, the stroff famous
by folr was that of Apollo at D~elphos, on account of'
the great cre~dit and reverence paid by all nations to
he -rqfpon~es ·of his oracle. This temple was filled with
unmnenfE riches, made up of presents from the most 0-
Palenfi princes and Rtat~es. Thole, particularly, of Croe-
sus kmng of Lydia, were e-xtraordinarily magnificent,
cornfi~tmg of vast quantities of gold and silver, and Tome
itatues of solid gold, of inettimable valule. But the
great wealth of this temple allured the avarice of .several
Prmeces who were not over scrupulous about the crime
of facrilegy. Xerxes, In his return from Greece, took
Poffei~on of the greatest part of its treasures; the Pho-
ceans pinndered it several times; Sylla carried ·off much
of ass I wealth; and the Emperor Nero, long after,

Hg ordered

ordered 500 of its most: valuable statues to be brought
to Rome.

To give a diftinat idea of the fIacrifices of the Greeks,

it shall fuffice to set down an account of' that offered up
on the arrival of Telemachus at Ithaca, as we find it
minutely deferibed in the third book of Homer's O.
dyifey. Nestor performed on that occasion the part of
the priest or sa8crificer : Two men brought forward the
heifer : Two other men approached ·at the fame time 4
the one bearing a bafon with water, the other a bafkret
containing the confecriated barley : Two men more
Rload by ; thle one holding an ax, the other a veffl
to receive the blood. Neffor began the ceremony, by
pouring out the water, by way of libation, and fc~attei-
ing the barley; after that, he cut off from the fore.
head of the victim some hair, which he threw into the
fire, and addressed a prayer to Minerva. T'hen he who
held the ax, cut with one blow the sinews of the neck:
of the heifer, which was then thrown down; the wo-
men prefeat pouring· forth, in the mean time, their
prayers, accompanied with loud exclamations : The
viftim being lifted up again was blooded. As soon as
the was dead, they ikinned and opened her : The
haunches were separated from the reft of th~e carcase,
were overlaid with a double coat of Ifat, covered with
fmnall pieces cut off from the other parts, and then burnt
on the altar, Neffor sprinkling them with wliine. WMhen
the haunches were consumed by the fire, and the in-
trails tasted by all present, the remaining parts were
cut into convenient pieces, and -roasted on spits; and
then those~ present fat down to the entertainment.

The Athenians obfervetd many festivals. The princi-

pal were, .

Ij?, The Panathenea, celebrated in honour of 1Wi-

nerva, the tutelar deity of the city, which~ from her
derived its name. Th~ese were s~ubstituted by Therfeus,
in place of' the Athenea, when he prevailed with all
the people of Attica to remove to Athens. They were
folemnnifed evecry yeari and, on that occasion, vi~tory wcas

publicly

publicly contended for in four different difputes;r na~irieyl
running, w]rreftling, music,. and poetry. Judges w~erd
appoinited soir regulatiixg the fotrtn of the trial, and di-
ifributing the prizes. These disputes were followned byi
a solemn procefiron, inl which a magnificent ftantiard
was carried, exhi~bitingf the feats of iPallas against the
Titans and giants. The old rnen walked foremolt in
this proceilion ; next the oldest women ; after' them came
all the men in the flower of' their agej armed with
theilds -and lances ; they were followed by the youngi
men of the principal families ; girls carrying biafketsi'
wherein were the consecrated things, succeeded nexnt
and the procefiron was closed by young childre~n of both;
sexes. In this ~festival, the people of .Athens implored
the protection of MVinerva.

%dly, The feffivals of Bacchus, confiftingf of the

greater, called D~ionysia, which were celebrated in Spring
within the city ; and the lesser, called Lenea, celebrated
itsthe autumn, and in the country. Both were attendi
ed with magnificent ihows, abd dramatic reprefenta-
tions,' as well of the tragic as comic kiindn The initii
ated dresse~d themselves at these feffivals in fkcins, and
carried in their hands thyrfufes, with drums or horns ;
having their heads adorned with leaves of the vine or
Ivy; and personating Silenus, Pan, or the Satyrsi
They were either aftually drunk,. the mnoft common
·cafe, or else~ counterfeited drunkenness, and ran about
all over the country. The women joined in the cele;
bration of these feff ivals as well as the men ; difgyuifed
thernfelves in the fame manner; and feenx~ed aftuated
by a fort of religious phrenzy. The vilest and most
exceflive debauchery and licentiousness prevailed on
those occallons.

3dly, The festival of ESleutis, or Ceres.-T Lfhis w~as

one of the most famous, and was called, by way of
supereminence, the mnyfieriers. Tlradition bore, that it was
instituted by Ceres; who having corge to Ele~utis in
Attica, taught the inhabitants the use of corn ; and, as
the fame time, softened and huaxaniled their savag~e

;1 4 dif~

difpolitions . There myiteries were divided into the
greater ·and thie ~letter : The leiffer were celebrated in
t-he month of November, and the -greater in the month
of Aug~ust. Strangers were totally excluded frorn both.
Before initiation, it was. neceirary to wash, to pray, to
~sacrifice, and to ·observe afitriat continence for a cer-
tain space. The ceremony· of their admillion was p~er.
formed in the night. On that occasion ·certain myfie-
rious books were read; extraordinary voices, with
ga;pps of thunder, were heard ; fpeAres appeared; ithe
`far~th thook; and the initiated were congealed with
fear. I~t was alleged, that very abominable things
were tranfaated at there ceremonies ; but if so, they
were bu~ried, in silence; for it wc~as highly criminal to
divulge the myfieries of this festival. An Archon,
then honouled with the title of Aing, presided at the
ccelebrat~ion of the ceremonies, having unider him feve.
ral officers to afifit him in the discharge of his duty.
All the Athenians, both men and women, were early
initiated in thee myfrteries.

It was commonly believed, that this ceremony en-

joine~d the pradie of viirtue; and procured the celebra-'
tors the peculial proteidion of the goddes~s, and a higher
dfegree of happiness inr the next life.-W--hat firange
notion~s have been entertained in all ages, about the
manner of ·paying honour to the beings f~uppoferd to
pref~de over· the universe, and of reconciling their fa·
~VOUI ! It was. capital. for any person not initiate~d to en-
ter the temple of Ceres. This festival continued nine
days. The first three days were cons~umed in the per-
formaance of certain previous ceremonies. On the
fourth wras exhibited the proceff~on of the baf~et, To
called from its being composed of women carrying
ba~skets, fi-lled with certain things most carefiilly con-
cealed. T'he fifth . was the procefon of the torches,
when the y imitated Ceres searchin~g for Pros~erpine. On
the fixrth t~he statue of Bacchus, called lacchus, was
carried along. This procellion set off from the Cerami-
cus, a suburb of Athens, and ended at Eleusis. W~hile

ni~arching

~itarching along, they futng hymns in praise of the god-
defs, founded trumpets; danced, and exhibited the
hbigheft marks ofjoy. On the seventh day, games and
combats were celebrated. The two last~ days wmere set
'apart for certain particular ceremonies. This festival
wRas oblerved only once every four years 3 and 'while
it ·cogtinued, it was unlawful to arrest or to throw any
perfop ynto prison.
- Oracles, among the pagans, were 'the refuilt of -the
anxious curriofity about futurity, natural to the minds
of sren, whho, by that means, presu~med to interrogate
the deity about; human affairs.--Trhis was the mast so-
lemns species of prophecy, to which recourse was had for
the, solution of all doubtful ·queffltons,.. To obtain the
opminin oftlh$ gods about declaring war, or concluding
peace, those pagans never failed to apply to fore o-
racle; -and' the response, if -intelligible, which was. fel-
(om ·the~ cafe, was~ religiously complied with. Jup~iter
wass thought to be the chief source of most: oracles.
'(hpfse -

whob w~ere more immediately employed ia -decl6a-

ring the pipafure of the god, wer-e careful to eacprefs
tamfelves ·in ambiguous terms, which might receive
anry ex~planation that the event might juffifyT.-frt thpuld
fieemn that Greece, from it-s earliest times, made d~e of
this method of confutin~g the gods ; for we find no
pre~cise~ period afigned for the firit introdu~5tion of o-
rcaeles into that country. Those who had the chief ma-
nagem~ent of affairs in the different slates,· found these~
oracles very :convenient. For, . when, they had a mind
to introduce any innovation into the sys~tem of, govern-
-ment, or wanted any favourite raafure adopted by their
consltrymen., they knew well how to procure the appro-
bation sos the ora~cle ; and in -that cafe th e people never
vecnt~ured to contradift the pleasure of the gods.--The
priests lik wife :foulnd their advantage in this matter ;
for they took special care not to premit the god to open
his mouth, till after the requisite preparations by sacrifices
and . pref~ents.--O racles, ther~efore, appear to have
becai entirely of human invention, founded on the cre-

diulity

dulity of the multitude, and kept up by the f~elf-intereft
of the priests, and the policy of the rulin~g men.

The most renowned oracle of antiqluity was that of

·Apollo at ~Delphos, a town in the diffridt of Greece
called Phocis. Apollo was there worshipped under the
name of Pythian Apollo; and the priest~ess assumed the
name of Pythia. She delivered her oracles Htanding
on: a tripod called Cortina, which was placed on the
mouth of a hollowT in Mount Parnaffhs, whence a va-
pour that affeated the head was supposed to ifirue.
Round this hollow was built the temple of Delphos.
In process of time, the prieffefs being una~ble alone to
s~ustain the fatigue of giving responses to the multitude
that thronged thither from -all quarters to consult the
oracle, was obliged to make af~e of an afifltant, who
was likewise a female.

It was only on particular days, called happy, that the

prieleffees utter'ed their prophecies. For that purpose
they prepared thems~elves by purifications, fasts, and fa.
crifices. W~hen the -day arrived, the laurel tree that
grew before the gate of the temple, and the earth a.
round, _were perceived to thake. As soon as the priest-
efs was intoxicated by the vapour, her hair flood ere&t,
her look grew wild, the foamed at the mouth, and ap
peared altogether frantic. Virgil, in the sixth book o
his ltEneid, represents his Cuxnean Sybil as adtuated in
the fame' manner. Then the uttered several indift~inat
words, which the priests ·carefully colle~ted, and after-
wards arranged ·according to pleasure. For these re·
fEponfes were almost always dark, obscure, and capable
of different interpretations. Sometimes, indeed, but
extremely f~eldoin, they were plain; for it was hardly
possible for the oracle to mistake the real folutiorn ofa
few among the infinite number of questions asked. It
is to be s~upposed, too, that the miniffers of the god
would employ every fort of art and deceit to impose up·
on the multitude ; and it is' clear, from various passages
in hiffory, that they have accepted of bribes, in order
to return particular responses, Some pious Chr~itians,

indeed, fathers of the church, and others, were of opi-
nion, that the devil took some concers in the matter,
by the permillion of the Supreme Being, that the im-
pious inventions of those Pagans might turn to their
own punishment and confusion.

'Augury was another species of divination to which
the Greeks, as well as the other heathens, had recour~se.
They honoured it too with the title of/cience, though
it consisted of the most ridiculous puerilities. For thos~e
who made augury their fludy, were exceedingly atten-
tive to the notes of birds ; and carefully observed -whe:-
ther they appeared on the right or left hand; they took
special notice of the appetite dis~covered by chickens' for
their food; of the appearance of the intrails of beasts.
of monifers ; of prodigies ; of eclipses ; and of all other
extraordinary phenomena of nature. On such trifling
circumitances did the mos~t important affairs of flarte al-.
most always depend. For it is amazing, that not only
the vulgar, but even many of the greatest men among
the ancients, paid implicit faith to there ridiculous ab~-
f~urdities. At the fame time it must be acknowledged,
that there were several who, so far from giving credit
to this foolish farce of divination, laughed at it, and
made it the butt of their raillery ; such as Hannibal,
Marcellus, Cicero, &~c.

A.RCIENT GREECE.

Containing the .Eg~ry of t~he SECOND AGE of

G~R EEICE.

,From the timne that fliTppias took refucge in Persia~ to theL

end of tbo Peloponnzefian war, a periodt of about on
.y3ears.

the Gr·eek nation, that the fTpace froni -twpenty;
five to forty years of age is in the~ life of manC

samely, the pieriods of its greatest firength and vigour.
It may not improperly, therefore, be called the man-
hood of Greece, being altogether made up of the most
glorious days which that Country ever enjoyed.

The Greeks, hitherto con'fined within the limits of a
narrow country, had found little opportunity of display-
mg, mn the fight of the world, their valour and virtue.
But the Persian invasion that was soon to pour upon
them like an imapetuous torrent, was destined to sec their
merit in the most conspicuous point of view, and to give

ful Ecpeto tigir wifdrom and bravery.~ We dkhal by
g and

and by fee a very fmnall army of Greeks marching bold-
ly against so vast a multitude of criemies, that a single
diifcharge of their darts is said to have darkened the face
of the fkry. We fha~l fee those few Greeks attack with
undaunted resolution that immense cr~oud of Persian
troops, and put them fairly to flight. W~e thill find
them in like manner engaging their enemies at sea un.
der the fame disadvantage in point of numbers, and yet
with the fame success. In a word, we shall have a firi.
king proof of the great superiority of dis~ciplined -valour
ov~er the -blind impetuous courage of an irregular multi.
tude.

During this second age we shall f~ee the Spartans, whio

bIy the admirable constitution of their government and
their private virtues, had acquired a pre-eminence over
all their neighbours, exercising their power with a feve-
rity that favoured of the austerity of their manners, and
treating their allies with haughtines~s anid rigour. In
confequennce of this behaviour, we shall fee thos~e allies
growing by degrees more and more impatient of the
Spartan yoke, and falling gradually under the infinence
of Athens, who induffrioufly availed herself of so fa·
vourable a conjun~ture. The Athenians, therefore, in
their turn take the lead- ine Greece, and maintain their
fuperioirty down to' the Peloponnesian war, const~antly
faithful to their engagements, treating tlhe other Rtates
as equals, and exerting their power only in doing

good. This period, so glorious for Athens, was of about
fifty years continuance. At length, however, the A-
thenians in like manner difguffed the other Rtates b
their ha~ughtiness and insolence ; and by the event o
the Peloponnesian war, the Spartans became a second
time the first~ people of Greece,

# CHAP. I. The two Persian invasions

C HW A P. I.

T~he troo PerJtian invaflos

DARw s I. the son of Hyftaf~pes, of whorn

we have already takeli notice, fille'd at this 52 r,

time the Persian throne, which he is s~aid to have
obtained by the address of his groom. Wie are -told that,
upon the death of 'Smerdis the magian, it was agfeed
among the conspirators who had murdered him, that he
·of their number wJhofe, borfe thould neigh the first: on
a certain appointed day, thould be eleaed king. The
groorm of Darius being informed of this agreement, car..
ried a mare in the evening to the place where the mneet-
ing was to be holden next day, and then brought: his
mafter's hors~e to the mare. Wrhen, therefore, the Per-
fian noblemen came to the place appointed, the horse
of Darius no sooner reached the spot where he had met
the mare the night before, than he immediately neigh-
ed, and Darius was thereupon proclaimed king by the
reft *."

The Persian empire comprehended then not only all
that part of Asia presently known by the name of Per-
fia, but likewise what wre call Turkey in Asia. It also
included on the African.fide, Egypt and fTeveral coun-·
tries on the coast o~f the Mlediterranean sea; and on that
of Europe, part of Thrace and M~acedonia. Indeed it
is true, that several slates in the laft-mnentioned countries
were rather tributary than entirely dependent on the
PEerfian power; and the f~ame may be suppos~ed to have
been the cafe with some others of their more remote
provinces.,

But let us take a brief review of the various caules
that are -said to have produced the war between the
IGreeks and' Persians. W~e have already. obs~erved, that

z. Hip,

* gThbis flory has a very ludicrous ap~pearance, :and will probably
aprthe belief of many readers.

Hlipplas contributed greatly to this event, when, upon
finding all his attempts in Europe to reffore himfelfto
the sovereign power in Athens ineffeatual, he took re-
fuge in Persia; and having insinuated himself into the
favour of the Persian monarch, he pra~tifed every artifice
to prevail with him to attack t'he Aithenians. But this
was~-not all: Other caus~es concurred to forward the en.
deavours of H~ippias.

Atoffa, daughter of Cyrus, and one of the prives of

iDarius, ·had ofed all her influence with her hu~sband to
perfunde him to undertake an expedition into Greece,
that he might thereby give the Persians a consp~icuous
proof of his courage and military prowess. Democe-
des, a -physician, a. man in high efteerm with Atoifa,
was, on account of his being a native of the Greek co-
lony, f~ettled at Crotoxia in Italy, pitched on as the most
proper person for travelling into Greece, to examine
its situation, and the firength of the chief towns along
the conit.- In this journey Democedes was accompa-
nied by fifteen Persian noblemen, who had private in-
ftruations to keep a firift watch on his ·behiaviour, and
to bring· him back again to Persia. After there Persians
had accompanied Demaocedes through the principal ci;
ties of Greece, and made thei requisite observations in
that: country, they` next passed over inlto- Italy, but
were apprehended as spies at Tarentum, and thrown
into prif'on. H~iere Democ~des being' seized with a
firong desire to revilit Crotona his native country,
found means to efeape from his Persian comnpanions,
and retired to that city. The other PeriTans having in
a little time recovered their liberty, returried to Persia,
after endeavouring in vain to prevail with the magi*
ficates of Crotona to deliver up Democedes. H--ence
we fee, that Darius had already begun to meditate an
expedition into Greece; to thE. more immediate ex-
ecution of which he was infitigated~ by the following
tran'ifadio~n.

The lonians, originally a Greek tribe, as -we have

mentioned. above, inhabitedr ca cnfderalble piirt of the

feaJ

sea-coast ofdfia Minor, and had long conduated themi
feslves as tributaries of the Persian empire. Some
weakhy inlha~bitants of Naxus, one of the Cyclades
ilands, having been expelled their native .country, took
reifuget at Miletus, where they implored the ~alliftance of
ArifftagSoras the Persian governor of that city, to reffore
th~em to their native corintry. This f~uggefied to Ac
riitagoraxs the design of reducing the island ofN'Saxus
rinder the Per San power ; which he hoped might
open the way to the conquest of the other Cy-
clades. This plan he commu-nicated to Artaphernes·
governor~ of Sardis, and Darius's bi~other, who, appro-
ved of it, and procured the consent of Darius to attack
Na;i~ms. Having made the ne-ceCfary naval preparations,
Artaphernes gave the chief comman~d of the expedition
to Megabat~es a noble Persian. But the people of' Naxus
made to brave a refifiance, that the Persians, after be-
sieging the island for the space of four months,~ were
cbl~iged to abandon the enterpris~e. 1Megabate~s attri-
biuted ·the bad success of this expedition to the condu~t:
of A~riftagoras, and endeavoured to ruin him in the
opfiin of Artaphernes.

APriftagorras believing his ruin inevitable, resolved, in

order to avoid the resentment of the Satrap, to per-
futade the lenians to revolt from the Persian yoke.
'With this view, after having founded the inclinations of
the leading men among the lonians, and procured their;
edndiutrrence, he made a tour through the whole counl
try,~ to difpore the minds of the multitude to promote-
the projeated revolution. Then, he made himself mar-
fier of the Persian fleet, of which he had the command;
and· travelled into Greece to ende'avour to previail with
ite various- slates to second his undertakring. He began
his; ne~goc~iations at Sparta, where he addressed himf'elf'
toCleom~endis, who was then on the throne, and repre-
seated to him -what a noble occasion now prefemred itself
to the Sp~artans, of employing their valour in procuring
liberty to their countcrymen the lIonians. Cleomenes he-
S~tated· at firit y but· a present from Ari~thgoras of fifty

Ii talents,

talents, induced him ait last to affeige to. his propofalI.
But, according to fame authors,~ the Lacedemo.,
nians not only re'fufed to hearkren to the request of All
riftagoras, but ordered hinx to depart: from their city.
From Sparta Ahriffogaras went to Athens ; where the in-
hiabitants, full of indignation against the Persians, for
havringr lately fcilmmonedi them to reffor-e Hippias to the
regal dignity, were the belt inclined in the world to lif-
fien to his request. They therefore -instantly embraced
Ibis caule, and sent twenty thips to the assist~ance of the
Iomans.

The first attempt of the lonians was against the

504. city of Sardis ; of which, being in a· de~fenceless

situation, ~they quickly g~ot poffeffion. But a fol-

dier having set fire to one of the houfers, the reft, which
were all of' wood, immediately catched the flames, and
th-e whole city was reduced to afhaes. The lonians, a.
larmed in the mean time at the approach of the Persian
army, resolved ·to retreat to. Ephesus, and` to betake
themselves to their fleet ; but the Persians· overtook;
them, and cut: many of them off~
- When Darius was informed of the burning of Sardis,
and that the A~thtenians had affifteid the lonians in ·their
'revolt, he was highly enragCed, swore by a so~lemn oath
to take vengfeance on the Greeks ; and gave orders to
repeat it in his hearing, every day when he fat down to
table, "C Sire, Remiember the Athenians."

TPhe lonians, notwithstanding their late disaster, per-

fiited in~their enterprise; and failing towards the Hel-
lef~pont tookr B~yzantiun.- But~ the Pertiancs, that they
might oppos~e them every ·where, divide'd their forces,
and beat them in several engagem~ents ; in one of which
Ariftagoras was killed. At last, uniting all their troops,
the Persians marched against Miletus the strongest city
of lonia, hoping that if they could reduce it, the other
Ponian cities would soon fubmnit. The lonians, fulfpeA-
ing their design, quickly assembled their own thips and
those of their allies, forming altogether a fleet of 350

al.The Persi·ans, not daring to attack this fleet, en-

de~avouredi

~deavouired by the way of negociation to detach the allies
-from the confederacy, and were f~uccefsful. As foonl
therefore, as the thiips of the~ allies were s~eparated from
'thofe of the lonians, the Persians fell upon 'the: latter,
now reduced to a very fmnall number, and entirely de-
seated. them. Thenr they attacked Miletus, took it,
razed it to the foundation, and put all the inihabitants to
the sword. The other cities, terrified by this example,
immediately made their f~ubmifi~cus. Hiftieus, uncle
of Ariftagoras, and tyrant of Miletus, having gathered
together the remains of the Ionian army, made an in;
curflon into Mysia. But he was attacked by Harpagurs,
who commanded a considerable body -of Persian troops
in that country, was defeated, taken prisoner, and sent
to Artaphernes; who knowing him to have been very
aftive in promoting the tevolt, crucified him, and sent
his head to Darius #.

Darius, ·in -the mean time, was continually meditating

an expedition into' Greece, that he might gratify~ the
violent resentment he had conceived against its inhabii
.tants.~ At last he gave orders to fit out a fl~eet of more?
than 300 thips, and to raise at the fame time a powers
ful land army, thsit so he might crush the GZreeks at
once. Of thefeforces he gave the chief command to
his fon-in-law Mcardonius, whole inexp~erience contria
buted not a little to the bEad succes~s of the expedition.
In thle firit place, he loft many of his ships, together
with a great number of men, in a violent tempest, as

marched to attack the former. But by thbe mif~cond~uc'
of Demna-araus, one of their kings, who had quarrelled
with his brother-king Cleomenes,. the enterprise mif~car.
nied. Cleomenes, in revenge, called. in queff~ion the
legitithacy of D)emaratus's birth ; and the matter having
been referred to the decision of the oracle, the prieitefs
was corrupt~ed, by Cleomenes,. and gave judgment a-
g~ainft Demaratus; who was thereupon d~pofed. En-
raged at this iniurious treatment, he retired to the court
of Persia, where he was received in the most welcome
manner, and loaded with wealth. But all this profu-
sion of kindness could not prevail with him to do any
thing prejudicial to the interests of his country..

The Ahthenians having likewise quarrelled with. the

EginetEe, fitted out a fleet against them; and on that
occasion several engagements ensued; of the circumffan-
ces of which we are ignoraznt. Tlhefe intestine quarrels,
however, gave the Athenians an opportunity of beep-
mning very sk~ilful in naval affairs, and prepared them to
make that vigorous resistance to the Persian power,
which we shall by and by relate.

t Athens-, in the mean time, enjoyed the fwneets of the
LIberty procured her by the expulsion of the Pif~ifrati.
de; and produced many citizens of extraordinary wis-
do~ a~nd valour ; a mong whom . Ililtiades, Aristides,
and T'hemiffocles, chiefly dillting~uilhed themselves.
As there th~ree illuffrious At2thenians are -soon to make
a great figure in the affa8irs of Greece, vie shall here
exhibit in few words the~ chief autlines of their charge;
ters.

IViltiades was a proficient in the art of war, and no

person could boast of equal fksill in condu~ting an ar-
my. He had a particular caus~e of hatred against the
Persians; by whom, on their entering Thrace, he had
been deprive~d of a government he then ~held in that
country .

Aristides and Themniffcl~es, though much younger

than MIVitiades, gave pro~ofs of the greatest abilities.

But·

Bult -t~hetir di~ffer~ent ~difp~oit~ions g~enerally oced~ioned a
contrariety in their opinions. Themiltocles was a ple-
beian jby birth, was na'tura'lliy ambitious, and being at-
tach~e~d ~by prej-udic~e and education to the party of the
p~eople, 'he made it his chief fltud~y to gai-n the goodwill
;of the inuItitude. For that pyurpofe, he behaved on alil
eccafxo~ns withl ewtremne complais~a~nce to th~e citizens,
whom -he Thowe~d himself ever -ready' to obl'ige.; and he
ap~peared very little sc~rupu~lous about the means he em-
-played to -a~ccomplish· his enter'prifes.

Aristides, on the other h~and, being nzoble by birth,

and2 a; ·a-dmirer by pri~ncipl~e of the S~parran constitution,
entertained a firong attachmnent to ariltocracy. H~e was
perfeftly indifferent about popularity, and made juffice
the ~g 4vern ing rule of his whole conduat as well In ·pu-
blic as'l; pr~ivate life. The pubic welfalre was the chlef
chbje61 of -his a~ttention ; and his love for his country,
~his singul-ar skill in public bufinrefs, and his disinterested
and upright behaviour, procured him the admiration,
·the confid~ence, and the effeemn of h~is fellow-citizens.

~While the Athenian Liberty nourished such citizen~s as

·these, and while Sparta, adhering to the rigid inflitu-
;tions of Lycurgus, produced a whole people of the 'bra-
veit fqldiers, Darius resolved to fall upon Greece with
all his forces. But de~sirous previoudly to found the in-
climations of its various itates, veith refpe~t to the f~upe-
riority he intended to claim over th~em, he dilpatched.
heralds through all the cities of Greece, to demand
·earth an~d water; a rym~bol which denoted the fubmif-
·sion and dependence of those from whorn it wats re-
quired on him who required it. TPhe Eiginetee, and a
few other cities, dreading the vast poweir of the Per-
sians, admitted the: superiority claimned. But the Athe-
nians and Spartans, far from ag-reeingr to thie demand of
the heralds, were so provoked at the arrogance of their
commiioin, that through that violent difpolition natu-
ral to thos~e who live under a republican government,
they tranfgreffred the law of nations inl the persons of
the heralds; one of whoml they threw into a well, and

Ig another

another into a deep ditch, telling them, wiith a spirit of
'raillery peculiar to the Greeks, that t~hey might take
from thence as mnuch earth and water as they pleas~ed.

Dlarius, perceiving that he thould meet with the molt:

obstinate re~iftance in his undertaking, made more for-
midable preparations for war than before, and increa~sed
his armame~nt to 500,000 men, and 500 thnips ; the
whole commanded by Datis and Artaphernes. HIippias,
happy in to favourable an opportunity of revenging him-
·self on the Athenians, a~ted as guide And conduaor of
the expedition, under Artaphernes, by· whom he had
been hitherto treated in the kindest and most hofpi-
table manner. The Persians quickly reduced all the
islands in the Ji~gean sea; and having taken Eretria, a
city in Euboea, burnt it to the ground. Then they
entered .Attica, an~d encamped at. Marathon, a fmnall
town on the sea-coast; whence they sent to inform the
Athenians of the chastisement infliated on the obstinate
and disobedient Eretrians.

Upon this the Athenians a plied for alliftance to

the Lacedemonians, who granted them 2000 men.
But a fuperflitious` maxim that prevailed at Sparta,
prevented those forces from begmmnng their march
till after the full moon ; by which means they did
not *arrive at Athens till four days after the: en-
fi~ung battle. The terror of the Persian name refta
ed the other Rtates from furnishing the expeaed-
f iftance. Platea alone s~ent loo 00 oldiers to, join. t e
Athenians. In this extremity the Athenians armed
even their slaves; a mneafure that had never been
praftifed before : but, after all, they cauld rouiter up
no moare than r0,obs men. This small army was com-
manded by ten generals; each of whom ·was to exrercife
the chief command in his turn for no longer spac;e than
a day at a time. But: when it came to be Ariftides's
turn to command, that magnanimous patriot, sensible
of the su~perior skill and experience of Miltiades as a
general, intreated him to accept the command in his

When the public welfare is the sole obje&t in view, great
minds never fail to sacrifice .every meaner motive to
thit liig~heft consideration.

T~hey n ext deliberated whether they ought to wait soir

.the enemy in the city, or to match out and g~ive them
battle:--And indeed how little probabilit~ was there,
that fch a handful of men thould in the open field be
able to fa~tain the shock of the Persian multit~ude ?-
Muil~tiades, however, was of opinion, that they ought to
march out and fight the enemy; and being seconded
by Aristides, the other generals assented likrewife. That
ikilfurl commander desired to take advantage of the im-
prudent situation of the Persians; wvho being hemmed
in by the sea, by a sleep mountain, and by the morals
of IVarathon, could bring but a small ~part of their for-
ces into aftion, and could make no use at all' of their
cavalry.

The Athenians, therefore, to the number of I0,006

men, marched forth against an army of a 00,000 foot,
and. r0,000 borfe. This memorable day reflefct-
ed the highest glory on Miltiades. To prevent his 490.,
hittle army from being surrounded ;by the enemy,
he drew it up with a mountain in the rear; extended his
front as much as possible; placed his chief firength in
the wings; and caused a great number of trees to be
cut down, to keep off the enemies cavalry from caiar-
ging them in flank. The Athenians rushed forwards
on the Persians like so many furious lions. Thsisr
marked to have been the sift: timne that they advanced
to the attack running. By their impetuosity, they 0-
p~ened a lane through the enemy, and fispported with
the greatest firmness the char ge of the Persians. The
battle was at frirt fought by both parties with great va-
loin and obitinacy; but thfe wings of the Athertian
army, where, as we have jult said, Miltiades had placed
his chief firength, attacking the* main body of the ene-
myy in flankr, threw them intoo irretrievable confusion.

abandoned to the viAors their camp full of riches.

TChus the Athenians obtained a viatory more real than

probable. Animated by their success, ·they p~ursued the
.persians to their very Thips ; of which they took seven,
and set fire to several more. On ~this occasion one Cy.
pegirus, an Athenian, after performing prodigies ofra-
10ur in the field, endeavoured to .prevent a particular
galley from putting to sea, and for that pur~pose held her
salt with his right hand; which being cut off, he next
seized her with his left ; which being lik~ewise cut off,
he took hold of her with his teeth, .aird kept her ·So till

The Greeks, in this engagement, loft only 200 men,
.Aristides and Themuiltocles distinguished thems~elves very
highly In the battle; but Miltiade~s gained the chief
glory. As a re~ward for so signal a piece of service to his
country, and to perpetuate the memory of his fksill and
bravery, they caused him to be painted in a large pic-
tudre, reprefecting the battle, in the attitude of giving
orders at the hefad of his I0,000 A4thenians. They like-
wife raised monuments to the memory of those who had
fallen in the engagement, and thereon inferibed the
names both of the deceased, and of their particular tribe.

Their success at MVarathon, as having made the

Greeks sensible of their own firength, is accounted the
principal cause of their future viaories ; and indeed the
consideration of having with a handful of men defeated
so vaf't an army, might> juffly inspire them with great
confidence. But what may not a fksilful general per-
f~ormn at the head of a small number of discipli~ned soldiers,
saauated by the most ardent love for their country, and
ready in its defence to confront death in every thape ?

The Persian fleet, in the rnean time, attempted to

liderate m3ultitude immaedia~tel~y conde~mned him ·to death.
E~very mana of ~sense wais ashamed and thocked at lthe
injaithice and cruelty of this fTeatence. In vain d~id
his friends constantly remnind the people of his beha-
viour t-·M~arathon. All they were able to obtain, was
a ozmlarnt~atation of the s`entence fr~tom d~eath to ?a fine
oaf Mikty. talents. His great exploits had already excll-
ted the ·jealotify of his fe-iowr-citizens, who eit-her thought
that they owed him too mnuch, ·or were afraid left he
might apire~ at frovereign authority; and careless of be-
ng called ungrateful, they accounted his late misfor-
tune. a cPrime. 1Viltiades being unable to pay s~o high a
fine, was thrown into prison; where his grief and in-
dignation at such unworthy treaturent rendered .his
wound incurable, and soon brought him to the grave.
Thus did that great man afford a striking example of the
iagrat-itude and cruelty of his inconftanlt and capricious
coulntryTmen.

His son Cimon, who after wards made so great a si-

gure, having ibeen enabled, with the afiftaance of his
friends, to- dikcharge the fine, 0btained the privilege of bu -
Plying the dead body of his unfortunate father ; whole
491keh pened the eye~s of the .Athenians, and made them

sensible

se~nsible of `the itsjuftice-of their behaviour. But their
sorrow was tool late,- and could not ·redeemn that excel.
lent commander from the grave, nor even prevent
their repeating the fame cruelty and folly on future
occafxons.

T lhe. wife Aristides very soon bcame a s~econd viftinp

to their capricious ungrateful disposition ; but his dif.
grace was honourable, being confifledly crccafioned by
his Rteady adherence ·to juffice.- We have already men.
tioned, than an extreme contrariety of. manners and'
principles' subsisted between him and Themiltocles. The
latter, though of mean extra~tion, was extravagantly
ambitious, very: bold and enterprising, and of so ac-
tive a disposition, that quiet and repos~e seemed a bur.
den to him. H~e affef~ted to roam through the fireets
in the night; and when afkred the reason, answered,
That he could not sleep for thinkring on the trophies of
TViltiades. H~e was exceedingly artful in findi~ng out
and availiing himfnrelf eff the ruling pafirons of men ; and
was fb mluch the more dangerous by being very elo·
quent. :Aristides, on the contrary, was of a refervedl,
mod eft, Ready disposition ; governed all his a~tiozlr by
the most kcrupulous rules of juffice ; and regarded the·
loft~y p-roje £1s of Themiffocles as to many Rteps to ~ore-
reign power. Themistocles, impatient of being conti-
nually thwarted in his -ambitious s~chemes by so rigaid a
censor as Aristides, resolved to free ~his, hands of him at
once. For that purpose he applied himself privately to
form a party against Aristides; and at last got him ba·
nifhed by the sentence of offracifax. It: is ~a~id, that on
this occasion a peasant who did not know Aristides, and
could not write, having by accident applied to him to
write his owon name on his thell, was asked by Aristides,
Ti~hlether he had ever received any provocation from
the person he wanted to banilh ? " None at all, Sir,"
answ~ered the peasant, "C but I cannot bear to hear him
C. always called the ju/2." Aristides without s~aying a
word took the shell, wrote his own name upon it, and
returned it to the man. T7Vhen going out of the citr

ctia: bgged of the gods, that no misfortune might hap.
pea ;to' his ·countrymen which might oblige them to re-
_calhi~m from banishment.

'i'hemqiffocles, in the mean time, foreseeing ~an ap-

proaching florm from the quarter of Periia, persuaded
the ·Athenians to employ ·all the money they drew from
~thei ,mines in fitting out a powerful fleet for the protec-
tion of their country.

.Darius, -more axafperated than eve~r agathft: the G~reeks
by 'the defeat of his army at Marathon, resolved to
ex8ert his utrnoft efforts to wipe away that disgrace, and
to reflore the glory of h-is arms. He gave orders there-
, fbre. to make new levies of .troops through all his pro-
vinces; and consumed no less than three years in pre.
paring for this third expedition againit Greece, which,
though. then pretty far advanced in years, he intended
is con~du~t in person. ~But death disappointed all his
projeats.-LDarius was of a mild, humane difpolition, and
alt~riat observer of juffice and the laws of his kingdom.
But the keenness of his paffons hurried him sometimes
into sneatures of which his calmer reafobn would have
dlifapproved. He reigned thirty-fix years, and is known
in ~feripture by the name of Ahcafuerucs.

A'fter the death of Darius, h~is son Xerxes, the eldest~

of hiss children by Atoffa1 his second wife, s~ucceeded him
in the kingdom of Persia, and prosecuted the warlike
preparatioons begun by his father. Having subdued the
Egyptians, he determined in the third year of his reign
to carry his arms immediately into Greece.

Xerxes therefore affembing his council, in-

fbrmed them that he was resolved to undertake 484*
this expedition in order to punish -the Athenians
for having been accessory to the burning of Sardis, to
w~rpe~ away the~ disgrace of the defeat at Marathon, and
to execute the other intentions of Darius his father.
IV~ardonius, of whom we have made mention above,
·behaved on-this occasion with all the baseness of a ser.
vile flatterer, to please the vanity of his matler. He
Witired him, that no nation in the world would dare

to oppose~ his power ; and 12e affe~ted to vilify land to
d~erpife exremely the courage of the Greeks. Thfe iei
of the council, perc~eiving the kring to be mightly pleased
whth th2e ,fatt~ery of IMard~onius, did not fail, Hkie well-
bred courtiers, to appiland his opinion, and to coincik
w'rlth hxlm in every particular. Sio true it is, that princes
sowe almost always ·th~eir greateR misforttunes -to the
complaifairce gnd adulation of tho~e about them. A4flrta·
L b~anus1 alone, ithe un~cle -of Xerx-es, ventured to contra.
diett -the opinion given.' He endeavoured to m~ajke tle
king ·fenfxble of the raf hnefs of the i~ntenied -enterpri~se,
by putting him in mind of the unfortunaste fauccefs of
another enterprise of the fame kinid altte~p~ted by his
father Da~rius against the Scythians, ·a~nd the~ imminent
danger into which it had brou~ght that prince~, who had.
been atterlyp undlo~ne, if Hifteius had, agreeably to the
advice of the other officers and courtiers, destroyed a
'bridge, he had· thrown over the Danu~be. HIe likewise
rerminaded Xerxes of the shameful defeat of the .Persians
at 1Warat-hon ; and exrhorted himt not to give car to the
flattering, suggestions of inexperien~ced cou-rti-ers, nor to
fuffer his reafoni to be dazzled wi~th the glaring profped
of imaginary· gloryi HPe concluded with upbraiding
IVl-ardonius for the insincerity of his adlvic~e.

Princes corrupted by flattery are apt to construe a

open' generous behaviour into a feditiours bokin-erl. Thus
Xerxes, instead of profiting b~y the advice of his uncle,
was enraged at it ; and told Artabanus, that his being
brother to Darius was the only c~onsidera~tion which rpro-
te~ted him from the effe~is of his refentmnent. BuJt on
cool refle~tion, Xerxes perceived the injustice of this
treatment of his uncle ; and next day ackn~sowledged in
open council that he had been in the wrong.

Herodotus relates a ridiculous story of an apparition,by

which he pretends that Xerxes was confirmed in his refol
lution of invading Greece, and Artrabanus deterred from
giving further opposition to that proje~t. It is generally
believed, that if there was indeed any foundation' for this
itory of the appariti-on, which is extriemly improbable, it

t~akie only the remaining four along with him in the ex--

to· put to death in~prefence of his father *.

Xerxes passed the winter at Sardis. From this place

he sent deputies to demand earth and water of all the~
cities of Greece, except Akthens and Sparta, whomhe
affeated thus tacitly to single out for vengeance, In the
spring h~e advanced towards the Hellespont; where he
enjoyed the pleasure of feeing the sea covered with his
fleet, and~the land with his army. Artabanus took this
oppo~rtunity to makce some refiedions, in the prefenceof
the king, on the many miseries incident to mankind;
which it is the first duty of sovereigns to alleviate as' much
·as possible.. He insisted, at the fame time, on the great
uncertainty of h~uman affairs ; and could not help ap.
plying his observation to the pref~eat enterprise of
Xerxes, wvhofe army was so numerous, that no country
could for any conGderable time furnish it with s~ub.
fiftence, and whole fleet was· too large for a~ny harboat
to contain.

To transport his troops from Asia into Europe, Xerxc

ordered a bridge to be thrown over a itrait of the Hells
~Fpont, a~bout a quarter of a league broad, known at
present by the name of Gallipoli. But the work weu
deffroyed by a florm. Xerxes, enraged at this acci.
dent, vented his resentment upon the' sea. Herodor
tus says, he ord'ered. it to be chaftif~edwith 3B0 lathe

Onie of these bridges consisted of 36-0, and the other of

-were Se~cured by large anchors against the violence of
ihe istinds and waves; and were joined together by fix
lage cables,' reaching from one fide of the fkrait to the
Aiir, and fastened on both sides to large w~ooden
f~lakes fixed in the ground. The thips were covered'

th a' fort ·of- deck, and the army was seven days in

.desired. to review it 9 and, for that purpose, ordered it
tobe drawn up in the plains in the neighbourhood.

into Achaia. In the mean time, the fleet of Xerzes
coaffed along the shore, ikegulating its motions by those

amounted altogether to no more than r I,oo-o; and of
there only 4000 were more~ immediately destined to de.
·fend the passage. But every man of that number w~as
f~ully determined to conquer or to die. Xerxes was far
from thinking that the Greeks would dare to dispute his
passage. But finding himself mistaken, and being in.
f~ormed by Demaaratus, that a handful of men might at
this place flop for a considerabl~e time' all his forces, -he
end~ea~voured to -corrupt Leonidas by magnificent pre-

having reje~ted all his temnptations with disdain, Xerzes
thereupon commanded hire, by a me-Ssenger, ao fend
him his arms ; "L Let your king come and take them,"
answered L~eonidas. Then the INiedes advanced ag~ainst

were obliged to retreat. The troop of Persians, diftin*
guifh-ed by. the name of immortal, nexzt charged the
Greeks, and fought with great valour, to that the pals

conf~iderbbl~e on the fide oif t~he Per~fianbs. ~fr~om the
event. of ·thefer several sations, the Acth-niatns learrned,
that vic~tory is- not always determi~ned by the greater
number of thips. Hearing, in the -mean time, of what
had passed at Thermnopylae, the Greeks thought it ad-
vifable to r~eti~re nearer home, and therefore set fail for
Salamis, a Ifmal'l island nRot far ~fron ~Attic~a.-T-he very

by Gelon, tyrant of Syracure.

Xerxes having now adv~anced. into Phocis, after

mnarking his march all along with the effeas of his re-

fe at ment,

feamentpithe Pe-lopennetians· refoled to fortify t~hem-
selves -within the Isthmus. The ALthema~ns, therefore,
feeiing·:themfelves on the eve of being cruthed under
the whole weight of the Persian power,, feat, an this
exEtremity, to consult the.ora~cle; who told them.,. "C That
cothe only means of ~prgSrrving their citly roere wtoodena

walls."~ There wooden walls poin~ted out by the

oracle, ~were interpreted by Themiltocles to be their
ships -; and he told his coun-trymen, that the sole mnea~s
of pres~ervation left was, to abandon the city, and to
bet-ake thernfelv~es to their fleet. This advice was not
at all relikihed by the people, who thuddered. at th~e
thoughts of deserting their gods, and the comlbs of ·their
anceffers. Themiltocles, ;however, succeeded at last,
in pte~dnaing them, that the existence of Athens de-
pended le~ither on its honfes nor its temples, but on
the lives of its citizens ; and that the god themselv~es
had, By: the mouth of the oracle, plainly declared it to
be. their pleafCure, that the Athenians. ought to leave
their city for a while. The people, at last, convinced
by his eloquence, coentaed to go on board of their
thips.

* Itis dificult to fay, whether we are more affeited on
this oecation by the melancholy situation of: the AtheL
nians, thhus compelled by a barbarous prince to desert
their native .countlry ; or by the heroic resolution of
thof -Athenians to go in this manner into a fort of vo-
Iuntary banifhmnent, rather than to submit to their op-
pressor.

- TbttheAhniarns conveyed their women, children, and
the greater part of their old men, to Trezene, a finall
town on the sea-coast of Pelopounefe, wrhere they were
received with all the marks of humanity that their fitua-
tion r-equired. But many of their oldest men were
left in the citadel, being unable, by reason of their
great age and infirmities, to undergo the fatigue of
transportatio~n.

XIerxes in the mean time approaching towards Athens,

feat a detachment of his troops to plunder the temple of

K 3 Delphos,

jDelphos, which contained' immense riches. B ut Hero
dotus and D~iodorus Siculus both tell us, that -moft.of
the soldiers sent on this errand: ·perifhedd by the way in
a violent tempest.

The Persian army arriving at Athesns, find nothing

but silence and solitude within the walls. They attack
the citadel, which~, after a brave refifitance by its feeble
garr ifon, was -taken by storm, and 8dl within it. were
put to the sword. Xerxes ordered the reft of the city
to be set: on fire.

In -the mean time differences were like to arise in the

Grecian fleet commanded by Eurybiades, onci half of
them being of opinion that they ought to .advrarce to.
wards the isthmus of Corinth, to be -at hand to support
their army ; and the other, that they ought by no means
to quit the advantageous post: at Salamis. The latter
opinion was supported by Themiltocles, who on this
occasion gave another proof of ·his extraordinary mode-
ration and coolness of temper. For while he was main·
taining his opinion with some warmth against Eurybiades,
who was a man of a very cholerick difpolition, the latter
flew in a pafiron, and lif~ted up his cane to- firike him.
TIhemiffocles called out to him, rC Strike, but hear me."
Hig eloquence and firmne~ss at last prevailed, and the
Greeks faLw that, being extreinely inferior to the enemy
in the number, as well as in the size of their thips, it
was of the highest importance to avail themfielves of their
prefeat situation, and to give- battle in foch a narrow
firair as that of Salamis, where the enemy could riotbring
all,their fteet into a~tion. They resolved, therefore, to
prepare to fight the Persians in this firait.

The Persians too determined to give battle, con-

trary to the opinion of Qu~een A4rtemif~a, who represent-
ed to them, that the loss of a sea fight must be inevi-
rtably attended with the deftwa~ion of their army at land.
BLut her advice, though the motLt prudent, was rejed-·
ed, Xerxes himfielf havinlg declared his .sentiments for
their coming to a £ion. Themiffocles, in the mean
timec, to put: it entirely out of tlw power of his counr

trymen

tr~yisen to retire from Salamriis,~ contrived to have false
intelligence· conveyed ~to fXerxes, of their intending to
decline the engagement, and to make their escape,
and therefore advising him to order his fleet instantly
to advance and block them up. This firatagem he
communicated to Aristides, wRho undertook to exhort
the reft of the commanding officers with whom he was
in great credit, not to be difrnayed at feei-ng themsel~ves
he~mtned in, but to behave with their ufinal intrepidity.
The firatagem had the ddired effeft; and the Greekns
feeing -no other possibility of eleaping, exrcept by fight-
.ing their way through the midit of the enemy, prepared
for- the engagement.

.Xerxes, who was on thore, being .desirous of feeing
the battle, ordered a superb throne to be created for
him' on an eminence. -Th'e fle~t of the Greeks con-
sifted of 3 80 f~ail.--Themiltocles, who that day com-
moanded it, waited for the rising of a wind, which re.
gularly began to blow at a certain hour, in a dire £kion
exa~tly in the face of the enemy. The Persians began
the attack with great bravery; but the small fleet of the
Greeks a~ting. by the fkrill of its commanders under
.every advantage, fdon -threw the enemy's first line into
conrfution, and funk the Pertian admiral. Those that
followed him, intimidated by his fate, partly betook
themfrelves to flight, and partly were ftmk, On the
·wings, howvever, the a~tion continued very warm and
obti~nate; but the wind being ag~ainit the Persians, the
iunwieldy size of their thips rendering them very diff-
cult to be managed, and their, great number rathler
RmbarrafiTng than availing them in such a carrow fir~ait,
they could not long sustain the impetuosity of the Athe-
aians, but fell· Into a general disorder. T~he lonians,
mmndful of their Grecian exctraftion, were the firfit that
fled; and they were quickly followed by the re(L of the'
Persian fleet, which soon appeared scattered up and
down in flight and confuflon.

Queen Artemil~a signalised herself by a courage far

above her sex. In the height of the battle, perceiving

K 4 herself

herself to be on the point of failli-ng~ into the hands of the
G~reeks, the imrmediately hung out Grecian col-ours,. and;
attacking - one ·of the· Persian gatlleys, funk: it. The
Greekr that purs~ued her, deceived byT the fbreatgemJ, be,
lieved her to be one of his ow~rn party, and qui~tted the~
pursuit. The vCi~to~ry coff the Gr~ee~ks 40o th~ips; but of
the Persian-s 200 were eth~er takie~n or fonk.

This engag-emne~nt, on~e of the moA memorable recordedl

in ancient hifforyT, acq~uired immonrtal famr~e to th~e Gre-.
cian wisdom and courage.-T-lhe renowned Cimon,
though -yet but a· young man, diftinguiihed. himself
highly on. that oecation, and gave evident £2gns of his
future greatness. But as the prin-cipa~l gl;o~ry of the
vi~t~ory belonged to Thenriffo~cles, the eyes of all the
Greeks were fixed~ on him as their deliverer; and the
higheit honours were'conferred on him. At this timne
every featiment of jealfodry was oveirlooked, and none
ex~ceeded the Lac~edersonians in their encomuiums on
Themiltocles, whom they crowned winith laurel, the~ re-
ward of wifdo~bm and valour. W Then he appeared at the
Ol~ympic gares, th~e whole af~femrblyT role up to give him
place; every eye -was fixed on himtn alone ; and that day
wvas the rizoft glorious of his life.

This impor~tant def~eat sitonkifhed an~d disconc-erted

~Xerxes in the. highest degree. Mardonius, however;
endeavoured ·to omlpof~e his mind' by palliating his
loss ; b~ut at th'e fa~me timle a-dvised hi~m to set out
for Persia; afiruring him~, that with 300,000 of his land+
forces, he, M~ardonius, did not doubt of being abl-e to
conquer the Grreeks, notwithfianlding the late disaster.
-T-he remains of the Paerfian fleet took refuge in Cumes,
a harbour in Eoia.

. On the ot her hand, Th~emiltocles, in con~cert- with A·
rLIlides, sent private intelligence to Xerxes, that the
G~reeks were preparing to destroy his bridge over the
·I~elifpont. That weakr, credulous Prince believed the
information, and leaving Greece in a violent hurry,
with a ithong guard of his best: tro'ops, arrived, affter a
very pain ful· arch of 45 days, (attended with the double

tification to find it already dernolifhed by a great fiona.
Th~is m~ighty: Prince, therefore, whose numerou~s iteet

seamed to; bind the waves, was reduced to the neceirty·

all the GreeE tem~ples of Atfia to be burnt, and the im-
nienfe riches contained in then to be applied to defray
the expences of his czped~ition-.

M~ardonius, after wi~nteying. in Thessaly, took the

Sield, andi began his operations, by making very advanm-
t-ageou~s ffiers to the Athenians, to detach them from
their confederacy with the other it;ates, prornifing not
~only to ryebu~ild their city, and to give the~m a: vaff f~um
of money-, but~ to fee th~em at the head of all Greece.
Aristides, then Archon, aafwerei~d .the neffen~gers of
14ttdllniurs, that ·all: he .gold in the world was infuffi-
cInt ·to corrUpt~ the Athenians, or to induce tehemn to
dlefieit t~he d~efenc of the common liberty of their coun-
tryi; that ~while the fu~n. continued: to ligtht the world, the
At~hemidans would remtai~n; the mortal enem~ies of the Per-
$a~nj and would revenge, to the utm~noft of their power,
xtheeife~idhief they had ·brought, upon thei~r country,. and
the -bu·rning as~- thfeir hodes -and temples. As soon as
Yilardonius received the answer of· the Athenians,. and
thenc'e Saw that. no anotiv-e could induce th~emn to breeak
theiir:ingageterit~s, he ordered' his. army to advance to-
wards A9tticae. The A~thenians, on the approach of the
P~ersian armyi left their city a recond. time, and retired to
Salamis. LMardonicus, thelreuEp~on, f~ewr new deputies to
themi, with terms (t-ill more advantageous than the
fenner. But the Athenians were to far fromx accepting:
them, that they fb~oned to death one Lycidas, only for
haymg, that· they ought to give an: audience to the de-
Pllttes. The Peri~an ~general, provo~kPed at the contempt

wt~t

with whtich the Athenians treated all his proposals, en.
tered Athens, an~d burnt -every thing that had formerly
'efeaped the fury of XEerxes.

In this frtuation, the Athenians complained to the

Lacedemnonians of their not having sent: them the itipu-
lated succours. The latter were then' solely intent on
maintaining their ground within the Peloponnese, and
de~fending the entry ·of the ilthmnus ; but, in compliance
wpith th~e requisition of the Athenians, -who made a
great outcry against the flowners of their proceedings,
they sant· to theitr affiia~ance Sooo Spartans, each of

camped on the plain:haviing been attacked by the Persian
cavalry, were, after a very brave and long· resistance, on
the point of giving wayi when 300 Athenians ran to their
relief. Th3e battle then became mo~re obiitinate than be-
fore.- But Mlragiftius, who :conman~ded the I'erfian ca·
valry, being slain, his nen·bet~ook ·themsel~ves to flight.
The death of this officer, who was reckoned the ablest in
the Persian army, spread· universal1 coniternation through
all their troops. e days intervened between this ac·
tion and the general engagement. Artabasus was of
opinion, that the Persians ought to avoid a general battle;
but M~ardonius,l a man of a violent· fiery dispositions
thought opther~wife.-Paudlanias and Aristides, infouoed

Mi~the de~igth of the Persians to' attack them, dred up
thei~r- "armry in battle order ·near to the city of Platea;
which Mardonius perceiving, changed' the intended or-
art of his att~ask. That' day was wholly taken up with
there evolutions. . But the Greeks, finding thems~elves
fttaitiened for water in rthir pres~ent situation, resolved to
d~camrp. MsI~rdonius believing this movement to ~be a
flight, imnmediately advanced with his men, uttering
loa'd thouts, and chiarged the rea~r of hfe Greek army,
composed of the Laced-emonians ; who fo~rming the~m-
felvres in a colu~mn, opposed the enemy with their usu~al
valour, and fallin~g on the Persians with the greatest~
fiiry, mnade a dreadful slaughter.

SMarrdonius fell in the beginning of the a~tion. The
utilain body of the Greeks army advancing in -the mean
rsittre to the charge, in feiparate detachmaents, completed
thie· ove-rthrow of the Pertians. In another quarter of the
field,· the 4 o,ooo Greeks in the Persian fiervice, who
wre~ enga~ged with the t~roops commanded by Aristides,
hearing of~ the fl;ight of the Barbarians, followed their
examp~r~le, and retreated- )lkewrife; but rallied in their
camnp, and there intrenched thernfelves. ~ The Lacede-
anlonansj however, s~upported by the Athenians, attacked
anrd ·faitced their intrenchments; after which nothing
iwas to;t be seen but a general massacre : for the Persians
bei~ing too numerous to be made prisoners, received no
qifiarrter, and were all pult to the tword. Artabazus, after
dft~inguifhing himsel~f both as a fkrilful officer aind as a
brave soldier, colle~ted the scattered rema~ins of the Per-.
fiant army, amounting now to no- more than 44,ooo
men,- and returned with all expedition towards Persia.

cau~se of the corrup~tion of the Grecian manners.

By the persuasion of Aristid~es, the Greeks passed a

solemn decree, obiging all the slates to fend deputies to

-taking umbrage at this, from an apprehrenflon left A5~
thens thould become too powerful, repre'ifented to the
Athenians, that it was -the general interest of~reece to
have'no fortified place without the Pelopounefe, becadfe,

demon, there, to julfify the conduat of his counrtrymen,
maintained in open senate, that it was as much for the
common advantage of the allies as for that of the Aethe·
-nans, that the latter had fortified their city with good
walls; that besid~es, it was but equitable that they, as
well as the reft, thould take proper measures for -their
own safety ; and, in fine, that they were able to defend
themfeclves 'either against foreign orr domneltic enemies.

In the next place, Themi~cltooes solely intent on in;

creating the power -of the--republic, fortified Pyreuts, she
famous harbour of Athens, in the fame manner as he
had done the city ; and persuaded the Athenianas to aug.
ment their fleet yearly with twenty thips. The o~bje6-~
of this fkrilful politicia~n, was to deprive the Luacedetoi
ia~ns of the superiority hithe~rto poffef~fed- by them over
th'e other Rates of Greece. But it must be- confef~fed,
that -he was. not 'very femupulous with regard to the
means employed by him for that purpole. An instance
of this -was his projelR of tsurning the Gr ecia-n fleet in
the harbour of Pegazus, whither it had retired to winter
after the defeat of Mardonius; or, according to some
authors, that part of it only which belonged to the La-
cedemonians. But not daring openly to propose this
scheme, he was desired by the people to communicate
the mai~tter privat'ely to ArIftideis; who having been at-
cordingll informed of it,. declared to the people, that
though the projeat of Themiltocles was indeed highly
ofeful, yet, at the fame time, it was most unjust
-Themiltocles was therefore prohibited from putting itin
exe~cution.- HowI becoming, thus to fee a whole Rane~
prefer what was just to what was dfefu~l! and what i

B ' hgih

high idea of the juftice' of Aristides mult we not con-
ceive, when we fee him ch~osen singly by a whole peo*
plec, to determine whether a projeft of the utmost ge-
~neral importance was juff or unjuff !

The Lacedemonians, about this time, propefed that

the deputies who had formerly been admitted to fe~ats in:
the council of the amphy~tions, from Thessaly, -from
Tlhebes, from Arg~os, and from the othe-r Rates that had
submitted to Xerxes, tho~uld, as a pmrilfhment for their
.defeltion fro~m the common cadfe, be for the future deta
prived of that privilege.. The proposal appeared to be
equitable, a~nd coincided with the resentment entertain-
ed of the pufilanimous and treacherous conduft of those
slates. But Themiffocles, `apprehensive ·left by the pro-
posed excidi~on the Lacedemonian intereit migh~t pre-
ponderate too ·much in that imrportant council, emiployv-
ed all his cloqueh-ce and address to get the proposal re-
jeaed : and his endeavours were fuccefsful. TIhis fiep·
exasperated the Lacedemonians extremely against The.
millocles, whom they ever after opposed in all his
'Ichemes. In particular they exerted their influence to
support the rising fortuines of Cimon in opposition to
Themiltocles; and by their intrigues they were very
infirumental in promoting the f~ubifequent persecution.
and banishment infliated on him by his ungrateful
conn try men.

·AriCgides having nbthing in view but the welfare of
his country, was continually employed in promoting
her; interests. His prudence prevented diflurbances
that were l~ikely~to arise in At~hens by the licentious and
turbuleint difpolition of the people, who finding them-
selves :now in peace and security, desired to takre the
whole power o fgovernment into their own hands. To
these sed~itious projetts they were chiefly. instigated by
Tihemiffocles, partly .from motives of opposition to his
rival-;iriftides, who supported the party of the better
fort ; but principally from partiality to the party of the
-commons, to which his birth naturally attached him.
drifitides, to. quiet them, procured the o~ffice of Archon,

for that purjpofe, sent out a fleet ~under the :comt1·ma~d of
Pa~usanias., ;Ari~it~ides, and ·Cimon the son o~f Mkilt~iades.*
~This e~xpe-dtion was attended with the desired success,
anid th~e Persian gar~risons ~were expelle~d frotri all the cii
ties. Then the fleet failed up the Helllefpont, and at-
tacked By~zantiumn; which ·Pausanias had the glotry of
taking. But the haught~y -diFpeftion natural to that
SpartanM, appeared to be igreatly increased by his late
success. ;He treated :the offilce~rs in the m~ost: arrogant
and .overbe~aritng .ma~nne~r, and soon- became ·perfealtIy
unsupportable. This excellive pride Rained the gloryr
of his a~ianns, and at last brought on his ruin. For
defin~ing to Iber~cme the fo~n-in-la~w of Xerxes, his vanity
indulced htim to bletra-y his country, and he orffleredd to
snake ?that monarch anafter of Sparta, and of all the reft
of Greece, on condition of r~eceiv~ing his daughrter a
anarriage, and of ibeing invefied with ~o~rereign autho*

forward he daily gave diftinguifbring exarks of the finest
parts. ;·and soon ihowed ·himself capable of rivalling his
pfather in valour and military skill; Themiltocles in a-
cuteness and prudence; and Aristides· in integrity and
jofice. The latter conceived the highest regard for Ci-
man whlile yet very young ; and perceived that he was
equal to the molt important offices of the slate. In the
iwo memorable engagements at Salamis ard Platea, Ci-
anondfignalized hims~elf ~`remarkably, and quickly attrac.-

and reduced se~veral of the enemy's cities. ---He next

Cruising along thelcoafts of A~sia, he reduced all the
maritime cities ofP Caria and Lycia, and left not the
Persians in poffeffion· of* a single inch of ground be.
tween lonia and lPamphylia. Hearing that the Per-
fian fleet lay at anchor at the mnouth of the river Eury.
Inedon, waiting for a reinforc'rement of Phenician thips,
that they might attack hirn with their united forces; he
immediately failed against the former to prevent their
gun~lion; charged theml with such vigour, that they
were obliged, in s~pite of their greait superiority in num.
ber, to run their thips aground; and took more than
I oo of them. WNithout giving his men time to· breathe:
after their viffory, he initantly landed them, and at-
tacked the army of the enemy, whichi was drawn up on
the banks' of thie Eurymed~on. Tfhe Persians sustained
the first charge of the Greeks with great firmness. But
the troops of Cimnon, animated by their late faucef~s,
broke them at taft, put them fairly to flight, made a
great number of them prisoners, and got a vast booty.
Cimon crowned his vittories with the capture of the
Phenician fleet which was coming to the afirftance of the
Persians, and by that means gave a fatal blow to the
Persian naval power.

the defe;5t of eviden~ce, or the gratitude of his country-
men for his past important services. He returned,
therefore, to Byz~antium;· but immediately renewed
his negaciations with Artabazus, to whom X~erxes had
referred him, that they might together f~ettle the plan of
operations. The whole matter, however, was at lat
clearly brought to light. A slave, whom he had char·
ged with certain dispatches for Asia, having obferred,
that of all his companions formerly dispatched th-ither on
business of the fame krind, none had~ retirned, became
apprehensive of meeting; with the fame fate himself, Ile

·iiias thiereifore tempted to open the letter of his master 5

, ~here, perceiving at once all the importance of his com-

rililion, he resolv~ed to deliver· his difpatchets to the E-
ph-ori, wrho, after maturely weighing every circum-
itance, ordered the slave to take refuge in the temple of
Neptune; and then propagated a report, that the real
foan of his ~doing so, was to beg pardon of the ~god for
habiving opened a letter of his master. Pauranias ha-
ft-ens to the temple; where the Ephori being concealed,
ovrerhear his whole conversation with the flave,are there-
by entirely convinced of the full extent of his treason,
anld reiblve to bring him to immediate punishment.
Pad~anias, perceiving his danger, flies for safety to the
temple of M~inerva. T'he Ephori, not chufing to vio-
late the privilege of the temple, but defrring, at the
farme time, to puniih the traitor, ordered the entry to
be thalt up, and part of the roof to be uncovered, that
he might be starved to death; which happened ac-
cordinigly.

The ardent gpaffion ofThemiffocles for power,

at length offended the Athenians; who, provo- 471.
~ked at his constantly reminding them of his Eer- *
vices, banished him from Athens. Th"emriltocles was
obliged to take refuge at Argos. In the mean time, it
was alledged, that some passages in letters, found in
the poffeiltion of Pausanias after his death, seemed to in-
~dicate a secret understanding between him and Themi-
flocles. But the truth of this faBt was never properly
ascertained. The ~Lacedemonians, however, upon whose
ambition he had been a constant check, took advantage
of this circumstance to ruin him, and communicated
the pretended discovery to the Athenians. Themliffocles
en~deavoured to justify himfielf by letter. But his ene-
xies, glad of so fair an opportunity of accomplishing
his deftrurtion, used every argument .to convince his
countrymen 'of his guilt, and were at last fuccefsful.
TIhemiflocies, getting notice of these proceedings, re-
tired to the island of Corcyra,, and from thence Into E-
·pire. But thinking himself unsafe even there, hbe next

took refuge at: the court of Admetus king of the IVlo-

Themiltocles. That prince entertai~ned a frtong resent.
mnent: against him, on account of some fa~it of his ha-
-ving been harthly refused by the Athenians, while the
suithority of T'hemiffocles was at its height among that
people. Touchied, however, at f~eeing at his feet, and
in his p~-ower, 'the greatest man of Greece, he gave him
a kindly reception, ·and resolved to protent him.----.
WNe shall, by and by, f~ee the fate of T'hemiffocles.

Let us pow resume the general hiffory of Greece,

where we shall behold the glory of Aristides in full
splendor. The Athenians, at pref~eat in the undisputed
poireflion of the, principal authority in' Greece, and,
by consequ~ence, enjoying ulncontrolled influence in
the management of public affairs, resolved, in com-
pliance with the reqgueft of sev~eral of the Rtates, to put
the funds furnished for the purpose of the general de.
fence of the country on a new footing, by imposing on
each city a tax proportionable to its whole revenue. It
required a man of great integrity and difintereflednefs
Jo proportion and to collea this tax. Aristides was
unanimously pitched upon for that purporfe ;and he dif-
cha~rged the trust: repofred in him to the f~atisfaation of
all the parties concerned, and ~in Such a manner as did
bono~ur to the choice of his countrymen. The period
of his ad~miniffration is considered as the happiest in thre
hiffory of the Greeks. For, in the s~equel, under thie
manaagement of Pericles alid his successors, the increase
of unnecessary expences required the tax to be first
dtoubled, and after~ivards tripled.

It is hardly poffb~le to carry the contempt of riches

to a greater length than Aristides did. He even glo-
ried in his poverty. Of his sentiments on this head, he
~gave evident proofs in his -delfence of Calias, one of
the richest citizens of ALthens, to whom it was imputed
as a crime, that being rich, and the friend of Aristides,
hrle had nevertheless fu~ffered him to reimain i~n poverty.
But of this charge Ariffides fully juffified him, bH de'

claru~g

claring to the judges, that Callias had often pressed him
to accept of considerable sums, but which he had as of-
ten refus~ed, from a perfuation, that the want of riches
prevented. in him all desire of superfluities, and left hing
at liberty to apply himself entif~ely to the ~management
of public affairs. WThat magrranimity !

The keading men who finec~eede~d Aristides, reple-

nifhed A-thens with ibeautiful' porticos, with statues,
and witih other decorations ; but his (tudy, fagys Plu.
tarchb, was to adorn it with virtue . H7e was not always,
adds the faine author, a magiltr~ate ;, butf he was always
employed in the s~ervi~ce of his country. His house was
a public school for found policy, ivifdom, and virtue ;
and was ever open to all the Athenian -youth, who re-
paired thithe'r as if to consult an oracle, and were listen-
ed to and inf2-irtied by himi in the most familiar and
iobliging manner. Though he had`, on fieveral occa-
fions, given si-gnal -markEs of his courage,- as at the
battle of Marathon, when he supported the opinion of
M~iltiades, to march out and give battle to the Persians
in ·the open field, yet equity was his diftinguilhing cha-
rafteriffic, and procured him the: appellation of jufl
He poffeffced uncommon equality of temper, which did
not desert him even in his banish~ment, but enabled him
to preserve his affe~tion for his country, and to pe'tition
the gods in favour of his fellow-citizens,~ at the very
instant when they were treating him with the most cruel
ingratitude. His only o~bjeft was the glory of Athens;
and provided the were fauccef~sful against Iher enemies,
he was little folicitais whether it was by his m~eans or
those of another. Of this he gave a firong proof with
relpeQ to Themiffocles. After tharing with him the
whole danger and condua of the war, he never of..
fered to -dispute with ·himn the glory of the foccefs; but
fiiffered him- to enjoy it witho~ut a rival. ;Aristides was
mn all refpe £ts the p~erfe~t model of a good c tizen.

The- reader cannot fail to be anxious to know the

circurnitances attending the last part of~the life, aixd the
final exit of this great man. But hilborians have left

L, 3 a

as altogether in the dark ion that point. It is probable,
however, that he ended his days in peace. Hiffory
only informs us, that after pof~fefirng for a long while
the sole management of the publiF money,' he d~ied in
fisch absolute poverty, as not to leav~ ~fuffcicient funds th
bury him. But the republic charged itself with this-lait
duty to its best citizen; and likewYife with the care of
providing faitable matches for his daughters ( and his
son Lyfimachuas was maintainer3 in the Prytaneum at the
public expence.

It was nearly about the time of which we

4f55. are now speaking, that the Romans, having

heard of the wisdom of the Gr~eek -inflitutions,

se~nt ten of their citizens. to ~Athens to inform them.
Eelves of the different .laws there eltablithed. It was
bror the colleEtion made at Athens by thofq ten citi.
zens, that the laws of the twelve tables were composed,
which formed the basis of the after fyftern of Romnan ju.
rifprudence.

Ar taban us, captain of the guards to Xerges, feeing.

his sovereign difguff~ed with all attempts of conquea;
immersed in pleasure, and despised by his fubjeats, con-
' ceived the design of dethroning hian; and for that pur·
pose formed a conspiracy with one of the chief eunuchs.
Having; accordingly affaffinmated Xerxes in his chamnber,
he hastens to find Artaxerxes, surnamed Long~imanusJ,
that prince's third son ; acquaints him with the murder
of his father, and accuses Darius, the eldest son of
XLerxes, as the murderer. Artaxerxes believing the
villain, kills his brother in the frirt transports of his
rage, and mounts the throne. Artabanus forms a con·
federacy for dethroning the new king. Art~axerxes gett
ting intelligence: of this ~conspiracy, puts Artabanus to
death. The partisans of the latter, together with hiI
sons, to the number of fevren, all grown men, resolved
to revenge the death of Artabanus. This new confe-
derac~y against Acrtaxserses produced an open war, and
a bloody battle. But Artaxerxes prevailed in the endt
and extermiinated the greater part of his enemies. B~e:

so Pre

come at lait peaceable poffeffor of his kingdom, he dei
pofed' all his viceroys of whole fidelity he entertained
any furpicion; reformed many abules that had crept in
during the late reign; and acquired the charaaer of a
great prince.-W---e shall have occallon to make menle
tion of him more than once in the sequel.

Let us onc·e more look back to Themiffocles. The

Athenians, resolved not to permit him to remain in quiet
under the proteaion of KEing ALdmetus, require that
prince to deliver him up, under pain of their difplea-
sure. Themiltocles informed by Adm-etus of the di-
lemma into which he had brought himrfelf on his ac-
Count, determined, without hesitation, to retire to a
greater difiance still from his cruel and ungrateful coune
trymen. 171 goes on board of a thip; and after escaping
leveral dangers, arrives at Cumes in Armenia. The
Persian monarch having heard of his being profecribed
by his countrymen, had already set: a price on his head;
and iiflued orders, that all persons who arrived in any
part of the coast of his dominions thould be firiatly ex-~
amined. Themiffocles, however, foundr means to reach
Ealia unditcovered; and, by the friendship of his host,
a man of considerable subst~ance in that country, he
was· from' thence conduated in a covered wagg~on to
Suza; the condudtor of the waggon telling those he!
met, that the person conveyed in the waggon was an
lonian lady, w~hom he was- conduating to a nobleman at
court. He was permitted therefbre to pafLs without
further inlqu~iry, the ladies in Persia being always, carec
fully guarded from public view.

·As soon as he came to the court of Artaxerxes, he:
told that he was a Greek, and begged an audience of
the king. Being accordingly admitted into the royal
presence, he pr-offrat~ed hims~elf as uiual before the mo-
narch, and rnade a most moving speech to obtain his
proteftion. You fee at your feet, says~ he, Themi-·
flocles; a man who has inde'ed done much harm to the
Per sians, but who has it in his power to render them
important services. IMy life is in your powver, If you

L 4 save

save it, you will eternally oblige a man who begs it at
your hands; if you depriv~e me of it, you will destroy
the greatelt enemy of 0 reece. Artaxerxes was affoniih,
ed at his intrepidity, and could not help admiring him.
-He made him no ans~wer for the pres~ent ; but, on being
left alone, he gave hims~elf up to the highest trans~por~ts
of joy, crying out: from time to time, " I have Therni-
f' ftocles in my power.#'. Next day, however, after
deliberating coolly on this unforeseen event, he resolved
to aC& the generous part, and tor bind TL~hemniffocles to
his intler~efts, by loading him with favours. ,H.fe there-
fore called him into his presence ; received him in the
kindest and most obliging manner; .prefernted him wihh
200 talents, and questioned hira much about the affairs,
of (3reece.

T'hemiffocles, that he might be able to converse

more freely with Artaxerxes, applied hi'mfe~lf to the
Rtudy of the Persian language, and soon learned to speak
it. In the mean time, the Persian monarch was daily
giving him still greater and greater markso of favour,
;and on all occasions testified a particular efteern for
him. He married him to a Persian. lady of the higheftr
birth; made him his companion in all his pleas~ures; and
conversed with him with great familiarity-. His credit
was so bigh, that he was hims~elf amazed at it. It is
said, that being one day at table with his children, and
refleaing on the magnificence with which he was
treated, he could not refrain fr-om exiclaiming, "C Wie
c' had perithed, my children, if we had not pe~rithed.'
Hle fixed his residence at Magnesia, a city of Asia Ni-
rior, and continued there for the remaining part of his
life. ·T'he revenues of three cities were afi~gned: him as
a f~und of fabiffence.

After Cimnon had gained over the Persians the viao

vies already mrentioned, he returned to Athens, and
emnployed part of the spoils taknen from the enemy in
[os tifyTing Pircus, and emnbellifhing the city.

Cimocn was no les~s admired by the At~henians in

trime of peace, than he had been during the wtar. BeY

sides ere~ting various public ftruatures, both for the
itrength and for the ornament of the city, he planted
the academy with groves ; brought water into it, and
Igid· it out la delightful walks. He like wife planted plane
trees round the forum. He applied his riches to the
pobleift of purposes- He ordered his delightful gardens
to be at all times open to his fellow-citizens. H-e kept a
very plentiful but plain~ table, to- which all persons,
rich and poor, citizeris and firangers, were made wel-
some; and he afiftied with his wealth, not only his par-
ticrular friends, but the greater part of the Athenians,
As he walked throug~h the itreets of Ath~ens, the s~er-
vants that ·attended him had orders toa put money pri-
vately into the hands of all the poor citizens who came
in their way ; and to give cloaths to ficiih as se~emed to
fland in n'eed of them. But all this was done by Cinxon
w~ithout the smallest ostentation ; and without any in-
tention bs courting the favour of the people; for, in
point,of politics, he was inviolably attached to the party
of the nob~ility.

Being chosen to ~conduft another expedition against

the Per~sians, he ex~pelled them fr-om the Tihracian Cher-
fonefe, and laid siege to T~hafus, whose inhabitants had
revolted algainft the Athenians. This siege is remarkr-
able for its having continued three years ; and for the
obstinate resistance of the besieged, whereby they ex-
posed themfetlves to the severest misfortunes of war. It
wvas declared ca'pital for' anyjperf~on to talk of: surrender-·
ing; and the women seconded the efforts of the mlen,
even ·cutting off their hair to make rcrpes. The city,
accordingly·,· flood out till famine had carried off most
of its inhabitants.

Cimon next subdued all the country opposite to

Thrace, as far as M~acedonia, of which kingdom, too,
he wNas on the point of attempting the conquest.

Under these favourable circumflances the number of
jnhabitants in Attica appears to have been greatly en,
p~reafed. For notwithstanding a great loss of men in
~Ce course of the. war, they feat out large colonies, to

F ion

Eion on the river Strymon, to Amaphipolis in Macedo.
nia, and to the ifnland of Sciros.

Artaxerxes hearing of there important furcceffes of

Cimon, and of the incre~ase thence derived to the Athe.
nian power, propose~d to Themiltocles to take the com.
mand of a powerful army, which he had resolved to
fend against Attica. Such a' propos~al threw that illuffri.
ous exile into the greatest perplexity. Agitated on the
one hand by the firong affettion still retained by him for
his native country, and the thoughts of the dishonour
he thould draw on himself by bearing arms against it;
and, on the other 'hand, by the powerful festiments
of gratitude entertained by him towards a prince
who had loaded him with the highest favours; he
perceived that death alone could deliver him front
his diffrefsful situation. 3He resolved therefore to f~acri.
fice his life to his duty to his country, and to his gratitude

to Artaxerxes. Assembling his friends, he bade

q466. them a moving farewell; swallowed a draught of

bull's blood; and died at the age of fixty-five

years. A~rtaxerxes was firuck with admiration at this
initance of magnanimity, and highly regretted his dying
[o prematurely. But according to Thucydides, he did
not die by popifon, but by a na~tural disease.

Themiltocles poffeff0ed great magnanimity, invincible

courage, and an in~satiable desire of glory. ~He enjoy-
ed wonderful power of memory, unlcommton penetra,
tion and s~agacity, and a difpolition singularly aftive,
indefatigable, and perfeivering. W~e have seen, that it
was the most extreme necefirty which forced him to
take refuge with the enemies of his country, on find.
ing hims~elf persecuted in the most rigorous manner, by
a jealous and ungreatful people, whom he knew by ex-
perience to be capable of the greatest cruelty to those
who had rendered them the most signal services. Next
to 1Viltiades, whose fate was recent in his memory, he
was the principal author of their safety. He gained the
confidence and affe~tion of the allies, by his mild and
coedef~cending behaviour, and by his insinuating ad-

derefs,

dress· By his prudence he extinguilhed that spirit of
din-ord which prevailed among the Greeks at the time
of~ the P~ersian invasion, the fabliftence whereof might,
on that occallon, have proved fatal to them ; and he u-
pited them against their common enemy. He convinced
his countrymen, that their naval firength was their
greatest safet-y, and could alone procure them a fupe-
rioiety over the other dreeks: and to him principally
the Athenians owied their flkill in naval affairs, Hlis was
particularly diftingulfhed by an acute dis~cernment, and
an· accurate foresight wi-th rerpe61 to fu ture ev en ts.
Stratagem, indeed, and canning, were much emnploy,
ed by him: but in that refpeRt he a~ted from a prin-
ciple which, though perhaps wrong, was universally
adopted by his countrymen, namely, That every thing
w~hich contributed to the advantage or glory of the com.~
monwealth was lawful and laudable.
`About this time, the most violent earthquake ever
felt before in Greece happened in Laconia. Not only
were most of the houses thrown down by it, but the
earth opened and swallowed up several s~pots of ground
in that neighbourhood, The Helots, taking advantage
of this calamity, attempted to assert their liberty; and.
joining the ~I~e~fenians, made war on the neighbouring
Fities. The Lacedemonians wvere reduced to the ne-
cediity, of begging assistance of the Athenians. Cimnon,
thinking it ungenerous to take advantage of the mnis-
fortunes of a rival city, persuaded the Athenians to afiift
them; and mrarching himself into Laconia at the head
of 4000 men, he dispersed the Helots.

This is the proper place * to fix a celebrated

epoch. It was in the seventh year of the reign 467*
of Artaxgerxes, that the Israelite Ff~dras, that mo-
narch's cup-bearer, obtained permiffon of his royal ma-
fier to return to Jerusalem, to re-establish the Jewith re-
lgion, and to live according to~ the law. Thirteen

years

A f olemon contefi between the tragic poets Grit inflitated at

Athens. On this occaf~on Sophocles, only twenty- eight years old, was
Per~ferred to Efch~ylus, though then in the zenithl of his fame,

years after, and in the twentieth year of the reign of
ABrtaxerxes, Nehemniah, another of his cup-bearers, ob*
tained of that prince a decree, permitting the Jews to
rebuild the wadls of Jerusalem.

About this time Herodot~us began to write his hiffory.

It is remarkable, that the time of E~d'ras, the laR wniter
of sacred hiffory, and by whom the several bookrs of that
hiffory were ranged in their present order, -coincides
with that of the first writer of profane hiffory. The
sacred iritings, reckoning only from the time -of A.
brahamn, had then ediited for the space of fifteen cen-
turies.

To0 return to Athens. T~he' celebrated Pericles. had

lately made his appearance in public bufiners, and had
already acquired great influencq in the a~dminiffration.
Animated ~with a mnore ardent desire of glory than Ci.
mon, he was become jealous of the reputation of that~
illuffrious Athenian ; who, by his se~rvices to the Rtate:
and his liberality to his fellow-citizens, had gained their
ihigheft esteem. Pericles, therefore, resolved to oppose
him. Cimon was conne~ted withi the noblest famil~ies
of Athens. Pericles, on the other hand, in imitation
of the political condua of Themiltocles,- embraced the
party of the people; and omitted nothing to attraa the
attention and the favour of the crowd. It must be con.
feifed, that his extraordinary parts corresponded per-
sealy with his foarin g ambition. He pof fef fed uncom-
mon elevation of s~entiment, and a firiking dignity of
manner and deportment. He had received the anoft
important part of his education under the celebrated
philosopher Anaxagoras; from whom, besides natural
philosophy, he had learned a chaste and lofty fly~le.
Pericles had likewise fludied with much care the art of
government among his countrymen; and his singular
penetration quickly enabled him to manage their pailiqp~
and their prejudices to the best advantage. His quality
of senator gave him an opportunity of displaying to the
greateRa·-dvantage his powers of oratory, which he
ifefifed in a supreme degree. His natural clocution

~oS es nforcled by all the graces of a fine voice, and very
,,tivating exterior accomplishments, in so much. that
he. in a manner charmed the imaginations of hIs auds-
eince,.and managed them as he pleased. The boldness,
to,, and the impetuosity with ~which he spoke, so affo-
nifhed his hearers, that they fancied a resemblance be-
Ev~een his declamation and the thunder of Jupiter. This
procured him the app~ellation of Olympian. But find-~
ihggit nece~fary·, in order completely to gain over the
mpltitude to his fide, to rival Cimon in liberality, his
first -care wTas to insinuate himself into that branch of
trhe. adminiffration wihich regarded the management of
the public' flinds. It is appar'ent,. that in this employ-
me~nt' he by no means proposed to a~k on the rigid prin-
ci~ples of Ar~itides. He ,first obtained the conqluered
territories to be divided among the citizens ; and then
he procured a certain proportion of the public money
to be paid to each of them as a gratuity for their at-
tending the popular assemblies; a policy that -corrupted
tbe Atf~henians, and accuffomed that sober frugal people
to luxury and idleness.
SByj lavishing the public money in the most pro-
Efae and ostentatious manner, Pericles succeeded in
seducing the people to his fide. In the prosecution of
this plan, he received no opposition from his rival Ci-
mon. That great man being of a m~ild, candid, and
peaceable difpolritin, and of fentimnen'ts too elevated for
little political intrigues, enjoyed in quiet the fruits of his
former success, and placed his chief pleasure in tharing
his w~ealth with his fellow-citizens. Pericles therefore
made hasty advances towards the objeat of his am-~
bit~ion.

The Helots having about this time formed a new con-

federacy, made themf'elves mnafters of Ithome. The
Lacedemonians by a freth embassy begged assistance of
th'e Athenians; but, in c~onsequence of a s~udden change
of opinion, they very abruptly dififfiied the Athenian
tr'oops that had been sent to their af~iftance. T~his ca-
price greatly difguiited the Athenians. Cimon having

w6armly

tftarmly supported the' demand of the Lacedelmonians
and difplaiyed much seal in their favour, Periles and)
E~phintes availed th~einfelves of that circumstance, pri-
-irately to prepoifefs the people agfainft him, and to render
him fu~ietpeded C~imon wcas deftinied, like most of the
great men of this repuhibic, to have his services rewarded
with the punifhmnent of offracifixtr. Hf-e was banifhied for
ten years.

Pericles took advanitage of the lb~fencee of C~irnon, and

of his own credit with the people, to make innovations
In the est-ablished form of govemrnent. He deprivet)
the Areopagus of the payer of judging in the most im-
portant questions that had formerly belonged to their
juirifdiation ; he rendered the other courts of juff ice sub.
itrvient to his pleasure; and he bceame so absolute in
Athens,. that under this republicanl govermnent he
poffeft a power almost despotic.

The mif~underltan'ding which at this time took place

between the Spartans and Athenians, was the beginanin
of the mutual animosity that constantly afterw7ards fab.
sift~ed between those two slates, and brought to view the
[pirit of rivaolthip, with which they had long been freretl
animated against one another. The ijpirit of discord
broke out much about tire fame time among the other
·Rates of G-reece, and set them all in arms. As it is
unnecessary, and would be inconsistent with our plan,
to take notice of the particulars of all the petty wars
that -were the consequence of theli- disputes, we shall
content ourselves, with the most cursory mention of
them. W7e do this the more willingly, because a par:-
ticular detail of the _mifiery and fllau~ghter of which they
were produative would thock the humanity ofme
readers, without conlveying any precise or diftinEt ideas
to thos~e who take pleasure in the Rtudy 'of military
operation~s.

The inhabitan~ts of 'IVegara had formed a spirited re*

fJolution to render thems~elves independent of the Ar-
gives; but being totally defeated in an engagement boy
their oppressors, their city was belieged, and, in [pite he

the moit obitinate resistance, was taken and razed to the
garound. The Helots, after defending themselves in Ithome for
tn, years agaithft the whole Spartanr power, were at last
obliged to surrender; and being expelled .the Pelopon-
tiefe; fettled at Naupaans.

The ~Megarians, by renouncing their conne~tion with
the Spartans, and siding with the Athenians, excited
the jealodiy of the Corinthians, who on that account
fought two battles with the Athenians, in which each
party was conqueror mn its turn.

The inhabitants of Egina, aaoated by the fame mlo-

tives of jaloury·, likewise= declared war against the Athe-
nians, but were defeated in a f~ea-engagement by Leo-
crates, who blockaded their town. The Corinthians
having laid waste the territory of Megara, were totally
routed by the Athenians, who had come to the relief of
thatL country.

A war likewise breaking out between the ,Dorians and

Phc-seans, the former, supported by the Spartans, re-
naained the conquerors.

about the fame time a sh~arp engagement happened
between the Spartans and Athenians in the neighbour-
hood of Tanagra in Boeotia. Cimon, who was then in
banitihment, came to the field of battle, and begged per-
mniflon of his countrymen to ihare with them in the
danger of the engagement.-B-fut this they refused him,
on pretence of Tfupeaijng his intentions. He exhorted,
however, those of his tribe who were present, and lay
,under the fame furpicion of favouring the enemy, to
give proofs of their loyalty and fidelity. They obeyed
his -injundions so effea~ually, that every one of ·them
fell, fighting bravely, and the Athenians loft the battle.
Twoe months after, the Athenians had their revenge for
this ·defEeat. Under the command of Myronidas, one
of the belt generals of Greece, they totally vanquilhed
the Spartans, destroyed Tanagra, and laid waste Bceotia.

Egina having in the mean time capitulated, had its

tralls r~azed to the foundation.-About the fame time,

the Athenian c'ommander Tolmedes [nrprifed Giltheumi
a sea-port town of Laconia, burnt the Lgcedemonian
fleet, and defeated the inhabitants of Sicyon in battle.

~h'ile thie slates of G~reece were in this manner em.~

ployed in the mautual deltruCflion of each other,

463. tfhe Athenians, by the infligation of Inarus king

of Lybia,. undertook an expedition into Egypt,

which had lately revolted against the Persian power.
On their jun~tion ·with· the king of Lybia,. they gave
battle to the' Persians, put them to flight, and got pd.;
fefi~on of a part of Me~mphis. Next~year, however, the
fEene was greatly altered., For after several fruitless. as.
~faults, they were at last obliged to rais~e the siege of that
city on the approach of the enemy, and to retire to Bi.
blis, an island in the Nile. In this place they withflood
an eight months fiegfe. But their fleet happening to lie
at anchor in the Nile, the Persians, by changing the
course of the river, rendered the ground round the thips
dry, took every one of them, and put the g~reatest part
of their crews to the sword. The army being thus dif·
abled from opposing the enemy any longer, partly pe-
rif hed, and ,partly dispers~ed. Such was the event of this
unfortunate enterprize, in- which the Athenians confui
med fix years.

During the Egyptian expedition, Pericles, desirous of

diftinguithing himself in the charafter of a foldiet;, as
well as in that of ·a ftatefmnan, ravaged the coasts of La.
conia, and beat the Sicyonians in two engagements.

The Athenians becoming s~ensible at lait of the injuffice

of their treatment of Cimon, recalled him after five
years banifhle-nt. Sooni after his return, ,that gregat i
mnan £ucceeded in bringing about a peace between lus
countrymen and the Lacedemonians ; and with a view8
of diverting~ the APthenians, grown presumptuous by
their late good fortune, from making war on their
neighboars,' he resolved to find occupation for their arols

fecri-bes him as having been :au affeationate fort, a faith-
fol friend, a zealous citizen, a most fkrilful commander,
send to extremely lib~eral, as never to have been equalled
in generosity. WIe must add, that he had a thare in
aHl the important exploits of his time, and that he very
much increa'fed the naval power of Athens. It ap.
pears to have been a principal objeat with Cimon to
keep his countrymen in unremittingf amton, while at the
fame~ tirne he readily admitted the slightest pretences to
excof~e their allies· from personal fCervice. His motive for
this is obvious. The Athenians daily became more
warlike, while their allies grew effeminate and unac-
-quaintedn with the use of arms. W~hen young, he was
a ~great favourite of Aristides, who reclaimed him from
his extravagancies. In the fequlel Cimon imitSated his
friend in his di~iinterefiednefs and love of juffice*.

*~ A remarkable inflance of Cimon's difinterellednefs is r-ecorded

by Plutarch. A Persian of diflin~tion having incurred the res~eat-

procure Cimon's prote~tion, having offered that illuffrious Athenian
a magnificent present, Cimon alkedd him, "e whether he desired to

Boeotians, with the afif~tance of their neighbours, cut the.
Athenian army in- pieces, and killed their general Tol.
mledes. 1Megara revolts; and the Spartans make an ir-
r uption into Attica. Pericles, anxious to bring the war
to a conclusion, -privately corrupted Pliffonax king of
the Lacedemonians; and having by that means secured
the safety of Attica, failed against Euboea, and subdued
that island. The slates of Greece, weary of fiich an ex.
hauffing war, use their united endeavours to reffore
Fpeace ; which is at length concluded between the two
republics of Athens and Lacedemon, and their refpe~tive
allies, for the space of thirty years #.

Let us now turn our eyes to the admiiniff~ration of Pe-

ricles. To counterbalance his exorbitant power in A.
thens, the better· fort set up In opposition to him Thu.
cydides, the brother-in-law of Cimon, who exerted his
utmost: endeavours to curb Pericles, and to mnaintainr
the balance between the nobility and people. Pericles,
on the other hand, to retain the affeft~ion of the po.
pulace, entertained them with thows and feasts; took
mnto his .pay a great number of them to fer've on board
of a fleet he w~as fitting ,out; and eftablithed several
colonies in the Chersonese, both with a view to disburden
the city of a great number ;of superfluous idle people,
and likewis~e to hold the allies. in awe.-I~n alil thes~e un.
dertakings he profeffed to have no other aim than the
public good. After the example of Themiffocles he
Sannua-lly -augmente~d their navy with 60 thips, a policy
that, by displaying the power and firength of the
Athenians, rendered them formnidable to their enenues,
and respec~table among firangers. H-e divided the lands
c~onquered by the republic among the old disbanded
soldiers.

Pericles, by a judi~cio~us diffribution of proper rewards,

excited a noble spirit of emulation among the profeffors
of the fine arts ; and adorned Athens with the master-

pieces

* In the year before Christ 444, military tribunes with consular

power were created at Rom~e; .and next year cerfors: were for the

pieces of the ·most fkrilful artists. I utb cnw
ledged, to th~e honour of Pericles, that whatever works
of ·Greece, either in archite~ture, s~culpture, or painting,
have attra~ted the admiration of after ages, were the
fruits of his government, and of the attention bestowed
by him upon the most elegant f~ubje~ts. For many of
thos~e matterpieces we are indebted to Phidias the~ cele-
brated statuary, of whom the famous statue of Pallas,
to highly v~aluled by the best judges, was a capital work.
pericles r-eplenithed the city of Athens with ornaments
that attra·Eted the admiration of firanigers, and inspired
them atith a high idea of the Athenian genius and power.
- ·Athens assu~med a new face. Pomp and mnagnificence
supplied the place of its original fimrplicity. But the
best and most sensible citizens discerned, in this s~uperb
display, an approaching corruption olf manners. Peri-
cles, according to Cicero, was by thes~e men blame'd for
having exhauffed the public, money to fill the city with
super~fluous decorations.

SThe alie~s in the mean timen, and the enemies of Pe-
rides, complained loudly of his wantonly lavilhing: away
in those works the funds that ought to remain appropri-
ated for the exigencies of war. Pericles answered, that
the Athenians were by no means accoufitable for their
cronduat in this refpeRl to their allies, who oughit to be
satisfied with the proteEtion afforded them against: the iti
rupt~ions of the barbarians. HIe added, that the- works
at which they were pleased to take umbrage, furnish-
ed employment and fubliftence to a vast number of
extjmens.

But this was not all; the orators ors the opposite sac.

tion attacked him with great acrimony. Thucydides, in
particular, whose inve~lives were! tharpened by personal
animosity, harangued against him with singular keenners
and ability ; and the contest between Plericles and him
role to s~uch a heigh~t, that it became necessary that the
one or the other thould be banished. the city. Pericles's
a~ddress prevailed, and brought about the banishment of
his rival. Become now sole master in Athens, he dif.

and reigned abG5lute in its mnoft flourishin-g days.

Pericles perceiving his au\thority to be at last firmly

eftab~iihed, "and that the fa~vour of the people wras now
less neceifary to him, gave another- t~urn to the govern.
rnent, and inrfeniiblry circumforibed 'the power of th~e de-
mocracy. In this undertaking he myet with his uoal fuc.
cers, by means of his admiralble skill in managing the
minds of the multituide, and br-inging them to the· temper
he desired, by the force of his eloquence. His conduat,
too, was rrow perfe~itly irreproachable; and l-his only aim
seemed to be the public ad\Fantage. He poffeffe~d indeed
a no~ble difinterefied foul : for, during the long space
that he enjoyed the entire disposal of the public money,
his privtate estate did not appear to have been at all in.
creased i and excepti~ng the largeffes procured by him
for the· people, ari~d his expene~s in embel~lithin~g the city,
his man~agaement was ~guided bjr the most wife and pru.
dent oecomomny.

Thne fixred objeRt of Pericles's whole cond'uft was, to

raisE Athens to an unrivalled superiority over the other
£1ates of Greece. But though of diftinguiflhed personal
bravery, he appears on the whole to have been rather
averse~ to war, firom the most amiable of all motives, hu-
mranity- : and when unavoidably engaged in it, he s~eems
to have been careful, fi-ro the fame motive, never to
andertakie doubtful or haz~ardous enterprises, condufting
his measures so prudently as hardly ever to venture an
engagement.without a certainty of foccefs. All his war.
like operations were managed with consu~mmate skill;
.particularly his fuccefsfurl expedition into the Cherifonefe,
during which he fortified the Greek cities in that coun-
try, and by building; a firong well across the Isthmu-s,
se-cured it against the inroads of the Thracians. He led
an expedition as far as the kingdom of Pontus. He re-
established, by force o~f armls, the Phocians in the ma-
nagement of the temple of Delphos, whereof they had
been difpoffeffed by the Laedemonians. -He entirely s~ub

fabdned Euba~ea, and rendered the Athenia~n power eve-
ry. where refpe~table.

In - the ·dispute- between the Samnians and M/ilefians,
the Athenians sided with the latter, by the perfuaio~n of
Pericles; who Setting fail for Samnos with a fleetr
of- 4o thips, there established demnocrac~y, and 44 I.
left a garrison in the town. After his departure,
ithe.citizens, who had withdrawn themselves on his ap.
proach, having received a reinforcement from -the go.
verntor of Sainos, entered the town by night, and put
all the garrifion to the fwiord. Pericles getting intel-
ligence of this, returned with a greater force than be-
fore, defeate~d the Samzian fleet, and bloc~kaded th~e
t~Ewn. Inm vain did the Phenicians come to its relief,
Pericles having received 'an ad~ditional reinforcement,
battered the walls- with foch vigour, that he obliged the
Sami~ans to capitulate, and to pay the expences of the
war. This exploit added greatly to the reputation and
gloy of Peri~cles.

The Corcyrea-ns likewise, find~in~g themselves unable

to make head against the Corinthians, who had' atta~ck-
ed them, implored the affi~tance of the Athenians.
The= Corinthians too, on their part, sent~ deputies to A-
thens, which for a considerable time krept the public re-
solu~tions. in f~ulpenfeii. Bumt the C~or cyreans so far pre-
vailed at laift, as to procure themse~lves to be received in-
to tjal·ace twaith the Athenians ; who did not, however,
choos~e operily to declare war against the Corinthians,
behag by no means displeased to fe~e those two powerful
maritutt~e Rtates weakening each other by their mutual
quarr els.

The Athenians, grown insolent from their fuccers,

wantonly attaicked every itate which they even fiifped-ed
to be an enemy. They commanded the inha~bitants of
Potid~ea not only to demolish the walls of their city on
the Pallenus fide, but likewise to difmaifs the magittrates,
whom, as a Corinthian colony, they ha~d received from
Cornath. . The Cor-inthians, provokred at this inflance
of the A~thenian injustice, declared wara against, themn-,

Mb~ 3 and~

-and sent an army into the territory of Potidea. An en.
gagfement ensured, in which viaory declared for the
Athenians. In this battle Alcibiabes, as yet a very
ytoung man, and his master Socrates, chiefly diftin-
guithed themselves. That philosopher was obs~erved to
s~upport the fatigues of war with an ease that must h~ave
been the consequence of the hardy temlperate life to
which he had inured himself ; and in the salton he be-
haved with a courage that would have done honour to
the bravelt veteran. On this occasion he procured the
prize of valour to be adjudged to his scholar Alcibiades,
intending by that means to inspire him with a love of

glory. This advantage of the Athenians did not at all sub.
due the resistance of the Potideans, who res~olved to
complain to the Spartans. These readily espoused their
qu~arrel, and secretly prevailed with Perdiccas king of
M/acedon to take arms in th~eir behalf. -A battle ensured,
in which th~e Atheniatis havingf broken the mnain body of
that prince's army, obtained the viaory, and laid siege
to Potidea. The C'orinthians having likewise complain.
ed at Sparta, obtained, likre all those who had been in.
juried by the Athenia~ns, a very favourable hearing
from the Lacedemonians, who at last declared the peace
to be infringed on the part of thle Athenians, and pro-
claimed war against them.

It is certain, that the overgrown power of the Athe.

nians ; the prefuzmption ninfpired by the viaories over
the Persians, of which they attributed the whole honour
to themselves;S their affeatation of superiority over the
Spartans; and their overbearing behaviour to their al-
lies, by assuming to themselves an exclusive power of
judging~ In every matter that concerned the whole confe-
deracy ; had at this time offended all their neighb~ours.
The L~acedemonians, therefore, and the other slates of
Greece, thought it now highly neceffaryy to ·humble their!
piride -; and f~or that purpose made use of every pretext
to juffify an open declaration of war.

~During their ho~stile prepar~ations, the Lacedamonirans

endeavoured to cover their resolutions with the appear-
ance of equity. Akmong other old fubjeats of dispute
revved by them, they required the Athenians to re-
(fore liberty to the cities over which they h~ad assumed
an authority; and particularly to abrogate a l~aw made
by them against the inhabitants of Megzara. Pericles
anilvered their complaints with great strength of argu-
ment, He demnonfirated, that these were by no means
fuf~ficient grounds for a war, and at the famue time
convinced the Athenians, that: they had no reason
to be alarmed at the threats of the Lacedemonians,
being in a much better si-tuation to foapport a war than

they. At this time the enemies of 3Pericl~es, not daring open-
ly to attatckE himself, vented their resentment against his
friends, and framed accofations againlt P~hidias, Af~pa-
fia, and Anaxagoras. The first was accused of having
embezz;led large sums of rooney, deffined for the con-
ftrualon of his statue of Mainerv~a. But this assertion his
accusers were unable to makre good. Then he was ac-
cured of having engraved representations both of Pericles
and of himself, upoix the part of the shield of that god.
defs w-hich exhibited the battle of the Amazons 3 a piece
of vanity sorely very pardonable. For no greater erime,
however, was Phidi~as condemned to an, im~prifbunmeur,
in which' he is said to have ended his days. But some
authors believe that he was only banished.

The. second, Afpatia, was accused of impietyl and a

.aiforderly life. This lady was renowned for her wit,
her beauty, her eloquence, and her ex~traordinary poli-
tical abilities. The most distinguished men at Athens
took pleasure in liflening to her conversation. Socrates
himself used to fay, that of her he learned rhetoric.
Pericles, in- particular, was exutremely fond of A fpatia;
m so much, that he was even believed to have married
her. He ~therefore charged himself with the care of her
defence; and pled her cause with such force of argu4
ment, and so pathetically, that the judges, aif~eaed with
his tears, pronoun~ced her innocent.

M' 4 The

The last, Anamcagoras, was accus~ed. of maint-aising

doC~rines contrary to the efla~b~lifhed religion; beca~use
he taught .and pretende'd ·to account for the moti~on of
the heavens ; and affirm~ed, that the regular andr beautti.
fu~l order visible In the d~ifpolition· of th~e un~riverfe, must
be the work of one fuprerae Being, poff~effe~d of perfeia~
intelligence. That philosopher, sensi~ble how dift~kuk it
is to combat the fixuperititioins prjejdices of a bigott~ed
populace,- thought it hi~s wis~est course to secure himfdg~
by flight.

It was- at present: the interest of Pericles to eng~age

the Athenians in a war ; for they had alread~y passed a
law obliging him to render an account of the public
money. T~o avoid the florts· that threateaed him, he inl
dulgfed the Athenians in ~their inclination for war, which,.
by emllploying them about a b~usiness mzore urgent, and:
more direatly interest~ing, might not only divert themI
fromt prying minutely into his preceding management of
the public funds, but might likewise give hi~m addit~ion~al
importance in. the slat~e, by obliging them, in the con-
du61 of the war, to have frequnent relcou-rfe to his coun--
fel and di~reftion.

T'he people, in the~ mean time, held an affertb~ly: to

deliberate on the dem~ands of the LZaedemon-ians. Pe-
r.icle-s, on this occasion, jurti~fied the measures of the
Athecnians with admirable eloquene. Hle demonfira-ted;
the demnands of the Lakedem~onianss to be no ot~her than~
affrated pretences, under which they hoped to conceal
their jealoujry, the real mptive of their: condu~t, as they~
could n~t behold, without an envious eye, the Athe-

mieafures controuled by fiich enemies; and that the
fwaAor-d was the shortest andJ the only method tp fe~ttle the

to undertakce this war, he gave them- a flattering de-

Contiaining th~e hijory: of the .PelZoponnejiatn zroar.

TH wr hat nowr ensued amuong the Greeks is

no~wn in hi~iory by the name ~of the Peloponnejian

watr. It was of twenty-f~eren years duration 5 and was
attnd~ed, with an immnenf~e expence, and a~n incredible.
eafaion: of bilood. In the course of it, each partey ex-,
penienced the moif cruel reverses of fortune ; and; dif-
play~ed a coraige that might have procured them, if
united, the greateR advantages over their comm~ton, enew
mies. ThucydZidses writes the hiffory of the first atwenty·-
one ylea~rs. of this war, and Xenophon continues it,

h ~has already been obierv~ed, that the je~alooly·, con·-

reived by the other Rfates of Greece, of the exorbitant
power of the Athenians, was the mrn~e harmediate occa-
Seoa of thirs war. All the Rate~·s wi~thin the Peloponnese,
except the Argives al~one, j~oined· the Ljacedem~o~nia
who were further supported· by the Il~iegarians, Lo-
emiams, Boeotians, and fomne others. T~ihe Athienians,
oa, the other hand, were supported: by the inh~abitants
of Chzios and Lesbos, by the city of Plat-ea, and all theig
tributary- countries, such as, lonia, the ~Hellerpant, the

Fa~ pof~ Theacse, &c.

Hfoftilities

Hostilities were begun by the Thebans, who

43 I. attacked Platea, a city of Boeotia, in alliance, as

we have just: mentioned, with Athens. All

Greece was immediately in motion. The Lacedems.
~i~ans march towards the isthmus of Corinlth, a: narrow
neck of land, about fix miles b~road, which joins the
Peloponnefie to the country properly called Greect.
Archidamus, one of the Spartan kings, before advan.
cing farther, dispatches an ambassador to the Athenians,
to require of them to relinquish their pretensions. But
the Athenians command the messenger to retire, with-
out deigning even to give him an atadierice. The La.
cedemonians thereupon advance towards CAttica with
an army of 60,000 men, while that of the Athenians
amounted to no :more than m8,ooo; but, to make up
the odds, the latter had a fleet of goo" gallies. On the
approach of the Lacedemosnian army, -the inhabitants of
the country abandoned their habitations, and, carrying
away every thing they could, took refuge in Athens..

The plan of operations pursued at this time by the-

Athenians, on the fiiggeftion of Pericles, was, to weary
out: the enemy, by protra~tingF the Nar. T~he· Lace-
demoriians entering Attica, laid siege to Enoe. But
being obliged, after a few fmruilefs assaults, to re·
'linquiih that attempt, they advanced Hitll nearer to
Athens, and encamped within half a league of the city.
Pericles, unwilling, while so much inferior in point'of
numbers, to hazard the fate of the republic in a gene-
ral b~attle,- found it difficult to prevent the Athenians,-
..exasperated at the fight of the ravages committed on
their country, from sallying forth upon the enemy.
B~ut by means of his admirable art in managing the
multitude, he kept both the senate and people from as-
femnbling to deliberate, though at the expence of none-
berlefs insults from his enemies; in spite of which he
persisted in his plan, unmoved either by threats or wn-
treaties. In the mean time he dispatched a fleet of loo
thips to ravage the coasts of the Pelopounefe; -which
Being joined by that of the allies, made a descent upon

Laconia,

3Liabcnia, and laidi waste the territory of Sparta. The
Lacedemornians, finding all their endeavours to draw
th~e Athienians out of their city ineffeatual, and receiving
tide~lligence of the ravages committed in Laconia by the
Athenian ~fleet, foundl themselves under the necefirty of
Ai~thdrawing from Attica.

·On the setting out of the expedition against the coast

of Laiconia, in extraordinary ecipfe of the fan happen-
etd, ;just as Pericles was going on board of his galley.
Pekiicles perceiving the Athenians to be terrified~ at this
phen omenon, which they considered as an unlucky pre-
sage, threw his cloak over the face of the pilot, ·and adk-
ed himn if he saw? The pilot having a~rtfwered in the ne-
gative, P'ericles explained to the byffandcers, that the bo-
idy of the moon, being in like manner interposed at· that
initant between their fight and the fun, prevented them
froni feeing his light.

Wihen the L~acedemonians retired out of Attica, the

Athenians appropriated I so talents of money, and I oo
of their best thips, for the more immediate defence of
their country, in cafe of a freth invasion, prohibiting
anjr person, under pain of death, from proposing a dif-
ferent application of 'thofe resources. They then expel-
led· from the island of Egina its present inhabitants,
wphom they regarded as the principal cause of the war ;
aDd: they divided' that island by lot among the citizens of
Athens. They made an alliance with the kings of ~Ma-
cadon and Thrace; subdued the island of Cephalonia ;
laid waste the territory of Megara ; and took the harbour
o~fNifeum.? This concluded the firit campaign.

The Athenians nert: cele~brated f~uneral rites ·to the
triem~ory of those who had fallen since the beginning of
the war. For this purpos~e, a large tent was confiruQ-
.cid, wherein they exposed the bones of the· slain, which
wrer~e covered with flowers and perfumes thrown on
thiein by those that went to fee them. Then the bones
were carried with much pomp and s~olemnity to a s~ub-
or~ ·of the city called Gerta~mices, where they were de-
poi~fteFd in a ansnoanuent rdeftined to be the tomb of those

timne· feeed to outd a himself ; and: in pronouncing the
col~ogium of those who were no more, he omitted no ar.
gumlent that might inflame the courage of th-ose who re.
mrained. Thucydides has pref~e~v~ed this famous, o~ration,
of which the beauntifurl exrprellions and lofty sentiments
a-re equal~y adtmired *e.

The armsy of the Lacedemoninans,, and theiar allie, re.

turned into Attica, and laid eve3ry thing wa~e with fire
and sword. B~ut the plaguc ~which~ then raged among the
Athenians, was ftili more pernici~ous3 to them,4 depriving
them of their bes k tizen~s and bravest soldiers·; and
Lthen~s exhi~bited~ nothing but a mkelanholy s~ense of
sickness and death.

g~arding the refezztanent denounced against him and his
country by that prince, continued in Athens till the
plague had entirely ceased. The Athenians, as a re-
warid for his af~efufl care, presented him with the freedonn
of their; city, assig~ned him ahandfomae maintenance for
li~ie rin the Pry~taneumsa, an~d gav7e him a crown of g~old,
o~fthe vtalue of abou.L. 200 -Sterling.

Pericles, in the mean time, s~ent out a det~achment~ of

40oo foot, and B oo horse, on board a fleet of 1 od
galleyi with orders to rayvage the Peloponnese. This
divser~doin obliged the Peloponnefians to return home to
the defence of their own country. But the Athenians,
diltre~Fed ~by the was~te committed on their territories by
the eerney, murmured bi~tt~erly at the conduat of Pe-
r~ids, ·and sent propo~sals of peace to Sparta. The LaL
ced~emonians having refuled to hearken to any accom-~
modation, the complaints were renewed against Pericles,
who ~at last affemnbled the people, and endeavoured to
juffify his meafuores. But their present fuzfferings out.
txeig~hed his eloq~uence ; and they not only deprived
him ·of all power, buts likewise imapofed on him a
heav-y fine.

Nor were the diffreffes of that great man confined to
his public Rtation alone. They were heightened by
others of a domestic nature. His own son lan~tippus,
a y~oung- man of an expensive turn, unable to bear
thefitriat cconomny of his father, was the first to com-
plain of his condult; as if it were not~the duty of a
son to Tubmit with patience to the meas~ures of his
father, even although he thould carry his frugality to
an extreme. Pericles had the misfortune to lose this
son, with several others of his relations and friends, by
the plague. But amidst all his affi~ions, his fortitude
never forsook him.

The Athenians beginning to be hardened by their

Euffer-ings, repent of their severe treatment of Pericles ;
and finding by experience, that they had at present no
<tther person capable of direfting their affairs, they in-

treaS

treat him once more to flep forth and undertake the
admniniffration *.

Potidea, in the mean time, unable any longer to sup.

port the mniferies of, famine, which had produced the
most dreadful calamities among its inhabitants, is obli.
g~ed.to ~u~rrender. Its few remaining: citizens were forced
to abandon it for ever; and the place was repeopled with
Athenians.

The Pelo~ponnefianis, about this time, invefied Plateca,

a city in alliance with Athens. This siege is not only
remarkable for the obitinate resist-ance of the besieged,
but for being the firit recorded in hiftoy which was
con-du~ed with any fort of regularrity, Both parties
here made use of mounds of earth,, the one to attack,
the other to defend, TIhe Pelopennefians burnt a part
of the town, by means of. bundles of flicks, to which
they s~et fire. On the other hand, the besieged net
gleated no ex~pedient to fruffrate the various attempts
of the enemy. But the most surprising circumffance of
all is, that so small a. place as Platea, which containcd
no more than 400 inhabitants, and 8 o Athenians, was
capable of making so vigorous a resistance againR a
powerful army. The enemy at last changed the siege
i·nto a blockade, and surrounded the town with two
ditches. The Boeotians were left to guard these: enl
trenchments, and the bulk of the army marched away.

About .the fame time the Aethenians were beaten mn

an engagement by the Chalcidians, a people of Thrace,
and purs~ued to the very gates of Athens. But their
viaory at Naupa~us made amends for that difaffe.~
Phormion attacked, near that place, a Peloponnesian
fleet of 46 vessels, took I 2 of. them, put the reit to
flight, and entered Athens in triumph. Brafidas and
Cnemus, two Spartan officers, having failed against Sala.
mis with a fleet of 4 o vessels, made a descent upon that
island, and laid it waste. Thit,

* A~bout this thne the Athenians, to repair the devafkations oc·>

fioned by the plague, passe`d a law, glowing all the male citizeec
malrry .each two wives. Socrates is said to have been the firit ~
took the benefit of this law.

This year was rendered. remarkable by the

42.death of Pericles. Plutarch says he died of the

plague. Other authors write, that he was worn

out by a languishing consumption. It is reported of him,
that a little while before his death, on hearing some of
his friends extolling his viaories, (for he had ereaed
no fewer than nine trophies), he told them, ~that they
overlooked a more glorious circumfkance itill, namely,
that he had never, on any private personal account, given
callfe to a single fellow-citizen to wear; mourning. His
death was universally regretted by the Athenians. He was
uniqueftionably one of the g~reatest men that Athens ever
produced ; having displayed on all occasions~ uncommon
malgnanimity, and thown hims~elf per ealy qualified
for. every office that he undertook. The absolute power
that he enjoyed in this republic for the space of 4o yearsyi
wvras wholly attained by his admirable eloquence, which
was to powerful, as to triumph even over the prejudices
ard passions of his oppofers, and to bring them over to
ihis views,--the perfe~tion of that admirable talent. A-
thesis flourished while Pericles held the helm of govern-
mtent.

Ahthough no oration of his o~wn composing has reach.~
ed to our times, yet, from the effeAs of his eloquence,
and 'what is reported of it by bhitorians, he may be just-
ly-placed at the head of the Grecian orators. By Cicei
ro's account, it was he that introduced into Athens a
take for perse& eloquence. He had learned of Angaxa
goras all the principles of perfuation; and his own ge-
niua diredted him to employ thos~e principles to the great-
eft advantage. On account of the force and vehemence
of his declamation, he was said to thunder and lighten;
andl to denote the beauty of his language, and his firength
of arguament, the goddess of perf~uation, with all her
graces, was fCaid to dwell` on his lips.

It was this power of eloquence that enabled hinx
bordly to oppole the unreaso~nable ·defres of the Athe-
anans; preserved to him, for the space of forty years,
ati absolute power among that most fickle and capricious

people;

mIn~ind~, that he ~ch-an~gd eiren thbeir~ f~y~em of governs

emrploy~ed them in what~ he reckoned the good of the
comm~nonwearlth, in promoting the libreral ·arts, and in
dcorating and ornamnenting th·e ·city. The Athe-
nRians ·beca~me daily more and more sensible of thle great
lefbs thf3ey had Edt~ained by his death ; for ~his s~uccessors
in the government, at the fa~me time that they wanted
has expen-ence, were much mnferror to him mn pomnt of
natural abilities, and appeared to be more concerned
about their private interests than the good of the com-
monwealth #.

Anaxagras the philosopher diled the fame year, and

tha~t wlibix P~ericles was informed of his situation, and of
thtefb;·~·,ilution he had formed of starving himself~ to death,
hie we~nt to fee him, with an intention to diffhade him
from ;hi~s desig~n, But Anaxagoras answered him in

that, as a'n admirer of the drama, I entertain much gratitude
to Pericles, as its chief patron, I cannot severely blame, even in a
Polti 11ight, his partiality for theatrical reprefestations. To di-

It andu however be admitted, that the slate of the times, and the
unreasonable desires of the Athenian mob; or, in other words, that

fgtca neeftyfometimes forced Pericles to adopt measures which

cedemon at the fame time. The ambassadors were told
by the L~acedemonians, that they thould be fully heard
at the approaching Olympic games, where the other al-
lies would have an opportunity of afif~ting at the con.
ference. Thucydides has transmitted, to us the import
of what was urged by those am~bassadors; from wvhich
we fee, that they admitted the~ treatry anciently conclu-
ded· betwpeen the Lesbians and Athenians, and assigned
thre amnbition of the `latter, not their p~refeat misfortunes,
as the reaSon that induced them now to relinquish that
treaty. The allies were satisfied with their reasons, and
admitted them into their confederacy.

It was likewise res~olved in this assembly, to prosecute

the war more vigorously than ever against the At~thenians;
who, recewmig adformatxon of the great preparations ma,
king against them, fitted out a fleet: of I on Fail, appear.
ed unexpe~tedlyf off the promontory of the Isthmus of
Corinth, and .made a. defeent upon the Peloponnese,
while another Fleet prote~ted~ the coasts of Attica. Ne-
vrer had they raised so formidable an armament before;
and it to overaw~ed the Lacedemonrians, that they has
r~ied back to the -defence of their own country. The
Athenians, in the mean time, pushe~d on the siege of
WMityl'ene, whither they' sent a. detachment of I ooo fol·
diers, and the town was blocked up both by sea and
land. The inhabitants receiving no affiliance from the
~kLacedemonians, and being pressed by famine, w~ereob-
lige~d to surrender at discretion. The authors of the re
volt, to the number of more than r 00*, were conveyed
to Atthens, and there put to death. Orders were at the
famle tim~e iffirud to mzhji3affcre the rleft of the inhabitants,
by way of example. But the people, thocked at such
horrible cruelty, caused the det-ree to be revoked, and
dispatched counter-orders ; which luckily arrived at the
initant they were proceeding to put the first in execo-
tion. Then the town was dismantled, and the whole
territory of the island, except Methymne alone, was di
vided by lot among the inhabitants of Athens.

us ~~one half of them effeaed by a very daring ftra-
tangp, fuggefied and executed by derpair. The re-

Na 2 Lacedemonians

~Lacedemonians, delirous to recover this place, besieged
it by fear and land, and it became the scene of extraor.
dinary feats of bravery. But the Lacdemonians having
thrown a detachment of 4oo of their best troops into the
little island of Spha~eria, the Athenians surrounded the
iflanda, arid cut off aSll iippies of provfifxns. The Lace.
demnonians, anxious to save thoi'e troops, fee thernfelves
reduced to the necediity of sending ambassadors to Athens
wICiffth popofals of pace.

The ambalaf~dors.frankly owned the extremae neceility

that had obliged the Lacedemronians to s~ubmit to so humi-
liartng: a fiep, put the ~Athenians in mind of the uncertain
fate of arms, and exborted them to embrace this oppor-
tunity of refforing tranquillity: to Greece. But the A.
thPenians grown presumptuous by their g~ood fortune, as
well as by the -flattering -orations of their favourite de.
Inagogue Cleonr, required, as a preliminary condition,
that the troops confined in the island thould lay dowRn
thieir arms, and be condnated to Athens, upon the pro-
msife of the Athenians to set thems at liberty, as soon as
the L~acedemnonilans had delivered up the places con-
quered by them from the Athenians. T~he Lacedemo.
nians refufriing to complyr w0ith thlis condition, both par-
ties prepared themselves for war.

The Athenia~ns, in the mean time, were very vigilant

to preven't any provisions from passing into the island of
Sphladeria. The Lacedemonians, on the other hand,
endgaged the whole coulntry round to contribute their ut.
most efforts to relieve the Ibefieged troops, and prooifed
to set free all the slaves who thould succeed in carrpti~g
them provisions ; wnhich many did, at the extreme hazard
of their lives. In the mean time, the Athenians in Pylus
·began, on their part, to be firaitened for provisions. Cle-
on perfunded the ·people, that the flowners of the siege
was owning to the inaaivity of their commanders; a"B
maintained, that a little vigour must very fboo redrce
the island, which he offered to accomplish himself. tha
ving been accordingly s~ent thither, and having joined
Deanofthenes, they landed together in Sphaaenia, *O

bege:the-enemy to the extremity of the island. The La-
cedeonins, however, took poifeimon of a fortificat~ion,
and -defendedI, with the moftf deijperate courage, the only
pia ae by which~ they couald be attacked. But the ge-
iieat2of the Mleffenians having discovered a difficult pass
that ,led to the fortification, marched that wc~ay, and
appearing unexpe~tedly on the rear of the Lacedemno-
nians, called aloud to them to lay down their arms. The
I~cde~qemonians, exhauffed with heat and fatigue,o~beyed
the summ~ons, by laying their thields on the grotmad; and,
SaE&t~t a thort· conference, they f~urrenderedE at dircenreon.

nated by a son of one of the concrubines of Artaxerxes,
named Sogdianucs, who furcceeded him in the kingdom.
fiiepbloody difpolition of Snogdianus soon rendered him
the terror of the nation; which revolted against him,

throne. Ochos, finding himself sEcure in the kingdom,
initead of the name of Ochurs, affummed that of De~aris;
Aughlr·locrians, to distinguish him from other kings of
P~edla of that. name, f uperadded the title of .Nothsz,

powrer of the slate to thr-ee Eunulchs. His reign was
difitrbed with continual troubles. The Egyptians, in
pyrticular,. revolted, and e~xpellted the Perfians,trom their
cou~ntry. Nicias being chosen one of the Athenian comnmand-
ees, reduced the islands of Cythera and Thyrea, and exr-
terminated all the Eginette, who had .taken refuge there.

NM 3 --ThefeT

-Thfe Eginetse were the profefifed and inveterate ene·
mies of the A~thenians.

The war of Sicily begins. It was occasioned by a

dispute between the cities of Syracuse and Leontium;
the latter of whiich having procured the support ojf the
Athenians, prevaile'd with them to ferid out a fleet of
-to thips to their assistanc~e. B~ut·, in the mean time, thre
·Greeks of Sicily growinlg jealous of the Athenians,
whom they ufupe~ted of a desig~n to make themselves
masters of the island under the pretence of assisting one
of the parties, made peace with each other.

The sedition of Megara happened next. The inha-

bitants of that town, after expelling their mnagiftrates,
quarrelled among themfrelves, one party being for re.
ctalling their magifh~rates, the other for delivering their
town into the hands of the Athenians. Brafidas, in the
mnean time, the best officer the L~acedemnonians then had,
having come before IVregara, its gates are im~mediately
thrown open to him. The exiled magiffrates returning
Fbons after, and resuming their authority, condemn to
death Icoo inhabitants of thre oppsfite faaion. BrafidaS
advances into Thrace, subdues several cities, and lays
siege to Amphipois, a place of much importance to the
Athenians, who thence got the g~reatest pqart of their
woriod. They therefore dispatched Thucydides, the fa·
mnous historian, to its relief ; but the place was taken
before his arrival. His countrymen, however, imputed
to him the loss of the place, and banished him at the in-
fligation of Cleon. The APthenians having about the
fiame time advanced into Boeotia, under the command
of Demosthenes and Hippocrates, were defeated near
D~eliuml by the Thebans; who, after their viatory, be-
fieged and tookr that town.

No decisive advantage had been hitherto obtained by

either party. The Athenians and Lacedemonians,
therefore, agreepl on a truce for a year; which Brafi-
das, wuho had b-een ~fuccef~sful in all h~is en terprif~es, boke
writh great impatience. Cleon, on the other hand, who
had aEquired much authority in Athens, by meansby

is :Bold and vehement eloquence, incited his country-
mcr to ·refisme the war.· Bemng more pres~umptuous
than fkrilful in military operations, he resolved to at-
tempt the retaking of Amphipolis, hoping to be assisted
b~a body of troops from P~erdiccas king of IVIacedon,
But Brafidas got the start of him, and threw hamfelf in-
to the town. Tro increase the presumption of -Cleon, the
S atan general, who was well acquainted with his cha-
paP r affedtd to be afraid to encounter him. But as-
ter making the proper difpolitions, Brafidas sallied forth
onexpeltedly, and attacked the left wing of the Athe-

n~fs, wvhich being the flower of their army, made a vi-

usos refiliance. Brafidas, however, at last broke

'them, and killed 600 of them, with very little los~s on
hi~s own fide. T~dhis attack disconcerted and terrified
Clears, who was killed by a Spartan soldier as he was
Blyig from the battle. Brafidas was of the number of
th~e slain on the fide of the Lacedem~onians. He was an
excelent o~fficer, equally brave and prudent, and de-
serves- to be ranked among the Lacedemonian .heroes..
It was the mother of this general, who, on hearing the
extploits of her son commended, ans~wered, -"C It is true
*L my son was a brave man; but I doubt not that Spar-
iL to has many citizens as brave as he." As for C-le-
onl, he merited no· regret, having been no more than an
inib9lehtt boaster, of a cruel overbearing disposition, and
very· avaricious.

'The Lacedemonians, in the mean time, apprehensive
leftthe Helots th~ould take advantage of the prefept bad
pollure of their 'affairs, and revolt, used them wnth the
snor;t barbarous perfidy. Having decoyed the bravest
of thiem to Sparta, under pretence of givmyg them their
liberty, they are said to have murdered no fewer than
2000 of them ; a rilriing instance, to what excess of
barbarity a people, that is guided by no other motive
than ·a blind hard-he~arted policy, wdril proceed .

Us~rte Athenians, since their late disaster, began to

think seriously of peace ; to which the Lacedemornaus
rr~t'e likecwif~e well disposed, being desirous to recover

N~ 4 9o

from captivity their brave citizens who had been taken
at Sphac~teria. After mutual con~ferences, a peace was

agreed on, for the ipace of fif~ty years, between

4 q2 x. the t wo republics and their refp~e~ive allies.

This work was greatly forwarded by Nicias, wh~o

was as worthy a citizen as he was a fkcilful general.

The war was nothing less than concluded by this

peace. Before the expiry of the first year, discord
sprang up afresh between the Athenians and Lacedemo.
nian~s, both s~ides breathing nothing but war. Alcibia-
des, who was now beginning to appear in the public
assemblies of the Athenians, was principally a~ive inl
opposing the means of .reconciliation propos~ed by 19i
cras.

Alcibiades had been educated by his uncle Pericles,

whlo difrcovered in him, while very young, extraordinary
natural parts, and a singular mixture of good -and bad
qualities, Socrates, too, entertained the most tender
fEriendfhip for him, and took delight in initilling into his
mind the most vatluable branches -of every kind of know-
ledge. That best of philosophers laboured chiefly to inc
fpire' his feholar with the purest maxrims of morality, to
fortify him against the power of the pafi~ons, and to pre-
s~erve him from the dangerous allurements to vice, to
which his you~th and wealth expofied him. Alcibiades,
sensible of the affec~ion of Socrates, and charmed with
the graces of his conversation, listened attentively to the
leifons of his matter; though his natural inclination for
pleasure, and the fedr~iaon of his companions, made
him frequently forget them.

At h-is first appearance in public, Alcibiades displayed

a daring fa~ious genius capable of the boldest and mast
hazardous designs. Though addic~ed to pleasu~re, even
to debauchery, he was so perfealy matter of his pal-
fions, that he could ac~commodate himse~lf, with ease, to
the humour and way of life of every person with whom
he had occallon to convierfe,bhowever different from his
own. He was a rake in lonia,--temperate and au-
fiere in Sparta, -and, in Persia, he exiceeded the natives

in, luxury and magnificence. Never did any man de-
erve to well the name of Protezus. Ambition, ·how-
.ever, was his ruling passion; and, in every dispute, he
.arp~ired at superiority with the utmost eagerness. He was,
*,indeed, in all ref~pe ts, in titled to pre-eminence in A-
th~ens; for he poffeff~ed every qualification requisite in a ,
,leading man. His ability in business; his illuffrious de-
kent; the beauty of his person, which was calcu~lated to
procure him the love and admiration of all who saw
him_; his immense riches, which he spent with the most
oiftentations profusion; the pulblic feasts furnished -by
:him to the people; and the high magfnificence in which
hi :e:Iived, dazzled the eyes, and attrafted the refped
~'and confidence of his fellow-citizens. W~hen, to all

holte eadvantages, are added his admirable eloquence,
and his· singular krnowled ge in the art of war, we clearly
fee., that he mult soon become the idol of the people.
.His faukts were overlooked ; those airs of superiority,
which, in this republic, would have been accounted
:criminal in.any other pedion, were exrcufed in him; and
his wild excesse~s were called by the fofter,name of youth-
Inil frolics.

It has been already observed, that he exhibited the

first proofs of his bravery at Potidea. Having been flat-.
tered, on that occasion, with prediftions of his soon
eclipsing the ablest generals of Greece, he conceived a
desire for war; and· becoming jealous of the high repu-
t~ation of Nicias, he exerted his utmnoft: effbrts to pre-
vent the peace concluded by that wife Athenian, be-
tween his countrymen and the Lacedemonians, from
taking effe~t. He laboured underhand to detach ·the
Arg~ives from the Spartan interest, and to exasperate
the Athenians against the Spartans, on account of the-
latter having delivered up the fort of Pana~tus in a ruin-
ous condition, and not fortified as it ought to have been
in terms -of the treaty. He endeavoured, at the fame
time, to render Nicias fulrpe~ted·.

W.~hile' there intrigues were going on,ambaffadors from

Sp~arta, arrived at A~thens. ~Alcibiades, by ftratagemi, or

rather

rather by a piece of unjuffifiaible roguery, provoked the
people to s~uch a degree ag~ainst the ambassadors, that
they difmife~d ~thfem in a very contumelious manner.
The ambaffagdors returned to Sparta, full of indignation
at the in-solent usage they had received at Athens; and
the war- was immediatelyt renewed. The Athenians conl
cluids an allianlce wKith the M~antineans and Eleans, name
Acibiad~es general, and fe-nd an army to ravage Lta.
conIa1.

Nilcias and Alcibiades enjoyed between them all autho-

rity in: Athens. The former had dilguffed the people,
by opposing their unreasonable desires; the latter had
provoked them by his haughty behaviour and d~ifolute
life. Each of~ ther, however,was s~upported by a faition,
and they reciprocally ran the hazard of being banifhedi
by offracifin. For Hryperbolus, a man of a profligate cha-
radter, who poffeffed so~me influence in the republic, used
ever~y art to irritate- the people against them, flattermng
himself with the hope of succeeding to the place and
power of him that should be banished. But Nicias and
Alcibiades uniting their interests, procured the banish-
ment of Hyperbolus. As this punishment of offracifin
had never before been employed, except against persons
of superior merit and diftination, it fell into disuse ever
after this time, on account of Its having been exercised
upon to unworthy a fubjeat.

ALlcibiades, in the mean time, indulged himself, with.

out reserve, in his pleafiures. The luxury and-volopto-
odfnef~s in which he lived, made every virtuous Atheni-
an ashamed. He was engaged in a continual round of
feasting and -deba~ichbery; and the wiser fort became ap·
prehenfive, left by means of his extravagant profusion to
the people, and of the daily shows with which he enter-
·tained them, he thould arrive ~at last: at supreme and ab-
fohtite power, and become their tyrant.

Since the death of Pericles, the Athenians had mafin-

tained a firia alliance with the Leontines in Sicily, who,
on being~ attacked by the Syraculans, had sent an em-
baffy to Athens, at the head of which was the celebirated orator~

orator Gorgias, who pleaded the cause of the Leontines
Siis an oration so elegant and pathetic, that the request of
the ambassadors was comiplied with; and the Athenians
few' a fleet to Rhegiumn to afif~t the Leonltiies. Next
jyear they sent thither a more numerous fleet itill, under
ptet~ence ds affidting the towns oppressed by the Syraceu
fals, but, in fa~t, to open ~to themselves a way to the
conquest of Sicily. Alcibiaqes, by his harangues, in-
Bigated the Athen-ians still more and more to this un-
defitaking, and talked of nothing less than ex~tending the
conquixets of Athens over Africa and Italy.

Whle~ the minds of the At~thenians were full of ther~e

mighty projeats, amnbaffadors arrived from the Egiftians,
to implore their afill~ance against the Selinontines, who
were fapported by the Syracuf'ans ; offering, at the fame
time, to pay the troops that thoruld be f~eat to their as.
f~ifance. The Athenians, tempted by there' promnifes,
inamed Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus, to < ,mmand
a fleet deffined to foccour the Egiftians. Nicias remon-
firated aganint this expedition in the firongeft terms,
and painted out, in the most lively colours, what ruin-
ous consequences might thence result to the republic.
He repref'ented to the Athenians, that they had but too
mhany enemies on their hands already, without going a.
broad to seek for more; and that though they were
hardly beginning to recover from the~ misfortunes occa-
fioned by the late war and plague, they were wantonly
expo~sing: themselves to a greater danger ftilLt

Nicias, in this harangue, likewirfe refl~e~ted indireatly

on the luxury of Alcibiades, who had now carried his
extravagance to an incredible pitch. ~The expence of
the furniture of his honfe, and of his retinue, wais pro-
digious. -His table was as flimptuous as that of any
pi'ince; and he contended at the Olympic games with
fevien different sets of horses. To support to expensive~
a ·life, it was absolutely necessary for him to poffers vast
funds; and Nicias, no doubt, meant to insinuate, that
Ailcibiades expe~ted to have an opportunity, by this ex-~
&editiop, to repair his private fortune, which must have

b3een

been gr~eatly diffipatedd by fixch enormous exepences.-
Alcibiades answered the harangue of Nicias, by telling
the audience, that his magnificence was intended to re-
flecT hopour on his country. He put them in mind of
his services to the comamonwelth. He assured them that
the cities of Sicily were to weary of the oppreiron of
their petty fevereigns, that they would initantly open
their gates to the firfk power which thould appear to de-
liver them from the~ir present slavery ; and he concluded
with telling them, that to carry thezr arms abroad, was
the sourest way to damp the courage of their enemites,
and· that the Athenians muif always conrtinue matters
at sea,· in spite of the Lacedemonians.

The Athenians, delighted with this il~attering speech of

Alcibiades, entirely disregarded that of Nicias, who was
a man of a soft pufll~animous difporfition, and of an
irresolute temper. ' They therefore perfiftedf in their
resolution to undertake this expedition, and began to
m~ake the necessary preparations for it with the utmost

disp~atch. Jat~i as the Athenian fleet was on the point of setting
fail, several evil presages fell out that extremely perplex-
ed~ the moinds of the people. IJ?, Tlhe feast of Adonis
happened at this time, which wnas celebrated by the wo-
men, uttermng piteous groans and lamentations; and it
wsas~ cuffomary for all the inhabitants on that occaflon to
wear mourning. 2dly, The statues of Mercury, one
of which flood before the entry of every hou~se, were all
mraimed in the fame night, and the author of this piece
of sacrilege could not be discovered. The wild libertine
charafter of Alcibiades expos~ed him to suspicions of ha-
vring been concerned in this mischief. But the affe~tion
entertained for him by the soldiers and sailors, who de-
cl~ared~, that they would not proceed ,on the expedition,
if the fmnalleft violence were offered to his person, pre-
served him at present from any troubl~e on that head.

~Alcibi-ades demanded to be tried, that he might have

ane opportunity of justifying himself before his d'epart ure.

But the people, impatient for the expedition prroceedilng,
obliged him to, set faBil. The view of the flees under
fails attr~aied the admiratiori bothi of the citiicens iriabd of
fkran~g~ers; for never had a single city in the wefltern
io~rld displayed to grand and miagni~ficent an -armament''
It ~odifiied of x36 veifels, carirymrg6280 soldiers, of
whioin the grealter part were heavy armed. Bdfides
f'lidf~ie, thiere were 3 o vessels loaded with provifibiss; anda
d~ie whole was attended by I00 ibarkis, witliouth i-
cid:;'in~g merchant thips, or the after augmentations of
tlif.fl'eet. Besides thie sea forces, there 'was a'-bodiy of
fr~ools for the Pand service, and among th~ese a few ca-
vdalry; -All ·the forces were equi'jped in the snoft com-
ptlete manner : and, upoix the woho~le there could hardly
be a ·grander or more beautifu~l exhibi~tion.

';When the troops were embarked, the whole
fleet, on a 'fignal given by a trumpet, weighed 45
anithbor, attenided with a general thout of th~e
fjie~tators, pourinig out their most earnest vows for ·the
Ac~cess of their fellfow-citizens. The fleet: dire~td ~its
-coniffe towards Rhegiurni, whither they dispatched som~e
flips~ before the re~f, to fee that the monley promi-sed by~
the Egeftians dras rea~dy; of ~which, however, ttiey foundci
no more than thirty talents provilded. Nicias availedc
himnfelf of this circumstance, to enforce the r~easons he
had intified on againit the expedition, and advise~d to
t~rininate the dis~pute between the Egeftians and Seli-
xiontinein in anl amicable mann~er; to oblige the former
to itfulfi th~eir ezigagements; and then to returnl to A-
thiens. AlPcibiades, on the contrary, sa~id it would jbe
disgraceful to return withouti performing so~me fignal'
erploit with so powerful an armament; that they oug~ht
t-o endeavour to detach the Greekrs in Sicily from the~ir
conneftion with Syracuife, to bring them over to their
own party, and, after obtaining from them reinforce -
tinents both of troops and provisions, to attack Syra~cure
Lamachus advised to march immediately against Syra-
clifLe. But thle opinion of Alcibiades prevailed. They

th ere -

therefore, continued their co~urse for Sicily, where Alci.
biades reduced Catana ".

Let us now look back to Athens. The enemies of

Alcibiades, intent alone on gratifying their re~fentments.
without regarding the public interest, tookr advantage
of his absence to renew against him an accusation of
having in a debauch` profaned the mysteries of Proser-
pine anrd Ceres ; and they profecutied the accusation
with the most inveterate malice and animosity. Many-
persons we~re accused-, and thrown into prison, without
being evien permirtted to be heard ; ard a veifel was dif,
patched to bring Alcibiades to Rtand trial before the
people. To this he apparently confemced, and went on
board of the galley; but ori arriving at Thuritum he dif.
appeared. Not having th~erefore obeyed the summons
w~ithin the limited time, he was condemrned to death
for comtumacy, and his effeats were confiscated.

Nicias finding himself, bty the absence of Alcib~iades,

invefied with the foble command, managed matters in
that flrow irresolute manner that was natural to himl
waiting the ardour of the army in fatiguing, infignifi.
cant marches along the coasts ; and at last he retired to
Catana,, without performing any greater exfplorit thad
ruining a small village.

Alcibiades arriving at Argos, applied to the Spafa

tans for permifi~on to live in their cityi and under their
prote~tion,· making theml in return an offer of his best
services. The Spartans, overjoyed to have in their
power to able a general of their enemy, received him
with the highest: marks of good will and efkeem. Here
by the singular faculty he pof~feffed of accommodating
himself to the way of life of every country in which he
had occasion to live, he imitated, with- the greatest eas~e,
the Spartan temperance and austerity, and, by that
means, quickly gained their sincere affe~t~ion.

The Syracuf~ans, in the mean time, made vigorous

preparations for an obitinate defence, and began to upi

Nib~cias., stung with there reproaches, resolved at Jaft to·
attack Syracut~e by sea and land.
- As this siege of Syracuse is one, of the most remark-
able recorded in hiffory, it is proper, in a very few
wocrdis, to give: some· idea of the iituation of that city.
IA was originallyv founded by Archias the Corinthian, ·on-
ths,eaftern coast of Sicily. It had a greater and leifer
Barzolur; the circuroference of the gr~eater be~ing about-
fir asiles. The town itself was one of the meft beauti-
foll and powerful poffef~fed by the Greeks; and codifiied
of three. principal divisions: 1/1, The iiland, called
Ortygia, which -was f~eprated from the main land by a
masrrow arm of the f~iea. This quarter was every where
itronglyT fortified in the afhion of thofre times, and
might therefore be regarded as the citadel of Syracnfe.
Tie~ ad diviiion iAcra~dina flood on. the main land nearetii
t~d th~e little firait that bounded O-rtygia, with which it

communicated by abridge thrown over that ~trait. This
forated the bodyof the city. 'Tyche, the Zd great diviiion,
a~djoinddc to Acradina on the Land filde ; and a mafls of
buildling or fortification, named EFlexopilusr, comnmanded
the access to Ty-che. Beyond and contiguous to Hexai
pit~us~was the large fanburb of Epipolis, fituatfed for~the
greater part on a sleep eininence. The whole united
formied perhaps one of the molt extensive cities at that
taiat in the world.

The first ne~ws of the arrival of the At~henian ·fleet- in

Sicily produced the great~est conifernation among the
Sypracufans, who immediately applied themselves, with
the utmnoft diligence, to make the nceffary preparations
fo~r re~peling the attack of the enemy. The backward-
mess of Nicias -contributed not a little to revive the
couzrage of the Syracnfans ; a party: of who-se horse
approached to the very ikirts of the Athenian camp.
Nic~ias, not daring to disembark his troops in the face
of an enemy prepared to receive them, procured sa~fe
inielligence to be conveyed to the Syracufans, who in

I[ CO1R-

conifeq~uence thereof hoping to su~rprise his camp, march-
ed all their forces -toward's Catanav Bu~t Niciai in
the mean time, reimbarked his men, and failing towards
the· ne-ighbourhooid ·of Syracuse, effected a landing at
Olympia, and there pitched his camp.

SThe Syracufan troops finding themselves deceived,

returned :to Syracnf~e, and drew thems~elves up in battle
order be-fore ~the walls of the city. Nicias did not de-
cline :the -combat, which proved long and obitinate.
The Syracufans, however, were at last~ obliged to give
gro~und,· and under cover of their cavalry to retreat
into the. city. The Athenians being too weak to attack
the city, failed back to Catana, where they took up
their winter-quarters, :intending to return to Syracut~e
n -the spring. Butl being in. want both of money and
provisions, they sent to Athens for both. The Syracu.
fins, in the mean time, acquiring freth courage, chose
for their general' Hermocrates, a man of diftinguiihed
bravery, and- very flkilful in the art of war. _By his
advice, -they difrpatchelct ambaff~ado~s· to. Corinth and
Sparta :to renew their former alliances, and to beg al.
fiftance; which accordingly they obtained. Alcibiabes,
who viras then at Sparta, meditating -vengeance against
his ungrateful counitrymen, supported the request of the
Syracufans, and perfunaded the Lacedemnonians to fend
Gylippus as general into Sicily, and, at the fame time,
to make a diver sion to the Athenian arms, by attacking
them in Attica.'

The- Syracufans, in the mean· time, were diligently

fortifying their city,. They rgir~ed a wall along one fide
of the fii burb of Epipolis, and getting intelligence that
the Atheniians wer-e at: Naxus, ordered their army to
march and burn the Athsenian camp at Catana.

Nicias having received 300 talents, and a reiziforce-

ment of some troops of horse, advanced towards Sy~ra-
curje. Thoughi this~ general was very floi in entering
upon afion, yet when once in motion, he proceeded
with much spirit and diligence. Sailing from Catana,
he .arrived within less than a mile ·of Epipolis; and

4 h- baving

hiaving there landed his forces, he retired with the fleet
towards Thapsus, a part of Syracut~e that forms a pe-
ninf~ula, of which' he that up the entry. A body of
Syracuans·, to the number of 7oo men, h aving attack-
ed the Athenians, were repulsed, after losing 3oo of
their number on the s~pot. The viators cre&ed a trophy,
and formed the design of throwing up a fortification on
the h~igheift part of the Epipolis. Nicias, at the fame
time, received a reinforcement of S oo horse from the
Egeftains,- which, joined to ago lately sent him from
Athens, and~ the few he had b'efore, for~med, altogether,
a body of 65 o cavalry.

Encouraged by this afif~tance, he raif'ed a line of car-

cumvallation on the Tyche fide, to that up the city all
the way from Tyche to the sea on the north. This
work advanced very briskly, in [pite of repeated attacks
made by the Syracufarns, in one of which their cavalry
was routed. The Syracufans, on the other hand, be-
gan to credt a fortification that might prevent the Athe-
nians from carrying on their line of circumvailation.
But the Athenians attacked those who guarded it, pur.
fEed them into the city, and then destroyed the fortifi-
catioil. Having completed the line along the north fide,
the Athenians proceeded to confiruat another that
might completely that up the city. The Syracuifans, to
prevent their exrtending this second wall to the s~ea-side,·
threw up a ditch across a marth,- and lined it with pali-
fadoes a but the Athenians descending suddenly from E-
pipolis, filled up the ditch. On: this occasion they had
an engagement witth the SyracufCans, in which they were
at frirft ucce~fsful; but in attempting to cut off the
flight of the enemy, their right wing was charged by
the Syracufan cavalry, and thrown into disorder ; and -
Lamachus advancing to its assistance with the Argive
audiliaries, was killed. The Syracufans, animated by
this advantage, determined to attack the Athenian fort
on Epipolis. But Nicias, though then sick, saved it by
a firatagem; giving orders to set the wood between the

In the mean time, the. Athe~nian fleet, which lay is

anchor at T'hapfus, having received ord~er~s to come be-
fbre the city, entered the large harbour, and obliged
the S~yriacuf~ans to that themselves up within the walls.
'I'he A~thenians, not satisfied- with their fortifications on
the top of O'pipolis, threw up two walls at the bottom
of it, 00; for a de~fence againlit the Syracufans within
the city, and the other against their army, which was
encamped withput the walls. WThen all these workrs
were completed, Nicias entertained the most sanguine
hopes of, taking Syracuse; and his cexpeftations were
confirtmed on his being joined by several of the slates of
Sicily, a~ndi receiving a fresh Aupply of provisions. The
Syracufans now looked upon themselves as loft; and a
rumour prevailed that the Athenians were become ma-
fiers of the whole island. B~ut the arrival of Gylippus
with, succours from Lacedemo~n, gave a new turn to
St~heir affairs.

Nicias, from too great a. confidence in his own,

ithength, was not at all alarmed, at his arrival, nor took
any trouble to oppose his landing. The event, how.
ever, was dec~isive ; for Sy~racute was capable of making
no further resistance, and its citizens were consulting
about the articles of capitulation, when they received

notice, that G~ylippus was come to their afif~tance

4·'4. with fLeveral galleys. They immediately sent out

a body of troops~to. cover his landingS; which was

no sooner effe~ted, than they advanced in order of
barttle towards Epipolis. The Athenia~ns, though tabae
oppriepared, made difpoitzions for fighting; but, a
their confutiion, Gylippos attacked the fortification on
the-top .of Epipolis, and carried it by assault.

Nicias's whole hope being now confined to his naval.

force, he thought it necessary to fortify the promontory
of Plem~myrus, which narrows the entrance into the
great harbour, and for that purpose ere~ted on it three-
.diffierent forts. But a large detachment of his soldiers

Atheneians. He was beatext in the first engagement,
ichiefly· on account of the narrowrrefs of his. ground.
B~ut having next: day drawn up. his men on- a more esx-

Nicias finding his troops diminiihing every day, wrote

to Atth-ns· a very-pr~effing letter, in which he patheti-
cattydeferibed the ruinous condition of his galleys, and
the alarming dccrea~fe both of his sailors and soldiers by·
m1ortalitY~ and by the ufiual operations of war, the latter
chiefly occasioned by the s~uperiorit~y of: the enemy's,
cavfaliys. He likeewife inforraed his countrymen, that:

country, and fortified Decelia, an important post, with-
in eighteen miles of Athens, whence they commanded
the whole country, and prevented the Athenians from
wmorking their silver mines, or deriving any advarnage
from their lands, which they durit not labour. To add
itill further to the distress of the Athenians, they were
obliged to watch day and night, being kept in a conti-
nual alarm by the daily incursions of the enemy. Bel
sides, as all proviflons, before arriving at the city, were
brought a great way about, they became very dear;
and many of their slaves deserted to the enemy for
want of food. Money, too,. was very fearce, neither
their mines nor lands yielding them any thing. On
the whole, the Athenians found thentfelves in a moflt
diffrtefsful situation.

To return to Syracuse. Gylippus having raised in Si-

cily a great number of recruits for their army, perfunded
the Syracufans to exert all their resources in the equip-
ment of a powerful fleet, that they might be able to
attack their enemies both by sea and land. In a very
little time 80 Syracufan galleys appearing offPlemmyrus,
the Athenians got on board of their fleet, and failed
against: the enemy. A very obstinate engagement en-
sued, which however· was not· decisive for either party.
But Gylippus, in the mean time, attackred the forts on
Plemmyrus, and carried themn by assault, after killing
many Athenian soldiers, and taking several prisoners.
In there forts Gylippus found· a good deal of money and
ammunition, with the furniture of a great number of
galleys; and by putting the Syarcufans in poffeffi~on of
that important post, he rendered it ·digicult for Nicias
to receive any convoysr The Athenians, therefore,
were seized with great .confiernation.

But this success of the Syracufans receiv~ed about this

time a considerable check. For their thips having fallen
foul of one another at the entrance of the lesser bar,
bour, the Athenians attacked them, funk Ia of them,
and dispersed the reft. In memory of this vi~tory the
Athenians creticd a trophy on a small island. S everal

Several other infignificalnt engagements, which it

would be tedious to recount, happened between the
two parties. The Syracufans, howeirer, considering that
it would be prudent for them to hazard another battle
before the arrival of the reinforcements expedted by the
enemy from Athens, began to prepare themselves for it
with all possible diligence. Nicias, on the contrary, fen-
fible how dangerous it was to venture another engage-
ment, his men being so much diminished in point of
numbers, and exhauffed with fatigue, resolved to decline
fighting till the expeded afif~tance thould arrive. But
IVenander and Euthydemus, a~tuated by jealoury against
Nicias, maintained, that the honour and reputation of
Aithens would fuffer by their declining-the combat ; and
they insisted with fisch obstinacy on his giving battle,
that N~Picias was forced to comply.

T'he fleets at first only engaged in fmnall fkrirmifhes.

But towards the end of the third day, the Syracufans,
after making a feint of retiring, as they had done th'e
two preceding days, turned suddenly: upon the Athe-
nians, who being thus taken unawares, and not ha-
ving time to form, were obliged to fly, after losing seven
galleys, and a great number of soldiers. The miserable
situation to which Nicias saw his affairs now red uced by
fuffering hims~elf to be over-ruled by hi's colleagues,
threw ·him into despair.

The day a~fter the battle, the expeated Athenian fleet,

consisting of 7 3 galleys, commanded by D~emoithenes,
all richly ornamented, and carrying about 8000 soldiers,
came in Fight, and advanced with an air of triumph.
The SyracufaBns were confounded at their appearance,
believing the resources of the Athenians to be inexhault-
ible, and that they were to be exposed to greater cala.
annies than ever.

D~emofithenes resolved to avail himlfelf of the conifer-

nation into which his arrival had thrown the Syracufans,
flattering hims~elf with the perfuation of taking the city
at once. But his design was rath. Nicias repref~entedl
to him in vain, that the Syracufans being reduced to

-the last -extkrerity ·for -wa1n~t of money aznd provi~sions
would vrerly soon surrender ; wohich he k~ne certain~ly by
the information of .fomne ~persons within the town, who
advised him to wait patiently a lItde longer. But as he
:did ~not choose to ·menticon thofes from whom he received
this intedlige-nce, his remnom~ftrances were disregard~ed;5
for not only DTemofithenes and the other comnmand~ers
but even the inferior oficers, believed this opinion of
N~icias to be entirely f~uggefied by ser. D)emolthenes
even proqceeded to ulpbraid his b~ack w~ardnefs ; his re-
proaches were applauded by the reit, and all djifcovered
the utmost impat'ience for fig~hting.

Demosthenes immediately ~resolved to attackr Epipolis.

H-aving led thither all his forces at nilght, he himself be-
gan the attack of the entrenchments, kiialld those who
guarded them, and at the fame time repulsed the troops
~that had sallied out upon him fromP the city. The A.
thenians, animated: by their success, hurry o~rwa~rd in
difiorder, and bear down every thing that opposes them.
But the Bee~otian troops\ unexpe~tedly flop their career,
and, attacking them with levelled spears, put them to
flight, and make a great ilaolght-er. T he w~hole army is
seized with a panic, which is increased by the darkness
of the night. Some in their flight fall from the tops of
the rocks, an~d are dashed in pieces; ot~hers wan~der into
the country, and are either killed or taken -by the Syra-
.cufan horse. Upon t~his occa~fron the Athenians are
said to have loft upwards of 200~0 men.

T'his grievous disaster entirely discouraged the Athe-

nians; whole number, too, wcas continually dim~inish-
ing by the diseases that prevailed inathe army, occasion-
ed by the un w~holefomne vapours of a mnorals near to
w~hich the army wav~s encamnped. Demosthenes there·
fore advised to raise the Gfiee immediately. But Nicias,
though of the fame opinion, thought an abrupt de-
~parture would but expose their weraknefs too much;
and that, at any rate, they o~ught t-o wait for orders
·from A~tens. On this point Demosthenes was obliged
to fuabmit to his colicague. B3ut Gylip~pus having, Gi

the

'the inean~ time, brought a fresh ihpply of troopijs to the
aid of the ·Syr-acufans, the .apprehenfious of t~he Athe-
hzians were Tso much increased, that they resolved to de-
par't imnmediately.

T~he Syraculans getting notice of this reso~lutio~n, pre-

pared to attack them by sea and land. They fell first
upon their chtrenchments, which they carried, ;and
then their g~alleys failed agai~nst those~ of the Athe~nians.
Eurymedon having feparsted himself from the reft of
the fleet~, with an i~ntenti~on to surround- the~ Syracufans,
was pu'rfued by them to the bottom of the gul'f, defeat-
ed, and killed, and the galleys under his command weris
-drivten on Thiore. But Gylippus having attacked the Aso
ithehnian soldiers as they were mak~ing their es~cape out
of ~the galleys to the land, was repul'fed with ·lo;Ss. 'In
the Irean timre, however, the Syracufans took poCffbiiork
of I 8 of those galleys, a~fter cutting off their crews.

This bhlow threw the Atheni-ans into the deepeit de-

jediani. The Syracufans, on the other hand, promised
the~mselves a complete co~nqtzeft ove~r their enemies ; and
bi-gan to devise new o~bstacles to their departure ; for
irh~ichJ purpose they ihut up the mouth of the great hars-
~ibu'r diith ·iron chains. The Athenians finding thern-
thrtes thus hemmed in, and fkraitened for provi-sions,
r~esolved to hazard another fea-figh~t. With this view

ic~iajs embaLrked the flower of his foot soldiers on board
of nor ~galleys, and drew up the reft of his troops along

The generals on both sides, after using the most

p~bvvrful arguments to encourage their men, led them
'on to the engagement, which proved extremnely bloody.
TJhe At~henians ·advancing to the mouth of the harbout*
to break the chains, and the Syracufans likewise hurry-
ing th-ither to prevent them, the galleys were to crowded
together, that they colild neither move backrwards nor
forwards, nor fight in any fort of order, and the battle
grewl exrtremnely furious. Naothing was to be seen but
thre ruiins of thips, and numbers of dead bodies. The
~~t;Oar~1 and confusion was so great, that the: orders of:

O 4 tbo~

the commanders could no more be heard. The Athe-
nians still endeavoured to break the chain, and their
enemies to defend it.' At last, however, after a very
long and oblkinate contest, the Athenian fleet was driven
on shore by the enemy, and viffory declared in favour
of the Syracufans.

The unfortunate Athenians, not daring to attempt

the passage a s~econd time, had now no other resource
left, than to retreat in the night by land, and to aban-
don their fleet to the enemy. Harmlocrates guessed their
·design, and procured false intelligence to be conveyed
to Nicias, of the enemy having seized the passes. The
.Athenians, therefore, inficad of setting out in the night,
delayed their march till the second day after ; 10 that in
the interval the Syracufans had time really to possess
themselves of the most difficult passes, to break down
the bridges, and to post their cavalry along the plain.

The departure of the Athrenians exrhibited one of the

most melancholy s~cenes that can well be imagined;
being obliged to leave behind them their sick and
wounded, who conjured them by every tegder name to
carry them with them, and called on the gods to wit-
ness the cruelty of their fellow-foldiers. Terror appear-
ed in every countenance. Nicias, though worn out
with sickness, and deprived of common necessa~ries, ex-
erted his utmost efforts to keep up their drooping spirits;
telling them, that they were still formidable by their
numbers, and that fortune mu It at last cease to pers~ecute
them.

The army was disposed in two different columns;

and the retreat was at first condu~ted with pretty good
order. But being able to discover no free passa~ge, the
troops were continually galled by the Syraculan cavalry.
Their proviflons failing in the mean time, they altered
their plan, and resolved to march in the night. This
expedient proved fatal to theml. For one; half of the
rear guard, with D~emosthenes at their head, having
loft th~eir way in the dark, were next day overtaken by
the Syraculans, who surrounded and attacked them i~n

a narrow defile. The Athbenians, however, defended
dreafelves with the most desperate bravery, till, ex-
banrited with hunger and~ fatigue, they were at length
corrpelled to surrender at diferetion, together with De-
mofthe-nes their commander, though amounting itill to
about 6000 men.

Nicas, after paSsing a river, and encamping on a ri.

sing ground, was like wife overtaken by the enemy, who
ordered him to lay down his arms. in this situation he
offered to deliver them hostages, as a fec'urity for his re-
paying them all the exrpences they had incurred by the
war, provided they would permit him and his men to
depart from Sicily. The SyraLcufans rejeafed his propo-
fals, and immediately attacked his troops, who still de-
fended theinfelves with great bravery. Arriving at last
at the river Afilnarus,, his fosldiers, half dead with thirit,
greedily plunged into it to drink. But the Syracufans
immediately renewing the attack, entered the river a-
long with the Athenians, and cut them off while quench-
ing their thirit. Nicias feeing this slaughter, agreed to
surrender himself to Grylippus, if he would spare
the reft of his m-en. They were accordingly all 4 I g
taken -prifonrers, and conadu~ted into the city in
triumph .

Next day the Syracufans deliberated about the fate of
the prisoners, and their two commanders. Diocles advised
to confine the other prisoners in the public prisons, and to
put the two generals to death. This last article thocked
the wiser part of the citizens extremely ; and one of
them, named Nicholaurs, a venerable old man, mount-
mng the frpeaker's place, pronounced a most pathetic
and Sensible speech, telling his countrymen, that such a
gross a&R of inhumanity must make thernu abhorred and
detefied by all nations, more especially as the gods had
already fufficiently punished the Athenians. This speech,
wrhich was enforced by many other powerful arguments,
made a great impreilion upon the citizens, who s~eemed
to be mercifully disposed, till some of them who were
more exasperated than the reet against the Athenians by

the

feri'ted in the firongeft -colours the nurnb~eilers~l mifedte'

rnxanders; who were execruted a'ccordingly. The tragical
fate of those two unappy gerierals was co~mrniferated by
everty moderate person, particularly ~that of Nicias, who
had always opposed this fatal exrpedition. The reRi of
the prisoners were confined itr the 'public prisons, wterre
the~y undlerwe'nt the cruelletlt hardl~hips, re~e~ving every
dayr a v-ery firnall id-lowanrci of onlrY meal axd wat~er ~for

play-ed i2n plotting mnifth~ief against h~is countr-ymen, in
revenge los theiur ujuft treatment ;of thin ; and wvith that
view he had mrade a journey to Chi~os, and ·had ~prevailedl
on leveral cities of lo~nia to revolt. Nothbing w~vas done
in Sparta but b·y ;thre ;interposit~ion of Al~c~ibiades . Bu~~t
his exrorbiitant power in that city at last ·drew upon hisix
the jealousy of its king Agis, and the principal Srpartanus,
wvho Idev~ifed a p3Lan for the defi~rcuion ~of so atitRive air

rdvlerfa-ry. ~Alcibiabes, informed of his danger, fled to Sardis,
and aut, himnfelf unde~r th~e pro~teaion of Tiflh~ph er~nes.,
Hfs engaging manners, and the cha~rms of lhis conve~rfa-
nion, soon pro~cured him the frie-ndfip of that satrap,
~who, ~though ofad haughty fierce difpolition, and a bar-
banian, freely communicated all his secrets to Alcibia-
dies. But of what value are wit, bravery, and the finledt
extenior accornpitihments, when they cover a bad heart ?
Ailcibsiades, on this occasion, thowed himself to be a
man ·of no principle, and void of all affei~cton for his
counft~ry. He advis~ed: Tiffaphernes to k~eep, up the ani-
mofity b~etween Athens and Sparta, and to afflit there
agafint each other, that they mright exhault their re-
sources in their mutual deffru~ion, and so become itz
the·endl an easy· prey to the Pertian monarch. Tiffa--
pheirees adopted his plan ; and from that time forwrard,
thre Persians, who durfit not ·now attack the Greeks
with open force, employed their money and influence to
doinent quarrels among ~the diffkeret states ; sendi~ng ~con-
iiderabe sums Fomnetimes to Athens, someti~mes to Spar-

a~~~s te eleceilities of each required, to kreep the ba-

lance

lance even between the two, and to enable them to ruin
each other.

The Athenians hearing of the great credit ofAlcibia-

des at the court of Tiffaphernes, ·repented heartily of
their hadih usage of him. For though by means ·of their
fleet they had lately been able to reduce thre revolted
islands to obedience, yet they entertained firong appre.
benflons of Tiffaphernes', who was f'oon to receive I5o
vessels from Phenicia. Alcibiades being no firanger to
their sentiments with refped to himself, had it privately
hinted to them, that he was desirous to return to Athens,
and would procure them the friendship and affifance of
Tiifaphernes, provided they would abolish the popular
form of government, and establish aristocracy. This met
with great opposition at firit, particularly from the ene.
mies of Alcibiades. But as there appeared no other
me'ans of s~aving the republic from utter ruin, the people
at last codfented, though much against their inclination.-

Pifander, accordingly, with ten other deputies, were

appointed to treat with Alcibiades and T~Iiffaphernes.
But the latter, apprehensive of rendering the Athe-
nians too powerful, and chooting rather to adhere to
the plan laid down by Alcibiades of fomenting the wRar
between the two republics, insisted upon it as a prelimi-
nary condition, that the Athenians should relinquiih all
their poffeffions in lonia; and made other demands of
iach an extravagant nature, that the deputies broke off
the treaty in disg~ust, convinced that Alcibiades had
only meant to make them ridiculous. Tiffaphernes, at
the fame time, concluded an alliance with the Pelopon-
nefians, by which he agreed, on their ceding all their
provinces in Asia in favour of his master the king of
Persia, to defray the expence of the Lacedemonian fleet,
till the arrival of that of the Persians. Thes~e tranfac·
tions happened in the eleventh year of the reign of Da-
rius Nothus.

At Athens but too much deference was paid to the

opinion of Alcibiades. In consequence of his advice, the
popular government was abolished, and ariffocracy fe'

.p in its place. The whole magiffracy was thrown into
the hands of 4oo persons, who were invefied with abfo-
late power. There new rulers soon discovered their
tyrannical dif~polition. Entering the senate armed with
poniards, and furrrounded with guards, they dissolved it,
after paying the 500 members of it the s~alaries due to
them. 'Their adminiffration was othered in with fen-
tences of banithment, profecriptions, and poifonings of
those -from whom they expefied opposition. But tkhisi
violent behaviour quickly exasperated all the citizensp
against them; and the army which was then lying at Sa-
mos, bearing of their proceedings, was to highly eara-
ged, that they reduced su~ch of their officers as they A~tf-
pelted to be conne~t~ed with the aristocracy, appointed
Thrafylus and Thrafylbulus in their flead, and anx9ioully
intreated Alcibiades to take the chief c'ommand.

Alcibiades obeyed ; and putting himself at the head
of the Athenian forces, proceeded to ~Miletus, to pre-
sent himself in his new dignity before Tiffaphernes, and
to thew the~ satrap, that the power of his countrymen
wras Hill formidable. Returning to Samos, he found
there messengers from the 4oo waiting for -him. But
the soldiers would not even deign to hear them, insist-
ing to be instantly led against the tyrants. Alcibiades,
however, considering, th~at by departing with the army
from Samos, he thould leave lonia exrpofed in a de-
fenceless Situation to the attempts of the enemy, and
fearing, besides, left his appearance at Athens might be
produffive of a civil war, in which his countrymen
wRould exhault their firength against each other, refused
to comply with the request of the foldiers'; but at the
fame time he declared it to be his opinion, that it was ne-
ceLary to abolish aristocracy, and to reffore the s~enate.

The fleet which Tiffaphernes had promis~ed to fend to
the afift~ance of the Peloponnefians, arriving in the
mean time at Afpendos in Pamphylia, Alcibiades failed
to oppose its proceeding any further. But the Lacede-
momians having defeated the fleet sent by the 4oo to the
relief of Eubcea, and having taken poffefiron of that

island,

f-erna~tion, as Euboea- furnished he~m· ~ith. the greater
part of their proviflons. Had the: Laced~emonians pro
·sited·, as they ought to have done, by the confusion
producetd by this event at AtPhens, and ad~vanced- with
their: vic~orious ~fleet agfairdt: that city, the fate of the A-.
thenian republic might in all probsability have been die-
termined. Riut the flowners with which the Laedemo.
n-ians conldua·ed 'all their ent~erprifies, gave time to the
Athenians· to put themselves in a proper po~ture of de-
fencea. They immediately recalled· Alcib~iades, deprived
the- 400 of their authorityi and fitted out a-nother ·fleet,
of which they gave the command to The~naf~ylus and Thra.
~fybUlus. TherTe commanders accordingly set fail, and
falling in- with the enemy's fleet on the coait of the H~eli
lefp~ont, totally defeated it.

SA~lci-biades, naturally fond of gloryt, and defrous of
performing .som~e exploit, before returning to Athens,
that might render his; arrival more welcome to his coun-
trymen, cru~izedl with hi~s fleet abou~t the ifi~ands of Cos
can~d· Unidus; and- getting intelligence thfat· the other A-
thenian fleet was on the point of coming to,a second en-
gagement with that of the Pelopounefians near Abydos,
he hurried to the affifiance of the former, and arrived~
just· as they were beginning the battle. He immed~iately
falls on the enemy with eighteen thips, takes thirty o
theirs, defiroyxs many of the remainder, makes a g~reat
floughter of their soldiers while endeavouring; to save
themfeilves by swimming, and ereats a trophy. Proud:
of his success, he resolves to appear once more before
Tiff~aphernes in all the glory of a conqueror. But the
fa trap, apprehensive: left the La-cedemonians thoul~d com-
plain of his conduA to the Persian monarch, ord~ered
A~lcibiades to be apprehended and conveyed to Sardis,
informing him at the fame time, that he had received
orders from his master to make war on the Athemians.
Alci-biades, however, found means to es~cape from his
confinement, and to get on board of· the Athrenian fleet,
where he was q~uickly joined by Theramenes, with

twenty

tweasy ships.; and soon after by T~hrarybulus, with;
twenty mnose. Finding himself now at the headi of: a
powerful fleet, of no fewer than eighty vessels, he re·-
solved to proceed to. Cizicus to. attack M-i~ndar~us, Eom.
mantdeE of th~·ef eoponnefian fleet, and Pharnabazus,
whal ha~d jointed him: there. A heavy shower. of rain,
attended with thunder, concealedl his approach from -thel
commy.r As soon as it was fair, he s~uddenly advanceda
to~the Lta~tta with forty thips. The enemy, derpilmg,
the finall· unubert of his. vessels, began the- engagement
wbitlagreat bravery; but on feeing the reflt of his. fleet
aoone. up, they were seized- with a pan-ic, and fled.
AcibPiades. avaiing; himself of their confuls~on, landc~i
his troops, charged thbofe· of Pharnabaseus, put: them to
flight, and killed Mindarus with his own hand, Jg ·,

Ini Akttica, T~hrafylu~s fell upon. the rear guard otP t~

Spartan army, which had been led uI1p to the 7walk~~~ -
Athsens. -y· their king Agis, and- defeated them., Then9
he failed; to Samos. with fifty thiips; and having taken
Colohon, advJan~ced to Ephefiss. But being. repulsed~
by Tiff~aphernes, he returned on. board of his sket, and
fixtecepted four· Syracufan vessels. About the fa-me
tlrie~a battle happened between Tiffapher~nes and Alci.
biades, in. which the former was defeated.

By, the~e· exploits, Alcibiades, rendered the Athenians
maftsers of the Hellespont. The Lacedemonians, in-
formed. of this, feat ambassadors to Athens with pro-
pafals; of peace. The wiser part: of the citizens advife~dt
their~countrymen to embrace this opportunity-of ma-
hing~peace; which, in the present post~ure- of their as-
fanrs, must be greatly to their advantage. But this was-
necenly opposed by. those who~e interest it was to lontinu~e
th~e..ar.

SIn the nest~ calmpaign, Alcibiades, whom fanccefs con-
Itantly attended, resolved to add Chalcedon to his; cona-
quests, EIe accordingly laid siege to that town, and
O`iged. the Bythinians to deliver to him: the provilions
t eintended for the Chalcedonians. The inhabitants-
~tempted ar fallly, but were repulsed, and obliged, in

3 [pite

spite of the approach of Pharnabazus to their relie~f,I to
surrender the town. The At~henians afterwards tookr
~several other places.

After so many exploits, Alcibiades desired to expe.

rience the gratitude of his country ; and for that pur.
pose set fail for Pyreus. The day of his arrival there
was the most glorious of his life. All the people of A-
thens went out to meet him, and condufted him in tri-
umph to the city. His fleet was loaded and ornamented
with the spoils of the enemy ; was attended by a great
number of the thips they had taken; and displayed, in

triumph, the colours of those they had funk and

4roy.· destroyed. He landed, amidit repeated thouts

of his fellow-citizens, who thronged about him to

welcome him home, regarding him as a fort of tutelar
deity, who had brought them back viatory in his train.
They gazed upon him therefore with admiration, re-
fle~ting on the miserable situation of the republic when
he undertook its defence ; and the many important s~er-·
vices performed by him, by which he had rendered her
triumphant both at s~ea and land.

Then Alcibiades alffembling the people, proceeded

to justify himself from the crime laid to his charge,
and imputed all his misfortunes to his bad fortune. The
Athenians, charmed with his eloquence, decreed him a
crown of gold; and by way of reparation of the ill
afage formerly received by him, they reitored to him his
estate, and named him chief commander by sea and
land. The populace, too, always prone to fall into ex-
tremes, began to talk of beffowing on him fotrereign au-
thority. ~But the principal citizens, to~ prevent the es-
feais of their folly, caused a fleet to be equipped with
all pofirble diligence, and urged his departure. Alai-
biades, before setting out, resolved to celebrate the
Ele~usinian ·mysteries.

The Athenians had been long obliged to conduat

this procedian by sea, because the Lacedemonians had
poffeiion of thei roadS leading to Eleusis. But Alcibi*
ades resolved to have it performed in the 'dual manner;

., and

.thtd for that purpose potted troops alorng both sides of
gas way, read~y to r~epulse any attack of the enemy.
Thus piroteting t~he prielts and, the initiaLted withi his
so~ldier~s, jh conduaed the: procefiron - in great orderi
arid ~foleznnity all the way to Eleuff=-, arid back again,
without any accide~nt. By this he intended to wipe
out tie fl~fpicionls of irrelig~ion formerlyi entertained
against him. The affeaion entertained for him by
the A~thenians was t~o mnuch increased by this a~tion,
thait they' wiould hiavte cheerfully made himi king. But
the prihdip~il citizens~, not choosing to give Alcibiiades
tinie to explain himnfelf on that head, haftenied his de~-
parturie, granting him every thing he defiredi Accor;
dingly, he at last set fail towards Ahndros with a fleet
olf Ib so tiPS.

The Lacedemonians, alannied at the hate Cuc~effes of

the Athcenians, thought it neceffaty to oppose one of
their best generals to A~lcibiades, and therefore rele~ed
Lrfa~nder 6hief commander of their fleet. Lysander,
AilthoUgh of noble birth, being lineally descended fiom the
IReraclidde, ws nevertheless educated~ with all the rigoui:
and s~everity of the Spartan dis~cipline. He was brave,
sifthd, dnd in~sinuating ; and to his ruling afjjfliots, ama
btid~on, coauld fatcrifice every other pleafoure or confidi.
tition whatever.

APbput this time Darius,· the Persian mionaricih, had

iappointed the youingeft o~f his sons, Cyrus, to be gover;5
hor of Sardis ; and had advised him, on setting out for
his. government, to ftupport the Lacedemonians in all
,events, in opposition to the Athenians. This was very
difikerent from the policy of Tiffaphernes, and the other
Pi~fian governors; who, as we have seen before, mades
it exi inv~~ariable rule, to hold the balance even between
hiofe 2\two Rtates, and by ·assisting them alternately, as
their refpeative neceirties r~equired, to enable them to
othri~ oult their mutual deftru~tion.
Lyfanlder soon put to feaJ and direaed his course to

Sardis-j where, by means of his Aupple insinuating--
behaiviour, he- soon .pushed himself into favour with

a 'PCyrus,8

Cyrus, to whom he complained of the -partiality of
~Tiffa-phernes to the Aithenians. Cyrus told him, that
he haid orders from the k~ing his father to aifti the La-
cedemonians; and, for that purpose, had received from
him 500 talents of il~ver. Lysander then pers~uaded him
to augment the pay of the frailors to four oboli a day,
and to order all the arrears due them to be immediate.
ly paid up. This augmentation of pay greatly contri.
·buted to weaken the Athenian fleet. For their sailors,
tempted by the high pay, deserted to the Lacedemo.
nians. ' After having obtained there advantages frofn
Cyrus, and fixed him in the interests of his country,
Lysander returned to his fleet, in the neig-hbourhood:
of Ephesus. That city was at this time plunged in in-
dolence and luxury ;. the Persian fatraps usually making
it their winter residence. LySander, therefore, labour.
ed ,to revive induffry among the inhabitants; and by a
skilful application of rewards, succeeded in making the
arts to flourish among them, and established in their city
an' arsenal for building galleys. This was one of the
principal caules of the f~ubfeqguent aggrandilement of
1Eph efu s.

Lysander, however, awed by Alcibiades, declined

coming to an engagement. But the Athenian general
having departed into lonia to raise money, -and having
committed the· charge of his fleet to Antiochus, with
politive orders to avoid a battle; his fubilitute, desirous
to display his courage, failed with two galleys into the
·harbour of Ephes~us to brave the enemy. Lysander
immediately went in pursuit of him; and the Atheni-
ans, at the fame time, advancing to protedt their com-
mnander, the fleets on both sides fell in with each other
insensibly, and came to a general sation. Lysander
gained a complete viatory, and took fifteen Athenian
galleys. W~hen Alcibiades heard of this dis~aster, he resolved
to repair it; and assembling the remains of his fleet be-
fore Samos, offered battle to Lysander Z which the lat-
ter, s~atisfied with his late advantage, thought ~proper to

decline

decline. Thrafy~bulus, in the mean time, the d'eclared
extemy of Alcibiades, availed himself of the late misfor-
tune to ruin his credit with the people, to whom he ac-
cu'fed him of negleeting the public business~, that he
might have leisure to indulge hims~elf in his debauchieries.
Observe the inconltancy of this most ungrateful and ca-
pricious people! BEelieving there insinuations, they ac-
counted the Joss of the battle under Antiochug criminal
in Alcibiades, though fought in1 contradi~tion to his ex-
press dire~tionsi Such indeed was the opinion· enteri
tained cif his parts by the Athenians, that they imiagined
no enterpris~e in which he was any ways concerned could
fail, unless by his own treachery. TheyT therefore fufT-
peaed his fidelity ; and Alcibiades, lately the idol of
his countrym~len, ·was obliged to fecurte himself from
their resentme~nt by a voluntary banishment into a di-
firiat of the Chertonefe.

Lyfandezr, in the mnean time, was emiployedd in efta.

blithing -aristocracy in all the towns he had ~fiubdued,
WC7ith a view to the a-ccomplithment of the ambiitious
projeat he was now meditating, he singled out: from the
chief men of each city those whom he discovered to
be of the most daring and resolute ifpirit, put the whole
power into thei~r hands, enriched. them by--prefents, and
by thiefe means rendered them entirely devoted to his
interests. His command being expired, Callicratidas
was !ap3pointed his suc~cessor ; and the Athenians chos~e
Conon to fulpply the place of Alcibiades.

Callicratidas equalled LyfaBnder in his military capa-

c-ity, and was greatly his s~uperior in probrityi and mnagl
naiimity. He poffeffed all the ancient Spartan virtue
without its extravagancies, and was a declared enemy
of every species of low cunning or falsehood. Lyfan~r-
der, unable to difg-ulfe his jealousy· on feeing him ar-
aive, behaved in the meanest manner imaginable, fend.
Ing .back~to Sardis all the money that remained for the
Pay of the troops, and telling Callicratidas, that he mnult
aPPly for more to the great king. To Callicratidas, a
m~an of a noble foul, and of the molt elevated in~depen-

*~$ - senc

dent lipirit, it wars the greateRt hardship in the world to
be obliged to fawn and cringe to the deputies of the
Persian monarch for a supply of money. Compelled,
howevier, by necefitzy, he at last condefcended: to go all
the* way to Lydia, to apply to Cyrus. B3ut being con-
ifantly prevented, under one pretence or another, from
obtaining an audience, he at last departed, full of in.
dignation against those who were at first mean-fpirited
enough to pay court to the barbarians ; and vowinga to
o~fe his .utmost end-eavourts to. effeft: a rerconciliation
amonIg the Glreeks, that so they might be no longer un-
dter the. necessit~y of fubm~it'ting to foch bas~eness.

It was now the twenty-fixth year of the Peloponnesian
war.Conon having been pursue~d into the harbour of
IVlytilene by Callicratidats, who there kept him blocked
up, gave notice of his danger to the Athenians, who
dispatched to his assistance a fleet of I t0 galleys, which
w~as reinforced at Samros by 40 more, furnished by their
allies. Callicratidas falling in with this fleet before Ar-
gioufke, off the promontory of Lesbos, made a vigorous
attack upon them, notwithflanding their superior num-
ber, and- funk several of their ships. But being hims~elf
opposed by the galley of Pericles, Son of the famous
Athenian of the fame name, which he had pierced with
the beakr of his, and being unable to disengage him-
self fromt his~antagoQnift, he was soo~n surrounded by fe-
ve~ral other Athenian galleys, and in spite of the most he-
roic bravery wi~th which he defended himself, fell at last,
overpowered by numbers, though not without great
slaughter of the enemy. The Lacedemonians, dif~cou-
raged by the loss of their c~ommander, gave way on the
r~ight· wing; and their left, after fighting some time
longer with great valour, fl'ed likewise. Th e Atheniains,
after~ their vi~tory, retired. into an island, and there erec?-
ed a trophy. Their loss, in this engagement, amounrt-
ed to 25 galleys; but that of their enemies to no fewer
than S0.

Plutarch, after· beffowing the highest encomiums up-

on the virtue of Callicratidas, blames him for havang

fit inprndently hazarded an engagement ; and, on that
edication, observes how highly dangerous it is for a ge-
Inerali to give way to the impetuosity of his courage, as
he thereby not only endangers his ·own finrgle life, but
likewise that of all under his cojmmand. The fame fen.
timnent is adopted by Cicero, who, talking of those that,
from a false opinion of glory, choose to haeard the fat~e
of their country, rather than in any degree to fully their
own reputation, cites this very example of Callica~tidas,
who, when exhorted to decline the -engagement is~
which he fell, answered, " Th~at Sparta might get a
sL new fleet in cafe this were destroyed, but that his

fl gacb ~~~would overwhelm him with ever ~~~g.dif .
-The Athenian generals, in the mean timhe, gav'e or-
ders to Theramnenes and Thrafybulus, to car-ry homle
the slain in So galleys, that they might be bturied with
the accuffomed ceremonies. But a violent tempest fu-
pervening,prevenrted them from executing their orders.
The reft of the fleet proceeded towards Mitylene, to
disengage Conon.

The Athenians, among whom the rites of barial were

f6j.ltriftly observed, that they regarded the amificidn of
them -as an ·inexpiable crime, grew furious, on hearing
thiat the citizens who had fa~llen in the late a~tion were
deprived of that so necessary solemnity ; and though the
emission of it in the present cafe was unavoidable, they
neve~rt~heless treated it as a capital olffence. T~hera.
menes became the accuser of the generals, though it'
as; inrconceivable how he could undertake that charge,
abnd more especially how he pushed it with such cruel
obitinacy. W~hen the Generals arrived at Athens, they
related all the circumflances of the cafe, and called up-
on every man who had been pres~ent to youch the truth
o'f~ha~t they asserted. But the matter having been car-
ried before the s~enate, it was there deterniined, that it
thould be referred to the decision of the people, who
wer~:ordered to report the opinion of each tribe di-
itinly ; and~ if, upon the whole, the generals were

Pg found

found guilty, they were to f~uffer· death. The facrious
Socrates opposed this unjuff se~ntence with all his might.
HE himself undertook the defence of the accused, and
mnaintained, with invincible force of argument, that as
by giving orders to carry off the dead bodies in or~der
to burial, they hact discharged the duty incumbent on
them ; and as the fupervening~ tempest had rendered it
impoffibl'e for ~thos`e who- had received those orders to
put them in execcution, neither party was guilty of any
fault ; and that, therefore, it would be the mloft gross
aihd cruel injufitce, to put to death men who had so glo.
rioufly and fiuccefsfully exerted themselves in the de-
fence of the~ir country.

The accus~ers, however, had inflamed t-he refeatment

of the people to such a pitch, that in sp~ite of these re-
Inonfirances, ~they condemned fix of the ten generals to
death; and they fuffered ac~cordingly.-W~;hat an un-
reasonable ungrateful people' !And how sur-prising,
that any man could be persu~aded to command their
fleets and armies !-Plato takes occation from this
event, to maintain, that· the 'fopulace is an inconstant,
ungrateful, cruel, jealous moniter, utterly incapable of
being guided by reason, a f~entimnent confirmed by the;
universal experience of all ages, and of all nations.

The Peloponnefians, overwtkhelmed by their grievous

loss at Argiixufae, sent to Sparta, to require the chief
command to be conferred on Lysander; which was im-
Inediately granted. This choice ga~ve great joy to those
who poff~efted the chief authority in the refpec?:ive cities,
who being, as before observed, the creatures of Lyfan-
der, nothing; could correspond better with their ambi·
tious views.

It was about this time that the younger Cyrus (so

called to distinguish him from C~yrus the Great, the
founder of the Persian empire), now grown preiurnaptu+
ous and vain by his great power, and the mean adula-
tion of his courtiers, wantonly put to death two noble
Persians,- Bis own coufins-german,. for no greater crime
than their omitting to cover theie hands in his presence;

an. adion calculated to give us but an unfavourable opi-
nion of that prince's heart and underflanding. But it:
thowRs us, at the fame time, that prosperity can confound
the judgment even of oinhe of the wisest of men, and
render them capable of the most extravagant excesses.
Darius, w7henr in~formed of the tragical fate of his two
nephews, -was much grieved ; and considering this ac-
tion of his son as an attack ,on hiis own authority, h~e·
sent for him under the pretence of a desire to fee him,
as he was the ir ick. Cyruis, before his departure, tranf-
mitted to Lysander large fumns of money to maintain his
fleet, and afrured him, that rather than let him want
money, he would supply him out of his own pocket.
He empowered him, at the fame time, to levy the reve.
nues of the towns undler his govei-nment, and promised
to bring a numerous naval reinforcement. -Ly~sander
wvas too wife not to avail himself fully of these favour-
able difpolitions of Cyrus.

Lysander, full of the most sanguine ex~pe~a-

tion~s, sets fhil towards the Hellespont, lays siege 4o3*
to Lampf~acus, takes it by assault, and abandons
it to pillag~e.--The Athenians, on hearing this, advance
with a fleet of I 80 fail against the enemy, halt at a place
called .£~gos Potamos, opposite to Lamplacus, and make
difpolitions for attacking the enemy next day. On this
occasion, Lysander made us~e offitratagem, pretending
to decline the engagement; and contenting himself
wRith drawing up his· galleys in battle array, in s~uch a
fifuation that they could not be attacked, except at a
difiadvantage. The Athenians, persuaded that through
-fear he seriously avoided coming to sation, carelessly
laided from their ships in the evening; and emnbark-
Sing~again in the morning, offe-red battle afreflh. In this
manner they passed four days.

Alcibiades, who was then in exile, happening to be

i3n that part of the country,. came up to the Athenian
commanders, and after repres~enting to them the danger
of their fituatioin on an inhorpitable coast, without either
;harbours or cities to which they might retire in cafe of

' P 4neceility

po~n the enemy at land, w;ith fomne Thracian troops
under Isis command. But the generals defpile~d his ad-
vice, and refused, out of jealouly~, to accept of his ser.
vice.

Lyfaupder, in the mean while, was making prepara,.

tions for attacking the Athesians, as soon as the so~ldiers
and mariners thould, in their usual carle~fs manner, leave
their thips. W~heu the expeated moment arrived, he
commanded hi-s fleet to advance in great pomp. Conon,
one of the Athenian commjanders, perceiving the enemy
appro)'aching, cried aloud to his men to come on board.
But the soldiers being dispersed among the tents could
not obey. In this critical momen't he' resolved to save
himself by flight s and takring along with him nine gal.
leys,fiet fail for Cyprus. Lysander arriving in the mneaq
time,.falls upon the ships that remained, cuts mn pieces
thnofe who were on board, as well as thof~ie who attempt
to come to their affiiftance; and then landing his men,
completes the deltrueion of those on shore. In fine,
Lysander took poffe'ifion of the gr-eatest part of the fleet,
made 30am-prifoners, took three of their commanders,
a;nd plundered their camp. This terrible defeat re~due
ced the Athenians to the most mniferatble situation they
had ever experienced, and determined the fate of the
Peloponnesian war, after twenty-feven years contmas-
anJce.

TIhis had been a very bloody war from the begiq·

ning, and it continued so to the end. It was their fupe-
riority at sea that enabled the Athenians to support at for
to long a time, and conltandly to recover from their losses
at land; and the Lacedemonians prevailed at laift, merely
by means of the immense sums furnished them by the
Persian monarch. The 3000 prifopers taken in the lad;~
battle, were, by the Peloponnesian council, condemned
to death, and were accordingly all exurdered in cold
blood. Lyfagnder visited the maritime towns, and chan-
ged their former government, from democracy to arista-
dtra6py, bellowing; the whple power in them on ·creature

efrhbis own. WTherever he .fouind any Ath~n-enias, he
commnanded them, under pain of death, to retire to A-
thers·; his plan being to reduce that c-ity by famine.

.'VTe may easily conceive the terror and consternation
occaiioned by the news of the last defeat at Athens,
which Rnw found itself without either army or fleet, on
the brink of being exrpofed to a siege, and of fuffering
all he m~iseries of famnine. The dread of there misfor-
tunes overwhelmed them with defipair. In the mlean
t~ime, however, they made the best preparations in their
poWer against the siege, of which they had to certain a
profrpeft.-In effelt, they soon found themselves be-
fieged both by sea and land. The two kings of S'parta,
Agis and Padan~ias, furrolunded them with their army
by land s sad Lysander blocked up -P~yreus with his
fleet.

The Athenians, deprived of all further resource, aind

labourinrg under the~ miseries of famine, s~ent deputies
to treat with AgiS, requeffing only to be left in posses-
flow of their city and harbour,ad ke~figning every thing
'cife. ·Agis sends the deputies to Sparta, where the E-
ph~ori insist on demo~lithing all the, fortifications of their
city., In this ineli sholy sit-uation, Theramenes offers
to go, and employ his influence with Lysander. Being
Foorit accordingly, he was induffrioufly detained, for the
fpae of three months, by that crafty Spartan, who was
rsEflved to oblige the Atheni~ans by famine to agree to
sever particular that: might he demanded. At last,
Theramlenes, and the other ambassador-s, are again re-
ferred to: the Ephori by Lysande~r, and make ·another
fourney to Sparta, where a council is called to dlelibe-
rate on the fate of Athens. No less than ~the utter de-
firudlion of that city is there talked of. The Thebans
pa~rticularly were of that opinion. But Lyfainder oppo-
fed it : and the wis~er part of the a~ffmbly declared, that
thcey would not incur the infamy of extinguishing one
of the eyes of Greece, by destroying a city, which had
reardered such Signal s~ervices to their common cause.

'After delib~erating for three months, it was at lInt re.

foblved(

folvedt to demol~ih the fortifi-cations of Pyreus, and the
long walls that communicated between that harbour and
the city ; to leave the Athenians only twelve galleys; to
deprive'them of all the cities of which they had taken
potl~eflion; to oblige them to engage in an offenfive and
defensive alliance with the Lacedemonians; and to Tferve
under them by sea and land. On these terms peace was
granted them. The deputies having returned to Athens,
and reported these resolutions, the Athenians, of whom
great numbers were daily perithing by famine, found
thems~elves under the hard necessity of agreeing to them

without hesitation. In ednfequence of there con.

4o4. ditions, Lysander entering Pyreus, saw the forti-

fications demolithed, amidst the found of a varil

ety· of mulical inficuments.-T-rhus ended the Pelopon-
nefian war.

The Athenians, by accepting the conditions dicfka~ted

to them by the Lacedemonians, had, in a manner, re-
signed themselves to the diferetion of their enemiies. Of
this they soon became very sensible. Lysander entered
sheir city, managed every thing according to his plea-
sure, obliged the people to abolish democracy, and efta-
bhihe~d thirty Ar~chons,who have been justly diftinguith-
ed in hiffory by the name of "c The thirty Tyr~ants."J

From Athens Lysander proceeded to Samos, which

he soon reduced : and the other cities, on being inform-
ed of the fate of Athens, voluntarily op~ened their gates
to the vi~tors. In each of thofie cities, Lysander put the
government into the hands of a decemvirate, composed,
for the greater, part, of creatures of~ his own, entirely
devoted to his interest; ~and, by that means, he acquired
a fobrt of sovereignty in the cities.

Resolved, at last, to return to Sparta, there to enjoy

the fruits of his success, he dispatched Gylippus before
him, with all the money amassed by him in the course of
his last Ctommand, which is said to have amounted to
r s5oo talents. Of this money, Gylippus is reported to
have stolen about a fifth part, by opening, in the n~ight,
the bottoms of the bags in which it was contained. ~But

his

his idithonefty being dircovered, he fled to avoic~bhis me-
rit~ed punifihment, and became a voluntary exite from
hi~s nativ~e country. On this occasion it was debated in
$parta, whether it were not an infringement of t~he laws,
. to idmit this silver into the city. T'he wiser fort highly
b~lamo3ed Lyfainder for inltroducing among them that
pati'iciious metal, which had always proved the bane
pandcorruption of mankind ; and they pr-esented very
firong remonfirances ori the Fubjeat to the IEphori, who
ordered the silver to be carried out of the city, and of
newt enjoined the 3.ufe-of the ancient iron coin. But this
fentence.was oppdfe~cd by the friends of LyfaBnder, who
proposed, as a conciliating expedient, that the silver
thauld not be used in ordinary currency,. but be depofi-
ted· in the public treasu~ry, to be appli~ed solely to the
fervrice of· the slate. Plutarch, however, ridicules this
expedient. It was no't, says he, gold and silver of
which Lycurgus was apprehensive; but avarice, the con-
sequence of gold and silver. ---The event show7ed, that
thie prohibition of using them commonly, had the effed~
of making them ~to be more pafironately desired ; and
thc-lagedemonians becoming soon as sensible of the va-
luersof them as any of their neighbours, employed the
niof tyrannical means to extort them from those under
their· fubjeation, imposing a tribute on all the slates that
were dependent on their authority.
::Ly~sander, now in the zenith of glory, eclipsed all
mankind in the eyes of the Greek~s, who carried their
$attery. to far as to eredt altars to him : and the man
himself being naturally vain, ordered his own statue to
be.caft in brals. Even the poets, encouraged by his
bounty, employed their talents to celebrate his praise.

that hd' might apply with the greater freedom, he re-
nounced the large poffeflions transmitted him by his an-
ceffers, declined all public honours or employments,
asnd refused himself the conveniency of marriage. He
infiruded the great Pericles in his philosophy, and as.
sifted him likeliwife in public .affairs with his aidvic~e. The
sc~holar is reproached for having negleaed his mailer,
when oppressed by want in his old age.-H--Iis prin-
cipal residence was at Athens, where he taught for a
long while; but he ended hris days at Lampfacus. W~hen
on his deathbed, the chief persons of that town having
aiked him, Whether he desired any thing to be 'done by
them, in honour of his memory, after his death ? he an-
f~wered, that he had no other request .to make, except
that the annivers~ary of his death might be eitablifhed as
a hoidcay for the boys.

Empgedocles, a Pythagorean philosopher, applied him-

self to reform the morals of his fellow-citizens, the in-
habitants of Agrigentum, who were remarkable for
their luxury and ef~feminacy. Having acquired great
authority among them, he made no other use of it than
to establish· good order. He was universally holden in
high effeem; and a poem of his, upon the moral duties
of mankind, had the honour-to be rehearsed at the olym-
pic games. It is reported of him, that desiring to pass
for a god, he ~suddenly disa~ppeared, by jumping into the
gulph of mount 1Etna.; But this is a fable; for, ac-
cording to the molt credible authors, and 'Ariffotle
among the reft, he died in the Peloponnese, in the year
of the world 357y6*

Anzacreon, the Lyric poet, was born at Teos a town

of lonia. He was much esteemed by Polycrates tyrant
of Samos, in whose court he passed a c~onsiderable part
of his life. His poems contain an exea& representation
of his life, where ease and jollity ihone through~out. Ze
spent his whole time, either over his bottle and in his

Samnours,

assours, or in composing his verses, of which thZ tender

flos wRere the only~ theme.

Addifii~r was another famous Ly ric poet. Hfis d~iitin-

gpitihing charaateriftiecs are, grandeur, fublirnity, and en-
thdi~afm. When he has once taken ·his flightt he diC.
dains .all fubjeation to ordinary rules, negleAs the con-
neaion and tradiition of common discourse, and soars,
Ekevan eagl~e, into the regions of thunder and tempest.
It ~i no longer the language of men th~at he speaks, but
that which we imaiigine of the gods. But this disorder
coInititutes th~e chief beauty of t~he ode; the aim of:
which is not to form our judgment, b~ut to warm our
imaagin~t~ion.· Pindar may be f8id to occupy a diftin~t
plae: among the poets, and to be entirely without a
ri~v-a; for, according to HEorace, it is temerity to at-
tempt to emulate him. · HIis odes display the utmnol:
fablimpity and en~thufaiaf of which poetry is capable,.
SHis sentimen-ts are firong and ftiriing, his language
pomapous, and his vertification rapid.

Efablus~C was a famous tragic poet. Before discover-

ing Ehis tailents· for tragedy, he had given proofs of his'
bravery in the engagements of PMa~rathon and Salamis,
.He isconfidered as the father of tragedy, of which he
had imbibed a juff idea from the poems of Homner.
Undi~er his hands it receive~d. an entire new form. H~e
confined the reprefestation to a particular place, initead
of being5 ambulatory as before. He dressed his a~0tors in.
long robes, buikiris, and mu~k-s; which last difguifee ranuit
howevser have greatly diminished the force of the a~tiocn.
hurmade choice of grand andinterefting fablijets ; infuitect
life and ipirit into the dialogue; diaa~ited the language
of paiIon; and excited terror and compal~ion. BT inu-
troucring a chorus between1 the aas, he procured a fort:
o~dianation to the audience. H~is language is pompous

matLt~ioc, and wras a tragic poet~ likewis~e, While yet'

bt;youn~g,' he, wa o featble ofl his own merit, as

e - to

to attempt to rival Efrchylus, and to thare with him the
applause of the public. He carried his point on his first
essa~y, and came off the conqueror of his matter. Es.
chylus survived his defeat but a thort while; for ha-
vring retired to Sicily, he died soon after. Sophocles re.
tamned his gemius, an all its vigour, to a very old age;
in the course of which he received the crown of vi~tory
no fewer than twenty times. Of all his workss seven
tragedies have only reached us. He was more eloquent
and clear than Ef~chylus, and managed the pafl~ons with
greater art. In his pieces, terror a~nd pity were more
~tkilfully produced, and aff~efted the audience with more
lively imprefirons. The sweetnes~s of his numbers pro.
cured him the appellation of Thbe Bee.a H~is excess of
joy, on account of the success of his last pie~ce, occasion·
ed his death.

Eucripides, another tragic poet, was born at Salamis,

flourished much about the fame time with the former,
and was equally fuccefsful in the fame pursuit. Hze is
arore laboured and more featentious than Sophocles.
The beautiful ·predominates in his pieces; which were
not admired in Attica only. At Syracuse, after the
defeat of the Athenians, some prisoners received their
libert'y as a reward for having recited a few of his verses.
The admirable moral maxims with whit-h his pieces a·
bound dis~cover a great deal of the philosophical spirit, to
the fludy of which he had given much .application.

Father Brumoy has been at great pains to point out

the chara~teriffical diltindtions of ther~e three celeb~rated
poets. Efohyplutsi say~s he, carried the language of tra-
gedy to a grand~eur bordering on bomnbaft. His flyle
is more pomnpous thanl even that of the Iliad.---So-
pbocles hit upon the just theatrical grandeur. He
unites dignity and p recifron in his -diftion. His flyle is
noble and majeltic.-Tlend ernes and elegance distinguish~
the produftions of Euripides; but they are less nervous
and fablime than those of -Sophocles. ---The fir {t is a
torrent that precipitates over rocks and through forests.
The s~econd is a pompous rapid river, whole waves rolla-

meandring through beautiful flowery m1eadtows.--Shake-
['peare poffeffes a great deal of the spirit of Efchylus and
-Sophocles. The best of the other Englith tragic writers
bear a nearer refemblIance to Eunripides.

-Ariflophanzes, the comic poet, was cotemporary with
Socrates and Euripides. W~ie have yet prefer ved t9 us
eleven of his comedies, in which he stands forth as a
censor of government. His elegance and delicacy of
expression, and, particularly, that Attic salt, of which
the ancients were so fond, are most valued. He excelled
in the ridiculous, and amused the Athenians with his fa-
tirical jokes ; but his buffoonry is often extremely grofir
and his obfeenity still more so.

Heroldotusr is called the father of biftery·, because he

is the most ancient author whose writings of that kind
hiave been handed down to pofferity. Hle was a native
of Halic~arnafirus, a city of Caria ; but having retired to
Sainos, he 'there composed, in the Ionic dialeft, hits
biltory of the Greleks and Persians. He takes it up at:
Cynts, and carries it on to the battle of 1VIycale under
lerzres, comprehending altogether a space of I 20 years.
But he has intermingled with it that of several other na-
tions, particularly the Egyptians. His ftyile is so flow-t
ingi-and to pure, that his bookrs, on being publicly read
at the Olym~pic games, obtained the names of the nine
MYufes. It is true, that he is full of digressions, and is
eproached for his credulity, and the pleasure he takes
so relating fables ". But it does not at all appear to have

been

"'* Here I cannot avoid taki~ng notice of a very curious circuim-
stance mentioned by Herodotus, which, whatever other inference
fnc readers many deduce from it, furnish~es a firong proof of the
lide2ity with which Herodotus reported what he heard. The passage
th w~hich I allude occurs in his Euterp6, p. x 64. of the ad folio
edition of his Hiflory, by Stephanus. He is there relating the ac-
'casits received by him from the Egyptian priests concerning the duz-
ram4 qof their country. Of this passage the meaning is in Englith this a

beren h-is iittiration to confine. hiniifelf to undoub'ted certain
·faats. He had fo~rmred hims~elf on the model of the first
poets, and t~houight it ifufficient if he kept wiithin the
rbounds of probability. It muff be confeffed, however
that. he always carefully distin2guishes between certainty,
probabilityL, and fable. In his timne flour~ihed the mo lt
famnous psoets ; and the piiaif~s of Sophocles and Euri-
pides were every where refounded. Herodotus, on his
frde, perfired a near path to the temple of fame; and

H3eredetus reports this' tradition, without int~imating his own opinion
eithyer as to the pomibility or impossibility of what the Egyptians
aiferted.--It is apparent thatlthe Egyptians thems~elves derivoed this

As the style- of Herodotus is fwreet and flowiqg, so

that of Thucydides ha$. a great deal of precision and ve-
hem~ence. T'he ·former, according to Cicero, is like a

oinoth river, rolling it waters alon g with ea~se and ma-

jefty ; the latter, like an impetuous torrent, hurrying
oni wit-h - apidfity and force.----His reasoning is firong
a~nd profound ; ~his refleaions are just, and always sea-
lonable. Unprejudiced in favour of his native country,~
oner woul~d imagine him to be of neither of the countries
whose adions he defe~ribes ;for never did hifforian
write less fromn prejudice or pufiron. His precision, it is
said, renders him oftern obscure; but this fault is over-
looked in favour of his veracity, there being no Greek
hifforian more exas. or more impartial.

-He ,is further found fault with, for having put

into the mouths: of his heroes, orations too finifbed
and regular, to h'ave been produced in the hurry
and he-at of a~ion. But they% are so -eloquent and cha.
raderiftical, that we are at little pains in examining
min~utely, whether they were spoken precisely in that
form or nolt.

Of Xenoiphon we..ihall have occaff~on to speak at great

length in the body of our hiffory. He was born at
Athens. Having engaged, when very young, in the
army of the younger Clyrus, the brother of Artaxerrxes,
he had the honour of being the chief conduaor of the
famous retreat of the I0,000 Greeks back to their~na-
~tive country. -After his return, he frerved as a soldier
till the time of Agefilaus, when he was banished by the
Athenians, on an unjust fulpicion of favouring the La-
cedemonians, becaute h'e always expressed a high opi-
nion of' thle Spartan laws. Xenophon having th~ereupoixl
retired to Scyrltante, there compos~ed his works; name-
ly, T'he Cyropedia, or, Hillory of Cyrus the Great;
The Expedition,~ or, Retreat of the i0,000 Greeks;
and, T'he Continuaation of the Hiffory of Thucydides,
from the return of Alcibiades into Attica to the battle
of Mlantinea, comprehending a sp~ace of forty-eight years.
These~ workrs display a vast extent of genius and learn-

ing;·-sanid'clearly evince the writer to have been a fkrilful
c~ommander, a j~udicious philosopher, and an elegant hi-·
fl~orian. His style is so pure, so harmonious, and to
sw~eet, that he merited the appellation of the Afthenian
Bee :. it is, at the fame time, wonderfully simple. IBut
netwithftanding this simplicity, -he ·has mantained all
.the bifltorical dig~nityi Cicero pronounces the eulogiumn
of ithis adrimirable writer in thBefe five word~s· : Xeno-
* C: phontis *oce muf·as qula/E locuras ''* so many graces
did that great orator ·discover ·in' the style of this au-
thor ! It is a queffion among the learned, whether
his - Cyropedeia ought to be looked upon as a real hi-
flory, or only as a philosophical romance. The latter
opinion is maintained by the ablest critics; and, indeed,
the arguments adduced by them appear so solid and
conviincing, tha~t~we are fizrprifed the matter thould con-·
tinue longer doubtful. He died at the age of ninety

years. -Iso~-crates the celebirated orator, was a native _of
Athens, and received his education under the greatest
matiters. -The weakness of his voice, and his 'natural
bafihfulnefits, not permitting him to speak in public, he
a~ppied himself at first to private comlpofition, cho'ofing,
for;:his f~ubje~tsi questions; of polity and government.
He likewise compofetd- pletadings for the use of others.
Afterwards· he opened a school of eloquence,· in which
the greatest orators of Greece.were formed. The furc-
cess of. this eftablifhrnent procured him both a high re-
putation and a great fortune; for he was attended by a
immber of s~cholars, who rewarded his ;painis with
very hands~ome gratuities. He likewise received large
Presents. Nicocles, king of Cyprus, for one oration
that bears his name, gave him ,twenty talents. TIhe
charaater of his flyle has been excellently- pointed outs
b~y- Cicero. "i Ifocrates's eloquence," says he, "L is
"' sweet and agreeable, replete with ingenious argu-
"' ments, and harmonious periods ;" but, in his opi-
nion, .it is more proper for imaginary cornpoitrion thwan
for real praftice. He was the first that introduced into~

PJi 2 ther

ph~e~ Greek. language, numabers, cadence, and harmony.
He was ex~tremkl~y care~ful, perh~ps t~oo much so, abohn
the airrangement of his words. It must be confeflkd,
hoWever, that thbe love of probity and virtue diftingulfhes
ble orations, which are uniformly ercalculated to inspire
both pri~ncs and fabjefts with truth, honour, and a love
for the pulbic happiness. The grief which the loss of
the -battl)e -of~ C~hronca gave him., pu·t a period to his life
in an extemea old age. .His conn~etions with Philip
mnay be justified. from his ignorance of his real charafter.
Plntarch blames Isocrates for having consumed that
time, which he ought to have dedicated to the service
of the commonwealth, in arranging-words and featences.
But thi~s criticiflu is rather too leverre. Isoc~rates had by
no mleans received from nature~ talents proper for public
business. He~ was indeed the best: rhetorician of his
time; but he: was rather qualified for t-he college than
for the camp.

Of the orator E/chines we thall have occasion to speak

more fully in the sequel.

LyJi~as, another famous orator, thone at Athens in the
itie of Socrates; and was to much interefied in the
fate of that wife man, that, upon his being brought to
trial, he in~f~ifed with him to make ude of an oration
that he had coropofed for him wit~h the utmaft care and
ingen~uity. He was always considered as one of the
finest orators of Greece. ]Lysias, says Cicero, wrote
with ex3tremle eleg~ance and precisian~; and Athens
mright ~boait of po~ffeflng in him a perfeat orator.

If~us, another orator, was a scholar of Lysias, and

imitated his mafter's flyle. very exadtly. His merit did
not appear till after the Peloponnesian war : and, in-
deed, his chief glary seems to ar~ise from· his having
taug~ht the famious DLemnofhenes.

Phid-ias, the celebrated Athenian sculptor, was the

frirt that ins~pired the Greeks with a: taste for beautiful
nature in statuary, and- taught them to imitate it. BY
the strength of his genius he had formed, in his ima-
gination, a model of ideal beauty, at which he con-

flantly

flantly aimed. His chief m~eri ay in the propriety
.and dignity with which he reprefensed the' gods. His
mrafter-pieces were, if, ~A Batase ocfMinevea of gold strd8
ivory, thirty-nine feet high, which wnas placed in the
temnple of fhat goddess. 2dly, Another ef-~)lympian Jovre,
accounted one of the fevenr wonders -of the world, sadi
of which he is fiaid to have takin the idea fro~m kie-
mer. This work procuredl h~im an imm6rtal fame : It
firuck the fpedators with afflonifh~ment. He xcelled
likewise in painting, and drew at Athens the portrait of
the famous Pericles.

1Myrsn was another renowned Athenian sculptor.
His copper cow is looked upon as his master-piece.

Zeuxvis, the famous painter, was a native of H~era-

clea. HT-e excelled in colouring. It was he who paint-
ed some grapes to naturally, that upon the plaure's be-
ing expos~ed in public, the birds came and pecked at
them. Transported with joy, he immediately challen-
ged Parrhaflus, another celebrated painter, to produce
any of his works ~that was comparable to this. Par-
rhalius painted a piece, apparently covered with a kind
of fluff by way of curtain. Come, dra~w that curtazin,
cried Zeuxis, that we may f~ee this ma/ier-piee. The
piece was no other than the curtain itself. Zeuxis ac-
knowledged hims~elf fuorpaf~fed; for, says he, I only
deceived thq birds ; but P~arrhajius has deceived even
me.

Parrhafus was -by birth an Ephesian, and the co-
temporary and rival of Zeuxis, as has been just mnen-
tioned. They two passed for the moit ikilful painters of
their time. Parrhailus excelled in deifign, in the just-
ness of his proportions, in the airs of his heads, both.
lively and languish~ing, and in the dignity of his faces.
His pidure of the people of Athens, exprethive of
their good and bad qualities, acquired him great re-
putation.

T~imanzthus of .Sicyon was another ceremporary: of
Parrhaflus. His diftingulfhing talent was invention,
and his master-piece the falcrifice of Iphigenia. In this

y 4 pidure,

piaure, after exrhibiting, in the face of the assistants,
the different degrees of afflifion felt by each, being
unable to express that of Agamemnon, the f~ather of
Iphigenia, he covers his face with a veil, leaving to the
imagination of the [Fpeftators to figure his diltrers. He
is.faid to have borrowed this idea from the Iphigenia
of Eurripides ; where the poet makres Agamemnon, on
feeing his daughter: led on to be sacrificed, throw his
robe over- his eyes,

1%omt the concluJion of the PeloponneJi~an wrar to the death

of Alexander the, Great, a period of eighty one years.

IN the beginning of this third age of Greece, wT~e

once more fee the Spartans become, by the event of

the Peloponnesian war, the leading: people in Gr eece.
This advantage they maintain for about thirty years,
from the time of Lysander to that of Conon, who en-
abled his own countrymen, as well as the other Greekrs,
to thake off the domnineering yoke of Spa'rta.

It is' in this third age that we mult fix the point of

d~ec~lenfl-on of the Grecian glory. WTe (hlall perceive,
that the ambition of extending their conquests beyond
th~ ilimits of their own coun~try, was the first caus~e of

quent intercourse with the Persians, whose magnificence
excited their admiration, inspired them with the love of
luxury. By there means the Greeks degenerated from
their former virtue; and the arts, promoted by' the fu-
perfluous calls of luxury and wealth, alone profited by
the change.

The mutual diifefeions o~f the states of Greece w~as an-

other cause of their ruin. The Persians, finding it im-
possible to subdue them by open force, attempted their
deftru~tion, by fomenting among them discord and divi.
sion; and, for that purpose, effe6Euially employed their
gold and silver, which, in all ages, and in all nations,
have been the bane -of human virtue and felicity. By
loading- with proesens those who poffeffe~Fd the chief in-
fluence in the different governments, they focceeded in
arming againit each other the two braved itates of
G~reece, who thus exhauffed their firength in domestic
quarrels. The Persians, however, were not destined to
reap the fruit of the-ir peroicious politics and corruption,
which eventually turned to the advantage of a power
with which Greece was more nearly conne~ted. Philip,
fKing of M~lacedon, made great progress in subduing that
country ; but its final f~ubjei~tion was reserved to [w~ell
thle trium-phs of his son the illuffrious Alexander,

AfairTis of Greece, froma the concigilon of the Peloponnefanz

oarla to the peace of Antalcides.

THE thirtyr archons, eftablithed by Lylander

in Athens, quidely gave way· to their tyr- 494*·

rania)Cl inmchnations; and; to enforce th6eir de-
trees:, obtained of Lysander an armed guard. This
was the signal of their aplproachin~g tyranny. Th-e rich-
r ci~ti-zenrs, and theler~ whole virtue and. influence might

he a bar to their violent proceedings, were the first
vgaiFtes of their cruelty.

.Stil/ more to overawe the- people, and to prevent a
revolt, they armed Boon of th ecitizeens who were the best
stgCled to their party,---Th~ere availing thems~elves of
their power, to ruin and deitroy their private enemies,
;Athens imnediately became one general Ecene of blood
and rapin~e. None d~urit oppole the pleasure of: those
wicked me-n. Criti~as,, of all the thirty the moll cruel
and she most wicked, carried his apprefiron and injuffice
tolwuch an extreme, that Trhersimenes, the only one of
their number who was alluated with any regard for the
welfare of his country, was provoked to oppole the de-
fposite of him~ and of his other colleagues. This drew
upon Theramenes the relentment of the tyrants; and
·Critias accused him, before the senate, of diflurbing th~e
public quiet. Theramenes, managed his defence with
(ac force of argument, that Critias, f~ufpe~ting he might
be acquitted, introduced into the s~enate some of his
soft devoted creatures,, who -from time to time indu-
fitically ex~posed to the eyes of the ju~dges the points of
the daggers, wherewith they were privately armed.
The jedges, thus intimidated, condemned Theramnenes
to death. Socrates alone, \wh~os scholar he had been,
irext~ured to oppole this sentence, and went so far as to
attempt to hinder the guards from dragging Thzeramenes
frma the altar; but he was obliged to yield to superior
forc~e. HIe then exhorted the senators and people to
avenge themselves. on their prefurmptuous, o~ppreffers.
Nothing but the merit of Socrates could have screened
hial from the refea~tment of the tyrants, who discovered
ao higher marks of their dtifplealizre, than by prohibiting
him from infiru~ting the youth.
- hs- atle of Theramenes.was be wailed by every honest
Arthenian. Xenophon has, immortalised the increpidity
iith -whrich. that celebrated At~henian moee death. He
aleli na, that when he had received and drunk the polfCon
tlithk.EBe mast fpiriing cahone~rs and fortiitusde, he pour-
d,99t the remains of it on the. ground, in the manner

of

of the libations in sacrifices, with these words, "s This
CC for the virtuous Critias." Theramenes was well ac-
q-uainted with the s~cience· of government. But his zeal
in procuring the condemnation of the commanders who
gained the battle of Arginuiae, remains an indelible blot
on his memory.

Let us for a moment cast our .eyes on the affairs of

Persia. ' Darius Nothus died soon after the arrival of his
son Cyrus at court. Paryfatis, that young prince's mo-
ther, who was extremely fond of him, had exerted all
her influence with the late king, to .perfizade him to de.
clare Cyrus his successor mn the kringdom, to the exclu-
sion of his eldest son Arfames. But Darius obitinately
refus~ed to commit an aiR of such injuffice. The new
k;ing,~ on his acceflion, assumed the name of Artaxerxes
Af"nemonz. Cyrus, grown derperate at f~eeing his brother
on the throne, vowed his destruction --Of what crimes
is not the heart capable which is altuated by ambition
alone !

Ar'taxezrces getti-ng notice of -the design entertained

against his life: by his brother, ordered him to be appre-
bended. His life, however, was spared at~the intercef-
sion of his mother; arid Artaxerxes, inficad of disabling
Cyrus from creating further diftpurbance, was simple (or
Sperhaps generous) enough to re~tore him ·to the govern-
anent of the provinces formerly in his poffefion.

That ambitious prince immediately resolved to at-

tempt the dethronement of his brother. WCith th~at view
he employed Clearchus to rais~e an army of Greeks, un-
der the pretence of afiifting. the Lacedemonians in a
war they were meditating against Thrace: and to bind
Lysander Htill more clos~ely to his interests, he is said to
have made him a pres~ent of a galley 200 cubits long,
built of ivory, ornamented with gold. Alcibiades, who
was at that time living in retirement in a remote corner
of Phrygia, easi-ly conjec~ured the real destination of

Cyus's warlike preparations. Ats A~ir-taxerxes might be
oqf great use to his affairs, Alcibiades formed the r~efolu-

tionof gvinghimintelligence of what was plotting a-

gamnit:

geida t im;i and for that purpose travelled into the pro-
vi~e-o'f ifharnabazus.- WeN thall by and by fee the con-
[4stiences of this unnatural projeA of Cyrus.
:. In~t-h'e mean time the unhappy A~thenians, over,
whelmned by their mise~ries, began to cast their eyes up-
oni-Ailcibiades for deliverance, and to concert mediures
for briinging him home. But the tyrants gettinrg notice
of their intentions, and dreading the embarras~sment that
aigh~t be thrown in the way of their projeats by a man
of such distinguished parts and aativity, signified to
LyaBn~der, that it was necessary for the quiet -and Fecu-
rity of the government, so to dis~pose of Alcibiades, that
he miight not have the power of creating them any di-
itur~bance. In consequence of their remonfirances, Ly-
faidder required Pharnabazus to deliver him up dead or
aliveZ; ·and pressed his demand with the utmost eager-
ners, fieetning to insist upon it as an effecntial conditrion
of the alliance between the Lacedemnonians andc Per-
flans. P Zharnabazus was mean-fpirited enough to gra-
tify lysander, and gave the neefifary orders for the
apprehension of Alcibiades. The guards sent to se~ize
him fl~ood~in· such awe of him, that they had not con-
rage to breakt into his hoof~e, to which there-fore they
fee Gire. Alcibiades, after endeavouring in vain to ex-
tinguilh the ~flames, ruthed through· them Pword in
hand. The barbarians, not daring even then to wait
his approach, retired before him, but at the fame time
dikhtarged at him a shower of darts, which killed him on
the ~-pot.

T'"dhus perished, at the age of forty years, this extra-

ordiriary man, at the very season that his countrymen
flood most in need of his afirfiance. His charater ex-
hibits a very singular assemblage of good and bad quali-
ties. . H·e was, by turns, the dread and the scourge of
hisbown~ country, and of the other (tates of Greece;j and
exp~erienced, through the whole .course of his life, the
mbft exrtraordinary revolutions and caprices of fortune.
Iti idn the whole, difficult to determine- whether his
beft··applarent difpolitions deserve the ·names ·of virtues.

For

Ear his condna discovers more art and address than
honour and interity ; anore vamity and ambation than
real patriotifmn; his conitant aim being to live in a dif.
tinguifhed sphere. It was from private motives ofarn-
bition that he persuaded his countrymen to engage in
the Sicilian expedition, of which the miserable conclu-
sion is justly regarded as the commencement of their
rum.n

The Athenian tyrants no longer kept any measures.

Every day was marked- with murders and imprison-
mtents; an univerfagl dejeaion prevailed ; and no citizen
appeared hardy enoulgh to attempt the deliverance of his
o~ppressed countrysmen. Socrates alone laboured both by
his discourses and example to support the droopmng f~pt.
rits of the Athenians, and to prevent therr gaving way
entirely to despair; behaving, on; all occasions, with
wonderful constancy and resolution, and plainly thow-
ing, that he flood in no fear of the tyrants.--What a
maisfor-tunle for those wtho occupy the foremolt Rtations in
life to be insensible to honour, and regardless of the o-
pinionm entertained of them by the reft of manktin-d, and
of the judgement. that ·Ihall be formed of them by po-
fierity; a disregard of reputation naturally producing
a disreg~ard of virtue. - This is the ref eat on of
Diod~orns· Siculus upon the conadua of the thirty ty-
ranLts.

The most consi~derable- c'itizes of Athens, to avoid

the crueltyr and oppreflion of these wlicked men, abane
doned their native city, and fettled in great nu~bets in
differIent parts of G~reece. It will hardly be believed,
that the Laed~emonians, whose refenterent might have
bee~n furlly gratifid by the miseries already broulght op-
on the Athenians, prohibited, on this occaffoPI, the or
th-er Greek cities from giving refuge to thos~e unforta-
nate exiles. This mean, crueljealoury of; the Lacede-
monians thockEs na; and, initead of difcofvering any
trace of the ancient Spartan magnanrimsity, throws an
indeible ta~inr on the ncharaer of their nation. Such; is
the powrer of conquth and amb~ition, to corrupt. the most

virtuous

wIinuous hearts. Two'cities orrdy, Maegars and Thebes,
disregarded this ungenierous and inhumane injund~ion+
and granted an asylum to foch of the Athienianis as im-
plored their proteE~ion.

We i~at present contemplate t~he Athenians almost 0.

rerwhbehned .by their numberless fufferings·; but we thall
by and by fee them rising above their ti~isfortunes, and
in~a manner rectuning to a new life. Thrafybulus will
ilnunediately attraa all the attention of the reader; ber
ing ~deffined~ to restore: A~thens to her former splendor,
and to display in the fight of all G~reece, how much e-
ves one man of virtue and magnanimtty is able to per-
form., In a meeting of many of his fellow-citizens, of~
fesabled by Thrafyb-ulus at TFhebes, it 'was unanimously
resolved, to make one great effort to assert the liberty
of their native country. JLyfias the celebrated orator,
who hald been banitfhed by the tyrants, levied 500 f~ol-
diers at his own expence. WIith this slender force
Thrarybulus boldly marches into Attica, and seizes Phi-
le, a ithoug fortress in the neighbourhood of A~thens.
Th~ee yrants ha~iten to oppefe him at the head of 3 ooo
men,; and give him battle; but their troops· unable to
initian the imnpetuofity of Thrafylbulus's little army,
aire ·repulsed, and retreat to Athens. Thrafybulus ha-
ving seceived a reinforcement of J00 men, fajClls upon
the Sparran guard potted before Phtile by the tyrants,
and cuts o~F the greatest part of them.

The tyrants alarmed, give orders to massacre all the
f~ulpe~ed-Ath~en ians who were able to bear arms, and
make-pr~opotls of acommodation to Thrafy~bulus. Hei
rejeas their proposals ; and having at last mustered up a
fina~ll armyr of about r coo men, advances to Pyreus, en-
gage~s the tyrants who had marched against him, and ob-
taisas the viatory. In this battle fell -She wicked Critias.
Thrafylbalus . alls a-loud to the vanqui'fhed Athenians
whbo were· fly-ing, that it is against the tyrants alone he is
Gghting, not agai-nst his fellow-citizens; and mildly up-
braids them for opposing those who were come to reflore
themn totheir former liberty and independence. They

are9

are so much affeAcd by this hariague, that, entering the
ci-ty, _th~ey immediately depos~e the tyrants, and confer the
adminiffration on ten of the principal citizens.

But this decemnvirate proved no-better than their for·

mer masters; and cornfidering themse~lves as unfecure
while Thrafybulus held poffefi~on of Pyreus, they fenr
to Sparta to crave frelh afifitance. Lysander is dispatch.
ed, to their relief, who advances towards Pyreus with an
army of Peloponnefians, and blocks up the harbour.
Thrafybulus is soon reduced to great extremity for want
of pioviflous. But Pausanias, enraged at the long pro-
~fperit-y of so wicked a man as Lysander, arrives with a
freth body of tr-oops, intending rather to favour the A-
thenians, than to reinforce Lysander. As there was a
great number of Athenia-ns in Pyreus, Pausanias com.
mands them to retire home to the city ; and on their re·
fusing to comply, attacks them. A sharp conflif en-
sues, in whjch the Athenians are workied, and oblige~d
to return to the ci~ty.

The Athenians, on being again upbraided by Thra-

fybulus, once more take courage -:and re-eflablifh the
popular government. Thpe remains of th~e famion of the
tyrants .withdraw to Eleutis;l an'd attempt to renew
the public dillurbasice. The tyrants endeavrour in vain
to recover their authority. Being decoyed to an in-
terview, they are all sacrificed to the public refeatrnent;
and Athens begins at last to enjoy peace and tranqudl-
lity. But in this civil war, raified and fomented by the
wick~ed policy of Lysander, more Athenian citizens1011
their lives than in any. ten years of the Peloponnesian

. The government of Athens is reffered to its .former
footing; the ordinary magiffrates are created; and
Thrafybulus," flill more effeaually to eilablifh the quiet
of his country, engages the citizens solemnly to bind
thenafeclves by oath to bury all palk injuries in oblivion.
This was an amion of the highest prudence; for as e-
very citizrn was intitled by law to pros~ecute those w~ho
had occasioned the slaughter of his r-elations in the late

bloody

·blood~y dissensions, the feeds of discord and hatred mnuft
·have subsisted without end. This mutual amnesty, there-
fore; brought about by Thrafybulus, was the best and
readiest method of establishing the public tranquillity.
;:he authority of Z yfander had· long ago arrived at
its height; and insolence and haughtinef~~is, the usual
cic~ncomitants of furperior power, were by him carried to
dbe most ex~efirve ~pitch, WTho~ever incurred his dif.
plib~ifre was sacrificed to his resentment ; and to accom-
plifb his designs, he ~p~ared neither fraud nor cruelty.
E ghe hundred of the principal inhabitants . of Miletus
hbadgi~een by his order put to ·death;, and the Lacede-
monians were now degenerated to such a degree, that
thfey hafely permitted one of their citizens to commit
fulch a monstrous aBt of cruelty. and injuffice with impu-
plfi~

y; - But every thing has an end.
~Pharnabazus, harassed iby the: continual pillage com-
at tr~ed in his provinces by Lysander, sent deputies to
complain of him at Sparta. This procured a letter to
be g ent him by .the Ephori, commanding his. return.
He was confounded at the order;- but obeyed, and
pleded his defence before the senate, But not ends-
rga to live at Sparta in the undiftinguilhed Ration of a
prigate citizen, he soon? left the city, under the pretence
of making a journey to the temple of Jupit~er .Ammon,

todfharge a vow. ~As h~e held in dependence the

ch~ies.of Greece, by means of the gov'ernment ~he had
ft iup in them, and of~ his partizans, to whom he liad
committed all power, the kings of Sparta thought it ex-
p~ethnt every where to re-establish democracy, and to

th t.he. creatures of Lysander. Getting notice of
Fefolutions, and hearing at the fame time of ~the

-';ayPours of Thra'ybulus to reffore Atheng to liberty,
si denly returned to Sparta, to perfunde the Lace-

oru~anss to maintamn the aniitocratical government in
;ipes. But his attempts were frfitrated by the wis-
Sos Pausanias.

E' us turn our Cyes for a moment from the affairs

of Gfreecle, to the operations of the younger Cyl
rus, its protecttion of the enterprise he had form- 40r.
ed of depriving his birother of his crowi· and life.
--A rem~arkabl: exa~mple~ of the power of ambition over~
the hurman heart ! This uhnatural attempt had for a
long while employed the eminent abilities received by
Cyrus bror nature. Hfe gave a most welcome recep*
tio-n to all those who camre from his-brother's court, anrd
pit, in pradtice: every art to detach them from his inte-
r~effs. He even pr~evailetd with the bjarbarians to s~ubi
mlit to a regular warlike discipline. But his chief de,
pendence being on the valour of the Of~reeks, with whom
the maritirme situation of his provinctes rendered hiti
more particularly conne~ted, he spared no pains to gain
th~eir affeation. Hez recroirted his gar~ifit~s with the best
soldiers of the Peloponnese, and levied an army of no
fewer than a 3,soo G~reeks. In this he was much ar-
sifted ~by Clearchus, an exiled Spartan, to whom he had
granted an asylum at his court.

SAbout the frm~e tim~e several cities revolted from the

goverrriment of Fiiffapherites, and transferred their alle.
glance to Cyrus; who the better to disguise his inten.
t~ions, f'ent bitter complaints to his brother against that
gat~ernor. T'his behaviour had the desired effeet, and
pet~rfaded Artamerxes, that Cyrus's pr~eparations were
solely against Tilffphernes. For that monarch was na-
turally oft mild, humane, generous difpefition; quali-
ties hncompatible woith· a -~fifpcious temper, and apt to
lull the mani thait poffeffes them into a Rate of too great

security. Cy~irus, b~esides, had at his brother's court patrtians
devoted to his iriterefit, wlho, by exrtoiling continually
the admfirable qualifications of Cyr'as, and hinting the
necenity of a powierful empire having at its head a man
of distinguished courage and abilities, were artfullyl
sowing the f~eeds of s~edition and revcilt. As Cyrus lay
under the greatest obligations to Clearehous, and e~ni
tertained a high opinion of his fidelity and underfland·
ing, he communicated to hint his wbhole design. Hie

a po~eiffed

;iog'effed ~at the f~ame thne such influencle with the
,Greieks, that the Lacedemonians commanded their fleet
[artnediately to join the forces of Cyrus, and implicitly
ito obey his orders.

·:3efides -the 1o,300 Greekss, Cyrrus had already levied
amonig the barbarians an army of I00,o00 men. Cle-
archus conmnaned the Grecian forces, composed of
Lacelemnonians, Acheans, Boeotians, and Theffalians:
and the ~fleet, ;corrfiftin~g of 6o reffels, was ordered to
fail along the coast, and to attend the army. -- The
,aind'us' lenophou, then a very young man, accompa-
fiied Cyrus in this expedition.

TA~ith there forces Cyrus quitted Sardis, and advanced

by hasty marches towards the upper ·provinces of A~sia.
'1iffaphernes, at length acquainted with the real defti-
·Iation of Cyrus's expedition, potted to the court of Ar-
tainerxes, and informed him of the dangfer where with he
. was threatened. In confequerice of this intelligence,
that monarch quicklcy assembled a numerous army.
-Cy~rus, in the mean time, ran a great hazard of being
ftlopped at the pass of Cilicia ; out of which, however,
hre was extricated by a -singular piece of good fortune.
Thle~ Greek troops, upon their arrival at T~arsus, begin-
m~ag ·to fisfpe6L that they were to be led against the Per-
fian monarch, refused to advance any farther; and it
tras with great difficulty, and by means of an augmen-
tation of their pay, that Clearchus appeared them, and
prevailed with them to proceed. Hlere likewise Cyrus
explained to his other troops the real destination of his
·tzpedition. Cyrus having entered the province of Babylon, affe~m-
bk~d the Greek officers, and told them, that it was not
w7ant of other tro~ops thait had induced him to employ
them, but a conf~iciofnef~s of their superior merit;, which
·rendered a small number of them of much greater ims
portance than a multitude of barbarians. He ex-l
borted them therefore to approve themselves worthy
the high opinion entertained of their condufit and bra-
tvery

R ~CAr.

Artax'erxes, inl the mean time, advanced at

46. 'the head of an imnmenfe army, amnountingi as is

alledged, to r,2oo,ooo men, commanded by Tif.,

f~aphernes, Gobrias, and Arbaces. B~efdes these, there
were in` the army of Artaxerxes i so chariots while C5y.
rus, on the other hand, had no more than twenty. The
two armies met at a place cal~led CucnatRa. Cyrus him.
self drew ixp his army in battle order, and took his owhi
post in the centre. On being intreatedt by Clearchus to:
avoid the dangerous, part of the engagement; " WThat
"' dost thou advis~e ?"Z replied the prince: " while I aim
"c at a throne, wouldst thou desire me to ihow myrfelf
"C unworthy of it ?"

A thrick cloud of dust-, abjout three -o'clock afternoon,

announced the approach of the army of the king. Hii
foot were disposed in fiquare co~lumns ; and i~n the front
were ranged the chariots, armed with feythes. The
kings himfrelf wans in the c~entre, s~urrounded by 6000.
chosen horse. Cyrus difeovered the utmloft eagerners
and joy. He had ordered Clearchus with the- Greekr
forces to advance to the centre. But as soon as they
perceived the army of the kinig mnarching~ on in good

T~Thile Cyris· beheld with prleafuare the froops of his.

brother flying before his Greeks, the person of the
king firackr his vPiew. Immediately, therefore, crying
out in a transport, "e I fee him !" he ·obeys the diftates
of his fury; gallops up to him, followed by no more
than 60ct horse; kills with his own hand the commander
of the king's guard; pierces through th-ose that were
potted before him 9 at l~ast reaches his brother, wounds
the hor~se on whtich he rode with a dart, and throws
him to the ground. Artaxrerxes having mounted ano-
ther horse, Cyrus aims a fiecondf blow at him; but is mn
his turn itru~k: with a javelin dilchargred at hi~m by the
king, and is at the fame time over whehneda by a fhowuer

:f~darts from th~e king's attendants, which laid hira
Jd~ead on the s~pot. S~everal of the principal noblemen
wrho fought bty his fide were slain : and Mezabates, by
,the:king's orders, cult off the head and right hand of
Cyrus ,A part of the prince's army hearing of his death, be-
take them~e~lves to flight, and Tiifaphernes leads on the
reft of the king's army against that part of Cyirus's which
itill kept its ground. The Greeks open their ranks and
let4 him pas~s. Artaxcerxes hearing that th~e Greeks had
defeated his left wing, rallies his troops, and advances
itoltttack. th'em, who were as yet ignorant of Cyrus's death.~
rThe· Greeks, apprehensive of beings frro~unded, place
~themf'elves in fach a fitaation as to have their rear f~ecu-
red by a river; and feein~g the kinig approaching against
them', boldly march up to charge him. But the bar-
barians give gr~ound as before, and disperse on all
'fides.

Thus fell thr: younger Cyrus a vidtim to his extra·

vagant:and criminal ambition. Xenophon has given a
finished pi~ture of this prince. By his account, Cyrus
furtpaffed all those of his years in bodily exercises. He
fulfilled his engagements with the utmost punatuality
and honsour.~ He rewarded good offices with uncom-l
maon generosity and with singular prudence, always in
proportion to real merit, nevetr by the influence of fa-
vour: and he conferred an obligation with the- best
grace in the world. He appeared to be only so far de-
lighted with fovereiguty as it enabled him to do good,;
and no other ways exerted his great power than to ac-
complifh that end. By this behaviour he gained the
love and effeem both of the Greeks and ~of the barba-
rians. But it is remark'able, that Xenophon takes no-
tice only of the virtues of this prince, and is entirtly si-
lent with refped to his faults and vices; his unbounded
ambition particularly, which prompted him to rife in
arms against his brother, whom, if the event had cor-
-:responded with his intentions, he would have deprived
both of his crown anq of his life.

AThen the Greeks heard of the death of Cy.

4o I. rus, they were itrucki with -coniternation ; and

initesid of purfuin g the enemy, turned all their

thoughts to their o·wn safety. Bunt Aertaxerxes having.
s~ummoned them to lay down their arms, received for
an-swer, That they would sooner d ie~ :That they were-
ready, however, tcl serve him as allies; but that they
preferred liberty to life.

I~n the meant time Arieuls, general of the barbarians

in Cyrus's armiy, to whom the Greeks had offered the
crown of Pertia, sent them word, that he was on the
point of returning to lonia; and that if they had a mind
to accompanyi him,. they oust j~oin himt that night.
They ~accepted his invitation, and wvere all,- except Soo,
condu~ted that night into his camp by Clearchus. At
their firit setting out they made forced mar1ches; but
could not by all their diligence avoid the perfuit of the
king, who at last: came up wi~th them. The Greeks,
as soon as they pereeived him, formed -themselves in
battle order; and by their excellent disposition1 and in-
trepid appearance, so intimidated the king, that he dif.
patched messengers to them with friendly p~rofelions,
and to acquaint them, that they had orders to con-duc2
them to certain villages, where they would be fuppied
with' plenty of provifxons. The Greeks accepted the
offer, and pasSed thriee days in those villages.

Tiffaphernes, in the mean time, paid a visit to the

Greek commanders, by orders of the king; and in a
long harangue told them, that, pitying the hardihips
andi dang~ers to which they were about to expose them-
selves, he had obtained permifiron from the Persian mo-
narch to condu £ them back to- their own country.
Clear-chus ans~wered, That; the Greeks had been led in-
to Persia by Cyrus, without being informed of his in-
t~ent ions : That by his death their engagements with
him wei-e at an end : That they had by no means un-
dertaken this expedition wcith a view of making war on
the Persian monarch, or of creating him any diflurb-
ance; and that all they requefied was a free parage to

their

Stheir native country. Tiffaphernes having departed to

report their anfwver to the king, returned the s~econd
day after, and told them, that the king did not intend
to oppose -their return j that he, Tiffaphernes, would
supply them with provilions; and as' he w~as to set out
immediately for his own province, would Accompany
them in their journey; and for that purpos~e would
qunickly join them.

The Gr·eeks, after waiting for him twenty days, were

at length joined by him, and set out under his- conduff.
13ut after this Arieus and his forces pitched their camp
·at ome difiance from that of the Greeks. This pro-
duced -some s~uspicions in the latter, who nevertheless:
continued their march. After pafirng the Tdigris by a
bridge of twenty-feven boats, they traveorf~ed the def~arts
of Media, leaving the Tigris on their left. But in- the
mean. time the fuifpicions of the Greeks were daily in-
creating. Clearchus therefore having desired a confel
rence with Tiffaphernes, in order to ·come to an expla-
nation, took occallon to remind him of the solemnity of
the engagements he had come under to the Greeks.
The satrap, by the firongeft profefions of sincerity, and
the 2warmest appearances of friendfhiip, effaced all his
suspicions. But these profeffio-ns were intended to dif-
gaife the most villanous. perfidy.

As Clearchus no longer entertained any doubt of the

fatrap's integrity and honour, he was prevailed upon,
together with the reft of the chief officers of the Greeks,
being four generals and twenty captains, to pay him a
Pifit.· As soon as the four generals, Menon, Proxenes,
Agias, and Socrates, had entered the tent of Tiffaph~er-
nes, with Clearchus at their head, they wer~e instantly
s~eized; and at the fame time the twenty captains, who
had ,remained without, were attacked and cut to pieces
by 2oo Pertian soldiers, privately potted there for that
fipecial purpofie. The five commanders were carried
befo~re the king, and by his orders beheaded. A
Thocking infkance of cruel perfidy ! Xenophon has gi-
1Yen us the chara~ters of those unfortunate command-

4 3 ers;

ers; of whorn Clearchus and Proxenes were the most
'difti ngui shed .

W7e may easily imagine the furptife of the Greeks at

the long abifence of their commanders; and the coniter-
nation occasioned among them by the news of their
fate. They no longer entertained any doubt that their
total deffrudtion was r~esolved on. They found them-
selves at the dif tance of 500 or 600 leagues from Greece;
hemmed in by a royal army; surrounded by mountains
and defa8rts; and with no guide to lead them through
the multitude of enemies that lay in their way. .,

In this general dejeaion, Xenop-hon, who had hi.

therto f~ierved only. in the flation of a: cadei, displayed an
extraordinary firmnefrs of foul. Assembling the remain-
ing officers, he told there that their courage was now
their only refodrce.. He advised them to appoint new
officers to supply the places of those they had loft; to
-burn their tents and baggage; to begin their retreat
immediately; a~nd to march in the form ·of a hollow
sq~uare, that so they m~ight always be prepared to oppose
the enemy 'from whatever quarter they were attackred:P(
A surprising inflance of what one man of genius and
resolution is capable of performing ! The Greeks,
when on the point of dispersing,- and- falling into the
hands of their enemies, are s~aved btyl the wisdom and
a~ttitrty of Xenophon, Perceiving · that- the .expedient
proposed by him was the most eligible and safe they
could follow, they immediately embrace it, and name
new commranders.
SNext morning, by the dawn, the troops being as-
fembled, Xenophon, to confirm their courage, niade
themi an harangue, wherein hre intreate~d them to recall
to r-ememb~rance the famous days of. Marathon, Ther-
mopylae, and P~latea, when their anceffeors, with armies
greatly more inferior to their enemies than they were
Do those by whom they were .at present oppof~ed,' had
nev~ertheles~s remained vi~t~orious; and to reft perfunded4
that the gods, the avengers of perfidy, would support
the~ir defence. TIhe words of Xenaophon were. applaud-

ed by the whole -army, who unanimously approved ors
his: :advice, and initantly put it in execution.

After continuing their journey for some days, con-

Rtantif dire~ting their march towards the heads of: the
great rivers till .they found them fordable; they were at
last overtaken and harassed by the army of Tiiffaphernes,
who had pursued them with all his forces. But· the
Greek's changfing their order of mazrh, repulsed his at-
tacks with very little loss on their own fide; and it
thould s~eem that Tiffaphernes very fobon gr~ew wieary of
pursuing them, fo~r after this time there is no further
mnention made of him in the relation of Xenophon.

On their arrival at the river Tigris, finding it un-

fordable on account of its depth, they were obliged ·to
traverse the mountains of the Carducae, and forced to
dispute their pairffae with the inhabitants of those- hills,
who had potted themselves on the high~er grounds. It
~cost them s~even days to make good their passage, wihich
they at last effe~ted with much labour and fatigue, after
'being obliged to abandon their beasts of burden, and
the prisoners they had taken in their march; and after
f~uffering a great deal from repeated attacks of the inha-
bitants of the country.

After crofing those mountains, they were flopped by

at very large river that ran along the foot of them, but
pas~sed it at last with much difficulty. Then entering
·theweltern quarter of Armenia, they forded- the Tigris
at its source. T~eribazos, the king of Pertia's governor
in that province, permitted the Greeks to take what
provisions they thought proper ; but at the fame time
-privatelyT resolved ,to lay an ambukcade for them in a
narrow d~efile, between famne mountains through which
:their road lay. The Greeks, getting notice of his de-
dign, prevented him, by taking poffe~ion of the pass
Jbefore him, and beat off the soldiers sent against them.

After this, having crossed the Euphrates, they were

obliged to march thr~ow ifnow from five to fix feet deep,
-This part of their journey was attended with great
.Wiidthips, apxd many of the soldiers perifhled by the fe-

verity of the cold and the great f~tiguie. . After pailing
the ihow, they came to certain villages, confrifing of
buts dug under ground, where they refied several days.
Recommencing their journey, they, soon arrived sit the
:river Araxes, or Phases. . his river being here un-
fordable, they were obliged to march about through the
mountains, where they were opp~osed by the P~hafians
and Ch~alybes, wvhomn they fb~rced~ at lait to retire.

After passing through the country of the Chalybes,

they came to a very high mountain ; whence gettmng a
fight of the sea, they were f'eizedi with a~n -excess of joy.
They had still, however, the mountains of Colchis to
traverse, and to defend themselves against the barbarous
inhabitants. But by the fkrilful difpolition of thoarmy
by Xenophon, they opposed and difperled those barba-
rians. Then falling down into the plain, they arrived
at certain yillages, where they found great plenty of
provisions, and refied Fome' days. In a few days more
they reached Trebizond, a G~reek colony, where they
halted a month. Hfere they celebrated divers forts of
games with much joy, and paid the vows they had made
to thi: gods in cafe of their safe return.

After deliber-ating whether they thould proceed from

-this place to Greece by sea, they came to a resolution
to transport only their old and sickly men in that way,
because they could not find shipping; fufficient to carry
the whole army. The reft continued their rout over
land. On arriving at Cerafus they reviewed their for-
_ces, and found them to amount to 8600 infantry, out
of a 0,000 that had undertaken the retreat but of their
hors~e only 40 remained. Coming to C=otyora, and be-
ing informed by the inhabitanats, that if they proceeded
farther by land, they thould meet with several rivers
and defiles very di~fficult to be passed, they accepted of
the thips offered them by the Cotyoreans, which ~landed!
them next day at Sinope, a Milesian colony in Pap~hla-
gonia. The soldiers f~eeing themselves now so near their na-
tive countrry, became desirous of obtaining some plun-

d~er

clerbefore their arrival. With this view, they inform-
ed Xenophon of their intentions of creating a co mmand-
er in chief ; all their measures having been hitherto de-
termnined ·by-the plurality of votes in a general council.
At the fame time, t hey intimated' their intention of con-
ferring that honour on him. On this occasion, Xeno-
phon, fenfble of their int;3ntion, and desirous to keep
himnfelf disengaged from their fa~heme, reprefednted to,
dr~exn, that- if they were resolved to create a commander
in chief, it was highly proper that a Lacedemonian
ihould fill that Rtation, as that flaFte at present occupied
the fo~remost rank in Greece. But perceiving them to
betby no rneans satisfied with this reaso~n, but, on the
contrary, obst~inate in their choice of him, he ~was for-
ced at last to tlil thefn, that he had cronf-ulted the gods
on ~thfe fabjeta, -and found them averse to his underta-
kihng the command., This elffeatually freed him from
fur~th~er -solicitation for the -prefenmt; and the choice of
the Greeks next· fell upon Chryfophorus, a Lacedema-
niat~r.

The soldiers~ beginning to indulge their de-lre of

plunder, their new general interposed, and probibited
theim· from plundering the Greek colonies. This produ-
rred mutinies and discord in the army, and laid them
lander the necessity of dividing into three ~bodies; the
Brit tof which, consisting of the Peloponnefians, to the
number of 4400 men, was commanded by Licon and
Callimnachus ; the second, consisting of n 100 men, by
Cihryfophorus; and the third, of the fame number, by
~Xenophon. Having procured shipping from the inha-
bitants of Heraclea, they embarkred at· different times,
a~d landect at Ch~ryfopolis. This being a very rich
~citon Ith~e soldiers resolved to pillage it : Bu~t upon le-
prophon''s re'pref~enting to them, that by to doing they
ihould draw upon themselves the resentment of the La-
Fedemonians, many of whom were fettled there, they
telinquithed that design.

From Chryfopolis, therefore, they~ marched, -under;

fhyP condua of Xenoyphon, to Sahaydeffa in Thrace,

upgon

upon a pressing invitation from Senthes, the sovereign
of that country, who intreated their afifitance to reco.
ver his dominions; and the more effellually to prevail
with them to comply witht his desire, promised them a
great reward. 3But after they had performed the ser-
vice for which he wanted them, he broke his word, and
refuf~ied to give them any thing; and though Xenophou
complained grievously of his injoffice,, he obtained no
redtrers. , This Seuthes was an avaricious prince, entire-
ly infl~uence~d by a miniffter void of al~l faith and honesty,
whole only aim was to increase his own private for-
tune.

In the mean time, ambaffactors from Sparta waited

on Xenophon, to inform him, that, at the earneit in-
treaty of the towns of lonia, which had embraced the
caul~e of the younger Cyrus, and, on that account,
dreaded the resentment of Tiffaphernes, they had de-
clared war against Tiffaphernes and Pharnabazus, and
had already dispatched an army into lonia, under the
command of Thymbron, to protest that country from
being ravaged by the enemy. ,The Greeks, under the
command of Xenophon, hearing that the troops in that
expedition received very large pay, engaged themselves
in the fa~me f~ervice,,w~cith the consent of their command.
er, who condufted them to L~amplacus by sea, theic
number then amounting altogether to no more than
6000 men. From Lampifaculs he proceeded to Perga-
mus, and from thence to Parthenia, which is account-
rd the period of this celebrated retreat. Thymbron ha-
ving there joinedi them with his troops, led all his army
;from that place against Tiffagphernes.

Thus ended the famous expedition of the ten thou-r

s~and; who, in f~pi~tieof the numnberlefs difficultieS they
~had to encounter at almost every Rtep, perforned in
the space of little more than four months, counting
fr~om the period of the battle of Canaxa to their ardsc
val at Pergamus, a march of a~bout I900 miles. This
retreat, the most extraordinary recorded in any hiitory,
is extremeljr admired by the anafers. in the art of war, for

for tih2 boldness of the undertakingj for the skill with
6piJdy ~i~t weas condutted,- and.. for the f~uccefsful event.
For in [pite oif the difficulties of everyt kind that seemed
to oppos~e their return, they were to lucky as to reach
~their native country viatorious.

STo return to the progres~s of our hIffory..-The Lace-

.Idedidnians were now meditating the ·extendian of their
con~quefis 'beyond the bounds of Greece. Bust before
entering upon that fubjea, the order of time requires
as o mention the death of Socrates ; an event famous
-in hiffory on several accounts. It happened twe years;
after the expulsion of th6 tyrants, upon an accusation,
of no~t acknojv'ledgin~g the gods received and worship-
ped by. the slate; of introducing a newir rehigion ; and
of corrupting the minds of the youth. It were impro-
per ha~tily to slur over the fate of this celebrated philo,
fopher, and not to take particular notice of his very re-
inarkable charader, and of the principal circumitances
pfhis life.
I Socrates was born at Athens in the year before
,Christ 469. His ~father was a statuary; a butinefs to
iW~n~caehich Socrates at ifirit applied with success. But the
~philosopher Criton having dis~covered his fine genius,
called him off from that employment, and engaged imx
in ihe fludy of philofophy;i a name then confined to
the particular branch of .it -that treated of the heavenly
.bodies. But Socrates. being Soon'" disgusted with thlis
Ithdy, as well Qn account of the difficulties attending it,
and the uncertainty of its conclusions, as of its small u-
iility~ in human life, applied hims~elf to 4thrfoto
philo~sophy, namely, the knowledge of m~an. For this
-pairpofe, he carefully fludied the passions, and laboured

~3it Hence he is justly regarded as the father of mo-;
d ~!phlofogihy. That science was by him stripped of
hadyftery and auiterity in which it had been till then
involved; and he inculcated its precepts with candour,

glicity, and precision. H is,

rior f~enfibility.---His ·method of arguing was very par-
`ti~cular. He began with interrogating his adversary like
one that slefired to be inftru~ted; from his anfwrers he
deduced conclusions, the absurdi~ty ·of which his adver-
fary was obliged to acknowledge; and in that manner
he drew him on from one absurdity to another, .till be
brought him to acquies~ce in the truth of the propoli.
tion he wanted to establish. His fthool gave birth to
[everal s~eas; of which the most ;celebrated was that of
the= Academicians. Xenophon, Aristippus, and Plato,
were the most famous of his scholars, particularly the
]lait.

T~he business of philosophy by no-means interfered

with his civil duties, He gave proof , on various occa-
fions, of his patriotifmn and courage, and served in fe-
veral campaigns during the P~eloponnesian war with dil:.
tinguithed bravery. The virtues that principally dit-
tinguifhed his private chara~ter were, temperance, in-
tegrity, and a contempt of ric~hes.- - On feeing any ex-
trao~rdinary display of the means of'luxrury and mnagni-
-ficence, he used to felicitate himself that he had not
occasion1 for such articles, and would exclaim, Of how
many things Rtand I in no need ! H~e inherited from his
father but a very slender patrimzony; which he soon loft,
by lending it to one of his friends, who was unable to
repay it. But his poverty was· accounted by him rather
an honour than a disgrace ; and he obitinately ref used
to accept of presents of money frequently offered him
by his friends .-A-Prchelaus King of IVacedonia, to in-
duce him to go and live with him, made him very mag-
nificent offers; which, however, ·Socrates rejeAed
without hesitation. His virtue was attended with ng
tinaure of aufferity : On the contrary, he was remark-
ably bjeerful ; and in· his ·conversation displayed all
that tw~ee ~t~and .afability that confthirte the prmncipal
charm of society.

Xenophon and P~lato, both his scholars, are those

who

winforn;t~ ifh us with mast of the particulars relating to
gap-edo~n and difpoition. His diftinguiihing charac-
ter~iftic was a perfe&t tranquillity -of mind, wRhich enabled
him Pto: support, waith patience, the most trozublefome
acciden~ts of life. He uled to beg of thof'e with when.

and when they did so, he inst~antly res~umed perfea

cermnment, and prudent foresight, beffowed on him byf
siture,· and improved by unremitting observation, which
eirabtled 'hitn to judge of the consequences of a~tions s

Otefiphon .---Socrates poffeffed, in a supreme degreeJ
the talent of reasoning. H~is principal employment
·iwas the infkra~tion of the youth; an ob~je~k to which
he dedicated all his care and attention. He kept;
however, no fixed public fehool; but took every oppior-
tunity, without regarding times or places, of convreymng
to them his precepts, and that in the most enticing and
agreeable manner. His lessons were so univerfaully re.
lifhed, that the moment he appeared, whether in the
public assembles, walks, or feasts, he was thlrrounlded
with a throng of the most illuffrious scholars and hear.
ers. The young Athenians quitted even their pleaf~uses
to listen to the discourses of SocraLtes; of wvhich what
we have mentioned above of Alcibiades is a signal

proo~f. His leifons we~re of th~e rnoft iniportant afe to his
country~men, to such of them particularly as aspired at
public employmen~ts. He laboured chiefly to inculcate
temnperance, continency, and the other virtues of pri-
vrate life, to inspire them with the principles of integrity
and jultice, with love for their country, and with a high
idea of the power and goodness of God.-~-His di~courf~e
with Euthydemus upon Providence, tranfinitted to us by
Xenophon, is, on several accounts, a piece of inestimable
itralue; and clearly shows, that Socrates acknowledg~ed
the universe to be the work of one. sole Being; whole
attributes were infinitely superior toi those commonly
aferibed to the heatheni deities. JFrom hiis other dil-~
cours~es, too, it is fufficiently apparent, that he secretly
entertained ·a thorough contempt fcir all the Pagan di-
vinities, which he looked upon as the produ £ion of the
poets; and that he had arrived at the knowledge of one
true God.

It was a principal objeft of Socrates's attention, toput

the youth on their guard ag;ainst a. Set of presumptuous
men, known by the appellation of fophiffs, who affamed
the name of philofosphers, and, in the eye of the world,
gave themfeve>ir of gr eat imrpo~rtance, appearing al-
ways attendedawith augresat. number of scholars, to whl

:thr~y old their inirudtion at a very dear rate. They
paitende~d to be adepts inr eiiery s~cience, and b~oasted
of-~eing able to argue immediately, and without hefita-
tion, ·on any fubje61. 'Socra~tes laboured to dikcredit
those boasters in the oplinion of his countrymen. He
i~nduc~ed them, by ari appearance of extraordinary can-
·dour, to answer his queffion ~w'hich fieemed to be very;
iitnpr~e; and then, by his admirable Ifkill in dialeEtics,
lie· very ~o~ort confounded their rearfoning. He likewise
inded~trioduly etprofed'the vices of thos~e quacks in science.
By r~thef~e mea~ir, he ~o: esaf~perated them, that they
united the~ir endeavoirrs to destroy him, and were very
~aftve in procurinig his condemnation.

Long beforre his death,:they had prevailed with Ariffo-

phanes the' comic poet to revile him on the Rtage,
in his p~lay of "C The Cloulds;" wherein he introdu- 424*
c~ed him talking impiously andimpertinently ofthe
gbdas.- This was no doubt dlone with a view, both to
try the difpolition of the people with refpeft: to Socrates,
an~d at thie fame tim~e to render himr ridiculours and hate-
ful in -thteir opinioni, thsit they might a~fterwards be the

we thallH endeavour here to deliver the f~ubftanced. Ime,
He a~ffirstled, that he had been often seen offering facri-
fices to the gods, both privately in his own family, and
publicly in the temples.--zdio, That in listening to the
s~uggestions of a particular spirit, or divinity, he intro.
duced no novelty into religion; since all other men who
consult the flight of birds, and the appearance of the in-
trails of beasts, thereby thow their· belief in divination,
and a firm persuasion, that the gods do, in different
ways, discover their wil and ypleaftxre.--3tio, That sofar

tions; had beent to fixt the proper flandard of manners,
and of the condua of human life.-4-to, That Tob far
from teaching dan-gerous doarines to the youth,-he call-
ed upon such of his fchiolars as happened to be prefect,to
bear testimony, that he had uniformly and aealoufly en-
forced the prad~ice of virtue, endeavouring on all occa-
Crons to persuade them, that it was of infinitely mo~re

their minds, and what passed within their "breaits, than

hdipers ouf the republic ; and be expressed his belidf, that

..chffing the arts commnonly praftifed, to mo~ve the
seeipaieaon of the judges, was by no me~ans an effe~t: of

idgitiproper to attempt to pyocure ain acquittal by foch

thafion of the. exiftense of a D~eity than his acenfers
aiid, on the whole, that he re~ferred his cause to the
od, ~ge~and to his J~udges.
:·Socrates pronounce~d this discourse with a firmness
a~nd intrepidity worthy his greatners of foul; appearing

a rathers

rather to diatate to his ju~dges than to plead before
them. But his undaunted behaviour irritated the ~indsge~s,
PCho would have been· better pleased to ·fee him do
bomage to their power by a timorous and fubbmifive be-
haviour. By a plaurality of voices, therefore, they de-
clared him guilty ; but did not, by their first sentence,
determnine the pumfhment. -In such a cafe, the· criminal
.had a privilege of choosing any one. of the different
punithments- ena~ted for hi's offence, and was intitled to
require an alleviation even of that. But Socrates
thought it unworthy his chara~ter to take advantage of
this indulgence, though he had> it in his power to insist
on being punished, either by imprisonment or a fine.
But to avail himself of this privilege might, he said, be
interpreted to be an acknowledgement of guilt;. and he
added, that if he were to choos~e the requital he thought
he merited, he thould insist on being maintained, for the
remaining part of his life, in the Prytaneunik, at the pub-
lic expence, since he had constantly emplojyed himself
in the service of his` country, by inspiring his fellow-
citizens with the love of virtue.

The judges, provoked at his indifference, condemned

him to-die by drinking the juice of the hemlock. This
senten~ce did not at all th'ake- the fortitude of Socrates,
firmly perfunded, that guilt is the only evil of which a
wife man has reason to be afraid; and choosing rather,
says Qluintilian, quietly to resign the few years of life he
- had yet a probability of enjoying, than by a mean sub-
miiron, -or pusillanimous conduA, to throw a blemish
on the glory of his past life. "C i am going," said he
to the judges, "L by -your sentence, to· fuffer death, a
** punithment. denounced against me by nature at the
** initant of my coming into the world ; but my acco-
** fers are, by the sentence of truth, condemned to the
** Rtings and remorfes of a guilty conf~cience."

Socrates spen-t the thirty days that intervened betwixt

his sentence and death in conversation with his friends;
and in spite of the painful- exp~e~ation of the fatal mo-
ment, uniformly, behaved with the fame calmners and

for-

Artlitude. The evening before his death, he gave a
ftiten~ger proof still of his magnanimity. For upon be-
ig 'in-formed by Critoi the most intimate of his friends,
tha~t he -had an opportunity of escaping from prison, with
ihe .connivrance of the jailor, wh~o had been gained over
for the ·purpose, he absolutely refused to avail himself of
that expedient; telling him, that he efteemned himself
ha~pp~y to be deprive of a life which was beginning to be
ai:iiurthen to him ";
. Plates telates, at -great length, the! various motives
ilrged· by Crito, to perfizade him to make d~e of the
means of prefervilng his life, which the endeavours of
hisifriiends had procured for him. - He set: before his eyes
t-~i~nj-uffice of the featence; and argued, that it was his
d~ yto preserve his countrymen from. the guilt of' put-
tinig to death an innocent man; that his children flood
in need of his proteation, &c. &tc.--Socrates, in answ~er,
proved to him, that a man condemned to die, though
unjoftly,~ is guilty of a crime, if he withdraw himself
from the- punishment inflifted on him by the laws and
judges of his country.ifA do~trine, however,. that will
finld few partizans; for, in foch a fingation, the love of
life, firengthened by the idea of injuffice, generally out-
wei~ghs foch refined confi-deratiors .-El~e further de-
montirated to him, that every unlawful a~t, be its mo-
,tiveor consequences ever so laudable, is criminal in him
that commits it, even though dire~tted against those: who
have injured him; in other words, that it is a crime
to -return evil for evil; but, with refped to his owtn
·particular cafe, he demanded what adrwer he could.
ia~ke to the laws of his country, for flying fromt the
putthithment now by them imposed on him; againftr
Which, even the plea of returning evil for evil would
nroto;apply~r This is heroism in all its purity. Crito,
un'able to refute the arguments of Socrates, was obliged
to yie~ld to his in~flexibility.

* He was then fixty-nine yrears old:

immortalit~y of the faul was that day the fubjeit upon
which they difcourled. The fnbltance of their reason,
ing, on this point, is contained in the dialoggy of Plate,
entitled P~heda.. Socrrates there a4dduczes all the argu.
mnents that, in hkis opinion, dbtab-lih che immortality of
the foul, and refutes thof< infilted, on to maint~ain the
contrary. dodbr~ine. He thqwsg, that the desire of: death
entertained by a wife man., myth principally arise front
his wilhing to enjoy the happjinefs awaiting him in Aano
t~her life. But he argues, that as man, is entirely de.
pendent on the will of that Surprenae Reing who has
created him, and placed him in th~e flation he here occu-
pies, he must not therefore; q~uit Et wit-hout the permillion
and command of that Supreme Being.----He concludes
his reasonin~g on the immersality of the fooyl wirth this
argument, that, supposing the- reasons urged in support
of each fide of this quetio~n to appea-r of equal weight,
a wif~e man will embr~ace thlat conclufrion which seems
to be attended- wnith least haz~ard and toolt advantage.

Socrates ne~t· proceeds to deduce several conf~equen-

ces, on the su~pposition of the certainty of the itemort~a-
lity of the faurl.·-He thi~nks there muit be a floaljudge-

Cicero has defer-ibed, with great elegance, the lofty

fe-ntimentrs and magnanimous behaviour of S~ocrates at
hris death. W~hile he held the fatal cup in his· hand, he
declared, that he considered death, not as a punishment
inflifted on him, but as a help furniihed him of arriving
so m~uch sooner at heaven. He gives it as· his opinion,
that obn the departure of our fouls from our bodies, there
are two pafiages for condu~ting them to the places of

their

pair delbination; -one leadinig to thht slate o~f purgatory

Evagoras, king of Salamis, the capital~ &' Cyprus, de-

serves a place an the hiffory -of Greece. He was de.
f~ended of the ancient kings of that island; brit a tyrant
had usurped their throne and made it dependent on the
Persian power. Evagoras was- born under the reign of
that tyrant, He had received from nature a very grace-
ful person ; and, from his infancy, gave signs of the best
and most v~aluable talents of the mind. 3 W~hen grown
up, he was mn great danger ofabeing murdered by the
tyrant j and was obliged, for s~afety, to retire from Sa.
lamxs. But returnmng soon after, at the head of no
more than fifty men, he dethroned the tyrant, and
mounted the throne himself, with the. approbation of his
fell~ow-citizens. He immediately applied himself to raise
his freall kmngdom to a flourithing condition a and made
it his chief Rtudy to rule with juffice. He had already
acquired great reputation, when Conon, after the un.

forunae ngagemlent at Egos Potamos, chose his -court

for an asylum, where he contraated a most intimate
friendilup with Evagoras,

On that occasion, Cononi, comnmiferating the misfor.

tunes. of his country, had the address to prevail with E.
vagoras to second his endeavours for her relief - and
they ~applied themrfelves to concert th~e most proper
means for weakening the power that then aspired to the
f~orereignty of Greece. Evagoras perceiving, from his
fitrsf correspondence with the fTatrap of Asia, howA
t roublefome and dilagreeable the daily exaftions of the
Lacedemonians were become to the Persians, advised
them to make Corobn commander of their fleet, and to
attack the Lacedemonianls by sea,

Soon after, however, the affairs of Evagoras affamed

a very different appearanceor having at'tempted- to
reduce the whole island of Cyprus under his power, the
Cyprians implored assistance of the king of Persia, w~hole
interest it was to support their independency. The war
wras, at firit, carried on solely between Evagoras and the

`the islanders. But as soon as Artaxerxes 1Vnemon was
fresd of his war with the Greeks, he turned his whole
force agaid'it Evagoras.

The; Persian army codifited of 3oo,ooo men, and

·their fleet of g oo galleys; while Evagoras could hardly
adher up so,ooo soldiers and go galleys. But notwith-
flan~ding .this vast inferiority in the number of his troops,
he, made shift to defend himself againif his eneanes.
He availed himself of every resource of' military ikill ;
and having, B~y means of his light frigates, funk and
destroyed the vidualling transports of the Persian army,
he reduced them to great straits for want of provatiions.
Receiving from Achoris king of Egypt a reinforcement
o~f £6o galleys, with some money and corn, he defeated
a -detachment of the Persian land-frc~es, and soon after
obtained another villor y at sea. ~~But the Perf ian forces
Sbein~g still extremely mnore numerous than his, soon -

land. Evagoras, feeing no profped of any farther re-
source, -found hims~elf under the necessity of fumng for
peace; which was granted him, on the condition of his
coqfining his government to the city of Salamis alone,
and of paying an annual tribute.

His son Nicocles succeeded him. It was for this
o~ung prince that the famous Isocrates composed the
oration, intitled E~vagoras, from its being the eloglum
of that king. In this piece, the Athenian orator pro-
;poses Evagoras as the perfedt model of a good king;
anmd labours to prove, -that fine parts and magnanxmity
are essential requisites to form a prince ors that charaater,
le repref'ents Evagoras as a man of an excellent under-
flanding; and he tells us, that, after arriving at the

hone, that pr~ince dedicated much of his time to read-
ing·; particularly to the reading of hiffory : That he
ap~plied himself carefully to fludy the charaders of men,
tbat ·he might know how to employ them according
to their particular talents : That he never re~solved on

discovering his .singular merit, appointed him general
of a great army destined against Egypt. But before his
departure on the Egyptian expedition, the king corn-
manded him to endeavour to seize the person of Afpis
,the commander of an army on the borders of Cappado.
cia, who had revolted. In this commillion, dangerous
as it was, he focceeded, made Afpis prisoner by f~ur-
prile, and carried him to Susa.

His extraordinary genius and valour created against

Datames several enemies, who calumniated him to Ar-
taxerxes, and rendered himt iifuclped. Datames re.
ceiving intelligence of the danger ·that threatened him,
quits abruptly the se-rvice of the king, retires with a
few troops, s~eizes on Paphlogonia, joins Ariobarzanes,
defeats the Pifidians, who had risen against him, and'
takes their camp. Artaxerxes, terrified at there ex.
ploits of Datames, sent against hibr into Cappadocia
an army of near soo,ooo men, under the command of
Autophradates- Datames had hardly the twentieth
part of that number ; but as he excelled in the art of
ranging an army, he difpof~ied his men so ikilfully, as
to prevent their being surrounded, and at the famne
time to render the far greater number of the enemy of
no ure. By there means he put the royal army to flight,
with prodigious slaughter.

The Persian general was equally unfuccefsful in feve-

ral lesser engagements that ensued; and at lait he was
forced to make advances for an accommodation. Da.
tames, desirous of recovering the favour of Artaxerxes,
for whom he had always retained an affceaion, listened
to his proposals. But Artaxerxres, provoked at being
unable, with all his mighty forces, to reduce a petty
governor of a province, was base enough to employ
treachery to destroy .him. Datames at firit was fa
lucky as to escape several ambushes that were laid for
him. But MJithridates the son of Ariobarzanes, having
been corrupted by extravagant offers made him by Ar-
taxerxes, to free him of a man who had incurred his
inveterate hatred, by being able to resist him, took ad·

vantage

iat~age ·of a mo~ment when Datamnes was alone· and un-
it~inediin his company, to flab h~im with a sword.
,Datames, to have arrived at as- high a reputation as
any ~hero of antiquity, wanted nothing but a more con-
[pionous flage to aB upon, and a poet or hit~orian to
record his ·exploits. It is indeed surprising, that the hi-
Rorians~ of those times have taken so lit'tle notice of a
man of-fuch diftinguithed abilities. -But in all proba-
bility· this has been owing rather to ignorance t-han de.
rg~n. His merit and exploits des~erved to have been·
celebrated biy a more copious hifterian than Cornelius
N~epos. .It is now time to resume the affairs ~of Greece.

SWE have already mentioned, that Thymnbron was
difpiatched by the Lacedemonians into lIopia, to proted
the-cities of that country from the .retentment: of Tif~-
faphernes. But Thymbron being soon recalled, on ac-
eount of some mif~underitanding, Dercillidas was sent:
thither in his place; who taking the command of the
army at Ephesus, marched into the province of Pharna-
bases, where the greater ~part of the cities of a~tolia
opened their gates to him. He then concluded a truce
with . Pedfia.

·The hiffories of that time are full of the praires of the

pr~udence and heroifmn displayed by a lady of the name
of Mania, the widow of Zenis, who had governed E.~
-telia as deputy under Pharnabazus, to whom - he ren-
deired sig~nal s~ervices. Having loft her husband, IVania
waited on the satrap, and begged, with the greatest thew
·ofo~refolution, that he would intrust her with the power
enjoy~ed by her husband, promising to serve him with
-the faml zeail and fidelity. Her desire was granted; and
hef~ulfilled her engagements most effe~ually ; ading,

As~-~ Siparta, upon the death of KCsing Ageli~s, Agefilaus
ai~diciaim to:ehe ryal dignity, in pr~eference to Leoty-
Ithides, the son of Agis's quxeen, whom he affirmed not
to have been begotten by Agis; and who, notwith~i~n~d-
ing the dying acknowledgmnent of bire by that ki~ng,
was~ genera~ll reputed a ba~dard. OQn this account, A.~
gefLlas, su~pported by Lysander, -antd other principal
S~partans, found little difficulty in obtaining himself to
hauflealare kin~g, in preference to L~eotychides.
: Agefilans., ed~ucated in all the firiatnef~s of the Spar-
taridifcipin e, wrhere he had learned obedience be~fore
he: came to exercise command, was by that means temn-
parate, mild, and popular, and3 soon acquire the as-
fi~tisin of his countrymen. H~is diminutive ftatur and
laspaenpfks were amply compensated by a fine fac~e, ex
traordina~y- vivacity, a bravery fixperior to all danger,
anddmggliar: knowledg~e in the are: ojF war. Naturalily
saanem~y of flattery, he wou~ld not permit his piftere to
sejdr~awa y. fayig, that his exploits, if ever he thould
ierfom any, woold afford the best and meft lalting
'numment: to. his memoiry. Being of a very complai-
sant and obliging difpolition, even .to hi~s enemies, he
thbroby o·:.~btaine d so: high 'effeem and credit at Sparta,
that the Ephori thought it necessary to imlpefe a fine up.
owh~Iim for having, as they said, acquired too great -fa-
ve~r W~i~th his fellow-citizens : A feantence that bore a
firong res~emblance to· the firange law of offracifm a-
;sag the. Athenians. Though on becomi~ng kring he
. Rii~ceeded of eourf~e to the estate and -effeas of Agis,
Leetychides being declared a blafard, yet he thared

1'; them

them all w~ith him and his relations, who were very
poor; an aation that rendered him still more highly
effeented by' the citizens. Never did king possess fuck
;absolute power at Sparta as Agefilaus poffeffed. This
was in a great meas~ure the effeet of the deference and
refpe £ paid by him to the Ephori, contrary to the cul
itom of his predecessors in the regal dignity; who, re-
gard~ing the Ephori as their rivals in authority, took
every opportunity to treat them with difrefpeilt.

The Lacedomonians hearing that the king of Persia
, ~was equipping a fleet against them, ordered A.
396. gefilaus to carry the war into Asia ; giving him

by way of afif~tants thirty Spar tan officers, of

whom Ly~sander was one, together with an army of 2030
chosen Helots, and 6000 sol~diers furnished by their al.
lies. T7he fame of the retreat o~f te Io,000 Greeks had
every where inspired a high opinion of the Grecian va-
lour, and gave the Greeks thems~elves additional con-
fidence in their own firength. The Lacedemonians
therefore thought it incumbent upon them to deliver
their countrymen from their dependence on the: barba.
rians.,

Tiff~aphernes not having completed his preparations

when he received information of the arrival ofAgefi·
laus at Ephesus, had recourse to ficatagem; and propo-
fed to Agefilaus, that if he would abitain from commit-
ting hoitilities, the Persian monarch would permit all
the Greek cities in AGa to re~main in the enjoyment of
'their liberty. Agefilaus having agreed to this proposal,
a truce was concluded, and confirmed by the oaths of
both parties. But the satrap neverthelers proceeded
w~ith his warlike preparations.

Agefilaus in the interval made a tour through the

principal cities, with a view to redress grievances, and
to put the government on a proper footing. But he was
so piqued at th ecourt every where paid to Lyfanderi, as
the person on whom the ruling men suppos~ed thernfelves
chiefly to depend, that he could not help expressing his
displeasure on that head to Lysander; who, naturally
vain, and accuffomed of a long while to receive univy

fakrepgelt, paid little regard to the complainrts of his
king. Agefilaus, provoked at his insolent behaviour,
affe~Aed to iemploy him in the least bonourable pieces
'of butinefs. Lysander becoming thereby sensible, that
he had at last met with a man capable of humbling him,
cntrived a pretence for returning to Sparta.
- Full of: relentment against Agefilaus, he formed a
plan~of opening a passage for himself to the throne. As
only~ two branches of the pofferity of Hercules in Spar-
ta were underflood to have right to the regal dignity,
aand-isi he himself was likewise believed.to derive his de-
k-ent ~from the Herculean flock, he thought it would
beino~r di~ffcult matter to prevail with the Spartans to
exgtend the exclufivre right supposed to reside in the two
former branches to all the other. descendents of Her-
aules; la-ttering himself, that if he were able to accom-
plifh ·that, no person would prefumne to compete with
himself for the crown. H~e had been conitantly medi-·
taking this scheme since he had first arrived at the height
of his- exrorbitant power, which indeed was little infe-
rior -to that of royalty its~elf, -and he had put in praftiee
soar l contrivances to procure from the Delphic priefit.
o~ss ~a declaration corresponding to his views. But his
whole plot for that purpole was fruffrated, just as it was
on~lthe point of being executed. For Silrenusr, the young
man, _who was suddenly to appear and to announce him-
fell~to be the son of Apollo, was seized with fear, -and
ranslaway. It wa~s not discovered till after the death of
L~ysander that he had been the author of this trick. (
-:liffaphernes having at last assembled all his forces,
ASet an insolent message to Agefilaus, commanding him
to' depart from Asia. The Spartan, incensed at the
:e~rfidy of the satrap, made a feint of leading his army
towards Caria. Tiffaphernes followed him. But Age-
dilaus making a s~udden turn, marched dire~tly into

Argia, took several cities, and acquired immense

plander. After dividing the plunder among his officer s
akd soldiers, he retired to Ephesus for the winter ; du-

leave Asia ineff'eAual, resolved to create a diverflon
to the Lacedemonian arms, by promoting against them
a confederacy among the other Rtates of Greece, whom
he knew, on the most authentic information, to be ex-
tremely uneasy and impatient under their fabjecltion to
Sparta. TIimocrates was charged with the execution of
this scheme. To accelerate its success, fifty talents of
money were delivered to him, with which he was to
endeavour to bribe thie leading men in eachcity, that they
might in~tigate their countrymen to take arms against
the Lacedemonians ; who indeed, by their ovierbearing
behaviour, had but too well disposed the other slates,
whom they treated more like f~ubjeats than equals, to
embrace fach a measure. T~limocrates, therefore, met
with all the foccefs in his negociations that he could have
desired ; and the Tshebans were the first who resolved to
aftert their independency.

The Athenians very soon joined the Thebans. Over-

lookin g allfor'mer fubjeas of displeasure received by them
from that slate, they embraced this opportunity of re-
covering from their long humiliation, and, by the per.
fiuafion of Thrafy~bulus, granted the afif~tance demanded.
Onl the other hand, Conon, who was in high favour at
the Persian court, used all his influence to obtain an ar-
mamentt for the relief of his coc~untrymen, and was ex-
tremely artive in promoting the confederacy againlt
Sparta. An opportunity of coming to an open rupture
soon pr~ef~eted litfelf. Adifpute hmaving· arisen between
the Phocians and Locrilans, about the property of a
fmnall piece of ground, the Spartans, already difplleafe~d
with the Locrians, resolved to support the Phocians;
and, for that purpose, ordered Pausanias to march and
join Lysander,· who was then in Boeotia with a few
troops. But the Thebans, to prevent this junation,
made a brave attack upon the troops under Lysander,
obtained a complete viaory, and killed Lysander him-
self in the bacttle.

Thus fell that renowned Greekr, who raised his native

city

city Sparta to a degree of power the had never known
before, and entirely ruined that of Athens. It was
matter of general futrprife, that he left no wealth behind
him, considering the vast influence he had enjoyed, and
:the many opportunities ofamaffing riches that had been
in his power. This contempt of wealth refleaed honour
on .his memory, and plainly showed, that ambition was
his foble motive of a~tion. T'he excess of this passion,
horwever, obscured the splendour of his extraordinary
parts; for he must be allowed to have been an intrepid
and skilful comnmander, a confaummate politician, and
of .very artful address, in managing the different tem-
pers of men. H-e had, by there means, rendered himi
self as absolute in Sparta as in thie cities of Asia. To
his partizims and favourites his gener~ofty: was bound-
less, and his partiality exceffve. He not only s~upport-
ed, but even co-operated with them in all their private
s~ch~emes, however base, unwcarrantable, or unjust ; em-
·ploying in their behalf every· species of villany, and
·iifliiating without remorse the most barbarous cruelties.
To his enemies his refe~ntmrent was implacable, never
ter~minating but with their deaths. Fraud and cruelty
formed the most firiking features in his charaater. Vain,
even to insolence, .he desired to at~ on all occasions
wRithout controul. According~ly, we have s~een him en-
de~avouring, to the utmost of his power, to ecliple even
his king and matter Agefilaus. W~e have likewise seen
him~difcover the meanest jealousy to Callicratidas, whom,
by the bafeit of: artifices, he endeavoured to throw into
an embarrafinment that might fully his glozry.--He was
the w~orst enemy that ever Athens felt; and by eftablith--
ag there the thirty tyrants, he was to her what Sylla
·after him was to Rome,--His tyranny and oppression
rendered Sparta odious to her neighbours.
-i When Pausanias returned to Sparta, he was accused
of mifonduc& in the late expedition ; and, though one
:of the two Spartan kings, was condemned to f~uffer
·death. But he avoided the cruelty of his countrymnen
by .flight.

TF a L~e

Let us now look after Agefilans. In the midst of his

preparations for leading his ar-my into Pedia, he recei.
·ved a letter from the Ephori, commanding him to re-
turn to Laconia; for, byp this time, Greece was alli~n
arms.. Agefilaus immediately wrote them an account of
his \formner operations, and informed them of the favour-
able difpolition of his affairs for attacking the king of
Persia; but aifired them, that since they thought his
presence at home neceffasy,' he was resolved to obey
them without delay.

Hifforians have, with great juffice, applauded the re.

fpe~t thowln, on this occasion, by Agefilaus to the ma.
giffrates of his country ; in obedience to whom, he
ftopt thort in the midst of his fuccefsful exploits, which,
in all probability, must have eventually subverted the
Persian empire. By this behaviour, he undoubtedly
discovered a very uncommon greatness of foul, and jus-
tified the faiying of PaufaBnias, of whom we have been
just speaking, "C That at Sparta the laws governed the
CC men, and not the men the laws."-W-Ihat a le~fon for
the members offoine modern governments !

Before Agefilaus reached Sparta, his countrymen, at-

tacked friom every quarter, had s~everal very s~evere
tlhocks to fuutain. The A~thenians marched against
them, followed by the Boeotians, Corinthians, and Thel
bans, forming altogether an army of 20,0o0 men.
The Spartans wcith an army of about a 4,ooo men, of
w~homn the greater part was furnished by thieir allies,
met the enemy near Lycion. The engagement was
long and obstinate. But the Spartan valour prevailed
at last, and snatched the vietory from the Athenians,
wvho, though deserted by their allies, kept their ground
to the la~tt

WChile affairs were thus proceeding at land,

g 94. an important engagement happened at s~ea. Co-

non, with a fleet of a co thips furnished him by

Artaxerxes, setting fail towards the Chertonefe with an
intention to attack the Lacedemonian ·fleet, confiiting of
tao thips, fell in with the latter near Unicios, a city of

Caria

Caria in Asia Minor. The Lacedemonians, who were
4-ommoanded by Pifander, gained some -advantage at
~firit. But viatory fooni changed sides. The Lacede-
moniams were beaten and put to flight; and Pifander,
after ·exerting the utmost valour, fell at lait fightring
bravely. Conon remained viaorious, and took fifty o~f
the Lacedemonian galleys. From that day forwards,
the naval power of the Lacedemonians was continually
on the decline.

It is remarked, that the ruin of the two slates of Akthens
anrd Sparta was alternately occalloned by their hanghty
behaviour during their prosperity ; the Lascdemoniansn
having neglei~ted to profit both by former experience,
and by the firiking example lately set before their eyes
by the Athenians.

Just as Agefilaus was on the point of arriving
at S~parta, he received a message from the Ephori, 394*
intreatin~g 'him to march, with all haste, into
Boleotia, where the army of the· Lacedemonian~s and Or-
chomenian~s on one fide, and that of the Thebans and
Argives on the other, lay in fight of each other in the:
plains of Cheronea.--Agefilaus arrived in time enough
to takIe the command of th~e 3Lacedemonians, juff as
they were on the point of engaging. Xenophon, who
was present at this battle, fiays, that of all the battles
which had till now happen~ed in his- timne, this was fought
with the most depenrate fury.

The Thebans were thrown. into diforderz, and Agefi.
lans.attempted to cut off their retreat. But they imme-
diately drew up their foot in a sq7uare column, -the1 front
of which baffled atll the efforts of the Lacedemnoni-ans to
break them. The engagement w~as very bloody.-A-~
geillaus exerted prodigies of valour ; received severa~l
wounds;, and mluft certainly have been either killed or
taken, had be not been rescued by fifty you~ng Spartans,
wAho that day foughtlby his fide. The Lacedemonians,
at length, finding it imnpofilble to breack the Thebans,
oDpened their ranks to let. them pass, and th~en attacked
the~m in the rear. But the latter, proud of having hi-

T 3 therto

therto repuls~ed the enemy, retreated very leisurely, and
in good order,~ fighting all the while.-A~~gefilaus, tho'
wounded, refused to retire from the field of battle,
till he~had fieen the dead carried off on their thields.
Next day, he ereaed a trophy as a monument of his

vi~tory. A~t Sparts he was received with transports of joy. Un,
tainted with the luxury and pomp of the country whence
he was jult returned, he retained his former simplicity
both in his~ person and family ; perferred the temperate
auffere life of the Spartans to the delicate luxurious
manners of the Barbarians; and, in~itead of the haughti-
pefs and pres~umption of a vic?orious commander, dif-
played the moRt humble modeify ofa private citizen.

On hearing the power of the Persian monarch highly

extolled, and that prince himfelif honoured with the title
of Great K~ing; "C in what refpeat (s~aid Agefilaus) is he
CC greater than I, if he be not more virtuous ?")-HFe
f iet a higher value on the exrercif~es that ftrengrthen the
body, and inure it to labour and fatigue, than on the
hors~e and c~hariot races at: the Olympic games, which,
hle flaid, were not a proof of bravery, but of riches.-
Having~ found, among the papers of Lysander, the de.
taillof his plot against the two Spartan kings, he resolved
to lay it before the citizens. But he was diiffiaded from
this fiep by a prudent man of his acqluaintance, who
:advised him to let Lysander reft in his grave, and to
bury along with- him a very artful discourse found by
Agefilaus, which Lysander was to have addressed to the

Spartanls. Agefilaus soon after marched away with his land-
forces, and laid siege to Corinth by ·land, while his
brother Teleutius blocked it up by sea.

In the mean time, Conon, after his viatory at Cnxdos,

obtained of Pharnabazus fifty talents, to restore Pyreus
to its former si~tuation. He was likewise continued in
the command of the: fleet. After ravaging the coaits of
ilaconia, he returned to Athens, and was there received with

with the highest marks of joy. The conf'cioufnefs of
being the reltorer of the power of his country, and of
having rebuilt the walls of his native city, mult un-
doubtedly have afforded him the moss sincere pleafare.
-It is remarkable, that the city of Athens t~hould be in
a manner rebuilt at the expence of the fame Persians
wh~o had formerly reduced it to ashe~s.

Conon, afteir having reffored Athens to its former

situation, and by that means enabled it to repel the at-
tacks of its enemies, sacrificed a hecatomb to the gods.

The grief and rage of the Lacedemnonians, at feeing

their ancient rival raise~d, as it were, out of her ruins,
and reffiored to a condition of being still formidable to
them, are inexpressible. T~hey foresaw, that their so-
vereignty over the reft of Greece was on the ·brinks of an-
nthilation. They therefore immediately resolved to vent
their rekentment upon Conon the chief caus~e of this re-
volution; and, for that purpole, dispatched Antalcides
to Teribazus, governor of Sardis, with propos~als of
peace with the Persian monarch. The Athenians sent
~deputies on their part likrewife, to prevent the success of
the Lacedemonian negociations. But their endeavours
were unfuccefsful, and Conon was the vi~tim of the in-
finua~tions inflilled into the Persian satrap by Antalcides,
who accused him of having applied the money of the
king to th~e re-establishment of Athens ; and of having
formed a planl of detaching .ZEtoia and lonia from their
dependence on Pertia. The better to incline Artaxer-
xes to peace, the Spartans were mean spirited enough,
once more to fhubjeft to his power all the Greekl cities
in Asia, for whol~e liberty Agefilaus had so gloriously
fougfht.

We are not told by what means Teribazus was in-

-duced to believe the accusations of Antalcides against
Conon. ICt is certain, however, that he caused that
·illuffrious Athenian to ·be apprehended, and that he
furnished the Lac~edemornians with considerable s~ums of
mroney. But he declined to conclude the peace without
-the approbation of his matter.

T 4 Hlifforiaris

Hifforians are -not agreed about the fate of Conon,

1Some. of them allege, that he was conduated to Ssfa,
and there beheaded by order of the Persian monarch.
They further fay, that he entertained dangerous designs
agfainft the Persian power, after having received to great
afif~tance from it; that he had formed a s~cheme of mae
kring himself matter of some of their cities ; and, under
the pretence of relieving them from the tyranny of
Sparta, intended to fubjeat them to thfe power of Athens.
Xenophon's ~ilence about the fate of Cionon, leaves
room to fixfpeat, that he may have es~caped from his con.
finement. It is certain, however, that we hear no more
of that celebrated commander, who had become the
terror of Sparta, and had so effeaually humbled their
pride, that to accomplish his deftwaioin they descended
to the meanest f~ubmlirons, and to a most disgraceful

peace. W~hen the other Rtates of Gr~eece were informed of
the peace concluded between the Lacedemonians and
the Persian monarch, they were f'eized with th~e highest:
indignation ; and, in the first emotions of their passion,
resolved to rejeat it. Blut, on cooler refleaion, they
perceived, that their domeltic diffenflons had disa-bled
them from maintaining a war with the Persians; and
that, therefore, it was more prudent to acqufifce in the
treaty. In the mean time, mutual hoff~ilities were car.
ried on between the Spartans and Atheniaps; and a
dreadful massacre happened at Corinth, by the initiga-
tion of the Spartans, who, taksing advantage of the di-
viflons prevailing in that city, contrived to get a body
of troops introduced into it; and having [pirited up the
inhabitants to murder one another, their troops, in the
tumult, cut to pieces a great number of the Argives
and Bceotians.

~t Rhed~es, a diffenflon aros~e, in which the Athe·

mtians were confeguenti~ally interested. One half of the
inhabitants having declared for democracy, and the
pDther for arist~ocracy ; the latter applied for support to
the Lacedem7onianas, who nc~ordingly sent them Telen-

tiaU

tins with twenty fi~ips. By this afiftance, arlitocracy
was eflablithed. The Athenians, to whom the fove-
reignty of the island was underflood to belong, in like
manner f~eat thither Thrafy-bulus ; who having, in his
way, levied some tribute in the island of Afpendos, the
natives, provoked by the harth treatment of the soldiers,
joined in an infurreftion, and murdered Thralybulus its
his tent. Thus perished that illuffrious Athenian,
whose zeal and bravery had reffored his country to
liberty, and whose magnanimous behaviour, at that
critical period, intitles him to a place among the greatest
snen of those times.

The Athenians, at this time, entertained the moif:

sanguine expe~tations from the extraordinary merit of
Iphicrates, who, at twenty years of age, appeared to be
a plerfe~k master in the art of war.---The troops left by
.Agefilaus at Lefchea, having been dispers~ed by that:
.commander, the Spartans found it -expedient to make
peace with the Boeotians.

Iphicrates being likewis~e sent to keep in abedience

the towns reduced by Thrafybulus in his expedition to
Rhodes, which were all situated along the coasts of the
flell~efpont, and had, on occasion of the late misfortunes
of the republic, embraced the party of Sparta, laid an
-ambush for the Sparta Anaxibias, and defeated him.

The Eginetae, about the fame time, made an incur-

gion into Atctica, at the infligation of the Spartans who
supported them. But they were opposed by Chah~rias,
and totally routed. The Spartans, however, taking ad-
vantage- of the absence of that commander from Athe~ns,
feat Teleutius against Pyreus, who entered it by fur-
prise in the night, took several thips, destroyed some
o~thers, and created a great deal of confusion and terror
among the inhabitants of Athens.

The Athenians and Spartans,~ weary of e~xert-

ing their utanoft efforts to accomplilh their mu- 3 87*
tual deftru~tion, were at length confirained to
mnake peace with each other, and with Pertia which,
Piy their jealouties and diffentions, was nowN become the

urmpire

rampire of Greece. The terms of this peace, as difta-
' ted by the Persian satrap, Teribazuls, governor of Sar-
dis, upon the suggestion, indeed, of the Lacedemo-
nians, were to this efe~t : That all the Greek cities in
Asia thiould be again f~ubjeated to the Persian govern-
anent; that the Athenianis thould retain their jurifdic.
tion over Lemnos , and that the reif of Greece thould
be free.

Such was the peace of Antalcides, Co called from the

L-c~edemonian of that name, who was the principal au.
thor of it, by comm~idiron from the Rtate of Sparta, in-
fligated thereto by their jealoury of the rising power of
ALthens. In obeying the injun~tions of his conflituents
on this occasion, Antalcides was more than ordinarily
zealous, from his personal animosity against Age~filaus,
who was totally averse to that infamous nego-,ation, by
which the liberty and independency of the Greek cities
of Asia, in whole defence he had lately performed foch
glorious exploits, were to thamefully sacrificed.

How disgraceful to the Greeks the contrast between

this peace, by which Persia deprived them at once of
their power in Asia 1Vinor, and obliged them to aban-
don their countrymen there e~tablifhed, and that made
sixty years before with Artaxerxes Longimanus, by the
Athenian Cimon! Greece then viatorious, not only vm-l
dicated its own liberty, but gave law to the Persians.
The cause of the difference, however, is fufficiently
apparent. It a'rofe for the mutual quarrels of the states
of Greece, of which the Periian monarchs skilfully
availed thems~elves. -Besides, the Greeks were no longer
aftuated by their former spirit of independency. Their
anceffors uniformly defpil~ed the gold, and: rejeaed the
'bribes of the Persians; Now they were no longer
proof against ther~e temnptations, but basely proaituted
themselves to the vilest corruption..-Inft~ead of uniting
against the common enemy, they foolithrly valued them-
selves on their superiority over each other, and ex-
hauffed their force in intestine dissensions, The con-

CHA P fII.

AiFairs of Greece, from the peace of Antalcides, to the con-

clufon of the war of the Aies.

THE differences among the slates of Greece were

by no neans extinguished~ by this peace of Antal-

eides. WNe shall still fee hostilities carried on, not very
intereffing indeed in themselves, but of much import-
ance in their consequences.

TPhe peace of Antalcides having greatly increased the

power of the L~acedemonians, the authors of it, had
provoked against them all the other slates of Greece.
For by that peace the Thebans were obliged to with-
draw the garrisons they held in the towns of Boeotia, as
were the Corinthians theirs from Argos. This was an
effe~t of one maxim of the ancient Spartan policy that
~itill prevailed in full vigour, namely, to keep down by
·every means the power of fach Rtates as were at the time
unable to makre resistance,

From the fame motive, upon complaints being made

to thern by deputies from the towns of Acanthus and
Apollonia, of the too great increase of the power of
Olynthus, they declared war againfit the Olynthians, and
sent an army against that city, under the command of
two brothers, Eudamidas and Phebidas. The first made
himself master of the town of Potidea, then in alliance
with the Olynthians. The other marched to Thebesh-
where finding the inhabitans divided into two fa~tions,
the one contending for oligarchy, and the other for de-
m~ocracy, he took advantage of their divisions, and pre-
vailed on Leontidas, the head of the former, which fa-
Youred Spartal, to put hinx in poffetiion of the citadel.

This

This daring exploit excited an -universal hatred against
the Lacedemonians, who, with a view of softening
matters, depofCed and laid a fine upon Phebidas. But,
by a contradialion, dishonourable to the Spartan juffice,
they kept poffefi~on of the citadel; thus punishing the
criminal, but approving.of the crime.

About the fame time Leontidas, one of the Theban

generals, arrefied and imprisoned in the cit~adel Ifme-
nius, another of their generals, who had declared for
the popular government. The reft of that famton, to
the number of more than four hundred men, among
whom was the famous Pelopidas, alarmed at this vio.
lence, fled to Athens. But Epaminondas living then in
a private flation, entirely employed in the fludy of phi.
lofophyr, remained at T'hebes. The enterprise of Phe-
bidas had ailready occasioned loud complaints; but the
Spartans carried their injuffice to a greater length still,
by sending commiflioners to Thebes, who condenmed
Ifmnenius to death. The Spartan sen~ate must undoubtedly
have been greartly degenerated, before it could attempt
fach open adts of violence and injustice.

The following year the Olynthi~ans cut in pieces a

part ofth~e Spartan army, and among the reft their ge-
neral Telentius. But` this disaster served only to exaf-
perate the Spartans still more, who redoubled their es-
forts to reduce the city of Olynthus, which its inhabi-
tants defended till reduced to the last extremities by fa-
mine. The prosperity of Sparta had never arrived at
such a pitch before ; for they held in fubje~tion the:
most powerful cities of Greece, and punished s~everely
thos~e who attempted to thake off their yoke. The Athe-
nians were too cautions to oppose~ them. But this pro-
fperity being founded on injuffice, could be but of short
duration. Two illutitrious citiz~ens of Thebes were de-
flined to interrupt its cours~e.

Pelopidas, the Birit of there, was very rich. But

though's young man, he applied his wealth to the no-
bleif of purpose~s, that of` afift~ing perfoun of worth op-
prefled by want i and initead of following the pleafu- rable

rable difi~pated life, commonly purs~ued by young men
of fortune, placed his whole delight in bodily exercis~es
and the die of armsi, The other, Epaminonldas, was, on
the contrary, poor. But he enjoyed such perfed con-
trentment in his situation, that he never would accept of
the pecuniary afirltances repeatedly offered him by his
friend EPelopidas. He was besides endued with the
meflt valuable qualifications; being a man of an ex-
cellent underitanding, and of indefatigable a~tivity;) a
brave and skilful commander; exrtremnely a~ddidted to
the fludy of philosophy; and entertaining an utter ab-
horrence to every kind of falsehood, in so much that he
was never guilty of an untruth even in jest.

But, the most: extraordinary circumstance in the cha-

raaters of those two great men, was the intimate friend-
hiSp that, in spite of their very different situations in
point of fortune, and their as different tastes of pleafoure
fabfifted between them, without ever being affedted by
the smallest spark of jealouly. This was owing to their
conne~tion being founded on virtue, untina~ured wkith
ambition or f~elf-intereft. Tfhe sole aim of both was the
glory and happiness of their country.

The Lacedemonians in the mean time were afing their
power still more and more prefumptuoufly.' They gave
the· Athenians a very sensible proof of their domineering
spirit, by commanding them to withdrawt their protec-
tion from the four hundred Thebains, who, upon being
banished by a public decree of their native country, had
taken refuge at Athens. The Athenians, however, had
too much humanity to adopt so violent and s~evere a mnea-
sure against so great a number of Theban citizens;
more especially as these very men had contributed the
Smoft to the refforation of the popular government, of
which the Athenians were at that time enjoying the
advantages. Pelopidas, full of courage, and so-lely in-
tent on the glory of his country, exhorted his fellowo-
fufferers in banishment to take up arms for asserting thl
lib~erty of their native country; an objeat to which every
danger or other personal consideration ought to submit.

He]l

He found all their dlipolitions consonant to his own. E.
paminandas, on his part, in like manner animated the
Theban youth to throw off the Spartan yoke. The ba.-
nifhed T~hebans having accordingly concerted the plan
of their enterprise, corzmunicated .it to their friends at
Tnebes. Twelve of them, with Pelopidas at their head,
dressed like hunters, entered the city at night, and met
by appointment in the-houf'e of Charon, one of the chief
men in Thebes. Philidas, s~ecretary to the principal ma-
giffrates, being in the plot, had that day invited them,
with a view to prevent their getting notice of what was
going on, to a grand entertainment. But in the height
of their feffivity a me~ssenger arrived from Athens, bring-
ing a packet containing a circumstantial account of the
conspiracy. Archias, who was already pretty far ad-
vranced in his cups, on receiving the packet, cried out
laughing, ". Serious affairs for to-morrow;" and, putting
it unopened under his pillow, continued the repast.

The ·conspirators, in the mean timej having divided

themselves into two par-ties, .one led on .by Pelopidas,
dire~ted its course to the house of Leontides ; who being
awakened by the no~ifie, br~avely opposes the conspirators
s~word in hand, and wounds fieveral of them; but un-
able to s~ustain so unequal a combat, is at last slain. The
other p~arty marches against Archias, rushes armed into
the hall where the mag-ifrates were feailing, and eafly
overcomes them, already overpowered with wine. They
next break open the prisons, proclaim liberty, seize
what weapons they can find, and arm all they meet.
~Epaminondas joins them at the head of a numerous
band of youth, and incites them to proceed with all
possible diligence. In these circumstances, the other in-
habitants, ignorant of what is passing, are seized with
the utmost: consternation. The Lacedemonian garris~on,
cons~isting of a 500 men, unacquainted with the fmnall
number of the conspirators, shut themselves up in the
citadel, and fend to demand s~uccours from Sparta.

Next day Epaminondas and Pelopidas, at the head of

the conspirators, ass~emble the people, inform them of

4 what

what had happened, and exhort them to Itand up for
the liberty of their country. The assembly proclaims
thern the refforers of their freedom, and loads them
with univerfal' applaure.

The reft of the banished Theb~ans quickly arrive, and

are soon followed by Scoo foot and 500 horse, sent by
the Athenians under the conduft of Dem~ophon. Several
bodies of troops from the to~wns of Bae=otia likewis~e come
to their affiftane ; so that all their forces united, amount-
ed to ra ,000 men. T~hey immediately lay siege to the
citadel; and the garrison being obliged for want of pro-
visions to capitulate, is permitted to march away. A
reinforcement that had been dispatch~ed from Sparta
arrived too late; and the Spartans, in refeatment, put:
to death the two officers who had capitulated.

This exploit, one of the most remarkiable perhaps

that ever was executed by surpris~e, acquired immortarl
glory to Pelopidas.

T`he Lacede~monians now meditated nothing but re-

venge against Pelopidas and the Thebaans ; for the exe-
cution of which, their.king, Cleombrotus, led an army
into Boeotia. But the operations of the campaigzi were
confined to fa~me ravages of the country. Th`~e Athe-
nians, in the mean time, dreading the resentment of
the Spartans, renounced the league they had made
with the Thebans, and persecuted either by i'mprifo~n-
mnent or bandihment foch of their citizens as favoured
their `cade.

But Pelopidas contrived a firatagem for producing a

quarrel between the Athenians and Spartans. Of con-
cert with Gorgidas, he prevailed on the Spartan Spho-
drias, the commander of a body of troops at Thel~pia,
destined to support the Boeotians who might incline to
revolt against the Tfhebans, to seize Pircus. Sphodrias,
being an ambitious vain man, readily undertook- the
enterprise, although the extreme injuitice of *it was ap-
parent. But not having properly concerted his mea-
sores, his intentions were dis~covered, and his design
mikcarried. The Athenians complained loudly of thlis

attempt:

attempt at Sparta;3 but the son of Sphodrias empoe
his interest so effeatually with Ageflaus in hisfathloeer's
favour, that he procured his acquittal. The Athenians
were so protoked at this featence, that they instantly re,
newed their alliance wi~th the Thebans.

M~uch abourt the fame time fdeveral other cities revolt;

ed fromi the: Spartans ; who, to crowcln their misfo~r-
tunes, loft a great part of their army in the expedition
against Boeotias The famous Athenian Chabrias, wtho,
on account of his fingozlar military kiill, was confidiered
as the only commander fit: to oppole Agefilaus, difiin-
guifhed himself highly on that occafioni H~aving drawn
up his troops after a new method, he boldly offered
battle to the Spartan; whos though he had an armyi
of no fewer than I8,000 men3 was so firuckr with the
excellent order of that of Clhabrias, that he durit riot
verture a battle.

Chabrias gave as firiking prdofs of his~ condult and

bravery at sea as he' had done at land.: He defeated
Pollis, who inrtended to have intercepted some thips
bound to Athens with corn 4 and he co~nduated the
thips into Pireus. Havitig afterwards laid fliege to
Naxus, he beat the Spartans, who came to kelieve the
place, arid dispersed their fleet. The Spartans loft
in this adiozn thirty-two thips, and the Athenians
eighteen. Chab~tias, loaded with spoils, entered Pireus
an triumph.

T'he Athenians, encouraged by this faccer's, eqiuipped

a fleet of sixty fail ; of which they gave the command to
Timotheus, the son of the f~amous Conon, who peri
feftly maintained the reputation of his father. After
laying walte Laconia, he made himself master· of Cor-
cyrra, and defeated the Lacedemonian fleet, commandi
ed b~y Munfippus, who was killed in the engagement.
The Spartans begged alliftance from Dionylius the ty-
rant of Syracule to retake this place, and obtained fromr
him a reinforcement of ten galleys. They were never-
thelefs attacked: by the Ath~enian flect under Iphicrates,

a who

·who had facceeded Timotheus in the command, and
.were all taken. Then the Spartans ordered Agefta~zus
to march against the Thebans. But he performed no
decisive a~tion, having only gained over them a few in-
considerable advantages. The war, however, proceeded
very_ warmly between those two Rtates; every day pro-
ducing some new a~tion, in which the Thebans, being
for the most part fixecefsful, thence acquired additional
courage. This was the objea5 Pelopidas had in view ;
who before he chose to hazardI a general battle, desired
to accustom his fellow-citizens to figfhting. Agefilaus
happening to be wounded in one ofthofe fkirmithes,
was rallied on the occasion by his friends, who told him,
that this was certainly the reward the T~hebans intended
him for having taught them the art of war.

Pelopidas having fallen in with the enemy near Te-
gyra, attacked them without hesitation, though amount-
mng to thrice the number of his men. For he had the
fullest confidence in a small corps of infant ry, which
consisted of no more than 300 men, and was called thbe
sacred band, or troop of friendis, being wholly composed
of the bravest and best disciplined soldiers, united by
so close a friendship, that every one of them was re-
solved to spend the last drop of his blood in defence of
his companion. The Theban horse began the attackr.
The firit thock was very terrible; in the: second, the
Lacedemonian general fell. H~is men, ditheartened by
his death, opened their tankrs to let the Theban
horse: pass. B ut Pelopidas inflantly advancing w~ith ~his
sacred band, completed their disorder, and made so
great a slaughter, that the survivors took to flighrt in the
utmost confusion. Pelopidas derived vast glory from
this battle of Tegyra. Till then the Lacedemonians,
while superior in numbers, had never been beaten; but
now the Thebans deprived thern of that honour.

WThile thus the diffentions of the G~reeks continued

without intermission, Artaxerxes, King of Persia, being
at war with Egypt, had occasion for a reinforcement of
troops. To obtain there, he dispatched ambassadors in-

UJ to

to G~reece, to renew the peace of Antalcides, and to
endeavour, if poiffble, to get every separate city pla-
ced in a Rtate of absolute independence. He according.
ly procured commifironers to be appointed for this pur,
pose by the consent of them all, Thebes having agreed
to the mneafure with much reluatance. Artaxerxes, in
the mean time, engaged in his fCervice 2 o,ooo Greeks
and demanded Iphierates for their general. His expe.
dition, however', having been badly concerted, proved
unf'uccefsful.

Several cities of the Peloponnese, eager to enjoy the

lfibe~rty procured them by Artaxerxes's negaciation, ex,
pelled the governors imposed upon them by Sparta;
who having rendered themselves odious by their tyranny,
were treated with great severity. But at length the
;Athe~nians, by the means of Iphicrates, s~ucceeded in
appeasing those commotions,

At this time there was a profpedt of feeing universal1

tranquillity reffored in Greece. The Lacedemonians
h~ad, in a great measure, renounced thatfuperiority which
they had so long affeated over the other slates; at least
they ceased to exercise it; and the Athenians having
no other objeat in view than to reitrain the exorbitant
pretenflons of the Lacedemlonians, applied themselves
to repair their l~oifes. But this desirable profpe~t soon
vanished; for the Thebans, become pres~umptuous by
their late f~uccef's, declared war againit the inhabitants
of Platea; and having taken both that town and Thef-
pia, entirely demolished the former. This daring ex-
ploit so provokred the Athenians, that they immediately
broke their alliance with them, and this rupture became
a fresh sou~rce of war.

It was at frirt: proposed to terminate all differences by

negociation. But the Thebans, whole natural obftina-
cy was increased by their late f~uscers, thinking them-
selves treated with an unbecoming affeatation of fupe-
riority, returned a haughty answer to the proposals of
the A~thenians, and refused to treat. Pelopidas was

not

not a little inifrumental in promoting the amnbiti~ous
Igiews of his coun~trymen : a work in which he was sup-
ported both by the council and the arms of one of the
gr~eatest men that Greece ever produced, namely, Epa-
Ininondas; whole merit, though then living in a private
fAtrion, sol~ely occupied with the fludy of philosophy,
was soon ditcovered by the Thebans, who, forcing hint
fron his obscurity, placed him at the head of their

anny. In there circuimitattes, Agefiaus having declared to
thes Thebans, that if they had a mind to be co>mpre-
She'nded in the treaty, they must previously reffore to
liberty the towns of Boeotia, 3Epaminondas answered,~
Tfhat with this they were ready to comply, provided the
Spartadns would set them the example, whole preten-
fions to superiority over Laconia were no better founded
than those· of his countrymen over Boeotia. Agefitnes,
provoked at this answer, which plainly showed tha't the
TJhecbrans affe~ted an equality with the Spartans, struck
thir name out of the t~reaty, and conclluded the pea-ce
w~ith the other Rtates without them. This wits equiva-
lent to a politive d~eclaration of war.

Cleomb~lrotus, accordingly, rec~eived orders from the
Ep~ori~. to march into Boeotia at the head of Io,ooo
foo~t and I000 horse. That king flattered himself, that
the Thebans, deserted by their allies, were un~able, to
op~pofe~t him. The Spartans at the' fare~ timne convened
the fbrces of their allies ; who joirred them more from
ne~efi~t~y than inclination. The Thebans, on the other
hand, were somewhat uneasy on feeing themselv~es ob.
liged· to support the controverly by themselves alone.
their forces altogether amounting to but 6000o men,
whfile thecir enemies had no fewer than 24,000. But to
fopply the odds, Epaminondas and Pelopidas fought for
the Thebans. As soon as Cleombrotus arrived on the
ffontiers of Boeotia, he summoned the Thebans to re-
build the cities of Platea and Thelpia, and to set the
other towris at lIberty. Epaminondas made answer,
Tihat the Thebans did not think themfle-lves accountable

'U 2 to

to'any person for their condua. After such an anfwier,
arms alone could -decide the controverly.

The two armies having met in the plains of

37 I. Leuara, Epaminondas immediately offered battle.

The view of an army so much superior in num.

bers as that of Cleo~mbrotus, was fufficient to difcou-
rage the bravelt soldiers; m ore especially as Archida,
mus, the son of Ag~efilaus, had lately reinforced it with
a considerable body of troops levied in Laconia. JBut
this great s~uperiority of the enemy in point of numbers,
'had no other effea upon the Theban army than to in-
spire them with the hopes on viatory so much the
more g-lorious in proportion as it was difficult. Epami-
~nondas drew up his army in an order of battle altoge-
ther unknown before, of which the invention and con-
duat were entirely his own.

Cleombrotus had ranged his army in the form of the

old ~Grecian phalanx-, having his horse difkributed in
Equadrons along the first line of the right wing, where
he him~Telf ·comma~nded. Eparninandas hoped to con-
quer the Lacedemonians, by throwing~ them into difor-
der and coniternation, either by the death or capture of
their general. As therefore it was the left wing of the
Theban army which muff attack the quarter where he
Tought, Epaminondas posted there his heavy-armed foot
and the braveff of his men; and before his firlt line he
drew up the few hors~e he had, to make head.againft
those of the enemy. As he knew with what ardour the
Thebans made their -first attack, he did not doubt that
they would break the Lacedemonians.

One diffculty only remained, but which, to a less

able general, might have proved unsurmountable, narne-
ly, to prevent his troops from being s~urrounded when
they charged. For this purpole, Epaminondas ranged
his rxght wing, with which he intended only to make a
thew of engaging, in such a manner as to have only fix
men deep, while each rank of his left, on which the
wnhole weight of the battle was to fall, was no less than
ffifty deep. Then he suddenly extended his front so as

to flank Cleombrocus, hoping, by that means, to pro-
voke him to advance to s~ecure his flank, and so to dec
tach himself from the main body of his army.

The battle was begun by the cavalry. But thos~e of

the Lacedemonians w~ere soon repulsed; and falling
back on the infantry, disordered the foremost ranks.
Gkeombrotus, in the mean time, perceiving Eparninon.
das's apparent design to flank him, changed his order
Sos battle, intending, in like manner, to extend the front
of his right wing, with a view to surround Epaminois
das. This movement decided the fate of the engage-
ment. Pelopidas, ·who at the head of the fiacred barn d
covered Epaminondas's flank and attentively obse~rved
ever'y thing that passed, perceiving the disorder occa-
fioned· in the Lacedemonian army by the change in its
disposition, inflantly makes a vigorous charge upon
them, breaks through the~m before they could- form
their ranks, and throws them into confusion.

~Epamninandas, at the fame time, leads on his phalansE

to the attack. By his skilful condua, he had already

rendredthe dvatageon Is own fide too great to per-

mit the viatory to remain long in f~uipenfe. The Lace-
demonians, on the other hand, fought as udual with
incredible bravery. Wmherever the danger was great--
eft, thither their bravest soldiers and best officers ran in
crowds. ~They form a circle round Cleombrotus,
whom they defend with their launces and swords ; and
covering him with their bucklers, they s~ustain for a long
while the ,impetuosity of the Thebans, who aim at him
alone. Hfis son Cleonymus, together with his best
oflicers and s~oldiers, having breathed their last at his
feet, the Thebans at length cut a lane to him, fwvord
mn hand ; and he himself, covered with his own blood,
and that of his generous defenders, falls dead at lait on
the field of battle.

The heat of the battle now rages around the body of
the king ; where the Lacedersonians, infligated with
fury and difp~air, exert their utmost efib~rts to revenge
the death of their general and king; and for a long

) T-lU 3 · time:

time spread a dreadful slau~ghter around: but being now
deprived of their commander, they soon fall into difor-
der, and begin to lose courage. Thre Thebans, on the
other hand, fighting under the conduat of Epaminon-
das, who skilf~ully managed their ardour, and repaired
their broken ranks, at length, after the mo~t: vigorous
and obltinate dispute, s~ecured the viaory on their fide.
E paminon das, obfervin g that the violent resistance of
the Lacedemonians proceeded from their desire to carry
off the body of Cleombrotus, thought it was better to
accompifh the total defeat of their army, than to contend
with them for so poor a consolation. 'Wheeling off'
therefore to, attack the other wing, which was already
weakened by the loss of' several of its officers, he cut
the greatest part of it in pieces, and put the reft to
flight. Pelopidas is attended with the fame success
'wherever he fights; and the Lacedemonians, broken
and disordered on all sides, give ground, quit the field
of battle, and retreat, with the sole glory of having re-
fcued the body of Cleombrotus from the hands of the
Stenemy.c

The goodnes~s of the Theban hors~e contributed great-

ly to the obtaining of this vi~tory. They began the at-
tacki and defeated those of the Lacedemnonians, aftrer a
feeble resistance. A~t this period, indeed, the Spartan
cavalry was of little account, being compos~ed of the
horses kept in the time of peace by the rich~er fort of
citizens for pleasure and convenience; which, on the
breaking out of a war, were mounted by soldiers, alto-
gether unacqluainted with the discipline requisite in a
body of horse. The T-heban cavalry, on the contrary,
were excellent, and had already diftinguiihed themselves
in the battles of T'hefpia and Orchomenus, of wlhich
they had acquired all the glory.

TLhe loss of the Thrbans amiounted only to *;oo men,

while the Lacedemonians left on the field of battle no
fewer than 4000 killed, and in that number 1000 Spar-
tans, the flower and hope of their nation. 'Till now
there had never happened among the G~reek~s so bloody

anl engagement, the greatest slaughter, on former ecca-
fions, feldomn exceeding Soo men.

Epaminondas gave himnfelf up with all the ·fondnef's of

the m~ost zealous citizen to the joy of having so com-
pletely defeated the mortal enemies of his country. The
first transport: of his joy was so great, that he could. not
reitrain himnfelf from exulting on account of so mnuch
glory and good fortune. But his philofopshy soon got
the better of his vanity ; though at the fame timne he
freely indulged sentiments of a more rational and just!
delight. For when the highest commendations were be-
flowed upon him on account of his success in this ac-
-tion, he discovered little fenfibiity to the praires lavished
on himfbelf, but declared, ** That his joy arose pritici-
's pally from th~e thoughts of the pleasure which his fa-
** ther and mother would feel from the news of his Cuc-
s' cers." A firiking instance of his goodness of heart,
and of his tender affection for thofie who had given him

`being. SThe newrs of this viaory produced at Sparta a beha-
viour extremely opposite to what might have been rea-
fonably expeated. But in that extraordinary Rtate, hu-
manity itself was sacrificed ~to the love of their country.
The parents of thafe that were slain, congratulated ·with
one another with the highest· appearance of ·joy and fa-
tisfa~tion ; while those who expeaed the return of their
relations ditcovered the deepett dejeaion. TIhis is not
surprising when we reflea on th~e punishment infliated
by the laws of Sparta on those who fled in battle. The
most mortifying dithonours of every kind were heaped
upon them; every body was permitted to firike and
abure them; they durst not come 'abroad, except in.
dirty ragged garments ; and all persons were prohibited
from forming any connecaion with them by marriage or
otherwise. So necess~ary did they think it to punish
cowardice.

The Spartans had still further reafon.to be difquieted,

on hearing that the Thebans were preparing to enter

UT 4 the

the Peloponnese. Agefilaus was then the only~man ca-
pable of dehivermng his countrymen from their extreme
diffrefs. He applied himself therefore to reffore their
courage; and his first care was, to preserve for the pub.
hec service th~ose who having fled in the last engagement
were on th~at account disqualified from s~erving in any
mnilitary employment afterwards, but who were too
numerous to be fubjeaed to all the rigour of the law.
He therefore procured in -favour of the fugoitives a
fuf~penflor of the penal laws just mentioned, TIhen be
made an irruption into the territory of the Mantineans
which he laid waite. But he carefully avoided an en-
gagement.

The' Thebans, on the other band, desiring to profit

by their vi~tory, feat to beg afliftancee of the Athenians.
But that slate did not thinkr it proper to comply with their
request ; for, beings de~sirous that the power of Greece
thould remain properly balanced, they thought it most
advis~able to continue quiet, and for that purpose renew-
ed the treaty with the other Rtates. The Thebans
however, persisted in their opposition; and being joinled
by the E~tleanls, Argives, Arcadians, and even forne of
the inhabitan~ts of Laconia, whole viewis and interests
wtere the famie with th~eir own, they formed a league,
whereby it was agreed, that each- of' thiofe fiates thould
have liberty to govern itself by its own laws.

This new formn of government introduced amnong the

Afrcadians fac'tion and discord, the usual corlncoitants
of fiudden political alterations. The Argives in particu.
lar were diffrafled by the most grievous diffentions. F~or
their nobles, by the infligation of the orator s, who ap-
plied their eloqurence on t-his occallon to the purpose of
itirring up discord and fecdition, havino entered into the
refojlution of abolishing democracy ; the people getting
notice of their desig·n, murdered one half of' the confpi-
rators, and hadl the other formally condemlned and exe-
cuted, the crators themselves being comprehended in
thIs cataffrophe.

Tn the mer~an time feveyal slat~es of G;reece", namielyr the

t~he Phoceans, Locrians, and Eubeans, acceded to the
Th~eban league, on pretence of afif~ting thle Arcadians
and marched into the Peloponnes~e. Thi ocsat
g~ether amounted to 40,000, and when united with thoer
of the Thebans, composed an army of 60,000 men.
This army, under the. command of Epamincindas and
Pelopidas, entered Laconia, where it laid every thing
walte with fire and sword; and advancing to the very
confines of Sparta, created in that city incredible con-
fiernation. Plutarch observes, that in the space of 6oo
years, during which the Dorians had now poffeffied the
territory of Lacedemon, no enemy· had ever before dared:
to invade their territories.

Epaminondas having made good his passage over the

Eur~otas with the loss of a great many men, penetrated
as far as the suburbs. The Spartans, who had never
before seen an enemy at their gates, bec~ame furious at
the fight; and desired inflantly to be led against the in-
vaders, that they might either repulse them, or die on
the spot. It was with the greatest di~fficulty that they were
reitrained from pritting their purpose in execution by
A~gefilaus; who amidst this (torm that threatened his
country with utter ruin, resolved to aB entirely on the
defensive, by all means to avoid a general engagement,
and ·to confine himself to the defence of the town. This
condua excited the murmurs of his fellow-citizens, who
beheld with horror all the country around them in
"lames. But by his firmness and prudence he mainAtain-
ed his authority in all its vigour, and facceeded in calm-
ing their tempers. On this occasion he proposed to re-
flore the Helots to liberty, and to makre them soldiers.
Saxc toufand of them were accoardingly inlifted.

The Trhebans in the mean time endeavoured to bring

the enemy to a regular amion. But AgeTlaus having
very different intentions, posted his army on an emi-
·nence withmn the town, and beffowed his chief attention
on keeping all the passages firongly and carefully guard-
std. Then the Thebans attempted an attack, but were
fepulfed, and many of them slain by a party of 300

Spartans,

Spartans, who failied out upon them from an am~buf.
cade. - The heroic behaviour too of Ifcholas made them
sensible how 'dear it mruft cost them to takre Sparta.
That bravre Spartan, who may be justly compared on
this ocediron with the famous Leonidas, by whom the
whol~e Persian army was for a wKhil~e flopt at the pass of
T~hermopyl~e, had been appointed to the command of
a small party that defended an .important post. But
perceiving that he mirth be overpowered by the enemy,
he sent away the younger soldiers, and at the head
of the reinsijhde~r, sacrific~ed his own life along with
those, of his generous followers in the s~ervice of his
country. Epartlinandas~ finding all his endeavours to draw Age-
Exlaus out of the town inek~e~tual, th-ought it necessary
to retreat : not as is fisppofed fromt a des~pair of being
able, with a little patience, to reduce Sparta, then mna
very defenceles~s· situation, but from an apprehension of
exciting againlt his country the jealousy of the reft of
the Greeks. He contented himtfelf therefore with ha-
ving humbled the Spartan pride, and with having obliged
them to make dfe of a more modefti tone of rpeech with
their ne~ighbiours.

The Thebans retired into Arcadia; where it was re-

solved, in consequence of the advice of Epaminandas
and the confeat of their allies, to re-eftablith in their
ancient poff~effons the potterity of the Meffenians, who
had been 300 years before expelled the Peloponnese by
the Spartans, and were at this time dispers~ed over the
island of Sicily. The Meffenians joyfully embraced the
firfi invitation ; and, after dividing their territory, re-
ceived from the allies a formidable b~ody of troops for
their immediate defence. The Ilofs of this country, the
m~nolt fruitful in Greece, was severely felt by the Lacel
demnonians.

Epaminondas and Pelopidas, on their return to The.

bes, initead of receiving the thanks and applause they
so well deserved at the hands of their countrymen, were
judicially cited to answer for the crime of havmng retalend

ed the command of the army four months longer than
the time allowed by law.l-A law rigorously observed in
the larger republics, from an apprehension, left fomle
man, invefied with so high an authority, might be
tempted to ofe it to the fubverflon of th~e liberty of his
country.--Trhey were, therefore, thrown into prison,
and an accufiftion was exhibited against them; for, as
dfual, their diftingulfhed merit had procured them many
enemies. 3Pelopidas managed his defence like a man
apprehensive of the whimsical inconitancy and ingrati-
tude inherent in the disposition of every people under a
republican form of government. Bult Epamninondas,
whose refpe~table appearance corresponded perfeatly
with the grearnefs of his aftions,- pleaded his cause with
a confidence that affonithied the heaiers. Wniithlout de-
Ecending to a dire&t justification of his conduct, he re-
called to their remembrance all his exploits, and the
services 'he had performed for his country; and declared,
that he would lay down his life with pleasure, if his
countrymen would express in his sentence, that his ha-
ving overthrown their enemies in. the field of Leu~tra
without their consent, was the crime for which he sus-
fered, The manner of this defence reffored the The-
bans to their right reason, and they unanimouily ac-
quitted Epaminondas, upon whom this trial only re~flec-
ted additional glory.

As for the Spartans, their late humiliation, and the

continual alarms to which they were exposed, produced
a change in their difpolitions.-Tlhey began to murdrna
agamint the government ; the city was difkraaed by
faftions; and nothing went on but cabals and confpi.
racies. Ther~e inteffine disorders afforded great oppor-
tunity to Agefilaus to display both his patience and his
prudence. Having gained over the Ephoti to his fide,
and having dis~covered fomre of those conspiracies,. he put
several of the principal ringleaders to immediate death,
and made it capital for any person to be engaged in the
like for the future. After having by there means re-

floredl

fiered tranquillity and order in Sparta, he began to look
abroad for assistance among the neighbouring PHates;
and. he was lucky enough to prevail with the Corinthians
to furnish him with some. auxiliary forces.

Things begin now to wear a differ~ent apspearance in

Greece. W;e shall immediately fee those haughty Spar-
tains descending to implore assistance of the farne Athe-
nians, on whom they had lately insisted all the mifichiefs
in their power, and whose utter· ruin they would have
joyfully accomnplifhed.i-At this time, however, they
found themselves under the necefirty of sending an em-
baffy to Athens, to explain the extremity to which they
were reduced, and to endeavour to convince the Athe.
nians, how much it was their interest to join with thern,
and to flop the career of the ambitious TIhebans, who
seemed desirous of reducing all Greece under their sub-

je~tion. This occafxon furniihes us with a firiking inst~ance of
the generosity· of the Athenians, as well as of their just
dif~cerninent of the general interest of Greece. For
though the misfortunes brought upon them by the La-
cedemonians were fresh in their remembrance, they ne-
verthelefs resolved at once to furnish them with intme-
diate assistance ; and at the fame time they brought
about a confederacy with several other slates to oppose
the Thebans. They refus~ed, however, to take any part
in this war, except upon condition that they were allow-
ed to ac'1 in it on an equal footing with the Lacedemno-
mians, and to exercise the chief command alternately
with them, at the rate of four days at a time each. As
this was by no means a proper season for Sparta to talk
of her su~periorit~y, the conditions proposed by the Athe-
nians were agreed to without heritation.

The Spartans supported in this manlner by their allies,

were for some time in a situation to flop the progress of
the opposite * confederacy. B~ut soon after, the Arca-
dians tookr from them Pallenum in Laconia, put the
garrison to the sword,~ and effefled a jun £ion with the
Eleans, Ahrgives, and Thebaits. The Athenians then

thought

thought it necess~ary to o'ppofe to Eparninondas their
country~man Chabrias, whose troops, when united with
those of the Spartans, compos~ed altogether an army of
41,000 men. Epaminondas, in the mean time, intend-
ing to penetrate into the Peleponnefe, advanced to the
isthm~us, which he found defended by a firong wall. But
discovering one part of it weaker than the reft, he opened.
himself a passage through it after a very warm engage-
ment.. Then he advanced into the country, destroying-
every thing with fire and sword ; and having reduced
Sicyon, he laid siege to Corinth. But Chabrias arriving
in the mean time, put a (top to his faccefs, fruffrated
all the future attempts of the Thebans, and at length
obliged them to depart out of the Pelopounef~e. Epa-
minondas, on his return to Thebes, experienced once
mnore the ingratitude of his countrymen, who accused
him of partiality to the Spartans, and under that pre-
tence deprived him of the command.

The news of the battle at Leuiffra had by this time

reached the exrtremities of Asia, and the success of Epa-
minandas began to give umbrage to the Persian mo-
narch Artaxerxes; to whom an emnbaffy having been
dispatched by the Lacedemonians, the Thebans likewis~e
thought it necessary to fend thither Pelopidas upon their
part.---That illuffrious Theban was gazed upon with
admiration at the court of Persia, where his truly heroic
chara~ter quickly displayed itself, particularly in the eyes
of the king, with whom he became a great favourite.
Pelopidas soon convinced that prince that it was his in-
terest to prote £1 the Thebans, more especially as they
'had never fought against the Persians, and were the
only people of Greece now capable of holding the ba-
lance even :between Sparta and Athens. He further re-
presented, that all his countrymen required was, that
Mdeffene tho~uld be maintained in the poffefiron of its
.liberty; that the Ahthenians thould be obliged to with-
draw their garrisons from the towns of B~eetia ; and
that the Thebans thould be accounted allies of the great
kinig. Thus the negociations of the Lacedemonians at

the

the court of Persia were in a great measure rendered in.
effeanal; for they were able to obtain nothing more
than 2000 mercenaries, with money for their pay. They
procured about the fame time such another reinforce.
ment fromt Dionysius the tyrant of Slicily.

The war Htill went on between the states of Greece.

Archidamus the son of Agefilaus, having received in,
telligence, that the Meffenians were opposing the miarch
of the Lacedemonian auxiliaries from Sicily, marched to
their relief, engaged the Arcadians and Argives, and
obtained a signal viatory, with the loss, as is pretended,
of but a fincgle man. The news of thi-s viatory occasioned
much joy at Sparta, and revived their drooping spirits;
for their defeat at: Leuatra h~ad aff~eted them to such a
degree, that we are told thieir men were aihamed to look
their women in the face.

Pelopidas, on the other hand, by his fkrill in the art

of negociation, daily procured' fresh reinforcements to
the Theban power. Having acquired the confidence
of the princes of Macedon, he was, by the mutual
conf~eat of Perdiccas and Ptolemy the sons of Amynrtas,
chosen umpire to decide the dif'pute that had arisen be-
tween them, about their succession to that kingdom.--
Pelopidas accordingly pronounced his featence; and to
insure the execution of it, carried along with him to
Thebes, by w~ay of hoffage, a third son of Amyntas
called PhSil'ip, who became afterwards the famous king
of M/acedon of that name.

A formidable power, in the mean time, started up in

Thessaly. Alexrander of Pherae having aiffafiFnated Poli-
phron the general of the Theffalians, rendered himfi-lf
master of the whole of t'hat country, and with an army of
no,ooo veteran soldiers made war all around him with
uninterrupted success. The Theifalians implored de-
liverance from their miseries of the Thebans, who sent
Pelopidas to their relief. The Theban general very
s~oon reduced Lariifa, obliged Alexander to sue for
peace, and attempted, by moderation and indulgence,
to inspire that prince with femtiments of juffice and hu-

3 masnty.

·manity. But the excess of deb~aucheryr into which he
had pluznged himnfelf, and his cruel disposition, frufftrated
all the end~eavours of Pelopidas.

Pe~lopidaes having been recalled- int~o Macedoan~ia on

occatio of freth troubles that had B~aroken out there on
the deat~h of Perdiccas (who had fatten in battle), and
which were chiefl~y occasioned b~y Ptolemy's attempting
to inount the throne, raised2 an army of mercenaries in
haste, and marched against Ptolemy. Though Ptolemy
had found means to corrupt many of P-elopidas's fol-
diers; yet, as he flood much in awe of him, he came
before him in a f~ubmnilive manner, and made him the
most sp~ecious promises. Pelopidas thereupon, at the
head~ of -a few Theffaian troops, marched into Pharfalia,
with an. intention to chas~tise those mercenary soldiers
by whom he had been abandoned. Alexander of Pher~e
happening then to be in that neighbourhood with a great
army, Pelopidas ref'olved to wait upon him as ambaffa-
dor of the 'Thebans. But Alexander, feeing him flen-
derly attended, caufetd him to be seized, contrary to the
law of nations ; and having condu~ted him to Pherze,
threw him into prjifon. Pelopidas, though in irons, a-
ftonifhed the tyrant by his firmness and resolution ; and,
upon hearing of his cruelty to the citizens, of whom he
was daily putting some to death, he boldly threatened to
punith him for his wickedness, if ever he escaped out of
His hands. WMhile that illuffrious Theban continued
ubder the most rigorous. confinement, Thebe, the ty-
rant's wife, who had likewis~e abundant reason of dif-
fatisfa~tion with her husband, on account of his infa-
monus debauchery, paid· a visit to Pelopidas, and could
not refrain from buriting into tears on feeing his dif-
mal~ situation.

When the Thebans heard of the unjust seizure of
Pelopidas, they immediately f'ent an army against the
tyrant. But through the unikilfulnef~s of its comman-
ders, this army made but little progress, and wtas con-
tmn~ally harassed by Alexander. Epaminondas happen-
ing to serve in this expedition in the Rtation of a private

of 1ce er

officer, wras intreated by the soldiers to undertakre the
chief command. Overlooking, therefore, the ungrate-
ful treatment received by him from his fellow-citizens,
and ftudyling nothing but the glory and happiness of his
country, he complied with their earnest folicitations.
The soldiers, inspired with extraordinary courage, on
feeing themnfelves condu~ted by so ikilful a general, grew
impatient to come to a~tion. But Epaminondas, appre-
henfive for the life of Pelopidas, which was entirely in
the tyrant's power, protrafted the war, and satisfied
himself with holding Alexander in awe. He even li~ten-
ed with mildness to the ambassadors s~ent by the tyrant to
plead his justification, and in every thing managed him
with consummate prudence, making him s~ensible, at the
fame time, that it was in his power.to chastise him when-
ever he thought it convenient. He kept him therefore
in perpetual alarn; -but offered him a truce of thirty
days, on condition of his setting Pelopidas at liberty.
To this Alexander having codfented, Epaminondas re-
turned to Thebes, happy at having delivered his friend
out of the hands of so cruel an enemy.

Alexander soon gave way to his lierverfe difpolition;

and by his tyranny and opprefi~on obliged s~everal cities
to implore relief of the Thebans, who, at their earnest
desire, s~ent Pelopidas to their affll~rane. But an ecliple
that intervened, prevented many Thebans from accom-
panying~him; and, not daring to contradiat their ridI-
colous f~uperflition, he was obliged to depart with an
escort of only 300 horse. He was incited to this enter-
prise, both by his resentment ag~ainst the tyrant for ha-
ving so cruelly and perfidiously detained him in prifon;i
and likewsife by a desire of ihowing, that the Thebans
were able to overthrow tyranny ; while their enemies,
the Lacedemonians, were reduced to the necessity of
begging afif~tance from the tyrant Dionysius.

Pelopidas with his 300 horse, upon being joined by

7000 men sent him from Thess~aly, marched and pxtched
his camp at Cynocephalus, a place surrounded with
bigh hills. Alexander, who had an army or' 20,000

3~n

aren, on being informed of the great inferiority~o~f the
e'nemy in· point of numbers, marched to give then
battle. Pelopidas's cavalry broke those of the tyrant at
the first charge. But the infantry of the latter, which
wpere, posted upon thae heights, pouring down upon the
Theffalians, obliged them to give ground. Pelopidas
gallopped up with his cavalry to their relief, rallied
themn, and put the enemy to flight. Encouraged by
this foccefs, and instigated by refentmnent against A-
lexander, he advanced up to the ty rant, whorn he hap.
pened to perceive, and, by name, challenged him to
iC n~le combat ; but without effe~t ' for Alexander re-
tired behind his men. Pelopidas, blinded by his fury,
and not reflefting on the danger to which he exposed
himself, nor the duty of his rank~, rurhes upon the
party that s~urrounded the tyrant, and cuts down 364.
all that oppose his passage. But he is instantly over-
whfelmed bir a thower of darts, is thrown from his horfie,
atnd transfixed with javelins. 'The Theffalian horfemert
gallop up to his anllitance, but find' him exzpiring. The
Thebairs, on hearing: the news, are inspired with the
greatest fury ; and falling with impetuosity on the main
body of the enemy, cut in pieces 3000 men.

The soldiers were all penetrated w~iith inconsolable

grief for the las~s of their general, whom, with tears in
their eyes, they proclaimed to have been their father
.and deliverer. In tokeri of their· sorrow, they cut off the
hair of their own heads, and the manes of their horses,
·arid· iihut themlfelves up in their tents, abitaining frorn
every kind of nourifhusient. Trhe magiffrates and people
of the towns through which his body was carried, came'
to~ mreet the procession, bringing crowns and trophies.
The Theff~aians and Tlhebans contended for the honour
of bury-ing him., But the moving arguments employed
by the former prevailed with the TIhebans to yield theux
bat last mnournfurl office.

TIhe friendship of Epaminandas and Pelopidas had

been of long contumnance, and had been maintained
writh perfe~t intimacy and sincerity. TIheir unanimity

X ~in so Te$

insured the faccef~s of all their undertakings; for the
publi~c welfare being the sole objeft of both, entirely
prevented the groveling pafflons of envy and jealousy
front obtaining any footing in their brealls. Epamic
naondas's contempt of wealth excited the admiration of
Pelopidas, who grew desirous of imitating the plain
frugal life of his frienrd. But his application to the bufi.
nefi-s of the slate made him negligent about his own
private fortune, which, by that means, fuffered con-
fiderably. Pelopidas was a~tive, brave, and perf~everingl
wvas esteemed and beloved by the people, and always
poff~effed the greatest influence in the admniniffration.
He aimed at nothing less than rendering the T'hebans
the foremnoft people in Greece.

Thie.Thebans, not satisfied with mourning the death

of Pelopidas, resolved to revenge it. Having with this
view united their forces with tho~se of the T'heffalians,
they- dispersed the remains of Alexander's army, obliged
him to give up all the places he had takren, and to s~wear
obedience to the Theban commands. That tyrant ha-
ving rendered himself deteitab~le by his debaucherv and
cruelty, perished seven years after this period byr the
hiands of his own wife and her brothers.

The Thebans, in the mean time, were solely intent

on profiring by the diffenflons of the other slates to aug-
ment their own power. But their success had now a-
larmedl the reit of Greece,, which was aHl in motion. A
di-spute that arose: between the Arcadians and Mantine-
ans, ~fortiihed ·themn with a pretence for again entering
the Peloponnese in arms. They accused the -Arcadians
of -an intlention to join the- Spartan confederacy; and,
though the Arcadians denied the accusation in the
firongeft termsj yet Epaminondas told ·them, with a
tone of authority, that he w~ould judge of their sincerity
in the Peloponnese. This convinced them that a florm
was preparing against them. They therefore made ap-
plication to the Athenians and Spartains for assistance,
and both those iRat~es concluded with themn an offenfivree
and defensive alliance.

Epar-

SEpaminondas, at the head of the Bceotiahs, and a
'isdy of Theiffalian cavalry, having again marched into

.aiis for ever. It was no other than to push forwards with
.'his army direftly· to Sparta, which he hopled to furptife, ifi
cthe absence of their troops which had marched for Mtanti-
naea. With this view he initantly pute his army in mo-
tion. But Agefilaus, who was then on his march to Me/an-
tinea, getting notice of his intention, posted back tvitli
·inch expedition to Sparta, that he~ found himse~lf in a si-
triation to receive the Thebans ; the few inhabiyant~s whct
had remained at homei difponfin therefelveS in the bieif
maniner they could alonig the different qudartei-s of the
town. Ejpaminondas, however, though difoovered, re-
solved to ala~rm thle Spartans ; and, for that pilrpofe,
httaked t~he town, and penetrated ais far as the market-
plarce. Ageillaus fulfained his attta~ks with wainderful
toolnefs and presence of mind ; and, thatlgh far ad~-
tranced in years, exerted prodigies of personal tralour,
freely exposing his life in defence of his country. In
this, indeed, he was. admirably well Tconded by his son
Archidainus, who comnmanded the youith, anrd thowed
himself Tivorthy su~ch a father : For. having crossed the
Euratas, and taken poffeffion of hdn eminence, he thence
mnade a fuiriouis chafge upon the Thebansi anid put
than to flight.

It was on thiS o~ceaflon that Ifadas, the fort of Phebi-

rdas, a young Spartan bs laige ftatuid and gi-eat firength,
di'lling~itihed himifelf by an exertion of ·extraordinaryr
briavery; Happening to be at home when the Thebans
btioke into the town, and being f~uddenlg alarmed at the
Wif~ie of armour, he instantly fieizes a spear in one hand,
sad a C\word in the other, and ruins out to oppose the
&neiny, Htarkr naked as he was at the time. H-e rush~es

around him with every blow, and overthrows all that
oppose him, without receiving any wound himself.
The E phori decreed him a chaplet as the reward of hils
valour; but, at: the ~fame time, laid a fine of Iaoo
drachmas upon him, as a punishment for having- exposed
~himself without. armour.

Epaminondas finding more refillance than 1xe had

expe~ted, drew off his army from before Sparta, and
marched towards Mantinea, to ~which he resolved to lay
siege. That place happened then to be quite defenceless[;
the allies, who had at firit assembled there, having re-
turned home to takle c~are of their harvest. But, in the
meann time, 6000 Athenians, under the command of
H3regilochus, passed- the sea to join the allies at MIantinea,
and arrived in time to s~ave the place. Falling in with
the Thebans, they immediately gave them battle; which,
though sh~arp, was but of short duration: For, the The-
bans, finding their projeft disappointed, thought it pmu-
dent to retreat.

The Theban general, provoked at having failed in

there two last attempts, an~d fear-in~g to forfeit the confi-
dence of his allies on that account, resolved to come to
a general enga~gement, which might at once render him*
miatter of the Peloponnese.

The T7heban army, comprehending their allies

363. the Arcadians and Argives, amounted to 30,000

foot and 3000 horse. That· of the .Lacedemo.

nians, joined with the Athenian troops and those of
their other allies, amounted to no more than 20,000
foot and 2000 horse. The latter had: but few flizigers and
archers, whoe, besides, were not very expert. The
Thebans, on the contrary, had a great numnber, who
had comle to their afifitance all. the way from the bor-
ders of Thessaly, and excelled in the- use of the fling
and dart. Epaminolndas was well persuaded, that by
gaining this battle, he tho~uld afirure to Thebes a fuperi-
ority over the reft of Greece.

gligeinent, which was fought on the plain of Mantinea,
dras as skilful as it was fingularr. Epam-inaondas, though
f~iperior in the number of his men, omitted nothing that
·might contribute to the success of the ·battle. Never did
he employ more art to decei've the enemy, and to con-
ceal from them his intended order of 6ight, that so he
reight attack them with the double advantage of their
disorder, and his own superior kill.II
- The Lacedemonian army was encamped at the foot
~of Milourit Parthemus; and that of the Thebafts, on the
dect~iv\ity of the fame hill. Epaminandas, without re-
gaiding the order of the enemy, whom he did not
doubt of disconcerting by the singularity of his attacks,
formed his men before moyng: from the place of en-
carnpment. On his left wing, which was deitined to
chargfe the Lacedemonians themfelviers, he potted his
Thebans and Arcadians, being the flower of his· arly :
the ~Argives composed his right; the Eubteans, Sicyo.
nians, and Locrians, occupied his centre; and the ca.
valry was disposed along the wvingbs.

A~fter informing every corps of the order in which it

·was ~to fight, he~ inflantlfy changed his difpoition_, put
his army in motion, and, in a moment, gave it farch a
movement as indicated an intention to march...H~e ad-
vanced, indeed, towards the enemy ; but, from the dif-
polition of his troops, they were convinced that he meant
to -decamp.- Still more to deceive them, after continu-
ing his march for some time, he halted on ah eminence,
andl caused all his infantry to ground their arms. This be-
haviour persuaded the Lacedemnonians, that Ep~aminon-
das intended to pitch his camp. T'heir offi~cers were the
fiirt deceived, and accordingly quitted thecir Rtations ; the
idldiers, after their example, left their ranks; and thus
the whole Lacedemonian army, which had till then
editfnue~3d in battle array, difpekred all over their camp.

This was the effeft that E~paminondas had forese~en
sad expe~ted. As soon as he perceived the lacedemo-
nzans in the disorder of an army quiefly retiring to
thbeir_ quarters, from a belief that there was nothing'

1 3 more

more to be feared, he commands his men to recover
their arms, and advances quickly to 'the attack. The
enemy, mn amazement, run in haste to recover their
ranks, and form with all poflliblee expedition. T~hey
think of nothing now but to aft on the defensive, Epa-
minondaS's troops being already formed, while they
were hardly begun to make their dis~position. Notwith-
-Handing their surprise, however, they threw th~emselves
into the form of a phalanx. The Athenian horse took
post on one wing, the Lacedemonian on the other.
'Their precipitation produced confusion; and, .00 view-
ing the excellent order of the Theban army, they could
expecT nothing but a certain defeat.

One part of the Theban horse had already placed

themfelve$ in front: of that of the Athenians, to overawe
them, and to prevent them from attacking their infantry
In flank. The reft opposed the Lacedemonian cavalry.
Epaminandas had intermirngled among his horse Enlall
parties of excellent TheffCalian flingers and archers, a
precaution which the Lacedemoniatns had negledled.
As soon as his cavalry had taiken their Rtation, Epami-
nondas, W'ho had till now led on his army in the form
of a phalanx, with a single line, suddenly ordered the
extremity of his right wing to halt; and, at the fame
time, advanced briskly with the left wing in an angular
form; with :the point of w·hich, as with th~e beakr of a
galley, to nfe Xenophon's exprefi~on', he charged thle
centre of the enemy.

He had had the precaution to place in this wing his

choicest troops, which were besides sustained by those
of the' other wing; the left extremity of which extended
to the formidable point in which he now advanced.
HJ~is intention was to bear down the 'centre of the Lace-
demonians, and then to charge them in flank to right
aind left, when, after being thus divided, they might be
the more eardly overpowered.

The trumpets hiaving founded the charge, the armies,

as usual, set up loud thouts. The engagement was be-
gun by the Lacedemonian horse; which being much in-

1ferior

ferior to those of the Thebans, were broken at the first·
onset, and put to flight, after making a poor refifiance.
The centre of the enemy was lIkewvife borne down, as
Epaminondas had foreseen. But thtis disadvantag~e, far
from discouraging the Lacedemonians, rather animated
them to exert prodigies of valour, to repair their loSs.

Necver, says Diodorus Siculus, had the Greeks fought

againit one another with s~uch numerous armies; never
were they commanded by more fkcilful generals; snever
bad the~y discovered more firmness, valour, and intre-
pidity. T'hey all entertained the fame indi~fference for
life, the fame desire of glory, the fame love for their
counltry. This battle was now to decide, in the fight
of all Greece in arms, whether T`hebes, conflantly vic-
torious through the whole course of this war; or Sparta,
illuffrious by its triumphs for ages preceding it, thould
enjoy the superiority over the reft of their countrymen.
From all there motives united, the two parties disputed
the viffory with the most~ obstinate bravery.

The foot of both, armies made the first attack witih

their lances. Th~ere being soon blrogken, they betooka
themselves to their sword~s. Thben the aion became
one of the most bloody that had evpr been known;
and the earth was soon covered with the dead and
wounded, and drenched with blooAo Bult in spite of a~l
the precautions ofed by Epaminondas for securing the
viatory on his fide, it still remained doubtful; and he
now saw, that a desperate effort was necessa~ry to insure
the f~uccels of his wif~eit mIreafures.

In this decisive moment, Epaminondas, still further to

animate his men, thought it neces~sary to a~t the part of
a brave soldier rather than that of a cautious general.
)3Lifembing therefore a chosen band of his bravest The-
b~ans, he exhorts them to follow the exainple he is now
to show themn, and then ruthes impetuously upon the
Lacedemonians, determined to sacrifice his lif~e, if he
can thereby decide the fate of the engagement. Fol-
-owed by his troop of Thebans, he drives ·al before

1 4 hiny

him, and cuts a lane through the enemy. The Lacede,
monians in the centre begiri to flagger, by and by give
ground, and at last retirt from the field of battle. Epa-
mmioodas pursued them, and made fouch a slaughter,
that the ground where he and his troop fought, was,
by the account of Diodorus Siculus, covered with heaps
of L~acedemonians.

'To render ·the viatory complete, it was now only ne-

ceffary to recal the viatorious Thebans fitom the pursuit
of those that fled, and to lead them against the virings of
the Lacsedemonian army, which flill kept their ground.
But such valour and prudence are seldom united. Epa-
minondas, impelled by the ardour of his courage, was
no longer matler of himself, and seemed resolved not to
let a single Lacedemonian escape. Having advanced
imprudently into the midst of them, without refleaingr
that his brave troop was every moment diminifyingf, he
found himse:lf at length altooft alone, surrounded by a
cri-wd of Lacedemomians. This brave man, then, col-
le~ting all his firength, supports, with a truly heroic
bravery, the unequal combat, and wards off, with his
biackler, the ihowers of darts poured upon hire from
every quarter. But while he is thus intent on defend.
ing hinrife~lf, an officer makes a puih at him with his
lance, and plunges it into his breast. The wood hlaving
broken, the iron fluck fast in the wound, and Epami-
nlondas falls half dead to the grouild. The news is im-
megdiately spread- throughbt ris The Thebans,

furousforthelof oftheir general, run to the spot

wthere he lay wounded, and bear down all before them?.
A thocking flaulghter prevails ro~und the body of Epami-
nondas, both parties fighting with the most: furious ob-
flinixcy to get the poffefi~on of it. TIhe T'hebans, how-
ever, prevail at last, and carry off their commlander,
though almost without life. Their fury redoubles at
the fight; and they vent it upon the L~acedeanonians,
·who now began to fly on all sides . But the Trheban
commanders, considering that viEtory had hitherto de-
Flaced in their favour, and being unwilling to hazard

their

thdir good fortunle any farther, cauled the retreatg to be
fiound2e d .

Wi~hen the Thebans were retired ,to their camp, the

phyrfician~s on examiining Epaminondas's wound, judged~
it to be mortal; and gave it as their opinion, that he
mulit soon die unless the iron were drawn froam his
brealt, and that it was probable he might expire- under
the operation. Epaminondas heard them with the
greatest calmness; and perceiving that his last hour was
at hand, called for' his armour-bearer, and asked him
whether his shield was safe ? The man answering that
it was; and having thown it to him, a finile of joy im-
mediately overs~pread the face of E-paminandas; who ta-
king· hold of his (hlield, embraced it, says Juffin, as the
companion of his labours and of his glory. He next
inquired, which of the armies had remnained the con-
qlueror ; and, on being affi-red that the Lacedemonians
hadl quitted the field of battle, "L Then (says he), I have
CL lived long enough, fance I die with the honour of
CI having never been beaten."

AiSfter s~aying5 this, he desired the physicians to pull

the iron from his breast. As it was not doubted that
he would clie under the operation, the hearts of all pre,
flein were penetrated with extreme sorrow. In the
midst of this general dej~eaion, one of his most: intimate
friends could not reitrain himself from buriting out into
the followking exclamation; e O Epaminandas ! you
e ·die (cried h~e), you die, without leaving us even the
"' hope of ever feeing you revive in any of your pofte-
"C rity, for you leave no child behind you.", " You
"C are miitaken (replied Epaminandas calmly), I leave
"C behind me two immortal daughters, the viaory of
"C Leuffra and that of Mantinea." The physicians ha-
ving then, with much difficulty, extraated the iron from
his breast, he fainted away. Some hifforians tell, that
he drew it from the wound with his own hand. Wi~hat-
ever may be in that, he expired a f'ew moments after,
its if in the arms of vi~tory, with a fmnile of joy and fa-
i~sfaftion dliffrixted over his countenance.

Cicero

Cicero regards Epaminondas as the completeft cha-

rader of Greece. The advantages beffowed on him by
nature, were improved by the admirable education g~i.
ven him by his father, who entertained to firong a pas.
sion for the arts and sciences, that, in the pursuit of them,
he spent all his fortune. Epaminondas, naturally of a
philosophical genius, preferred the good education given
him by his father to the greatest estate he could have
left him. Master of his paflions, and fond of tempe-
rance and timplicity, he lived happy in a slate of the
narrowest mediocr~ity. The honour of his country was
the motive of his whole conduat; an4, his time was enl
tirely employed about the public welfare and the im-
provement of his underlianding. Though naturally ad-
diaed to the military life, he had fluctied the theory,
before he chose to venture on the pradtice of w~ar. H~is
order of battle at Leuatra and Mdantinea, procured him
the charadter of the most complete ma~ttr of tatics of
his time. That of IVantinea, in pqt~icular, was accountg·
ed the matter-piece of~ this accompliifhed commander.

His countrymen, who till his time had been buried

in indolence and a total ignorance of the art of war,
flood in need of such a matter. By his care and applica-
tion, he at once made them a nation of soldiers, and
put them in a capacity of disputing~ the sup~eriority of
Greece with the people by whom that superiority was
poffeffed. Pelopidas, it is true, had the honour of be-
ginning the work; but` that of carrying it to its perfec-
tion belonged to Epaminondas alone. in the battle of
Lteu~tra, the Thebans, unassisted .by any allies, humbled
the pride of Sparta. Epamninandas, in every encounter,
discomfited those celebrated Spartans, so renowned in
all hiffories, and gave irreparable blows to their power.
He ofed, in jest, to fay, that he had taught them to
lengthen their monosyllables 4 alluding to their lacomec
;answ~ers, the overbearing tone of which had to much
dif~guffed the other Rtates. His integrity was without
exa~mple. He not only himself rejeated, with indigna-
tion, a large fum of money offered by the Persians to

corrupt

cprrupt his ·integrity, but even obliged Micithus to. re-
turzn the money received by him for making the pro-
pofal. In a word, he was not only a skilful commander,
a profound· flatef~man, and a mian of learning and s~cience,
but his virtue in private life refle~ted additional luffre
on all those other thining qualifications.

The views and hopes of the Thebans were buried in
Epaminon das's ,grave. Their thoughts were now entire-.
ly turned to peace; and as their enemies were still more
exhauffed by the war than they, the terms of accom-
randation proposed were very honourable for the The-
Inns.' It was agreed, that each party thould retain
what it had won. The Lacedemonians alone, by thei
persuasion of Agefilaus, refused to. accede to the treaty,
under pretence that it comprehended the inhabitants of'
I3ietrene. They preferred war, there-fore, in the hopes
of recovering that country. A gefilaus was much bla-
med on this occasion, for persuading his countrymen to
persist in a ruinous war, rather than to embrace so fa-
\rourable an opportunity of procuring an advantageous
peace ; and he was looked upon as an obitinate man,
who preferred the pleasure of commanding an army to
the happiness and quiet of hi-s country.

At this time Tachos King of Egypt' being

threatened with an invasion from the Persian mo- 362.
parch, sent to request the afif~tance of a body
of troops from the Lacedemonians, with Agefilaus for
their commander. His request was complied with; and
the world was surprised to fee a king of Sparta, at such
an~advanced period of life, spent in continual allion
and fatigue, submit to s~erve under a foreign prince.
The~ event afforded him abundant cause to repent of his
imprudence. The Egyptians, prepof~feffed with a high
opisiion of Agefilaus, from his great reputation as a
most ikilful general, had figured to themselves a king
of a noble firiking appearance. They were, therefore,
exceeding~ly surpris~ed to find him an old man, of a de-
f~picable figure, and in a very homely dress ; and could
~ardly refrain from insulting him. He exrpeated to

3 have

have had the sole direaion of the war. But he got the
command only of the mierc~enaries, that of the navy be-
ing cominitted to the A~thenian Chabria~s, and the king
retaining to himself the f~uptree dire~tion both of the
ar-my and of the fleet.

Tachos, difiregarding the advice of Agefilaas not to

ad·vanrce too far from his own frontiers, resolved to
usurch into Phenicia.. Agefilaus, provoke~d at this fiep of
the king, joined a fsaion of the Egy~ptians who had
revolted against hire in his absence, and had advanced
Neatenabus to the throne. Plutarch boldly treats this
behaviour of Agefilaus as downright pe~Lrfidy and treason.
BuIt the Lacede~ntoians, from their violent att~achment
to their native country, seldom failed to s~acrifice honour
and good faith to wha~t they imagined might redound
to i-ts advantage. TIo -Agefilaus, therefo~re, it was
ifuicient reason to prefer the useful to the honourable;
that he believed the· fi~de he erxbraced muight better
.promote the .glory of Spar'ta, or that the king for
whorn he declared was more attached to Greece;j ob.
jeats thiat in a. Grecian breast outweighed every other
con fid eration .

T~he prince of the city of Mendes having appeared as

a third competi~tor for the crown, in opposition to Nec-
tenabus, Agefilaus advi~sed to fight hiim imnmediately.
But Neatenabus ~was of a different opinion; of wrhich,
however, he had soon reason to repent. After having
learned, by ex~perience, that Agefi~laus was in the right,

he tougt poper to follow his counsel. Agefilaus

thereu~p~on defeated his opponent, and made him prisoner.
--Having, at length, secured Ne~tenabus on the throne,
he set fail for Lacedemon; but: being driven by .con-
trary winds on that part of the coast of Africa called the
harbour of Menelaus, he there fell sick, and breathed his
last~, at thle age of 84 years. His body was carried. to
Sparta, and his son Archidamus furcceeded him in the
kinrgdom. Agdalaus forms one of the most conspicuous and in-
tereffing charafters exhibited in tche hillory of Greece,

-as inauch ~on account of his personal qua~lities as of the
jer·y imnportant tradafrtions in which he was con~tantly
e~ngaged. Though nature had-loa~ded. him with a deform-
e~d.and ungraceful person, yet his wit and s~pirit procu-
ried him univers~al effeem and admiration. Bred a plain
Spartan, he preserved on the throrie, even to a degree
.of~affektation, the ancient Spartan simplici-ty and aufte-
r~ity·ef life. He always behaved as trhe most zealous
proteator of the laws, to which he himself paid the most
exaft and perfeft obedience. This part of h~is chara~te~r
expcites the highest admiration. The deference and re-
sped t·hown by him on all occasions to the Ephori and
feknate, v'vas at once magnanimo~us and poit~ical, as it ~e;-
enr·ed- to him their confidence and s~upport in all.his un-
deritakings. He poffeffed every qualifica~tion of the most
ikilful genreral; active, brave, fruitial in ithatagems,
cool and intrepid in ac~ion. In private life~his charac-
ter was extremely amiablfe. He was so fond of his· chil-
dren, that ·he fomnerties joined with them even in their
amslfe~ments. H~e Na~s likewise a most: atfe~tionate and
warm friend.--In his old age he became haughty, im-
perious, and more restles~s than ever, breathing nothing
but war ; and he is reproached with having sacrificed
the repose and welfare of his country to his hatred of
the T3iefenians and Thebans. His eul~ogiu-m is written
inr the most masterly· manner by Xenophon.
., A8bout this time died Artaxerxes Mnemon,
king of Pertia, in an .advanced age, and borne 357*
down with so~rrow at the conspiracies formed a-
gainft· his life by his own child2ren, who were become
impatient to possess his throne. Ochus, the most wicked
of~his fans, having procured the affafirnation of his two
brothers, facceeded Artaxerxes in the kingdom. Thiis
Ocrhus· was the worst prince of his race, and rendered
hirnfelf infamous by his cruelty; for he put to death,
without any fecruple, all the princes and princesses of ,his
blood,. and all others who gave him the least uneasiness.
Ochus, on receiving some cause of discontent from Ar-
tabsans gover-nor of one of the provinces of Afa, ~Fen t

, * againfit

ag~ainst him an army of 62,000 men. But the Athed.
riian Chares, ·whom the s~atrap had prevailed on to as.,
~ift him, entirely routed this army with a fmnall fleet and
fome' Greek soldiers. T~he Athenians, intimidated
by the threats of Och-us, recalled Chares. Artabazus,
to supply the place of Chares, obtained of the Thebans
a reinforce'ment of 5000 men, commanded by Pamme-
ries, and with their assistance beat the army of Ochus a
second time. But that prince having prevailed on the
Tfhebans, by means of a large f~um of money, to withi
draw their troops likewIife, Artabazus found himself un-
able to make head against: him any longer, and there-
fore took refuge with Philip king of Macedon.

This year war broke out again between the ~Athe.

nians and their allies ; the islands of Chios, Cos, Rhodes,
and the city of Byzantiumn, having entered into a con-
federacy to render themnfelves independent of Athlens.
To reduce those revolters to obedience, required the molt
powerful forces, and the best generals the Athenians then
po~feifed. On this occallon Chabrias, Iphierates, and
Timotheus acquired great glory. According to Cor-
nelius Nepos, t-hes~e were the last Athenian comma~nders
whos~e names deserve to be perpetuated in hiffory.

Thbe war on the part of the Athenians began with -the

siege of Chios, which was quickly relieved by the allies.
T~dhere Chares commanded the army, and Chabrias the
fleet. C=habrias forced his passage into the harbour;
but being deserted by the other galleys, whose corn-
manders were afraid to follow him, his own was fur-
rounded, and pierced through and through. He ne-
verthelefs obstinately refused to .quit -his thip and fave'
himself by swimming, as he might have done, and there-
fore perished along with her. Chabrias had formerly
acquired a high reputation, and especially when he was
sent to the relief of. the. Thebans against the Spartans.
In an aftion that happened on that occasion, f~eeing him-
self abandoned by his allies, he ordered his soldiers to'
close their ranks, and flooping down to the ground ort
one knee, to cover themnfelves w7ith their thields, and to

extend

extend their spears. In this singular polition he Fuflain-
led the attack of tht enemy, who found it impossible to
brteak his ranks. On that account the Athenians ere~ft.
ed a statue to his ilnemory, in the pollure in which he
then fought.

C~hares f~ucree~ded Chabrias in the comm~and of the

fleet;. But the Athenians finding their enterprise against
Chios proceeding but slowly, relinquiihed it altogether;
and at the fame time fitted orit .a second fleet of do gal-
pCjs, which they ptatt abder the command of Iphicrates,
and of Timotheus the son of the famous Conon. The
A~thenians, by laying siege to Byzantium, obliged the
allies to relinpquifh that of Samos, which they had un-
dertaken about the fame time, and to fly to the relielf
of Byzanrium. A violent tempelt coming on just as
they were on the point of engaging, Ghkares, naturally
a prefumlptuous man, insisted, . riotwithftanding, that
they thould attacki the enemy, contrary to the opinion
both of Iphicrates and Timotheus, who wt~ould by no
means consent to hazsard a battle in such circ~umitances.
Chares, provoked at their refufCal, sent letters to Athens,
in which he complained loudly of his colleagutes ; anti
his powrerfu~l faftion in the city did not fail to support
his complaints. The Athienians having brouight Iphi-
crates and Tirnotheus to trial, iripolfed a fine of a 00 ta-
lents on Tlirotheus, who, on a former orcafion, had
g~ained to his countrymen, from its enemies, no less a
`fim than a 200 talents, without referring the fmnalleft
part of it for himself. This is a remarkable instance of
the ingratitude of the giddy worthless mob that governed.
A~thens.

Timotheus, provioked at to unjust a treatment, reti-
red to Chalcidas, where he ended his days a few years
after. It is, remarked of this illuffrious Athenian, that
it was ·he who completely reffored to his counrtrymen
theiiefuperiority at sea; a revolution indeed which his
Scher'had begun. Ti~motheus was, besides, a man of
great learning, and distinguished himself no less by his
cloquence than by his firong and just taste, for the

sciences.

sciences. The. uninterrupted Iaccefs that attended himr
in all his entrerprifes, drew upon him much envy, and
gave occasion to a piece of painting, in . which Timo.
theus was represented asleep, with Fortune at his fide,
taking towns with a net. I imatheus, piqued at this
ins~ult, maintained, that his success was chiefly owing to
his abilities: And as for the piaure, he obs~erved,
with a great deal of wit, "c If I take town~s while ofleep,
"C what might I not perform as awzeake?" It appears,
however;, from what we have juff now related, that For,
tune wearied at last of in~vifhing her favours upon
him.

Iphierates being like wife 'caledi to fland trial, and not

thinking :it.fuffi~cient to depend entirely upon the force
of arguments, introduced into the assembly a number
of young men armed with daggers; of which they took
care now and then to di~scover the points to the view of
the judges. This new method of pleading his defence
produced all the intended effea~. The judges were in-
timidated, and acquitted Iphicrates. Tefcledfo
fition of the people of Athenls, who always behaved with
the highest ingratitude to their best generals, may, in
a great measure, excute thi~s singular stratagem. This'
capricious ungrateful conduat is li~kewise athlgned as one
of the principal causes of the ruin of their republic;
tho~se men who were poffeffed of abilities to serve the
slate, being often obliged to provide, for their personal
security by a voluntary exsile; by which means Athens
could no longer find generals to command its armies.

To return to Iphicrates.--That brave man had parti-

cularly diftinguilhed himself, when very young·, in a sea-
fight; and his merit soon procured him the honour of
the chief command. No Greek general evrer under-
st-ood the military art better than he. He was extreme-
ly `rigorous in inforcing a firia discipline among his
troops, by w~hich he had made them so expert at ev~ery
kind of evolution, that instantly on perceiving the pjro-
per signal, they performed the motion required. T'hef~e
troops were diftinguiihed from the reft by the name of

i Ihi

-Jlphbiwaians. 'He invented a more convenient fort of
·arms and cloathing for the~ soldiers, particularly by
lengthening their spears and swords. In a word, he be-
lo~wed to much attention on 'the most minute parti~cular
relating to -the busines~s of war, that he seemed to h~ave
been expressly formed by nature for the profeflion of
arms. He was endued with such firength of body, that
once its1 a f~ea-engagement he seized his antagonist in his
arms, and carried him, armed as he was, into his own
thip.~ He is said to have been of mean extral~iop. But
his sentiments were far from discovering any tinaure of
a low birth. Never indeed did any man poffers -a- more
lofty foul ; and his son Meniftheus thought himself more
honoiured by being descended of such a father, than -by
having a prin~cers, the daughter of Co~ty k~ing of Th race,
soir his mother. Iphicrates, on being upbraided with
~the meannels of his birth, by one who was defden~ded
of Harmnodius, answered, "L It is true the nobility of my

he was accused of having abandoned the service of the
republic, but had interest enough to screen him from
the painifhment he deserved. The Athenians, dreading
the resentment of the king of Persia, beitirred themn-
selve~s to bring about a general peace, to which they had
been long exhorted by the excellent orations of Ifbecra-
tes; who, recalling to their remembrance the glorious
day ·of Athens, when their anceffors sacrifi~ced every
consideration to the maintaining of the liberties of G reece,

TranfaEions in Greece, from the conclujion of the -war of

the Aies to the death of Philip Kiag· of Afacedon.

THE Athenians, now finding themselves in security
Sand leisure by the peace just concluded, gave

loose to their pleasures, and particularly to their incli-
nation for public thows and diverflons, which they car-
ried to the hiigheft pitch of extravagance. Pericles had
been very infirumental in inspiring them with this taste,
principally from political motives, to please and to amuse=
his restless countrymen, that he might acqizire their as-
fe~tion, and divert them -from caballingf against his ad-
Ininiffration; and partly' from a natural elegance of
Imind, which rendered him partial to an amusement at
once ~the most rational, ingenious, and infiruaive, that
ever ~was devised. B~ut the incomparable dramatic pie-
ces which graced the Attic flage had at length so be-
twitched the imaginations of that lively people, that they
became fond of them even to folly; and to the gratifi-
;cation of their theatrical taste they fiacririced the glory
and business of the slate. The poets and comedians be-
came the idols of the people; and by engrossing the
whole public attention, made thos~e who had exposed
their lives Ifor the interest of the commonwealth to be
quite overlooked. -The public money was lavished away
upon buffbons and fingers; and the annual expence of
the theatre alone exceeded that of an o'rdinary camlpaign.·
To s~upport those foolish extravagancies, they appropria-
ted the funds set apart for the exigencies of the slate,

pro-

hibiting at the fame time, undier pain of death, tvery
person from propoling any_ other application of those
funds. A people to obstinately blind to its molt inxpor tant
.interests deserved to be chastised for its folly, by beco-
Ining a prey to fame of its more virtuous neighbours.

Whiile the Athenians, and after their example most

of the ot~her Gree ks, gave themselves up in this manner
to luxury and pleasure, the Macedonians, till then an
obifcure nation, formed a design of profiting by their
lethargyj and meditated the conqueRt of their country.
They had been always regarded as barbarians by the
Greeks, who continued to give them that appellation
till they had cirried their vi~torious arms into Asia. ~The
'-defcenderits of C~ar~nus, the first king of Macedonia of
whom we have any knowledge, had reigned without
interruption in that kingdom dowrn to the period of
which we now f~peakis

'We have mentioned above, that Perdiccas, the son of

Amyntas, having mounte~d the throne, a dispute on that
hea~d had arisen between him and his br~other Ptolemy,
which by mutual consent was referred to the judgment
of Pelopidas. The matter was by Pelopidas decided in
favour of Perdiccas: and the more effeit~ually to en-
force his decision, Pelopidas carried along with him to
Thebes Philip the third son of Amyntas, then a boy
about ten years old. This happened about the year be.
fore Christ 37 3-

·,Phiilip received his education in the family of Epami-
nondas; and, to the misfortune of Greece, profited but
too well by the lessons of that great matter in the art: of
woar.. From the manner in which he opened his way to
the throne?, he soon displayed a genius capable of the
~greatest undertakings.

He~ had remained now ten years at Thebes, when hre

got notice that Perdiccas was slain in a battle with the
Illyrians, and had left behind him an only son, Amyn-
tas, yet an infant. An ambitious mind has its attention
cconfantly fixed upon the means that may condua to its
objeft. Philip withdraws in secret from Thebes, ar-

to his nephew, and in that quality ~affmess~the govern-
ment of the kingdom, The MP~acedon~ians having been
lately worited in war, were now fourrounded with ene-
anies, who were making dispositions to profit by their
misfortunes. Philip therefore immediately applied him-
self to reanimate their courage, to gain the affec~ion of

th~e people, and to difctipline the troops. The

g do. agced~onians, full of admiration of his great

qualities, deposed his nephew, and advanced

him to the throrne. Philip, then about twenty-four years
of age, hastened to fulfil the public expetations. The
talent of speaking, which he already .poffeff~ed in an el
ruinent degree, gained him universa~l confidence and as-
feraion.

H-is firti care was t~he irefforation of military dis~cipline,

a point upon which he showed hims~elf extremely severe.
But at the fame time, to induce. the fioldiers to serve
with greater zeal, he treated them in other refpeats
with singular kindness and di~ftindion, usually calling
them by the flattering name of tompa~lnions. It was

twenty-three feet long. This phalanx presented an im-
penetrable rampart, and marched so close as to be able
to f~usain the most violent thocks of ~an enemy, and at
the fame time to bear down every thing that oppof~ed'

'battle with PEerfeus, the last: king of M/acedonia, was
opposed by s~uch a phalanx,. declared, that be had ne-
vaer seen any appearanrce .more capable of firiking ter-
ror, and had even trembled at it himself. B~ut as this
Ibody was under a necefi~ty of moving altogether, its
firength consisting entirely in its union, it always re-
quired a plain field to a~t on, otherwis~e it was no longer
anymncible.

ni-an- power, .he endeavoutred to usegociate a treaty with
them, aird succeeded. But this treaty was of thort con-
tinuance, as we fball by and by fee.-Tr~o return- to
ACthens.

In that city ·a man began about this time to appear,

whose extraordinary merit was soon to make a great si-
gure in the affairs of Greece. By the extent of hi~s ge-
ni~us, and the power of his eloquence, he was destined
often to fruftwate the designs of Philip, and ·to be a con-
tinual check upon all his enterprises. This was the fa-
mous Deuxofthenes. It is proper ·for a mo~menlt to fi'2
our particular attention on this wonderful man.

He was born at Athens, in the .yetar before Christ

3.82, two years after Philip, of a father by trade a
blacksmith, but one of the most considerable in his proL
feflion. H~e was left an orp~han very young. H~ap-
pening to~be a witness of the applause beffowed on the
orator Calliffratus, he conceived a violent desire to aci
quire glory by the fame means, and dedicated himself
entirely to the fludy of rhetoric. His voice was -weak,
aibd his articulation confused,- Itammering, anld indi-
finat. He had a difagreeabl'e tone of declamation;
and a person void of all those exterior advantages,
vehic~h are calculated to preposses~s the favour of an au-
dience, and which pave, as it were, the way to per-
fe~arton. Those imperfeations would have prevented
any other person from pursuing the career of public
speaking. But Demofithenes refblved to exert his ut.
trioft efforts to overcome them; and for that purpose:
employed the most painful expedients; sometimes de-
chaiming while climbing up sleep places, in order to
firengthen his voice ; and sometimes profiting by the
advice and example of the principle comedians of his
time, friom whom he learned the graces of amion.
'It is true, that in other refpeats he had received from
nature fomne of the happiest difpolitions for a public
(pea~ker. H~e poffeffed an accurate taste for all the refine.

polition, and extraordinary ingenuity in argument -

QLu~alitieis mdeed that lily most: others natural to man

may be extermely improv'ed by b~xercife,, and which the
uncomnmon application of Demo~sthenes carried to thei
highest pitch. Of this his admirable orations exhibi
-the most complete proof.

It was not long befoi-e he reaped the fruit of his ob.

ftinate apphication. The fame of his eloquence drew
people from the extremities of Greece to hear him
and he soon flood unrivalled among his own country
mnen. His- eloquence was s~erious and correRt; but with I
sublime, bold, and impetuous. fiis orations abound
with metaphors and allutions. He invokes the gods,
the (Lars,- the manes of those who fell at Marathan and
Salamis. But the force of his aCEtion conflituted his
chief chara~teriffic. The times required such an orator.
The ALfthenians, absorbed in the most supine indolence,
and consuming their time in private contests and jealou-
~Fies, required the firongeft and most firiking afgures of
rrhetoric to route them from their lethargy, and to open
their eyes to the dangers by which they were threatened.
The argiuments of Demosthenes made the deeper im-
prefiion, as an ardent zeal for the welfare of his coun-
try, and a perfeft disinterestedness, were well known
to be thle motives and principles upon which he zactd.
3Demades and his other rivals ofTed to tell him.·1 by wfay of
reproach, that bxs difcrourf~es fmnelled of the oil aind lamp.
But Diemofthenes very properly replied, That it were
diii·fre~fpe1fu to a full assembly of the citizens, to pres~ume.
to speak in their presence without being properly prepa-
red. To~ return to the affairs of Greece.

Two years after the war of the allies, the~ ex raordir

nary warlike preparations of the Persian mionarch alarm-
ed the Athenians, who were incited by their orators im-
mediately to take arms, and to commence hoffilities.
43ut D~emosthenes, who, though then only twenty-eight
years of age, was beginning to diftinguilh himself, re-
preferited to the Athenians, that they ought to do no-

,thing

thing rathly, nor by a premature declaration of war- to
furnish so powerful a prince with a pretext for turning
his arms against Greece. In the mean time, however,
hi: advised them to fit out a fleet, and to hold all their
troops in readiness.

The L~acedemnonians abou't this time conceived the

design of making themselves matters of Megalopolis, a
fortified town of Arcadia, which gave them much un-
easiness. On that occasion Demosthenes again haran-
gued the Athenians in favour of the PMegalopolitans,
He convinced them, that it concerned them very nearly
to prevent both Sparta and Thebes from becoming too
powerful: and his eloquence had the effe £1 of deterrmi-
ning the Athenians to fend 3000 men to the relief of that
town, notwfithftanding the alliance that then fubfiftect
between them and the Lacedemonians.

Philip having made the necessary preparations for war,

defeated the Illyrians in a pitched batt'le,~ and redic~ed
Amphipolis, an Athenian colony. As he could not
keep polfeffion of this place without provoking the Athe-
nians, with whom it was at present his interest to keep
fair, and being unwilling. at the fame time to leave in
their hands o~ne of the key~s of his kingdom, he resolved
to declare it free ; and accordingly grannted permiffionn to
the inhabitants to form themselves into an independent
republic. Shortly a'fter, however, by means of his in-
fluence within the town, he made himself matter of it a
second time. But it must be confeffed, that this was in
a great measure owing to the negligence of the Athe-
nians, who were too dilatory in sending: troops to its re-
lief. H~e likewise reduced Potidea, and dismissed the
A~thenian garrison which he found in the place. But:
itill pretending to be desirous of avoiding a rupture
with the Athenians, he ofed every art to lull them into
security with refpeit to their real interests. Soon after
he faubdued the Peonians, and recovered from the Illy-
rians the places of which they ~held poffeffionn in M~ace-
donia.

a44 Philip

thrilip fioen showed himself to be a thorough politi-

cian, by putting in pra~tice every resource of that art,
to cat~end his conqueits; sometimes em~ploying firata-
gems, sometimes promises;- we'akeninrg those whom he
could not conquer, and insinuating himself into the
quarrels of Greece under the chara~fter of umpire, A-
bout this time he got poffeffion of Cnidios, which he
called after his own name Phbihppi. T~he taking of this
town, which became gery famous a long while after by
the battle fought in its neighbourbood, in which ]Bru-
tus and Caffxus were defeated', was more advantageous
to Philip than the greateRt conquest. For having, difico-
vered some gold mines in its neighbourhood, he caused
them to be opened, and drew from them yearly about
roao talents; a furn exceeding the whole revenues of
Athens. Wmith this money he found himfellf in a fitua-
tion to keep up a powerful army, and likewise- to main-
tain spies and partisans am~ong the nations around. This
gold opened him the gates- of many towns, and accele-.
rated the fuiccefs of all his enterprises. H~e is even re-
ported to have declared, that he believed no town im-
pregnable, which could admit the entrance. of a miule
loaded yrrith gold. On this account his gold is said to
·havTe s~ubdued Greece.

Tlhe 1At-henians were not: at this time in a situation to

watch over th~e enterprises of Philip, being en~agred in a
coriteft to which the island ofEubjaa had given occafian.
That island was dflturbed by two factions ; one of which
]favoured the- T~hebans, . and the other the Athenians.
The matter wPias of importance to the latter, who derived
a part of their revenues from Euboes. T~hey therefore-
sent out a fleet, expelled the Thebans, and put an end
to th~e dissensions.

In the year before Christ 356, Olympias, the

856. wife of Philip, brough~t him a fou, who was na-

medd Alexan2der, and whos~e mighty exploits pro-

cured him in the s~equel the appell~ation of thSe Great.l
It is remarkable, that the fa~mous temple of Diana at E-
phelixs, -accounted one of the seven wonders of the

worlITd,

world, wnasburnt the f~ame day that Alexander the
;Great was born. The. person who se~t this superb edifice
oril fire was called Erofi~ratucs. When put to the tor-
tuch~ he deplared, that his motive for committing so
milchievlous an a~tion was to immortalize his name.
Philip was from home when his son was born. At the
faame time that he received this welcome piece of news,
intldlig ce of two other parrticulars of the most agree-
ab~le·n~ature . was ilie;wife brought him, namely, of his
being vijrfor in the chariot-races at the Olympic games,
and of a iganal viatory obtained over- the Illyrians by his
general Parmenio.

Philip being r-efboled to have his son educated in the
moll perfeat and complete manner, instantly wrote to
the famous Aristotle in these terms: "C I give you no-
- r tice that I have gotten a son. I thank the gods, not
r( so much for beffow~ing this son upon me, as for ha-
rC ving bess owed him in your time ; for I have reafori:
"L to flatter myself, that you will form for me a fucceflor
"C worthy of me.",

T~Lhe sacred war, or the war of the Phoceans,

fazcceeded that of the allies. It became genera~l 355*
among the slates of Greece, was carried on for
ten~ years wirth great animosity, and was extremely de-
ftrhuffive in i~ts consequences to all the parties concerned.
Religion was the pretence for it; and the cause that
produced it was very trifling. The Phoceans having
tilled a piece of ground belonging to the temple of A-
polls, which was situated in their territory, were acco-
f~edzof sacrilege by their neighbours, and were cited to
answer for their conduat before the AmphiAyons, who
condemned th~e Phoceans' in a large fine. The latter re-
fused to com~ply with this sentence, alleging that they
were in~titled to the exclusive management both of the
temple and its territory : amd they applied for aid to the
S-partans, who~ furnished them underhand with money,
and encouraged them to persist in their obstinacy.

Philomelus, a man bs a daring spirit, who poffeiFed

great influence among his countrymen the Phoceans,

- pe r-

persuaded them to take arms, levied troops, seized on
the temple of D~e 1phos, effaced the .decree of the Am.
phiayons, which was engraved on a pillar of the temple,
and by threats obliged the priefief~s of Apollo to give a
response approving of allshis proceedings. The Locri.
arts atte-mpted to oppos~e this enterprise of the Phoceans,
but were worited in several encounters. The matter
now became ferious.--The Amphity-ons assembled, and
past a decree, declaring, That war ought to be made on
the Phoceans. Each Rtate of Gree~ce immediately took
.part in the dispute, according as their different interests
inclined them. The Athenians and Spartans joined the
Phoceanls : The Thebans, Locrians, Theffialians, and
the reft of the Rtates, took arms against them. Thus be-
gan the sacred war.

Philomelus, notwithstanding an oath he. had sworn

not: to meddle with the treafore of the temple, took
thence what money was necessary for the expences of
the war, and raised an army of 10,000 men. At first
several engagements were fought with various success.
But this war, like every other of which religion is made
the pretence, where, under colour of religious zeal,
parties· indulge private resentment, was carried on with
great cruelty. The Thebans, the most satige and zeal-
ous of all, having surprised a party of the Phoceans,
condemned them all to death as guilty of sacrilege.
On the other fide, the Phoceans, in revenge for this
cruelty, thought themselves intitled to tr'eat in like man-
ner such of their enemies as fell into their hands. At
last a battle ensued between the Phoceans andc the The-
bans, in which the former were defeated with g-reat
slaughter, their general Philomelus being killed on the
spot, after behaving with a bravery that ihowed him
worthy of conduating a better undertaking. His bro~-
thier, Onomarchus, succeeded him in the command; as-
~femb~led the remains of the Phocean army·; and by the
temptation of high pay, soon raised a formnidable army,
with which he made himself matter of s~everal places be-
longing to the enemy. The

The order of time requires, that we thould here di-

grefs a little, to makre mention of. Artemisia queen of
C~aria, and wife of M~aufolus. That prince had fubjeCft.
ed to his power the people of Rhodes and of Cos, very
soon after they had been by the late peace reffored to
the full enjoyment of their liberty. He is reported to
have treated the conquered people with great severity,
and· to -have died the year after his conquest. But the
grief of his widow Artemifa, and the sumptuous tomb
eretted by her to his memory, have immortalized the
names both of the husban~d and of the wife. NJot f~atis-
fled, however, with honouring him in that manner, the
had his athes carefully preserved and constantly mixed
with her drink, till at last her bodyi became literally the
sepulch~re of thiat of her husband. She desired funeral
orations to be composed to his praise~, and publiihed a
reward to the person that thould furnish the best. It is
said, that the oration presented by Theopompus was
preferred, though his matter Ifberates was one of the
competitors. The grief of Artemisia continued till her
'death, which was thereby hastened, and happened
two years after that of M~aufolus. Some authors, howr-
ever,. tell us, that Artemisia was not so entirely occupied
with her mourning, but that the found time to make
considerable conqueits. For the surprised the fleet of
the Rhodians, who had reso~lved to attempt her
dethronement; obtained poifeflion of Rhodes, 352*
andqput to death the principal inhabitants. Hence
tod authors have taken occallon to call in quellion the
particulars related of her grief. But it is pofirble for
the fame person to be at once poffeffed of very tender
feelings, and of the resolution requisite for maintaining
his authority, and chast~ising his enemies. It was on
this occasion that the Rhodians applied to the Athenians
for alirftance; and Demosthenes having become their
.patron,. endeavoured by his eloquence to excite the
compafflon of. his countrymen in favour of that people,
whole manners had rendered thnem unworthy of being
Jprltefied.

Philip

Philip at firlt took no part in the sacred war. Being
more concerned about his own private mnte~refts than
about the insult ofFeredE to Apollo, he was not at all
diffatisfied to fee the Rtates of Greece ~weakeping each
other by a cruel and ruinous war. Whbile therefore
they were deltroying one another, he was solely intent
on extending his dominions, s~ecuring 'his conqueits on
the fide of Thrace, and reducing fach places as were
advantageotify situated for him., When befiegingMe-
thone, a citizen of Amphipolis, namned Afl~er, offered
him his ~e~rvice as to expert an archer, that he never
miffed the smallest bird. on the wing. But Philip told
him, he would employ him when he had a war with the
[wal lo ws. T3he man wPas to prorvokred at this answer,
that he threw himself into the place, aimed at Philip an
arrow, with this infeription, "S For Philip's right e'ye;"
and in effeft pierced that eye. Phlilip returned the
arrow, with this other infeription, IC f Philip take the
CL town, he will hang up A/Zer;"' and having taken the
t~own accordingly, he was as good as his word. After
this' accident, that prince was weak enough to be offend-
ed when any person happened in his preflence to men-
tion a Cyclops.

Lycophron, brother-in-law to Alexander of Pher~e,

having succeeded that prince in the kingdom, imitated
his tyranny, and provoked his fubjefts to rebel. The
Theffalians applied for proteftion to Philip; who being
otherwise well dis~posed to oblige them, immediately
went in pursuit of the tyrant, and defeated -him in several
engagements, Onomarchus, in the mean time, the general of the
Phoceans, ·was more f~uccefsful- than his brother, and
had taken several .cities in Boeotia, the Thebans being
unable to make opposition. He was even daring enough
to make head against Philip in his war on Lycophrou,
and defeated him in two fkrirmithes; btit a general en-
gagement having ensued, 6000 of the Phoceans were
slain, and the reft put to flight, Onomarchus was
among the killed and Philip took Sooo prroners

asides other advantages that accrned to Phiip from
thbis vi~tory, it procured him the ch~ara~t~er of a prince
'devoted to the interefCts of relig~ion.-H·lis faccef's was,
inra great measure, owing to the Theffalian horse that
fought- in his army.

P:~haill-us, the brother of Onomarchus, facceeded to
th~e corm~mnd among the Phoceans; made use of the
riches of the temple of D~elphos, as his predeces~sors had
done, to raise new forces; augmented Htill further the
payof the soldiers, and by that means increafed' the
num~betr zof his troops. 'He was at first unfuccefsful a-
gainit the Thebans ; but for that his advantages over
the ~Locrians made amends. Death, however, soon
flopt his career ; whereupon a son of Onomarchus,
nramed ~Phtaaeiucs, afixumed th~e command. But his au-
thority was of thort tduration. H~e selF -in his first en-
gagement.
i Hofiliiities, in the mean time, daily continuing, the
Thebans were the firit who grew weary of the war; for
their finances being at length totally exrhauffed, they
found ·themselves unable to support it any longer. The
Phoceans, on the other hand, were ~seized with remorfde
for having authoris~ed their generals to plunder the temple
of apollo. On an account being drawn up of all the
moneyr they h~ad thence abitrafted, the whole fam was
·found to amount to Io,000 ·talents.

A·bout the fame timeithe Phenicians, provoked
by ,the cruel oppression with which they were 35 I.
treafid by the fCatraps, entered into an alliance
wvith Ne~tanebus king of Egypt, revolted against the
Persian monarch, and with the assistance of 4000 Greek
troops, sent to their aid by the king of Egypt, under
the -command of Mlemnon the Rhodian, facceeded in
expelling, the Persians from their country. The inha-
bitants of C'yprus, who were as much oppressed as the
Phienicians, joined the latter in the revolt. Ochus ap-
plied to the Greeks for afifitance to subdue the rebiels,
and obtained 8000 men under the command of P~hocion
the- Athenian, and Evagoras the son of Nicocles. There

t'wo

two brave captains, on being joined by a body of Syrian
'and Cilician soldiers, formd the siege of Salamis, the
most important city of Cyprus.--The army dispatched
by Och~us against Phenicia, consisted of g oo,ooo foot
and 30,ooo horse. Memnon, intimidated by the ap.
proach of so powerful an army, entered into a private
treaty with Ochus, and offered to put him in poffeflion
of Sidon. The Sidonians, to the number ·of 40,ooe
person~s, finding themselves betrayed, thut themselves
up in their houses, s~er fire to them, and perished in the
flames. The reft of the Phenicians, terrified by the
dreadful fate of the Sidonianls, immediately made their
rfabmifiTons to the king of Pedfia.

Ochus having terminated with equal success the re-

bellion of the Cyprians, marched next into ]Egypt, which
he resolved likewise to s~ubdue ; and he was so effeaually
served by his generals, that he completed the conquest
of that kingdom in a very short time. · Nedanebus, ap.
prehetnfive of falling into the hands of the viator, fled
with his army into J~thiopia, from whence he never re.
turned. Ochus, acfter dismantling the cities, and pillar
ging the temples, returned in triumph to Babylon.
Miemnon the 'Rhodia~n, and his brother M~entor, after
their re'conciliation with the Persian monarch, rendered
him very important s~ervices, efplecially Mlemnon, who
was an excellent commander.

Ochus spent the reft of his life immersed in indolence

and pleasure, comlmitting the whole management of
public affairs to the eunuch Bagoas an Egyptian. That
favourite, provoked at his master for having polluted
the Egyptianr temples, and for having killed their god
Apis, which was no other than a sacred bull, in re-
venge deprived him of his life by poison. . The eunuch
finding himself, by that event, invested with the whole'
power of Persia, advanced to the throne Arfes the
youngest of the late king's sons. But perceiving that
young prince to discover some uneasiness at finding
himself to be- no more than a titular king, ]Bagoas got

.Adnhus .
k·ifhilip, who was constantly attentive to every - cir-
runiR-ance that might turn to his advantage, perceiving
thelitates of Greece to be greatly weakened by their in-
teftine wrars, resolved to attempt the conqiueft of them.
~ih that view, he led an army towards -the country of
Phoc6is, and,- for the ~first time, entered Greece with ho-
Allet intentions. The defile of Thermopylae being the
onil~y pass by which he could penetrate into Achaia, he
endcealvoured to take poffefEon of it, under the pretence
ofji-narching against the Phoceans. But the Athenians
having prevented him, he did not think it advisable to
for~ce the passage, and therefore relinquished the projeat
for t:h~e pres~ent. .

P'·hlip owed his disappointment, on this occasion, to
the:eloquence of ,Demolthenes, who routed the atten-
tion, land animated the courage, of his felksw-citizens by
a celebrated oration. The Athenians, now wholly ta-·
ken up with their games and ihows, as we have already
rermarked, had occasion for a man, of such discernment
and prudence, of foch prerf~uatve eloqueixce, and adtua-
ted by To sincere a regard for his country, as this fa-
mouls orator was, to rodre them from heir lethargy.
DIemofthenes made them sensible of the danger they raix
fromn the exorbaitant ambition of Philip, who was con-
tinually employed about s~ome new enterpris~e; and he
persuaded themn, that the success of Philip's arms was
altogether owing to their indolence and inattention.
" While, therefore, (said he), you spend your time in
" ~walking about in the forum, inquiring at one another
('* What's the neros ? what more wonderful a piece of
"C news would you defilre, than that a Macedonian is
"L making quick advances towards obtaining a fuperi-
" orit~y over the Athenians, and becoming the sovereign
8 .arbiter of G~reece ?" He proceeded to lay before them
the proper means for checking the progress of Philip.
He adviled them to fit out, with all convenient [peed, a
fleet of fifty galleys a to muffer up as great an army as

possible

poffble from among themselves; to.take into their pay
as many foreign troops as their finances would allow;
and con~fantly to kieep up an army of observation on th~
frontiers -of Macedonia, to harass Philip, and to hold
him ine awe. To convince them of the expediencyt and
possibility of complying with his advice, he entered into
a very minute detail of particulars, and, on the whole,
laid before them the most ofeful and salutary in-
itrual~ons.

W~hil~e the Athenians were deliberatinig about putting

lefpont; and, biy thus increasing his power, w.as in a
manner paying the way to the accompptifhment of his
designs on Greece. Having at last laid siege to Olyn.
thus, a city poffeffed by an Athenian colony, the inha-
bitants implored the proteai~on of the Ath~enians; who
desired to deliberate on the affair, and to hear the opi.
nions of their orators. Demosthenes s~poke on this oc-
cation in favour of the Olynthians; and this oration is
commonly intitled his first Olynthian.

He thbere represents Philip, in the first place, as an

ambitious and dangerous prince, a threwd politician, an
indefatigable warrior; and, as a man who, when force
and fIratagem failed, was extremely skilful in accom-
plithing his purposes by a proper application of gold.
In the next place, he deferibe~s him as being imprudent,
rash, de~ceitful, debiauched, and irreligious; and, for
all thes~e reasons, easy to be conquered. Hence he in-
ferred, that the Athenians ought to reform the abofeis
that had crept into the government, to make an end of
private quarrels, and to .combine their united efforts
agairift their common eni-my. Demosthenes enforced
his opinion with fomch firength of argument, and fouch a
power' of eloquence, that he confounded the orators
who fpojke in favour of Philip, and carried his point.
For Philip, already had his creatures in Athens, and,

of the Olynthians increased, and they sent to Athens for

~'Fprevail on the Athenians to persist in afiftming them,

them i~a lively description of the miseries that threatened
thie Olynthian-s, unless they' interpos~ed. in their behalf,'
arid exerted their utmost efforts to fru {Er~ate the attempts
ofPhilip. He hinted, in the mofit artful manner, that·
io~i~tas absolutely neceifary to have re'courfe to the funds
set apa~rt for the expenrce of the public diversions, and to
Applyi part of them to raise troops; This was a point. of
e~idiewxie delicacy; (f~or the people had long ago declared
drde fientiments very explicitly' on that head, by prohi-
biting, under pain of death, any pIerfodn, under whatever
prietene, from proposing to apply to the purpol~es of
wna r any part of th~e thousand talents laid up by Pe-
riclqs as a perpetual fund for de~fi-aying the expence of
th~e pub~lic diverflons, and for furniihing a certain allow-
ancr of money to each of the citizens for assisting at
the public affemblties. Demosthenes, however, difre-
garding this danger, listened only to his zeal fdr the
welfare of the Rtate. He took however the most pru-
dent and artful precuations, both for avoiding the danger,
and ;for succeeding in his design, by re~quiring that com-
millioners thould be named, for examining into ·such
airb~ as th~ould appear repugnant to t~he good of the Rtate.

(tSLa sacred

sacred a light, to be prevailed on, gven by the molk~
powerful eloquence of their grezatorator, to encroach
upon it for the mafit .defu~l of purposes.

In the mean time, a third embassy larrived from the

Olynthians, begging an` additional reinforcemnent, not
of mercenary so~ldiers, but of native Athenians. -Their
r~equest was complied with. But, in spite of this rein-
forcement, Philip, by the treachery of two of the citi.
zens, obtained poffeimon of the town, where he found
great riches. He mad~e one half of the inhabitants pri.
foners, and fold the other. As for ·the traitors who
had betrayed the city to him, he abandoned them to
the insults of the Macedonian soldiers ; telling them fro-
n~ically, that they ought not to regard the exprefirons of
a parcel of unrnannerly fellows, who called every thing
by its pr-oper name.--Philip., highly delighted with ha·-
ving gotten panffelio~n of so important a post, celebrated
his viatory with games and tholws.

The Thebans, exhauffed by their war with the Pho-

ceans, and finding themnfelves utnable tao bring it to

347. an honourable condcution, imaplored the afifitance

of Philip.-N-othing could ·be more imprudent,

than to.call ·that prin~ce~into Gre~ece at this time, when
be desired nothing more ~ardently, than under so ipe-
clous a p~retet as the ~efpoofing of their quarrel, to get
at footing in that country; and - this opport~unity gave
him the greater pleasure, as he wish~ed to pass for a re-
ligiouts prince. But the inveterate htr~ed, entertained
Iby the Th~eb~ass against the Phoceans, mad'e them blind
to every other conside~ratio-n, and induced them to re-
fozrt to t'his dangerous exped~ient, wh-ich eventually oc-
cationed their ruin. `For it. may be truly said, that the
Thebans, by this fiep, f~rramed chains Eo~r Greece.

This f~ucceG, obtained -almost without any expence,
Inade ;Philip sanious through all Greece.

* Phli~p, in th~e mean- time, was deli~berating about ma-,

king the: moRt of his advantage. Havling, for that pur-
pose, corrulpted the ·judges of the council of the Amphici
tyons, he prevailed upon them to assemble, and to pas~s a
dec~ree,· enrjoining hbe- demnolit~ion .of all the cities in the
country of Phocis, and .reducing them to the condition
of timple villages i the inhabitants of which were to pay
an annual tribute. At the fame time, he procured ad-
Inif~on for himself into that celebrated affe'tmbly, with the
privilege of a :double vote, by way of recompentce for
his having vipdicated and enforced the former s~entence
of the Ampph~iiyons, which the Phoceans had treated wnith
such difrefpea. This point was of bigh importance to
Philip,. and cpntributed 'not a little -to- the success of his
subsequent enterprise~s.

·On; receiving intel~ligence of these tranfaftions, the

eyes. of the Athenians were at last opened, and they
were now convinced of their error, i~n not supporting
their allies, as Dlemofthenes had advis~ed, Perceiving
P hiip to be now matter, of the ·pass of T'hermopylae, m
c~onsequence of his conqueRt of the countrly of Phocis,
they, with good reason, grew apprehensive for the fatfe-
ty of their ·own city, and: gave orders to fortify Pirmeus.
But Philip, satisfied with havilng obtained a firm footing
in Greece, put~an end ~to the s~acred ~war, which had now
continued for .the space of ten. years, and acquired, in
the opinion of this Cu~pertitious pe~ople, the' charadler of
a religious prince, alt~hough ambi_'tio.n alone-wa s the real
mnotive of his whole con~du;~b. Not think~ing it advis~e-
abl~e to: push his~advantage any~further for the present,
Philip quietly returned~inzto his :own dominions.

Philip next required the states oaf Gr-eece to confirm

·the f~eatence of the Amrphiftyons, :admitting: him one of

their

their mlimber. IVfany of the' Athenians were, for payinzg
jso regard to thiat sentence.. But Demofthenes,in his
oratio~n for the peace, convinced the~m, thatj their -re'fnida
to c~omply with this request might provoke Pfhilip to de-
part from his engagements; which, ;idi the prefeat coni
jtmaare, was an event by all means to be avoided.
- Philirp, in the mean time, was not idle. He prose-;
ccult~edhins conque~rs on the fide ofhrae bddth
A~thienian colonies in that country, and made him~felfab-
flop~ue matter of Theifaly. Next year he discovered his
intentions of reducing the Cherfonele, a very.rich pe-
roinfulta; which, after .pafi~ng fuccefirvely under -the ·doc
milnion of the A~thenians, the Lacedemnonians, arid t~he
kritgs of Thirace, had lately come into the po~ffeflon of
itsi first masters, all except the city ofCardia, whereof
Obherfobleptus, son of Cotys king of - Thrace, retained
the poffeffion. Phi~lip- having defeated Cherfobleptus,
the; inhabitants of Ca~rdia, appr~ehensive left the Athe*
nians Thohuld reclaim the s~uperiority of their, city, put
flicitafe~lves under the proteation of Philip, who ·engaged
tov44fend them. IDiopithus, governor of the Athenian
c~olony, provoked at this behbaviour of Phili~p, attacked
that prince's territories in Thrace,, and made a great
boo~ty. Philip complained to the Athenians of the iru
ruption of Diopithus. The creatures of Philip fupporti
ed thcsjuffice of this complaint, accused Diopiithus of
mlalverfations in his office, and used all their influence
to· procure his .cyndfemnation. But Demosthenes un-
dertookr the defence of Diopithus, and delivered his ow
ration " On the fubjeat of the Chertonefe." On that
~occaion~, he demonfirated to the Athenians, that the
true design of the aiccufers ofl~iopithus was, to divert
thern from examining too minutely into the co-ndut.a of:
philip; who, with a powerful arriry, ravaged ·the Athe-
nia ·terit~-ories, and aimed at nothing less than the: utter
defiirudion of their republic. At the fame time, he in-
veighed, in the bitterest terms, against those venal de.
cla'ime~rs retain~ed by P'hilip p defecribed them as to many
irdgi~ ettic enemies :as traitors and vipers nourithed by

the repu'tllei in her befor, but who wrould one day iting·
:her : to. death. He showed -in the plainest manner,
that Philip, being affisre~d that his creatures would be al-
srays lea~dy to jufitfy his measures,. would,~ in the fame
snann er, proceed at his leisure to take poffeflon of ail
th~e other provinces of the republic; atnd be concluded,
Iwith exhorting them to put their forces in good order,
and to provide soir the other exigencies of the Rfate*.

B' ut while Den~iothenes was in this manner display.

Ing all the zeal of a worthy citizen, and all the eloquence
of tthe most confumtnrate orator, Phiip, now returned
from his expedition into Illyria, was uniformly intent on
pr;Qfiting by the diffraftions of the Greeks, among ~whom
iilikeord. hadl ag~ain brqken out. The Spartans having,
In a good measure repaired their late losses, began to
diiquiiet· the Arg~ives and Mdeffenians, who comprained
to Philip, and -recive;Gd from lyim a very faviourab~le
hiearing. About the fame time the Thebans, akina-
ted by their· hatred of Sparta, made proposals to him

: .~mining Philip to enter the P~eloponne~se. Imrme-

·diate. yg therefore,: he procured a decree of the Am.
phittjrns, enjoining the Lacedemonians to desist from
·nolefting the Argives and Meffenians, and ·to -permit
them tof rernian in full enjoyment es ,their liberty ; and,
at-the fame time, ~he ordered a body of tr~oops to ad-
vance towardsll ·thre fontiers of Laconia. The Spartans
alarmed at there proceedings, dispatched an embiaff to
Athiens, to endeavour ito prevain on the Athenians to
coisclude with themr an o~ffenfive andc defenairve alliance;
that theyr mig~ht jointly oppose the enterprifSes of Philip,
and prdovide 'for their muntual security.

D:eusefthenes on this occasion gave full vent to his

zeali nd pronounted. ut orattion, wherein he demonfira- ted

.,i`About this time,- viz. ..in the year before Christ 343> a war

d -the jufltice and exrpediency of complying with the; re-
goofit of the Lacedemonians; set Shi a clearer light itill
.the ambitions initentions of Philip, and made at very evl*
Ient that he aimed at nothing less than the total fu~bjee-
tion of Greece: CC Philip (says he), -elcels you assmuch in

adc 8ing as you do him in Epeaking; ·he is ·at this moment
ccadvancing troops ag~ainst the Pelopionnefe. ·Can you

kn~iragine that you athal remain in ·safety, when this

aS prince is in pof~fellon of the whole country- around
ccyou~ ?" In a word, Demnothenes made are of every
argmen to route the Athenians from their lethargy,
a;irid to perfizade them to afifit the Lac~edemonians. The~
·partizans of Philip, on the other hand, repre~feated to
,the Athenians, that as that prince had hitherto commit-
3ed nothing contrary -to the treaties fubi~hing between
him and the republic, it were unjust: in the latter to de-
clare war against hia;· and indeed, in a literal sense this
wRas true. But in the mean time Philip, unwilling to
idraw upon himself the united: force of all. Greece, relin-
qulibed his enterprise againft' the Peloponnese, and
turned his thoughts ·to the conqueRl of Eubces, which
he u oe d to call "L the Aackles of Greece." H aving gpro-
c~ured ·good intelligence within the- illand, he found
mrrea2ns to corrupt the principal ihabitants with ~oniey,
landed a considerable body of troops, took the city of
·Orea, and appointed governors to aB under his autho-
·i~ty. Trlhe Athenians hearing of the danger they ran of; 10.
f~in that island, quickly sent thither some troops unlder
the command of Phocion, an Athenian general, wihole
virtue and singular charader deserve to be particularly
tQaken notice of.

He was a disciple of lIenocrates, and conformed his

life to the most rigid maxims of the philosophy of his
matater, being remarkably serious in his outwvard d~e-
~portment, going always barefoot, and without a cloak,
- never frequenting the public baths, and being a profeffed
enemy of every fort of fltattery. B8ut, notwithstanding
bth istoIical bfehaviour, he Jwas endued in a supreme degree

Aa 4 with21

w~ith th~e power of eloqurence. He did not indeed fludy
the pomnpous and florid -branch of that art; but con.
·foubded his anrnagonift by the firength of his arguments;
came direftly to the point; and. often .with .a single
word confuted the resifoning of ithe; most eloquent -ora.
,t~rcs. On this account Demosthenes ofed to call hinx
S* The prulner of hbis periods."--T his for t of eloquence
.was much relished by the Athenians, who being a people
of a quick, lively apjprehenfion, liked to be infiruated at
-a -word-.--Phocion had already engaged in public affairs,
.and had given proofs of his bravery and other eminent
abilities. After the examnpl of Themiltocles and Arif-
.tid-es, he thought it be(1 to unite military skill with know-
ledge in the art of government.

Phocion, upon his arrival in Eubcea, finding

341. that Plutarch of Erietria, by an initance of the ba-

fest treachery, had changed sides, and taken arms

.against the very troops whol~e afif~tane he had. Solicited,
i~mmediately attacked him, gained a complete vidtory,
expelled. him the country, and had the honour of pre-
serving trhat important island to his coulntrymen.

- Ph~ilip, to counlt-erbE·alance the bad Success of his enter-~

prise aga-int Euboea, resolved to difftre~fs the city of A-
.thens: by famine. VTvith this view he turned his arms
~against Tfhrace, the country whence the Atheni~ans drew
the greatest part of their proviiions, and he laid siege to
Perinthus· a city in the Propontis. But though he in-
vsefied the place with an army-of 30,000 men and innu-
m~erable warlike engines, yet the besieged made fbo -
flinate ·a resistance, that the Byzanntines had time to
-come to their afif~tanc~e. Philip f~ormed the plan of ma-

Philip, eeing -that the Athenians had at last taken the

alarm, endeavoured to quiet them with* fine profeffions.
For thatl purpose he sent them a letter of recrimination,
full of complaints very artfully expressed, whereby he en-
deavoured to thow that. t~he peace had been first infria-
ged on their part. He accused them of flirring up the
Pserfians agai~ni him ,~ and boasted march of his ownm
-£trift: observance of treaties. This letter, written in a
most artful manner, with much dignity and precision,
~and with all the marks ·of candour and truth, made it
evident that Philip ~as -as ikilful a· writer as he was a
brave ·soldier-; qualities in which he greatly res~embled
the all-accomplifhed Julies, the defiroyer of the Roman
liberty. ~Demost~henes exerted every resource of his in-
genuity to efface the firit impreifionrs made by this letter
on the minrds of tfse AtheniaLns.~ He went to the bot-
tom of Philip's allegations, and demonfirated them to be
altogether affecaed and~ groundless. Hfe proved that Phi.
lip himself, and not they, was the first aggressor, by in-
viading ·the Athenian territories; and that his only view
In making the peace, was to disarm them, that so be
might attack theml unprepared. He concluded with
telling them plainly, that, there~ compilaints of Philip's
were equivalent to an open declaration of war; and
that therefore they must no longer be sparing either of
the public funds, or of the wealth of individuals; and
above all, that they ought to employ more able Som-
~mand~ers.

In consequence of these representations, the Athe-

nians order~ed Phocion to march to the relief of Byzcan-
:tiumn with a freth reinforcement. The arrival of that: com-
mander, the fame of whose juff ice .and capacity was umi-
verfally -knwn, disappointed all the schemes of Philip.
Phocion behaved with so much prudence and skill, that
he obliged Philip to raise the siege of Byzantium. He
took several of his thips; recovered Some fortified towns;
and forced him to retire from the Helleipont. The

Byzantines

-ykantines and Perinthians beffowed on Phocin :the
highest mark~s of· gratitude and affei~ion. They ·offered
the freedom of their cities, together; with some extaoar-
dinary p.rivPileg-es, to such: of the·thehnian soldiers as
chOse~ to fettle among them. Theyr passed a s~olemn aft,
wRherein they set forth, that when Philip laid waste their
equntry, and befinged their cities, the Athenians came
to thei~r relief, with a fleet of r so t hips, and saved them
from the extreme miiferies w~herewith they were tchreat-
e ited4; -a~nd lastly, thrgey re~ted fev~eral' statues lir honour

a br art to· amde the Athentians,ofFering propos~als 338*
f pea~ceg and carrying on with them tham negecia-
tionrs, wphich he found means to protraft for the [pace of
twoc years. About that -time he marched against the -Scy-
thians, with an army much less numerous than theirs, and
made a considerable booty. IThe TSriballi, a people of
Madfia, opposed his pass~age back, and obliged him to
come to an engagement. The battle proved obstinate
and ·bloody. Philip was wounded, and on the point of
being ·taken by the enemy, when his son Alexanider,
thbeain the seventeenth year of his· age, hastened to his
afFif~ajrc'e, and had the glory of rescuing him from this
imminent danger. Such were the beginnings of that
valour which was Soon to affonifh the universe.

:IPhilip,defirous of putting a fltop to the continual de~pre.
dat~onsa: committed ;on the maritime parts of his· domi~-
niions by the· incu~lirflons of the Atheniansj, renewed his
nregaciations for peace. 1But Denisofthenes c-oivlinced
the A~thenians- and; Phocion himsel~f, who inclined to
Sliften~to ~Phiip's' proposals, that that- prince intended only
to ·amsufe thern;.and he prevailed with them to continrue
their hoffilities. Philip find2ing the Athenians de~f~ to
alkirer~ms of accommodation, and sensible at the ~a-me
~timne of ·the fiuperiority of the~iir staval 'force :iever `hi~s
eiwln, had recourse to fkratagem, and ferettry engaged
~t~·~']he Thffi~ans and~ Thebans to call him to the~ir al~ift-
airce, that ·so he might enter Greece by the permidios~

of both - For this purpose it ·was: necef fary to produce
_a -rup~ture bietween t holie 'itates and ~Athiens ; and chance
favour~ed -his intentions

~The Ozolae of Locriis being ·cited -before the Am.

phidtysns, on an accuf~ition -of appropriating to their
own use certain grounds belonging ·to the temple of
Delphos, commiironers were appointed- by the judges
to vilit ~the territory in. question, and to inquire whether
the Ozolse were the lawful proprieitors of it or not.
T7he Ozolae, thinking themfelvesdialjuftly diflurbed, i
their poLfffi~ons, treated, the commiio~ners. of the A~m-
phi~tyons as enemies:; .and ·oblige~d them,· by several diif.
charges of darts, to retire. p~recipi~tately.--- This beha.
viour was considered ·as an at of disobedience highly
dese~rving of punithment. And the orators retained in
the pay of Philip represented to the Amphi~yons, that
war ought to be decreed against that sacrilegious people.
But as the Greek Rates seemed backward- to engage in
the enterprise, from. the apprehension, no doubt, of
a s~econd sacred war, the fame orators advi~sed the Am..
phiftyons to employ foreign troops for the execution of
their vengeance, and to choose Philip as their com-
mander,i-n chief. The A~mphi~tyons, niot aware of the
consequences of making such a choice, and well pleased
to save their refpe~ive Rtates the expences of this war,
approved of the propo~sal, and, by a solemn decree, e.
leated Philip commander in chief of the Greeks. Am-
Sbaffa~dors therefore were sent to.beg of him .to come and
vindicate the cause of religion. Philip infkantly affem-
bled an army, entered the country of Phocis, seized on
E~latea the capital city ofrhe country, and -by that means
opened himfelfa pass8age into Attica. The Athenians,
on -receiving intelligence of thes~e proceedings, were
thrown into, great confiernation.

Next day~ an affrembly was holden, where none of the.

oth~er orators attempting to speak, Demosthenes alone
endeavo~ured to -encoulrage the Athenia-ns. As acute a
politician as he was a powerful. orator, he began by ex-
plaining to his countrymen the true nature -of the al.

ni~ded, melans -to terrify into foubj~e~tion such states as

brie inclined to oapp~ofe him. -Hetherefore advised them
·teibarm all their forces; to dispatch ambaffradors to the
o-sther Rates~ to perfoade them to unite in defence of the
comrixon libierty; to give notice to ·the Thebans that
thy? were ready to assist them; arid to endeavour by
ev~ery means to render this -a national war, and to form
ilgeneral confederacy against the common enemy. So
comprehensive and penetrating was "the genius of De-
naidighene~s, that it constantly fuggefied to him the best
refdrces on the anoft prefirng occafions.--Trhe Athe-
- ians ~perceived the full force of his- arguments; ·complied
w~~~~~~'D'D'Difth his advice. in every particular ; and pas~sed a very
solemn decree to that effe(Et, which did great honour to
their good sense and magnanimity.
L·As the negociation whereby they· were to endea-
vourr to persuade the Thebans to accede to the confedel
·racy was of -the utmost importance, because the terr~i.
tory of Ba:0tia was a barrier to that of Attica, Demos-
thene~s was set at the head· of the embassy to Thebes.
Phiilip, at the fame time, sent. thither ambassadors on
his pa-rt s one of whom named Pitbron, celebrated for
his Ilvel~y eloquence, [~poke firit~. He put the TJhe~bans'
ak jimind of the many services rendered them by Philip p:
recapitulated the various inflattn~ces of bad treatmnent r-e-
ceived by them from the Athenians; and ·exhorted
thezn either to ·afift Philip in ~the conquest of Aittica, or

to

by the captious argusracesQ oF Phoni, he that day out-
did tdirett hims~elf. H convinced ·the affemibly, that the
feisuyre 'f- Ela~tea thEfliciently difcove-Sred :the designs of
Philips and that the ruin of ~Atheil~·-na-mai infallibly be
attended with that of: Thebes.- Perceiving, however,
that the Thebans were dis~posed to obs~erve a neutrality,
an~d that· it was a poin~t 'bf the utmioft~ cons~equenc~e to
prevail with them to e~nter into the alliance, his imagi,
naton continued to- wiarm upon him, .and at last threw.
him int~o fuchr a wonderful enthdr~afai- of eloquence,
that he aftonithed the minds of his hearers, and broug~ht
them to· the point he ddfired. He deferibed Philip as
an amblitius, artful, and deceitful prince, .absolut~ely
regardless of good faith ·or treaties, who had formed the
plan of gradually poffdling himself of t~he whole country
of Greece, by subduing its Rtates feiparately, and one
after another; he demonfiraited that his pretended fa-
vours were to many f'nares; and that it was the inte.
reat of both R~ates to unite their w~hole Itrength against
foch a common enemuy.

The Theban~s, conrvinced by the arguments of this

wonderful man, and inflamed with the lo~ve ·of their
country, forgot all former fubjeats of discontent against
their neighbouring Rtate, and entered entirely into the
views of the Athenians.

Demosthenes, ever after, [poke of this negociation

writh the greatet fa8tisfadtion; calling it his masterpiece
in elaquenlCe: and politics ; and telling the Athenians,
shat h~e had diilipatedsthe thunder which growled above
ttheir heads.

Th~fe newPs of this resolution of t~he The'bans difcon-

certed P~hilip's projeats. He therefore betook himself
to. hir old thifts, and .very artfully eqideavoured to dif.
Itade the Athenians from taking arms, offering -them
ad~varitgeou~s ters of =peace. But as he had by this
tim~e loft every degreecaf credit, they were not filly
knough to ~a~:~~trml~'lowth elv to be blinded by his pro-
feilions. .1~or did they pay more reg-ard to the dreadful

responses

',iiling to his pleafore. !On this ~occallon Demnofthenes
hmornoely obfervled, that Pyt~_hia Philipized;
$9both sides therefore prepared -for war. Philr~ipanter-
eg -Beas~tia with an army of So~ooo foot and a oo ohorfe.
His troops were lolt much more natid1ser than t~hose of

command~ed. The bravery of the soldiers was nearly
equyak en both sides; and the athenians wanted nothing

Igge Lyficles, diftinguiihed by his rafhne~s· alone.

:7he - two- armies came to an engagement in the
aeighbourhood of Cheronea, in Boeotia. Philip 33 8*
columanded the right winlg of the Macedonian
army;. and his son Alexander, affill by the most ex-
perienced officers, -t~he left. The battle was foug~ht with
great: obitinacy, and viffory remained long doubtful.
Alexander iihowed hzimfelf worthy the comm~and then
intruffed to him for the first time; and by his valour
an~d prudence ga~ve signs of what he ihould become in
the end. Falling with great impletuofity upon the The-
ha~ns, he broke and put to ~flight their fTamed battalion,
w~hich~ was the flower of their army. Philip, on the o-
thper hand, gained at firik some little advantage over the
Athenians; buzt there quickly repairing the diiforder, in
their t~urn· repidfedi the MJacedonians-. The im~prudence,
how~ever, ors _Lyjicles, occaiion~ed thecir ruin. Think-
ing himeil~f vifterious, after having broken the centre ofr

·Phdirp, transported with joy a~t thi~s iTiatory, ereaed a

trophy, sacrificed to the gods, and gave presents to his
officers~. It is said, that having-n~ext day- give~n a great
entertainmrent, -the -wine raised hlim to such an extrava.
gant pitch of joy, that he ran to the field of battle, in-
fulte~d the d-ead bodies of his ·enemies, an'd fell a dan-
Eing, singin~g at tire fame ti~me :the begi~nning of the de.
cree drawn up by Daemofthenes. It is added, that Die-
mnades;, who wazs ·one- -of the prisoners,; reproached him
with h~is ringenerous behaviour, .b~y telling h'im, that,
being Ag~amemnon, he adted the part of Trherfites;
and that Philip was so far~ from being· offerided at his
boldnefsi, that hze set him at liberty 5 and, as a farther
proof of his generosity,. -sent away all :the other Athe-
nian prisoners withedti~ranforn.· Their countrymen were
so much affe~ted bry P~hilip's obliging conduat on this
o~ccafilon, that they agreed to renew their ancient treaty
of alliance with· him, But that prince could by no means
pardon the Thebans.

The Athenians, after this terrible disas-ter, inficad of

t-eftifyinag .any resentment against Demosthenes, who
had advised thern to undertake the war, still foll-owed
his counsels. In vain did his enemies accuse~ him as the
occasion of th~e misfortune at Cheronea. The people,
convinced of the integrity of his intentions, acquitted
him with honour, pr~eserved- the higheftrefeem for him,
and loaded him with still greater maris of their favour
and confidence. Guards were potted, and fortifications
tepaired byT his 'advice. - ~He was ·pitched upon to pro-~
nounce the funeral~ortion of the brave men who had
fallen- at Cheronea; and thbe Athenians inclosed their
bones in a magtificent~ sho~nument with an inferipDtion,

igportingi that, they had fallen in the cause of their
yo~untry.

It may be ihere~ remarked in pafiingi that there fune-

ral orations, and the other public marks of diftinaiott
b~effowed on thiofe who ,had died in battle, were admi.
rably calculated ·to inspire the Athenian youth with art
ardent desire of military glory. The sons of thnofe who
were slain in fight, were produc~ed at the first feast celei
brated after -such fight, clothed in co~mplete armours
and attended by a herald, who made a· public procla-
mation' in the following terms : '* These~ young orphansi
C· ~;·Whom a premature death in thie s~ervice of thle (tate
* 'has deprived of th~eir fathers, have found in the peoi
c ~ple a common father, who charge themselves with
ac the care of them till they shall arrive at the arge of
'' manhood; and they are refpe~lively invite'd to aspire
** at the foremost employments in the commonwealth.'"

The people further committed to Demo'fthettes the
charge of procuring provisions for the city ; and decreed~
him a crown"of gold, for having furnished a fulm of
money to repair the walls. The sentence of Otefiphong
decreeing this crown to Demof~theness having been are~
raigned by Effchines, the c=ause was tried with uncome
mon solemnity, and a vast concourse of' people affremi
blled from all quarters to hear this important dispute bes
tween two so celebrated orators. Diemofthenes ih~ond
particularly in his answer to the inveaives of Ef~chiess
on the f~ubjea of the defeat at Cheronea. Hre tol'd the
audienIce, that he was by no means answerable for that
event, which, like every other, was in the power of
the gods alone, who disposed of viatory at their pleafareg
Then he addressed himself to the Athenians in a style of .
rhetoric the most figurative and bold that is any where:
to be met with. ** No, Athenians, I [weart to you byi
" the manes of thos~e bravre ci~tizens, who facrifiedd their
"( lives for the. liberty of their country, on land at Mia-
"' rathon and Pilatea, on sea at Sjala~mis and A2rteimifiantsi
' and by the multitude of others, who, though~ unfixc-
'C c~efsful~in the fame glorious cause, have been honour-

Bb ed

"C ed by the republic with the solemn rites of burial, no4t
CC by thofre alone who were fortunate and viatorious,
"' that you aated as you· ought;"

Though the Macedonian fa~tion was now become very

powerful at Athens, Efchines nevertheles~s failed, was
even punished with banishment, and ojbliged to take re.
fuge at Rhodes. ' On this occallon D~emosthenes beha-
vgtd to his rival with great generofxty ; and as he was
departing, forced him to accept of a considerable fum of
money. Efchines was to struck with his behaviour,
that he burit~ out into this exclamation: "L How much,";
said he, " must I regret the loss of a country, where I
CC leave Such an enemy, that I despair of finding any
CC where else to generous a friend ?' On arriving at
Rhodes, he opened a school for eloquence, and began
with reciting- his oration against Demosthenes, which
wras very highly commended by his audience. But ha-
ving proceeded"to recite that made in answer to it by
D~emosthenes, nothing was heard but a general thout
of applause; insomuch that Efchines could not refrain
from crying out, CC Ah ! what thould you have thought
'C of it, had you heard him deliver it himself ?" A4 fay
ing that did as much honour to dlie candour of the one
as to the eloiquence of the other. Ef~chines was very
much efteremed as an orator by the Athenians, who
called those three discourses of his that yet remain by
the names of lT~he th~ee G~races.
,The misfortune at Cheronea was charged against the
generals Chares and Lyficles; and Lycurgus the orator
became the publ'ic accuser of the latter. This Lycurgus
being a man of great integrity, but of a rigid severe
charadter, inveighed against Lyficles in the bitterefti
terms. C' You commanded,"l Said he, "C and a thou-
C ·sand citizecns were killed; you commanded, and all
CC Greece was enflaved."1 He so exasperated the peo-
ple, that Lyficles was put to death. Chares, though
equally culp~able with his colleague, was, by some means
or other, acquitted. LyfCldes was a man poffeffed of no

other

.ather~..rerit than extraordinary bodily firength, and the
impudence and presumption of a bully.

TChe decline of Grecian liberty may be dated from the

.battle of Cheronea. That vicaory, by spreading the
terror of Philip's a~rms through Greece, paved his way
to a more complete conquest~. TIlhe Lacedemonian
Ppower, which lately had made both Gfreece and Asia to
tremble, was now so much decayerd, that we find them
hardly named among the fltates by whom the enterprises
of Philip were opposed.

That prince found he had at length attained the point

at which he had so long aimed ; and penceived, that at
preset it would be no diffcult matter for him to reduce
the Greeks entirely under his power. He therefore re-
solved to undertake an expedition he had long enedita-
ted inainft the Persians; and to prevail with thle Greeks
to join him in it, he procured himnfel~f to be chosen their
commander in chief by an affemnbly composed of mem'-
bers from all the (tates. He foion after wards dispatched
part of his army into Asia IVl'inor, under the command
of Attalus and Parmenio. It is certain, however, that
1Philip neglefted to profit as he might by his late vilkt-~
r~ ;whether he thought it still dangerous _to push the
G eeks to the last extremity; or, whether he was fatis-
fied with having humbled their pride, and with having
o~btained himself to be eledked their generalidfimo.
WIIhatever mayr have been the cause, he resolved, before
proceeding on his Persian expedition, to put his private
family aff~airs in order.

·The.joy which Philip derived fr~om the success of his

militairy operations, was diflurbed by the diviflons that
prevailed in his family. His first wife, Olympias, a
woman of a revengeful, jealous dilpolition, had so pro-
voke~d him by her ill temper, that he had divorced her,
and taken to wife Cleopatra, the niece of -Attalus, one
of his principal officers. This new marriage was folem-
nized with much pomp and solemnity; h ut was in the
endi troubled. by a quarrel· between Attalus and Alex-
ander. The former, when heated writh~ wine, having

·Bbs PaiO,

said very xmprudently, that the Macedonians ou be to
phray to the gods to beffow on them a lawful fu ceffoo
by their new queen p Alexander started up in a pairin
and thro~wing his cup at the head of Attalus, cr pd ont,
" How ' wretch, dost thou take me for a baftarod"
Phihip, in a rage, flew at his son with his fwrord in his
hand; but bemng lame Rtumbled, to that the reft of the
company had time to interpole, and to prevrent his do,
ing any mikchief. Alexander, unable to digest the as-
front, had the boldnes~s to rally his father· on his fall
telling hr m, that it was ridiculous for him to think of
an expeditio~n into Asia, who could not safely walk from
one table to another. Alexander soon after left the
cou~rt, and retired with his mother into Epire. This
wNas the prelude to a bloody tragedy.

Phihip, by the intercefioin of- Demaratus, recalled his

son to court. As he had his Persian expedition much
at heart, he resolved to consult the gods about the event
of it, ·and gave a favourable interpretation to a very
ambiguous response of the Delphic priestess. After this
having promis~ed his daughter Cleopatra in marriage to
Alexander king of: Epire, the brother of Olympias, he
resolved to celebrate the marriage with great magnifi-
cence, and invited the principal men in Greece to be
pief~eat at the ceremony. Most of the cities, on that
occalion, lavished on Philip the highest elogiums; and
some of them- sent him crowns of gold. Athens parti-
cularly, the nurse of' orators and poets, was among the
firRt to pay her homage. A tragedy was at this time
performed, wherein Philip was represented under a
feigned name, as conlqueror of D~ariu~s and master of
Asia. Next day games and shows were celebrated.

After the marriage a sumptuous ~feast was given,

which was dillinguifhed by a grand procession from the
palace to the theatre. In this proceiion were carried
twelve statues of exquisite workmanship; of which one
that represented Philip, under the figure of a god,
greatly surpassed the reft. The king himself, dressed in
w~hite, appeared as the principal personage in this pro-

cession,

ce~dion, marching between two files of his guards, who
were ranged at some difiance., But in the instant that
Philip, amidit the joyful thouts and acclamations ,of his
fiibje~ts, was tasting the highest pleasure of which the
vanity of man is susceptible, a young Macedonian called
Paus~anias, breaks through the crowd, and plunging a
dagger into the bosom of Philip, firikres him
dead on the spot. The affa~irn fled; but was 336.
pursued, taken, and in the firit transports of rage
excited by his bloody deed, cut in pieces. This Pan-
f~anieis, on being difhnonoured in the moit infamous man-
ner by Attalus, Philip's uncle, had applied for fatisfac-
t-ion to Philip, who, averse to punish Attalus, amdfed
Panfanias with vain promises. The young man takin~g
thos~e delays for an absolute refusal of juffice, was exaf-
perated to the highest degree, and resolved in revenge
to affafirnate Philip; which accordingly he accomplished
in the manner just: mentioned.

Olympias, however, was accus~ed, and with a good

deal of probability, of having had a hand in the murder
of her hudband. For, ins tead of showing any concern
for fouch an imputation being laid to her charge, the
cad~ed the body of the affaffin to be taken down from
the cross and to be buried, and afterwards vented her
-rage on Cleopatra, by murdering her son in her arms.

Thie w ews of Philip's death was received with the

greatest aoy through all Greece; but particularly at A-
thens, where the people crowned themselves· with gar-
lands, and behaved with the most indecent marks of
pleasure and rejoicing. Even Demosthenes himlelf ap-
peared in t~he public assembly with a garland of flowers
in his hand, and exhorted the Ahthenians to thank~ the
gods for this event.

Thus perished, at the age of forty-fevenl years, and in

the twenty-fourth year of his reign, Philip king of Mace-
don,- a prince of a most ambitious and enterprising cha-
acteir. By his own account,· the happiness of nations,
.the reparation of injuries, and the deftraft~ion of ty.
ranny, were the sole motives of his. co-nduft. But not..

BbS wit hp

withft~airding those profeiiions, he was continually aim-
in g, by imperceptible means, at some private design;
and' be prosecuted all his Schemes with undeviatingf per-
severance. He was imlpenetrable as to his views and in-
tentions, and never made arse of confidents. Fruitful
in r efources, he seldom had recourse to force till ad~
dres`s failed him. But when once en.gaged in war, he
naetd with the utmost diligence, vigour, and intrepedi.
t~y, and was inferior to no commande~r of his time either
for bravery or conduat. He rendered his soldiers the
best in Greece i was particularly ilkilful in con~ciliating
their affeation by a familiar and complaisant behaviour,
tmd in mnaintaining at the fame time his arithority over
them in full force. Besides the accomnplifhments already
mentioned, Philip had acquired a Rtock of the most va-
Juable and finest parts of learning, and wrote and ipoke
with equal dignity and ease. He was a consummate po-
litician, always fiz~iing the moit favouirable moment for
attacking his enemies, availing himfelfof their weakness3
and domeltic troubles, and by a liberal difkribution of -
gold bringing over to his intereifs fame of the leading
mnen in every slate. H~e readilfy granted his assistance to
those who de~sired it, and laboured to weaken the

1But the defeas in this prince's chara~ter did more

perhaps than counterbalaqce: his great parts. For, tho'
a most artful pIolitician, the mleans he· employed were al-
'ixoft always contrary to jufitce and good faith. H-e ne-
ver hesitated to deceive those with whom hee treated;
and he was little ferupulous about -praEtifing fraud,
perfidy, or any other crime, provided it. might contri-
bute to the advancement of ·his po we r. He appears,
too, to have been entirely devoid of religion. H-e used!
to fay, that children were to be amused with toys, and
men with oaths.-W hat an abomninable charaa'er !
.Such, however, is the pidure of this prince oftered us by
biftory; not the less detestable, surely, for being that of
a prince. But though truly of no religion, he .chos~e,
kopeyer, to aiffine the appearance of it, and affeaed

to keep a public officer to remind him every morning of
his being mortaL. The Greeks were the dupes of his
hypocrisy; which, together' with every other artifice,
he employe-d to foment among them dissention and
jaroury. Ife (tudied particularly to keep up and to en-
c ease the animosity that fubflted between the 'Thebans
and Athenians *rand most of the citizens of both repub.
lics fell into the [Cnare.

-He was, however, a itrift, and, for the most part,
an impartial julticiary. Of this hiffory records f'everal
inatances. One day, as he was returnmng from a long
debauch, a woman having beg~ged of him to- decide'
her cad~e, he had it pled on the spot, and gave sentence
againfkher. "6 I appeal from the judgment,"ce
the wromnan. c H~owr ! fro m your king ?"anfrwered
Philip, "' and to whom do you appeal?" ZC To ·Philip
Lwhen falling," replied the woman. Philip, ftrucle
with the words of the woman, reviewed the cadre, and
altered his former judgment. With refpea to his mo-
·rals,he was a profeffed debauchee ; his most intimate
friends were persons of the fame charafter ; and his
court was filled with drunkards anld buffoons.l

T~jhofe of the learned who have fludied with most ac-

curacy the merits of the father and of the son, are of
opinion, that the extent of Alexander's conquests does
not equal the difficulty of those of Philip; and· that it
was more caly for the formaer -to subdue Asia with the
aflitance of the Greeks, than for the lar ter to destroy
the power of the Greeks with Macedonian firength a-
lone. "C It must: be allowed," says M. 'Tourrell, "C that
"' at first fight we are inclined to ·give the prefe-rence to
"r Alexander, the splendor of whofie conquests outfhines
"' that of Philip's; but on a more narrow infpertion,
"' and on balancing the obltacles that lay in the way of
Ccthe one against the circumstances that for warded the
fC uccefs of the other, we shall be of opinion, with Ci-
'C cero, that the son was a great conqueror, but that
' t~he father was a great man."

Pfairs of the Greeks, Macedon~ians, and Per/ians, from

' the deatht of Phili~p tell the death of Dariucs Codomanusz

kaing of Perjiz.
JSLW b1 ~ ave already observed, that Alexander

$54. was born in the year. before Christ

356. From his infancy, he, on several occa-

fions, gave proofs of an extraordinary loftiness of fienti-
inent. Being one day asked by his friends, whether he
would not shoofe to contend in the foot races.at the
Olympic games (for he was extremely twvift of foot), he
answered, that he would, if kings *zoere t~o be h5is com7peti-
tors. On receivmng the news iof a city being· taken or?
a battle won by his father, so far frown discovering any
fignss of joy, he ofed to appear melancholy and difcon-
solate. 's My friends (would he fay), my father will ac.
'C compli-th every thing, and will leave nothing at all for
'r Ime to do.''

In every branch of learning that it was thought ne-

ceffary to _teach him, he m~ade affonifhing progress. W~e
have told already, that~d~ilip gave him for preceptor
the famous Aristotle, Alexander conceived as high
an eff eem for that. illuff rious philosopher as Philip en-
tertained for himI~. He went farther, and even honoured
him as a father, saying, that his natural father had given
him existence, but that this second father had taught
him to make the proper use of his exiffence. U~nder
such a master, the happy genius of Alexander made the
most rapid progress ; and he Toon imbibed the principles
of the whole circle of philosophy. Aristotle chiefly flu-
died to enable his pupil, by a proper cultivation of his
judgment, to distinguish between just reasoning and fol
philtry, and to maake him minutely acquainted with eve-
Iry brana~ch of morals, which he rega-rded as the only
Soundation of prudence and wisdom. In teaching hire

rhgev

kjhetoric, he took pains to show what species of eloquence
is· molt becoming of a sovereign prince; and he made?
,him flenfible that it ought to a~bound less with figures than
with'fenfe; that it ought to be firong and nervous,·ra-
thber than florid ; and to reft more on fasts than on
words.

Alexrander was particularly fond of Homer, whose
wKorks he regarded as the noblest produdions of human·
genius. In them he was delighted to discover captiva-
inag exhibitions of that valour and magnanimity with
wh~ichi he himself was animated. It is well known,
that after the: battle of -Arbela, he ordered a most:
iraluable golden box that had belonged to Darius.
go be set apart for holding the books of Homer.

lutarch tells us, -that he loved to re~ad and to .con-
h8erf~ie with men of learning ; two admirable sources
of infiru~tion to a prince, On the ~fine arts, fouch as
snuific, painting, and sculpture, he ·beffowed but a cur-
fCery attention, f~ufficient to give him an idea of their
value and of~e; which in fouch matters is all that a prince
:eught to know. He was of an a~ive impetuous difpo-
-fition, and very tenacious of his opinion. He very
early became the soft expert borfemnan in his father's
·court; and was the only per~son who dared to back the
-famous Bucephalus, a very fine horse, sent as a present
to Philip, but so fiery and high-mettled, that they de-
Spai~red to be able to break hini. It was on this occa-
sion that Philip, feeing Alexan~der returning from finish.
ing. the course in which he had backed this ungovern-
able horse, cried out to him in a rapture, CC Seek, my

fr on, another kingdom, Macedonia is not worthy
Lto contain ~ou.P" It is s~aid,~ that this horse would
afterwards f~uffer no person but Alexander to mount
him; that he leaned down on his knees to receive him
~on his back; that after being mortally wounded in the
battle against Sorus, he f3v~ed the life of Alexander, by
carrying him through the crowd of enemlies that ~fur-
Vounded him, and then expired ; that Alexander thed
spyts for his death 3 and, in memory of him, -built on

the

the banks of the Hydafp~is a city, which he called after
him Bucephalia.

Alexander mounted the throne of M~acedomla at the

age of twenty years ; and in the fame year that Darius
Codomannus mounted that ofPerfia. After performing
the ceremonies of his father's funeral, Alexander ap-
plied his attention to secure the conquests of Philip over
the neighbouring nations, which at prelent were far
from being in a f~et~tled condition. In Greece, parti-
cularly, though Philip had awed the Rtates into filbmif~-
iion by the terror of his arms, yet their ·minds were far
from being reconciled to his authority. The conjunc-
ture was delicate. The question was, whether he thould
endeavour to preserve those conquests by moderation
and intrigue, or by the force of arms~ ?Alexander
quickly formed his resolution, hearkening alone to the
diatates of his courage.

To quell the commotions that bad already broken out

among fame of the barbarous nations who had taken
arms, he hastily led his army towards the Danube,
pas~sed that river in the night, and defeated the Triballi
in a great battle. About the f~ame· time the slates of
G~reece formed a confederacy against .him; and a ru.
mour having arisen that he was killed, the Thebans
made an inf~urreftion, and cut in pieces the Macedonian
garrison that held their city in fabjeftion. At Athens,
too, Demosthenes put all in motion, calling Alexander
(of whose real charadter he was yet ignorant) a giddy
young man ; and he wrote letters to Attalus, one of
Philip's generals in Asia Minor, advising him to revolt.
A2lexrander, already suspicious of the fidelity of Attalus,
thought it necessary to have him taken off, although he
had transm-itted to him thfe treaforrable letters of De-
mofthen es.

After making the Barbarians sensible of his merit, he

resolved to proceed to Greece. CL It .is proper," said
he, CC to show Demnofhenes at the gates of Athens, that
cC I am every way a man."· He advanced, therefore,
towards the pass of Thermopylae ; plaf ed it without re-

f if tahce;

ifiatnce; entered Boeotia ; required of the Th-eibans to
deliver up to him Phaenix and Prothentes, the authors
of their infurredhion; and, on their refusal to comply
with bhis demand, immediately attacked them. The
Thebans fought with great bravery and obstinacy; but
being much inferior to the Macedonians in point of
numbers, they were at last broken, and almnoft all cut of&~
IVdore than 600o men were killed on the spot. Thebes
wlas taken, and treated with the utmost rigour of war.
4 4estand~er, personally incensed against the Thebans for
the extravagant joy they had test~ified at ·the news of his
dieath, resolved to satisfy his vengeance, by the utter
deftruttion of their unhappy city. He fold more than
So~ooo of the inhabitants for slaves; and permitted none
to enjoy their liberty except the priests, and the de.
fcende-nts of the celebrated poet Pinda-r.

The total ruin of Thebes, and the severity of Ales-

~tader- to its miserable inha~bitants, threw the other Rtates
into: the greatest consternation. Every thing gave way
to him; and even the Athenians, with Demnofthenes
h'imfelf, implored the mercy of the conqueror by a so-
lemn deputation. Alexander, however, dispatched mef-
feragers to the Ath~enians, insisting on their delivering'
up to him ten of the orators, who had beenp chiefly in--
firemental in forming the late confederac igazint him.
The orator Dlemtades, a particular favourite of Alexander,
undertook+ to soften him. The Macedonian having al-
ready sa8tisfied his refeatmnent by the ruin of the Th~e.
bans, and being unwvilling to be detained from the exe-
cution' of the great design he was meditating, gave a fa-
venrabl~e hearing to Demades, insisted on the b~aniifh.
ment of Charidemus alone, frankly forgave the Athe-
nians,· and exhorted them to, watch over the affairs of
Greece during his absence. Then he assembled all the
Rtates at Corinth, and procured himself to be fo'lemnly
'elefted commander in chief of the Greeks against
P"So grand an underrtaking, calculated to dethrone the
bfevreign of the east, and to produce the greatest revo.

-·· lution,

Intion, fTo fdr as we know, that ever happened on our
earth, required a conduator of the most extensive ge.
asius, intrepid, ·enterprising, incapable of being Rtopped
by any obstacle, and endued with the greatest abilites of
every kind.--Such a man was Alexander.-I-t is, at the
fame time, true, that he found the Greekrs Rtill adluated by
their. inveterate hatred of the Persians, whom to subdue
was the most ardent desire of their fouls. It is likewise
true, that, however otherwise corrupted, they Htill main,
tained their superiority in arms over the Persians. The.
famous retreat of the Io,ooo Greeks was yet fresh in
every body's remembrance; ·as were the exploits of
Agefilaus, who with a handful of men had made the
gr~eat king to tremble on his throne. The bravery of
the Macedonian troops was univerfalliy known.

It was at the time of this solemn affernbly of the Rtates

of Greece at Corinth, that Alexander, fizrprifed at not
being vilited by the famous Diogenes, as he had
.been by all the other eminent' philosophers, resolved
to pay that Cynic a visit. Finding Dioigenes basking
In the fun, and in a situation that indicated extreme
poverty, 'Alexander asked him, whether he wanted any
thing. ** Yes," anfawered Diogenes, ** I want you to
**e -remove from between me and the fun-beams."--
This answer raif'ed the indignation of the courtirers,
but attra £ed the admiration of Alexander; who de-
clared, that if he were not Alexrander he would choos~e
to be Diogenes.

Alexander, before setting off for Ahfia,went to Delphos,

to consult the prieffers of ~Apollo. But the prieflefs having
refused to go to the temple, because the day happened to
be one of thos~e called inauspicious, on which the was
prohibited from consulting the god, Alexander is said to
have laid hold of her by the arm, to force her to go
thither. The priestess having thereupon cried out,
** O, my son, it is impossible to resist you," Alexander
took there words for the response ; and, without re-
quiring any other, returned to Macedonia; where, after
maiking the necessary preparations for. his departure, offiering

offering a folernn sacrifice, and celebrating public games,
he ~gave a grand: entertainment: to all the princes of the
b~ood, and general officers, at which there were no
fewer than zoo tables.

Alexander having appointed Antipater governor of

blacedonia during his ablence, .diffribeuted in prefiants
and· largeiffs among his friends almost all the domains
helonging to the crown, beffowing a portion of land
ori-Pne, a town on another, royal privileges and exemp-
tions' on a third.

Alexander set out for Asia in the beginning
oflfpring, at the head of an army of So,oooi foot 3 34*
sad" Sooo horse. Most of his officers were men,
-who,· having grown old in the f~ervie of Philip, were
thoroughly experienced in the art of war; and his fol.
diers were= all veterans, and perfe~tl-y· acquainted with
dilcipline. Parmenio commanded the foot, as did his
sori Philotas a part of the horse. Alexander marched
diref~tly to the Helles~pont, which he passed with I~o
galleys and several smaller ves~sels ; condufting, with his
own hand the galley wherein he failed himself.

HNis treasury was very inadequate to so great an un-

dertaking. But both Alexander and his officers were
fir~mly persuaded that they were mnarching rather to cer-
tain conquest, than to attemnpt a doubtful expedition.
Al;exander was the firlt of his army that jumped on A-
flatic ground. Arriving at Ilium, he resolved. to cele-
brate public games to the memory of Achilles; which
he caused to be performed around that hero's tomb.
On that occasion, he expreffJed his envy of the good
fortune of Achilles, in having fobund a faithful friend
while he lived, and after his death a Homer to immor-
talize his exploits.

WiJhen he arrived at the banks of the Granicus, Par-

menio advis~ed to halt a little, that the troops might have
fame time to repose themselves. But Alexander's ea-
gernefs to proceed, prevented his complying with this
advice. He s~aid, it was proper to take advantage of the
terror which the news of his arrival had created among;

the

the P~erfans. His courage was rather animated than
depressed at the view of the vast army which waited for
him on the opposite fide of the river ; and which a-
mounted to upwards of a oo,ooo foot and I0,000
hors~e, under the. command of Mlemnon the Rhodian, a
very lkilful general.

Alexrander placing himself at the head of the right

wing of his army, plunged into the river, and was fol-
lowed by all his troops. The Persians, feeing the IVla.
cedonians advancing, assailed them with a thiower of.
darts. Both armies come at last: to the charge. The
Macedonians, fighting under the double disadvantage of
inferiority in point of numbers, and the worit ground,.
give way a little at first. Alexander encourages them
by hs pretence, deals death with every firoke, and
bears down all before him. He charges the Pedian ca·-
valry, which make a brave refifte-nce. .He engages Spi-
throbates, the fon-in-law of Darius, and transfixes hun
with a lance. Here Clitus, whRto fought by Alexander's
fide, saved his life, by intercepting the firoke of a
battle-ax that was aimed at him. The ~Macedomians,
feeing the danger that threatened their king, redoubled
their efforts, and at last put the Persian cavalry to flight.
Then Ailexander charges the enemy's infantry with tHs
~Macedonian phalanx, which had by this time pass~ed the
river. The Persians, confounded at the boldness of the
Mh(acedonians,. made but a feeble resistance, and were
quickly routed. No part of the Persian army now kept
its ground, except a body of Grecian, infantry engaged
in the service of Darius. There finding themsel~ves de-
fCerted by the Persians, and their retreat cut off by the
IVacedonians, began a most obstinate engagement; and
being all brave w'ell-dif~ciplined veterans, they fought
with the moss d8esperate obstinacy, and were all krilled
on the spot except 2000, who were made prisoners.
The Persians, in this battle, loft sozooo foot and 2500
hor~e." The loss of Alexander was only about 200 men,
among whom were twenty-five horsemen of the royal
guard, to wnhofe memory Alexander ordered itatues

hei· ere~-ed. He showed the utmost attention to the
wrounde~d, going himself to fee them dreiffed. He or-
dered all the Greek prisoners to be conveyed to ~Mace-
donia, and sent to the Athenians Soo Persian bucklers
as a token of his via~ory.

This viaor~y was a- happy prelude to those that were

to follow, and served to propagate the terror of the Ma-
cedonian arms. Sardis, the key of Upper Ahiia, open-
ed its gates to the co'nqueror. Ephesus followed the exr-
ample; and AClexander there offe~red sacrifices to Diana.
Trallis and M~agnesia, in likre manner, sent him their
keys. Miletus alone, where the brave Memnon had
taken refuge, refolved' to stand i filege, and made a long
rrfiftance. But upon the M~acedonians attempting an
afaul~t, after having made several breaches in the walls,
the garriflon thought proper to capitulate.
" Alexander, to deprive his troops of all hopes of re-
.turn, unless viatorious, ordered his fleet to be destroyed y
reserving only a few thips for transporting such engines
as might be necess~ary in the course of the expedition.
He next marched towards Halicarnassus, to which he
la~id siege. The inhabitants, commaanded by Memnon,
made so very long and vigorous a resistance, that a man of
less obitinacy and resolution than Alexander would have.
been wearied out, and would have abandoned the en-
terprife. But he persisted, and at last prevailed. Mem-
·non, however, made his escape by sea, with the greater
part of the inhabitants, and the riches of the' town.

Upon this, several princes of ACia M/Sinor submitted to

Alexander, and acknowledged him for their f~uprior
and sovereign; and, among the reft, M~ithridates king
`of Pontus, who, resolving to follow the fortunes of A-
lexander, accompanied him in all his future expeditions.
ALlexpanderfpent the winter in the province of Mithridates;

tion between Syria and Pamphylia. This defile hap-

3 Aler*

Alexander's soldiers were obliged to march a whole day
In the water.

lIt was about this that hie discovered a confp)Aracy

against his life. Alenander, ·the son of Eropus, gene-
ral of his cavalry, was the principal author of this cora
fp·iracy, which he was induced to undertake by a pro-
anise of t ooo talents of gold by Darius. The traitor
was immediately put to death. Alexander arriving in
P'hrygia, took Celene' after· s~ome resistance. From
thence he proceeded to Gordion·, where he desired to
fee the chariot to which was tied the famous Gordion
ktnot, ; fme oracle having declared, that he who loos~ed
it <fhould arrive at the empire of Asia. Alexander,
after trying in vainl to untie it, cut it m ~pieces with his
fwsord, fabying, That the manner of loosing it was of no
importance, provided the thing were accomplithed.

In the mean timne, Mj~emnon the Rhodian, the best

general that Da~rius had, advised that king to carry the
war into Macedonia, by which mneans he could makse
such a diverfxron as would lay Aklexander under the ne-
cefirty of returning to Europe, to defend his own domi-
nions. D~arius approved of the' advice, and gave Mem-·
non the command of a fleet for putting it in execu-
tion. Wemnron. thereupon reduced Chies and Lesbos,
Buit died as he was belieging Mytilene. Darius was
extremely sorry for the lofstof that general ( and having
now no, other commander capable of supplying his place,
he was obliged to take the command of his armies him·
self.

Alexander thus freed of MVemnon, whole abilities

might have thrown great obitacles in the way- of his
proje~ts, subdued Cappadocia, advanced towards the
Higher Asia, and arrived at the pass of Cilicia, by
which alone he could penetrate into the country of
T'arfus. On this occasion, he was highly favoured by
his good fortune. For though his army might have
been long stopped, and iperhaps defeated at this pass,
which' was very narrow,--yet he found it quite un-
guarded, passed it without opp~osition, and arrived at

'rarfus time enough to prevent that very rxch townr
rank~ol being burnt by the Persians.

It was now aboilt the end of fnummer, and the

wNeather was violently hot. Alexander, firuckr g g g
with the clearners of the: waters of the river Cyd-
asus, which waihes that city, . resolved to bathe in it.
But be had hardly entered the water, wyhen he was
fEeized with an exceflivee chilnefs. Thafb that w~ere widx

insensibility. The news of this accidenit filled the camp

The Greek comamanaders, in the s~ervice of Darius, ad.
uifed that monarch to wait for the enemy in the plains
o3f Assyria, vjhere he might avail h~limelf of all his
firength, This prudent advice was accounted traiterous
by the courtiers, who, therefore, were of opinion,
that thiofe Greeks, together with their men, oright to
be immediately cut in pieces. But Dairius reje~ted this
proposal wvith horror ; and after thanking the Greeks
for their ,advice, s~et forward to meet his enemy. -Da-
rius- direated his march towardas Ciilcia, entering into
that country~ by the pass of Ammanicus, which lies above
that of Syria 5 and then advanced towards IIffu, with.

hand, Darius could not make d~e of the twentietth part
( his. He felt, however, orml' anxiety at being on
@ie eve of coming to so important an adtibm; but his
natural intrepidity quickly got the bett~er of all h~is ap-
prehentions. After causing his troops to refresh them-
selves, and offering up a folemnn sacrifice to the gods, he
gave orders at midnight for marching, and brought his
army iby day-break to the flation he inten~ded to occupy.
H-;earing that Darius was within a league and a half of
idim, he immediately ranged his troops in battle order.
The [pot wih-er~eocn they were drawn up was a fine
Pla:in In the neighbourhood of the river Jilbs, con-
fined by mountains on one fide, and by the sea on the
.other. H~e disposed his cavalry on the wings~; and-
formed th e p halanx into ·fix ·divitions.----Craeero s
commanded the infantriy on the extremnity ~of the left
wing; Parmienio the reft of that wing; and Alexander
h~imelf the right wing.--His cavalry were covered by his
ight~ armed troops, and his infantry by a body of archers
under Antiochus.

D:.arius ·placed in the centre of his first: line 30,000

Greekrs who were in his f~ervie, and being aUl comnplete-
ly7 armed and disciplined after the GCrec·ian m~anner,
foimed the main fitrenogth of his army. T~he reft of his
iifantry were drawn up behind the firlt line, exept
so~ooo who were posted oni the mountain on the right
of thte;Macedonians. H-is cavalry was ordered to cross
the river Pinarus which ran through the middle of the
plain; an~d then a large detachmnent of them pushed on
towards Parmenio. Alexander oblerving this motion of
the Persian Icavaltry, altered his formler difpolition ai
little, commanded the Theffalian cavalry to occupy the
poftr at which the Persian cavalry seemed to aim, anid
itationed his light armed troops- in front of his infin~try.

Tl;he main bodies of both: armies, coming at last in
view of each other, Alexrander r~ode through his ranks
an~d exhorted' his soldiers to do their duty, reminding
the Macedonians of their repeated vi~tories in Europe,
and~ of their recent and mloft glorious success at the Gfra4

Oby~ nicus,

nertls, and assuring them, that a single vidtory would
render them matters of the empire of Persia ; exhorting
the Greeks to recall to t~heir remembrance the heroic
behavioulr- of their anceffors at Ml~arathon, Thiermopylmj
and Salamis, and the mniferies brought upon their coua-
try by the Persians ; and animating the Illyrians and
`Th~racians with the hopes of the immens~e plunder the
Persian army, if beaten, thould afford them. The whole
army called aloud to be led on to the ·engagem~ent.

The right wing of the M/acedonians, to avoid as much

as pofirble the iholyers of darts poured upon them by
the Persians,· plunged immediately into the river, and
advcanced to the charge. The thock was extremely
violent, and they fought man to man. Alexander was
very desirous of having the honour to engage Darius
hand to hand ; and the fight of that monarch, confpi-
cuoufly mounted on his superb chariot, redoubled this
desire in the Macedonian hero, who idltantly pushed ~for-
wkard, and ·exerted his utmost efforts to reach Darius.
The battle round the king became very desperate, and
a great number of Persian noblemen were killed fighting
bravely. The horses of Darius being wounded, rear
and break loos~e from the yoke. Darius jumps from
that chariot, mounts another, flies, and is followed by
the whole right waing of his army. On the other hand,
the reft of the Macedonian army being attacked in flank
by the G3reek troops, as warlike and well dilciplined as
themselves, had occasion for all their bravery to support
the charge. The battle between, them was very bloody
and doubtful. But the Macedonian right wing, now
vigtorious, flies to the af~iftance of their left, attacks the
Greeks in flank, and obliges them to give way. At
the fame time the Persian had charged the Theffa~lian
cavalry, and had at first broken through s~everal f~qua~-
drons.--Th'e Theifalians affefting to take flight, as if
flruck with a janic, the Persians pursue them in disorder;
but the Th~elfaiians rallying unexpettedly, renew the
engagement. Intelligence arriving, in the mean time,
that D9arius had fled, the Persia41 horfemren were dif-

couragedl

door~aged, betook themselves to flight, and a great
ejamber of them were cut o~ff in the retreat. The rout
was the~n general: 8·000 -Greeks m~ade good ·their eicape.
and. retired towards Leibos. Thbe barbarians take dif-
ferent roads; some fly towards Persia; some takle refuge
in the woo~ds. T~ehe M~acedonians, in the mean time, pof-
sessed themse~lves of 3Darius's camp, w7Ehere they found
is- mother. and hib wife, together with two princesses
a~ndta son, his infant children.-T-he Persians loft a vait
pumiber of men -in this battle, w37hile the lofis on the
fi~de of the M~acedonians was very inconsiderable. Alex-
arider hirpfrelf was wiounded in the thigh by a sword I
~but ·the wound was attended with no dangerous con-

s~equences. ·'Alexander, weary of purAring Darius, returned to the
P~ersian camp, where he gave a g·rand entertainment to
his principal officers. WMhile at table, the noise of
cr~ying and mourning reached th~eir ears. This proceed-
ed crom the sh~other and wife of Darius ; who observing
Darius's chariot and bhow, which Alexander had taken
in the pursu~it, imagined Darius was killed, anrd were
betwait-ing his death in the mnift dis~consolate manner.
Alexander, moved with their misfortune, sent Leonatus,
onne of: his o~ffcers, to assure them that D~arius was alive.
But:t'he women imaginging that Leonatus came to put
-them to death, intreated to have permillion, befor'e their
'execution, to bury the body of Darius. L~eonatus
soon made them f'enfibl-e of th~eir mist~ake, and assured
them of an honourable pz-ro~teion ' frorn Altexander.
That ·lprince, after visiting the wounded, and feeing the
dead buried,. testified great joy to hris officers on ac-
-ount of his viatory ; beffowed the highest comnmenda-
tions ·on their bravery; and loarded them with presents.
He trhen went to pay a visit to Syfigamnbis and the other
princ~esses, and entered their tent with no other attend-
pat9 bu~t· his favourite Epheifton.

SIThis interview was extremely moving, and exhibited
th~ose diltinguithed charaaers in, a point of view so
.affeing, and from their situation to peculiarly interest.

gambis ex~pre~ssed the highest gratitude for the favours
and obliging attention he had thewn them; and Alex,
ander took the Eon of Darius in his arms, and caressed
him very fondly. Here the real heroifmn and virtue of
.Alexander those forth in full [~plendor. H·e gave orders
to treat the princesses with llthe re~p~eft due to their
rank, making his camp as sacred an asylum for their
virtrue as any temple;~ nor would he afterwards trust
himself in the presence of 1Dariusls n~een, sirho was a
woman~s of singular beauty. To understand the full ex-
tent of-his magnanimity on this ocation, we must re-
Tnember that Alexander wPas then in the full bloom of
youth, Unmarried, and a conqueror. But far from at-
temptmng to derive any ungenerous advantage from his
?riftory, he fludied to a~lleviate· the misfortunes of his
illuffrious captives by the most polite attention, and the
most refpediful kindness and indulgence.

Parmenio- having, in the mean time, marched to Da-

masons, receivred from the governor of that city all the
treasures deposited there by Darius for defraying the
czpensFes of his Warlike .expeditions, together with the
equipages of many Persian lords, the ·whole amounting
to anT intmetfe value. The IVMacedonian-s likewis~e found
in that city several princesses of the royal blood of Persia,
with a great number of the wive~s of the ateraps, and a
mnultitudy qs office~rs belonging to the hous~ehold of

~~Darius

rD~arius continued to fly with the utmost pr~eci-pitationr
h~ro~ugh many- defart pr~ovinces, till he crossed the Eu-
phrates, and arrived at Thapfacus. Alexander in the
menan ·time entered Syria, where most of the cities vo-
lantarily opened their gates, to him. In one of those ci.
ties that prince received a letter from Darius, couched
in fch haughty terms as but ill became his present situs
ation. W~rithout giving Alexanrder the title of king, he
ofbed him any fumn of money he thould demand as
the rwanfom of his mother, his wife, and children; and
co~imfelled him to reft satisfied with the domiriions of his
anceffors, and not to perfilt in his attempt to usurp the
kingdom of another. Alexander returned an· answer
in, the fame firain. He enumerated the misfortunes
brought on Greece by the Persians. He reproached
them with having furborned amififins to murder his father
Philip; and upbraided Darins with having offered a re-
ward of I ooo talents to any perfort who thould .kill him,
;Alexzander : he therefore concluded, that he was not
the aggressor. H~e intimated hortrever to D~arius, that
on his applying to him in a suppliant manner, he thould
receive his mother and wife without any ransom; and he
concluded, by desiring him to remember, when hbe
wrote to, him next, that he not only wrote to a king,
but to his own Aing.

UIpon Alexander's arrival in Phenicia, the Sidonians

paid: him their homage with great plearnre, because,
-eighteen years before, Ochus had deffroyed their city,
and cut off most: of the inhabitants. Their king, Stra-
to, having declared for Darius, was deprived of the
crown by Alexander, who defierd Ephaeftion to pitch
on any of the Sidonians whom he thought most worthy
of succeeding to that dignity. Epheftion ac~cordingly
offered the sceptre to two young men, who were biro.
thers, and. in whose house he; happened to lodge. But
:they generously declined the honour, because they were
nolt of the royal blood. Ephaefftion firuck with admiram
tiion at their magnanimity, begged of them to inforra
fingz of any person who had that advantage. They there-

upon

upon named Abdolon~ymus, whose generosity and inte -
grity had reduced him to foxch polerty,- that he was
obliged to' cultivate his garden with his own hands for
his subsi~stence. The. young men were desired to find
him, and to acquaint him with his good fortune. Ha-
ving accordingly gone to him, they saluted him as king,
and told him, that he must throw aside the wretched ap.
parel he then was wearing, and put on the royal robe
they had brought hlim. It was with great difficulty that
they convinced him they were not jesting. "L Affiume,"
said they, "L with there royal robes the footiments of a
C -king, preserve on the throne that virtue which has
a made you worthy of it; and when you thall preside
L .there- as the arbiter of life and death, forget not the
"C ituation from which you were exalted to that im.
"' portant dignity."

All the inhabitants of Sidon were overjoyed at· hear-

ing on whom the choice had fallen. Alexander desired
to f'ee the new king ; and having aiked him, whether
he had been able to support with patience his former
situation? "c Would-I +,Ito heven, anfiwered Abdolony-
anuts, "L I may he able to su~pport with equal resolution
*' the crown you have been pleased to place on my
L' head." Alexander conceived a high opinion of the
viriitue of Abdolonymus, and ordered all the~ furniture
and rich effetts of the late IKing Strato to. be given tos
hbim.~

'1'he only city in Phenicia which did not acknowledge

its dependence on the M~acedo~nians was Tyre, account-
edl, even before the captivity of the Jews at B~aby~lon, the
most flour~ithing city in th~e world. Its adv~antagreous si-
tuation, the induffry of its inha~bitants, the superior ex-
collence of its purple, and other commo~dities, rendered
it the centre of commerce, the richest city of the east-,
and the miffrefs of the fee.~

'The T'yrians were desirous of making Alexan~der their

JFriend, but did not cho-ose to make him their matter;s

and therefore on his offlering to enter their city,

$332 they that th~e g~ates against him, Incensed at this as*

grifrnt, Alexander resolved to take vengjeance on theria,
By lJ~aying siege to their city. This undertaking car-
rikd with it the appearance of extreme difficulty, the1
city being not only situated in an island, at the difiance
of a quarter of a league from the continent, buit ·likewise
iter strongly fortified, and the Tyrians being firmly re-
f81e~d to make an obitinate resistance. It wa-s however
d~-great importance to Alexander to get pofefi~on of
tyre, as by that means- he should command all Pherni-
cha,' thould deprive the Persians of one half of their tra-
#st3 firength, become forereign at sea, and so reduce in a
litide time both Egypt and the island of Cyprlrs. Besides
therfe motives in point of expedieney, Alexander was of
a ·difpolition that could brook no refiffance; and diffi-
cilties served only to render him more obstinate. Per-
·ceiving, however, that it would be neceffiary to confiiru£1:
biet~ween the continent and the island a mound, wihich,
it` the fame tilme that it must be a- tedious and laboriious
4crbkk, might after all be twreeped aw-ay by the violrence
of the waves; and that the other obitacles of every khrad
were very great, and might detain him too long from
the prosecution of his other enterprises; Alexander
th~ought it adv-isable to attempt an accommodation, and
threrefore sent heralds to offer terms of peace to the Ty.
rians. But initead of listening to his proposals, tire pre.
futinptuous citizen's killed ·the heralds, and threw their
bodies from the top of the walls into the s~ea. Alexan-
der, transported with rage at this insult, determined to
smdertaike the siege, whatever it might cost him.

As a circumstantial detail of the particulars of thi~s

fk~mous siege would require more room than the nature
As th~e present work will admit of, we thlall confine our-
fibes to the most remalrkable circumstances attending it.

Alexander, in the first place, ordered a foundation

to he laid for raili~ng a mound t~o communicate between
the c;ontinent and the igfand. This work was attended

iP-th incredible labour, and the~ Tyrians exerted their
5tmoft efforts to impede its exrecution. Ait laitt, how-
tiir, whben it drew towards a clos~e, a violent tempe't: a-

rising,

r~iing, overthrew by the force of the waves' the effea of
all their labours. This unfortunate accident, capable of
discouraging any other man than Alexander, had no such
effed upon him, -nor upon his iildiers, who recommen-
ced their labours with wonderful alacrity.

In the mean time the news of his viatory at Issus

brought to his aliftance a vast number of galleys frorn
different ·quarters. Sidon, Rihodes, Cyprus, and Several
ma~ritime cities in Lycia, contirbuted each its quota·;
and when to there supplies were joined the remains of
his own fleer, he appeared before T~yre with upwards of
soo galleys. The Tyrians now finding the Macedonians
superior to them in naval firength, durit no more ven-
ture~ out of their harbour. The latter, therefore, pro.
fecuted their work unmnolefied, and foon.finithed the
snole.- W~arlike engines were quickly ereaed on it;
and Alexander ordered his fleet to attack the city foro
the sea while he invefied 'it from the mole. The be-
iigedwrere over wrhelmed with thowers of stones, and the
walls of their city were incessantly battered by all forts
of engines. The Tyrians finding thems~elves thus vigo-
roufly attacked, feat away most of their women and chil-
dren to Carthage a but Rilil continued to defend themselves
with wonderful obftinacyr, and every day put in pradtice
forne new invention to fruffrate the attempts of the be-
fiegers, insomuch that Alexander deliberated more than
once about raising thefi~ege. A fea-fight at last ensued,
wherein the Tyrians were defeated, and many of their
ships funk. Alexander took advantage of the colnfter-
nation produced among the besieged by this defeat, to
give a general assault. -Both the attack and defence
were most desperate. The battering rams make breaches
in several parts of the walls The Macedonians instantly
rush forward by those breaches: Alexander exposes him-
self to the most imminent danger, performs prodig xes of
valour, and by his example encourages his soldi~ers: The
IVacedonians at last get poffeilion of the ramparts - The
T'yrians fly on all sides, are put to the sword withod~t

. d fiIndtion, and most of them pre sacrificed to the furyg

i't'he Sidonians, compaffonating the miseries of the
unhappy Tyrians, saved the lives of more than r5,ooo
of' them, by conveying them priviately aboard their thips.
A lexrander, exasperated to the highefti degree by the
lng~th and obitinacy of the siege, crucified sooo of the
'Uyrians along the sea-shore, and fold for slaves upwards
of go,ooo of them whom he had made priso~ners.
ThiEus was taken the famous city of T~yre, after a siege
offeven months duration, and one of the most mentio.
r~able recorded in ancient history.
. At this siege Alexander was wounded in the thoulder.
Darius in the mean time sent Alexanider another letter,
pafibring him rooo talents as the ransom of the prin-l
ce~eIis, wi~th his daughter .Statira in m~narriage, together
irithall the provinces 'he had conquered, as far as the-
Euphrates. Parmenio was of opinion, that Alexander
oulght to accept of. these terms, declaring, that if he
Iiire in Alexander's place, he would accept of thenu
himself= : And so would I,"' anfwrered Alexander,
L`.w~ere I Parmenio."' In answer, he informed Dariuls,
that he had no occasion for his money': Trhat with re-
[pe to the conqluered provinces, he, Darius, off~ered

ith a bad grace what ·it was not in his -power to be-
fthw; but that he might, whenever he pleased, venture
another battle, which, in all probability, would decides
whiich of them thould remain the conqueror and malter.
T~his anfiwer convinced Darius, that he h~ad now no al-
ternative but once more to try the fate of war.

Alexander, provoked against the Jews, for their ha-

I-. ving

4si ,n' the course of this Giege Al~exander having made an incurflon

irito the country of the ~Arabians who dwelt about Antilibanus, in-
;olved himself in very imminent danger from an affe~ki'onate att~ach-
·ment toc his preceptor Lysimachus, who being unabrle through age to
ke-;ep up with the reft of the party, Alexander resolved to stay behind:
vrisi~h ·him. Thus separated from the main body o~f the soldiers, they
'renainedl a whole night in a most difaggreeable situation, surrounded
b~y parties of the enemy. But by Alexander's intrepidity and good
fortuner they were extricated from their dangerous dilemma.

ving$ refuted to supply his army with provi-sions du~ring
the siege of Tyre, under pretence of an oath of fidelity
sworn by them to Dariusg. marched towards Jerufatem,
writh an intention to treat that city as he had treated
Tyre. Saddus, the high priest, hearing of his approach,
had recourse to sacrifice and prayer; and mn consequence
of a revelation made to him in a diream, cloathed himl
s~elf in his pogtifical veftmnents, and taking with him all
the servants belonging to the temple, marched out in
solemn procedion to meet Alexander. That prince, on
f~eeing the high. priest, was struck with surpris~e and re-
neration ; and co-ming up to him, saluted him wbith a re-
Eigious refpea. Hlis officers appearing confounded at
this behaviour, Alexander told them, that: it was not
the man, but the great God, whose servant he was,
whom he me-ant to honour by this refpedtful behaviourb
aifiring thern at the fame time, that before leaving Ma-
cedonia, as he was anxionfly revolving in his mind his
future expedition, he had f'een in a vision this very
high priest, dressed in the fame robes he now wore, who
encouraged him to prosecute his intended invasion of
the Persian empire, and told him, that the God whom
be ~wed·i~pped, would conduft ·his undertakings, and
crown him with viatory : That he recolleated this vision
the moment he had at this time s~et eyes on the high
priest, and that therefore he entertained no further
doubt of conquering D~arius.

It is most likely that this pre-tended dream ofAlexan-

der's ·was the child of political hypocris~y. The intention
is obvious. Alexander wished his own soldiers, as well
as the Persians, to be perfnaded that the gods had de·
ftined him to subdue the empire of the eaft;-a ele
that m~uit inspire his troops with additional confidence,
and his enemies with despair. Several other pas sages or
Alex~ander's co~ndua show viery clearly that this was a
priticipal point of policy with that prince: anld it is pro-
bable that the opinion he laboured to inspire, first of his
divine mdilion, next of his divine des~cent, and finally of
his ow-n personal divinity, gradually broached as he ad-

P wanced

. santed among more ignorant and more f~uperfittions na-
tions, contribut~ed conid~erably to his fablfequent con-
qurits. I am therefore thoroughly persuaded, -that in
propagsiting this idea Alexander was les~s prompted byr
sanity than by policy.

Alexander, delighted with the accormplifhment of this

,f1eterting predi~tion, embraced the high priest, and en-
tefiing Jerusalem, proceeded to t~he: temple, and offered
Octifices, complying in evecry partic~ular with the direco
tins of Jaddus. After which the high~ priest la~id before
hi~m h~e passages ofE Dan'iel's prophecies wvhich refpeded
hirrifelf a~nd hi-s canqaefts.

Overj~oyed at those ~wonderful prophlecies, AlPexainder

ber~ffowed many mnarks of his kindness on the J~ews, andl
:-desired them . to ;ask of hlim ~some favour. They de-
m~anded permillion to live in conformity with the laws
ciftheir fathers; and Alexander granted their request.

;Al~exander ·negt direlEded his marlch towards Gaza,
wlrhich he desired to subdue, that he might open to himr-
self a way into Egypt. But Bedis, the governor pla~ced
theire by D~arius, thought it his duty to defen~d the place
a t~h~e last extremlit~y, -by w-hi~ch means the M~aed~onian
rwrs fopped be~for~e it no less than two months. Ne
too;k it however at last; and out of refentmnent for thie
obftiniiate defence made by the inhabitants, he put I6,~ooo
ofithetta~ to the fwiird, fo~ld the reft for slaves, and in'itead%
of-ihowing that refpedt for Betis which hi-s bravery and
hie idelity to his fesvereign deserved, ofed himj witht the
abi~r~ t difracefu;l crue'lty. Commanding his feet to be
.Ii~erated, and a cord to be passed through the holes, he
sta~f~ed him to be dragged round the city till he died, as-
Fetinag to imitate Achi~es, whbo ofed the body o~f Hester:
SA t·-he Ifame manner.
·- Le;Iaving a garrison in Gaza, Alexander advanced to-
wardsi~ 1EigyTpt, and crrived before Pelui~um. The Egyp-
Ifttins Ihidadlog. ilibmnitted with impatience to the Perfianr

( bvertunent . The-y entertained a firong retentment o.f
th a·drtidty of oches, and desired nothing more arden~t-
Jitha~n an opportunity to shrow oif the yoke ·under which~ they

.they grecaned. As soon therefore as Alexrander appeared
among theml, they cheerfidly thbmitted to his authiorlty.
IVMazess, ariuSss govrernor at: Mlemphis, feeing Alexan.
der at the head of a powerful army, opened to him the
gates of that capital, and put him inl poffeffiion of 8oo ta,
lents, and all the rich eff'eAs of the king.

Every thing giving way in this manner to Alexander,

hiis heart, elated by to many. viaories, was no longer
.iroof against the baneful influence of' prosperity, which
generally corrupts the heart, and renders men blind to
their real situation. The vanity of Alexander fixggefied
to him the ridiculous projeat of imitating the example of
forne of the ancient heroes, by p~re'tending to be the son
of Jupiter. y~iTiPth tis absurd view, he resolved to payr
a visit to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, situated in the
mfidt of the deserts of Libya, at the distance of twvelve
days journey from Memphis ; and he found means pre-
vionfly to corrupt the priests, by large presents, to be-
have to himt in the manner he desired.

In this journey he observed beyond Canopus a. spot

very advantageously situated for being the foundation of
a maritime city. He gave orders therefore for immedi.
·ately beginning the work, and called ·the city after his
own name Aleandria. Its happy situation, and fine
har~bour, afterwairds rendered it one of the moRt flourish.
Ing cities in the world, and evinced the singular pen~e-
tration and comprehensive ideas of its great founder.

The journey of Alexander proved as dangerous as its

motive was extravagant; for the road lay th rough; de·
ferts covered with mountains of burning sand. The fol-
diers feeing themselves environed on all hands with
frightful deserts, were seized with consternation; and
their water having failed them, they were on the point
ofperithing for thirit, when a florm of rain commng on,
relieved them from that diffrefs. At length they arn*·
ved at the temple of thegoiuteonapoofrtt
-good ground, s~urrounded by a thick wood. The god
wasL .represented under the figure of a ram, covered with
precious itones. Alexander, on entering the temple, wats

;dii~ahite~d ss son of Jupiter by the chief priest who lif*
Thireid him, .t~hat the god hinrife~lf ackrioriedged 'himn as

tion, and hypocrisy, united in this firang4 tianfiaidioan
qiiia its ~confequenices.

A~rilexande'r conitantly, aftei: hiS rettir frortri this visit,

tifisthij3ed in all his letters ahid djifpatchies the title of Son of
SliPiter Ammon. His fubjeas privaitely piicid this ri-
Siiculous folly; but his mother Olymplas rallied hint
p~haatly enough on his vanity, be~ggng of hini hri her
18t~teis to desist fro~m promioting a quarrel betvireen Junob

Aterandeir, leaving Egypt, proceeded towards the east

:t~-irptirfd Darius. During ai thort ifay which he mnade
4th'tyrie, having be~en informed of the deaith of Statir~s,
Difarius's queeri, he immrrediatelyv paid a iri~fit to Syfigam-
tis: and the other prineeff~es 4 testified much compafiron
18t their miisfortune, omitted~ hothing that might con-
tribute to alleviate their grief, and clebrate~d the qu~een's
foherals with: vast magniaicince. D~arius, on receiving
threniewRs of his wife~'s death, f6romr a e~cnuehr who ha-d

a; is escape from the Mlacedonian cunip for that:

jhepoefe was extiemely grievedi and inqu~ired at the
(iilunch with the utmost earnefinefs, \ihe'ther A~lexarider
ad ever atte'mpted her virtue. The eunuch` afrured
fim with the most foleran oaths, that Alertainder had
lbb~itantly behiaired to Stattra wlith the utrraoft delicacy ·
-ind refpeQ; and that he had difcoviered on all oecc~-
lfions the highieft attenltion and regard fo~r th~e other
jkits~~ceffes. Darius, oil hearing this, befeeched the gods,
-ub presence of his courtiers, that if by their immuntable

Dd de-

decree the royal line of Persia was destined to fail, Aleat-
ander alonei might mount the throne of Cyrus.

: Alexander, continuing his mnarch, passed the Euphra-
stes, and adlv;an~ced ·towards the Tigris with his whole ar-
lany.- Darius ·perceiving that the M~acedonian would
ititen to no terms of accomnmodation, assembled an army
mnore numerou~s fiill than anly of the former. Th~e plains
of Mesopotamia were covered with his troops. Dasius
direaed his mnard· -through the co~untry of Nineveh ;
$utlhe *dispa~tched Mazens wivth a detachment of 6000
men to oppefe Alexrander's passage over the~ Tigr~is, the

Fnoit rapid of all the rivers of the ealf. Alexan~der, in
the mean time, having discovered a ford, effe~ted the
pass~age of his army, his foot being disposed in the
middle, and his cavalry on the two wings. The pas-
sage was attended wiith much trou~bl~e and confusion,
the sold~iers being oblig~ed to carr~y their arms and their
ba~ggge· on their heads. If Mazens had arrived in time,
the Ma~cedonians in all~p~robability might have been de-
seated: But the sin~gular good fortu~ne that attended A-
Iexander in all his enterprises, saved hi~m from this danger.

* lexrander encamped for two dalys on the farther fide
of the Tigris. As the army was preparing for their de-
parture on the third, an ecllipe of the moon happened.
Tfhis occafioned.a fuperititionrs a-latrm among the troops,
which happily, however, produaced no bad conf~equen-
aes. The soldiers conplained loudly, that to satisfy the
-amgbition of a single man, they jahould be obi~ged to tra-
vel to the extremirties of the eart-h, and th-at even con-
trary to the will of the gods, who thus refused them the
.Iight of the heavenly bodies. But uponl the soothsayers
d~eclaring, that the ·moon was the luminary wrhich fa-
voured the Persians, while on the contrary the Greeks
were patronized by the fun, ·and .that therefore' this
ecliple threatened the former with fomre imnpendin~g mif-
fortune, the ~fuperititious multictude approv;ed of the in-
·erpretation, and refuined .their: ourage. Letters in
tfhe mean timhe were int~ertepted ~wher-ein Darius endea-
v·soured, by vast promises, to perfuadie the Greek soldiers

44vantageous Itill than any of the former. Al~exrande~r
staypJeid for anfwrer, That Darius certainly pretended to
go~at: of peace with an insid~ious intention, since he was at
%hot 3very initan~t llaboalring to per~ade- h-is, A~lex~n~der's,
~sw soldiers to murder him i that therefore he was do-~
termined to ofe him not as a generouls e~enem, but as 9

elliall-~in: and he concluded with a ridicatlolus fi~gure,

8tding him, that the world ~could no more admit of two
stalkuers than it could of atwe suns.

:-arius's anny was encamsped near the vzillage of G~ase-·
~gamela, in a large plain, at Comd ~distance ifroB Arbla-,
a wty of Atlyria. Alexander, after halting fame timle
to repose his troops and to fortify his camp, there d~e*
piht~ed all his baggage, and advanced in battle-order to-
aranlds the Pe~rfans. Parmenio advised to attack ·the
etterny in the night, by which means theyi might obtain
anoreT eary viaory. But Alexander- a~nswered, that he
dfd8aiaed to Rteal a vidtory, and that he was resolved to

ht and conquer in the face of day. The army of Da-

ties passed the.night under. armhs. Alexander, after of-
Akrng~ up facrifies to the gods, retired to reit, not with-
.at~ rome anx~iety ; but falling asleep at laltt he continu-
.Isto-flieep to soundly, that they were obliged to awaken

.ar thouldt I be other wife, ince the enedhy has corne to

Arming hinfelf immediately, he mounted his horse,

ro4de through the ranks, and exhorted his. men to man>-
·taip -their fortner r-eputation. ··Never did he dikcover
donre cheerfulness or resolution. · The armyt of Dari-us,
aIcording to the most credible a~ccov~r, amoun~ted to

DBds no

no fewer that 6oo,ooo foot and 4o,ooo horse : that oif
Alexander's to no more thap 40,000- foot and between
7ooo and ·Sooni horse.. The troops on each fide were
drawn -up ~in two lines, with· the cavalry on the wings.
Twlio hundred ch~ariots, armed with scythes, were ranlged
in the front of the Persian army ; and Darius had taken
post in the centre of the foremost line. Alexander had
placed his archers at the head of his army; and to pre-
vent anyr bad effetts from his being surrounded, he gave
orders to the second line to face about in cafe they were
attackhed ini thre rear.l

The battle was begtm by the cavalty. Alexander's·

being charged by those of the enemy, sustained the first
thockr with difficulty ; but at lait were to lucky as to re-
ptrlfe them~. The Persian chariots, armed with s~cythes,
were next let loose. tUpon which the Macedonian ar--
ch~ers dikcharged a thower of arrows, that galled and
frightened the horses, and caused many of them to run
back among the Persian troops, while the Macedo-
nians opening their ranks, permitted the reft of them
to pass,

In the mean time, the soothsayer Arifiander, dreifed

In a white rebe, advancing into the midst: of the troops,
cries out, that he fees an eagl~e above Alexander's head.
This being -a presage of vi~tory, animated the troops
with fresh courage. Alexander instantly rushes forward
to s~upport ~Aretus, who had put to flight the Persian ca.
valry; and attacking, along with him, the less of the
enemy, fairly breaks them, and then advances against
she quarter ~where Datrius fought. A very bloody and
'obftinate engagement ensued. T'he soldiers about the
Persian Monarch exerted extraordinary efforts in his de-
fence. But that prince's armour-bearer being killed by
a javelin thrown from Alexand~er's own hand, the Per-
fian troops in that· winmg thinking it was the king himself
who had fallen, set rp- a frightful cry, were filled with
con-sternation, and began to give ground. D~arius, a-~
fr~aid of falling into -the hands of the Macedonians, conr-
Aders his safety byr flight. A dreadful slaughter follo~wed.

~i:the mean time, however, the left of the Macedonianrs,
~cmnaladed by Parmenio, was in great danger. A de-
~i hment of the Persian cavalry having forced their way
irough them, galloped up to the ·very baggage. But
the infantry in the centre of the r'econd line facing a-
pat~t, attacked this body of cavalry in the rear, and obli-
ged thfem to retreat. The danger, however, was not

ye ove. Mazens nexrt fell upon them, with all the ca.

waiy under his comm~and. Alexander, informed of the
dkinger that threatened Parmenio, returned from purfu-
ifng Dariu-s, hurried to support his: own troops, and falling
in with the body of cavalry that had made the attempt
.on the camp, charged thbem with the greatest vigou-r.
Tjhe battle was very obstinate. Alexander lofl fixsty of
his guards ; but, at lengthl, the Persians were repulsed
and put to flight. On the other hand, Mazeus hear-ing
of~ the: flight of Darius, and of the defeat of the troops
that had fought about the king's person, was to con-
founded at the news, that he gave over the pursuit of
the ;Macedonians, whom he had thrown into great dif-
order. Parmenio observing this change in the 'conduft
of Mazeus, called out to his troops, that the enemy was

z~ed with a panic, and that one bold effort would iner

foire them the viatory. The M~acedonians, animated by
his information, advance against the enemy, charge
them ~with irresistible fury, and put them to flight. A-

an~rder perceiving that viaory every where declared

fer-him, returned to the pursuit of Darius, whom he
expedted to find in Arbela, where great part of his
thathres were deposited. But Dariuss, afraid to flop
there, abandoned the city, together with an immense
boty, to the Macedonians.
-i:Such was the event of this famous battle, in
wphic·h the Persians are said to have loft 300,000 33 r.
then; and t~he Macedonians no more than 200.
L~ilexander, after expressing, by proper sacrifices, his gra-
tiltude to the gods for this great viaory, diffributed mag-
sificent presents among the officers who had principally
distinguished themselves. He express~ed particular ratis+

Dd y faatior4

fettion with~ the conduat of his Greeki soldiers; aznd~, by~
way of recompence, ordered all the Greek cities to ber
set at liberty, and everyT species of tyraorucal government,
then prevailing among them, to be abolithed.

D~aries, paiffng the river Lycus, hurried towards M~e-

aia, by the way of the mountains of Armeniaj attended
by a very slender retinule.

AlYexander havintg takien poffeffion of Arbela, found,

in thrat city, 4coo talents of money, (near-ly L. boo,ooo
Sterling), and other treatures to an immense value.-~
lFrom A~rbela. h marched to B·abyl~on, th~ere Mlazeus
mad~e his fubiirniRons, and delivered up the city. Mrofit
of the Babylonians, impatient· to fee their new matter,
Pment out of the city to meet him. Alexan~der made hi's
entry at the head of his army. The walls of Babylon,
to celebrated in hif~o~ry, were covered with muti'tudes
6f fpeaators; the· roads were firewed with flowers by
order of the governor of the citadel; and on both sides
of the way altars were ere~ed, whereon were burnt
perfames: of an exquisite flavour. Immediately behindl
th2e reti~nue of Al-exander were carried the presents de-
fflined· for- him; among which were many wild beasts,
thch as lions, panthers, &c. confined in cages : N~ext
canie the Ma~igi singing hymns ; then the Chald~eans,
soothsayers, mplficians, and the Babylo~nin borfemen:
Al~exander waas mounted on a chariot s~urround~ed by his
guards, and marched along· in triumph. He diltributed
a great part of the money found in Babylon in preifene~s
among his soldiers; every Matcedonian hors~eman recei-
ving about L. 1 3 Sterling; every other horseman about:
LP. 4; and every foot Soldier about L. 2.

SAs Alexander poifef~Fed an extraordinary taste fbr the

sciences, he pafIed s~ome time in conversation with the
Chaldeans, who entertained him with their m~ost c-
riotts affronomical ob~ser~vations. He Rtaid thirty-four
datys in Babylon. H;is residence in this city, wvhich was
thren irmnerfed in Isrury and every species of voluptu-
oufners, greatly corrupted his trsooprs. Whle at Baby.r
lon, he was joined by a nurlner oferut nthmb

Antipater. Alexander departing at last from Babylone
·entreird the province of Sitacena, a very fruitful coun;
tiy, Here, to keep up a spirit of emulation among his
fiskiers, he appointed rewards to be difkributed among
the soft valiant by the officers who had been witnes~ses
of the bravery displayed by each of them in the several
btitles. Here, too, he made some· neceiary alterations
is. his military dilcipline. Then he proceeded towards
fiefa, a city in Per-sia, and arrived there on the twen-
tieth day after his departure from Baby~lowz 'The gover-
nor of the province sent his son to meet him, and fol.
lowed soon after hims~elf, wcith a present consisting of
ddromedaries and twelve elephants, which he delivered
to Alex~ander on the banksa of the river Choarpus, so
celebrated in biitory for the delicious taite of its viraters.
Aleander enterinig Susa, found there 50,000 talents of
money (upwards of L. 6,000,000 Sterling), and rich
furcniture and effe~ts to an imnmedre value. B~efore quit-
ting Susa, Alex~ander put a garrison into that city, con-
[dting of 3000 men and 1 000 of his veteran Macedomian
soldiers. He likewvife left there Syfigambis and Dac
aps's children, and made that princess a present of fomae
breamtiful purple fluffs that had been sent him from Ma-

dcon-ia. For Alexander constantly behaved to her
~pith as high refpeAt as if the had been his own mother ;
and so far conformed himfeslf even to the Persian man-
pprs, that he never fat down in her presence till the
ga~ve him permiflion.

Alexander next advanced into the country of the
xt~i~i; whbere, after eft~ablithing his authority, he comb

ynitted the greatest part of his army to Parmemio. 'Ta-
Zcing none but the light-armed troops along with him-
self, he penetrated into Persia through the mountains
t-ill he reached the pass of Sus~a. Ariobarzanes, with
4+00 mnen, having taken poff~effon of the rocks that
commanded that pass, rolled ~down from the top of, them
la~rge fitones, which cruihed to pieces many of the _Ma-
tieonians; who finding it impom~ble to proceed, were
obliged to flop thort in the midst of their viatorious ca-

'D d ~4 rect.

reer. In th'is'dilemma, a Greek offered to conduat the
~Macedonians by a secret unfrequented path to the fum-
mitii of those rocks. Alexander accepted of his s~ervice;
and taking along with him a good part of his troops,
set out on the attempt. But they met with incredible
difficulties in their way, and narrowly efeaped perithing
am~ong the fnow.r Arriving, however, at the top of the
mountain at last, and difoo~verizig the main body of the
enemy, he instantly attacked and cut them in pieces.
'Whereupon Craterus, whom he had left at the bottom
of the hill with the reft of the troops, took poffeff~ion of
the pass, and put the enemy to flight.;

Alexcander having extricated himself from this dan-

gerous situation, advanced towards Persepolis, the an-
clent residence ors he P~ersian monarchs, and the capital
of their~ empire, where a part of Darius's treasures were
deposited. After passing the Araxus, he was mhet, not
far from Persepolis, by about 800 G~reeks, all old mren,
who having been formerly made prisoners by the Per.
Hans, had been by theml maimed and disfigured in
their bodies with the most thockring inhumanity. They
came to implore the protc~ion of Alexander; who, on
feeing their miserable situation, could not refrain from
thedding tears. H~e did all in his power to comfort
them; and offered to prolcure them a paifage home to
their native country. But: the Greeks told him, that,
in their present frightful condition, they durst not ap-
pear in Greece; and that, besides, they were unable
to s~upport the fatigue of to long a journey. Alexrander,
therefore, consented to let them stay in the fame place,
where they had already spent: so many years; and after
presenting each of them with three dirachmas, four oxen,
and five faits of cloaths, he ftriatly enjoined the go-
vernor of the province carefully to protea them from
all bad usage for the future ; and granted them an ex.
emption from every kind oif tribute.

Most. of the Persians abandoned Persepolis on the spo

·piroach of Alexander, who entered it at the head of his
phalan9c. The soldiers, recalling to their remembrance, `'that

That it was from this city those immense armies of Bar-
barians had proceeded, who had fipread devaffation
tohrough Greece, were seized with a furious spirit of re-
ientmient, and cut in pieces .the remaining inhabitants.
·;Che treasures amassed in this city greatly exceeded all.
shat' had hitherto fallen into thbe hands of Alexander.
Oine would have imagined that the whole riches of Per-
ha had been here collefted together.. For besides es-
felts of inettimable value, near L~. r 6,000,000 Sterling
were found in the royal treasury. This city was indeed
the fountain of the Asiatic luxury. ]Besides the cities
already mentioned, Alexander had got poffefiron of fe-
veral other very rich towns; and in particular, he had
fornd- at Paf'agardtts alone near L. 900,000 Sterling.

W rih'ile Alexrander remained at Persepolis, he gave a

grand entertaimrixent; at which, besides other ladies,
;i cotfrtezan named Thais, a- native of Attica, happen-
ed to be present. In the height of their jollity, this
Thais having indifereetly declared, that the would
sincduent it a very great happiness to have the pleafore of
setting fire, with her own hands, to the palace of Xerxes,
the greate'it enemy of Greece, and the defiroyer of A-
thens, all the courtiers highly applauded the thought,
ahd Alexand-er himself among the firit. The whole
company, therefore, instantly snatching up burning
torches, mufhed out; and in a moment reduced that
magynificent palace to athes. A piece of extravagant
fly, for which Alexander repented very sincerely as-
terwards.

Darius had by this time reached Echatona, the capi-

tail of Media, Of all his mighty forces, ·no more than
goiooo ·now remained with him; among whom were
4000 Greeks, 4000 archers, and 3ooo horse, com-
manded by Befitsu, fratrap of Baftriana. The unhappy
inonarch, assembling his officers, returned them thanks,
in the most moving manner, for having: adhered to his
fortunes, and for not having deserted him like the reft s
a fidelity for which the gods, he told them, must cer-
taily reward them, though, perhaps, it might never

be

be in his power. He affnread them, at the fame time,
~that, with: their afrdtance, .he would stilt boldly face the
enemy; that, for himself, he never would· submit to
the conqueror; and that they had the means .of defence
in their arms and valo~ur. Most of the officers applaud,
ed this heroic refolution;j and affared him, that they
would fplend the last drop of~ their blood in his s~ervice.
B~ut Beffus had already formed a traiterous conspiracy

~i~th ~a~barzanes co~mmander of the horse, to se~ize the
p~erson of 1Darius, and either to deliver him up to Alex-
ander, if so warmly pursu~ed that they could not hope to
escape, or,- in. cafe of escaping, to put: him to death,
and to usu~rp the forereignty in his place. In profecu.
tion of their plan, the traitors perfixaded a part of their
soldiers to support their mea~sures, by telling them, that
they were ori the point of falling into the hands of Alex-
ander. D~arius got intelligence of'this· on~fpiracy; and
it is easy· to imagine what extreme sorro~w he must have
felt on that occafxon. Patro, the commra-nd~er of the
G~reeks, and ·a man of fk~riat honouar, thocked at to bas~e
anr inflance of treachery, preffted Darius to commit the
care of his person to. his Greek soldiers, who~se faithful
~attachm~enrt he had often exrperienced. But Darius de.
clined the offer, that he might not .affront his natural,
born -Tabjeas, by trbi~n g his safety to ~it rangers in prel
fernene to ·them., That ·unfortunate m~on~arch soon be-
came a vidim to. this tendernes~s for the P-ersians. The
traitors·fei-;e~d him, and :condnated him in a covered
chqriot- towards Baatriana.

~Alexander arriving at ·Ech~atana, caused to be depo-

fated, ·in the -citadel, all the treasures he had found in
Pediia, amounting, by Strabo's account, to about
L. n-,5oo,oco Sterling. Then he ordered Parmenio
t o mrch towards Hi~ircania with the Thracians and the
reh ·of the cavalry; ·and ·sent orders to Clites, who had
beentlefi ~behind ·at: Susa, to come and join him in Par.
shia. I~n the mean time ~Alex~and~er himfjelf went in pur-
fuitr of·Dar~ius, who had left Echatana only five d-ays be.
.fore. Arriving at the Caspian defile, he encamped there,

tkete, and hakted all next day. ·Here he received in-
itg~ene, that· Darius had pathde the defile, w~as faiited
gly he traiorsrr, and wias draggedt about in a chariot by'
gaguei. Aletand~er, thocked at the newrs, -haened· his
ng~eb. The barbarians, thoug9h uperior in numbeks,
~~lis. ot courage to fland their ground, but fled tvhen
the heard of his appro~ach. Beiss ~o~rered Darie~s t
get op horseback, the more eardy to efeape fromi his
enemires. But th~at prince refused to c~omply, telling
Befits, that the gods were sending hi·m an avenger hn
the p2erson of Alexander. Beiffs and his acc~ompi~ces,
enritged at this anfwKer, discharged their arrows at birSm 3
as& aving wounded himt m~ortally, thuey anid thek* fol-
diesc dispersed by different .roasts.

The~1 advateced guard of Alexander\s army found Da-

ot d~atrh. H~e had still firen~gth enough~ left to deSire

Darius at his death was not fifty years of age, and of

that time he. had reigned only fix. He was a prince of
a mild disposition, In his person ended the Persian
elhpire, after having flood so6 years under thirteen
kings, viz. Cyrus, who was the founder of it, Camby.
f~es, Smerdis the: magian, Darius the son of Hyffafpis,
Xgerxes 1. Artaxerxes Longimanus, Xerxes II. Sogdia-
nus, Darius NSothus, A~rtaxeyrxes MNnemon, Ochus, Ar-
fes8, Darius Codomannus.

The Persian empire was originally composed ·of two na-

tions totally dissonant to each other both in their tem-
pers and manners. The Persians led a s~ober hardy life;
the ~Medes were effeminate and luxurious. the manners
of the latter quickly corrupted those of the fdrrmer; and
the attention. of both was solely dire~ced to pleasure, and
mag~nificence. The conquest of Babylon by Cyrus
contributed greatly to this pernicious change, by sup-
plying him with all the means of luxury and refinerment.
The Persians were to thoroughly degenerated from the
original virtue ·of their forefathers, that of all the people
on earth they wer~e the soft addiated to luxury and
volsptuouiiefs,~ the most overbearing, haughty, cruel,
and per Sdious. Add to this, that after the unfuccefsfur
enterprises of Darius and Xerxes against Greece, they
gave themselves wholly up to indolence and sloth. Mi-
litary discipline being quite negleAed, their ar mies

for thaking off the Macedonian yoke; and they formed
t confederacy for that purpose with most of the Rtates of
the Peloponnes~e. Antipater, receiving intelligence of
thii~ereproceedings, returned with all possible expedition,
aiid led his troops againlt the Laeddemonians. The
anntiy of the latter amounted altogether to no more than
icijooo foot and sooo horse, while the troops of Anti-
pa~t~er wiere double that number. An engagement en-
feaed. Both parties fought with extraordinary bravery,
an~d the a~tion was most thar~p and obitinate. But An-
tipater, having by an affe~ted flight drawn the enemy
thto plainer ground, where he could more effeatually
emiploy all his firength, gained the vinorjr at last. King
Agis fell fighting· valiantly, after having performed a-
ftnifhinig fats of bravery. The Lacedemonians loft
morie than 30oo men, and the power of Sparta was
thereby irretrievably ruined. Antipater communicated
th~e news of this vilaory to Alexandler in very modest
tfcints, from an apprehenilon of exciting his jealoury.

wi~th equal celerity, he conquer-ed the Mard~es, Arii,
and several oIcther Inations. ~Abou·t this time Nabar zanes

'Theni he set off towards Bac~triana, where he still liad
much danger amd fatigne to ~undergo.

It vitias abou~t this tiatie that the pretended cone

S3o.0 fpiracy of Philotas happened. Alexander impu-

ted it as a crime to that officer, who was the son

of Parmenio, th~at he had not iniformetd him oaf a con-
fpiracy aigainft his life by one Dymnus, who had volunr
tarily put himself to death just as he wais on the point
of being -apprehended.i Philotas was tried by an assembly
of the whole army, and, in spite of the firongeft rea-
sons alleged by him in his juffification, was condemned
to the most cruel torture. The intenseness of the pain:
not only extorted from hini a confeffion that he himself
wars guiltyj 'but even that hnis father was concerned in
the plot. `He was condemned and executed after the
manner of the MPdacedonrians;- being stoned to death.

It is true, that forne parts of the former behaviour of

Philotas had given umbrage to Alexander; and that his
baughtiniefs had procurecd him many enemies, of whom',
unfortunately for him., several were his judges. BIut it
Is uncertain whether Alexsander really believed P~artilenio
to be guilty, or whether \his f~ubferquent treatment of
him did riot rather proceedi from a dread of the resent-
me~nt of so able a commander for the cruel inijuffice done
to his son. How~ever that might be;, he resolved, inr
spite of the'numberlefs important services performed for
him by that excellent officer, to sacrifice him to his
quiet and s~ecurity; and for -that purpose he dispatched
Polydamnus into Media, where Parmenio then com-
manded, with private infiru<Rions to the. governor of the
province, and the principal off~icers.

All the proper measures being accordingly concerted,

`those to whom the exrecution was intruffed went ter
Parmenio, whom they found walking in his park, and
presented him with a letter as if from Philortas. The old
general immediately began to inquire very anxionfly a-
bout the king, and to expref's the highest admiration
at his furrpifing attivity ·in pushing his conqluefts. But

while thus' profusely beltowring pra~ises on Al~etander,
the venerab'le old man is, by the orders of that fame
~~t9anlexdr, .bar~ely affaffistuated. Thus were rewardied
the important services and inviolable attach~ment of at
m~an s~eventy years old, who had coulitand~y assisted Alex-
aln~der with his best advice, and witholzt whom it is high.
3j <probable that the warlike operations of that prin~ce
nIev~er would have been attended with diich futcce~s ; andi
·this ungrateful and inhuman treatment was inflifted -o'n
no~ better 'ground than a mast improbable s~uspicion, un-
forpported by any evridence. This is one of the aaliols
th~at has thrown the deepest slain on ~the `memory of
Ale~xander.

Alexander persisted in his perfeit rof Befir~s; in ·the

course of which he had many fatigues to undergo, inanyr
comitries to travers~e, and many dangers to encounter.-~
The news of his approach deter-mined the Biad~rians to
defec-t BeiIfus, to whom they had hitherto remained ~firm-
~lii iitached. Beffiss, therefore, was forced to betakte
hinde~lf to flight; and pafmug the river Oxus, he too~k
refuge in Sogdiana ~with a fna'll body of troops. Ale~It-
.and~er having purs~ued him thither?, S~pitamnenes, the ac-
somnplice and confi~dent of Beilins, formed a conspiracy
o6f the eprincipal officers atgaRint him, s~eized him, loaded
hBim with chains, and delivered him up to Ale9an~der.
-That :prince highly commended the behaviour of Spita-
·trene~s; and ordered Beffis to be delivered over to
A xatr-es the brother of Darius, to be ofed with all the
ignbminy he deserved·. B4ut his punishment was de-
layied tilli he thould be tried in an affemnbly of the
Perfiain s .

it was during his pursuit of Beffiuss that AlexanderL

certsmitted an adtion of the greatest in~juffice and cruelty
that occurs in -hiffo~ry. H-Ze cadfed all the inhiabitants
:o~fa finall city where the Branchidie: resided to be put to

Eixo~nfirations of joy. And for what caufTe this un-
`provoked inhumranrityz ?Under preten~ce that ·the an-

Ee cleflors

were the guardians,

Alexander penetrated still farther and farther into

Baariana in .search of new conqueits. Upon his arrival
at the Jaxactes he was attacked by a barbarous people,
who ruthing -down upon him ftom the mountains, made
some of ~his men prisoners. Alexander· resolved to force
them from their firong holds; but in the attempt was
wounded i~n the lSeg by an arrow, and carried off to his
tent. The barbarians, aftdnifhed at the bravery with
which they had seen him fight, believed him to be a god,
and s~ent amlrbaffadors to make their fubmiirons.

Havingf next made himself matter of Maracanda the

capital of Sogdiana, he still continued his progrers, rava-
ging the country. In there parts he received an embaffyr
from the Abian-Scythians, a poor nation, who placed
their chief glo~ry in the praatice of justice, and never
madle war but in their own defence. Tlheyr sent to in-
form Alexander that they submitted to him;· and he re-
ceived them under his prote~iio~n. But in the mean
time, the Sogdians and Baarians having-revolted at the
infligation of Splitamenes, Alexander resolved to punish
~their. treachery and that of their leaders. Laying
siege therefore to Cyropolis the utnioft city in the
Persian dominions, he took it by assault, and gave it urp
to be plundered. Then he befiged the city of the lMe-
maconians, who had put to death fifty of his horsemen,
whom he had s~ent to them with friendly intentions.
The besieged made a moss~ desperate resistance. Many
ogf Aklexander's best soldiers perished in the enterprize;
and he himself narrowly es~caped being killed by a. stone.
As difficul'ties frerved only to heighten his courage,
he proceeded with more vigour than nfual; and ha-
ving made a breach in the'wall by means of a mine, en-
tered the city, and deffroyed every thing with fire and
iiword. He treated Several other cities of Sogdiana in the
fam~e mariner, to punih their revolt. The~n he cau-

W~Thile his army was employed at the work, the king

of the Scy thians, taking uinbrage at this new settlement,
fZent an army to interrupt thIeir operations, and to drive
away the Macedonians; and about the fame time a detach-
ment that had been fecnt to Maracanda against Spitame-
nes was cut in pieces. 'This threw Alexander into
forne perplexity ; but he inflantly formed his refoln-
tioiz, and assembling hris troops, encouraged them by a.
harangue to pass the Jaxartes. Iln the mean time,
twenty ambassadors arriving from the Scythians were in-
·troduced into the tent of Alexan-der, where theyr delivrer-
ed the celebrated speech recorded by nlintus Curti~us,
which is s~o much admired for its folaidty, .ingenuity,
and fimplicit'y; and it is perhaps the belt piece of com-
polition to be, met with in the whole work of that fro-
thy writer.--There Scythian ambassadors are~ made to
addres~s thems~elves to Alexander ·in very plain terrms.
They call him without any ceremony a robber, zeiho em-~
ployed himplf in making~ rar on people who had never in-
~jured him. "' You (f~ay they), who boast of your co-

"ming to exterminate robbers, are yourfeclf the greatest
"c robber in the world.- You have plundered all the na-·
"C tions whom you have subdued. Are not these who
CC live in the woods to be exempted f~omn knowing you,
C' and from feeling your violence ? If you are a god,
" asy~ou fa yo r, you ought to do good ,to mankind.
* fyu r man, you ought to hearken tor the dilat~es
CL of reason and humanity."

To this s~peech· Alexander- made a very short answer,

telling the ambassadors, that he would make the proper
bire both of his own good fortune and of their advic~e,
He persisted,· howaever, in his former resolution, and
transported his army over the Jaxartes on rafts. This
was a bold undertaking. The rivrer was very rapid,
and a powerful army appeared on the opposite bank
prepared to dispute their landing. The passage ·accor-
dingly was attended with much d~ifficuzltyj the Mlacedo-

Eez mians

nians being obliged to engage before they could make:
good their landing. But the good fortune of Alexanrr-
der fourmo~nted~ all obitacles. The biarbarians, unable
to sustain the thocks of the ~Maced~onian caval~ry, were:
brokeri and put to flight. Alexand~er loQ In the amion
sixty horsemen. The fame of this viAory obtamned over
the Scythians made the IVacedonians to be regarded as
invincible.

Alexa-nder, eager to get hold of Spitamenes, returned.

towards M~lara~canda; but S-pitamnenes fled on his ap-
proach. H~aving ·sacked the city of Sogdiana, he found
there, among other prisoners, thirty young men of ex-
traordinary beauty, with whose fortitude he was no les~s
delighted than with their fine appearance; for they tef-
tified unthaken resolution on hearing that they were to
be put todeath. Alexander asked them, whether they
would accept of life, on condition of engagmng an his
service. The young men con~e~nted, and afterwards
served him wit~h great 6idelity.--From thence he pro-
ceeded- to Baatria, where he catrfed the nose and ears
of Beffo~is to· be cut off, and then sent him to Echatana.
There the traitor's four limbs welrre tied- to as many.
bended trees,, which tore his body In pieces.

About this time Al~exander received a reinforcement

of a6 6,00 men from Maced~onia, with whole afifitance
he wa~s enabled to ifubdue the reft of the country of Sog-
diana, of which only one place called Petra Oxianac
now held out. This being a firong fort, rituated in the
face of a sl~eep rock, inacceilble on all sides -except by
one narrow path, and being defended by a pokwerful
garrison, its governor would liffen to no terms of fur-
render.--Any person but Alexander would have thought
it madness to attempt the attack of fiich a place; but he
loved to contend with obltacles that appeared infurl
mount able. ~-Sele~tbing therefor e 3 o .of his mo(1 a~ive
soldiers, he commanded them to climb this rock in the
most 'acceflible place. They complied with the orders
of their 'king; but abo~ix thirty~ of the-m loft: thei'r lives
in the en-terprise -by fa~llng from the p-recipices.--At last,

how-

.bowever, after incredible labour and .difficulty, they
reached the summit of the rock, and dilplayed the ap-e
pointed signal to the M~acedonians below, who thereup.
cjn pointed out to Arimazus the governor of the place,
die foil~diers who had taken post on the top of the rock
above~ him. At the fame time the whole army thouted

for oy.Arimazus, aftoniihed at the boldness of Alexl

ander's troops, thought himself undone, and offered to
deliver up the place, on the s~ole condition of having the
lives of himself and his garris~on Spared. But Al~exander
ref~ixed to grant him even that; and having got posses-
iion.·of the place, he crucified him at the foot of the
Srock.

Then Alexander subdued the country of the M~assa-

getae and Dahae. In this country having been attacked
by a lion when hunting, he killed the furious animal
w Jith one firo~ke.

On his return to Maracanda he gave a grand enter-

tainment ; at which being fluffered more than ordinary
by the great quantity of wine he had drunk, he boast-
ed very highly of his own exploits, undervalued exceed-
ingly those of his father, and even ridiculed some pas,
faiges of Philip's life. The oldelt officers who had .ferL
ved under Philip were much offended at this behaviour;
and Clitus in particular, who had sa-ved Alexander's
life at -the battle of the Granicus, could not conceal his
diffatisfaftion. It is true, that Clitus carried the matter
too ~far ; for, not satisfied with extolling to the skies the
alkions of Philip,~ and setting them far above those of
Aliexanrder, he was rath enough to enter on the defence
ofPar~menio's memory, in~ifted on the particulars of his
tragical fate with great acrimony, and concluded with
ablerving, that the offi'cers of Aelexander might judge
from thence what fort of reward they had to exupe~t: for
their past services. Alexander, though much. exafpe-
.tated, retained his passion for some moments, and com-
mnanded ~Clitus to leave the room. C~litus accordmngly
rising up, exclaimed, addrefling himself to Alexander,
~' I fee plainly you can no longer endure the converfa-

Ee 3 "CfOtio

** tion of men who are free ; and that you desire rather
CL to live among, slaves, dis~posed on all occaflons to pay
<C homage to your Persian- robe." Atlexander, unable:
any longer to, contain himse-lf, fPeized a javelin to kill
Clitus; b6ut some of the guests interposed and prevented
him, while· others forced Clitus away.---A little while
after, however, Clitus having returned singing verses
Injurious to Alexander, the enraged prince sprang for-
wards, transfixred him with a javelin, and threw hilm to

the ground ; exclaiming, Go, then, and join

S2 8. "L Philip and Parm~enio." But feeing Clitus

dead, he was inflantly firuck with horror at what

he had done, refleaing, that he had killed a man to
whom he owed his life, and· that for a few imprudent
words which the power of wine alone had made hira
utter. ~Transported with g~rief, he threw himself on the
body of Clitus; and seizing the javelin with· whiich he
had killed him, attempted to plunge it into his own
body. But his friends prevented him, and carried hira
into his chamber by force. There he continued nearly
two days firetched on the floor, weepigadlmnig
and determined to let himfielf perifhin ofd hunger. Bu
the sooths~ayer· Arifiander, assis~ted .by the philosophers
Callifthenes and Anaxarchus, argued him out of this
resolution. This tragical event exhibits a very signal
proof of the dreadful effeas of drunkenness and anger;5
and shows the' great importance of early avoiding those
anoft dangerous vices, which obscured all the glory of
Alexander's splendid aRtions, aidd enslaved that great
conqueror of so ~many nations.

Alexander havingf in a golod mneafiure recovered fkom

his grief, again took the field, subdued a province on
the borders of Scythia, and got poffeilion of the rock
Chariana, though not without very great labour and
difficulty. It was after this expedition that the· wife of
Spitamnenes, after endeavouring in vain by every fort of
intreaty to persuade her husband to make his peace
with Alexander, murdered him at. last during the night,
and brought his head to that prince j who, ibocksed at

so horrible an sation in a woman, ordered her to be dif-
aditerd with ignominy. Still continuing his march, heb
vass overtaken by a dre~adlful fiertm, which was fiacceed-
ed i·by weather so excessively cold, that more than Ioob
soldiers died of it; and i~f Alexander had not: given or.
Bers to cut down a great number of trlees, and to make
fires of themi, the whole ar~my must: have perished.

;Arriving in the country of the Sacas, he was received

in a molk refpeatful and magfnificent: manner by O~xi-
artes their king, whlo gave him a grand e·ntertainment,
at which his daughter Roxana was present. This lady,
besides the most exqluifite beauty, poffeffed· a igreat deal
of gaie'ty and wit, and captivated Alexander· so highly,
that he made her his wife. But the· marriage gave much
diffatisfa~tion to the Miacedonians.

Alexander, insatiably bent on conqueit, resolved to

penetrate into the Indies, which was accounted the
richest country on earth. Wiith this view he ordered
the thields of his soldiers to be indented with plates of
silver, their coats of mail to be adorned with gold, and
the bridles of the horses to be gilded. But before set-~
ting out, he resolved to- put in execution a sc~heme that
he had long revolved in his mind, namely, to obtain di-
vine honours to be paid him by his soldiers. For this
purpose he .gave a molt magnificent entertainment, to
which he invited his whole court, as well G~reeks and
M~lacedonians as Persians. After remaining Some time
at ·table him~self, he retired. Then Cleon, one of the
m~ost se~rvile of his flatterers, in consequence of a pre-
vious concert, began a pompous oration ; m which he`
expatiated on the wonderful merit and extraordinary ex-
ploits of Atlexrander, enumerated with extreme oftenta-
tion the many obligations conferred by him on all who
were preifent, and concluded with a propofagl to ac-
knowledge him for a divinity. For this he cited the
example of former great conquerors placed among the
number of the gods, fach as Hercules and Bacchus. He
'aired the company, that, on Alexrander's returning,
hte· hfimfelf would be the first to salute him as a god; and

E e4 he

he exhorted a~ll the other guests, and particularly the
best and wifelt among them., to follow his example.
By these last words he -hinted. at the philosopher Cal.
lifthenes, a man very highly esteemed for his knowledge
.· i~n the sciences, and ·for the purity of his manners. Cal.

lifthenos: perceiving· the eyes of the whole company fixedi
on him,.flood up, and made a fpelech > in which, after
observing that tire king himsel~f, if he had been present,
would -never have permitted Cleon to utter such gross
flattery, he ded~ared, that though that prince was wor-
thy the highest: honour and praise, yet there was an im-
mense difference between the honour merited by the
most, perfell mortal and the worthip drie to the almighty
gods; that to the last, no man living could ever be in-
titled, nor could presume to ~accept that divi~ne title, till
he had thrown off mortality ; that the ·pra~tice of the
Persians, which had been urged as a precedent by Clel
on, ought on many accounts to be of no weight here,
Eince it was improm~ble that the vanquished could ever
give law to the vi~tors. Alexander, who was concealed
in an adjoining apartmnent, overheard every syllable of
what patt ;. and returning soon after into the hal~l of en-
tertainm-ent, was immediately adored by the Persians.

Callifthenes soon received the reward of his generous

fTentiments. A plot having been discovered against: the
life of Alexander, whereof one Hermnolaus was the prin-
cipal author, Callifthenes -was comprehended in .the
number of conspirators. on account of his friendship
with Hermolaus, was thrown into prison, and put to the
torture; under the torments of which he expired, pro-
testing his innocence with his last breath. W~hat hor.
rid barbbarity ! This inltance of unjust vengeance is a
per~petual diihon-our on the, chara~ter of Alexander.
Se-neca calls it with gre~at .juffice, an eternal reproach,
end a crime that never can be wiped out by the great-
eit talents and mott t~hining exploits : C For (adds
"S the philosopher), if we _mention Alexander's having
"C slain, with his own hand, a coo Persians; ·his having
f;dethroned the most pownerful king in the world ; his

a" hat

ckahfaving penetrated to the ocean ; still the remembrance
** et his having unjustly· murdered Caifthenes will ~re.
*L -cari upon our minds, and efface the splendor of all
*L thoaft- great a~ions."

Independent of the eager desire for conquelt enter-

tained by Alexander, he had learned from the fabulous
traditions of the Greeks, that Hercules and Bacchus,
both sons of Jupiter, had carried their arms into the In-
dies; which, of itself, was a fufficient motive for him to
undertake the: fame expedition. The danger and d~ifi-
cu~lty that attended such an enterpris~e, wras to Alexan-
der an additional motive itill. WJe will not pretend to fayB
how far his con~dua. in that refp~ed was justifiable. But
thus far we may venture to aiftrt, that true glory never
can consist in increasing human mlfery, too great al.
ready through the unavoidable. accidents of life, by dif-
Infing ruin and deftruaion over the face of the earth,
and wantonly dilturbing the peace and quiet of man-
kind.

As soon as Alexander entered India, many petty so-
vet;eigns paid him their homage and obedience. One
nation, however, had the courage to oppose him. But
they were defeated after a flight engagement ; and A-
lexander, to firike terror into others, who might be in-
clined. to follow their example, besieged their capital
city,. took it, and put adl lhe inhabitants to the fw~Jord.
Thena he marched against the city of Nyfus, which fizr·-
rendered at diferetion. Atind now nothing was hear~d of
but the daily redu~ation of cities on all sides, and that in
spite of a thousand difficuties. 'But Alexander thr.
mounted every obt~acle of art and nature, by fuchi an
uninterrulpted series of good fortune, as appeared alt~o.
g~ether fuppernatural. Happening to be wounded in the
leg by an. arrow, at the siege of one of those towns na~-
med· Magof/a, the: pain extorted from him there rerrark-
abl~e. words : C' The- whole wvorld canis me the son of
R 1CJup~-iter, but this wound makes me sensible that I am
Cr Rhill a man."'
SArriving at th-e ri~ver Indus, he passed it without any

d if,

dificdt~ty, the necessary preparations having been made
by Epheftion, who had gone before *for that purpose.
The king of that country, named T'azvilusl, came to meet
him, and put into his power both his person and domni.
nions, "~knowking (as he said) that Alexander fought only
QL forL glory."2 On being afkied by Alexander, wrho was
h~ighly pleased with this address, of what he flood most
in needl ? he answered·, L. Of soldiers ;"' beca~use he had
a; war to maintain against two· neighbouring kings, Abi.
fares and Porus; of whom the latter, who lived beyond
the Hydafpes, was the most powerful. Taxilus sen~t a
preSent of fifty elephants to Alexander, who, in return,
beffowed on that prince magnificent ma-rks of his
bounty.c

A~FSbifares fol~lowed~ the example of Taxilus, and se~nt

ambtaffadors to put all his dominions under the power
and proteation of Alexrander. But Poruls was a prince
of lentiments too generous and elevated to flcoop to so
mlean a behaviour. Alexander, surprised at neither re.
celving a visit from Porus himself, nor from any person
inr his name, sent to inform him that he must pay him
tiribuzte, and come in person to mak~e his· C ubmii~ons.
Porus sofwered, that if he were to pay him a visit, it
Mould be with his arms in his hand. Ailexander then
a~dvuanced to the river Hydafpes, which was very broad,
deep, and rapid ; and, on the opposite bank, Porus ap-
peared ready to dispute thle passage, at the head of a for.
midable army, with a number of elephants ranged in its
front. But the danger ofpaffig the river was what ter-.
rified the Macedonians the most ; for they could nowhere
find a ford. Alexander had previously caused a great
numb~er of boats to be so confiruffed that they could be
taken to pieces, aud. by that means be easily transported
from place to place. As the river was full of islands,
thre yopngeft· and moRt vigorous of the Macedonians
threw thems~elves into the water with no other arms than
their. javelins, and fwnimazing to one of those islands in
which the enemy had made a lodgement, attacked and
killed a great number of them. But a fresh reinforce-

ment

eint arrivingf to the afifitance of the Indians, ,they ad-

Banced agaiinft thre Macedonians, overwhelmed them with
thb;ir darts, and obliged them to swi~m back again to the
self iof their -army. Porus, who beheld this ikirmith,
weas much elated with its fuccers.

.Alexrander, anxrious to cross the river, had recours~e to'
a firatagem to .effeal his purpose. Hie gave orders to
make a buffle and noise in several differenrt places, as, if
hh had a mind there to attempt a paffaglre.' By thdfe
'menans he diffra~ted the attention of ·Porus, who imme-.
diately hurried towards those places. Alexander, in the
mean time, after committing- the charge of the camp to
Craterus, with part of the: troops, to impress the enemy
with a belief that the whole army still continued in its
former position, niarched away with the refit, and passed,
uindifcovered, in boats, into a fmnall island overgrown
with wood. A violent R~orm of rain and thunder co-
ming on, capable of discouraging any any other person
than Alexander, favoured his passage. W~hile pafirng
the river in a boat, he is said to have let drop thiee
firiking~ exprefiions= : O, Athenians I could you be-
** lieve that I would willingly expose myself to so great
i dangers in order to attraat your comnmen~dations ?"
While Pomus kept a firiat eye on Craterus, ~who, by

his mot-ions, seemed determined to attempt the pathage,
Alexander reached the farther fide without molestation-,
and immediately drawing up his army in battle order,
though it consisted of no more than sooo men and Some
hiorfe, made the proper dispositions for fighting.

Porus hearing that Alexanderr had made good his pat-'

sage, detached against: him a considerable party of ca-
valry under the command of one of his f'ons. But A-
lexander attacking this detachment with great vigour,
cut off the greatest part of them, and killed their com-
mrander. Po~rus, informed of the death of his son, arl&
of the defeat of the troops under his ~command, advan-
·ced againlt Alexgandier with his w~hole army, confiltingg
of3 0,ooo0 foot, 4ooo horse, 300 chariots, and 2oo ele-
h~rants, which he drew up in battle order, with the ele.

phanta

phants in the front. Alexander made various evolutions
with his cavalry, to protraft the time till the reft of his
infantry tihould arrive. Then, initead of attacking the
mlain body of the enemy, he dispatched Iooo archers
to assail the cavalry on their left wing in front; ordered
Caenus to make a frudden evolution, and to attackr the
famEn cavalry in the rear, and he himself chatged them
·in flank.

The Indians, thus harassed on all sides, gave ground,

and retreated towards their elephants. In the mean
time, the Macedonian infantry having formed themselves
into their phalanx, advanced against those dreadful ani-
mrals, and assailed them with their spears. The elephants,
rendered furious by their wounds, brokse through the
abickeft: of the IMac~edonian battalions. But A~lexander,
after throwing the enemy's left wing into. confusion, u.
nited his cavalry, wvhic~h was superior to that of the ene-
mny, into one body, and carried terror and disorder
throughout. The elephants, now deprived of their con.
daf~tors, ran abbotp at random, and overthrew every
t~hing that came in their way. At lfaft the M~acedonian
infantry formed again, made a vigorous effort, compele
ted th~e-diforder among the Indian cavalry, and cut most
of them in pieces. Craterus having by this time passed
the river with the reft of the army, fell upon those who

were retreating, and made a great slaughter.

3 27. The Indians loft, in this battle, l0,oso foot;

and mnof of their elephants were either killed or

taken. Alexrander loft no more than aI 2 men.

Pomus, after behaving with s~urprising bravery, and

being wounded in the thoulder, was obliged at last,
wher. he~ saw his armiy rotally defeated, to retreat on has
elephant. Alexanrder, defircus to save him, sent Taxx-
lus to perfixade him to surrender. But Porus, inficadof
listening to his perfuations, cried out, on feeing him ap-
preach, a Is not that T~axilus, the traitor to his futyedis
ccand his native country !", Other officers,, therefore,
being ·dispatched to P~orus with the fame intention, at
qait, with much dific~ulty, prevailed upon hun to con-

Ilxander, itruck with admiration at his magnani~mItyk
left him in pof~ifeffion of his kingdom, and behaved to
hitn with the highest marks of honour and eaeem. A-
lexander ordered a city to be built on the field of battle,
and called i~t Nidcea.

A··dvancing still further into the Indies, he s~ubdued
manyy nations. Alex~ander now seemed to regard him.~
self as commitionedd by the gods to enilave _the univerfieL
and to exterminate those who thould presume to oppos~e
hi~s power. ZMarching againt the Catheans, a valiant
peop~le, who had united for: the defence of their common
libert'y, he defeated them in a great battle near a city
called Pazngala, which he nexpt took and destroyed. It
wras th·ere that he fo~und the BE~rachmans, whio wsere bot'h
the 'philofophers and likewise the ministers of religion
in India, and were very highly reverenced and effeemed
by 'their countrymen. There Brachmans led a most au-
fiere life : They drank nothing but water, futbfifed on
herbs and roots, spent much of their time in singin~g
hymnns to the gods, faited often, continued all their lives
ma thate of celibacy, and when oppressed by decripsi-
trsdi4 or the infirmities of old age,. voluntarily and
chtterfu~lly burnt themselves to death. C-icero re-
lates ·se~veral initances of their aftonithing patience,
They believed, that the world has had a beginning, and
that it thall have an end. They entertained the faime
opinioni as Plato with refped to the immortality of the
foul; but they adopted the doarine of the metempfy-

''When there philosophers saw Alexander, theyfltamnped

ing. TIheir chief, to give Alexander a more lively idea
of the slate of a great em~pire, ha~ving laid on the ground
a large dry ox's hide, puciffd with his foot each of its
corners, one after another ; and desired the king to;re-
mark, that, on his doing so, the other parts of the hide
irefie up; but at last placing his foot in the middle, he
Icept the whole level. By this he meant to insinuate,
that a king ought to reside in the centre of his domini.
ons, so as to be able to prevent all r~evolts and disorders
in the remotest quarters of it ; a~nd that he ou'ght never
to undertake~ fach difiant exrpeditions; as that which tA-
lexander was then prosecuting.

The Macedonians perceiving, in the mean tinie, that

Ale-xander, whole intepntion was fuill to push forwardi,
was taking meas~ures for passing the river Hyphafus,
could no longer conceal their dis~content. They com-
plained loudly, that their king s~eemed determined to set
no bounds to his expeditions ; that he was itill: advan-
cing farther and farther from their native country; and
that he feemced quite u~nconcerned at the exrceffive dan·
g~ers and fatigues to which he was continually expoling
his troops. Alexander hearing of this edmmotion, al-
Femnbled the. whole aimy, and mad~e a long [peech,
wherein he laboured to persuade them to pass the Hy-
phalus; telling them, that to retreat at present, would
aPPear a- disgraceful flight; that all his hopes were pla-
ced on their courage and resolution ; that, by their aSI
Exitance, he affered hi~mself of success in all his enteri
prifes; and he begged of them not to fruftwate his glo-

AtitloUS

sas exrpe~tations, of rivalling the exploits of ~Hercules
and of Bacchus. Perceiving however, that his, argn-
mlents produced no effe~a on his soldiers, who held down
their heads in mournful silence, he exclaimed, "C Wh~fat!
c*, not one of you answer me ? Then I am abandoned,
rrbetrayed, delivered over to my enemies. Be it so,
ra then; but still I will pass this river, thould not a
cr ·liingle man of you accompany me. The Scythians,
rC the Badtrians, more fai~thful than you, will follow me

cf na~tive country, base betrayers of your king, an~d
y;· oast of having .deserted him amuidft barbarous
"( and hoffile nations. As for me, I thall either ~Findl
rE here the viatory of which you despair, or a glorious
1L delrath."

Ina spite of this pathetic address, both o~fficers and fol-

dliers perfiifed in their silence. At length their grief
buritt forth in sighs and tears, infamuch that Alexander
himfbelf could not refrain fromt weeping. Then Ceauas
advancingf forward to the throne, and taking off his hel-
m~et pled the cause of the army. H~e affiured Alexan-
dlez;, that the affeation entertained for him by his soldiers
wras nowise dimninifhed;, that they were ready to march
whiitherfoever he defined to lead them; but he begged
him to listen to their refpeeaful representations. "S We
"L' have performed every thing for you," continued he,
"( that~ it is in the power of men to, perform: W7e have

ca9ppanied~ byI the groans and· tears of the whole army,
w~hoi cailele Alexander their lord, and fat~her. TThe offi*

cers

cers next addreifed him to the fame ·purpos~e. Still,
however, he remained infelexible, and thart hirnfelf up a-
kmne in his tent. But finding the foldirers obstinate in
their refblution, he at last iflized orders for their prepa-
ring to return. This news spread inconceivable joy
through the troops; and the· camp refounded with the
praises of the king.

Beforle setting out, ~Alexander caused twelve

Se6. altars ofan extraordinary height to be erefted; a

damp of far greater dimentions than the one he

really occutpied, to be marked out; and a bed, feren
feet and a half in length, to be made in each tent. By
these extravagant o~perations, he intended to' impress
posterity with a belief, that he and his men exceeded in
stature all the reft of the human race. The necessary
preparations b'eing made, the army imbarked aboard a
4tect of 8oo veffells; and proceeded to the conflux of the
+3ySdafpes and Acefinus.

After furffering greatly from the violence of those ri-

rers, Alexander· entered the country of the Oxydraca:
and Mall~ians, two warlike nations. H~aving defeated
them in fievieral enga~gene-nts, he marched against the
capital of the Oxydracae, and besieged it. Here he
was the first man that mounted the wall; his men ba-
fien to suppo~rt him; but the ladders break, and he is
left alone. To avoid the darts: hur~led at him from all
quarters, he jumps into the city: amnidft the enemy.
Here he ran the greatest danger he was ever expofedi

to e places his back to the trunk of a large tree,

wrards off with his thield the darts aim-ed at him, and
with his sword keeps the nearest of the enemy at bay:
At last he is deeply wounded with an arrow, and his
arms fall from his hands. An indian bielieving him
dead, approaches to firip him of his armour. Alex-
atxder recovers hims~elf, and plunges .a dagger into the
Inia-i~n's body. His principal ofi~cers arriving in the
mean time, performed prodigies of valour to save their
king, and faitained all t~he effots of the enemy till the
reft of the army forced the gates, and rushing In put

r11 they meet to the Iword. TZhen Alexanider was darried
-if~Fto his tent'; but as the thirgeols werle obliged to ert-
1Jarge the wound before they could extrai~t the arrouw,
he fainted under the operation, and his men Im~agine~d
·hi~m dead. I~t ivras several days bieford he recovered of
this wound. As soon as he wcas able to go abroad, he
pirefented himself to his foldiersj- to dispel their appre-
henflons.

In the mean time, deputies arrivted from the Oxye

:dirnse and M-allians, bringing him presents, promising
to pay him tribute, and offering to deliver him hioftages.
Gklexander accepted of those tokens of fubmillion, and
appeared weHl pleased with. the embas~sy. Graterns
s;ei~zing this favourable moment, represented to him the
terror -into which his late danger had thrown ther army;
:intreated him to ·be more careful of so precious a life
Ifor the future, and ·to reserve his bravery for some-
e-ccafion worthy of it. We thudder with horror, added
he, at the very idea of the extreme danger to which you
.exposed your- imnportant life in a dispute for so paltry
:a.place. Alexander, delighted with this' fiong mark
,of the affeftion of his officers, embraced them one after
anotther, and made them an excellent fipeech, in which
hbe dificovered all his grearnefs -of foul. H-e as~sured
-them, that he entertained the most grateful sense of the
repeated marks of affeationn they had shown him :
"L But," continued he, "L you and I think of this mat-
"ter very differently : you desire to enjoy my faciety
'" for a long while ; but I do not eff imate life by the
·p length of its duration, but by the opportunities it

"'tories, and not by my years, I may be said to have
"Clived long already. But were it not unbecoming

$arbacae; who, though a pow~erful nation, were ftruckt
wi~th te~rr~or .at his arrival, and inarediately made him

vTed at Ptatata, wthere he canfed. a titad-el and 'harbour to
b2e built. In this place the river bndus divides itlelf, into
twn~o larg~ branhes,. $eized wilpth -a desire to fee the
ocean, he ·embarked his whole amy at this pliace upon
the right-hSa~nd branch Of the river. When he approach.
e~d ·the ocean, his heart exulted with joy, and he affIared
his folbdi~ers, ·that they were now at the. end of their
lJabolurs, and that their exploits. had reached to the
farthest bounds of nature. His Sect, in the mean thee,
was exspofe~d to goreat danger by the ebbinag and flow-
ing of the ocean. Ignorant of the cause. of this pheno.
nuenon, botrh offticers and foldliers were throw~~n into the
gre-atest comiterslation. . Alexander, however, still pro-
Eceded ·for ward with part of the fleet, to get a view of
the vast extent of sea that was before him ; and arriving
at the ocean alt la3E, he pe~rformed a solemn sacrifice to
Neptune. After having thus, as he imagined, pushed
·his conquests to the iremnoreft corners of the earth, he re-
turned to join the reft of his army in the neighbourhood
of P~atala.

HLe then seriously gave orders for making the necef-

fary preparations for his return. , He embarked the best
of his trroos on5 board ·of his fleet, of which he gave
Nearchus the command; and with the reft he ·himself
set out for Babylon by land. Nearchus being obliged
to Iwait till the s~eason became favourable did: not leav~e

nia, he received grievous complamnts agamRi several of
his governors of provinces; who, concluding that he
never would return to call them to an account for their
conduat, had ex;ercised every fort oif tyranny and rapine
during blis absence. Alexander thinking it proper, by
a speedy execution of juffice, to ensure the affeations o~f
the conquered provinces, caused to be put to death all
the governors convidted of oppression, together with
those -who had sated as the ministers of their violence.

AClexande~r arriving at Pafagarda, a city of Persia,

was met by O~rfinus, the ~governor of that country, a
man poifeiffed of immlenfe riches, who brought to the
king a great number of magnificent presents, among
which were many fine horkes, chariots adorned with
gold, several· precious pieces of furniture, golden vales,
and 4000 talents of silver. Besides these presents to the
king,~ Orfinus beltowed marks of his bounty on all the
principal officers of Alexander, except the eunuch Ba-
·goas, that prince's chief ~favourite, for whom he enter-
tained a thorough contempt. Servants employed about
princes as the infiruments of their vilest paffons, are
always endued with fouls as sordid as their Rtations, and
are capable of sacrificing to their bas~e refemtments the
noft: sacred conside~rations. This infamous eunuch
emitted no rnearis to ruin Orfinus in the opinion of the
king, and was perpetually accefing him of treason and
of rapine. Not satisfied with employing calumny for
this villanous purpos~e, he suborned some of Orfinus's
retainers to become at a proper s~eason the accusers of-
their mailer. ·After having by there means initilled into the

the mind of Alexander fulpicions against his fubjeft, and-
iby that means haviing artfully disposed him to give cre-
;dit to .the grossest accusations againit him, he at last got
jlhs accused to the king, of having plundered the tomb
ofCyrus, within which Alexander, in place of the im-
i~nenfe riches he-was made to ex~pelt, found nothmng but
& thield and fame arms. The magi, who were entruit-
ed. with the care of the tomb, were put to the torture
in vain. Bagoas at last: pr-evailed with the followers of
\Orfritus, whom he had corrupted, to accute their ma-
Siter of having stolen those treasures; and Orfinus was
thereupon seized and put to death, without being al-
Iowed to make any defence. A firiking example to
princes of the danger of fuffering themselves to be too
eaf~iy prepoffeffed .against any of their fubje~ts or de-
pendents by the insidious arts of their favouritres.
··While Alexander re nained at Pafagarda, the brach.
man ·Calanus, who had accompanied that prince in many
ors his' expeditions, having been attacked by a violent fit
of the cholic, r'efolved to put an end to his days; and,
bjrthe most earnest intreaties, at last obtained permiion
.tc~ ·caufLe a funeral pile to be ere~ted, upon which he
might burn himself. After offering up his prayers to
the gods, and performing the other ceremonies pradi-
fed in his native country, he embraced his friends, beg.
giid of them to spend the dayr in feaiting and making
merry with Alexsander, mounted the funeral pdle, co-
v~red his face, and fufferedl himself to ·be burnt i;Nith all
the marks of cheerfulness and fatisfadi~aon. Alexander,
in osnpliance with the request of Calanus, assembled
his friends, and having proposed a prize to him who
thduld drink the most, the whole company indulged
themselves in to great an excess of wine, that forty-one
ofthem died of it. 'What: a menfirous feene * !

followed the exrample, and married the claughters of
the noblest Pertians. Alexander gave a grand enter-
tainment to all the new married, at which 9000 guests
are said to hiave been present. The king, on this occa.
f ion, resolved to discharge all- the debts of his soldiers *
a generosity worthy of Alexrander, for they amounted
to I o,ooo talents. 14e did not even desire them to fpe-
cify the particular debts that each of them owed. As
the soldiers seemed, at firit, to doubt the sincerity of
his intentions, he expressed to them that excellent senti.
rnent·, "C That a king ought never to break his word with
"C his f~ubjeats, nor ought furbje61s ever to futpeCft the fin-
*Ccerity of their fovereign's profeifions."
'While Alexander continued at Susa, he was joined

by 3·,aooo young Persians, destined to fopply the place
of the old decayed soldiers. They were all firong and
well made, and were armed and disciplined after the
IVacedonian manner. 'They paiffed in review ~before the
king, who was delighted to fee the fine appearance of
thus new army.

Harpalus, whom Alexrander had left governor of Ba-

bylon, had diflipated, in the most extr~avagant manner,
the immense riches that had been committed to his care,
indulging himself in all kinds of debauchery, on the
fuippofition that Alexander never would return to call
him to an account. But getting notice at last of his
arrival, and of the severity with which he had treated
the other governors who had been guilty of malverf~a-
tions in their duty, he quitted the service of Alexander,
and taking with him 5000 talents, the remains of his
former wealth, retired to Athens. On his arrival there,
the mercenary orators immediately offered him their
bel -services. Harpalus, finding that Phocion poffeffed
great credit with the people, offered him a present of

his eytes witz a~nother vi~iew of the ocean, descen~ded to it
by thfe river Ele~a and. after coasting· aleag the Peir~a

Macedonia, and that h~e desired to free his hands ake.~

thought, they harried in. a tumultuous mannjer to find

lon·ger~ valued ~his M~acedonianrP soldiers, he~ w~ould dif-
charge them-all, for they were resolved to se~rve him no

'F f 4 longer

aoger. This ~e~ditious addres~s threw Alexander into so

violent a pallion, that he ordered thirteen of the ring.
leaders to be instantly feizerd and pkut to death. This
uintance of authority to terrified the reft, that they durst
not look up nor utter a syllable. Then Alexander,
mounting his tribunal, reproached them, in very severe
terms, with the many markrs of kindness he had beffow.
ed on them-; and concluded with there words: "c You
F;' require your discharge; I grant it; depart, and pub-
" lifh to the world, that you havre abandoned your king
** to the mercy of the nations he has conquered, who
c' have ihown greater attachment to him than you."-3
}Iavin~g spoken thus, he retired to his tent.

The Macedonians, now sensible of their folly, burit

out ·into sighs and lamentations, haftcn to the tent of the
kin-g, throw down their arms, and contefs their fault
with tears. Alexander, feeing them in this situation,
could not himself refrain from weeping. Coming out:
of his tent, therefore, he told themn, that he reffored to
them his friendship. Then he discharged all who were
unable longer to bear arms; made each of them large
prefeats, and gave orders, that the foremost feats at all
p~ublicgames thouldl be reserved for them. Craterus
was appolinted to condu£L~them home; and, at the fame
time, he was created governor of Macedonia in place of
Antipat~er ; whom Alexander, in compliance with the
earnest request of his mother, who was continually tea-
sing him with accufgations against that officer, desired
to have near his own pers~on.

Thence proceeding to Echatana in Media, he cele-

brated numuberlefs games and feasts, at which the whole
court gave themselves up to the -mast extravagant ex.
cef fes of drinking. There debauches proved fatal to E-

pheftion, the most intimate friend of Alexander,

g 24.and whom he ofed to~ call another self. As E-

pheftion was miodeft ·and benzevolent, and em*

played his influence with great dificretion, his death was
univrerfally regretted. Even Alexander himflElf, forget-
ting his dignity, gave way to the most- tender feelings o~f~

o·f fiendfihip, and appeared quite inconsolable. To di-
perft his~grief, he unldertook an expedition against the
coffeians, a ;warlikre nation; and having conquered
them, he f'et out for Babylon.

Before he arrived at that city, the affrologers and

Chaldean soothsayers sent him word, that great dan-·
ger threatened his life in cafe he entered Babylon. This
denunciation alarmed Alexander- very much at firit. But
the G3reek philosophers having, on the principles of A-
naxagoras, demonfirated to hire the folly of· affrology,
he immediately advanced towards Babylon with his
whole army. But he had (till another motive for ha-
fiening towards that city, namely, that he might there'
receive the homagfe of many ambathddors, who had
come thither for that purpose, from differeni kringdomns
of the world. Alexander, therefore, madr his entry
into Babylon with the utrnoft pomp imnaginable. H-e
received, with equal dignity and complais~ance, the con-e
'gratelations of all the ambassadors, but particularly of
thos~e from the Rtates of Greece. Upon the deputies
from Corinth making him an offer of the freedom of
their city, he could not help fmniling at the singularity
of such an'offkir to so mighry a prince. But on being
informed, that this privilege had never been before be-
flowed on any firanger but Hercules alone, he imme-
diately received it with joy. T'hen he applied all his
attention to celebrate the funerals ·of Ephefition ; which
were attended with foch pomp and magrulicence, as to
surpass every thing ·of the fame kind that had ever ap-
peared in -the world before. He gor together the moit
·ikilful architeas from all quarters, and beltowed great
.pains on levelling the [pot whercon the pile was to be
placed.
: The edifice formed a square conrifting of thirty divi-
rions s in each of which was ereated a similar building
to that in the reft, covered and emnbellifhed with extra-
ordinary magnificence. Along the front were disposed
240 prOWS of thips; on which were placed figures of
girchrers and warriors fix and a half test high : The [jpa.

cos

ces~ between the prows were hung with purpl~e ftuffs :
Adbove~ the- prows was a range of torches twen-ty-four
feet high, forming a for t of olonade, adorned with
fifty-three crowns of gold: TEhe capitals of this colonlade
~cnfi~ed of figures in the tha-pe of eagles :, Above this
colonade stood another, representing a hunting-match:=
Above this. appeared a fourth, exhibiting the battle of
th~e Cent~aurs·: The roof of the edifirce wkas. deortated
writhr trophies and urns; and on the entablatures were
placed fsg~ures reprefeming· Syrien~s, within which were
concealed ed-~icians, who: sung mournful airs in honou~r
of the deceased. This edifice was upwards of son feet
high; and the whoLe expence of the funeral amounted
to arbout x,,5oo,~ooo Steriin~g #.

Wi77hat folly, thus to· confurne in empty sh~ow such an

immense Tum, produced by the toil and labour of the
mast ofeful falbjeas. But not fatBisfied with all there
mart·1ks of honour paid to the memory of his beloved E-
pheffion, Alexander resolved to offer sacrific~es to him as.
a god, and that under the authority of a respo-nse of the
or-acle· of Jupiter Amernaon; to obtain which a proper
person was dispatc~hed with the ne;effary infkrudions.--
He~ himfelrfT fr the exa~mple,; after wvhich, in order to
pl~ease ~the· prince,-nu~mberlefs~ temples were every where
cremed to Ephletion,~ and. it was r~eckon.~ed cri minal even
to den~bt of his being a god.

As Babylon was the g~reatest and the molt beautiful

city of the east, Alexander refolvped to beantify it ti~ll
more, and to make it the feat of his empire. In the
first place, therefore, he ,gave orders to repair the but-
war-k formerly confrudted to· cornfine the Euphrates to
its channel, but wh~ich that river had in a: great meafaure
demolished. This ofeful projeat, however, as wael~l as
that of rebuilding the temple of Belns, which, had been

ruined

* The principal architeC&f of the·. mrenamen erefed by3 Alexan*

rozooo inhabitants.

ruined by fZXerxes, as the idol worflhippe~d in it had been
by Cyrus, together with alt his· other projec~s, were ptits
;1 ·ilop to by his death.

The melancholy idea of approaching dissolution had

now laid fast hold on the imagination of Alexander. El
very· acdcident firuck him with terror,. and carri~ed an e-
vil priefage along with it. He beecame a downright slave
·to superstition, and was perpetually offring up facri-
fices to render fate propitious, and to obtain the know-
lidge of futurity. To divert the constant Itings of ap.
prehension, he employed his time in an uninterrupted
course of fealting and drinking, particularly the latter,
in~ which he indulged himself to foch .e-xcers, that he
thereby greatly accelerated his death. After having,
at one of there feasts, already drunk to great excefs,.he
resolved, nevertheless, to empty the cup of H;ercul·es,
which contained fix bottles. But he had no sooner
swall~owed it: than he fell to the ground, and was seized
with a violent fever, which quickly reduced him to the
point of death. Finding that thei-e was no hope of re-
cxovery left, he delivtered his ring to Perdiccas., and perl
anitted all his soldiers to ksifs his hand. On being aik-
ed to whom he left his empire ? ** %O the: mpaf oworthcy,"
answered he. He added, that he fore~saw wi~th what
ithange rites they would celebrate his funeral. Perdic-
cas hav~ing alk~ed him, how soon he desired they thould
pa~y divine: honours to his memory~ ? e answered,
'* W~hen you thall~ be happy." Ther~e were his ~lat
words.l-He died at the age of thirty-two, afteer reigning
twtelve yrears.

Some authors, an-d Qcuintus Curtius among the

reft, p~retended that be died by poifoo. But: this ga g.
opinion is by no means .properly supported; and
it is ~far more probable that he .diedi of exellive drink*~
snrg. As soon as his death was- knows, nothing was heard
but weeping and lamentation. The vitters and the v~an-
quilbed equally bewailedl his death. TIhe PedianRs ex-I
tailed him as the mildeit and the jufteft of their mo-

narchs

trddrchs; the Macedonians proclaimed him to have been
the best and the bravest prince in the world. The grief
of the latter was heightened by their pref~ert melancholy
th~uation beyond the Euphrates, and mn the midit of
their enemies. They foresaw, too, the wars and dzvi-
Sons that must unavoidably arise from his having na-
medd no fuceffor. Syfigambis mourned his death as
Pfmeerely as the had done that of her own son; and fitnd.
ing herself, by this event, withourt furrth~er refourrce or.
hope, the gave way to the fuggeltions of delpair, and
starved hersel2f to death.

The offlicers, after diiputing for seven days, at last at-

greed, that Aridens, th~e brother of Ale~xander, thould
be declared king ; and that his person (for he was a
poor weak manr) tholdO1EE be intruited to the care of Per-
diccas. -The body of Plexeander, -after being embalm-
ed! by the Chaldeans, was, accordinrg to his own direc-
tions, conveyed to the temple of Jupiter Ammon. But
two years intervened before the necessary preparations
could be gotten ready.

Alextander's· charaaer is marked by numberless b~le-

mithes. On due c~onsideration, however, it may per-
baps appear to fame readers, that his "great and good
quaitiies- predominated over his vicious and: bad.

He was born with the finest natural parts; and his

magnanimity -and· lofty Fentimoents were aolmoit without
ex3ample.--~He early discovered. marks of the greatest
generosity; but he as early gave proofs of an unequal-
led ambition. He received a perfea education under
the most skilful of matters, Ariatotle, who took great:
pains to cultivate his genius ; and he inifru~ed him not
onliy in the fine arts, but in the most fubime sciences.
The fcholar's progr-ess corresponded with the zeal and
;;k~ill- of his ·inftru~tor.

While young, he discovered very singular prudence,

and. found means, during the absence of his father, to
pacify femie dangerous conmmotionsa that had broken out
in Mlacedonia. At the age of twenty years, he fabdued
ihis most formida~ble enemnies, namely, all the Rtates of

G~reece

Greece combined against him. In the opinion indeed
of some, the first years of his reign were the most glo.k
rions of his life. He furpported the fame charadter in his
expedition against Darius 4 which was not undertakren
with a youthful raihnefs, but with all the vast prepara-
tions that the greatness of the ernterprife r~equired;
m~agnanimity, prudence, temperance,· courage.

To judge how far he poff~effed every talent of a com-

plete general, it is only neceflfary to,contemplate his pas-
'fage of the Granicus, his battles at Issus and Arbela, and
his siege of Tyre. WCe thall there perceive his Ikill at
drawing up an army in battle order, his presence of
axind in the heat of adtion, his intrepidity in the nsida
of danger, and his firmness and constancy under diiap-
pointments. His father Philip fludied to subdue his
enemies by firatagem and circumvention. AFlexrander
pradtited open force and bravery alone. H-is~behaviour~,
after the battle of Iflis, is perhaps the aation of his
wrihole life that did him the most: honour ; for, on that
occasion, he gained a more difficult viatory over h'is
own pailions than that over the Persian monarch.

His conduat to the wife and daughters of Darius, who

found in his very camp an as~ylum for their honour and
virtue, places him in a most amiable point ofsview, and
'befp~eaks him truly great. It likewise does honour to
Aliexander, that he was fafceptibl~e of the moit tender
and conitant fr~iendship: a charadter which he invarin-
~ably maintained to the last period of his life; and he
_was rewarded, by finding several sincere and real friends,
a happiness rarely incident to persons of high rank.
His familiarity with, and his kindefs to, his soldiers, con-
vrinced them that they were beloved by their king'; and
gratitude for that hon'our, prompted them -to exert their
atmoft efforts to please~ him, and to obey his commands
with the highest ardour. Nothing was wanting to ren-
der the glory of Alexander complete, had be known
h~ow to set proper bounds to his ambition. But, infa-
tuated by an uninterrupted- and dazzling course of pr~o.

fperacy,

[perity, he soon bericame entirely diffe~rent from what he
had8 f~ormerly ben.

~Afer the faege of Tyre, we perceive the good qua.

lities of Aslexander to be daily degeneramng. O~n fee-
ing him ex~pose his own lif~e, and that of his troops, in a
journey th~rough the ·burning deser~ts of Libya, -wath the
absurd view of pr~ocuring hims~elf to be acknowledged the
fona of Jupitn~er mmocn, we are amazed at his folly and
imaprudence. Miie are dhocked to fee him give hitnfelf
uip inl. Ada to such immoderate excitfes of drinkring. By
this vice, ·equally dequicable an~d daingeresis, we fee hem
iniltigated to dip h~is ands in the bloodl of a fr~iend~ who
had fared his liife. We ·likew~ise fee his underfianding
to much affeaed3tr ~by is intemperance, that ·he is not a-
ihamed to vilify ithe glory of his father, and to underva-
Lue his a~2igcns. Tihis was equally rrai-glorio~us and tin-
candid. For· on. due ionaf-idertio we thall perceixve,
that Prhilip wars not only3 thee sol~e aithor oss bis ownr
powYier, butt likewoife of that of hi's son. Hre tra~nfimitted to
him ·th~e kEingd;om . of Mlacedonia enlarged ex~ceedingly
on all frdes ; he left him maste~r of Greece s and above
aR,~ he put into his hands a p~owerful army of veteran
soldiers, admirabljy difdi-plinzed~, and comm~a~n;ded by a

gret urmerof brave and experien8cd ·offiers. Nort

can it:be disputed itat Philip gave the most indubitable
proofs of :his abiity to effel5 th~e con~quefs cifedec
by his son; wlhie, onl the othier hnand, it is not to cleari
that A~lexande rcould8 have performe~d what his father
per~formed.

tion confined itself neither by rule nor m3nedaure. ~On

Eminent Wriitersr, Philosophers, ArtiJts, /.rc.

InHs third age of Greece produced a great number

of phmilofophers. At the head of all these Socrates de-
serves to be ranked ; but as we have already spoken of
him at great length, we shall fay no more of him here,
but ~pass on to others, and begin with

Pl1ato, a native of Athens, and the most famous ·dif-

cSiple of Socrates. Plato did not. confine himnfel~f, liike
his mattetr, to the fulbjeft of morals alone, but fludied
every branch of philosophy. His thirit a'ter knowledge
prompted him to travel into Egypt, where he learned
from the priests various branches of knowledge gene-

rally

·rally -unknown. His accurate notions about the exist·
ence of God, and the immortality of the foul, are genel
rally thought to have been communicated to him in that
country. We~ Ihall have occaflon afterwards to mention
his journeys to Syracuse at the request of the younger
Diony Gus. At last he 6 xed his coditant residence at

Bth~ens, where he delivered his lessons in the fine gari
den called the Academy. Hence his -disciples got the
nlame of' .dcademicia-ns.

Among his principal tenets may ·be reckoned the fold

lowing : TLhat there is but one world :-- That there is
but one God, the author of all things :--Tlhat the foul
.s Immortal:- That men ought to resist their pafflons :
T--hat after this life the good and virtuous ihall be
rewarded, and thE wicked and vicious punished. Plato
·dei~vered his doatrines in the ·form of dialogues. He
appears to have pof~ffeed a firong imagination, His flyle
is extremely flo'rid an~d sublime, and is particularly di-
aiteingrithedb a d-eli~cacy known to the Greeks by the

sname of Atticifin. His works abound with the most
lofty fentsments, and wpith the most ofeful maxtims for
the conduat of life, and for the science of government.
He derclined engaging in the affaiis- of the republic,
.preferring the calm unruffled life of a philosopher. H
was very highly efiteemed for the mildness of his manr-
ners; and wars so much admired on account of his vast
extent of kno wledg~e and his s~ublime fTentiments, that he
wpas honoured wi'th the name of the Divine Plato. Even

kings desired to be diredezd by his counsels.

3948. He died at eighty years of age. His nephew,

Speufippus, succeeded him in his school. But

his fcsholars, after his death, diftinguilhed themselves
into two sea~s ; the followers of the one taking the name
of Academincians, and continuing to teach in the fame
place wphere Plato had taught; and those of the other
that of ~enripatiticks, who walked and reasoned upnder
the thade of the plerafant groves of the Lyceucm; and
thience obtained. that appellation. Plato deserves like-
wife to be .ranked in the clas~s of rhetoricians, on account

of the excellent principles of rhetoric laid down ii his:
didligues, alnd especially in the Gorgras.

Ariflot~le was a natlive of Stagira, a city of Macedoniaa

Ie~E came to Aethens art the age of seventeen, and fluidied
philosophy under Plato with fouch inddiffry and fauccels,
diat he became the fool of his school. On the birth of
Alex~ander, Philip wrote him, that he intezided to -make
him-r preceptor to his son. "L I account," says Philip
in his letter, "r the favour of the gods greater in f~endi
cc ing rne this son during the life of Ariftoatle, than irl
**-beffowing him upon me at all."

After spending fevreral years on the education of A-

lIdxander, he returned to Athens, open-ed a school in
the Lyceute, and became the founder of the Peripate~
tic sea. His leaures drew together a vraft drowd of
hearerts. He carried to a wonderful degree of perfec.
tionr the art of dialeaic, whereof Zeno was the invientor.
jBut he did not confine himself to matters of philosophy.
11 gave lefirons on rhe'toricz and compiofed a treatis~e on
th~at Arbjea, which has been justly regarded by the
learned if all ages as the most accurate and complete
thart has ever appeared. It is on this accotmt that Ari-
ftotle, as well as his mcafter Plato,· is numbered ainong
the~ rhetoricians.

Ariffotle met with the fate of rioft great men. He

attrafted the envy of his cotemporaries, who accursed
hint of impiety;l and one Eurymedon appeared as his
prefectator. To dis~appoint the malice of his enemies,
anid to~ avoid the unhap~py fate of Socrates, he fled to
thle liland of Euboea, wher-e he ended his dlays. His
worisks, after remaining more than 200 years buried irt
obtlivio~n, during which time they had passe~d through
various private hands, had fnffered much by damp and
other accidents,. and had been greatly corrupted and
objfbured by ignorant tranferiber's, were at length disco-
vrered- by the famous Sylla at Athiens when he sacked
that city, and were by hilm brought to Italy. 1Vfhen gene-
tally known, they were justly adopted as the most per-
felt standard on every topic of which they treat~ed. The

G g fur-

s~urprising diversity of those fabjeas, the profound em~-
dition, the acutenefin, and the singular accuracy with
which every point is~ there handled, fufficiently evince
the comprehensive genius of the author. A course of
observations and experimnents, for many ages, has indeed
produced the dis~covery of various secrets of nature, of
which Ariffotle feemns to have been ignorant, and which
no force of genius evier could divine. But in every
matter of science, those who are the belt acquainted with
his philosophy, and with that of the most approved mo-
dern philosophers, are firuck with amaz~ement at his
vast: superiority·.

Xenocrates succeeded Speutippus in the school of

Plato. Being a man of a gloomy suffere difpolition,
Plato, whole scholar he was, used to advise him to facri-
fice to the Graces. His contempt of riches is much
talkied of. He carried it so far, as voluntarily to reduce
himself to poverty. Having been sent by the Athenians
in quality of deputy to negociate some matters with
Philip King of Macedon, that crafty prince attempted
to corrupt him by prefients, but found all his endeavours
ine~ffeaual. Alexander made the fame attempt with the
famne success. Xenocrates refused a present he offered
him of fifty talents ; but, apprehensive left that prince
might interpret h~is refus~al as ~an effeQ of pride, he ac-
cepted of thirty minee. The Aithenians entertained the
h~ighest opinion of his integrity; insomuch, that one
day, when he was to have given testimony about a cer-
tain affair, the judges dispensed with demanding his
oath, satisfying thems~elves with his fimaple affirmation.
He was to fond of solitude and fludy, that he seldom
appeared abroad. His leatures on virtue were attended
with amazingf es& Rt. They often reclaimed the Athe-
nian youth from every kind of debauchery.

Diogenes lived in the time of Alexander the Great,

and was of the fec' of the Cynics, founded by Antift.
henes, a disciple of Socrates. The philosophers of this
s~eQ lived a most rigid life : Wearing no other cloaths
than a cloak; and carrying about wfith them no other

con-

conveniences than a fort of knapsack, a ftaff, and a kind
of t wo-eared bowl of wood or metal. Diogenes diltin·
guiihed himself more than any other of this s~e~t by his
cynical behaviour; which he carried to such an extra.
vsagant pitch, as to become ridiculous. He w~alked b~are-
foot, and lodged in a tub. But under this beggarly
equipage, be entertained a more than kingly pride,
and a sovereign contempt for all mankind. The reader-
has already seen his anfwner to Alexander the Great.
He is celebrated for many witty sayings, and for some
excellent maxims of morality. But his condua evmn-
ced, that he was at no pains to praaife throfe precepts
hims~elf ; for never did man carry impudence mn pomnt
-of morals to a greater pitch. This impudence, his con-
temptuous airs, and his satirical remarks, were his dif-
tinguifhing charaateriftics. HZ~ence came th~e name of
Cynic, a Greek word derived from the name of dog, to
denote, thlat the philosophers of this cast took dehight mn
railing, or rather barking and snarling likre dogs, at the
reft of mankind.

~Zeno was the foundier of the feEL of Stoics. He was

originally a disciple of Crates, a cynical philosopher.
But difguffed at the impudence of that fitB, he attached
himself to lenocrates and Polemon, and eltablifhed a
newr fe~ at Athens, namely that of the Stoics, as already
obl'rved. T'his s~ea derived its name froni a gallery in
which they taught, called in Greek Stoa. Zeno soon
ac~quired great reputation. He was muchi eileemed
by the Athenians for the purity of his precepts, which
he himself praailed with the greatest exaanefs ; and
for the zeal with which he inculcated the principles of
virtueL

Cleanthus, Chryfippus, and PofiTdonius, were fcho-

lars of Zeno. They all valued themselves on their per-
se~t contempt of riches. Zeno was the inventor of dia-
le~tic, the art that teaches us to deduce certain conclu-
fions from certain principles. The Stoics piqued them-
selves much on their excelling in this art ; but their rea-
foning often degenerated i to fophillical arguments.h

The Stoics maintained, that the forereign good con-

rifted in living virtuously according to the didtates of
confrcience. In other words, they placed all happiness
in the praaice of virtue.--Their chief aim was to ren-
der themselves insensible to the miseries incident to hu-
snan life. For that purpole they laboured to convince
themnfelves, that "e every thinag that hatppens is for- the
"' befl;" and thence argued, that our diftin~tions be,
tween good and evil are merely chimerical.--A perfedt
Stoic, therefore, did not ·regard even pain as an evil.
Their philosophy was calculated to render them entirely
devoid of passion and of frailty. But it thould seem,
that, to reform nature, they meant to exrtingu~ih it alto.
gether ; for they must have known that pai~ion is con-
ftitutionally inherent in man. It must, however, be al-
lowed, that the Stoics were, of all the ancient phl~ofo-
phers, the most virtuous both in point of principles and
of pradice, and that some of the greatest and wifeit men
of antiquity were formed in their school.

The Peripatetics entertained nearly the fame opinion

with the Stoics as to the chief good ; but they effeemed
riches and health to be good, and poverty and disease
to ~be evil.

Epicuctru was founder of the Epicurean f~e~ of philo.

fophers. He was a native of a vilh~ige in Attica, and
opened his school in a delightful garden at Athens,
where he was attended by a vast concourse of hearers, and
arrived at a distinguished reputation. None of his ma-
my· works having been transmitted to us, it is from the
poembof Lucretius that we learn the system of his phi-
lofophy. Lucretius mlay be ranked at the head of those
poets, who would have been happier to have been born
without genius, than to have perverted their talents to
subvert religion and found reasoning.

Epicurus maintained, that pleas~ure was the sovereign

gSood. By pleasure, according to Cicero, he meant the
pleasures of fed~e, such as the contemplation of beautiful
objecas; eating and drinking; thows and divedfians.
Cicero thinks, that he did not believe in the exist~ence o~f

of gods, although he spoke in very pompous terms of
the refpeat to be paid them. He maintained, that the so-
vereign evil codifiied in pain ; to which, although his
sage was liable, yet he said,S that he found sources of
happines~s even in pain it'ielf. On the other hand, in
point of the moral duties of man, he delivered very ad-
mirablb precepts, and extremely opposite to those we
thould expe&t from a -philosopher who placed the fore-
reign good in pleafore. But the most extraordinary cir-
cumitance of all is, that he lived a pure and irreproach-
able life.

-Pyrrho,' a philosopher of the f~ee of Sceptics, was a

native of Elis in the Peloponnese, and lived in the time
of Alexander. He maintained, that, with refpeat to
the qualities of every fubjeat about which the human
mind is conversant, there is ground for affimation and
denial; that therefore, there can be no certainty ; anid
we mus~t of course never form a politive decided judge-
m1ent of any thing. Hence this doatrine has obtained
the name of Pyrrhom'Fm. From those principles he de-
duced the most pernicious consequences ; that nothing
was in itself honourable, thamneful, just, or unjult; these
diftinaions depending entirely on human initiaotion.
This was opening a door to every fort of crime. It
would therefore have been for the honour and happines~s
of mankind, that there opinions had gone out of the
world with their author. But· foch is the depravity
ofthe human heart, that even in our days they find
abettors aind supporters among men of genius and
learning.

In this third age of Greece flourithed 2Menander the

poet, who is regarded as the fath~er of polite comedy.
He was perfeetly free from the faults of Ariffophanes,
who refpe~ted neither decency nor modesty·, nor even
the gods themselves ; and who gratified the malevolence
of his audience by scurrilous refleaions against the best
men in the Rtate. In the judgment of Quintilian, Me-
nander outshone all those who had applied to comedy
before him; his humour being exquisite, graceful, and

G g de.

delicate. From a despair, no doubt, of equalling him,
Terence, who applied to the fame study, satisfied him-
self with translating, in a manner, the productions of
~Menander, and with presenting them to the Roman
people, set off with all the graces and purity of the
Latin tongue.

Protoge~nEEf, the famous painter, flourished in the time

of A'rifforle, with whom he was conneated by the moRt
intimate friendship. He was a native of Cauna, a city
on the fea-coait of Rhodes. His excellency in his pro-
fTefiTon induced the Athenians to employ him in several
pieces of work, which after wards attra~ted universal
admiration. His masterpiece was his Jalif~us the son of
Apollo, and a great hunter.

Praxiteles, the celebrated statuary, likewise lived in

this age. He wrought principally on marble. His ma-
fierpiece was a statue of cupid, which he gave as a pre·
sent to the courtesan Phryne, of whom he was very
fond. She set it up at Thel~pla her native country, whi-
ther numbers of the curious repaired to view it *.

Polycl~etes, another statua~ry, and a native of Sicyon,

was famous for his statues of brass. His masterpiece
was· a Doriphorus, the name of those who served in the
Persian king's guards. This ftatune was to much admi-
red for the extraordinary jufI~nef~s of its proportions, that
it was called the Cacnon or Rule, and as furch was catrec
fully fludied by faucceeding s~culptors. APpeller,

* This is f'uppofed to be thle antique mentioned in .De 'Thou'rs ~e-·

moirs. He t~ells, that: having gone' to Italy, when young, with
De F;oix, they saw at Pavia, in the calleftion of Is~abella D)'Efii, a
statue of a sleeping CZupid executed by M. Angelo r which, after the
nioft attentive consideration, appeared supremely excellent, and fal-
led them with inexpressible admiration. After admiding it for forne
time, another statue of a cupid was ihown them, still foiled with the
earth out of which it had been digged. On comnparing this with
the former, all present were afhamned of their first judgment, and a-
greed, that the ancient flatue seemed to be an animated fubilance,
and that the m'odern, comp~ared with it, was but a block of mar ble;c
wihitqut; ezprC 108.,

Apell7es, the celebrated painter, was a native of the'

island of Cos, but resided for the most part at Ephesus.
He is placed at the head of all the ancient painters, and
is said to have contributed no less to the perfeaion of
painting by his writings on that fubjea, than by his ad.
mirable performances. The particular in which he prin.
cipally excelled, was the grace, or an eary noble air,
tempered with sweetness; but which is more easily felt
than expressed. He executed several portraits of Alex-
ander ; whereof that which represented him lanchmng
the thunder was the most highly finished. His engagmng
manners even procured him the friendship of the Mace-
donian hero, who did not disdain to visit him frequent-
ly, that he might fee him work, and enjoy the pleasure
of his conversation. Alexander pr-ohibited any other
person than Apelles from presuming to paint him. The
singular merit of Apelles exposed him to much envy,
and stirred up many enemies against him during his Rtay
at the court of Ptolemy 'King of Egypt, On returming
to Ephesus, he revenged himself upon his detraaors
by his famous piature of Calumny, which was reckoned
one of his capital performances. His Venus rising froxn
the sea was accounted his masterpiece.

Lyjippus, the famous statuary, likewise lived in the

time of Alexander. He was a native of Sicyon. H
said, that Polycletus's Doryphorus at first served him in-
ifead of a master : But having afterwards consulted the
painter Eupompus, which of the preceding sc~ulptors was
most worthy of his imitation, he received for answer,
"C None of them, but Nature herfelf." Lysippus fol-
lowed the advice, and carried the art of st~atuary to the
s~ummit of perfe~tion. It is well know~n that A3lexander
prohibited any other person but Lysippus from attempt-
ing to make his statue, as he had forbidden any body
but Apelles to draw his portrait : For he did not doubt
that the singular merit of those artists, as it would im-
mortalize their own names, would beffow additional
fame even on his, Lysippus is said to have wrought

?'rom thte death o~f Alexander the Great ti'll Greece became

a RPoman provoince, some time after the deflrutionbt of Co-
ri'nth.

THE beautiful days of Greece, to fruitful in great

en and in great aftions, are now past~; and

the few traces of ancient virtue that shall still appear,
may be compared to bursts of lightning in a dark night,
which thine but for a moment, and fervre only to make
the. gloom more conspicuously dismal.

Wie ihall now f~ee the chief officers of Alexander, to

the number of ten or twelve, making war on each other
for the s~pace of twenty years, to procure an independent
establishment in some portion of his vast empire. Some.
times pretended friends, sometimes declared enemies,
they embrace now one fide, now another, just as inte-
reft or caprice inclines them. We ihall fee IVacedonia

change

change its master five or fix times. W~e shall perceive
that Alexander, by pushing his conqueits to so immense
an extent, was the occasion of the utter ruin of his own
family, and of the total extirpation of his relations;
that murder and deftroution were the fruits of his con-
quelts, about which his generals slaughtered one ano·-
ther with the most thocking cruelty ; and that the states
of Greece were the villims of their quarrels. T~o enter
on a detail of the various events resulting from there
disputes among Alexander's captains, would be in es.
feat to write the hiffory of all the then known world in-
flead of that of Greec~e. Wie shall therefore contine
ourf'elves to the particulars immediately ref~peaing that
country, and paSs over the reft in silence; which we do
with the greater pleasure, as those other tranfa~tions
would present little els~e to the reader than one continued
scene of murder and the basest perfidy.

The Greeks mi~l make some efforts for regaining their

former independency. 13pt these are only the weak ex-
ertions of expiring liberty; and the princes to whorn
they apply for proteaion, instead of delivering thern
from their miseries, take advantage of their weaknefsi
to enslave them the more, and to make them fubf~ervi-
ent to their own defigns.-A·tt last the Romans, whos~e
power insensibly fwvallowed up that of all the other slates
in this hemisphere, fubjeEted them ~imperceptibly, pro-
claiming themselves all the while to be the deliverers of
mankind, and that they never made war but to reinstate
nations in their natural right s and liberty. But they
soon changed their tone, and di~tated their pleas~ure as
conquerors and sovereigns. The deftruation of Co-
rinth' at last convinced the Greeks of the necefirty they
were under of submitting to that warlike people; who,
under various pretences, totally subdued all the Rtates of
Greece, and added the whole of that country to the reft
of their great empire.

# CHAP. I. Affairs of Greece, from the death of Alexander the Great to the reduction of Sparta by Antiganus, after the battle of Selasia.

CH A P. I.

dffairus of Greece, froma the deazth of Alexander the G~reat
to the reduclion of Sparta by Antigonuts, after the battle
of S elajia.

THE generals of Alexander, after much altercation

and dispute, at length agreed to divide among

them the provinces of his empir-e in the following man-
ner. M~acedonia, Epirus, and Greece, were afig~Sned
to Antipater ; Thrace, and the neighbouring provinces,
to Lyfimnachus; Egypt, Arabia, and Libya, to Ptolemy_
the son of Lagus, whos~e successors in that government
were on that account called the race of the Lagidae;
Lycia, Phryg~ia, and the provincese of Asia Minor, were
given to Antigonus; Caria to Caifander; Lydia to ~Me-
nander; Little Phrygia to Lteonatus; Armenia to Neop-
tolemus; Cappadocia and Pamphylia, provinces not yet
thoroughly conquered, to Eumenes; Syria and Pheni-
cla to Laomnedon; the two Mledias to Perdiccas and
Atropatus ; Persia to Peuceftes ; Babylonia to A~rchon;
Mesopotamia to Arcefilas ; Parthia and Hircania to Phra-
taphernes ; BEaatriana and Sogdiana to Philip. Higher
Asia and the Indies were left to those put in poffeffion of
them by Alexander. Seleucus, the son of Antiochus,
was made general of the horse; and Caffander, fan of
Antipater, of the guards.

Of these governors several diftinguilhed themselves

by their extraordinary merit; but above all Eumenes, a
native of Thrace; obscurely born indeed, but whole
magnanimity and elevated fieatiments amply s~upplied
that deseRt, if it may be accounted one. Hlis eminent
abilities procured him the esteem, first of Philip, and
afterwar-ds of Alexander, with whom he poffeffed a high
degree of credit.

Statira, the widow of Alexander, and daughter of

Darius, foibon followed her unhappy father to the grave.

HWer death was brought about by the procurement of
Roxana, who Cfupe~ted her to be with child. Perdic-
cas was an accomplice in this murder.

The Greek colonies fettled by Alexander in higher

Asia, weary of living at foch a difiance from their native
country, resolved to return home; and uniting to the
number of so,ooo men, prepared for their departure,
without asking permiiron of Perdiccas. But intelligence
of their resolution coming to the ears of that governor,
he dispatched againit them a general called Python ; who
having found means to bribe 3000 of them to desert to
him, easily defeated the reft; of whom the greater part
were, in consequence of orders from Perdiccas, cut in
pieces by the IVMacedonians.

In the mean time, the news of Alexander's death ha-

ving reached Greece, occasioned an universal joy among
the Athenians, who immediately resolved upon war,
andl ofed their utmost endeavours with the reft of the
Rtates of Greece to persuade thern to enter into a ge.
neral confederacy for their common liberty. A power-
ful fleet is immediately fitted out; all the citizens able
to carry arms are inlifted; and an army under the com-
anand ofLeoithenes is sent against Antipater. Demoft.
henes then in exile at MR/egara, having employed his
eloquence to prevail on the states of Sicyon, Argos, and
Corinth, to accede to the confederacy; the Athenians,
itruck with this instance of his generosity, recall him
from banishment, and on his return march all out of
the city to meet him, to welcome him back, and to
ihow him every mark of honour and diftinflion. It is
observable, that Phocion opposed this war. Antipater,
informed of these tranfa~tions, took the field with no
rnore than a 3,000 Macedonians and 600 horse; and ad-
vanced towards Thessaly, a fleet I 1o galleys attending
him along the conft. But the army of the Athenians
and their allies being more numerous than his, defeated
him in the firit engagement, and obliged him to re-
treat., 'The Athenians having next year for med the siege of

~Lam~ia

Latmia in Macedonia, both . besiegers and besieged .be-
haved at first with great bravery. But Leonatus arri-
ving to the afifitance of Antipa~ter, an engagement en-
sued; wherein the Greeks, by means of their cavalry,
of which the greater part was raised in Thes~saly, ob-
tained the vi~tory, flew Leonatus, and obliged the city
to capitulate. Antipater however escaped out of Liamia,
and put himself at the head of his troops; but carefully
avoided another engagement, till Craterus thould come
to his assistance with, a fresh reinforcemenlt of troops.
There arriving foon,gfterwards, formed, on their junc-
tion with those of lAntipater, an army of 4o,ooo foot,
Sooo horse~, and 30po bowmen; while that of the Athe-
nians amounted to, no more than 25,ooo men and
8500 horse. A battle enfaing, the Greeks were de-
seated; owing almost entirely to the want of discipline
among their soldiers. The, allies having applied to An~
tipater for terms of accommodation, received for an-
[wfer, that he would treat separately with each of the
Rtates. Upon this the negociation was broken off; and
the allies, instead of remaining united, having dispersed,
Antipater pres~ented himflelf with his army before each
of their cities separately, and di~tated his pleasure to the
inhabitants.c

The Athenifans thus deserted by their allies, upon.

hearing that A~ntipater was advancing against them from
Thebes, deputed Phocion to go and meet him. Anti-
pater insisted, that the Athenians thould submit them-
se-lves entirely to his mercy; and with this hard condi-
tion they found themselves obliged to· comply. But
Antipater afterwards condiefcended to enter into an al-
liance with them, on condition of their delivering up to
him Demosthenes and Hyperides; of their restoring the
government to its ancient Rtate, when the public em-
ployments were conferred on the wealthier fort alone ;
of their receiving a garrison of his troops; and of their
repaying him the expences of the war.

After this, hearing~ that Demosthenes and Hyperid-es

had fled, he dispatched Archias in pursuit of them;q whov

finding

finding Hyperides in Egina, dragged him from the
temple, whither he had betaken himself for fananuary,
and sent him to Antipater, by whom he was put to
death. Archias having likewise difcolvered Demosthenes
in the island of Calauria, where he had taken refuge in
the temple of Neptune, endeavoured to persuade him
to go along with him to Antipater, by assuring him
that he would do himr no harm. But D~emosthenes,

juffly diffruitful both of the servant of the tyrant,

3 s2. and of the tyrant himself, drank of f the porifon

that he constantly carried about with him, which

a few moments after wards put a period to his glorious
life.

Demnofthenes was the prince of orators, as we have

already had frequent occasion to observe, andl as may be
more fully seen from the comparison drawn up by Quin.
tilian between his eloquence and that of Cicero. He was
likewise a profound politician, a~tuated by the warmest
zeal for the interest of his country, and the most vio-
lent detestation of every thing that favoured of tyranny.
Had the Athenians followed his advice, Philip never
would have been able to arrive at the sovereignty of
Greece.~

But it was the most extraordinary circumstance of all

in the charader of Demnofthenes as an orator, that he
never made a vain or ostentatious parade of his genius,
nor ever indulgeda himself in any flourish with the sole
intention of th~ining. His constant aim was to engage
the attentioni of his audience to thae merits of his cause,
and to convince their judgments. Some time after his
death the Athenians ere~ted a statue of brass to his mae-
mo ry.

TIhe Athenians soon became sensible, that, by s~ub-

jeff ing themnfelves to Antipater, they had affirmed a very
s~evere and imperious master. As the virtue of Phocion
compelled in a manner the admiration of this new -ty-
rant, several exiled citizens were permitted to return on
the interceflon of that celebrated Athenian. But a great
number of the poorer inhabitants voluntarily aband! I-ed the

the city. The government -however of Antipater was
exercised with great juffice; and public employments
were conferred on persons of merit alone. At the fame
time it is true, that men of faftious dirpfplitons, from
whom Antipater apprehended diflurbance, were exclu-
ded from all o~ffces in the itate; a measure, however,
that might perhaps redound no tles to the happiness of
Athens than to the quiet and s~ecurity of the tyrant.

Eumenies, in the mean time, was put in poffeili~on of

Cappadoci a.--Ptolemy, Craterus, Antipater, and An -
tigonus fall out, form confederacies against2 one another,
and Craterus Tperifhes in the dispute. Perdiccas dies in
an expedition against Egypt.--Antipater likEewife dies,
after naming Polifperchon his fauceffor in the govern-
ment, in preference to~ his own son Caiffander, who was
by no means destitute of merit. This behaviour of An-
tipater, in choosing, preferably to his own son, Po-
lifperchon a firanger, but the oldest of all Alexandelr's
generals, and a man of such, experience as the nation
itood in need of, cannnot be too highly commended.
But CaiFander, provoked at what he called his father's
injustice, resolved to form a party against Polifperchon,
and engaged in his favour Ptolemy an~d Antigonus ; of
whom the latter, having the command of the provmeces
of Asia Minor, was the most powerful of Alexander's
s~uccessors. Polifperchon, on the other hand, laboured
to firengthen his party; and the better to dispose
Greece to assist him, he re-eftablithed the slates in their
ancient independency, and recalled foch citizens as
were in banithment. But Nicanor, arriving in the
mean time at Athens on the part of Caff~ander, took pof-
f~eFlon of Pyreu~s. Soon after, Alexander, thie son of
Polifperchon, having come thither lik'ewif~e, under pre-
tence of assisting the inhabitants, but really to make him-
self master of the place, found the inclinations - of the
citizens much divided.

The moderation of Phocion proved his ruin. WMith-

ing always to aft as a mediator, he made it a rule to be-
have with candor and with mildness to the enemies of

his

his country. This was at last imputed to him as a crime.
He was mofi unjustly accused of keepirig up a trceafo~n-
able correspondence with Nicanor; and was, on that
account, degraded from his offi~ce of general, Phociona
having presented himself before the people, with an in,
tention to convince them of this innocence; they refus
f~ed to hear him, and condemned him to die. Every;
person of sense and virtue was ihockted at feeing the
man, who, by way of diftinaion, ofed to be called the
honaefl mant, treated in so cruel and unworthy a mnanner.
H~is friends took their last: farewell of him in tears, Pho-
clon himself behaved on the occasion with the agm~e tran.
quill~ity that had distinguished his: most glorious days,
and with that confidence which innocence alonie inspires.

After begging of one of his friends to intreat

3 x p his son, in his name, to pardon this piece of in-

juffice in the Athenians, he swallowed the hem.

lock jtuce.

W~e shall be the less surprised at this glaring instance

of injuffice, when we confider, that all power was
at that time in the hands of the most base and unworthy
members of the Raete; who being without any person
of sense and spirit to direa them, gave themselv~es up,
without controul, to the didat~es of caprice and pafflon.d
--To the ininflice and folly of such tumultuous affem-
blies, as that by which Phocion was condemned, did the
most virtuous men of this republic in former times owe
their ruin.

Phocion was educated in the school of Plato; and was,

perhaps, one of the most virtuous men that ever lived.
--Though almost all his life at the head of armies, his
love .of mediocrity still remained with him, and no man
e'ver carried disinterestedness to a higher pitch. Index.
ible in every point that regarded the interests of the
commonwealth, as we~ll as his own condua in life, he
conflantly preferred the good of the Rtate to all concerns
of his own; and in private life, although he was of the
mildest and most benevolent temper, yet he never in
any particular would depart from the floicall peculia-

rious manners of the age. H~is exemplary sobriety pre-
ferred him iiigorous and healthful to a very advanced

respondent to his owns An ronian lady having made

chosen general no fewne~r than four and fodrty times. But
it was a fixed maxim of his, that the juffeft wars weaken'
a Rtate, and that peace ought to be the obje~t of every

death, that his ungrateful country, ashamed of her

SDuring th~eji: thbje~tion to Ostffander, the Athenian s

enjoyed a Rtate of much tranquillity under the admini-
Otration of Demwetrius, wkho, so far from abusing his
power, behaved wNith fouch moderation that they hardly
perceived him to be their matter. He not only aug-
mlented the revenutes of thre repulblic, b~ut retrenched in
every department, except: that of religion, all expences
which feemled· calculated solely for luxfury and oftenta-i
tion. He remedied the abuses t'hart prevailed in the
matter of railing sepulch~ral mnonuments, and restrained,
as much as pofihble, extravagance in furniture and in
dress; and the poor citizens profited greatly by his;
prudene and attention. D~emetrius diftingulfhed hirn-
self as highly in his phi~losophical as in his political capa-
city. All the ancient authors are unamimous in pradirng
his virtue and the wisdom of his adminiffratiori; and
the-y rank him among the greateRt men that Athens ever
produced .

Polifperchon, hearing that Caff'ander had gotten pof-

feffionp o~f Athens, marched and laid siege to that city;
but the- belieged made so brave a refillance, that he was
forced to relinquish the enterprise.

Eumnenes having been about this time defeated in an

engagement by Antigonurs, was taken pr~ioner, and soon
after put to death. Of all the officers of Alexrander,
this was the wifeit and the most virtuous; the best com-
mander, the molt attful politician. He seems to have
-been on the whole the mos~t accomplithed man of his
time, and the worthiest of becoming Alexander's fuxc-
ceffor. But he had the mnisfortunle to lead an army
composed of different nations, furnished him by the
governors of provinces, each of whom aspired to be
commander in chief. He remained to the -lait inviolablyr
attached to the royal family. No consideration what-
ever could thake his integrity ; and he appeared, upon
all occasions, to be a~tuated by the jaiteft s~entiment~s
of honour. But there extraordinary qualities rendered
himr the more obnoxious to the fatraps, who envied the
superior accomplishments of so fkrilful an officer, efpect- all y

ally as he. owed his advancement not to birth or in'
trigue, but to his singular merit alone.

Olympias having been, jy Pioli~Fperchon, recalled in-

to M/acedonia, made herself miltrefs of that kingdom,
and put to death Aridens, who had borne the empty
title of king for the ipace of fix~E years. Euridice thlei
wi~fe~ of Arideus, Nicanor the brother of Caffander, to-
gether with a great number of Caffander's other friendsi
were likewise the vilkims of the cruelty of that princes~s.
But those cruelties did not long3 remain unpundhedd
Caffander having besieged her in Pidna, and obhlged her
to surrender at diferetionj the relations of the persons
the had caused to· be mulrdered, demanded vengeance for
those murders in the aiFembly of the Macedohlians. She
was accordingly condemned, and put to death
by the hands of her aceufers thesnfelves ; the 3'174
soldiers Sent for that purpose not daring to 14y
hands upon her.

ICaifander having led his army into Basotia, was

moved with compassion for the Thebjansj who, fined
the cleltru~tion of their city by Alexander, wandered
about from place to place, without any fixed habitation.
Gaiffandier resolved to rebuild their city. Several fitaes
of G~reece contributed to forward this generous and
humane undertaking. The A~thenianss In particlar, re-
built a part of the walls ; and Theb-es soon rec~overed its
'former splendor. After this, Caffander having marched
against Argoss that city su~rrendered to has without,
making any resistance ; and those in thec territory of
'Meffend followed its example.

About this time Demetrius, the son of ALntigonusi

began to make a figure. Plutarch draws an adiran-
tageous charafter of this prince, and distinguishes him
by the title of Poliorcetes, which signifies, the taker ofe
cities. He was the handsomest inran of his time. His
mnajeftic air, tempered by a pleasa~nt affable look, struck
the fpeftators at onc~e with awe and pleasure. He em-
ployed his leisure in giving most· magmificent feasts and
entertainments. But as soon as business called hua

H- he3 to

to the <'abrinet or to the camp, none exceeded him in
diligence and AivQiity, nor better fopported fatigue and
pain. He behatted with the highest refped to his pa-
rents, by whom he was most tenderly beloved.

Seleucus having conrquered Nicanor, and reduced un-

der his power M~edia and Sufiana, made his public entry
into Babylon. From this period is dated the aera of the:
Selencidae by which the Orientals reckoned their chro-
molog~y, as the Christians do by that of Christ. Seleus
cus rendered hims~elf beloved by his f~ubjeds, by the
nxildnefs of his government, by his juffice, and by his
humanity. Demetrius the son of Antigonus attempted
in vain to expel him from the~ province of Babylon. Se-
lencus, indeed, having been absent in Media, Demetrius
attacked and reduced the caffles of Babylon ; but was
soon after obliged to retreat to his fathdr in Aiia Mi.
m or.

The Macedonlians growing weary of the diviflons that

prevailed among the generals of Alexander, required,
that the young king, now about fourteen years old, who
was the son of Roxana, and bore the fame name with
his father, thou~ld be ser at their head. Caifander, dreadl
ing left that might interfer~e with his ambitious designs,
put to death privately both the young prince and his
another; and next year, in concert wxth Poifperchon,
he dispatched, in like manner, ·another son of Alexan-
der, called HerculePs, then a boy about ferenteen years of
age, who haid been born to that prince by Barfine, the
widow of MNemnon the Rhodian. Antigonus, on the
other hand, secretly put to death Cleopatra the fiffer of
A~lexander the Great,- an-d widow of Alexander K~ing
of Epire. Thus the general·s of Alexander had the
cruelty to extirpate the family of their sovereign, that
they mi-ght have no matter, and might hold their govern-
rnents in perfeft indeprendence. Ambition never flops
at the most detefiable crimes. But the p~rosperity of
those moniters was of thort duration; while, on the
contrary, Seleucus and Ptolemy, who nated on prin-

caples

ciples of ju~lice and clismency, became the founders of
latiting empires.

W~hile Athens enjoyed a slate of perfea tran-

quillity under the adminiffration of Demetrius g oG.
·Phalerius the deputy of Caff;ander, Demetrius
Poliorcetes appeared offPyreus, and blocked it up with
a fleet of ajo dhips. The Athenians being taken un-
prepared, with their harbour unguarded, Demetrius
catered the harbour ·twithout opposition and intimated
to the Athienians by a herald, that he was come to set
them at liberty, and to re-eftabliih ·their ancient formr
of government. The Athenians thinking it best to Aib·-
mit, sent ambassadors to treat with him, whom he recei.
ved in the most polite and obliging manner. De-
metrius proceeded to lay siege to the fortress of Mum.·
Chia, took it, dismissed the Macedonian garrison, and
rated it to the ground. Then he made his entry into A-
thens, and re-established the democratical form of go-
vernment, which had been interrupted for the space of
thirteen or fourteen years.

As Demetrius Poliorcetes entertained a very high e-

fleem for Demetrius Phalerius, he sent him, at his own
request, toa Theb~es. For though the Athenians had
creded 3oo statues to his memory, that philosopher was
-very ju~stly appreheative of the change which this revo*
Intion might produce in the disposition of that fickle
people. Accordingly he very soon saw his fufpicionas
verified. The Athenians, with a view of making their
·court to the conqueror, condemned their late virtuous
igovernor to death, ofed every means to render his me-
-mory odious, and overturned all the statues they had a
little while before creaed to his honour. On the other
hand, they heaped the moit exgtravagant honours on
DT)emetrius Poliorcetes and his father Antigonus, calling
-hag them their kings and tutelary gods, and carrying
.their pi~tures in the procellion at the fealt of Minerva.
Whbat a woPrthlefs, unaccountable, and degenerated
people I Demetrius Phalerius took refuge with Caffan-
d3er ; and after Caf fander's death, he put hims~elf under

H h the

the prote £ion of Ptolemy Soter in Egypt, who was the
proteaor' of all men of genius and learning. Demetrius
soon gained the friendihip of that prmce, and employed
binrfelf, during his retreatr, in the compolition o~f several
works on the fubjeR of government.

Demetrius Poliorcetes departed from Athens with a

.nlumerous fleet, to make the conquest of Cyprus. Ha-
ving made good his landing in the island, he imnmedi.
ately advanced against: Salamina; defeated MIenelaus,
phio defended that city; and battered its walls with ex-
traordinary warlike engines, and particularly the Hele-
polis, to which however the besieged found means to ser
fire in the night. Ptolemy informed by Menelaus of
the danger he ran of losing the island, hailened to its re-
lief with a powerful fleet. But he was totally defeated
by Demnetrius in a fea-fight. The consequence of this
v~i~tory was the redudlion of Salamnina ; of which, when
Antigonus received intelligence, he was seized with such
a transport of joy, that he sent his crown to Demetrius,
and gave him in the letter the title of I~i~ng. The E-
gyptians, on the other hand, beffowed the fame: title on
Ptolemy.

No man was more a~tive or laborious in war than

Demetrius ; who being uncommonly skilful in the me-
c~hanic powers, had an extraordinary turn for sieges, and
ftor the confiruaion of engines. His galleys of fifteen
benches of oars, and the engine called helepolisj, were
firikmng proofs .of his mechanical genius.

After gaining the vi~tory just mentioned, De-

8 o4. metrius resolved to besiege Rhodes, the capital

of the island of the fame name, a very rich tra-

ding city, forming by its~elf a powerful ifate, firmly at-
tached to PtolemyT. Demetrius failed against it with a
-pumerous fleet and an army of 40,000 men. The en-
glines used by him in this siege are much celebrated.
'The Rhodians took the wifeit precautions for making a
.vigorous resistance. Nothing could exceed the violence
ps the assaults made on the city by Demetrius, except,
Berhaps, the efforts of the besieged to ful~tain tholfe a&;

f5auqltss

faults, and to repulse the enemy. The besieged made
much use of engines, by which they threw fir'ebrands
and darts. Demetrius, finding his attacks on the fide
opfthe harbour ineffeatual, attempted it next on the land
fide, where he made use of an heleplolis which exceed-
ed in size any that hadl hitherto appeared. It codifiied
of nine flories, each furoithed with catapultae and balif.
ta:; it bore likewise two battering rams ·of a monfirous
fiize, fortified with iron; which, when moved by the u-
nited fIrength of soon men, had a prodigious force.
. But while he was assaulting the city with this dreadful
engine, several transports, loaded with provisions, ar-ri-
ved to the relief of th3 ~Rhbodians1. D~emetrius, after car-
rying on the fiiege for the fpacse of a whole year, and
performing incredible a~ions of peribnal valour, was at
last obliged to raise it, and to agre~e to a treaty with the
Rho~dians, extremely honourable for the latter. For it:
was thereby declared, that the republic of Rhodes th~ould
remain in poffefhron of all its rights, privileges, and li-
hjerties, without being fabjeat to any power wihatever.
SThe celebrated painter ·Protogenes happening to be
-at Rhodes during the course of this famous siege,
quietly prose~cuted his bufiners, without being in the
least difterbed by the noise of arms or the alar ms of
the· siege. Upon Demetrius asking him how he came
,to enjoy su1ch tranquillity ? "C Becaufe," answered Pro-
togenes, 'C I knew well that you had ~declared war as-
"L gainft the Rhodians, not against the arts." Deme-
trius went often to f~ee him wh7en at work. TPhe mnafter-
piece of this painter was, as we have mentioned above,
the pilture of Jalif~us, which even Apelles himself ad-
mired; an~d in which a dog was reprel~ented panting and
foaming at the month, as if after a hard chace. It is
reported of Proto~genes, that after having long endea-
voured to paint the foam itfuing from the mouth of the
?dog, without being able to execute it as he desired ; lo-
;Ting patience at last, he suddenly threw the sponge that
he made use of for rubbing away what seemed amiss, on

Sh 4 the;

the canvras, which exaatly produced the eff6 ~that the
painter desired.

Caff~ander about this time laid siege to A~thens. De-

metrius haltened to the relief of that city with a

g3.3 numerous fleet, and drove Caifander from At-

tic~a. On this occasion the A~thenians lavilhed

upon himn the highest honours, and the mofit exrtratia-
Igant flattery ; alligning him for an apa~rtment a quartrer
of the temple of` Minerva; which Demetrius, whose
debauch~es d~ifonoured his warlike exploits, polluted
with every fort of profana~tion, evien er~e~ting in it altars
to his courtezans. But not ~satisfied wi~th that, he obli-
ged the Athenians to furnish him without delay with
the fum of a 50 talents ; wh~ich was no soon-er del~iveredt
to him, than he Ibeff owed it in a present o~n L~amia his fai
Iv~ourite courteZgan. At this timne ~Demetrius pro~cured himL
self ro be declared commander in chief of the Greeks, by
an affembli~y of their Rtates holden at t'he tithmus of Co-
rmnth.

In the rnean time Antigonus aimed at noething; less

than to difpoffefs the other successors of A~lexzander,
namely, Caff~ander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptcolemy,
tof their refpeative governtnents. But those other go*
vernors pe~rceiving his intentions, formed a confederacy
~agajint hirn and· his son Demnetrius. A great battle was

fought in the neighb~outhood of iIprils in Phrygiag

Sos. where Antigonus was slain, and the co-nfedierates

obtained a signal viftery.

In cons~equence of this viffory, the confed~erated prin·

~ces added the damninons of .Antigonlus to Itheir former
poif feilonss ; and, after much controv~erty, they resolved
-to div~ide the whole empi~re of Ale-xander i~n :the fobllow-
)Ing manner ; Egypt, Libya, Arabia, and Ptaleffine, were
a-ssigned to Ptol~emyr;---1VMacedonia and ·Greece to Caf-
sander ;--Bithynia and Thface to Lyfim~achus;--and
Aifia, as far as the rivery Indus, to Seleucus. This last
territory, which comprehended all the provinces of the
pancieat Periilm emspire4 was called ths~ Rindiom ofSyria, beo

pec;~iade tie Selerucitdre, its kings of the ·race of Seleucus,
-ded at Antioch, a city of Syria.
SIn the meain time -Demetrius appeared before Athens,
an.~)d deadeed~i~ ·admittan~e into that city. B3ut the un-
· for~tuatae situati~on of his affairs encouraged the Athe-
rtlaris to refuse to' comply with. his i-equeft. They re-
assened :him for answer, that they would receive within
he-~irti- gates no king wha~itever.

wanretrius having effe~ted a reconciliation with S~elen-

cazls, applied himf~eltf to the re-eftablithment of his affairs.
Its marched against Athiens, full of refeatment for the
anigrateful treatment he had met with from its inhabi-
tants; and he blockaded the city so clo~sely, that he soon
re~duced them to the last -extremity, and obliged them
to open their gates, and to receive him as their conque~-

te. av~ing assembled the inh~ab~itants in the theatre,

he furroi3ndedd it with armed men. B~ut after throwing
thie -Athenians into the irroft violent terr-or imaginkible,
he fu~Pddenly afizmred an ai~r of aI~ability, and declared,
thlat he freely forgave them. Frorir Athens he marcihed
againtt the Ltacedemlonians, with an intention to subdue
thiat warli~ke people; and ~coming to an engagement
with their king Archidamus, who had marched out to
op~pos~e him in the neighbourhood of M~antinrea, he g~ain-
ed a great vi~tory. In a second engagement nrear Spar-
ta, he c~ut in pieces soo. Spartans. After this, it was
not doubt-ed that Sparta, which had never h~itherto,
been in polffi-iron of any enemy, thould be taken by
Demetriuis. But some other affairs s~uddenly requiring
his appearance in another quarter, Sparta etlcaped once
more.

It wttas about this time that Sele~ucus built on the Ibanks

oif the Tigris the city ps S~eleucia, which afterwards be-
ca~rte ro ~famouS.

Pyrrhus the renowned King otfEpire, who in thle f~e.

quel distinguished himnfelf as the best general of his time,

ani already to appeay. He was the so~n of Eacides king

king of the M/oloffi. Having, while yet an infant, nar.
rowly es~caped from the hands of the reibels who had de.
throned his father, he was carried into Illyrium, and
there educated. After being reff~ored to his kingdom,
he was again driven out of it by the- Moloffi, who had
taken advantage of his ablence to rife in rebellion, and he
was obliged to take refuge with Diemetrius his brother.
in-law, with whom he was present at the battle of Ipsus,
where he greatly distinguished himnfelf.

He went afterwards to the court of Ptolemy;i where

he displayed extraordinary skill in every kind of manly
exercises, became a favourite of the whole court by his
generous and obliging behaviour, and showed that he
was poff~effed of remarkable abilities. Hfe had great
ciommand of temper, was mild and accessible, delighted
every body by .his a~ffability, and in point of military
ikill was generally preferred even to Demetrius. But
be was of a lively impetuous disposition; and his reftlets
temper and unbounded ambition, never would permit
himn to remain in quiet. Here he took to wife Antigo-
ala, the daught~er of Berenice, the wife of Ptolemy;
and having by the interceio~n of that princess obtained
a fleet and some money from~ Ptolemy, he with that as-
fiftance regained poffeflion of his kingdom. A~fter this
he made an alliance with Lyfimrachus; and attacked Ma-
cedonia, then in poffeflon of Demetrius, on the one
fide, while Lyfireachrs~ attackred it on the other. The
army of th~e latter, difguffed by the haughtiness of his
deportmenrt, deserted4 from him, joined Pyrrhus, and
proclaimed him king of Macedonia. But he soon loft
that kingdom, and was obliged to return into Epire.

Cline~as, a native of Thessaly, who had been a scholar

of Demosthenes, and was a span of an excellent under-
itanding, was the favourite and confident of Pyrrhus.
This man frequently rgprelented to Pyrrhus, in the most
firiking manner, the inlutility of his ambitions projeats;
and proved to his conviftion, that it was as much in his
power to enjoy, at the time he was arguing with. hun,
the quiet and good cheer ~which Pyxrhus hiwfelf pro-

sessed

feffeid to be- the end of all his undertrkingfs, as it would
becafetr he thould have exposed himself to the number-
ei~ ~toils and dangers that he Mas continually~ meditating,
B~ut though Pyrrhus was obliged to assent to his opinion,
yet he found it impofirble to reffrain his turbu-
lent ambition; which, after a variety of other 1 89.
exploits, promlpted him to undertake an expedi-
tion even into Italy against the Romans, with whom he
fought three battles.
SAfter gaining, by the means of his elephants, the
first battle, Pyrrhus feat Cineas to Rfome with offers of
pea~ce; which by the advice of Appius Claudius were
riejeated by the fCenat~e. ~Cineas, on his return, gave
his. ma~ter the most lofty idea of the Roman people, de-
[cdribing the senate as an assembly .of so many kings.
T~he Romans, in their turn, sent ambassadors to Pyr-
rhus, to convince him of his folly in making war upon
them, and of the danger in which it might eventually
involve him. Pyrrhus made the most tempting offers
to Fabricius, who happened to be one of the ambaffa-
dors, to engage him to enter into his views : -but Fa-
bricius discovered by his answer a greatness of foul in-
finitely superior to all corruption. "C Do -you retain
*~ your wealth "· said he, "C and I will preserve my po-
-* verty and integrity." Pyrrhus, however, peirfifted
in his pradtices on Fa-bricius, and made him more tempt-
ing offers still to bring him over to his fide. B~ut that
generous Roman rejeated them all wvcith the fame firm-
-ness and magnanimity, Next year Fabricius transmitted
to Pyrrhus a letter, wrtiten by the physician of that
prince, wherein be offered to poison ·the king his ma-~
fier, provided the Romans would reward him fultably
for his pains. Pyrrhus, struck with so high an instance
of Roman generosity, set all his prisoners at liberty
without a ranfomn, and offered more advantageous terms
-fs peace than before; to which, however, the Romans
wPould by no means heairken.

Ac sec~ond battle was then fought between Pyrrhus and

the

the Romans near 'the city of Afculum; where both
parties exerted extraordinary efforts of bravery, and
the night alone put an end to the engagement. The
loss was nearly equal on both sides, but the best troops
ofPyrrhus were cut off.

About this time happened a famous ir~ruption

sq 8. of the Gauls into the more polithed and~fruitful

countries of the souther parts of Europe. A

vast fwrm of those barbarians, leaving their native re-
gions of the north, proceeded southwards, and appear-
ed very unexpededly ·on the frontiers of Macedonia;
where Ptolemy Cerannus, who then poffieffed that king.
dom, having ventured to give them battle, was totally
defeated and slain. Tihe viatorious Gauls, after this
foccefs, divided their forces into two parties : one of
which tools the rout towards Thrace; while the other,
under Brennus, dire~ted their course to Greece. Bren-~
nus having made himfelfP master of the pass of Thermo-
pylrre after so~me opposition, advanced to Delphos, with
an intentiors to plunder the rich temple of Apollo. 3But
the Greeks, anxious for the pres~ervation of so sacred a
place, quickly affemrbled a powerful armny, charged the
Gauls with their u;ual bravery, further heightened on
this occasion by all the fury of religious wzeal, and ob-
tained ai complete vi~tory, Brennus, out of despair for
the loss of the battle, killed himself. Such of the
Gauls as remained, endeavioured to retreat by the
-famne road that had conduated them into Grelece; but
they were most~ly 4dcitroyed, either by famine or by the
sword.~

The Syraculans having applied to Pyrrhus for assist-

anrce agai-nst the Carthaginians, that prince left Italy,
:passed over to Sicily, and tools poffeflion of Syracuse;
w~here, having received moneyl an~d a fleet from the Sy-
racufatns, he fell upon the Carthaginians, and ruined
their power in that island. 3Encouraged by an ·uninter-
rupted course of prorIperity, PyrrhU~s began to meditate
the conquelt of A~frica, intending to make his son He*
genus sovereign of Sicily. But his good fortune had

greatly

greatly altered his temper. He was now grown over-
bearing and tyrannical: And his sole aim being to pro.
core money to support the expence of his luxury and
extravagance, he employed the most opprefirve mea-
thre~s for that purpose; beffowed all offices on his own
favourites ; and, inficad of judging· according to the
laws, was guided by interest and caprice alone. This con-
du&t soon alienated from him the affe~tion of the people s
and Pyrrhus perceiving himCelf to be the objeat of pub-
lic batred, became a downright tyrant, put to death
unde'r various pretences the most illutErious citizens,
and rendered himfel~fd~etefied by all the Sicilians. a
ving undertaken another expedition into Italy, at the
in~tigation of the Samnites and Tarentines, he plunder-
ed on his way the temple of Proserpine at Locri. But
being overtaken by a violent tempeftt, his f~uperitition
was alarmed, and he sent back the riches he had thence
abftradaed.~

Pyrrhus gave. battle to the Romaans a third time, near

Beneventum, and was defeated. But this ·disaster by
'ro means d~iscouraged him. For it was a diftinguithing
circumitance in the charader of Pyrrhus, that he re-
mained firm and undismayed in the mid~it of the greateit
misfortunes. Though he had now bixt a [mall army re-
rirt~r~rtrnai~ning, and no money at all to support it, he never-
thelefs passed over into Macedonia, where ;Antigonus
the son of Demetrius was then reigning, attacked that
prince, defeated him, and in a thort time reduced all
the cities of IMaedonia.

Wmhile the other Rtates of Greece ignominiously bowed

the neck beneath the yoke of Alexander's fTucceffors,
Sparta alone appeared to be re-animated by the ancient
spirit of the country, and by that noble intrepidity
which had formerly procured her the pre-eminence over
all her neighbours. Cleonymus, the fan of Cleomenes
king of Sparta, provoked at some part of the behaviour
of his fellow-citizens, solicited Pyrrhus to march with
an army against Sparta. That prince complied with
the mnvitationj; an~d entering Laconia with an armyr of

of 25,a00 men, ravaged and plundered the country a,
round. The Lacedet~inonians sent amnbaffadors to treat.
But Pyrchus, without coming to the point, amused the
amnbaff~adors with flattering speeches and compliments,
and advtaned that fame night to the very gates of'
Sparta.

Thoug~h the Spartans, who expelted nothing less,

were much surpris~ed at this fiep, yet they were by no
means discouraged, bjut labioured-for the remaining part
of that night with the utmost expedition to throw up
entrenchments, . In this work they were afirftled by their
wives and young women; who, after c~ompleting a third:
part of the entrenchment by themselves, presented arms
to all the young nien, and exhorted them to acquit
themfelvres as they ought. Next day Pyrrhus mlade dif-
politions for attacking the city a but met with a far
more vigorous refifftance than he had expefted. A
young Spartan, of a very handfomne person, named
Acrpates, the son of King Areus, distinguished himnfelf
particularly on this occasion. All the Spartans indeed
fought with the most remarkable bravery ; and after a
long contest repulsed the troops of Pyrrhus. Next day
the attack was renewed; and the Spartans, instead of
failing or being discouraged, seemed rather to be infpi-
red with additional. valour. Their womren attended
themn during the whole engagement, supplied them with
arrms and drink, and carried off the wounded. But
this desperate resistance only made Pyrrhus redouble his
efforts. At length he was shocked at the dreadful car-
nage occafroned by his obstinacy, and resolved to re*
tire.

Pyrrhus, solely intent on war, marched, upon the

invitation of Aritteas, the head of a faftion in APrgos,
against that city, which was diffra~ted by intestine diif-
fenflons. Areus king of Sparta laid an ambuicadle for
htim on his way thither, and cut in pieces his rear
guard, together with Ptolemy his son. Pyrrhus, exal-
perated by the loss of his child to a degree of despair,
throwsi himself into the midst of his enemies, drives his-

3 borfe

horife against Evralcus the cominander of the Latcede-;
mnonian cavalry, transfixges him with a javelin, and com-
mits a frightful slaughter among the belt troops of the
enemy around the body of Evalcus. Pyrrhus on all oc-
cafions was terrible in battle, but that day he Surpassed
himself. In this engagement the Spartans loft the flower
iof their soldiers.

As soon as Pyrrhus arrived before Argos, he was ad-

mitted into the city by Arifteas and his fadlion- The
Argives fled to the citadel,- and begged affillance of
Antigonus, who lay encamped hard by the city. IKing
Areus having come likewise to the relief of the Ar-
gives with a choice body of Spartan soldiers, Pyrrhus
re~solved to march out and give them battle. But hap-
pening to embarrals himself in a narrow lane, where he
could neither advance nor retreats and being at the
fame time attacked by the enem~y, he throws himself
into the mnidit of them, and is wounded by a javelin
thrown from the hand of a common soldier. Pyrrhus
turned about to firike the soldier : but a poor woman,
wbho was looking at the engagement from the top of a
houre, perceiving that it was- her own son whom Pyr-
rhus was going to firikre, discharged a large tile on the
head of Pyrrhus, who fell mortally wounded from his
hors~e, and a soldier cut off his head. Antigonus soon
got pof~feffion bot~h of the camp and army of Pyrrbus,
but behaved with great generosity to his son Helenus.

Thus fell Pyrrhus, one of the most fkrilful commande
ers of his time. Of this we cannot doubt, since Livy
informs us, that ]Hannibal, on being afkred by Scipio,
Whom he esteemed the best general that had ever lived ?
made ans~wer, That he ·accounted Alexander the best,
Pyrrhus the second, and himself the third. He added,
that no general excelled Pyrrhus in the art of drawing
up an army ; of choosing; the most advantageous ground;
and of gaining the esteem and confidence of his A~ldiers.
It is certain, however, that Pyrrhus was not poffeffed
of all the qualifications requisite in a great commander.
HEe commiitted inlaincmrable blunders, continually exr-

plofed

posed his pierson lik~e a fimnple volunteer,' blindly under,
took expeditions without proper examination or reflec.
tion, and a~ted upon no fixed plan. Hence we fee
himn perpetually floc~tuating and changing from one pro-
j-ef to another, just: as· his restless ambition inclined
him#.

Antigonus, to dissolve an alliance concluded

268. between the Spartanls and Athenians, laid siege

to Athens, and tooka it.

T'he Achean republic, composed of twelve inconfide-

rap~ble towns in the P8eloponnese, hiad been subdued like
the other slates of Greece in the time: of Alexander. It
had remained fub~jea to the Madedonian power ever
since; but had often changed its matter of late, having
been sometimes under the power of Demetrius, some-
times under that of Caffander, and fometimnes ~under
that of Antigonus. At last they found means, in the
time of Pyrrhus, to expel the tyrants imposed upon
them by Antigonus ; and they formed a firia union un.
der the form of a single republic governed by a general
council.

About this time Sicyon groaned under the tyrannyf

of Nicocles. But Aratus, the son of Nicias, one o
the principal citizens, though then only twenty years
of age, conceived the design of setting his country at li-

berty. aving concerted the ne-ceffagry meas~ures with

the utmost prudence, he sealed the walls of the city;
and after effe~ting, by that means, his entry, he called
aloud on the inhabitants to assert their -liberty. They
immediately obeyed the welcome summons, ~set fire to
the tyrant's palace, and recalled furch of their number
as were banished. Aratus, to render the liberty he had
chus procured to his country more durable, persuaded
the Sicyonians to accede to the Achean league. For
though the fmnall republics, united in that league, were
but weak ; yet, by the wildom of their general council, and

and 2by their- perf~ed unionJ they ·were enabled to mai~n-
taizn ~their independ~ency.
r- r·~atus, biy h~ig virt~tuous an~d predent co~ndsh~~, acquil
yied ftrill,moste and more th~e efientm of his fellowT-ditizens,
.fle was not, however, a mazn· oifa perfed or of an.equal
ch-ara~cter. He wcas in paLrticular very deficient in mili-
ttay Imerit. For thou~gh at fame tim~es he neted:·\w7ith
~great vigour and resolution, yet the ·view of danger of-
ten :t'endered him timo~rous and irrefointe. · Being cabo.
feri-a. second -time general of the Acheanrs, he .rec~overed
fronoiiAntigonu s- the -citadel of Corrinth, whereof: that
pairiice had gotten poffetiton. This was a place of great
Iimportance. Being situated on a hill, in the- mifiddle
6- the- ZIthmnus, which s~eparated. the Peloponnef6
foiom the continent, -it corrnmanded-;the sea and land· on
both sides, and ih a great mea~ire~ prevented all· c~om-
mafhi~cation wi~ith th-e -Peloponnese. By thes~e means it
gain its poffeffr the high~est· Siflutence in the affairs of
Grieece, and -was ~therefore ani objeat of jealounfy among
al the neighbouring powers.

A~tratusb had pr~orifed sixty talents to an inmhabita-nt of

Gjo~rinth, who undertook to con~du' him to the citadel;
by a fmnall path cut out of the rock on which t~he for-
,tieds wais:buil. · B~ut- being unrable ·to adv~ance· the whole
sant· immedis-e~ly, he was obliged to pawn the greatest
par~t of his plate, together with his wifers jewtcus, for
chi~ balance. This wtas ·an inttan~e of magnanimity,
abinpariable,' in the bpinion of Plntarcsh, to any of the
.· iefti · thininig aftionis of Grec~ian heroism. Fo·r here A;-
··abuss- n~ot only s~acri~ficed his whodle estat~e --to tahe welfare
640h tsountry, but likewnife· exposed his life to the most
hISilmninet danger. Aratus refiolved to make the attempt
iilbrh night, taking along wi~th him 400 fold ier s.
Herficc'~edede in -he·-enterpr·ifie; dlrove out the e- Id49
nafKiij, and took poffTeffion of thle citadel. The
·Cejfiinthians thereup~on .joyfully opened their gates to
him,~ PCcdeded likewtifie, by 'his perbi~ation, to the Achean
'~teague, ·and put a garrison ·into~ the citailel. This dairin

and -indu~cbd the M~egareans, together ·with fever~al-othe
itates, and even King Ptolemy ·himself, to join the A-
ehean ltague. ·The Achbans,- -sensible t~hat the sole aim
of Aratus was their` conmm~on adva-ntag:e ; that he was a
Profefied enemy of every ~species of tyranny, and high-
ly desirous of refforing their cities to their ancient liber-
ty; continued him without interruption in the chie~fmi-
li~tary, commlnand.

bout~ this time the Romans began to make their

power refpe~able even? among the Greeks. They sent
an -ernhaffy to tfhe A~cheans and .1Etolians, to persuade
them to gudaranty a treaty of peace that they had con-
cluded wai~th T~euta the widow of one' of the kings of
Illyrium. ·This country was then governed by a parcel
of petty princes, who 1peffered all their neighbours with
their pirac~ies.; and ·hatii~ng lahtly ventur;ed to meddle
withat-he effeas-:of fobme of the R~oman citizens, they had
provokied that ·republic to attack Qgueen T~euta, whom the
Romans obliged to abanderalllyrium entirely. On account
of this important service, the Corinthians passed a public
decree ad~mitting the· Romans to the Ifthmick games;
and,the ·Athenians prefeated them with the freedom as
thec3ir~ city.

::A £etof tyrarits having been planted in many of the
cities of Greece by the.,power of the IVacedonian prin·
aes, Aratus.dire~ed his principal attention to the ex-
tirpat~ion of that vermin, who oppressed and ruined the
refpe~ive Rates in which they had been placed. On
this account, one of thorfe tyrants, and the moflt wiked
of them all . called Ari/hppuss who . derni~neered at Ar-
goPs, ·xernployed, thPny schemes,~ to accomplifhi the de-
itruailon of Aratus - This Aristippus lived in conti-
trual apprehe~ntisn, and whas constantly busied in contri-
-vmg precautions for securing his life. .For that purpose
he retained a body of armed men to guard. his hoofe
night and day. He·alept in an upper chamber, to which
he mounted by a ladder; the only entry being by a
trap-door,. which was-·hut wh~en the tyrant entered, and
his bed placed~ above it. It is ,probable, however, that

he:

while A-ratus, on the:contrary, appeared always in pu-
biopw·ithcout arms and ·withouat fearJ attejnded 'by nd

That virtuous republican having at last conie to an~ en-
g~agement with Aristippus, gained a complete~ viatoryg
ove~r.the tyrant, who was citlled in ·the battle. Araitus'
nexttperlfuaded Lyfindes, tyrant ofliegalo'pol~isj verin~
tar$ily to resign his forereignty, and to reffesre that ci~ty
to.its -former li~berty;

.:Agis King of Sparta, though no miore thain twentyr
years of age,- laboured to bring about a reformation -in
that ci~ty, where luxury and avarice had olf a long w~khile
iicquired a footing; and to inforce ·the ryltem d~tiablihedi
by Lycurgus. Such an undertaking requtire~d a man-·off
auvry. differentf cha~ra~ter from Agi: .whoi besides his
want of'years and experriene, was of too mild and iiir-
refolutte a difpolition. The youth,' however, inod·-thet
peoplIe~ in g~eneral, highly applauded the design. But
-it was~ apposed by th~e rich, w~ho were headed by his
colleague Leonidas. The reformation- therefoi~e toole
~plaice only in part, ~Agrs 111mf~elf havring s~et the ~ex;am~ples
byd-:haringC all his wealth with his -feffow citizens.

Whi~Tllle ·things were in this iCauation at Spatra,· the Asj

cheans being at war -with the .1Etoians, begged assist-;
ance fromn the Lacedemonians ; wvho sent th~em1 atelar~my
under· the commnand of Agis. The Lacedemoniain auxi
iliaries joined Aratus at Corinth ; but upon the Acheans
declining to come , to an' engagem-ent with the ehemysr
Ag~is returned to Sparta. On arriving at that city, he
found the people erafperated and pihirited up against
hiiin by the machinations of A gefilaus, on~e of the priti~
cipal citizrens, who acculed· him of having- impose-d ortd
the people, by perfuladinge ·them that an ·equal divrifion
of e~ffeats would be birougrht abo·ut ?

. Leonidas, who had be·en deposed-, an~d.in ~where place
Cleom~brotuls his fon-in-law had been ina~de king, wcas re~
called ·and replaced on the th~rone. L~eonidaS highly en-
raged. against Cleonbr~otusq.for hav!ingS~o~uefope his diga3

rlity, vented againRt him the bitterest reproaches, and: ex-
pelled him thie city.~ Then he applied himself to accom-
plifh. the ruin of Agis, who being decoyed from his a-
fyhum, was thrown mnto prison. Leonidas having gained
over the Ephori to his fide, brings Agis to trial for at.
Remptmng to mntroduce innovations in the government.
-Agis was condemned to-death, wi~thout so much as be-
rng -allowed the privilege of d~efend~ing himself, and with..
ou~t being tried by his fellow-citizenzs; and he was after-
wards firangled in prison. The people hearing what was
pailing, were provoked .at the injuffice of the proceed-
angs- agasnlt their king, and made an infurreaion to s~ave
his life. But their zeal served only to hasten the fate

So~s that unfortunate prince ; whose mother and

a-44. g.randmother havin~g gonre to the prison and de-

mande~d.acef~s to him, were laid hold of and put

to death like wif~e. W~hat accumulatedc horror! And what
a chang~e in Sparta!~

Leoni~das having died soon after, his sori Cleomenes

mounted the throne. This prince being of an aftive
enterprising diifpoitionr, and extremely defiroas ofglory,
beheld with pity the citizens of Sparta abandoned to
luxury .anrd indolence, and careless about the public
~welfare. Perceiving the whole power of the thate to
b~e in- the hands. of the Iphori, he resolved to attempt to
change the form of government;, and hoping that war
thould· enable him to accompliih his designs, he took
rxccallon, from- some. aas of hofii~ty committed by Ara-
tas on the territory of the Arcadians, to declare war a-
gainft the Acheans; and imnmediately takring the field
wnt~h an army,. off~ered the enemy battle. Aratus, dif.
raayed at the b~oldness of Cl2eomenes, whom he had hi-
therto con~sidered as an inexperi~enced young man, re-
treated ; and thereby incu-rred- severe reproaches from his
own soldiers. Cleomenes, emboldened· by his success
against Atatu~s, pushed his advantage, and beat the A-
cheans· n lev~e~a~l -kirmithes.

Having by, these means greatly advanced his authority

at Spar ta, -he.no doanger hesitated to put his -design in

exe-

execution. But before entering that city, he Sent for-
:ward privately a body of armed men, who surprising the
Ephori while at table, killed four of them. Then Cleo-
menes ass~embling the people, represented to them hour
enormonfly the Ephori' had abufred -their power; ace-
.quairnted them with his design of reviving the laws of
Lyc~ur~gus; and to convince them of the sincerity and
·uprightness of his intentions, immediately made an e--
~qual divilion of his own wealth, and prevailed on his
friends and relations to follow his example. Thert--h~e
applied himself to restore the laws of Lycurgus, teach-
ing~ the education of the youth, the exercifres, and the
public tab~les; and the citizens cheerfully conformred
theinfelves to this change of life.

A~t he fiaame time, to ihow his enemries that therei- inne-

wations had not diminiihed the affet-io~n entertained for
him by his countrymenn he attacked and laid walte the
territory of MLegalopolis, and carried offl a considerable
booty. Besides all this, ·the plainnels and simplicity of his
dress, the frugality and sobriety of his -table, and the as-
f'aility of his deportment, thewed that he meant to
:form the citizens by his own example. But he fludied,
above all, td' gain the confidence and affe £kion of his
troops; ·and with success, for they teffified great: ar-
dobur to fight under his cognmand. Availing himself
-' fthis favourable difpolition in the soldiers, he tools
the field against the Acheans, gained a great vi~t~ory
over ahem, and forced them to sue for peace; which
~Cleomnenes codfented to grant, on condition of their
-chooting him commander in chief of the forces of. the
14iague. -

T~he Acheans seemed dispos~ed to comply with this

'condition. But Aratus, who had now enjoyed the com-
nt~and three and thirty years, regarding it as an affront,
resolved to engage Antigonus in the affair. For this
purpo'e he made application to that prince in an indi-
reft manner, by two citizens of Megalapolis; which
city being in the neighbourhood of Sparta, was much

li 3 exm

exposed to the -iricurflons of the enemy. ·Those two
M~e~galopolitans reprefeated to Antigopnus, that Cleomne-

aiesapired at the cotzqueft~, not only of the Peloponnese

'but of al Greece; that it was the interest of Antigonus,
to prevent the execution of there ambitious designs;
-that they had good" reason to believe that Aratus wou@d
Ib~e incin~ed to co-operate with him in proper m-easures
for:-th:t erid j and th~at as a securi-ty for the sincerity and
attachoien of the Acheans, they wvoutld put hirn in post-
:feffiah ~of the citadel of Corinth. Antigonus, to who~m
this ·afforad~ed a flair opportunity of i~ntermeddling in the
a'ffaws -of Greece, like-ned writh pleafore to the proposals
of the Megalopolitans, and promnifed to assist them, pro.
Yidmng the agreement were approved of by the Acheans,
wrhoi bemng accord;ingl informiied ·of the dispositions of
Atntigonus, resolved, by the· perfuaiion of Aratus, to
contmnue the war. Cleomenes having thereupon feizedi
on several cities in the Pelopennefe, the Achean~s imme-
dfiately begged of ,Antigonus to come with ~all diligence
to their afimftane.r -

That prince o -bey~ed the invitaticin advanced to sup.

port them with an army of so,00:e foot and I4oo horse;
and after several events, of which it would be too tedii
ous to etee-r into a m~iinute detail, made .himself master
of Mnt-inea and Orchomene, and reduced Cleomenes
to· the necefi6ty· of· defending aconia. This did not,
however, discourage Cleomenes; who setting at liberty
a great number of the Helots, on their paymng him a
pertamn fum of money, armed n000 of them after the
M~lacedonian fafihion, and carried by assault the city of
M~egalopolis after a faint resistance. Then he offered to
the qMegalopolitans, who had taken refuge with the
Maffeienisns, to reffore to th~em their city on condition
sos thei-r renouncing the Achean league. But the Me-
~galopoh~tans rejedted the propofal,being· reso~lved to ad-
here~ to their engagements though at' the expence of
t~heir city and territory. Cleomenes, provoked at their
refuthl, gave th city up to be plundered, and demo-

SThe Acheans at lengt~h ·discovering, that i~nfendrezf an

repented when too late of their condriai~. Perceiving,
however, that fubmillion. was now their fa8feft coorfre,
they beharved to Antigonas .with' the grossest and bafelt
flattery. They even offered faerifi~es to him. Aratus
no longer poffeffed any poweir h or could he to much~
:as prevent Antigonus from rep~lacing thie statues of the

Stjrants, which he~hrnimfel'f had overturned.' Thhus was ~A-
ratus justly punished for his jealoury :o~f'a~ieontenes

1WyM~cedonians had ~left their w~rinter-qriarters, rimiade a in-
curflon into the territory of Argos, a~nd laid wta~it the
country. Hit~herto he had had· the glory of holding at

L~acon-ia from invasion. But ·ii '(he enfulng fu~immer,

tackedd Cleometnes who had an~T~only2000 m~n. The
battle began near Olympus, an~d both pjarties fought
with the greatest obitinancy. Burac last the Macedonianm
phalanx r'ihing forwards on the Lacedemorians· :widsr
their ifpears couched, drove them horcin their entrenc~h-
ments. 1Moit of the auxeiliary troops fell in this battle y
and Plutarch s~ays, that of 6000 Spartans only 260 !re-
maiined alive. Antigdnus owed his viiaory in a ,great
meathre to the co~urage of Philopoemen, yet a very
young man, who fou~ght at the he~ad of th'e Ach~ean ca-

Ivalry. Thoiigh the loss of this battle threatened Sparta- with
ctt~er ru~in, yet that people supported their defeat with
the fame conitancy and magnanimity that they trad dif~
played in the most flourishing times of their republic.

~--HE .2Etolians, the most unpoliihed people of Greece,
. who were- inured to all the .hardships of war, ·qud-

li ed by robbery. and plunder, had lately: begun to make
a difti;nguiihed figure in that country. Taking advan-
tpge of the exhad-edl ·ituation: of the PeloponnefiranS;
who ~were greatly reduced by the. l twar, and fiver the
hattle of Selaila were desirous, of peace and quiet, they
eade aln irruption into the te·yrriory of 1Veiefene, and
unmitted great ravage and devalation.· Upon this
tA~rgus marched against thern ~with the Ac-heans. But
I~iqg been defeated near Caphia, that general became
more timo~rous and irresolute than~ eve~r, and the Ache.
sass:mere obliged t~o apply for .afi~ia~nce to Philip the
youp-ig -ing of Maaceden, who had Raicceeded to that
kingdom on the death of his father Antigonus.

'being harassed by theb , tOliaDS, having come to Co-
tialth,. wrhere a general assembly of the Acheanswa
fben holden.; procured war to be declared against the
JEtolians. This happened during the siege of Sagun-
tUm by the famous !-ansnibal, who passed from thence
fnate Italy. O~l~eompnes in the mnearr time ended his days mifera.
bly .in Eg~ypt. Having been reinderel 'fuirpeated to the
'iw king, who minded nothll but his plealizres, he was

Sthrown

thrown ·inta prifoin. H~is friends found means to deliver
hiin froni his confinement, -set him at their head, and
attempted to excite a' rebellion in the city, by invi.
ting the people to affrert their liberty. But no person
daring to join them, they were seized with despair s and
to avoid the thame of a disgraceful public punithment,
agreed to kill one 'another. When the king was in-
fosrmed -of wPh'at' had ·passed, he most inhumanly ordered
the mother and children ·of ·Cleo~menes to be put to
death; and the body of that .brave but unfortunate
prince to be affixed to a cro~ss.

`Philip having miade preparaticins for attacking the JE.

tolians, engaged several of the princes of Illyrium to afi
sift hitn, ·and, among the' refit, Demelt~rius of Pharus, a
bold iind enterprising, but a rat~h man, who on being
expelled his own territories by the ~Romans, had chofenr
the couirt o~f Ptolemdy for an asylum. The Acheans
likewise applied for affiiftance to. thei~r allies; but the peo-
~pl-eof IAcarnania- and- Epitrus alone ·granted them the
fccorts~ daemanded. Philip fetrig `o'ut from IMacedo-
nia with an army of' I ,ooo men, tenteed JEtolia, and
reduced a great number of towns. On the othier hand,
3Dorkinachus the JEtoliari generail avaged the country
of Epirus.----P·~hlip being joined at Caphia by- a body of
troops under Aratus the younger, formed ·in conjunc-
tion wiPith hbim th~e siege of Pfophis, a city: of Arcadia;
and having in the height of winter made himnfelf matter
of the fort, which by its situation was accounted impreg-
nable, he delivered it- to- the Acheans, to whom it was
a place of very ·great importance. After this Philip
Sproceteded to -lay 4aft-e the country of Elis.

The Ac~heans in the mean time were very harthly u-

fed by A4pelles, who having been formerly Philip's tutor,
was in' great favour with that prince, This man intend-
ed to make the Acheans altogether dependent on the
pleafizre of Philip's miniffers. Put on the. reprefenta·
tions of Aratus, Philip commanded him to do no buti-
ness which regarded that people, except in concert with
their general. Hitherto Philip had displayed much

Mits enterprises of Philip, in order to bring his -enemy

"likhs, Lacedemonians, and Eleans, onl his hands all at
~dhcl, 'refolved to attack them by sea, to oblige them to
Bliivide their forces'. HNaving make a diefcenat on iCe-
plialolnia, an island in the lonian s~ea, -he. befeged the
cit~y ~Palea. But -by the fault of Leontius, a mith d-e-
:,iti~ed to Apelles, he was oblige'd to raise the' siege.
Ap~~jelles and Leontius, who afted ~in concert, w~ere con-
'iiiiually s~uggesting schemes to Philip, which,~ b~t 'fo~r
.tte; prudent counsels of Aratus, mulit have infailibly
-tsmined has affairs.

-Philip having returned to the -continent, -secretly

9n~arched by ai -unfrequented way through rocks to-

--jiiars Thermae, a ·confiderabjle cityr, where ~most: of the:
3I'ches of the iaEtolians were deposited, and where they
ikept their fairs. Arriving before the city, he immedi-
-at ly; attacked it,' and entering it with his army, found

anE

an imre~nfe booty. . Tlhe- Macedonians, calling to mind
the outraggeous behavioutrof the JEtolians at Dodona,
resolved to take thei- ·revenge here. They set fire
therefore to their tem-ple, and ded~troyed a great number
of their statues. Philip concluded this expedition by
a very ikilful retreat; which he efbe~ted without: any dif.
order, and with very little loss. PolyBius informs us,
that Aratus was the contriverr and the conduator of this
enterprize. That great man was sing~ular in this .refprelt,
that he could form an extraordinary plan of this k~ind,
and execute it more ikilf~ully in concert with another
general, ~than by him~self alone. The whole army be.
Ilowed .the highest applause on the conduat of this exgpel
dition, execept Leontius alone, the confident of Apelles,
and one of Philip's principal o~fficers; who was to hearti-
ly vesed at its faccef~s, that he could not reitrain himself
from breakring out into the mol insolent reproaches
against Aratus.

P~hilip departing from Leucades, arrived at Corinth,

difembarked his troops, and proceeded by the way of
Arg~os to Tegeu~m in Laconia. The Lacedemonians
were much surprised on hearing that this young prince,
whom they imagined to be at a great ditance, was in the
heart of their country. Phi-lip indeed usually accom-
plifhed his marches with such diligence, that the Greeks
were' amaz~ed at it. After ravaging Laconia, Philip
returned to Corinth. In the m~ean time, Apelles and
his son, having, by their insolent conduet, quite ex-
hauffed 'the patience of that prince, were, by his orders,
apprehended and put to death #.~

The JL~tolians, greatly errhauffed by the war, grew

at last very desirous of peace. On the other +,hand,
Philip not only prevailed on the allies to continue the
war, but after making a journey into Macedoxiia, re-
turned himself into Greece, alid laid siege to Thebes mn
Phthiotis, which· he took after a vigorous resistance.

continnei d feaeteen years.

As taft,~ however, upon tuhe rearneft folicitationrs of the

,idple of Chrios, Rihodes, and: By zantium, to· grant
.peace to the Ji~tolians, he ma~rhed with his army to
NJaupadtus, where he entered into conference with the
J~tlian deputies, and at laflt concluded a peace with
ther~ni: on condition that each party thould retain pof-
feffian of the pla~ces then in their hnds.~-- In h~i~s
year happened the famous b~attle between H~annd-
bail~ and the Romans, near the lake Thiaradimm, 7
whetre the latter were totally routed with great
slaughter.
,-The temper of Philip, in that miean time, aippeared to
be greatly altered., He gave htimflf up to every fort of
:debauchery -; treated' the c~ities· and R~ates irr* allianc~e
with him with aniIhpporta~t- dble anghtinefs ; and afiter
receiving a chek ·at A-pollonia fromn the Roma~tns, he
se~emed determined~ to ~vent hi'S r~e~e~ntment ]for that de-
feat on his confederates, by ravaging the country of
M~elfene. A-rates having remrofitrated pretty f~martlyt
'againft this. extrordintary condeft, was,' from that moi
menRt, regardted, by Phlaip as an impertinent~ conferer,
-And was barely poifened by the procuremnent of that
piiince, wTho, by this time, w~as hardened in cruele~y,-and
d~efitatedl at no crinte, however base: or d~etestable. Sucjh
was the end of this illuffriorus patriot, and fugh the~
feward received by him from Philip for the many ima-
-porant services he had readered him. The Aci~heanls
and Sicyionians contended for the honone of rtaffing a
ra·mb- to his memory; but the latter preiraile~d, on.
deeont~ of his being a native of their city. His nxr .
Ass~eral was celebraited with the highest na-gnifi.
cence, and the Sicyonians even o~ffered sacrifice~s at h~is
ttomb, as the savio~ur of their city, and the refforer of
the Aichican republic.

~- Ph'li~p: next se~ized on the city of Iffurs belonging to
.the I~yritans, and took by stratagem its citadel, which
wats- thoinght isnpregnable. The Romans, whose affairs
began nowik sto w·~ear a: better afped, by the redu~ion of
·Syracure- and' Capua, taking umbrage at the -growing~

power

powier of Philip,. formed the fchenrie of stirring up against
him .of: new the ;itoli-anrs, then accounted the mofth
powerful people of Grreece. For this purpofei Valerius
Lievinuis having: been ditfpatched in the quality of am-
baffador to the i~tolians, exhorted thern by a long
oration to enter into alliance with the Rodmans, whose
power -he highly: extolled. His -advice being seconded
and his argumnents refdrced by Sicopas one of their
chiefsthle treaty was agreed to. TIhen the JEtolians
invited se~veral other Rtates, and particularly the Spartans,
to accede to this alliance; but they were zealously op;
posed I y the AcarnanianS, w~ho, ha~ving declared for
P-hilip, -.ofed their atmott endeavours to -prevent the
Sipartans from eimbracing the confederacy.-T'hef re·
pr·elen'tat.~ions, :however, were ineffedtuali

Sparta,.wls, at this, tiste difkraaed by two fadtions,-

That of M~achanidas- h~aving 'pr~evailed~, and miade· hiar
snafter of the -city, he- declared against Philip, and ate
tacked thle A~cheans, ·who thereupon implored the pro-
teaion of that prince. - Philip came to their affilitance,,
and defeated: in tewo? engagements the JPetolians, who
were [upported by king Attalus. B~ut Ptolemy king of
Egypt,. :the.Rhodians, and Athenians, · appreh~ensive left:
Philip~ thou~ld make. a snqueft of all Greece, sent am·
bnflkdors, earneftly-fly dgliri him to make peace with the
JEtoliarns. This produced a. conference to delibera~te ·ont
the terors of peace. But the ZEtolians, insisting: on con-
ditions: more· agree~able to the situation of conquerors
than of the conquered, Philip called on the a~mbassadors
present ·to bear witness, that the 1~Etolians themselves had
fruffrated their good intentions. The conference was
there·upori broken off.

A-few. days. after, Philip beinlg joined by the Aches

ans, advanced towards the city of Elis, where the JIEto-
lians had a garpifon, and laid .wa~te the neighbou~ring
country to provoke the enemy to come- to an engage-
mnent. His operations had the desired ef]Fea. The ene-
m~y, among whom-were 4000 Romans commanded byI
the proconsul Sulpicius, attacked him, and the batdle

a w17as

vrias i very bravelyr and ~b~it~inately· fough~t. Here Philo.
poecmen, who led the--Achean -caval-ry, fkruck dead with
his lance the commander of the .2Etolian cavalry, -by
whfom he had. been attacked. Philip, feeing his, army
giving ground, threw himself into the muidft of the Ro-
man infantry. By this rath a~tion· he occasioned a.
dreadful carnage ; and it was with the utmost diffculty
that -the Macedonians disengaged and saved their king.
P~ilip, after laying wade the country, and carrying off
.4cgrea-t booty, wais obliged to march into Macedoinia to
prote £6 it against the Barbarians, who 'had lately made
a derperrate incursion into that kingdom.

N~ext year, Sulpitius and king Attalus joining: at Lem-

nos, advanced 'with their combined fleet towards Euboea,
laid siege to. Orea, and took it by the treachery of the
comlmanding officer. - Intending next to attack Cha~lcis,
they proceeded to that place ; but thinking it too well
fortified, they defite~d~ from the undertaking. Besides
its :itrong situation on the lanRd-fide, that city derived
great -security from its. lying -on the famous firait of Eu-
ripus, where the waves are always violently- agitated,
femnetimnes fromn one q~uarter, fomretimres from another,
occaffroned by an irregular current which renders the·
bay extremely unsafe for thipping. Then Attalus hdgic-
siege to Opuntum ; and, in spite of the great expd-
dit-ion made by Philip to relieve it, took it before his
ari~val.

-In the mean time M~achanlidas, tyrant of Lacedemon,
having levied a considerable army, formed a sc~heme for
making himself master of all the Peloponnese; and ad-
van~ced into the territory of Mantines. The allies, too,
w~ere ready to take the field, and Philopae~men being
chrofen general of the· Acheans; - sis embled their troops,
andA· lfter exrhorting them to second his zeal by their
o~e~dience, ardour, and courage, led them on to ac-
tio~n .

T ·~his celebrated hero is commonly called the la~fl of the

Greeks, b~ecause it is observed, that after him Greece
pro~dued no leading man worthy of her former glory,

As he will thak~e: a cnfiderable figure in thre se~quel, it
may rb oft be imrpeid ere brie~fly-todayujr before the rea~-

der he mft iftingilhing partiedlars of his charac~er.

Philopoemen was is native of Megalopo~lis, a cityT of Ar-
cadia. He had received -an excellent education,. havting
been carefully infkruc~ed in the phil~fopohty of ArrcefI-
laus, ch~iefly calculated to inspire men with a spirit of'
patriotifur, and ·-to preprare them:f~or state employments.
-Phioponeme had earl~fy proposed- Epaminandas for his
x nodel. - ·From· his infancy he thbw~ed. a ftroting: propen-
fity for_ war,. ditcovering-~ a pecuiar: fondnes~s for men
diflinguifhed by their military exzploits, and for all war.
like: ~exercises. As soon as- he was able to bear arms,
he entered hbimelf- among the -troops eufually sent into
Laconia to pi-llage. Druring the intervals of le-isure, he:
asppliedhimfelf to the ex9ercises proper for Rleengthening
the body, foch as hunting· and agric~fultue, o~ften hold-
ing -thei plough witbh his own hanids. For, in those- times,
the· most polite nationu ser ~the lhigheft value-on tillag~e,
and the greatest· men employed themflelves in the manual
labour requisite in ~husbandry.

.Phi~loptemnen took great deighit likewis~e in the fludyt
of· ph~ilosop~hy, -and in peruding the poems of Homer
and the life o ~Alexan~der, wThich furnis~hed him with the
nroft aniimating lessons of bravery. - H~e applied himself
particutlarly to trhe- fled~y of t~ati~cks~, or the art of draw-
ing up an grmy in battle order; and he often amuired
himself with putt~din h-is pre~epts ~in praEdbi~ce~ o all the
varieties of ground through which he -happened to9 pass
with- his -troops*,; When Cleomenes king of Sparta at-
tacked Megalopolis, ·Philofgaemenn~ Agni~aifed his- courage
very hi~ghly in the def~ence of that 'his -native country.
He· likewise d~iftinguilhedd himself at the baittle of Sela-
fi~a, After th~ati h~e wue~nt ·to ~r~ete; an filand then a-
bounding with men. ikilful in the art of war ;· anrd having
there completed hris education in the military art, he re-
turned into his -n~ative ·country, and was soon after cho-
fTen general of the AcEhean c~avalry.

As soon as he received, the co~mmand, he applied

z ~hilmfelf

'himfelf to r~efiore a ftr~ift difci~pine among the soldiers,
employing for that purpose earnest remonltrances, and,
Swhen there failed, severe chaft~ilemrnent. HEe accuffomed
the young men to all the exercis~es of war ; rendered
them expert at the neceffagry military evolutions; and,
by diffributing prizes among those who made the greatest
profaiciency, he kept up among them a [pirit of diligence
and emulation. At: the battle of Elis, menti~oned above,
he gave a signal proof both of his valourr and mil~itary
aEkilL Ar~atus had~ rais~ed the Achean repunbic to that
Spitch of powuer at which it then stood. Philopemen
was d~e~ined to make them soldiers. He introduced
great alterations in the a~rmou~r used by the troops,
which he made heavier than it was before. H~e taught
them a new method of fighting ; and: accuffomed them
to close engagements.

He c~onsid~erably refkrained the lauxuy and exp~ensive

turn of his fellow-citizens, in poin~t of equipages and
d~refe. But finding it impossible to reform them al-toge.
ther, he endea~voured to dire~t their taste to the ob~jeats
mokt worthy of men generally exposed to war, namely,
to the purchase of fine hors~es, elegant arms, helmets
adt2orned~ with- beautiful fe~iathers, and ebro~~ridered coats
of mai~l; hoping, by these means, to heighten their va-
lour and love of arms. In this Caei'ar followjed his exi
amnple. As for himsel~f, he. carried his simplicity, in
point of dress, so far, that he appeared to be nothing
less than the general of an army. Plutarch tells us,
that Philepaemen happening one day to arrive alone at
thre house of a friend, by whorn he had been invited to
dimirer, the miffrefs of the house, though the knew of
his commng, was to far from imagining that a person in.
his dress was the general of the Ach-eans, that the mif-
took him for a servant, and begged the favour of him
to assist~ in d~oing fonte affairs in the kitchen-, because
her: hdb3and wa~s from home. Philopaernen very readily
granted her requ~est; and laying aside his cloak, fell to
cleaving wood. The husband arriving in the mean
tfime, cried out in amazement, Ca How, my Lord Phi-

JC k "L lopoemen,

CS lopaemen, what means thisl' ?" " m only paying
"' (anfwkered he) the penalty for my poor appearance.'"

Philoppemen, after visiting the cities, levying troops,

and makuxg the necefIary preparations for war, affem-
bled his army at Mantinrea, and gave -battle to Macha.
nidas. T~he charge was exrtremely violent; and the
fate of the battle remained long doubtful. Both parties
fought hand to hand with great obitinacy. The right
wmng of the Achean army at last giving way, Machani-
das pushed his advantage. 1While he was intent, how-
ever, on pursuing those that: fled, Philopaemnen flkilfully
took poi-ffefon of the post relinquithed by Machanidas
gave a different turn to the engagement, charged the
enemy on their return from the purfiuit, and put theus
to flight. Perceiving, at the fame time, Machanidas
jumping a ditch, with an intention to make his escape,
he aims his javelin at him, and firikes him dead in the
ditch. The conquerors, after cutting off his head,
purs~ued the remainder of his army all the way to the
city of Tegeum, which they took by assault. In this
battle the loss of the Lacedemonians amountedi to more
than 4000 men, while that of the Acheans was very in-
considerable. The latter, fenfble that they owed this
viAory entirely to the Ikill of their general, credked a
itatue of bra~ss to his· honour.

At the N~emean games, which were celebrated soon

after, Philope~emen happening to enter the theatre, fol-
lowed by the young men who composed his phalanx,
jufl: as the musician Pyla~des was singing. to his lyre the
following lines of an old poet,

"C Th~e pal'm of liberty for Greece I won,"

the audience immediately looked at Phi~lopaemen, and
gave a great: thout.

Sparta, in the mean time, groaned beneath the yoke

of a more cruel tyrant still than Mlachanidas, namely,
Nabis; who, besides the other vices commnon to all ty-
rants, was aatuated by a violent ipirit of avarice, which
prompted him to torture and to baniih the richer fort of

citiaens, that he might seize upon their wealth. To
maintain himself in his tyranny, he took into his pay a
large body of foreign soldiers, capable of every fort
of mischief; by whose help he put to death all those
whom he fufpea~ed to be his enemies.

Nabis having received from Philip king of Macedon

the city of Argos, in pledge for some money wherewith
he had s~upplied that prince, there pra~tifed the most
thocking cruelty. Having invented a machine in the
form of a flatue resembling his wife, the breast, arms,
and hands of which were fluck full of pegs of liron, and
covered with magnificent garments, when any perfobn
refused him money, he used to tell him, that though he
himself was unable to persuade him to comply with his
requeit, he hoped his wife Apega might have more ·in-
fluence with him. Being accordingly introduced' to the
pretended Apega, Nabis took her by the -hand, and
brought her up to the man, whom the immediately em-
braced very violently. The man finding himself all
over pierced with the pegs of iron, uttered the most
frightful Lhrieks; and to procure deliverance from such
exrquifite torture, readily ·granted whatever Nabis in~ift-
ed uporn.

The JEtolians finding themnfelves negleated by the Ro-

mans, who were then totally employed by a much more
important war, made their peace with Philip ; and the
people of Epirus having followed their example, tran-
quiity was for a time reltored to the allies.

Philip having soon after declared war against the Rho-

dians and King Attalus, laid siege to Pergamus, the cal-
pital city of the dominions of Attalus. But failing in1
his attempt, he vented his resentment, by burning the
temples, and breaking to pieces the ftamues that ca~me in
his way. After this he was defeated by At'taluis and
the Rhodians, near the island of Chios. Growing daily
more and more hardened against misfortunes, he pro-
fecuted the war with more fury and cruelty than before.
Having t-akers Cias, a city of Bithynia, he made slaves
of most of the inhab~itants, and put to death the reft,

K ka after

after torturing them in the most dreadful manner. The
cities of Thrace, and the Chersonese, thereupon f~urren-
dered without making any resist~ance.

But Ab~ydos, a city situated on the narroweRt part of

the Hellespont, called in modern times the firait of the
~Dardanelles,· resolved to Rtand a siege. Philip according-
ly laid flege to it in form; but was at first vigorously
repulsed by the inhabitants. Finding his efforts from
the sea ineffeaual, he changed his position, and attack.
ed it by land. The besieged, finding that the Macedo~-
nians had sap~ped the wall, and were pushing forward
their mines very fast, sent to treat with Philip about a
s~urrender. But as he in~ifted on their surrendering at
diferetion, they resolved rather to die sword in hand;
and, with that .view, chose out fifty of the oldest citi-
zens, to whom they gave orders, that as soon as the
M~acedonians entered the town, they thoulfd, in the first
place, murder all their women and children in -the
temple of Diana; then s~et fire to certain galleries con-
taining the public effeats; and, laitly, throw all their
gold anld silver into the sea. The fifty citizens having
bound themnfelves to the performance of there particu-
lars by the: most fol~ems oaths, ~the reft of the men pro-
ceeded to the breach, where they fought with the most
desperate bravery till the night put an end to the flaugh-
ter. Next day two of the oold citizens, who had fwrorn
to the performance of the particulars above mentioned,
shocked at the idea of so dreadful a duty, chose rather
to betray the city to Philip; who, ruthing in, beheld
with horror the inhabitants cutting the throats of their
wives and children, and endeavoured in vain to prevent
the frightful carnage; for ·the members of each family
mutually killed one another.

Philip, whose 'turbulent difpolition did not permit:

him to remamn a moment quiet, enterng' Attxca, com-
mitted great devaffations;, and thereby obliged the A-
thenians to complain at Rome. The Romans had long
been displeased with thle behaviour of Philip; and.de~i-
red nothing more earnest~ly than a plausible pretence for

. comiag

coming to an open rupture with* him. The senate,
therefore, dispatched Valerius Levious with a ~fleet to
Macedonia, that he might be at hand to s~upport their
allies: and soon after the departure of Levinus, they
made a solemn declaration of war against Philip. In the
mean time the M~acedonians marched towards Athens,
with an intention to besiege that city; but found the A-
thenians in battle array without the walls. The Mace-
donians immediately attacked them very vigorously,
and drove them into the city. But not thinking it ad-
vifable to enter the city along with them, they wrecked
their resentment: on the country around, which they laid
waite with fire and Cword.

About this time the 1Etolians hesitate~d whether they

oughtr to declare for Philip -or for the Romans. But
ebe former having been so~on after defeated in an en-
gagement by the latter, they immediately took part
with the Rlomans.

In the mean time a Roman. fleet, joined by that of

Kfing Attalus, failed towards Athens, and entered Pi-
reus. The Athenians were so exceedingly elevated at
this event, which relieve~d them from their dread of the
Macedonians, that they overturned the statues erefled
by them to Philip a little while before, and abolished
the sacrifices they had established in honour of that
prince.--So easily did this fickle people pass from one
extreme to another.

The BEtolians having declared in favour of the Ro.

mans, Phbilip had an interview with the Ro-man procon-
ful Flaminius. But as they· could come to no agreement,
Philip prepared for war. Nabis still continued his ty-
ranny at Argos, firipping the wealthy of their money,
and torturing those who were fufpe~ted to have conceal-
ed anly of their e~fefts. Having intimated. to Flaminius
and Attalus,. that he was master of Argos, and desirous
of entering into an alliance with the Romans, he was
accordingly received as an ally. Flaminius and Attalus
then proceeding to Thebes, pers~uaded the Boeotians to
join the confederacy liksewife. King Attalus died thort-

IE k 3 y

ly after at Pergamus. The vast riches of this prince are
much celebrated in hiffory; and great prair~es are be-
flowed on him for the excellent purposes to which he ap-
pie~d his wealth, as well as for the singular juffice exer-
cifed by hi~m towards his fubjeas. In a word, this king·
as represented as a perfeAt model of a good forereign.

I 7King Philip and Quintius (surnamed Flaminzius)
'97 came at last to an engagement in Theifaly, near

certain mountains called Cynaocephala-, the army of each
amnounting to about 25,000 men. Here the Romlans
gained a complete vi~tory over Philip, who loft r 3,000~
men in the battle, of whom 8000d were krilled andt the
reft made prifoirers; while the loss of the Romans was
no more than 7oo. In this engagement, the unevenuefs
of the ground prevented the ~1Macedonian phalanx from
aaing with its usual advantage. The iEtolian cavalry
contributed greatly to the obtaining of the viAory. Bi-
sustaining the impetu~ous charge of the Macedonians,
they prevented the Romans from being pushed into the
open valley, where the phalanx could have a~ted with
greater vigour. After this defeat Philip sued for peace,
referrmng the terms entirely to the pleafore of the Roman
senate. Till that thould be known Quintius granted a
truce for four months to Philip, on receiving from hint
4too talents of moneyT, and his son Demetriuls as an hofi~
tage.,

Ten commiflioners, named by the senate for settlings

the terms of peace with Philip, arriving at length in
G~reece, preferibed to him the following conditions:
That all the. Greek cities, both in Europe and in Asia,
thoulld be declared free, and be permitted to govern
themselves by their own laws : That Philip should with-
draw all his garrisons from the Greek cities at preient
under his power ; thlould deliver up to the Romans all
prisoners and deserters ; should pay them 1 ooo talents of
·money at certain terms; and that his son Demetrius
thould be fTent an hostage to Rome. Thus ended the
IV~acedon-ian war.

Ats the Greeks were ignorant of the import of the

termrs

terms of peace granted to Philip, and talked veryr dif-
~ferently about them, * uintius resolved to reserve the
p ublication of the moltt important article, refpeding
.their liberty, till the Isthmian games, which were on
the point of being celebrated, and at which an infinite
number of fpe~ators, from all the different Rtates,
would be asse~mbled. In the init~ant, therefore, that
the whole fpedators were drawn up in the Rtadiumn to
fee the games, a herald appeared, and proclaiming si-
lence, read aloud a proclamation to the following pur-
pore. "C The senate and people of Rome, and T. Quini
CL tius their general, having conquered Philip ndthe
"C Macedonians, deliver from all garrisons and impofi-
"C tions, the Corinthians, Locrians, Phoceans, Euboe-
"C ans, Acheans, Mi~agnefians, T~heffalians, and Perhe-
"C bians; declare there Rtates free, and to be f~ubje6t
(C only to their pwn laws and ufages."

TFhe fpedtators were seized with such an excess of

joy on hearing this decree, -that, doubting whether
their s~enses had not deceived them, they desired the ·he-
rald to read the proclamation again, that they might be
certain about its real meaning. The decree being ac-
cordingly read a se~cond time, was listened to with the
most profound silence; and when the reading was si-
nithed, nothing was to be heard but the most violent
thouts of joy and applause.

As soon as the games were concluded, the whole as-

fembly, regarding the Roman general as their deliverer,
ran about to thank him, endeavouring to kiss his hands,
or to cover him with garlands of flowers. Quintius
tasted in that day the purest and highest pleafurge which
the mind of man can enjoy ; a pleasure far s~uperior to
any that can be attained by the most magnificent
warlike triumph ; becaule it proceeded from an
a~ion of goodnels, humanity, juffice ; from the
consc~iousness of~conferring on men the- most real hap-
pinefis whereof they are in this life ~susceptible. The
different slates, unable to restrain the sentiments of gra-
titude that glowed weithin their breasts, exclaimed to

K ~k 4 one

eone aziother, "L WhTat a wonderful nation this I which,
"C at its own exlpence and hazard, undertakes wars to

Q~uietiu~s caused the fame decree to be again proclaim-

ed at the Nemnean games; and afterwards made a tour
through the principal cities, every where reforming, by
the wisest regulations, abules in the government and
courts of juffice ; recalling such citizens as lived in ba-
nifhment, and putting an end to all inteffine fallions and
divisions. This condui~t ferred not only to raise very
high the glory of the Ro~mans, but contributed greatly
to the increase of their influence. The nations around,
feeing the excellent purpoles to which they applied their
power, - vied with one another in testifying their confi-
dence: in the equity and good faith of that people, and
even desired to receive magiffrates from them, under
the name of praetors. It is proper here to remark, that
the ~LEtolians, naturally a· refilers nation, were nowY
while all their neighbours gratefully enjoyed the fruits
of peace, the only people who showed any discontent
againit the Romans; boasting, that they could have Aub-
dued Philip without the affiiance of the Romans.

The Romans, unwilling that Argos alone thould groan

under the oppreffin of Nabis tyrant of Sparta, while
the other states lived in perfe~t liberty, gave orders to

~auintius to declare war ag~ainst Nabis. That general
accordingly,- after declaring war, marched direAly to
Sparta, which Nabis had firongly fo~rtified, and where
he had ihtit himself up with I 6,000 men, after purtuing

to death all the principal citizens, whom he sus-

I 95. peaerd of dif~affe~ion. Nabis mak~ing'~a sally wyith

his foreign troops upon the camp of Quintsus,

which was pitched on the banks of the Eurotas, at sirs

cr:1eat ed

created some disorder among the Romans. But the Ro-
mans quickly rallying, beat the enemy back into the
town. .Nextt day Nabis attacked the Romans again ;
but after a very obitinate engagement, his men were put
to fl~ight with great slaughter. The brother of ·the Ro-
snan general having in the mean time taken poffeflon
of Githium, Nabis, very uneasy at the loss of that place,
which was of great importance to him, demanded a con-
ference with Qu~intius. But they could come to no a-
greement. In a f~cond conference, Nabis confeiated to
relinquish Argos, and to deliver up fach of the: Romans
as he had made prisoners. But Q~uintius insisting, that
he thould likewise deliver up all prisoners and deserters
from the maritime cities under the Roman power; that'
he thould pay roo talents of silver, and give his son as
hoffage for his future good biehav-iour, Nabis re~fused to
agree to peace on thes~e terms. Quintius thereupon
calling in all his detachments, prosecuted the siege most
vigorously, investing it on all sides with an army of
50,00~0 men. As Sparta was fortified with a wall on
the most acceilible places only, Nabis found himself un-
der very great embarrafinment; for being pushed on all
sides, he knew not to what quarter he ought to fend as~-
fiftance. T~he Lacediemonians for some time sustained
the efforts of the Romans, but when the foremolt
ranks had penetrated into the large itheets, unable to
keep their ground any longer, they were obliged to give
way. Nabis, to avoid the imminent danger, ordered
the houses next the wall to be set on fire. The R~oman
soldiers, who had got into the middle of the city, terri-
fied by the flames, hastened to join the main body of
their army;~ by which means Quintius, after being in a
manner master of the city, was obliged to found the re-
treat. But the attack having been renewed next day,
Nabis applied once more for peace; and was obliged
to accept of the conditions which he had formerly refu-
fed. After concluding this peace, Quntinus difmittfed
Eumnenes king ofPerg~amus, who had afihfted him at
the siege; and then set out for A~rgos, where he was

present.

present at the Nemean games, and diffributed the prizes
to the vit6ors. His presence in their city gave the
highest joy to the Argives.

The Acheans, in the mean time, and the JEtorlians,

grumbled much at the peace concluded with Nabis;
being diffatisfied that foch a tyrant thould be permitted
to rpmain in Greece. Q~intius, after spending the win-
ter in visiting the chie f town s of Greece, and every
where re-efiablithing juffice and good order, the real
blessings of peace, went ·to Corinth, where, calling to-
gether deputies from all the Rtates, he explained to
themn what the Roman people had done for -the liberty
of Greece; and told,them, that peace had been g~ranted
to Nabis - solely from their earnest: de fire to preserve
Sparta from utter ruin, which must have been the ine-
vitable consequence of driving him to extremity. Then
having exhorted them to live in union with one ano-
ther, he embarked for Italy, and entered Rome in tri.
umph.

The JEtolians, the only people of G~reece who bhar-

boured recret malice against the Romans, were now
very induffrious in flirring up enemies against them.
F~or this purpose they applied to Nabis, who being but
too well disposed to follow their seditious counsel, found
means to bring over to his fide the principal inhabitants
in the maritime towns, of which the Romnans had obli-
ged him to relinqulfh the poffeffion, prevailed on seve~ral
of them to revolt, and laid siege to Gitium. The Ro-
mans, hearing that Nabis hbad broken the peace, imme-
diately dis~patched the praetor Acilius with a fleet to
Greece.

The Acheans hating Nabis, resolved to oppose him,

and made Philopaemen their general, who at first wRas
defeated in a battle at s~ea; but quickly repaired his
loQfs. Attacking: the tyrant near Sparta, he cut in pieces
the greatest part of his army, gained a complete vi~tory,
and besieged him in that city. The JiEtolians; about
this time ferit an embassy to Antiochus king of Syria,
to, perfoade him to undertake' an expedition into

Grrece,

Greece. The Romans, getting notice of the pradices
of the· ltolians, desired the-Athenians to put: them in
mind of the alliance which they had lately entered into.
But the J~tolians liste-ning to their resentment alolle,
formed a plan for getting; poffefiron by fi~ratagem of De-
Inetriades, Chalcis, and Sparta, and' committed the ex-
ecution of this plan to three of their principal citizens.
Diocles su~cceeded in the design upon Demetriades;
Thos failed in that against Chalcis; but Alexamenes
was somewhat more fixecefsful at Sparta. Having en-
tered that city with I ooo men, under pretence of afif~t-
ing Nabis, he was joyfully received by the tyrant. But
drawing him aside, as if to communicate fornething to
him in private, he suddenly pulled him from his hors~e,
and then gave the fignalgrdonthsateatswo

rdhng orard klle 1abis on the-fpot. Then

they fell to pillaging his treasures. ,The Spartans sp s.
arming in the mean time, attacked the iiEtolians,
and cut most of them off, together with their leader A-
lexamenes. Philopaemen, hearing of this confusion at
Sparta, quickly entered that city with a body of troops ;,
and calling an assembly, pers~uaded the Spartans to join
the Achean league. By this flep Philopaemen acquired
great honour : and he dis~played fingullar disinterested-
ness by reffiGng a present fTent him by the Spartans
of 1 20 talents, arising from the sale of the effeats of
NJabis.

Antiochus having, by the persuasion of the 1Etolians,

entered Greece, was defeated nears the pass of Thermo-
pylas by the Rioman cons~ul Manius Acilius. After
this viatory the cons~ul intimated to the BEtolians, that:
it was not yet too late for them to have recourse to the
Roman- clemency, and to avoid the chastisement due to
their repeated of fences ; for that they might purchase
their pardon, by putting their capital Heraclea into the
hands of the Romans. These remonfirances proving
ineffeaual, the consul proceeded to lay siege to that
city in form. As it was large and well fortified, the
pefieg~ed made an obstinate defence, and fought with

the

the most delperate bravery. But Manius having given
a general assault about three o'clocle in the morning,
while the .1Etolians, wearied with fatigue, lay buried in
sleep, carried the city, and gave it up to be pillaged.
Mlany of the inhabitants fled to the citadel, but: were at
last obliged by famine to surrender. The reft of the
nation having that themselves up in Naupaaus, were
pursued thither by the consul, who laid close siege to
that city, and in two months reduced the enemy to the
last extremity. The ABtolians, now on the point of
perithing under the Roman power, made the humblest
fupplications to the consul Qlintius to pity their mi-
fery, and to interpof'e in their behalf. ~Quintius com-
pafi~onating their diffrefs, prevailed with Manius to
grant them a truce, during which they might have an
opportunity to makre their f~ubmiflions to the senate at
Ro me.

The A~tolians hearing ifoon after that Antiochus was

rotally defeated by the Romans in the battle of Magne-
fi~a, and finding themselves unable to resist any longer,
implicitly submitted to the conditions preferibed them
by the s~enate; of which the principal article was, that
they thould deliver up their armns and horse~s to the Ro-
mans, and pay them 1oao talents of silver.

Those Spartans who had been banished from their

country by Nabis, having taken poffeilion of som~e places
on the coast, thence made incursions into the Lacede-
monian territories. By way of repritals, the latter at-
tacked and toole poffefiron of LaLs, one of the places oc-
cupied by those refugees; who thereupon having ap-
plied to the Acheans for relief, prevailed with them to
interpolfe in the affair. The Acheans, under pretence
of the Romans having put under their proteaion all the
towns on that coast, requrired the Spartans to deliver up
the authors of the enterprise agai-nst Las. This demand
threw the Spartans into foch a fury·, that they killed
thirty of thos~e who were most intimately conne~ed with
Philopoemen, renounced their alliance with the A-
cheans, and sent ~ambass~adors to the consul Fulvius, to

beg

Sbeg of the Romans to take Sparta under their protec-
tion. The Acheans being informed of this, were in
their turn highly (off~ended, and declared war againit
the Spartans. The dispute was referred to the decision
of the Roman senate; both parties were heard, and a de-
ciilon was pronounc~ed in very ambiguous terms, which,
however, the Acheans pretended to interpret izi their
own favour.

Philopoemi~en therefore putting himself at the head

of an army, ardvanced to Sparta, and fixmmoned the in-
habitants to deliver up to him the authors of the enter·-
prise against Las. The principal inhabitants ~having
gone out to make an answer to this demand, were fu-
rioufly set upon by the refugees who happened to be in
Philopoemen's army, and s~eventeen of them were Ilain
and next: day, fixty-three more of them were condemned
to death by this exasperated multitude. Then the A-
cheans proceeded .to treat Sparta like a city taken by
force, commanding the walls to be pulled down, the
foreign soldiers to be sent out of Laconia, and the laws
of Lycurgus to be totally abolished. Every particular
was executed accordingly, to the inexpressible grief of
the Spartans, who sent complaints to Rome against Phi-
lopoemen; in consequence whereof Lepidus wrote a let-
ter to the Acheans, severely reprimanding them for their
unnlawful proceedinrgs. The senate difiapproved, in the
firongeft terms, of the rigorous conduft of the Acheans,
and cited them to make their defence at Rome. They
endeavoured to juffify themselves ; but the s~enate pro-
nounced s~entence in favour of the Lacedemonians, or-
daining, that those who had been banished by the A-
cheans thould be recalled and reffored to their estates;
that all the proceedings relating to that affair thould be
annulled ; that the walls of Sparta thould be rebuilt by
the Acheans ; and that it tlhould remain united with the
Achean confederacy.

About this time, the Meffenians having, by the per-

suasion of Dinocrates, renounced the Achean league,
tefolved to take poffedfion of Coronas, an important post.

Of this resolution Philopoeme~n getting not-ice, took the
field, though then feventyr y-ears of age;, and advanced
towards M~effend'. An engagement ensuing, Philopae-
men in the beginning of it repulsed the enemy. But

a firong reinforcement arriving to the aid of the

183. Meffenians, the Achean troops were defeated,and

Philsopemen, after performing extraordinary feats

of valour, was grievously woun~ded, thrown from his
horse, taken prisoner, condulted to Meifend In chains,
imprisoned, and by the advice of Dinocrates cruelly
put to death by poison. Philopoemen received the cup
without making the least complaint, drank off the poi-
son, and expired a few moments after. The Acheans,
penetrated with grief on receiving this news, immedi-
ately took arms, with a resolution to revenge his death;
and marching into the territory of Meffend', made a
dreadful ravage. The Meifenians, unable to resist the
torrent, begged for peace in the humblest manner. The
Acheans inf~ited on their delivering up the authors of
Philopoemen's death ; and the MZeffenians agreed to the
condition. But Dinocrates prevented his punishment
by killing himself. The other persons concerned in that~
cruel affair weike stoned to death around the tomb of
Philopcemen. The Acheans performed the most mag-
nificent funeral obsequies to the memory of their brave
general, and carried his ashes to Megalopolis. The
prrocefironrerfembled that of a triumph; the horse and
foot knarched under arms, and the inhabitants of the
towns through which they passed came out to meet the
procession.

This year was rendered remarkable by the deaths of

three of the most famous commanders in antiquity, Han-
~fiibal, Scipio ~Africanus, and Philopaemen.

The Roman senate began now to take umbrage at the

power and credit of the Achean league; and to behold
with a jealous eye the ability of their generals, the
valour of their troops, the perfeft union that f~ubfifti-
ed among their cities, and the entire liberty in wbxch
they lived. In this difpolition the Romans, with a vie3

·of humbling them, never failed to give a favourable
hearing to the enemies of the league; and some of its
unworthy members, fach as Callicrates, who hurt them
considerably in the affair of the Spartan refugees, were
constantly furnithing pretences to the Romans for curb-
ing the republic. But it was not till after the defeat of
Perseus, the last formidable enemy to the Roman power,
that the senate resolved to difolve the league, and to re-
duce the Acheans entirely under their power.

W~ith this ,view, the Romans induffrionfly applied

themselves to weaken them, by fomenting divisions a*
mon13g ~themn, and by committing all the important of~fices
of the republic to men totally devoted to their ·pleas~ure s
who by that means poffeffred the balance of power in
their affemnblies. Public officers having been by the
Reomans dispatched into Asia, to take information a-
gainft all those who had supported Perseus, received
from Callicrates, a man wholly in the interest of Rome,
a lift of fach of the Ahcheans as he fuf~pedted to have fa-
voured the cause of that king. Upon this information,
no fewer than looo of the most considerable citizens rin
the Achean republic were seized; and the Acheans
were ordered to cornduat them to Rome.----What a de-
tes~table instance of tyranny! -Trhe celebrated hiffo-
tian Polybius was one of this number. On arriving at
Rome, they were diffributed through the different coun-
tries of Italy, without so much as being heard in their own
defence. T~he Acheans compaffionating the fate of their
fellow-citizens, sent s~everal· di~fferent embassies to Rome,
intreating the senate to take cognizance of the accufa-
·tion against those citizens who had never been brought
to trial at home. But all their remonftrances were in-
effeaual, though s~uccessively renewed from time to
timre for the space of seventee~n years. At last, how-
ever, the ifenate cod~ented to the restoration of those=
exiles to their native country. But during to long sa
mnterval, so many of them had died, that of the rooo
who had come into Italy, only 300 returned to Greece.

Some years after, great disturbances broke out in A.

chaia,

chaia, by the indEiferetion of their principal magistrates:

one of whom, named Demrcritus, declared war a-

x47. gainRt Sparta, and entering Laconkia with an ar.

my laid waste the country. The Romans sent com-

mniffioners to terminate this dis~pute, who proceeding to
Corinth conduated matters at firit with great modera-
tion; for Carthage not being yet taken, the Romans
chose to manage tenderly such powerful allies as the A-
cheans. Thris behaviour, however, served only to make
the fa~tious Acheans more unruly ; and: their chief Cri-
tolaus potted from city to city, exasperating his country-
rnen against the Romanls, and endeavouring to prevent
any agreement from being concluded with the Lacede-
momnans.

It mult be acknowledged, th-at at this time the Ache-

ans were far from behaving to the Romans with that
caution and prudence that they ought. On the contrary,
they seemed to be doing every thing to excite their re-
f~eatment. Metellus, who was then in Macedonia, hear-
ing of these diffurbances, sent four Romans o-f confider-
ation to Corinth, to exhort the Acheans not to draw on
themselves the vengeauce of his countrymen. But
their remonfirances were deriided, and they themnfelves
were driven out of the city. T~he Corinthians, on this
occasion, particularly diftingulfhed themselves by their
animosity against the Romans. Critolaus in the mean
time laboured to perfiuade his countrymen to make war
on the Lacedemonians ; publicly bo~asting, that he would
make head against the whole Roman power, and that
he had engaged kings on his fide. His endeavours were
fuccefsful; and he even found means to prevail on the
Bccotians and the people of Chalcis to join the confe-
deracy. These states seemed at present to be a~tuated
by a spirit of folly, which was hurrying them on to their
rum.,

The R~omans, informed of ther~ie tranfations in

G3reece, ordered IMummius to make war on the Ache-
ans. Metellus, who was on the s~pot, once more sent
them an embaffy~j, acquainting them, that the Romana

3 people

People might yet be prevailed upon to forget their past
behaviour, provided they would return to their duty,
anad cionfent to certain cities being difunitect fromn the
iconfe~deracy. Th~ere pr'opofals were: rejeaed in to dif-
dainful a. manner, that M~etelltas was provoked at it.
i~mmediately5 therefore, marching against: them with his
Many, he obtained a c~omplete .viaory, and todk more
tha~bn Iboo prisoners. In this engagemrent Crito~lauis dif-
appeared ; and it was commonly believed that he was
d.row~ned in a rnarth as he was endeaLvouring to makej
his escape. Diaenus therefore, another man of a.fa~t~ious
tarbulenat spirit, ass~umed the command, levied forces
from all quarters, and rn~uffered up an army of about
t4,000 men. Metellus ,in the mean time pursued the .
rebels; and having fallen in with Iooo Arcadianls, put
them all to the· sword. He then marched against
Thebes j but the inhabitants, terrified at the fame of
the Roman viatories, abandoned the city. T S~he advan-
cing towards Corinth, where Dianus had that himself up,
he dispatched three of the mast considerable persons of
the Achearn republic to perfunde their countrymen to as
void ere it was too late their impending ruin. Buit the
mulntitude favouring the faaion of Dianus, threw those
citiz~ens into prison.

Things were in this situation when ]M~ummius arrived.

1Wetellus then returned into Mkr~cedonia. Mumntiius
immediately affemnbled his troops, and formed his camp.
Th~e beliieged made a sally, attacked the Romansi and
killed many of them. This inconsiderable advantage
proved their ruin. Diaeusj elated by his s~uccess, was
mad en~ough to offer battle to the consul; who, to in-
crease his pres~umption, declined the engagement, as if
throug~h fear. The Acheans, deceived by this firatagem,
advanced with the most foolish confidence against the!
Romans; who at last marched out to meet thern, and
gave them battle nearly about the narroweit place of the
isthmus. The Acheans, at the fame time that they were
engaging the Roman legions, finding thems~elves char-
ged from an ambulcade by all the conf~ul's cavalry, were
mna moment overpowered and put to flight. DZiaeus in

L l de.

derpair hurrying to Meg alopolis his native - city, killed
his wife, set fire to his hoofe, and drank poison. The
Acheans, now without a leader, had not the courage to
rally, but fled on all sides. Most of t~he inhabitants re-
tired from Corinth in the night. M~ummius entering the
city, gave it up to be pillaged ; put to the iiword all the
men that remained in it; fold the women and children for
slaves; and after taking away the fineit flatutes and pic.
tures, set fire to the houses, reduced the whole city to athes,

and razed the walls to the foundations. Thus

i46. pediihed Corinth the fame year that Carthage was

taken and destroyed. The Romans demolished

the walls of all the cities that had taken part in the revolt.

The ruin of Corinth made so terrible an imrpreffion

on the Acheans, that their courage entirely deserted
them. The senate pretended, that they had treated the
Corinthians thus s~everely, on account of their having
VIoplated the law of nations, by abusing the ambaffa.
dors sent them from Rome. But the truth is, that the
Romans, not choosing that any slate thould be able to re-
f ift dieir power, resolved to destroy Corinth, whol~e very
strong and advantageous situation rendered it a most
convenient ho~ld for any of their enemies ; who, with
proper skill and resolution, might there baffle for a long
while the whole Roman power. The Roma~ns drew im-
mense riches from the s·poils of this city. Among the
piaures found in it, there was one reprelenting Bac-
chus, executed by the celebrated Aristides. This piece;
was reckoned infini~tely superior to all the reft, and was
ordered to be given to Attatus for about g 200 1. Ster-
lingf. But Mummius thinking it a matter of dangerous
excample to fell a pidture at foch an extravagant price,
ref~used in spite of the complaints of APttalus to deliver
it, and sent it to Rom-e, not indeed for his own private
use, but as a public ornament. It was accordingly pla-
ced in the temiple of Ceres. That illuffrious Roman
gave upon this occasion a firiking proof of his difinte-
reftednlefs, integrity, and great knowledge in the art of
war; but at the farne timle he fhowredd himlfelf to be mni-

x fe~rably

ierably deficient in point of taite for the fine arts; for
we are told by Velleius Paterculus, that to make those
employed in the tranfportsition of the Corinthian flatues
and piltures to Rome more than ordinarily carefrl· about
so precious a trUss, he threatened, that if any of thern
were spoiled or amiifng, he would oblige the bearets to
to furnish others at their own expence.

After this memorable period, th-e Romanis sent cott-

miironers into Greece, who abolished in all the slate~s
the Popular form of government, and created magl-
itrates dependent on the Roman commonwealth. But
in other refpetts the Greeks were left in the fulll enjoy*
rinent of their lawts and liberty; Att last, however,
Greece was reduced into the form of a Roman provmece,
and was governed by a prastor sent thither annually.
Thenceforth, therefore, it bore the name of thre provcince
of Achaia; the Acheans being in those latter times thie
moit powerful people in Greece.

As Athens has all along made the moist confx-

derable figure in the hiftery of Gree'ce, we wilvl, I46.
before concluiding, briefly take notice of the most
remarkable misfojrtune experienced by that city a~fter
the Romans madte themifelves m~asters of Greece.

Michridates king of Pontus, having subdued all Affa

1Vinor, dispatched into Greece an army of I 2 ozoo
Inen under Archelaus ; who by means of so great a
force soon reduced Athenrs, and obliged the other slates
of Greece to falbmit to M~ithridates. Archelaus fixing
his residence at Athens, poflifeffd himself of all authort-
ty, and exercised a cruel tyranny over the inhabitants.
Their miseries, however, undter this new master, were
but flight in comparison of those they were soon to un-
dergo. The celebrated Sylla being charged with the conduQt
of the war against Mlithridates, passed over into Greece
with five legions. All the citiesi excep~t Athens, imme-
diately on his arr-ival opened their gates to him. The
Athenians were not at liberty to follow thieir own inchr-
nations. The tyrant Ariftion, under whole3 yoke they

Ll 12 then

then groianed, was daring enough to oppose the Roman
troops, and to sustain a siege againit Sylla. That ge-
neral. immediately invefied· Pircus where Ariftion
had taken post; and though the walls were sixty feet
high and very firong, Sylla attacked them with the
greatest vigour ; employing for that purpole a vast
number oflengines, and neither regarding danger nor
expence. Being in want of wood, he cut down the
trees of thie L~yceum which formed soiot: beautiful and
delicious walks ; and to supply himnfelf with money, he
plundered the treasures of the temples of Delphos and
Epidauru m.

If the attack was desperate, the defence was no less

so. Both parties behaved with the greatest courage and
resolution. Every day produced new atfaults and new
sallies, in which a vast deal of blood was ifpilt. The A-.
thenians dis~played on this occasion all the admired intre-
pidity of their anceffors. They burnt part of the Ro-
man machines, anrd overturned others by means of mines
which they carried under the ·spots whereon they flood.
The Romans animated by Sylla discovered no les~s ar-
dou~r. On their fide they employed mines likewis~e, and
thereby threwr down a considerable part of the wall.
Having thus made a large breach, they immediately
gave an assault, but after a long and desperate dispute
were retpulfed. The Athenians during the ensuing
night that up the breach by a new wall.

Sylla was beginning to ~des~pair of fuceefs, when an

idea itruck him of reducing the city by famine. Con-
verting therefore the siege into a blockade, he soon
brought every horror of famine upon the miserable A*
thenians; who, after· devouring all the herbage, roots,
and the fleih of their horses, were obliged to eat the
leather of their thoes. Some of them are even reported .
to have had recourse to the shocking expedient of eatisig
human fleth. ·Finding themselves at last under an absolute
necessity of capitulating, the people and senators, by the
anoft earnett folicitations, prevailed on Ariftion to fend
deputics to obtain the beit terms they could from Sylla- -But

But thos~e deputies, instead of faing in the humble manner
Sthat became people in their situation, having entered in,
to a pompous defeription of the exploits of the ancient
Athenians, were interrupted by the haughty Roman,
who calling them in derision preachers, and desiring
them to reserve their fine rhetorical flourishes for them*
selves, iriformed them, that he hall not come thither to
learn the heroic adtions of their anceffors, but to chaf-
tife them for their rebellion; and he difmiffe'd them
without further ceremony.

Sylla getting intelligence Soon after from his spies, of

a part of the· wall low enough to be sealed, gave orders
to fix ladders there the following night. The Romans
by these means made themselves matters of the city,
and put all -they met to the sword. T~he carnage was
dreadful, few of the miserable inE-abitants having efca-
ped. Sylla gave up the city to be plundered ; and then
proceeded to inveit the citadel, which was fGoo foTCCA
to surrender for want of provisions. Ariftion some time
after wnas put to death. Sylla having next made 87
himself matter of Pircus, demolished its forti- 7
fications, anid burnt to the ground the arsenal, a build-
ing much admired for its elegant architeature.

Sylla, after beating the generals of Mlithridates in two

great engagements at Cheronea and Orchomene, re-
duced iMacedonia and Greece under the Roman power
in the fame manner as they had been formerly. Then
pafirng over into Asia Mlinor, he conquered lonia and
Sfeveral other provinces, whereof Mithridates had .taken
poffef~ion in that country.
'Greece, by becoming a Roman province, did not
lose that ardent desire of liberty which was always its
principal charaderiffic. In the Roman civil wars be-
tween Caes~ar and Pompey, the Athenians wrarmly em-
braced the fide of the latter, which appeared to be
founded on republican principles; and after the death
of Julius Caesar, they erekked Rtatues to the memory of
Ca~iTus, whbo had been the most adive of the conf~pira-
tors-againRt Caesar. Ll 3 Greece,

Grce,· though firipped of her political power, still

preserved her sovereignty in the sciences and fine arts;
and, in that refpe~t, received homnage from her very
conquerors. The molt illuffrious men among the Ro.
znans repaired thither to be inftrur~ted in the most va.
luable branches of literature. Athens, therefore, ~that
nurse~ry of learning and of kcience, Htill remained the
central pomnt in the republic of letters, and contiinued
to be frequented by all who desired to acquire that atti-
Cilk Co highly valued by the ancie3,nts, and that standard
tasse which enabled them to eftim-iate, with peculiar ac-
curacy, the real beauties of every work of genius or art.
Hjere too, and here ozily, were to be learnt the true
principles of eloquence. All therefore wkho applied
themfbilves fuccefsfully to public speaking, and Cicero
in particula'r, repaired to Athens to fludy under -the
a~blest matrters of oratory. Thither did the fame Cicero
fend his son to hear the le~tures of Cratippus ; every
R~oman of any rank or consideration followed the fame
course; and Greek learning, according to the testimony
of Plutarch, was accounted so requisite a branch of e.
ducation among that judicious people, that a R~oman
wvho did not understand the Grteekr language, never ar-
rived at any high degree of: eftimationi.

Such odf the emperors as had a talte for the sciences,

Titus Antoninuls, M~arcus Aurelius, Lucius Veruis, and
some others, used every means to entice to their court
the most diftingulfhed philosophers of Greece, not only to
enjoy their con~versation themfeclves, but that they might
dirct~t the education of their children. Even in the ~de-
cline of the Rioman empire, and during the fourth and
fifth ages of Christianity, Greece still continued to be
the resort of the ph'ilof~ophers of all nations. We fee,
from ecclefa~icaftca history, that St Basil, St Gregory,
and StChryfo~tom, those: bright luminaries of the
church, went to A9thens to imbibe, at the source, the
rnoft important branches of knowledge. It is remark-
a'ole too, that a few detached beams from the setting fun
o~f G~recian genius lighted up the dawn of learning and

of science in W~effern Europe, after it had remained for
se-veral centuries involved in the deepelt. gloom of Go-
thick ignorance. This propitious event was the confe-
quence of an apparently heavy calamity, namely, the sack-
ing of Constantinople by M~ahomet II. about the middle
of the I~th century. By that revolution many emmrent.
philosophers and artists having been induced to abandon
their hative country, fettled in Italy, where' they reffo-
red the knowledge of the sc~iences and fine art~s. And it:
will reflea immortal honour on the takte and munifi-
.cence of the truly noble house of M~edicis, - that, to the
princely encouragement afforded by them to those
learned and ingenious emigrants, Europe is chiefly in-b
debted for the revival of polite literature.

Besides Athens, s~everal other cities were famous,for

being the residence of the arts and sciences, s~uch as A-
lexandria, Byzantium, Rhodes, and Ephesus.

Panatius, the Stoic philosopher, . was descended of

one of the most ~illuffrious families in Rhodes; but his
love of knowledge induced him to reside at Athens,
where he attached himself to the Stoic Ichool, then ve-
ry much in fashion. The fame of his knowledge soon
.reached Rome, where the greatest men then applied
themselves to the fludy ·of philosophy. Panaetius was
drawn thither by the invitation of some of the most il-
luffrious Romans, and formed a very intimate friend-
thip with Leelius and Scipio; the latter of whom ho-
noured him with marks of the greatest: confidence, and
prevailed with him to accompany him in his expeditions.
Panaetiuis composed a treatis~e on the moral duties of
mankind, highly valued by Cicero, who made muchh
.use of it in composing his Ofi'ces.

Epi~leturs, a native of Hieropolis, a city in ]Phrygia,

was likewise a follower of the Stoic s~ea. Hfe was equal-.
ly famous for the sublimity of his -sentiments and for
the purity of his morals; in which last refpeat, the Stoics,
slotwithfianding their exrterior ~severity, and their rigid

to his echolar Arrian. . Nothing except Christianity it.
[~elf can be more pure and fyblimne than the do~trines of
his philosophy. The celebrated Monsieur Pas~cal, who

fkr-a~t of it with a diftin £6efs and precision worthy to
great a genius. As this piece is curious and focrce, we
Oziall here pre~sent the reader with the substance of it.

Epietetus., says he, is one of the few philosophers

who had the juffeft notions of the duties of human life.
Hes desires, above all things, that God Almighty may
bfe constantly the chief objeat of our consideration ; that
we be thoroughly perfe~aded of his perfeft juffice, and
cheerfully submit to all his difpenfations, from an entire
conviftifon of his infinite wisdom. He assures us, that
this difpolition will .prevent all murmurings and com-l
plaints, and enable us to bear with patience the most
painful accidents of life 4 evrer fay, "C I ave loft such
t' a th~ing;"' fay rather, "C I have restored it :" IMy son
dies, "' 1 have reffored him;" MZ~y wife dies, "C I have
" given her back;" and so of every other poffeflion =
While the Almighty indulges you in the use of it, be
careful of it, as being the property of another. Yocr
must~ never desire that things thould be stifpofed accor*
ding to your fancy or pleasure; but be always as~sured
that they happen for the belt ; Conltantly regard your-
self as being in this world a kind of player, who must
perbrorns Cllch a part as it pleases your master to allot

appear rich or poor as your chiara~er requires, and err.
deavour to play your ~part as well as pofIible; but still
remember, that to ;assign the part is the busines~s of your
maniter s RefledZ daily on death, and the.moft lamentable
aniferies of life ; this will preserve you rom' thinking
basely, and from desiring any thing -too earnestly, He
proceeds to point out how a manl ought to behave on
anany different occasions. He advises him to be humblei
and roodeft ; to conceal his good resolutions, and to
accomplikh them privately ; because nothing diminithes
their value to much as ostentation : He repeats again
and again, and constantly endeavours to enforce this
maxim, "L That the whole desire, the whole fludy -of
"5 man, ihould be to discover the will of God, and to
** follow it.")

De~metrius P~halereuls has been already mentioned as

chief magiffrate of Athens. It only remains to fay a
-few words of him here as an orator. He was the fcho-
lar of Theophrastus, from whom he learned a florid and
bighly ornamented ityle. He excelled in that species of
eloquence which employs the graces of declamation and
beautiful thining exspreilions, but is devoid of solidity
and vigour. Being, however, much applauded for the
pleasure he gave the ear and imagination, he had a great
number of imitators. It is for this reason· that he is
raid to have contributed greatly to the decline and cor-
ruption of eloquence at Athens. To please was the
·whole aim of the oratory of Demetrius ; which, there-.
fore, was better adapted to amuse· the fancy than to
convince the understanding.

To the number of Greekr orators may perhaps be

added .several fathers of the church; such as, Saint Ba-
fi~l, Saint Gre~gory, and Saints Chryffo/iom, whose writings
contain a beauty of flyle, a solidity of reasoning, and a
vehemence of expreiffion, well calculated for touching the
heart and moving the passions.

Polybius, the famous hifter-ian, was a native of IVega-

lopolis. Hte learned eloquence and philosoph~y under
hiy own father Lycortas, a man greatly diftinguiihed for

for the filrmnefs with which he s~upported the interests
of the Aichean republic against the ambitious designs of
the Romans. Philopcemen was his master in the art of
war. ·His merit was known at Rome, where many of
the principal citizens cultivate'd his acquaintance; and
particularly the two sons of Paulus .1Emilius ; of whom
the youngest, the son by adoption of Cornelius Scipio
the son of the great Africanus, and- the defitroyer of
Numantia and Carthage, profited much by his infiruc-
tion s.

Polybius is believed to have compose the greatest

part of his hiiffory at Rome. This hiffory c25qtaned not
only the Roman tranf~a~ions, but those of all· the then
known world, from the firtR Punic war to the ruin of
the kingdom of Macedonia, comprehending altogether
a space of fifty-three years. Polybius therefore called
it an univer-sal hiffory, and divid~ed' it into forty books;
of which only the five first now remain. The loss of the
reft is very much to be regretted; for we thould have
found there a repres~entation of the grandest and moil
interesting scenes ever displayed on the theatre of the
world. There we thould have seen, particularly mn the
period of the second Punic ·war, the two most warlike
and 'powserfud nations then in the world, engaged in the
most s~erious and i'mportant contest:; Rome on the very
brink of deftwuAion; and Carthage finally vanqurfhed
and undone. There, too, we thould have found an
account of the wars of the Romans with Philip Kmgnl or
1VIacledon, with Antiochus K~ing of Sy ria, with the 1E-
tolians, and with K~ing Perseus; in a word, the great:
chain of events that conduaed Rome to the utmoia
pitch of powNer, and enabled her to; [wallow up all the
slates and kingdoms in our hemisphere. This loss is so
much the greater, that Polybius bestowed the utmost
care, attention, and induffry, to procure the best infor-
mationn with refpeff to faats. That he might ·not be
mistaken about the situation of places, he himfielf travel-
led to the spots where the principal engagemlents deferi-
bed by him happened. Besides all this, Polybbiou~s

Wonds with~ the juffeft refle~tions; and every where
bdlivers the m-ost solid -maxims of policy ; two particu-
lars that constitute the chief· excellence of evetry hifto-
rian, ari'd fromn which a reader derives the most valuablez-
idt~iruation It is true, that his digrefirons are generally
tedi~ous; but the fatas they contain are to curious, that
it~wer~e rigorous to find fault with-them.

Prolybjus ~having returned into the Peloponnele after

the deffruation of Corinth, had an opportunity of de-
sending the memory of his malter Philopoemen from an
accusation of his having becen an enemy of ·the :Roman
peop~le. He acquitted hin, self on that occasion with such
eloquence and force of arg'u~mcent, that a decree: was paL--
f~ed, forbidding the statues s~er up in honour of that he-
ro to be demolished or hurt. Poly bius was like wife
_shofen by the Romaan commnithen~c-rs to visit~ the con-
quered towns, and to fettle any disputes that had aris~en
among them. This commifia~n he executed with such
ad~mirable prudence and equity, that Itar nes were, in
·different p'laces, ere~ted to his honour. After th~is he:
went back to Scipio at Rome, with whom he lived till
the death of that illuffrious Rom~an, when he on-ce more
returned to his native country, and there ended his days
.at the agfe of 82 years.

Dionys/ius the Hq~icarnacfan was, as his narne i mports,

a native of Hahicgrnaffus, a exty of Caria in Asia Mi-
nor. He came futo Italy about ·the time~ of the battle
of A~tium gaindd by A~uguitas ag;ainst A5ntony., His
principal work, intitled, ' The Roman 14Anigustire, was
divided into twenty books, of which only cleven now
remain, and comprehended the most abftrule part of
the Roman history, which it deduced fr-om -the found-
ing of Rome. Diuring th~e- residence of Dionyflus at:
Rome, he formed an acquainta'nce with the most learn-
ed men then in that city, and studied very carefully the
works of the most eficemed hiflorians. ~The learned
d~iscover in Dionyflus a profound erudition, a most a-
cute spirit of criticism, a mind void of prejudice, and.
3rPa ardent love of truth. 17Ve are particularly obliged

to him for the knowledge: he has given us of the religion
and manners of the Romans. HMis flyle is simple and
elegant; and he appears more solicitous about showing
his learning than about the ornaments of eloquence.

Diodorus6 Siculusc lived in the time of Julius Cat~far and

Augustus. His work, intitled, T~he Hiflorical Library,
comprehended forty books, of· which only~ fifteen now
remain. The five first immediately follow one another,
contain the hiftery of the fabulous times, and treat of
what happened previous to the siege of, Troy. The next
seven books comprehend the hiffory of the Persians and
Greeks, from the extpedition of Blerxes into Greece
till the death of Alexander. And the three last give
us the hiffory of AlexIander's f~ucceifors. Diodorus is
a very valuable hifterian; .and though he appears to
have given rather too much credit to the traditions of
the priests, yet we have great reason to regret the loss
of the reffof his biflory. His flyle unites fimpicity
with perspicuity, and his works abound with judicious
refleQSions.

Pitutarch, the celebrated briagrapher, was a native

of pheronea in Boeotia, and lived in the reign of the
emptror Nero. He performed several journeys into
Italy, to colleEU materials for his Li-ves of- Illuffirioucs
.1Ven;j and he numbered amsong his friends the greatest
men of Romne, who took delight in hearing him reason
In Greek on matters of philosophy. At last he fixed
his const~ant residence in his native country, where he
was honoured with the first employments,- and difchar-
g~ed thole, as well as all the dutiesr of private life, with
admirable care and prudence ; thowing himself to be a.
good father, a good huitband, a good master, and a
good citizen; and his virtue was rewarded with the
tweeteft harmony ~and peace in his family.

His works are, his LiYLs of Ill~Cufiriou MPen, and

his DiScou~rse nz Aorals. The last contain very ofe-
ful maxims for the condu~t of life, sublime nonions a-
bout the divinity and immortality of the foul, and are

a in-

iinterfperfed throughout with curious anecdotes. But
the liTe'as of llufi~rioucs men is the wlrork that has immor.
talized the name of Plutarch. It is looked upon as the
·noft proper book in, the world, to form men either for
private life or for public employments; and it abounds
with particulars highly worthy obs~ervation. Things
are there estimated at their real value. He does not
confine himself to the great and thining ailkions alone
of the illuffrious men whos~e lives he wTrites :- " He does
iC not satisfy himfelf," says M. Rollin, "L to paint the
'L commander, the conqueror, the politician, the ma-

~Cgift rate, the orator ; he introduces his reader into
=C the closets, as it were, or rather indeed into the hearts
" of those of whom he s~peaks; and there makes him
C' acquainted with the father, the husband, the makler,
aC the friend. WTe seem to live and to converse with
'. them, and to be present at their parties of pleasure,
C 'their walks, their feasts, their conversations. Cicero
CL somewhere observes, that in walking through A-
CC thens, and the places adjacent, one could hardly ad-
"C vance a fiep without meeting with some ancient mo-
*C numlent mentioned in hiffory, which recalled to the
"C imagination the remembrance of some great man of
"C antiquity, and rendered him in a manner present.--
"C The reeading of Plutarch's Lives,"' continues MrRollin,
" produces a similar effelt, presenting, as it were, be.
"' fore our eyes, the great men of whom he speaks, and
"L giving us an idea of their behaviour and manners, as
"C lively and firong as if we were living and conversing
CC with them."

For th~is reason, the loSs of Some of those: lives is the

more to be regretted.-·-Plutarch appears, on all oc~-
cations, to be a great painter ; and his flyle, though
,plain and simple, is nevertheless lively and expreiffive
but not every where equally s~upported. -Plutarch is
ceofured for his fondness of flory-telling ; and indeed,
provided a flory be curious, he never fails to introduce
it, and to give a minute detail of it, however remote its

con-

connedi~on rnay be with the fubjeat in hand. But his
refle~tions arbe always sensible and pertinent. Wre are
indebted to him for having preserve·d to us specimens of
the writings of some of his great men.

Befiides the eminent historians here taken notice of,

several others of the fame country flourithed in the times
of the emperors; such as Arri8an, Alian, Appian, and
fl-1erodEiaLn; but thes~e were of an inferior rankr to those
mentioned above.

ANCIEN GREECE

Conztaining a faccinI Ac~coun~t of the prinacipal~ Irans-

a~ionts int the ~land of SICIz.Y.

SICILY is situa~ted in the M~editerranean sea to the

the Strait of Meflina, about two miles and a halforer.

It is about 17o miles long and Ioo broad, and of a

triangular form, the three angles being terminated by
as many rernarkable capes,' namely, Pachinum # to the
south, Pelorum -j- to the north, and Lilybeum ( to the
wkeft.,

ALs it lies between thirty-feven and thirty-nine degrees

of northern latitude, its climate is warm; and it is
healthfut----From remotest antiquity down to these~ times
Sicily has been always regarded as one of the most fruit-
ful spots in the world, producing corn, wine, oil, and
silk, particularly the firit, in extraordinary abundance.
It was called the granary of ancient Rome, and with ju-
slice; as that great capital of the weffern world, when

in the jeenithi of its powei, glor'y, and population, de-'
pended chieflyi o~ix this island for its A~pplies of corts.

The climatli the fertility, and the beauty of Sicilyd

conspire to iender it one of the most delicious couintries
on earth. But it is thbjeEU: to one dreadful calamity,
which proves an alloy to all its excellnces5 namely, a
frequency of earthquakes. These are s~upposed, and
with much probabilityg to be principally occasioned byi
the convulflons which from the earliest tradition down
to our days, .have been constantly agitating, though
with very different degrees of -violence, the whole iflandb
but more especially the bowels of M~oUnt 1Etna. This
mountain is of very great extent, being nearly twelve~
Imiles firom the commPen~~~frcmen of itS asc~ent to its fum-
mit, and it is one of the largest volcanos· in the virorld.
I~ts eruptions are accompanied by s~evere ear thquakes,
by which the whole island is violently thaken. Many
towns, with great numbers of the inhabitants, have by
these: earthquakes been at different periods friallowed8
up and destroyed. In the r693 above fifty towns are
said to have been reduced to ruins, and more than·
a So,ooo persons to have periihed.

The more ancient hiffory of Sicily is obscure and pere

Iplexed. Its fruitfulnefs, and its advantageous situation
nearly in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, from
whence the navigation to the Greek islands, and to the
richest diffrifts of Europe, of Asi~a Minor, and of Africa,
was~ thort and eafyj, natu~rally invited thither many ad·
vehnturers in commerce. Colonies of Phenicians, of Car,
thaginians, of Greeks, and of Italians, found means to
procure establishments there, and built citiese

These cities became as many indeperident Rtates. B~ut

their re~fpeative forms of government seem to have been
extremely flufuating ; fometimnes displaying the faubli-
meft heroilm and virtue, but oftener diffrafted by the
folly and fury of republicanism; and frequently groan-
ing under the cruel opprefiron of a parcel of petty

tyrants. The Carthaginians in particular appear to have ac-

qluxted

qruired an early footing, and to have colonidect many
~considerable territories in Sicily. That commiercial
people, fully sensible of the importance of this island,
at length aspired at the forereignty of the whole coun-
try. In this pursuit they prefifted for many years
skith various fixecefs, and at an immense e~Itpence of
blood and treasure : but at last they were:entirely ex-
pelled by the Romams, their rivals and their mortal
enemiies.

The first Greeks that passed ovier ihto Sicily were the

Chalcidians of Eubm~a, wRho founded Leontium and Ca-
tena. After them, Archiats the Corinthian led a colony
into that island, and became the founder of the city of
Syracule about the year before Christ 709. Much a-
'bout- the fame time the foundations of Megara were
aidd by the Megareans.

In like manner, several Greek colonies fettled in the

fauthern parts of Italy, comnmonly known by the name
ocf Calabria;- which increating dailyg and being joined
by maniy additional colonies of Greeks, grew at last to
confidierable, that the country obtained the name of
Gsreater Greece.

There colonies, imitating the example, and a~uated

by the ifpirit of the parent Rtates in Proper G~reece, frorn
whence they had emigrated, appear to have prefertred
themfrelves in a slate of independence.. None of them
therefore ever arrived at any eminent degree of power
or territory by the faubje~tion of their neighbours. 'They
a-re chiefly noted in hiffory for ·luxury and voluptuobid-
rrefs of manners.

Syracute was the: most powerful city in Sifcily. Hi-

itory, however, has tranfinitted no memorable circumr-
iftance regarding it during the two first centuries of its
exifatence. It only began to mak~e a figure in the time
of K~ing G-elon. But, for the space of 2 co years after
that period, it gave occasion to many interesting events.
Of these we (hja~ll here confine outlelves to the most
considerab~le.

IVI m Abouit

About the year before Christ 484, the Carthaginians,

at the initigation of Xerxes the famous king of Peria,
invaded Sicily with an army of 300,ooo men and a fleet
of 2000 thips a but this formidable army was defeated
by Gelon, then tyrant of' Syracuse.

This Gelon deserves to be ranked am~ong the greateit

men. He ivas a native of Gela, a city on the southern
coast of Sicily. Upon the death of Hypocrates, tyrant
of that place, Gelo took arms against his fellow-citizens,
s~ubdued· them, -and 'poffeFfed himself of the forereign
;iuthority. Shortly after, he effeted a li~milar revolution
at Syracuse ; whe're, after ·secur~ing himnfelf in -the fu-
preme authority, he direated his attention to extend the
territory of the city, ~and ,soon: became very powerful.
Hamilcar, the Carthagainian ·general, having. laid siege
to the city of Himera, G~elon went to the afifitance of
his father-in-law, who defe~nded that plade; and the fa-
Ither and son joining their forces, gave battle to the Car-
thaginians, gained a complete vi~tory, and made an im.
snenfe booty. rGelon employed the greatest part of the
Sdpoil to decorate thle temples-of Syracule; he divided
the prisoners with the greatest equity; and, assembling:
thle Syraculans, gave them a full accoulnt of his pro-.
Eeedings. -By there means, he acquired their esteem
and affeation to fach a degree, that they voluntarily be-
flowed on him the title of Ii~ng, ** He was the firit
"C (~ayIs M. Rollin) whom the regal dignity rendered a
"C better man.'' Hiitorians are full of the praises of
Gelon's vir-tues. They celebrate particularly his since-
rity, his exact observance of his promises and engfage-
ments, and his careful attention to promote ag~riculture.
He thought himse~lf bound, as king, to defend the in-
taerefts of the itate, to enforce juffice, and to prote~t
innocence. He embellished and fortified the city, and
increased its territory. He never made his power to be
.felt, exicept in doing good.; and persisting in the
fame moderation to the end of his life, he died uni-
verfally regretted by his fubjefts, after a reign of seven
year~s.

Hiero ,

Rierb, one of Gelon's sons, succeeded him; butd

$roved at sirs a kiing of a vecry dit~erent charaEer, in-
uniging himself in all his passions, .and giving a looke t6
violence and injuft~ide. His fa~bjeats, t herefore, rega rd -
ed him as a tyrant. * But being, by his -delicate slate of
health, exposed to frequent indifpolitionsi he gavte way
on such occasions to refleaion;i resolved, at last, to
change his co~ndu& ; and, with that view, ·invited to his
court S~imonides and Pindar, the molt famous poets of
his timei who, by the charms of their poetry and coni
verfation, softened, in a great medfure, his -fierce and
:gloomy disposition, and inspired him with more re-
fined notions of government as well as of the condult
of private life. Xenophon has taken oceation, fromi
this circumitance, to compoi-e a treatise on that im-
portant fubjea, which he has intitled Hiers. He drawk.
it up, in the form of a dialogue between that ~prmnce
and Simonides. Hiero is ·there introduced to- main-~
-taina, that kings and tyrants a~reg on mnany accounts,
far from being so happy as is commonly imaginled 4
rbut partic~ularly, by their beiing almost necessarily de-
-prived of thne greatest happiners of life, namely, a true
friend. Simonides, on the other fide, is mlade to de.
fbribe, in a very masterly manner, the duties of royatlty;
and his whole argument tends to dem~onitaste, 'that
.a king ought not to be accounted foch for :his own
fake, but for that of his fubjeats. Hiero, -duking the
remaining part of his life, endeavoured, ·by the~ mi-ldest
.a~nd inoft engaging behaviour, to draw to his court the
finest geninfes of his time. He died after at reign of
celeven years.

.Thrafybulus his brother succee-ded him, and·

proved a downright tyrant. His haughty and 47 2.
cruel behaviour provoked his f~ubjeats to rebel a-
~gainft him, and to beliege: him in his palaces Thrafy-
bulus was obliged to capitulate ; and to save lus
life, having codiented to go into exile, he reti- 46b I+
red into the country of the Locrians. The Sy-
racufans having thus recovered their liberty, ere~ted a

61I ms coloffail

nual fefhrvall in commemoration of their deliverance, and
re-established the popular form of government.

Diodorus Siculus mentions, as ha~vin~g flourithed a,

bout: this time, one Deucetius, who was chief of the
people properly called Sicilians. This Deucetius, as-
ter continuing for some time very powerful, and gain-
mng great, advantages over the Syracuf~ans, built a fa-
mous temple called Palici, which was made an invio-~
lable asylum for all who were oppressed by a Tuperior
power. At last, however, Deucetius's good fortune
abandon~ed-him. He was utterly ruined by the loss of a
single battle with the Syracufans, and thereupon his
remainibng troops deser~ted. Doubtful of his fate, he
boldly appeared in the market-place of Syracure, and
threw hims~elf on the mercy of his enemies; who, moved
with pity, and thinking it ungenerous and)· inhumane
to take. .adfv-anltae of his .present misfortunes, not only
gRave barn his . ife, but assigned him a handfame sub-
f ill enc e.

S~yracule, after enjoying her. liberty for more thans

fifty years, was, about the year before Christ 416, at-
tacked Ay the arms of the Athenians, i~ncited to that
war; by the ambition of Alcibiades. We have already
given a ftili account of the- particsulars of this expedition,

-By- rte a~bdication of Thrafybulus, Sy~racute

had: now remnained about sixty years in the poiffef- 4c6.
sion of her -liberty, whe~n Dionyflus, a private
camien, formed the design of enslaving his country, and
of assuming the s~ove~reign power. This man had ·already
given proofs of his couragfe in a war ag~ainst the Cartha-
gmnians, who had, for whole ages, meditated the reduc-
tion of this island, and had often -made attempts, during
that period, to accomplish their design.

The frui-tfulnefs of S~icily, the wealth of its inhabi-

tants, and the beauty of its cities, were to many allure-
atents to the Carthatginian avarice and ambition ; and,

detwithftanding the unfbrtunate event of most: of their
invasions of it, they Rteadily persisted in their resolution
to su~bdue it. Besides Syracuse, the city of Agrigen-
tum was famous for its magnificent temple, dedicated
to Olympian Jove, and for the riches of its extizens.
To give us an idea of the wealth of those citizens,
hi~tory takes notice of one .of them called GCellias,
who had in his houle large appartments for the re-
ception and entertainmrent of all firangers who came to
the city, and wardrobes full of every fort of cloaths for
the accommodation of such of his guests as had occasion
for them. This city, therefore, had particularly at-
trafted the avarice of the Carthaginians, who besieged
it with so powerful an army, that they at last got pof-
f'efiron of it.

It was about this time that Dionyflus conceived the

design of enflavingf his native city Syracuife. Wubh that
view, he availed himself of the complaints of the other
.Rates o~f Sicily against the Syracufan magiffrates; and
as he poffeffed, in an eminent degree, the ialent of
eloquence, so ofeful and so dangerous mna republican
government, he flood up in the midit of the assembly
of the people, and made an artful speech, calculated
to render odious the principal mnagiffrates, whom he
aIdvifed the people to depole. In vain was he declared
a mover of sedition, and condemned to pay ~a severe
fine. Encouraged by~ fveral citizens, he pushed his'
accusation, spoke with more freedo-m than before, anti
gave a most affe~ling defeription of the miseries wh~lich
the negligence of the Syracufan magiffrates to fend
timely succours, had brought upon the inhabitants of
~Agrigentum, wlho were forced to desert their city by
night, and to fly with their wives and children. The
Syracufans immediately depoferd thos~e magiff rates, and
elefied Dionyflus chief magiffratp in their place.

This first faccefs increased hisL hopes : And as an

ururper never berthates to pralkife every art, .however
cr-iminal, to effe £ his designs, he nexct applied hurn-

IV-m 3 s~elf

·ielf to supplant the generals of the army, and employed
for that purpose~ every species of fr~and and deceit. He
told the people, that, instead of making use of foreign
troops, it was much more natural and safe to truss their
defence to their owri countrymen ; and for that pur.
,pole to recall fach of them as were living in exile. This
advice was the more attentively listened to, as the Sy-
raculans were then alarmed at the conqueits of the C~ar-
thaginians. But the intention of Dionyflus, in propo-
sing this measure, was to create to himself so many ad-
hterents of those exiles, who would by that means owe
their refforation to him, and would therefore be in.
clined from .gratitude to support his interests. The
people assented to his arguments, and ordere~d the exiles
to be recalled. *·

Soon after, the SyracufaBns being applied to for aift.

ance by the inhabitants of Gela, sent Dionyflus to their
relief ; who s~erved them with foch zeal and effedt, ·that
they beffowed on him the highest: marks of gratitude
and attachment. On returning to Syracuse, ·1Dionyflus
counterfeited the appearance of a man overwhelmed by
diff refs and afflaion ; and at last informed the people,
that he~ had made a dit~covery of a treasonable corre-
fpondence between their generals and Himnilco, com-
mander of the Carthaginians. This pretended discovery
created in the minds of the people the utmost anxiety
. and confIernation. Many cried out, that Dionytius
ought to be immediately created commanaer in chief,
as the danger appeared to admit of no ~delay. The mul-
tude, accordingly, ever blind to caus~es and confe-
quences, and ·only rcegardful' of the prefrent, instantly
chose him ;command~er in chief, with absolute power,
thioughr many of the most prudent and wisest citizens
were of opinion, that by such a flep they would in effe~t
give away their liberty.

'Dionyflus, fully determined to secure himself in his

powe~r, and to render ineffeatual any change of the
public difpolition, proj~eaed another artifice for per-
tigaging his countrymen to appoint him guards. Going ther~eo

therefore to the city ~Leontium, where there was a
Syracufan garrison, certain persons employed for that
purpole created a tumult. Dionyflus cried out, that
trhere was a conspiracy ag~ainst his life, and af~fe £1ed to fly
for safety to the citadel, which he had g~arrisoned with
soldiers firmly attached to his interests. An affiembly
. of the people being called, D3ionyfieus- deferibed to them
in a moRt affe~ting manner the dang~er he; had run, and
intreated them to permit him to choose a guard of 60s
men for the feculrity of his person. His requett was.
granted; and, inficad of 600, he chose Iooo fioldiers,
by wajr of lifeguard ; whom, as well as his foreign
troops, he engaged to his service by thle most liberal
promises. He then sent to Gela for a part of the gar*
rifon, and assembled the fugitives and exiles. Thus re-
inforced, the inhabitants of Syraczufe` were no ·longer
able to resist him. IVaking therefore his public entry
~into the city, followed by all his retinue, he at length
threw off the maik, and thowed his countrymen that
;obedience now was their only s~afety. Every heart was
thereopon seized with terror, and Dionyflus saw himself
matter of the most powerfill city of Sicily.

The beginnings of his reign, however, were not free

from diflurbance, and his ambition was very nigh cost-
ing him his head. Dionyflus had marched to the re-
lief of Gela, which was belfieged by the Carthaginians.
But finding himself unable to oppos~e the enemy, he or-
cdered the inhabitants to abandon the city in the night,
and accompanied them, to cover their retreat. In this
march he narrowly escaped being cut off by some of the
Syracufan horsemen, who made a, desperate attack upon
him for that purpose; but, lucktily for the tyrant, were
Cepulf~ed. The danger, however, did not end there.
Tlhof~e horsemen, on being disappointed in their first de-
sign, rode forwards to the city, attacked Dionyflus's
palace, plundered it, and abuied his wife. But things
soon· assumed a different appearance. Dionysius push-
ing on to Syracule in the night with an escort of 500
men, defeated and cut in pieces a body of the citiziena

Mm n 4 who

who attempted to oppose his entry, In revenge put to
the jfwOrd all that carne in his way, and gav-e up the
fiollfes of his enemies to be plundered.

The full extenst of his treason soon became ap-

1404. parent. His countrymen? perceived, that, to sup.

port his aforpation, he had concluded an alliance

wIith the Cathaginians, wkho inrtimated: to them by a he-
rald, thait if they had a mind to obtain a peace, their
city u~Rn remain fubj~et -to the power .of DIbonyfins.
T-he tyvrant h~aving· no~w gotten the beter of all oppoli,
ti~on, inflifted on the Syracufans all the horrors and mi·-
series of tyranny. Seniib~le of their hatred, and of the
danger wrhi~ch conitantly threatened his life, he resolved
to sacrifice to his safety every person wuho gave him the
least unealinefs. Studying to inzfpire terror by the pu-
nifhments wnh~ich he daily inaflidted:, he beheaded some ci-
tizens, -burnt others, and satiated his cruelty by put-
ting to d~eath pe~rsons of every age and of every condi-
tion. On this oexation Plutarch observes, that such
emuet tyranpts are from time to time set ovrer nations by
she unerring difrpofition of the~ Almightyr Creator, to
scourge them for their wickedness and impie~ty.

Dionyflus, after intimijdating the Syriacufans into sub-

jeftion by his cruelty, began to take other meafores for
his future s~ecurity, and applied himself particularly to
fo-rtify that part of the city called the island, which,
in cafe of necefi~ty, might ferve' him for a place of re-
fuge. Then he turned his thoughts to the subduing of
such of the inhabitants of Sicily as Ctill remained fr~ee q
and for that purpose resolved to besiege the city H~erbe-
fina.. But this projecTt had almost proved fatal to him..
The SyracufCan ·troo~ps, whtim he had armed with a view
of makling use of their afif~itance in this undertakcing,
finding thems~elves in a condition to vindicate the liber-
ty of their country, revolted from the tyrant, besieged
him in the Epipol-is, and set a price on his head. Here-
PPOn Dionyflus, being likewise deserted by his foreign
auxiliaries, thought himfPEf ablolutely undone; and to
avsroid falingii into the hands of~ his enemies, conceived

'' the

the design of putting an end to his life. But from this
desperate reforlution he was diifiuaded by one of his
friends. D~ionyflus therefore intretated permission of
the Syracufans to depart from the city with his fa-
mily; which they were not only simple enough to
grSant, but likewise complied with another request of
.th tyrant, to furnith him with five vesi~es wherein to
transport his e~FeCts.

Wi~hile preparations were makring for the departure of

Dionyflus, the Syraculans, apprehensive ,of` n~o further
diflurbancle from him, gave thems~elves up to ant indo-
lent security ; of which the tyrant taking advantage,
warmly solicited the Carthaginian garrisons irn the towns
adjacent to come to his relief. The Carthaginians re-
solved to support him-y and r 200 of them marching to
wards Syracuse, overpowered all: oppothiion, and eff~e&-
ed their jun £kion with Dionyflus. This sudden reverse
oJf fortune discouraged the Syracuf~ans; and Dionyflus
having made-a sally on the besiegers, and cut off a great
anrmber of them, obliged the s~urvivors to rajife the siege,
and to d~ispers~e. Finding himself now superior to his
onemies, he sent word to those who had fled, that they
might peaceably return to the city, for he frankly for-
gave what had passed. Perceiving, however, that the
Syracufans were not to be truffed, he thought it ne-
ceffary to employ every precaution for his safety,
aod therefore he took the opportunity of the enfu~-
ing harvest to seize on all their arms. Then he fit-
ted out a powerful fleet, enlisted a great number of so-
reign troops, and resolved to attempt s~ome enterprise~
that might increase his power. For this indeed he pof-
fed all the requisite courage and ability. He quickly
reduced Naxus, Catana, and ~Leontium, and chastised
some of the neighbouring cities which had attempt~ed to
appose his progress.

Dionyflus having now formed the defiign of ruining

the Carthaginian power in Sicily, began to make vast
preparations for putting his design inr execution. In
the frirt plage he enticed to Qyra3cuf, by the means o

great encouragement, a mailtitude of woprkmen, skilful
in preparing every thing necess~ary for a powerful arma-
inent; and. that their work might proceed with more
diligence and regularity, he eftablithed proper infpec-
tors and overseers; ·frequently beffowed with his own
hand considerable rewards on those who distinguished
themselves most by their induffry and skill; ·a'nd afed
to converse with them with great familiarity., All the
threets of Syracule were thronged with artificers; and
nothing was to be heard but the noise of their work.
In a very short while, therefore, a prodigious quantity
of arms of: every kind wiere prepared, and a great num-~
ber of galleys built, some of three, some of fise benches
.of oars; so that he soon had a fleet of 200 galleys com-
pletely jfitted out; and a number of warlike engines cor-
responding to his other preparationsl

After fin;ishing his naval armament, Dionyflus began

next to raise an anny. The large pay offered by him
enticed soldi~ers to Syracule front all q uarter~s, particu-
larly from Greece; and Dionayflus omitted no means
to gain the affe~tiona of those soldiers. 'Of late indeed
he was become quite a new man in every refped. In-
Riead of the cruel, imperious, and despotic tyrant, he
was now the humane, generous, merciful prince; and
his present con'duat ffaced all remembrance of his past
behavPiour.

To remove as far as possible every obstacle to his

great design, hI~e endeavoured to conciliate the ~friend-
tlhip of two powerful cities, Rhegium and MiefiTna. Then
he bethought himself of providing an heir to his throne;
and with that view contra~ted a double marriage; ta-
~laing to wife both Ariftomache the daughter of one of
the richest citizens of Syracuse, and Doris the daughter
of a ocrian of 'diftiniEtion. Ariffomache was sifter to
the famous Dion, for whom his brother-in-law soon
conceived such a high, efieem and to firong a friendship,
that he gave orders to furnish him with whatever money
hd' thould demand. Dion was a man of a lofty, noble
foul, and had <;ontrated a firong relifhn for the philofa- phy

jy and conversation of Platio, who in the course of
his travels had halted some time at Syracus~e. Dio~n
took all the opportunities th'at the greait confidence and;
credit reposed in him by Dionyiius prefen ted, to give
that prince fochr counsel as he thought he flood in
nreed of.

All the prep3arations for war being now finished, Dio-

nyflus acquainted the Syracufans with: his intentions of
declaring war againit the Carthaginians; and at the
'famre time laid before them his mrotives for so great adl
undertakring; namnely, that the Carthaginians had been
abways the profeffed enemies of the Greeks -; and that
.both the honour and the interest of the. Greek cities
called loudly for· their deliverance fromt the yoke of bar-
barians. The Syracufans very highly applauded the
magnanimous intentions of Dionymf~s;S innuediately be.
gan hoffilities, by putting to death and plunderiing the
effefts of all the Carthaginians found in their city; and
dis~patched -a herald to Carthage to make a public decla-
ration of war. This piece' of news greatly alamed
. the Carthaginians; who were the more afflefied by it,
that they had lately fuffered much by a plague. They
were not, however, dis~couraged; but made preparations
for a vigorous defence.

D~ionyflus had already a powerful army on foot, a-

mounting to 80,000 foot and 3000 horse, which was be-
sides daily increasing; and his fleet consisted of 2 oo gal.
leys. At the fight: of so formidable an army, most of
the Carthaginian cities in Sicily voluntarily opened their
gates to the Syraculains; but fame of them resolved to
Rtand a siege. On the other hand, thei Carthaginianr ge-·
neral Imilco, dispatched against Syracute a fmnall. Equa-
<tron of ten galleys, which entering thle harbour in the
night, deftroyred a good number of t~hips. Dionyflus
was in the mean time employed in besieging Myetya,
which made a very obstinate refifftance. But having
taken it at last, he put all the inhabitants to the sword,
and gave the city up to be plundered.

The Carthaginians affemnbling all their troops, advan-

ced

ced towards Palermo with a land-army of goo,ooo foot
and*4000 horse, and a fleet of 400 galleys. With there
powerful forces Imilceo laid siege to Meflina, and took it
after a very brave defence on the part of the besieged.
Dioxiyiius, unable to make head against an army to much
superior to his own, was deserted by many of his alhies,
and obliged to retreat to ~Syracuse. Having mn the
mean time levied freth troops, Dionyflus once more
took~ the field. Imilco having separated himself from his
fleet, Dionyilus gave orders to his admiral Leptinus im-
mediatel y to attack~ the Carthaginian fleet;i but this at-
tetrpt proved very unfortunate. Leptinars was fixr-
rounded by the superior number of the Carthagugian
galleys; and Mago, who commanded· them, cut In pre-
ces foch of the Syracufans as endeavoured to save them-
se~lves by swimming. In this engagement, the Syracu-
fans loft more than 20,ooo men, and upwards of a 00
ga nyfigs, on receiving the news of this defeat, re-
turned idt baite to Syracure. Imilco, after [ipending
fame time in resitting his fleet and ~allowing his army to
repose themselves, failed towards Syracure, and entered
the harbour with an air of triumph; while his land ar-
my marched up to the city on the land fide, and offered
battle to the Syracufans, who dared not to accept the
challenge. Imilco therefore meeting with no refiftarice,
laid waste the country, made himself master of the fu-
burb of: Acradina, and' prepared to. besiege the city.
But while he lay encamped before Syracuse, Polyzen us,
one of Dionyfius's brothers-in-law, arrived to his offift-
ance with thirty thips. The Syracufans thereupon re-
fame their courage, attack the Carthagxmian fleet, and
atfter a tharp engagemnent take eighty of their galleys,
and re-enter theif' city in triumnph.

Diony~ius happened to be ablent from the city, taking~

measures for a proper supply of provisions, at the txme
this ecngag emnent. The Syracufans, emboldened by
their foccefs, formed the design of thaking off the ty-
rant's yoke. .But Dionyfirls arriving in the mean txme,

conP

"congratulated with the Syracufans on their good for-
tune; and affe~red them, that he would take fish mea-
sores as thould very soon bring the war to a happy con.
sion. At the very time, however, that he w~as giving
them there flattering hopes, one of the citizens riamed
'Theodorusr, a man ofadangiptosdpoto,
flood up and made a speech to tetuu affmby whrein,
'after defe~ribing to them in a lively manner the various
instances of tyranny committed by Dionyfrus, and the
cruel oppreilion under which he had made the Syracu-
fans to groan, he exhorted all present inftanttly to assert
their liberty. But Pharacides the Lacedemonian, who
commanded the fleet, flanding up next, desired the affem-
bly to advert, that his countrymen had sent him thither
to afi~lt the Syracuf~ans and D3ionyr~us, not to make war
on Dionyflus. This -speech cooled the ardour of the
conspirators, and threw them intbgreat confiernation a
for they did not doubt that D~ionyfins would very fpee-
dily mpakRe them feel the effe~s of his resentment. But
they were happily miftakren. Dionyflus had already
learned, by experience, that severe meafulres tended ra.
ther to irritate than to reclaim; and had resolved for
the future to endeavour ·to- make .himself to be beloved,
and not feared, by his fubjets. ·On this occasion there-
fore he fludied, by a mild and complaisant behaviour,
and by the force of presents, -to gain the affe~tion of
the people, even going so far as to invite several of thera
to eat at his tabl~e.

The affairs of the C~arthaginia~ns were now in a very

bad ficuation, the plague· having broken out in their ar-
my. The Syracufans- taking advantage of this unhappy~
carcumftance, attacked them by sea and land, threw
them into the greatelt disorder, funk many of their
ihips, and made a dreadful slaughter in their camp.
Imilco, desirous of favng .the remains of his troops, of-
fered Dionyflus a great f~um of money for permillion to
depart in peace with such of his thips and soldiers as yet
·remained. But Dionyflus refufred -to grant such per-
msiffiont, except tCo far as regarded the natives of Car-

thage

thage aloni; Imilco :therefore being obliged to leave
the reft: blehiidd,; th~e -Syracufanss the following night, asi
gain attacked the camp .of the miserable barbariansb
who finding themse~lves betrayed by Imilco, betookr
themselves ~to flight, but ~were mofily cut in pieces by
the Syraculans. Thu~s was humbled the pride of the
Carthagininians, at the very time when they entertained
the most sa8nguine hopes off~ubd~uing the whole island of

T'houlghthtbe Gatthagirdat·1s were now dispersed, and

q~uiet was thereby reffored to Syrrac~f~e j y9et Dionyflus
was far from enjoying the· general~ calmn, hymi~g mt con-
(aant~,dread .of· attempts agairifh his life. -Ais he diltruft.
ed the foreign troops .in his service, he placed them in
Leontius,- an~d committed "the care of his prerfon to a
troop of'llaves whom he had s~et at libei-ty.

It was about this ti~me that the GOaulgi who had lately

.hurnt Rhrme,. sent ambaffadarts to make an alliance with
Dionyflus, who happened then to be in Italy. Having
there gained ·a great vitacry over the Greekis of that
country, and taken many of them prison~ers, Dionyflus
fiet them ~all at liberty without ransom, aind by: thiat- adb of
generosity made to many. firm and zjealous friends of

fhDionyflus entertained a violent refeatrenet againlt the
inhabitants of Rhegiuml for the provoking answer they
had .return~ed,·when he begged of them to give him some
lady of their city to be his w7ife. They told his ambaffa·
dor, that .lhey could -·et him have no other than the
.daughter of their public eikecutioner,. who if he pleased
was at his service. In revenge, D~ionyfins laid siege to
their city. The besieged finding themselves unable to re-
sift him, proposed terms of capitulation. But Diany Gus;
intending to ruin them entirely, refus~ed to radie the
siege, except on condition of their paying him a fam, a-
xnounting to nearly L. 80,ooo Sterling; of their deliver-
ing up to him all their thip; and of their putting into
h~is hands xoo· holtages. After having by therie means
dis~abled them from Imaking. any great ref~itane, he con-L

a t~rived

trived some pretcace for attacking themn anwwthe tot*
lowi-ng year, when he again b~esieged their city. - The
inhabitants perceiving that the teyrant aimed at nothing
le~ss than their utter deftwaui~on, defended ,themselves
with great· obitinacy. But afte'r fufitaining the siege for
eleven months, being at last .reduced to all the horr~ors
;of famine, they were forced to s~urrender at dif-
cereion. By this time the inhabitants were half g88.
dead of hunger, and present~ed the most- meagre
ghastly figures imaginable. Dionyflus made dooo of
them prisoners, and obliged fach of them as had any
money or efFeats remaining to pay him a ransom. But
his cruelty did not flop there. He resolved iro take ven-
geance on Phyton the chief magiffrate of the town for
the brave defence he. had made. H~e thaerefore.caufed
the son of that gallant officer to be £1rown headlong into
.the sea in his father's fight; and then ordered the father
himself to be whipt through the t own; to be inul~ted in
the most thocking manner ; and then to be ·thrown into
the sea likewise.-
SThe ,extratordinary passion of D)ionyflus· for poetry and
the Belles Lettres has been particularly noticed by hiffo-
rians; who tell us, that he took great delight in the
conversation of men of genius, and. was remarkably fond
of the arts and sciences.· So far, no doubt, his taste, was
highly commendable. But he carried his love of poe-
try to a ridiculous height's affeating to compose himself,
.without poffefinzrg ·any of the rzequifite talents ; and dif-
covering greater joy at having written a few flupid ver-
fes, than at obtaining the moit important vi~tory. It is
hardly pofihble to carry this species of folly to a higher
pitch than Dionyflus did. Hfe employed his time in
composing tragedies, insisted that his pieces th'ould be
called excellent, and would f~uffer no competitor on that
point. So that he may -be said to have exercised his
~tyranny even over the mind. For a man of his high rank;
to imagine that his honour was concerned in being ac-
.counted' a fine poet, was certainly an inflance of folly
greatly to be pitied; and he farely did not refiedt, that

farme

some talents, which are highly eitimabile in a. private per-
for, may ill become a prince, especially if. he piques
himself on excelling in them. As all courts abound iii
flatterers, Dionyflus found many persons about his, who
encouraged his rxdiculous vanity in this particular, by
beltowing the most extravagant encomiums on all his
poetical produalons.

But not satisfied with being thought the best poet in

his own kingdom, he desired that his fame might be
spread abroad ; and for that purpose dispatched -his bro-
ther Thearides to the Olym~pic games, to~ contend in his
name for the prize of poetry and of the c-hariot races;
that his merit in the poetical way might be published in
that great assembly of all the Greeks. But the fuccels
was ·very far from anfiyering his expe~fations. For
though his brother pitched on a man of a morft agreable
voice, and who was very Mkilful at bess owing on verses
all the graces; of elocution, to read the poems of Diony-
flus, ~yet the audience quaickly discovered th~eir real me-
rit, hi~fted without ceremony those miserable comnpoli.
tions, and were very merry at the expence ofthe! poeti-
cal talents of Dioonyius. Nor was he more fortunate in
his chariot-races. H-is horses being as unskilful in that
exnercife as their master was in the art of poetry, ran off
with an ungovernable impetuosity, and broke the cha-
riot in pieces against the goal.

The unfavourable reception of his poems at the Olym-

pic games by no means cured Dionysius of his folly. He
b~elieved himself to be as excellent a poet as ever. His con-
ceit on this Point was to extravagant, that it was not only
very dangerous for any person to centure his compodi-
-tions, but even not to appear full of admiration when
he read them. In this refpe~t his courtiers perfealyg
complied with his humour. But he was one day so
provoked at the poet Philoxenes for declaring his ~senti-
anents too freely about''one of his pieces, that he ordered
him to be thrown into prison. In consequence, how-
ever, of the earnest intercession of all the first people at
court, the honelt poet ·was· soon releafedl from his con-

finement.

Rhieme~t . Dionyflus :belihg extremely -defarous of pro-
:curinrg the approba~tion of his brother poet, infilled ividi
-Philaxenus the very day he w~as set at liberty, when be
diappened to be at ·tab~le wTith h~im, to give hiis opiniionr
of what he elteerned his best ·ijiece. But ~Philojreifusei
who was inrcapabl~e offiatt-ery, inficad of answering Dioc
nyflus, addressed h-imself to his guards, crying outi
-'rCome, carry kine lack to ·thte Quarfie> ;" the naimeodf t~he
ub~li~c ·prison. The ·prince perceived rth meaning of
Pherfe words; biut restrained his a~ngeir, a~nd cease~d to urge
-PhIlosenus anyp farther.

The passion of 3Dionyflus for cornpofing increated

·daily;i and he is fa~i to have again feh~t fTome of his veires
to the Olyzmpic garnes; where they met with the fame!
receiption as the former. ' he news of diis disgrace
-threw him into a ·kirr-d of ~fury, wihiich he vented on some
of his b~est Ifriends, whom hie accufedi of corhbining virith

Sthe public works he was carrying on abouit the city and

·Cttacking Epirus, in the hopie-s of getting poffeflion of

'the occasion to his friends; but in the height of his

joy, he eat and drank to s~uch excess as brought

_372 2.on a surfeit, whereof he died in a few days,

after a reign of thirty-eight years.

It cannot be disputed that Dionyflus was an artful po-

litician and a brave commander. B~Put his ambition and
~his cruelty refleat great dishonour on his memory. He
showed himnfelf on many occasions to be a man abfo-
lutely void of all religion ; and seemed to insult the gods
by the pleasantry with which he accompanied his facri-
leg~ious aats. As he was one day plundering a temple
of Jupiter, a cloak of gold placed on the statue of that
god having attra~ted his notice, he immediately ordered
it to be taken away ; saying, that foch a cloak was too
heavy for summer and too cold for winter; and he ordered
a woollen one to be put in its place, which he s~aid was con-
venient for ~all seasons : He jefied in the fame manner on
the golden beard of - Ef~culapius, which he likewise: took
away; observing, that it was improper for the son of:
Apollo to have a beard while his father was with-
cut- one. As the silver Itables which he found in the
templies bore this infecription, "' To the good gods," he:
o fed to sTay, that it was but just to profit by their good-
ners. Hle even boasted of his~implety ; for Cicero tells
us, that as Dionyflus was once returning with a fa-
vourable wind to Syracure, after plundering the temple
of Proserpine at Locri, he desired his friends to obs~erve
aC what a favourable voyage the _gods befftowed on the
"L i~pious !")

Dionyflus paid verjr dear for his dignity and sovereign

power by the constant apprehension in which he lived.
To s~ecure his life he h~ad recours~e to the most extraor-
dinary precautions. Hiffory takes notice of fame of
thaofe. WVe are informed, for exgmple, that he always
wore a coat of mail under his robe; and that he [p~oke
to the people of Syracuse from the top of a tower.
Hearing that his ·barber boaftled of having permniion to
put his razor: on the tyrant's t~hroat, he caused him to

be ~ut toi death, and obliged his own daughters to thlave
Bim. But when they were growrn up, thinking it un-
fadfe to truss the razor even in their. hands, he found out
die expedient of singeing his beard Arith unlt-thells. HItis
bed was T~urrounded by a wide aind dee~p ditch, over
wlhich was a draw-bridge; and every night, after care.
fully examining all the corners of his chiamber, and pro.
perly securing the door, he used to reniove the draw-
bridge before retiring to reit. H~is· treatment of Da-
modes, who ofed to tell him that he was the happiest
man in the world, is well known.1 jHe desired ·him' to
fit down at a table covered with the most magnificent
and delicate dishes, in a chamber filled with the fwveeteft
perfumes, w~here he was attended by a number of slaves
ready to obey the smallest signal; but behold, dire~tly
above his head hung a1 naked f~werd by a single hair !
Could ther~e in eiffec2 be a more lively image of the situ-
ation of a tyrant ? But it is fit: to observe, that Diony-
fius tookr these extraordinary methods to secure his life
only in the beginning of his reign, and before his power
was firmly eftablithed, when alarmed by daily confpiram
cies. Afterwards he c~onversed with his f~ubje~ts in the
Smoft open and familiar manner ; and was always of easy
access to every· body.

D,"ionyf)u~s th~ner yoneals the fan of Dionyfies the

elderby Dois ofLocri. The Syraculans, now ofa

long while accustomed to fubje~tion, admitted him
peaceably to afib~me the sovereign power that had been
Senjoped by his father, who, it must be acknowledged,
had rescued Sicily from the Carthaginian yoke, and had
greatly augmented the naval firength of the Syracufanas.
But the son was as peaceably disposed as the father had
been aftive and enterprising, less indeed from wisdom
and moderation than from his natural indolence.

In- the beg~inning of his reign, Dion, of whom we

.have made some mention already, thought it` his duty as
brother-in-law to the father to ass~ist the f'on with. his s~er-
vice and counsel; and therefore offered to take the com-
mand of an capedition into Africa, to div~ert the storm

N n with

with which .the Carthiagini~ans were~ threatening Sicily.
This ·propoful of Dion was by nia means relirhed by the
oth~er couzrti~ers by wh~om he wmas envie~d and difi~ked:
it ftrikitiag liffiance of a very general truth, that a man
at court is not always at 'liberty to do the good he de-
fires. 'P=r haprs this maxim held more true at the court
o~fDionyfius than at any other. For it ias composed
o'f a parcel o'f you-ng Idebauchees, who flud~ibd to keep
that prince immnerfed in e~ffeminacy and sloth, and
vishollyt emiployed in the most tham~eful pleafuires. W~e
Eirre told that iforwi~edures they w~ouldf khep their young
prince engaged in an ·unittermitting T~cene of riot and
in~toirication fbr mionths to~gethe'r. TIhiere courtiers prac-
tired, therefore, evrery art to exasperate Dioniyflus againlt
~Diion, w~hom they represented as an impertinent cents-
rer and a ' misanthrope. IZt is true, indeed, that D~ion
was ·a man of a very stoical arid auit~re charadter; and
that his most int~im~ate -friends complained of the fieverity
of his temper. This did not, however, pirevent him
~from being highly esteemed on accounnt of his great abi-
lities and the su~periority of his understanding. D~ion
thought, that the most essential service he could at pre-
frent ren~der ·eith~er 'to ·his country or to his prince, was to
cultivate the under~Itanding of Diontyflus ; who, though
his education had beeh much n~egleaed, was not void of
parts. He n-iudied therefore to minpire him with just ideas
ds virtue, honour, and the other mott important duties
of l~ife; and to conned him with men -of genius and in-
tegrity, who might infiruat hhn in an agreeable man-
nmer, and as it were by flealth. Dion began this com-
mendable work with giving Dionyflus a very advanta-
geous aecount of the fi-ne parts of P~lato, at that time in
great renown, deferibing him not only as a man of won-
derful geniu~s, but as a mo~t agreeable companion, and
a profdond flatefi'nan. B3y thefec means he ins~pired Dio-
nyflus with an earnett desire to ·be acquainted with that
excellent philosopher.

Dionyflus accordin31ly dispatched several messengers

to invite the phitofop~her to his court. .·But Plazto; who

w~aS

wdas not Ignorant of that prince's real charader, was exr-
t~remely' back ward to comply with this invitation, from a
belief that his lessons would have but little, effedt upon
him. -Dion at last, who had been a scholar of the phi-
lofopher's, was obliged to join his' requleft to that of the
prince; and he showed Plato so clearly the great need
in which Dionysius flood of his infirnfigns, that he at
last corifeated to undertake the journey, and accordingly
set out for Sicily D~ionytius received the philosopher
with every mar of honour and refpeat; and treated
.him with the great~est kindness. A wtife prince cannot
in~deed pmr too high a value on a man c~apable· of in-
itma~ing him in his duty, .and of telling him the truth.
T'he poffefiron offish a man is a treafine ofineftimable
y alue.

Plato afi~duoufly applied himself to fulfil the' bufinefit

for which he had come into Sicily ; and by his mild and
insinuating behaviour soon gained the confidence of Di-
onyflus, inspired him with a love of virtue, and made
him fentible how un worthy his past conduat had been of
a king, who ought to be uniformly employed about the
happines~s of his people. Idis inclinations, therefore,
tools a different turn, and bie now fludied nothing fd
much as to be acquainted with his duty. Capable at
length of diftinguiihing men of genius, he took no plea-
sure in any other company; and from the converf~atxon
of such men, he soon learned several of the moRt va-
inable branches of knowledge. His courtiers, a set of
men who apply themfeklves principally to co~py after their.
master, quickly follo'wed his example; by which means
the Rtudly of arts and sciences became the reigning taff'e
at the court of Dionyflus. Tha~t prince, contraating in-
fenfibjly the habit of reflecion, employed his attention
. about the duties of royalty; and for that purpose ap.-
plied himself to the fludy of hiltory, which furnished
him with many examples of princes who had excelled
'both in the fe~ience and in ·the praftical part li~kewise of
government.

The courtiers were not alarmed while Dionyfaluscon-.

·11 ng sned

fined him~self to the Anudy of the ifciences. But percei-
ving, that in conf'ormity with the lessons of Plato, he had
resolved to dikcharge the duties of his flation himself,
and to examine every .thing by the 'rules of his own
ju'dgment, they began to dread his becoming too clear-
sighted, and therefore. exerted their utmot: efforts to
break offbis intercour'fe with Plato.. They, in the firlt
Iplace, openly dec~lared their suspicion, that a design was
formed of inspiring him with a' loire of philosophy, to
give him a disgust at the~ crown; insinuating that Dion
wouid -not be displeased to advance to the regal dignity,
In his place, one 0f his nephews, sons of the late k~ing
by his Afiter Ariffomache. Thely neact endeavoured to
dgpreciate Plato -in the opinion of Dionyflus, telling him,
that the philosopher fludied to acquire an unbecoming
ascendant over him; and that: he engaged him in a
course of life unsuitable to .his rank and to his years :
and laffly, to render Dion fulpeated, they advised hinx
to take measures for the fedurity of his throne and life.

Thdfe, and many other insi~nuations of the fame kind,

had but too great an effea on the weak naind ofl~iony-
~flus, and soon rendered him extremely fuipicious. H'a-
ying to far gained· their point, the courtiers, to complete
their Idefign, next put in pra~tice a most abominable im-
posture, by forging letters in the name of Dion to the
Carthaginian ambaffadars, advifingp the ambassadors,
-whien they had a mind to treat with Dionysius, to call
himn, fDion, to affilt at the conferences, because .he
could be of service in procuring them a more advanta-
geous Pnd durable peace. TIhefe letters having been
fePcretly shown to Dionyflus, were to I in fufficient evi-
dence againit Dion, whom he ordered to be imnmediate-
ly apprehended and carried to Italy. These or-
pers were punatually executed.----Dion appear- 372
ing a little while after in the Peloponnese, all
htais money and effeas to a very considerable amount
pvere, by permiflionn o fthe tyrant, frent thither to him by
hi~s nreations.s

DIQor

Dionyflus next desired· Plato to remove to the citadel,

uynder pretence of' doing him honour, bu't in reality to
prevent his following Dion. For, according to Plutarch,
that prince entertained a fort of tyrannical regard for
Plato, desiring to -engross his whole affeaion himself,
and unwilling that the philosopher thould efleem D~ion
more than him. A war breaking out: about this time
against Dionyflus, very luckily furnished Plato with a
plausible pretext for desiring to be sent back to Greece.
Dionyflus at taking leave prefled hits to accept of ma-
ny valuable presents, which, however, the philosopher
obitinately refused.

As Plato was returning, on tlhis occasion, to his na-

tive country, he happened ~at Olympia to fall in with
certain foreigners, among whom he lodged for some
time. Though the philosopher tnold them his name on-
d~icir fieft meeting, the foreigners, from his plain unaf~
seated behaviour and converfatiorn, were far from fuT-
peting that he was the famous Plato, of whom they had
heard foch extraordinary things. This is a very firiking
proof of the singular modesty of Plato, and plainly
ihow~s us, that he wicas far from making a parade of
his knowledge, or of agitating in common conversation
any of the questions handled by him in the acaderty.
But on the present occasion his felf-love was amply re-
compenfed ; for there foreigners having accompanied
him to Athens, and lodged for some time in his house,
at last begged the favour of him to introduce them to
the celebrated philosopher of his name. Plato then
finiding it impossible to conceal himself any longer, told
them, faniling, that he himself was the man whom they
desired so much to knotw.

Dion having gone to live faome time at Athens, ap-

plied: himself diligently to the fludy of philosophy, and
c~ontraaed an intimate friendihip with the philosopher
Speufippus, the nephew and fchollar of Plato, a man who
knew perfeely well how to unite the purest principles
of philosophy with the ease and, politeness of common

N n3 4ion,

Dkii3n, while at Athetis, defe~ayed the exspenee of thbe

public games, which it felt to Plato'is turn to exrhibit.
HEe afterwards vi~sited s~everal other of the cities of
Greece, itudying by all means to cultivate the acquaint-
ance andl conversation of such of the c~itizens as wt~ere
best acquainted with the nature of the constitution of
each particellar iflate; and he was every where received
w iith the hig~heftz ma~rks of diftin tion.

DionyTfus, apprehensive left Plato, on his departure,

thiould d~epre-ciatet him in the' opinion of the Greeks, in-
vited to ·his court the meft learned men of Italy, in or-
der to show that he still retained his lovre of letters.
WFith those Italian literaiti h-e afl-~tecd to h~ol frequent
co~nverfgtions·; in which he took every opportunity to
display his own learning, by repeati~ng the lessons he had
r~ecei~ved fi~ro Plato on vari~ous fubje~its of philosophy.
But his tockr was soon exrhau~t~ed. Sefi~ble now,. by
e-xperienee, of; the advantages he had derived from the
society of Plate, he grew very desirous of prevailing on
that philosopher to returp to cpo~rt, and pra~tlifed everyT
mneans for that effe~~t.

Dio-nyflus wrote to all his ac~quai~ntance, and, among

the reft, even to Dion ~himself, intreating them to Use
their endeavours to persuade Pl~ato to gratify his desire
of: another visit from him ; and Plato at last was pre-
vtailed on, th~ough. with the utmost releftance, to comply
wnith his request.~ I doubt the behaviour of that cele,
brated philos~ophe~r may not in this initance appear al-
Stogether so prudent as from his charafter might have
been expeteid. Two galleys were~ dispatched by Dio-
nyflus to bring Plato to Syrac-ule; where, as soon as
he arrived, that prince treated him with all imaginable
refpeAt, and made him his principal confident. But
fflato zearlous to effe~t the recal of D;on,, which' Dio-
pyfis ha~d previously engaged to grant, began to urge
that f~ubjeft, and pressed it on Feireral different occallons;
buit Dioixyfus as of-ten declined, under various pre.
rences, to comply withi his desire. -This behaviour
qstIcidy prodpced as mif~under~tanding between the

prmnce

p~rintce and the pio~fo~ph~er; but both. were -careftil to
cgonceal their real. sentimen~ts Ebot the world. At latt,
'.howrever, Dionylflus, unable to retirain hims~elf any
longer, order·ed all the: lands belonging to Dion to be
fIold, a~d· applied the p-rice: of them to his own nfe.
ITh~en he commanded lodgingfs to bxe provided for Plato
without the caflte, and among the guards, to w~hom the
philosopher was very obnoxious, on acco~iune of his fre-
qu~ent exhortations to Dionylus. to difin~its them, and
to~ renounce the tyranny. P~lato, pe~reiv-ing that his
life was now mn danger, made earneff·ap~pi:a ication for
leave to· return to Greece ; which at last he was happy
enou~gh to obtain. Dionylu-s, depriv~ed· of the wife
counsels, of that admrirabbe philosopher, returned by de-
grees to his. former life;t and hf~is, court very fooln became
t~he re~:dene ofdiipation and riot.

Dion hearing that the t-yran~-~had fold his poliFeffions,

and had so treacherously broaken his promise;, openly
proclaimed his refeatment, and resolve~d to punish him
by· force of arms. To this he. wras warmly urged by
the Syracufan's, wh-o intreated him to come to their re-
lief ; and aiFured him, that the whole city would join
him as soon as he thouald make his appearance among
them. D~ion thereFore privatlely enlikted about Boo
foreign troops, all hardy veterans, comnpletely armed ;
embarked them at different dties, and in fmnaN partiies,
rand fixred on the island of Z~acintha as the place of gene-
ral rendezvous., The hifterian waho has related ·this ena-
terprife, juffly observes, that it was. one of the mo& da-
ring that could well be imagined. It it truly amazing,
~that a man with no more than two~ transport~s, andi 80
soldiers, thould venture to attack a prince fopported by
at navy of 400 thips of war, an army of a o,oom9 men, a
vaif quantity of warlike flores and provisions, and who
was forereign of one of the fk~rongeft cities then in the
wNorld.

D4ion having landed at Minoa, a small town in Sicily,

to refreth himself and his soldiers after the fatigue of
ithe voyage, was informed, that Dionypflus was then

absent

ablent from Syracute, and had undertaken an exped~i-
tion towards the coast: of Italy, attended by 8o galleys,
His soldiers thereupon immediately desired to be ·led
direaly to Syracule. The news of his arrival havmng
Spread abroad, his small army was greatly increased mn
its march; and on his arriving within half a league of
the city, he found himself at the head of about Sooo
men. The most considerabl.e citizens went out to meet,
and to conduc2t him into ·the city ; and the populace
tore in pieces those infamous creatures of the tyrant
who had served him as [pies and informrers.

pion entered Sy~racut~e at the head of his army drawn

plp in battle arra~y; attended by his brother MVegacles on
the one hand, and by the Athenian Callipus on the
other. He immediately ordered the Syraclifans to be
informed, by public proclamation, that he and his bro~-
thier were come to deliver them, and all the inhabitants
of Sicily, from slavery and tyranny; and mountung an
eminence, he made them a speech, exfhorting them to
exert their utmost efforts for the recovery of their liber-
ty. The Syra~cufans named him and his brother com-
anlanders in chief, with forereign authority.

Dionysius having returned s~oon- after,aand entered

the citadel from the sea, the Syracufans instantly took
arms. The tyrant thinking his affairs desperate, sent
am~bassadors to treat with Dion and the Syracufans;
who returned for answ~er, That before they would listen
to any proposals, he must abdicate the tyranny. Divers
conferences having ensued upon that fubjeA, Dionyflus
endeavoured to protraft them as much as pofisble, that
he raight have time to concert proper measures; and at
last he took a convenient- oppoittomty to make a sodden
attack upon the wall with which the enemy had f~ur-
rounded the citadel. .The Syracufans, who guarded that
post, seized with a panic at the suddenness of the attackt
betook: themselves to .flight. Dion advancmng mn great
haste to the place, afed his utmost endeavours to rally
his soldiers, but in vain. Throwing himself, ho~wever,
iinto the midit of the enemy, he made a dreadful flaugb

ter of them. But his courage urging him too far, he
was wounded in the thand, thrown down, and with
diff~iculty rescued by his soldiers out: of the midst of the
tyrant'ts men. As his wound was not dangerous, he in-
flantly ran in quest of his foreign troops, who where in
Acradina, and led them on to the charge. These be.
ing all well dikciplined veteran soldiers, made a vigorous
attack on the troops of Dionyflus, already fatigued by
the engagemenit, cut in pieces the greatest part- of them,
and put ·the reft to flight.

Dionyflus, alarmed at this viaory of Dion, sent him

letters, by a herald, so artfully and maliciously expressed,
as to create f~u-picions· among the Syracufans, of their
having reposed too high an authority in Dion. The
Syracufans fell into the snare. Forgetting, at once, all
the important services performed by Dion for their ad-
vantage, they gave credit to the injurious insinuations
of the tyrant. In these circumitances, Heraclides, one
of the banifhied citizens, arrived at Syracute with seven
veLffels, to assist his countrymen against Dionyflus. He-
raclides was a man of great bravery, and of an infinua.
ting address; but -secretly are. enemy of Dion, by whose
evil genius he s~eemed to have been, at this critical time,
condtidted to' Syracuse, to throw a t~hoofagnd obitacles in
the way of that great man, and to obscure the glory of
hiis sal~ons.

Heraclides, immediately on his arrival, was, by the

Syracufans, created high adnmiral· of their fleet ; and tho'
he openly behaved to Dion with great refpec7; and de-
ference, yet he laboured under-band to prepoffer's the
people against him, and gave a malicious interpretation
to all his aftions. Dionyflus, in the mean time, offered
to Dion to deliver up the citadel, together w~ith the
troops, arms, and every thing~ else contained in it, if
the Syracufans would permit him to retire in peace -to
Italy,~ and allow him the revenue of certain lands for
his fubliffence. These terms having been rejeaeed by
the Syracufans, D~ionyflus soon after rook the opportu-
pity of a favourable wind to set fail for Italy, with all

h1S

his tre-atures and molk valur~able efffts, -committing the
defence of the citadel to his son Apolledorus.

Ans soon. as the fight- of Drionyi·Tus was knnown, Hera-

clides propiofei~d, in the public affesbly, to make a new
distribution of the lands belonging to the city. But
this proposal being oppafed by Dion, the Syr acufans
were ~furt-her confirmed in their sufjut fulplcious of
him; and no longer setting asy bounds. to thest angra-
titude, they tampered with? the foreign troops to mnduce
.them to abandon Diron. But thzefe forcagners, far more
faithful to their co~mma2nder than his own countrymen,
for whom ~he had performed furch impor~tant s~ervices,
reje~ted their proposals, and throwing themselves round
Irion, resolved to convey hire safely out of the city.
Dion, extending his arms, nfed the snoft affeting ge-
fitres, to mlove she compagiron of his fel~ow-citizens.
But. perceiving all his intreaties to be ineffe~tual-, and
dreading left outrage >night succeed to· uxgratitude, he
or~dereb his troops to mnarch wIcith v~ery close ranks, and
'like m~en prepared to attack th~eir enemz~es, in fe
e~scaping; in th~is mlanner fromt Syracute, took refuge
among the Leosntines, who received himt with muchs
kindness and humanity.

T'he sol~diers of the tyrant being, in the mean time,

extrexcely harafled by famine, were on the point of de-
livering up. the citadel to the Syracufans. But Nxpflus
arriving with supplies of corn and other provisions
from iDionyflus, they altered their resolution, and re-
solved to continue the defence of the citadel. The Sy-
racufa'ns, manning their gslleys, attacked the fleet of
Nipflus, and f~unk several of his thips. Elated wxth this
fuccefa, they gave themselves up to rejoxcmng and de+
bauchery, disregarding the admomesions of their com-~
manders, who warned them of their danger. Nipflus,
informed of what was paging, seized the wall that fur-
·rounded the citadel, 494 dispatched his tro'ops into the
city~, writh peraxigion to pillage it. There soldiers attack
all that come in their way, murder the citizens, plun-
der their ho~uses,· and ~cimmit s thoyfanid diforiters. The

TShe Syracdfans, its this extreinity, st-ein nbo other re-

inedy to their misforrtenes. than ·ihe recalling d'f ~Dion,
'feat him deputies, who, Ythowing thems~elves in tears at
his feet, imaplore his amitance. We thould at first ima-
gine, that D~ion, on this occallon, would bie inextorable,
and juffly tell th Syracuths, that th~ey inerited their
prefenit ifui~rings. B'ut the fou~l of 'Dion was fouperior
to foch sentimen~ts. H-e received the deputi~es very kind-~
ly ; and moved both by the miseries of his fellow-citi-
stens, and by the intreaties ·of his foreigna troops, he
marched withoutr delay to Syracuse. Nipfins, inforined2
of his ceominrg, .made a second irroption into the 'town,
which produced thIe fame murrders and disorders as be-
fore; and, to complete the d-e~rntion of the city, th~e
soldiers ·of Nipflus s~et fire to it in several places, wherebyli
mnany hoofes were consumed.

.Such was the situation o~f things when Dion arrived

at Syracure. Immediately drawing up his troops in or-
der of battle, and dividing them into small parties, he
entered the city, and marched against -the enemy ·amid
the most joyful thouts of the inhabitants, .who hailed
himn, as he wvent along, as~ their deliverer. A~f~ter leadfing
his soldiers through the ~theets, fiurrounded with Hfames,
be at lait reached the enemy; ·who feeing the Syraculans
on the point of being revenged on them by the means of
D)ion, were animated with rage and difpair. Bult the
soldiers of Dion, encouraged by ·the thouts of the inha-
bitants, made ·a most ·vigorous attack on the troops of
Nipflus, who were entrench~ed near the wall that fur-
toun~ded the citadel, forced their entrenchmnents, killed
the: greatest part of them, and obliged the reft to11yP for
refuge to the citadel. The remaining part of tre night
w~as employed by the Syracufans in extmnguifhing the
flames.

Next day, the friends of Dion endeavouzred to per-

fuade him to take vengeance on his ene~mies, and par-
'ticularly on Heradlides; wnho, instigated by the blackest
fnaice, hkad been 'principally inftirumental mn flatirrmJg~ u-p
his countrymen afgainft bits·. Butf that Breat man, -who·

waFfs

was fulperior to all motifves of revenge, told them, that
during his long residence in the academy, he had learnt
to s~ubdue his ·pafiTons; and that the forreft markl of this
important viaoryji was to behave with humanity and
forgivenes~s towards those by whom we are injured.

Then he employred both the Syracufans and his fol-

diers to throw tap a firong palifado around the citadel.
The Syracufans again deleed him generalifilmoo : and
Heraclides, unable to remain in quiet, recommenced
his cabals against Dion. But all his mnalicious attempts
proved abortive.

The siege of the citadel being waarmly preffred by Di-

on, the garrison grew mutinous for want of provilions,
and forced the fen of Dionyflus, by whom ,they were
then commanded, to capitulate; who, after delivering
up the citadel, with all the warlike flores within it, to
Dion, emnbarked, together with his mother and ~fiffers,
on board-of five galleys, and failed in quest of his fatherl
Dion found his wife Arete in the citadel; and their
meeting, after so long a separation, was most affeation-
ate and tender. Then he very generously rewarded
those ·who had fought on his fide, proportioning his re-
wards to the merit and rank of each.

Thus did Dion reffore her ancient liberty to Syra-

cufe. The fame of this revolution having quickly
f'pread over all Greece, and reached even to Carthage,
D~ion was rank~ed -with the wifefit and most f~uccefsful
commanders. But this great man, amidst all his glory,
and while even Plato himself was writing him that the
eyes of the whole earth were fixed on him as the sue-
cef~sful champion of liberty, itill retained his former mo-
alefty and simplicity.

Dion proposed to establish, at Syracuse, the ariffo-

cratical form of government. But Heracides persisting
in his seditious praatices, and findying to gain, by every
means, the favour of the multitude, resolved to oppose:
this ·defgn. Dion, perceiving that there would be no
eixd to diffentions and troubles in the city while H~era-
clides was alive, cod~ented to the urgent remonftrances of~

of his friends, to have that fa~tious man affaffina'ted.
But Dion is filid to have felt so severe remorse for having
given his consent to the murder of Heraclidfes, that
thenceforward his tranquility entirely deserted him, and
he funk into dye deepelt melancholy; which was still
further beightened by the death of his favuourite son,
which happened soon after.

Callipus, an Athenian, a man of a most ambitious

disposition, had conc~eived the design of makring himself
matter of Syracuse. But perceivinrg that he could never
s~ucceed in his projea while Dion was alive,,he resolved
to have that· worthy patriot murdered, though he had
formerly lived in very intimate friendship wi~th him. For
that purpose, he contrived means to get some
Zacynthian soldiers admitted into the house of 356.
Dion, who was murdered by them in his bed.
Immediately afterwards Ariftomnache, the fiffer of Dion,
and widow of the elder Dionyflus, and Arete the wife
of Dion, were seized by Icetas the Syracufain, a man in
the interests of Callipus, were thrown into prison, and
soon after, by the in~fluence of the fame Callipus, were
drowned in the ~sea.

C'allipus enjoyed but a thort while the fruits of his

villan~y. For though he got poffefli~on of Syracuse, and
exercised the forereign power for the space of a year ;
yet having marched out of the city to lay siege to
Catana, the Syracufans took the opportunity of his ab-
fence to thake off his~yoke: and the report of hris crime
having spread over all Sicily, he became every where an
objeat of detestation. Hipparious, the brother of the
youn~ger Dionysius, arriving, in the mean time, at Sy-
racufe, with a fleet and a considerable body of troops,
destroyed all the hopes of Callipus in that city, and go-
verned the inhabitants with desPotic fwnay for the space
of two years. At last, by a just effedt of providence,
which, sooner or later, punishes the wickedness~ of men,
Callipus was put to death by Polifperchon. .

The most diftinguiihing· features of Dion's charadter

were, his elevated sentiments; his~ bravery; his ex-

Sicily. Timoleon woas then living extieremely retired, and op-
pressed with mnelancholyt and .grief, occafiored: by the
following incident. His elder brother Tiziiophanes, for
whorn he entertained a firong affe~ion, having made
hindfelf tyrant of Corinth, Timoleon ~was exrtremney
grieved at his conduat, and to induce him to renounce
his sovereignty, employed ecvery motive and argunenrt
that friendship or affeaion could suggest; B~ut there
proving ineffeasali he pro~ceeded even to threats. Akll,
however, was to no purpore. At last t~he lov~e of his
'country prevaitlng over the ties o'f blood, Timoleon re-
solved to have his brother affailinated. W~ith this iriew
hie demanded another conference with Timophane's
wherein he repeated in the inoik taffeaing manner all h~is
fortner argumnents; but feeing him obitinate, he burit
into tears, and covering his face with his cloak', the as-
ifaIins immediately dispatched the tyrant. At frirf thrs
adtion was pralifed as the utmolt effort of patriotism and
virtne; but afte·rwards it came to be considered as a
laibit c roel a~nd unnatural murder. Timoleon, there-
fore, was thrinented with the mobft bitter remorse; which
was heighltte~ned by the constant reproaches of his mo-
ther. D~iffrad~ed with forrowc, he resolv~ed to put art
end to his life; and it was with the greateift difficulty
that his friends diverted him from this desperate purpole.
Yielding, however, at last to their remonfirances, he
retired to the country, anrd for twelve years hived in the
deepest folituide. B~ut haaving beeri at-leng~th persuaded
to return to Corinth, he received the command of the
troops desti~ned for Sicily.

SIcetas, in the mean time, hearing of the preparations
mak~ing by the Corinthianrs for the relief of the Syracu-
Fans; was baSe enough to betray the latter, and to make
an agyreerixent with the Carthaginians, who .engaged to
raise him to the sovereignty of Syracuse after the ex-
pulfion of Dionyf~lus thould bes effeated. Icetas at the
fame time fe'nt the Corinthians word, that havinrg de-

Oo [p~aired

fpaired of Timoleon's comping, he had prevailed with
the Carthaginians to afifit him. The Corinthians, ifut-
pefting his treachery, hastened the departure of Timo-
leon with ten galleys. Timoleon, on landing in Sicily,
received intelligence, that Icetas had defeated. Diony-
flus, and that the Carthaginians were making difpoth
tions for preventing him and the Corinthian troops from
entering Syracure. This intelligence proved true; for
they had dispatched twenty galleys to Rhegium to op-
]pefie his advancing. Timoledsn therefore was under the
necefitiy, .either of hazar ding an engagement with his
slender army against: an enemy twice as numerous, or
of permitting Icetas quietly to reap the fruits of his
treachery, and to aiffime the sovereignty ofSyracufe.

Timoleon having, by the intercefi~on of the people of

Rhegium, whro wished well to his cause, obtained a con.
ference with the Carthaginian commanders, amus~ed
them with various proposals, to gain time till his, galleys
had passed the Carthaginian fleet, and were out of all
danger of being intercepted. Then Timoleon broke off
the conference, and soon ca~me up with his galleys. Ice-
tas, who was then master of the city, and kept Diony.
flus blocked up in the citadel, hearing of Timoleon's
arrival, assembled all the Carthaginxan forces, consist-
ing,~ as is reported, of r50 thips, 50,qoo infantry, and
300 armed chariots. The whole army of Timoleo-n a-
mnounted to no more than a 2,ooo men.

Things were in this situation when the inhabitants of

Adrana, a finall city of Sicily, having quarrelled among
themselves, one of the faftions sided with Icetas and
the other with Timoleon. The Carthaginians hearing
of this, dispatched 5000 men to Adrana. But just as
there troops arrived, and were busy forming their camp,
Timoleon with his small army suddenly attacked them,
put them to flig~ht,' killed 300 of them, and took posses-
sion of their camp. The Adranites immediately opened
their gates to the conqueror; and D~ionysius hearing of
TIimnoleon's success, sent him word, that he was resolved
to surrender himself to the Corinthians, and to put them

in po-e son of the citadel. Timoleon accordingly cons-
trived to throw 4oo men into the citadel by night, who
we-re by Dionyflus put in poifelion of all his w\arlike
flores, and reinforced by r ood men, who yet remained
in his fervi'ce; after which the tyrant went on board of a
thip, arrived at the Corinthian camp, and wtas by Tis
moleon sent to Corinth.

The arrival of Didanyflus at that city aftforded

an agreeable Th~iow to th~e inhabitaints ; who, from i347'
their violent hatred of tyranny, were; delighted to
fee a man debased from the rank of a prince- to that of
a private gentleman. The rrean behaviour of Dionyfici
rendered him (till more contemnptible : for he passed hth
day in taverns in the company of fats and drunkards.
H2ere we have a firikinig infl~ance-- of the extraiordinary
vicfifitudes of human affairs. -i)ionyflus, bred in the
midst of opulence, was at last reduced to the most ek-
treme poverty ; and after ·being s~overeign of a very
powerful people, ended his days in the Rtation o~f a
[choolmafter. Perhaps, s~ays Cicero jeftinzg, being un-
iable to live without erierciting government, he chose t6
exert his authorityi over a parcel of boys infitead of a
greadt rlation.

Icetas in thie mean time ofect his u'tmot~ e~f~forts to reb

ducei= the c~itadel, and was extremely attentive to pre'
9ent the arrival of any reiniforcement from Timoleon.·
But in his absence Leoii, who commanded in the cita-
del, mrade a fallyi on the troops left before it by Icetas,
killed many of them, and took poffeffion of Acradina.
Timoleon, on the oth~er hand, receising a reinforceu
ment from Corinth, eluded the trigilance of the Car'tha-
giniams galleys, took MRedina, and then advaniredl toe
wards Syracuse with no more thain 4000 meiz. In the
mean time he employed proper persons to tampeir with
the soldiers of Icetas i to labour to imfprefs them: with
the idea of its being dis~grac~eful in Sicilianis to expore
their lives in faubje~ting their native country to the yoke
of the Carthaginians, who had always ihown themfelives
to be their inveterate enemies; and to aifure them, that

Oos if

if Icethas could be persuaded to join Timoleon, the Car-
thaginians, by their joint e-fforts, might be very soon
totally expelled fromt Sicily.~ There reports reaching the
ears of Mago. the Carthaginian general, he thought
himself betrayed; and in spite of the remonfirances of
Icetas, embarked with his troops for Africa.

T~imoleon, thus freed from the Carthaginians,

attacked, the day after t'heir departure, the city 346.
of Syracuse on three different sides, and with
fluch Aucceth, that the troops of Icetas were put to flight,
a~nd the city was taken on the first assault without the
loss of a single Corinth~ian. As soon as tranquillity was
reffored in the city, Timoleon convinced the Syracu.
fans of the necefiTty of demolishing the citadel, which
he called the tyrant's nefl. In compliance with his ad-
v~ice, all, th~e fortifications, . together with: the palaces of
bo~th the Dionyflufes, were in a few days levelled with
the ground.

T'imoleon perceiving that Syraacure, by its intestine

commotions and its wars with the Carthaginians, was
in a great measure depopulated, ordered proclamation
to be made thi-ough all Greece, that liberty being now
reffored to Syracur~e, every person who inclined to go
thither to fettle, thould receive a proportion of the lands
belonging to the city equal to that of the natives of the
city of the fame rank. In consequence of this procla-
mation, a new'c~olony of Greeks, amounting to 60,000
sauls, quickly arrived at Syracuse. The behaviour of
tlimoleon on this occasion is truly admirable; for he
preferred the honour of being the refforer of Syracute
to that of being its king. After diffributing the lands,
. he fold by au~tionl all the statues that had belonged to
the tyrants.

But desirous of totally rooting tyranny out of Sicily,

he led his troops. against Icetas; obliged him to re-
nounce his alliance with the Carthaginians, and to de-
molifh~ all the caffles and forts in his poffefiron. Having
thus reduced him to the flation of a private man, he
sent him to Corinth. H-e ofed Leptinus tyrant of A-

pollonia

pollonia in the fame manner.--~Having f~uccefsfully, ac-
complifhed these undertakings, he returned to Syracule,
and applied himself to eftablifih good laws, and to en-
force the observance of them.

But more laurels were still referred for him in the

fields of iMars. The Carthaginians again invaded Sicily
with a fleet of 200 thips and 70,000 men, under the
command· of Hamilcar and Hal~drubal, and landed near
the: promontory of Lily-beum. Timoleon iminediately
marched against them with an army of no more, as is re-
ported, than 6000 mlen; and furprifingr them at the de-
file of Crimefus, attacked them in flank, wihile a dread-
ful2 florm of lightning and rain s~uddenly arising, comn-
pleted their disorder. Trimoleon takring advantage of
their confiernation, penetrated their ranks with great
slaughter, put thern to flight, and took I 5,000 priforii-
ers, with an immense booty. The number of killed
on the fide of the Carthagilnians is said to have been

I 3,oo0. Tlimole'on, on returning to Syracuse, put the finishing
hand to his laws and regulations. But he was soon as.
ter obliged once more to take the field against: the Car-
thaginians; who had invaded the island anew at the in-
fligation of the tyrants of Catana and M/Pedina, per..
f~uaded to that measure by Icetas. But the event of this
expedition was even more, unfortunate for the Carthagi-
nians than that of the former. Tiimoleon, to cut off
the evil at its fCource, went: in pursuit of Icetas; and ha-
ving taken him, caused his head to be struck off. Thus
was avenged the murder of D~ion's wife and fiffter, put
to death, as we have mentioned above, by this seditious
man Icetas. TPhis train of foccefs gave the Carthagi-
nians to high an opinion of Timnoleon, that they s~ued to
him for peace.

Timoleon, after extinguithing -tyranny in every city

of Sicily, and comp~eting the great work of reformation
in the government of Syracul~e, resigned ·all authority,
.and reduced hfimfelf to the rankr of a private citizen.
Removingf soon after to the country with his wife and

Oo 3 chirl.

children, he passed the remainingS part of his life' in re-
tirement, enjoying the secret fatrisfaation of having re-
flored liberty and quiet to all the cities of Sicily.

Some years before his death ·he became blind. The

S~yraculans, full of affe~tionn and ref~pr a for their. deli.
verer, used, by way of consolation for that misfortune,
to pay him frequent vifits,' and to carry him in a chair:
to the theatre, where his presence excited univers~al ac.
clamations from the fpeftators. His funeral was ce.
lebrated at the public expence ; and the Sy-racufans
citablifhed annual rejoicings in honour of his memory.
Of all the great men of Greece Timoleon_ is perhaps the
only- one who, satisfied with his success, pursued the
proper course for' avoiding the ingratitude of his fellow..
Citizens, and ended his days in tranquillity and peace.

Tijmoleon poffeffed all the qlualificanions of a great ge.

sreral, and a difinterefied attachment to the public .wel.
fare. C~ornelius Nepos mentions a circumstance that
reflefts additional luffre on all his other great. qualities.
ri~hen any person happened in his presence to exapatiate
in encomiums on his wisdom, his bravery, and the glo.
ry he had acquired- in hav-ing humbled fa macy tyirants,
Timoleon used to answer, that he molt Guc-erely thanked
th~e gods for choofng hinl preferably to anay other generstal,
as th~e infi~rument of their great goodnes~s, in refforing
liberty and quiet to Sicily; being firmly perfusided, adds
the fame hiltorian, that no human event is brought a-
bout but by the immediate interposition of the gods ::
At s~entiment worthy of the most enlightened ChriftiaP.

TThe liberty reffored by Timoleon to Syracule

was but of ihort duration. Agathocles poifeiFfed 3r9.
hims~elf of the furprem~e power in that city ; and
behaved with the most thocking; cruelty, never hefita-
ting at the greatest crimes. Thiss Agathocles undertook
the mast daring enterprile recorded in hiffory. Being
unable to make head againlt: the Carthaginians, who
were carrying every thinlg before them in Sicily, and
were wrarmly besieg:ing Syracute itself, he boldly left his
en~vn, country, carried the war into the, dominions of

Car.

Carthage in Africa, reduced the firongeft towns, .and
laid waste the country. After a great variety of events,
in the course of which Agathod~es had left Africa, and
had. given the command there to another person, he
again returned thither himself ; but finding all his con-
quests loft, he was obliged to fly to Syracure. There,
too, his ill fortune attended him; for the Syracufans
had taken the advantage of his ablence to revolt. All
his projeats being thus ruined, he ended his days in a
manner worthy of his crimes.

The Syracufans after this enjoyed for some time the
iweets of liberty ; but were much harassed by the Car-
thaginians, who persecuted them with continual wars,
and obliged them to call to their afifrtance Pyrrhus king
of Epire. That prince was very f~uccefsful againit their
enemies; but other affairs soon carried him from their

country. Upon the departure of Pyrrhus, the Syracufans crea-
ted Hiero chief magiffrate, and afterwards be-
flowed on him both the title and. the power of 268.
Icing. Hiero was fuccefsful againit the Cartha-
ginians, and enjoyed a very long and peaceable reignl

Hyeronymus succeeded Hiero, but reigned cmly a

year. On his death nothing but confusion prevadled in
.Syracuse. Andranadorus the fon-in-law of Hiero seized
on the island and citadel. -The senate sent deputies to
treat with him; and he agreed to s~ubmit. But at the
initigation of his wife, a woman of a most ambitious
[pirit, he entered into a conspiracy with Themiltes for
raising himself to the throne. The conspiracy having
been discovered, the conspirators were put to death by
order of th~e magiffrates. The people hearing of thest
design, were initantly seized with the most ung~overn-
able finy, crying out, that the race of tyrants ought to
be totally extirpated. A scene of borror ensued ; from
which we may conceive of what exceffIes an enraged
multitude is capable. Th~ey first murdered Demarata
the daughter of their late king, and wife of Andrano-
qlorUs, together with Harmonia the wife of Theni~ftes;

O3o 4p then

then they ranl to the house of Heraclea wife of Zoipus ,
and, deaf to the tears and iApplications of that lady,
who intreated .them to spare her two daughters, whose
age was fufficient to move compa~ffon in more feeling
befoms, they first murdered her, and then her daugh-
.ters all covered with- their mother's blood.

After thus satiating their cruelty, they ele~ted Epicy-

des and Hippocrates principal Fnagiltrates; who being
.both ldevotedt to the interest of the Garthaginians, la.
boured to inspire their countrymen with an averflon to
the. Roman power.---The Romans, informed of the si-
tuation of things in Sicily, and desirous of making them-
~felv'es masters of 10 pleasant and fruitful a country, dif-
patchied thither the consul M~arcellus, who had become
-faubros by his success agai~nst Hannibal, to end~eavour to
reduce it. MYarcellus, on his mrarch towards Syracuse,
fTent messengers to acquaint the Syracufans th~at he was
advancitig wi~ith an intention of refforing themn to liberty,
not to op~press them with war. Epicydes, however, and
his colleague Hippocrates, refused to admit him into
the city; and told him with great presumption, that
they would make him sensible of the difference betwixt
Syracute and Leontium, a city lately taken by the Ro-
man cons~ul.

Marcellus, provoked at this insulting answer, ordered

~Appirus to attack Syracuse on the land· fide, at the quar-
ter called Hexapilucs, while he himself with sixty galleys
block~ed it up by fea' on the Acradina quarter. The Sy-
racufans were now in the utmost consternation, thinkr-
ing it impossible for. them to hold out for any confider-
able time against the Roman power. But one single
man, who happened at this time to be ihut up in Syra-
cof~e, was destined to defeat all the efflorts of this formi-
dable enlemy for the space of eight months.

Archimedes, one of the greatest mathematicians of

antiquity, was'the man of whom we speak. Reso~lved
to attempt every thing for the defence of his country,
he put in praftice all the resources of his wonderful ge-
nius in machinery; and rendered this siege one of the

longest:

Iongeft and moss bloody * that ever the Romans underT
.cook. The particulars recorded. of the many engines
invented by -him for fruffrating the attacks of the belie-
gers, and for annoying them in their turn, are so extra-
.ordinary and wonderful, as to ·exceed all credibility,
were they not recounted by the graveRt and most credi-
ble hifforians. Some of those engines ditcharged against
the Roman infantry stones of an enormous bulk, which
crushed in pieces whatever came in their way; and by
the havoc they produced, resembled in fomne degree
those terrible fire-arms since invented by mankind for
their mutual deftru £ion. Others let fall s~uch ponderous
w~eights on the Roman galleys, as instantly funk them.
Another engine more extraordinary still, was so contri-
ved, as with .an iron arm of amazing firength to seize a
weifel by the prowji, ·to lift her up to a considerable
height, and then to let her fall wnith her whole weight,
so as to finkl or break her to pieces. Others daihed in
pieces the firongeft machines of the besiegers.

In this manner. did Archimedes baffle for the space of

e=ight months all the attacks of the Romans:= Of s~uch
great use, on some o'ccafions, is a single man of genius
and science. ~IVIarcellus, wearied out with so long a re~-
tiftance, turned the siege into a blockade; and leaving
Appius before Syracute with two~-thirds of the army,
marched hi~mself into other parts of the island, to reduce
some cities to the obedience of the Romans.

TThe consul employed part of the second year of the

siege in various expeditions through the iflarid. But in the
mean time, a Carthaginian fleet having found means to
convey a supply of provisions into Syracure, Marcellus,
on his return to that city about the beginning of the
third campaign, found things in such a ficuation, that he
began to delpair of taking the place. In these circum-
stances, a Roman soldier having discovered a part of the
wall near the gate of Trogilus considerably lower than
the reft, and capable of being Sealed by ordinary lad-
rders, communicated the discovery to Marcellus; w~hoim-
Inediately ordered ladders to be gotten ready, and taking

ad-

advantage of a feast celebrated by the Syraculans in ho.
nour of Diana, comr-na~nded a detachment of his bravest
soldiers to advance to the pliace in the dead of night.
Trhefe quickly sealed the wall, broke open the gate, and
took pofFetion o'f the quarter of the town called Epipoisj.
The Syracufans, awakened by the nois~e, began to put
themselves in a posture of defence. But Marcellus or-
dering all the trumpets of the Roman armny to found at
at once, created foch. an alarm, that the inhabitants were
thrown into the utmaft consternation, believing the city
to be wholly in the hands of the enemy. But the quar-
ter of A~cradina was not taken. Epicydes, affem-
bling fame troops, resolved to attack Marcellus; but
finding his forces too weak, he was forced to retire to
A9cradjfna.

It is said that Marcellus, on contemplating from the

top of a tower the largeness and beauty of this city, thed
tears at the thoughts of the miserable fate it was about
to undergo. From the fame motive,· before proceed-
ing to the attack of Acradina, he sent several officers to
exhort- thei belieged to propore a capitulation, and to
prevent the ruin of their city. His remonfira~nces, how-
ever, proving ineffeatual, he made the proper diSpositions
for the frege of Acradina. But a plague break~ing out
about this time in the city'and in the Roman camp,
protrafted a little longer the fate of Syracuse.

The Carthaginian fleet having, in the mean time re-

turned to Sicily, .Epicydes endeavoured to pers~uade
Bomilcar who commanded it, to venture a fea-fight,
and to attack Marcellus. The Roman, though inferior
in naval firength, res~olved not to decline the engage-
ment, and to be by that means blocked up in the har-
bour of Syracuse. He therefore advanced with his
fleet in good order. The: Carthaginian general, intimi-
dated by their determined appearance, was afraid to
venture a battle, and therefore retired. Epicydes, who
had gone out to join the Carthaginian fleet, wras seized
with derpair ; and not daring to return to Syracuse, fad-
ed away -for Ag~rigentum. The

The inhabitants, confoiunded at being deserted both

by the Carthaginians and by Eipicydes, sent ambassadors
to Marcellus to treat about capitulating, and to try to
prevail with him not to destroy their city entirely. But
the Roman deferrers, fearing to be delivered up, trook
arms together with the , foreign soldiers, murdered the
new maagiff rates, and resolved to defend the place to the
last. In the mean time, one of the chief commanders
being gained over by Marcellus, admitted` the Romans
at night by one of the gates of Acradina. The Syra.
cofans next day threw open all the other gates to Mjar.
cellus; and sent ambassadors to beg that he would grant
'them their lives, which they obtained. But Mlarcellus,
provokied~ at their perfidy and o~bftinare resistance, gave
up the city to be plundered. The riches found in it
by the Romans exceeded their moss ~sanguine
expeflations, being greater thanh even thos~e of ex 2.
Carthage. Thus was Syracule reduced after a
siege of three years.

Marcellus was much delighted with the hopes of

finding in this city the man whose wonderful genius
had so long baffl~ed the bravest efforts of the Romnan
arms; and the~refore ordered diligent search to be every
where made for Archimedes. A private soldier finding
him at lafCt, deeply intent on t-he solution of some geo-
metrical problem, comm~anded him to go along with
him to Marcellus. Archimedes very quietly begged of
the soldier to wait a few moments till be thould finifh.his
problem. But the soldier, mistaking his requelt for an'
absolute refusal to obey him, st~abbed him with his sw~ord
on the spot.

Mbarcellus was ·extremely grieved for the death of'

Archimedes; and by the honours paid to his memory,
plainly evinced the high opinion' heentertained of his
merit. He gave his body a very pompous funeral, and
caused a sumptuous monument to be erefted to his me-
mory. He even extended his favour to the relations of
Archimedes, on whom he beitowed diftinguithing and
ad~vantageous privileges. Cicero tells us, that more

thsan

than 140 years after this event, when the mernory of
Archimedes was almost loft: among his own country-
men, he himnfelf bad the curiosit~y to make inquiry a-
bout his tomb, which after a painful search he had the
ple~asure at lalt: to find; discovering it by a pillar, where-
on was delineated the figure of a sphere and cylinder,
with an infeription on the foot of it, pointing out the
proportion· that a sphere bears to a cylinder of the
fame base and altitude, which is as that of a to 3: a
propolition that was dricovered and demonfirated by
Prchbime~des.

Tghe tranfCa~ions at Syracuse, after its redual~on by

the Romans, are not very interesting ; and, as well as
the affairs of Greater Greece, fall more properly under
the Rom~an hilto~ry than thrat of Greece. The whole
island of Sicily, after Syracute was taken, became a Ro-
man province; but continued nevertheless to be go-
verned by its' own proper urages and coultitutions, in
the fame manner as before its f~ubje~tion.

Consi~derable places in Greatter Greee.

IN Greater Greece, hiffory takes notice of three fa.

mosn cities in the neighbourhood of Tarenturn, viz.

r. Crotona, a Greek colony founded by M/ikcellus

chief of the Acheans. This was the birth-place of
Mcilo the celebrated wrestler, thence called The Croto-

mtan.I

2. Sybaris, an Achean colony likewise, and in the

fame province with Crotona. This city, in process of
time, became very powerful and rich; but: its excefT
five wealth occasioned the most thameful corruption of
manners among its inhabitants, who passed their whole
time in public diverflons, feasts, and debauchery. Their
effeminacyy and sensuality were so great, as to render
them a proverb among the ancients. They would not
even permit to reside in their city such tradesmen as
made a noise in working. At last fadian blroke: out a-
mong them; and the richer fort having been expelled, un~-

knplored foccour of the Crotonians. The Sybarites
tookr the field, and engaged the Crotonians, command-
ed by M~ilo; but were totally defeated. Thenceforward
Sybaris was quite def~erredl.

. g Thu~riucm, founded in the neighbourhood of the

ancient Sybaris by an Athenian colony. Here the fa-
mous H-lerodotus fixed his residence. The inhabitanrts'
were compos~ed partly of Sybarites, and partly of Athe-
nian froldiers sent· to their allifiance against the Cro-
tonians.

Eminent Wr-iters, Philosophers, Artif3is, dec..

Pythag~oras, the celebrated philosopher, was the

founder of the Italic school, which received that ap-
pellation from his having fettled in that part of Italy
called Greater Gre~ce. He was a native of- Samos, and
spent the more early part of his life in travelling through
many countries in purs~uit of infirudtion. WTith this
view, he visited Egypt, Chaldea, and the ifiand of
Crete. Finding, on his retirn from his travels, his na-
tive country oppressed by the tyrant Polycrates, he did
not choofre to fettle there; but removed to Crotona, and
opened a school which fooin grew very famous, the
number of his f~chlars having in a thort time increased
to Soo. 'This school wsas in its most flourishing slate a-
bout the time of Tarquin the last king; of the Romans,
aind the year before Christ 5 30.- For the two firrt years
of their attendance, the Ccholars of Pythagoras were en-
joined a profound silence; but afterwards they had per-
mission to propose their difficulties. Never was a ma-
fier so highly refped~ed by his scholars; a proof of the
great elteem they entertained of his genius. His opi-
nions with them had the authority of so many oracles;
and all further doubt was laid aside on these words
being pronounced, Ador ;cpot : C T~he mnafier himself bath
"c Jaid j8."

Pythagoras thought it an undertaking worthy his wis-

dom~

dom and philosophy, to reclaim the inhabitants of Croi
tona to sen~timents of virtue ; and the effeats of his ex-
hortations were, by the account of Juffin, truly extraor~-
dinary, producing a wonderful reformation among the
i'nbabitants of that city, who wuere before plunged in the
utmolt exceifs of luxury and debauchery ; so lively
were his representations of the bafeners of vice and in-
temperance on the one haind, and of the beapty and
excellency of virtue on the other. To the fair he re-
comnmended modesty, and the other qualities becoming
the s~ex:; and to the youth, refpe £6 for their parents. So-
briety he extolled as the mother of vitrue ; and intreat-
ed the youth of both sexes to lay aside the splendid and
anneceffary ornaments of dress, as being the principal
·infiruments of corruption. He inspired rulers and ma-
giftrates with principles of hon~our, with integrity, and
with a zealous attachment to the public welfare. ]In a
word, he in a manner made new men of the inhabitants
of Crotona. 'Nor were his virtuous labours confined to
that city alone. He4 visited all the neighbouring towvns
with the famne laudable interntions. It was a maxim~a of
Pythagoras, that the whole aim of philosophy ought to
be,. to render men fitore acceptable in the fight of the
Deity, by inducing them to practile all the virtues of
huma-tuty. Pythagoras introduced into the weffern world a doc·
trine which he had imbibed s~omewhere in the east,
where, by all accounts, it has prevailed from the most
early ag~es, namely, that of the Metemap/ycho/is, or rran/-
migrations of Souls ; whi~ch taught, that on the deaths of
men, their fouls passed into and animated other bodies.
If, for example, ~a man was vicious and wickred, his foul
animated the bodyi of some unclean animal, and passed
through a progress of mifrer y proportioned to his crimes
in this life. H-ence Pythagoras and his followiers religi-
oufly abitained from .eating flesh, left, perhaps, they
thould devour that of~ fame of their former friends and
acqu~aintance. In all probability, the accounts of this

a Phi-

philosophy transmitted to us are very imnperfe~t; and in
nothing, perhaps, more so than its real scope and mean-
ing. L~et us therefore, on this -point, as on every
other of the fame kind, be extremely cautions in coni

demning. Antiquity has handed down a thousand impertinent
fables with -refpe~t to this great philosopher, which it
were more impertinent still to mention here. Accord-
ing to Juffin, Pythagora-s die~d at 1Vetapontum in a very
advanced age. The reputation of his school was very
great, and produced many philosophers of diftinguithed
reputation, who divided themselves into a variety of dif-
rent ~eats.

Charondas, a scholar of Pythagoras, delivered to the

inhabitants of TThurirjm a flytem of excellent laws, of
which the following were fome-of the most remarkable.
WMhoever entered into a frecond marriage, after having
children of a former, was deprived of his privilege of
becoming a senator: Those conviated of calumny, were .
ignominiously dragged through the city= : ublic ma-
fiers were to be appointed for the infiru~tion: of the
youth, without fee or reward; for he thought ignorance
the fouarce of all vice : `The education of orphans was
to be intruffied to their relations on the mother's fide;
and the care of their fortunes ~to those on the father's
fide: Deserters in war were condemned to appear pub-
lic~ly in the city for the space of three days in woman's
d refs.

Zalteucus, another scholar of Pythagoras, was the le-

giflator of the Locrians. The preamble to his laws is
much celebrated. He desires the citizens to keep in
mind, that gods do exist; and afizures them, that the
chief of the gods is the original fountain of all laws.
Then he sets down regulations for the prefiervation of
unanimity and peace in social intercourse. He exhorts
judges, by all means, to divest themselves of pre~judices,
whether arising from friendship or from animosity. He
prohibits women from wearing magnificent apparel; or

froms

from afing ruch superfluous and luxurious ornalisexits,-
as jewels .and bracelets, which w~ere allowed to proith-
tutes alone 7 and he delivers nearly the fame probibitiona
with refpeft to the men.
