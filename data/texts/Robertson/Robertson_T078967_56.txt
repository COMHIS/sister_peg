iv. America from Labrador to the contfines. of Florida;

and the Portuguese, , in quest of a shorter p.ffage
to the East Indies, had ventured into the northern
feat, and viewed the fame regions '. Thus, at
the period where I have chosen to take a view of
the state of the New World, its extent was knowr
almost from its northern extremity to thirty-five
degrees south of the equator. 1 he countries which
firetch from thence to the southern boundary of
America, the great empire of Peru, and the in.

thevatex. When we contemplate the New World, the
tent of the first circumstance that strikes us is its immense
Ncw World extent. It was not a small portion of the earth , so

inconsiderable that it might hlave escaped the ob.
servation or research of former ages which Co-
lumnbus discovered. He made known a new he-
mifphere, larger than either Europe, or Aia , or
Africa, the three noted divisions of the ancient
continent, and not rrilch inferior in dime'nsions to
a third part of the habitable globe.

America is remarkable not only for its magni-

tuile, but for its polition. It stretches from the
,orthcrn plolar circle to a high southern lati-
tudel, above liftccn hundred miles beyond the far-
tlheft extremity of the old continent on that iide oÂ£
the line. A country of such extent passes through

all the climates capable of becoming the habitation u o o x
of man, and fit for yielding the various produc- iv.
tions peculiar either to the temperate or to the
torrid regions of the earth.

Next to the extent of the New World, the Grand db.

grandeur of the objedts which it presents to view jettsitPDt.
is molt apt to strike the eye of an observer. Na- few.t
ture fecms here to have carried on her operations
iuon a larger scale, and with a bolder hand, and
to have diflinguifhed the features of this country
by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of ttsmouna
America are much superior in height to those in tains,
the other divisions of the globe. Even the plaih
of Quito, which may be confidered as the base of
the Andes, is elevated farther above the sea than
the top of the Pyrenees. This stupendous ridge of
the Andes, no less remarkable for extent than
elevation, rifes in different places more than one
third above the Pike of Teneriffe, the highest
land in the ancient hemisphere. The Andes may
literally be said to hide their heads in the clouds;
the ftorns often roll, and the thunder burfis be-
low their summits, which, though exposed to
the rays of the fun in the centre of the torrid zone,
are covered with everlasting snows '

ancient continent are not to be compared, either
for length of course, or the vast body of water
which they roll towards the ocean. The Ilarag-

they feel the influence of the tide, they resemble

lakes. The lakes of the New World are no less con-

fpicuous for grandeur than its mountains and
rivers. There is nothing in other parts of the
globe which resembles the prodigious chain of
lakes in North America. They may properly be
termed inland seas of fre[h water; and even those
of the second or third class in magnitude, are of
larger circuit (the Caspian sea excepted) than the
greatest lake of the ancient continent.

Its form fa. The New World is of a form extremely favor-
vorableto able to commercial intercourse. When a continent,
<commierce.

like Africa, is composed of one vast solid mass,
unbroken by arms of the sea penetrating into its
interior parts, with few large rivers, and those at
a considerable diltance from each other, the great-
er part of it seems destined to remain for ever
uncivilized, and to be debarred fiom any active
or enlarged communication with the reft of man-
kind. When, like Europe, a continent is opened
by inlets of the ocean of vast extent, such as the
Mediterranean and Baltic; or when, like Asia,
its coast is broken by deep bays advancing far
into the country, such as the Black Sea, the gulfs
of Arabia, of Peria , of Bengal , of Si;m , and of
Leotang; when the surrounding seas are filled

See NOTE II.

with large and fertile islands, and the continent B o o
itself watered with a variety of navigable rivers, Iv.
those regions may be said to possess whatever
can facilitate the progress of their inhabitants in
commerce and improvement. In all these refpets
America may bear a comparison with the other
quarters of the globe. The gulf of Mexico, which
flows in between North and South America, may
be confidered as a Mediterranean Tea, which
opens a maritime commerce with all the fertile
countries by which it is encircled. The islands
scattered in it are inferior only to those in the In-
dian Archipelago, in number, in magnitude, and
in value. As we stretch along the northern division
of the American hemisphere, the Bay of Chefapeak
presents a spacious inlet, which conducts the na.
vigator far into the interior parts of provinces no
lefs:fertile than extensive; and if ever theprogrefs
of culture and population ihall mitigate the ex.
treme rigor of the climate in the more northern dif-
tridts of America, Hudson's Bay may become as
subservient to commercial intercourse in that quar.
ter of the globe, as the Baltic is in Europe. The
other great portion of the New World is encom-
passed on every fide by the sea, except one narrow
neck, which separates the Atlantic from the Pacific
Ocean; and though it be not opened by spacious
bays or arms of the sea, its interior parts are ren-
dered accellible by a number of large rivers, fed
by so many auxiliary ftrcams, flowing in such
various directions, that, without any aid from the
hand of induflry and art, an inland navigation

B3

s o o i may be carried on through all the provinces from

TV. the river De la Plata to the gulf of Paria. Nor is

this bounty of Nature confined to the southern
division of America; its northern continent abounds
Io less in rivers which are navigable almost to.
their sources, and by its imnmenfe chain of lakes
provision is made for an inland communication,
more extensive and commodious than in any
quarter of the globe. The countries stretching
from the gulf of Darien on one fide, to that of
California on the other, which farm the chain
that binds the two parts of the American conti-
nent together, are not defsitute of peculiar advan-
tages. Their coast on one fide is washed by the
Atlantic Ocean, on the other by the Pacific. Some
of their rivers flow into the former, some into the
latter, and secure to them all the commercial be-
nefits that may result from a communication with
both.

Temperture But what most diftinguiflies America from other.
ofits Sli. parts of the earth, is the peculiar temperature of
TUstc. its climate, and the different laws to which it is

subject with respeCt to the difIribution of heat and
cold. We cannot determine with precision the
portion of heat felt in any part of the globe,
nerely by measuring its diltance from the equator,
The climate of a country is asseted , in some de-
gree , by its elevation above the lea , by the extent
of continent, by the nature of the foil, the height
of adjacent mountains, and many other circun-
flances. The influence of these, however, is,
from various cauLcs , less considerable in the greater

part of the ancient continent; and from knowing n o oK
the position of any country there, we can pro- IV.
nounce with greater certainty, what will be the
warmth of its climate ,and the nature of its pro-
dudtions.

The maxims which are founded upon obferva- Predomi.

tion of our hemisphere will not apply to the other. ""uIc ot
In the New World, cold predominates. The
rigor of the frigid zone extends over half of those
regions, which should be temperate by their pofi-
tion. Countries where the grape and the fig
fliould ripen, are buried under snow one half of
the year; and lands situated in the fame parallel
with the most fertile and belt cultivated provinces
in Europe, are chilled with perpetualfrofts, which
almost deflroy the power of vegetation'. As w.e
advance to those parts of America which lie in
the fame parallel with provinces of Asia and Africa,
-blessed with an uniform enjoyment of such genial
warmth as is most friendly to. life and to vegeta-
tion , the dominion of cold- continues to be felt,
and winter, though during a short period, often
r-eigns with extreme severity. If we proceed along
the American. continent into the torrid zone, we
fhiall find the cold prevalent in the New World
extending. itself also to this region of. the globe:,
and mitigating the excess of its fcrvor. Wbhie

unrcmitting heat, the inhanbitant of Peru breathes

B o o K tually shaded under a canopy of gray clouds, which

Iv. intercepts the fierce beams of the fun, without

obftruding his friendly influence $. Along the
eastern coast of America, the climate, though
more similar to that of the torrid zone in other
parts of the earth , is nevertheless considerably
milder than in those countries of Asia and Africa
which lie in the fame latitude. If from the fou-
them tropic we continue our progress to the ex-
tremity of the American continent, we meet with
frozen seas, and countries horrid, barren, and
scarcely habitable for cold, much sooner than in
the north '.

callntsor Various causes combine in rendering the climate
this, of America so extremely different from that of the

ancient continent. Though the utmost extent of
America towards the north be not yet discovered,
we know that it advances much nearer to the
pole than either Europe or Asia. Both these latter
have large seas to the north, which are open
during part of the year; and even when covered
with ice, the wind that blows over them is less
intensely cold than that which blows over land in
the fame high latitudes. But in America the land
itretches from the river St. Laurence towards the
pole, and spreads out immensely to the welft A
chain of enormous mountains, covered withfnow

and ice, runs through all this dreary region. The B o i
wind, in pafling over such an extent of high and Iv.
frozen land, becomes so impregnated with cold,
that it acquires a piercing keenness, which it
retains in its progress through warmer climates,
and is not entirely mitigated until it reaches the
Gulf of Mexico. Over all the continent of North
America, a north-westerly wind and excefiive
cold are synonymous terms. Even in the mol
sultry weather, the moment that the wind veers
to that quarter, its penetrating influence is felt in
a transition from heat to cold, no less violent than
sudden. To this powerful cause we may ascribe
the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its vio-
lent inroads into the southern provinces in that
part of the globe '.

Other causes, no less remarkable, diminish the

adcive power of heat in those parts of the Ame-
rican continent which lie between the tropics.
In all that portion of the globe, the wind blows
in an invariable,diretion from east to welt. As
this wind holds its course across the ancient con-
tinent, it arrives at the countries which stretch
along the western shore of Africa, inflamed with
all the fiery particles which it hath collected from
the sultry plains of Asia, and the burning sands
in the African deserts. Tie coast of Africa is, ac.
cordingly, the region of the earth which feels the
inoft fervent heat, and is exposed to the unmiti.

to the countries lying between the river of Sene-
gal and Cafraria, travcrfes the Atlantic Ocean-,
before it reaches the American shore. It is cooled
in its passage over this vast body of water, and
is felt as a refreahing gale along the coalt of Brasil ,
and Guiana, rendering there countries, though
among the warmest in America, temperate, when
compared with those which hie opposite to them
in Africa '. As this wind advances in its course
across America, it meets with immense plains,
covered with impenetrable forefis, or occupied
by large rivers, marshes, and stagnating waters,
where it can recover no considerable degree of
heat. At length it arrives at the Andes, which
run from north to south through the whole con-
tinent. In palltng over their elevated and frozen
summits, it is so thoroughly cooled, that the
greater part of the countries beyond them hardly
feel the ardor to which they seem exposed by
-their situation '. In the other provinces of Ame-
rica, from Tierra Ferme westward to the Vlexican
empire, the heat of the climate is tempered , in
some places, by the elevation of the land above
the sea, in others, by their extraordinary humidity,
and in all, by the cnormous mountains scattered

over this trad. The islands of Amerioa in the B o o K
Torrid Zone are either small or mountainous, Iv.
and are fanned alternately by refreshing sea and
land breezes.

The causes of the extraordinary cold towards

the southern limits of America, and in the seas
beyond it, cannot be ascertained in a manner
equally satisfying. It was long supposed that a vast
continent, difltnguifhed by the name of Terra
Australis Incoqnita, lay between the southern extre-
mity of America and the Antartic pole. 'I he
fame principles which account for the extraordinary
degree of cold in the northern regions of America,
were employed in order to explain that which is
felt at Cape Horn and the adjacent countries.
The immense extent of the southern continent,
and the large rivers which it poured into the ocean.,
were mentioned and admitted by philosophers as
causes sufficient to occasion the unusual fenration
of cold, and the still more uncommon appearances
of frozen seas in that region of the globe. But.
the imaginary continent to which such influence
was ascribed, having been searched for in vainl,
and the space which it was supposed to occupy
having heen, found to be an open sea, new con-
jecures mufi be formed with refpet to the causes
of a temperature of climate, so extremely different
from that which we experience in countries re-
moved at the fame distance from the oppofiQt
pole ".

o or After contemplating those permanent and cha.
iv. raceriftic qualities of the American continent,

Condition which arise from the peculiarity of its situation,
when firRt
discovered. and the disposition of its parts, the next object

that merits attention is its condition when first
discovered, as far as that depended upon the in-
duftry and operations of man. The effects of
human ingenuity and labor are more extensive
and considerable, than even our own vanity is
apt at first to imagine. When we survey the
face of the habitable globe, no small part of that
fertility and beauty, which we ascribe to the hand
of nature, is the work of man. His efforts, when
continued through a fuccefflion of ages, change
the appearance and improve the qualities of the
earth. As a great part of the ancient continent
has long been occupied by nations far advanced
in arts and industry, our eye is accustomed to
view the earth in that form which it assumes
when rendered fit to be the residence of a numer-
ous race of men, and to supply them wish nou-
rifhment.
Rude aud But in the New World, the state of mankind was

cultivat. ruder, and the aspect of Nature extremely different.

Throughout all its vast regions, there were only
two monarchies remarkable for extent of territory,
or distinguished by any progress in improvement.
The reft of this continent was possessed by small
independent tribes, destitute of arts and indutfry,
and neither capable to correct the defects, nor
desirous to meliorate the condition of that part of
the earth allotted to them for their habitation.

Countries, occupied by such people, were almost n a o o
in the fame state as if they had been without in- Iv.
habitants. Immense forests covered a great part of
the uncultivated earth; and as the hand of induflry
had not taught the rivers to run in a proper chan-
nel, or drained off the stagnating water, many of
the most fertile plains were overflowed with inun-
dations, or converted into marlhes. In the fou.
them provinces, where the warmth of the fun,
the moisture of the climate, and the fertility of
the foil, combine in calling forth the most vigor-
ous powers of vegetation, the woods are so choked
with its rank luxuriance, as to be almost imper-
vious, and the surface of the ground is hid from
the eye under a thick covering of shrubs and herbs
and weeds. In this slate of wild unaffifled nature,
a great part of the large provinces in South Ame.
rica, which extend from the bottom of the Andes
to the sea, still remain. The European colonies
have cleared and cultivated a few spots along the
coast, but the original race of inhabitants as rude
and indolent as ever, have done nothing to open
or improve a country, polTeffing almost every ad-
vantage of situation and climate. As we advance
towards the northern provinces of America, Na-
ture continues to wear the fame uncultivated aspet,
and in proportion as the rigor of the climate in.
creases, appears more desolate and horrid. There
the forests, though not encumbered with the fame
exuberance of vegetation, are of immense extent;
prodigious marfies overspread the plains, and few
marks appear of human aftivity in any attempt to

R o O cultivate or embellish the earth. No wonder that

Iv. the colonies ient from Europe were alonifhed at

their firtP entrance into the New WVorld. It appear-
ed to them waste, solitary, and uninviting. When
the Englilh began to fettle in America, they term-
ed the countries of which they took possession,
The Wiidcrncfs. Nothing but their eager expecda-
tion of finding mines of gold, could have induced
the Spaniards to penetrate through the woods and
marlhes of America, where, at every ftep, they
observed the extreme difference between the un-
cultivated face of Nature, and that which it acquires
under the forming hand of industry and art ".

Unwhole- The labor and operations of man not only
taime. improve and embellih the earth, but render it

more wholesome, and friendly to life. When any
region lies negle&ed and destitute of cultivation,
the air flagnates in the woods, putrid exhalations
arise from the waters; the surface of the earth,
loaded with rank vegetation, feels not the purify.
ing influence of the fun j the malignity of the
dillemnpers natural to the climate increases, and
new maladies no left noxious are engendered.
Accordingly, all the provinces of Ameiica, when
first discovered , were found to be remarkably
unhealthy. This the Spaniards experienced in
every expedition into the New W;orld, whether
dcefincd for conqucft or fettlernent. Ihough by
the natural conflitution of their bodies, their
habitual temperance, and the-pervevering vigor

of their minds, they were as much formed as any B o o g
people in Europe for active service in a sultry ivY
climate, they felt fevcrely the fatal and pernicious
qualities of those uncultivated regions through
which they marched, or wihere they endeavoured
to plant colonies. Great numbers were cut off by
the unknown and violent diseases with which they
were inficted. Such as survived the destructive
rage of those maladies, were not exempted from
the noxious influence of the climate. 'They return-
ed to Europe' according to the dcfcription of the
carly Spaniflh historians, feeble, emaciated, with
languid looks, and complexions of such a sickly
yellow color, as indicated the unwholesome
temperature of the countries where they had
resided ".

The uncultivated state of the New World Its aninmai

affected not only the temperature of the air; but
the qualities of its prodlucions. The principle of
life seems to have been less adive and vigorous
there, than in the ancient continent. Notwith-
standing the vast extent of America, and the
variety of its climates, the different species of
animals peculiar to it are much fewer in propor-
tion, than those of the other hemisphere. In the
islands, there were only four kinds of quadrupeds
known, the largest of which did not exceed the
size of a rabbit. On the continent, the variety
was greater; and though the individuals of each

1t o o i kind could not fail of multiplying exceedingly,

Iv. when almost unmolefled by men, who were

neither so numerous, nor so united in society, as
to be formidable enemies to the animal creation,
the number of diftind species mult still be confi-
dered as extremely small. Of two hundred differ-
ent kinds of animals spread over the face of the
earth, only about one third existed in America,
at the time of its discovery '. Nature was not
only less prolific in the New World, but fle ap-
pears likewise to have been less vigorous in her
productions. The animals originally belonging to
this quarter of the globe appear to be of an
inferior race, neither so robust, nor so fierce, as
those of the other continent. America gives birth
to no creature of such bulk as to be compared
with the elephant or rhinoceros, or that equals
the lion and tiger in strength and ferocity ".
The Tapyr of Brasil, the largest quadruped of
the ravenous tribe in the New Worlt, is not
larger than a calf of fix months old. The Puma
and Jaguar, its fiercest beafs of prey, which the
Europeans have inaccurately denominated lions
and tigers, possess neither the undaunted courage
of the former, nor the ravenous cruelty of the
latter ". They are inadtive and timid, hardly
formidable to man, and often turn their backs

upon the lea[t appearance of resistance 7. The B o o -
fame qualities in the climate of America which iv.
stinted the growth, and enfeebled the spirit, of
its native animals, have proved pernicious to such
as have migrated into it voluntarily fiom the
other continent, or have been transported thither
by the Europeans 8". The bears, the wolves, the
deer of America, are not equal in size to those
of the Old World ". Most of the domefic
animals, with which the Europeans have stored
the provinces wherein they fettled, have degene.

country whose temperature and foil seem to be

animal creation . -

New World, and those odious tribes, nourished

part of the torrid zone; they multiply faster, per.

IV. vated, and less peopled, than the other quarters

of the earth, the active principle of life waftes
its force in productions of this inferior form. The
air is often darkened with clouds of insets , and
the ground covered with flocking and noxious
reptiles. The country around Porto-Bello fwarrms
with toads in such multitudes, as hide the surface
of the earth. At Guyaquil, snakes and vipers are
hardly less numerous. Carthagena is infeRled with
numerous flocks of bats, which annoy not only
the cattle but the inhabitants 'l. In the islands,

that merits attention is, How was America peo

the one continent to the other ? and in wha
quarter is it most probable that a communication
was opened between them ?

concerning the human race spring from the fame source, an

the most enlightened people, the period of authen
tic history is extremely short, and every thing
prior to that is fabulous or obscure. It is no
surprising, then, that the unlettered inhabitants
of America, who have no solicitude about futurity,

and little curiosity concerning whatis past, should s o o t
be altogether unacquainted with their own v;.
original. The Californians and Efkimaux, in par-
ticular, who occupy those countries in America
which approach nearest to the ancient continent,
are so remarkably rude, that it is altogether vai'
to search among them for such information as
might discover the place from whence they came,
or the ancestors of whom they are descended '.
Whatever light has been thrown on this subjea,.
is derived, not from the natives of America, but
from the inqtifitive genius of their conquerors.

When the people of Europe unexpedtedly dif- Various

covered a New World, removed at a vast distance thcoxei.
from every part of the ancient continent which
was then known, and filled with inhabitants
whose appearance and manners differed remarkably
from the reft of the human species, the question
concerning their original became naturalily an
objeC of curiosity and attention. The theories and
speculations of ingenious men with refped to this
subjet, would fill many volumes; but are often
so wild and chimerical, that I should offer an
insult to the understanding of my readers, if I
attempted either minutely to enumerate or ta
refute them. Some have prefilmptuoufly imagined,
that the people of America were not the offspring
of the fame common parent with the reft of
mankind , but that they formed a separate race
of men, diftinguifhablc by peculiar features in the

B O o K constitution of their bodies, as well as in the

IV. charaderiftic qualities of their minds. Others

contend, that they are descended from some rem.
nant of the antediluvian inhabitants of the earth,
who survived the deluge, which swept away the
greatest part of the human species in the days of
Noah; and preposterously suppose rude, uncivi-
lized tribes, scattered over an uncultivated conti-
nent, to be the most ancient race of people on the
earth. There is hardly any nation from the north
to the south pole, to which forne antiquary, in
the extravagance of conjecture, has not afcrib.
ed the honor of peopling America. The Jews,
the Canaanites, the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians,
the Greeks, the Scythians in ancient times, are
supposed to have fettled in this western world.
The Chinese, the Swedes, the Norwegians, the
Welsh , the Spaniards, are said to have sent
colonies thither in later ages, at different periods,
and on various occasions. Zealous advocates
stand forth to support the refpedtive claims of
those people; and though they reft upon no
better foundation than the casual resemblance of
some customs , or the supposed affinity between
a few words in their different languages, much
erudition and more zeal have been employed, to
little purpose, in defence of the opposite systems.
Those regions of conjecture and controversy
belong not to the historian. His is a more limited
province, confined to what is established by
certain or highly probable evidence. Beyond this
I ihall not venture, in offering a few observations,

which may contribute to throw some light upon B o o
this curious and much agitated question. Iv.

I. There are authors who have endeavoured ought not
by mere conjectures to account for the peopling to he found.

ed on mere

of America. Some have supposed that it was conjeaure,
originally united to the ancient continent, and
disjoined from it by the shock of an earthquake+
or the irruption of a deluge. Others have imagin-
ed, that some vessel being forced from its course
by the violence of a westerly wind, might be
driven by accident towards the American coast,
and have given a beginning to population in
that desolate continent `'. But with refped to all
those systems, it is vain either to reason or inquire,
because it is impoflible to come to any decision.
Such events as they fuippofe are barely possible,
and may have happened. That they ever did
happen, we have no evidence, either from the
clear testimony of history, or from the obfcurc
intimations of tradition.

2. Nothing can be more frivolous or uncertain oronrerem-

than the attempts to discover the original of the blanceoe
Americans, merely by tracing the resemblance
between their manners and those of any particular
people in the ancient continent. If we suppose
two tribes, though placed in the molt remote
regions of the globe, to be in the fame state of

. o o iK society, and to resemble each other in the degree

Iv. of their improvement , they muff feel the fame

wants and exert the fame endeavours to supply them.
The fame objeds will allure, the fame paflions will
animate thein, and the fame ideas and sentiments will
arise in their minds. The character and occupations
of the hunter in America mufft be litte different from
those of an Asiatic, who depends for subsistence
on the chafe. A tribe of savages on the banks
of the Danube mufft nearly resemble one upon
the plains washed by the Miffifippi. Instead then
of presuming from this similarity, that there is any
affinity between them, we should only conclude,
that the disposition and manners of men are formed
by their situation, and arise from the state of
society in which they live. The moment that
begins to vary, the character of a people must
change. In proportion as it advances in improve-
ment, their manners refine, their powers and
talents are called forth. In every part of the earth
the progress of man hath been nearly the fame,
and we can trace him in his career from the rude
simplicity of savage life, until he attains the
industry, the arts, and the elegance of polifled
society. There is nothing wonderful then in the
similitude between the Americans and the bar-
barous nations of our continent. Had Lafitau,
Garciaand many otherauthors, attended to this, they
would not have perplexed a fubjecd which they
pretend to illustrate, by their fruitless endeavours
to eftablilh an affinity between various races of
people in the old and new continents, upon no

other evidence than such a resemblance in their n o o K
manners as necessarily arises from the similarity of Iv.
their condition. There are, it is true, among
every people, some customs, which, as they do
not flow from any natural want or desire peculiar
to their situation, may be denominated usages of
arbitrary institution. If between two nations fettled
in remote parts of the earth, a perfect agreement
with refped to any of these thould be discovered,
one might be led to fufpet that they were con-
nedted by some affinity. If, for example, a nation
were found in America that consecrated the
seventh day to religious worship and reft, we
might justly suppose that it had derived its know-
ledge of this usage,, which is of arbitrary inftitu-
tion, from the Jews. But, if in another nation,
the first appearance of every new moon was
celebrated with extraordinary feflivity, this month-
ly festival could be confidered as nothing more
than an expression of joy natural to man on the
return of the planet which guides and cheers him
in the night. The inflances of customs, merely
arbitrary, common to the inhabitants of both
hemispheres, are indeed, so few and so equivocal,
that no theory concerning the population of the
New World ought to be founded upon them.

3. The theories which have been formed with orofreligc

refped to the original of the Americans, from o"trites
observation of their religious rites and pradices,
are no less fanciful, and destitute of solid founda-
tion. When the religious opinions of any
people are neither the result of rational inquiry,

B o o K nor derived from the inftrudions of revelation,

Iv. they muff needs be wild and extravagant. Bar-

barous nations are incapable of the former, and
have not been blessed with the advantages arising
from the latter. Still, however, the human mind,
even where its operations appear most wild and
capricious, holds a course so regular, that in
every age and country the dominion of particular
passions will be attended with similar effeds. The
savage of Europe or America, when filled with
superstitious dread of invisible beings, or with
inquisitive solicitude to penetrate into the events
of futurity, trembles alike with fear, or glows
with impatience. He has recourse to rites and
practices of the fame kind, in order to avert the
vengeance which he fiuppofes to be impending
over him, or to divine the secret which is the
objet of his curiosity. Accordingly, the ritual of
superstition, in one continent, seems, in many
particulars, to be a transcript of that eftablifled in
the other, and both authorize similar institutions,
Sometimes so frivolous as to excite pity, fonietimes
so bloody and barbarous as to create horror. But
without supposing any consanguinity between
such distant nations , or imagining that their reli-
gious ceremonies were conveyed by tradition from
the one to the other, we may ascribe this unifor-
xmity, which in many instances seems very amaz-
ing, to the natural operation of superstition and
Â¢nthufiafin upon the weakness of the human
mind.

Not peopled 4. We may lay it down as a certain principle,
by any na.

in this inquiry, that America was not peopled by B o o i
any nation of the ancient continent, which had Iv.
made considerable progress in civilization. The tion highly
inhabitants of the New World were in a state of ivilied
society so extremely rude, as to be unacquainted
with those arts which are the first essays of human
ingenuity in its advance towards improvement.
Even the most cultivated nations of America were
firangers to many of those simple inventions, which
were almost coeval with society in other parts of
the world, and were known in the earliest periods
of civil life with which we have any acquaintance.
From this it is manifest, that the tribes which
originally migrated to America, came off from
nations which inuft have been no lets barbarous
than their posterity, at the time when they were
firlt discovered by the Europeans. For, although
the elegant and refined arts may decline or perish,
amidst the violent flocks of those revolutions and
disasters to which nations are exposed, the necessary
arts of life, when once they have been introduced
among any people, are never loft. None of the
vicissitudes in human allnirs affedt these, and they
continue to be pradifcd as long as the race of
men exists. If ever the lfe of iron had been known
to the savages of America, or to their progenitors,
if ever they had employed a plough, a loom, or
a forge, the utility of those inventions would
have prcferved them, and it is impollible that
they nlould have been abandoned or forgotten. WVe
may conclude then, that the Americans sprung
from some people, who were thenmlflves in such

B o o K an early and unimproved flage of society, as to

Iv. be unacquainted with all those necessary arts,

which continued to be unknown among their
poflerity, when first visited by the Spaniards.

norfrom the 5. It appears no less evident, that America was
fouithern re- not peopled by any colony from the more southern
gions of our b Te
contcnent. nations of the ancient continent. None of the rude

tribes fettled in that part of our hemisphere can be
supposed to have visited a country so remote. They
poleffeed neither enterprise, nor ingenuity, nor
power, that could prompt them to undertake, or
enable them to perform, such a diflant voyage.
That the more civilized nations in Asia or Africa
are not the progenitors of the Americans is manifest,
not only from the observations which I have already
made concerning their ignorance of the most simple
and necessary arts, but from an additional circum-
fiance. Whenever any people have experienced the
advantages which men enjoy, by their dominion
over the inferior animals, they can neither subsist
without the nourishment which there afford, nor
carry on any considerable operation independent
of their ministry and labor. Accordingly, the
firlt care of the Spaniards, when they fettled in
America, was to flock it with all the domestic
animals of lEurope; and if prior to them, the
Tyrians, the Carthaginians, the Chinese, or any
other polished people, had taken pofeffion of that
continent, we should have found there the animals
peculiar to those regions of the globe where they
were originally feated. In all America, however,
there is not one animal, tame or wild, which

properly belongs to the warnm, or even the more n o o .R
temperate countries of the ancient' continent, The IV.
camer, the dromedary, the horse, the cow, were
as much unknown in America, as the elephant
or the lion. From which it is obvious, that the
people who first fettled in the western world did
not issue from the countries where those animals
abound, and where men, from having been long
accustomed to their aid, would naturally confider
it, not only as beneficial, but as indispensably
necessary to the improvement, and even the
preservation, of civil society.

6. From confidering the animals with which The two

continents is towards the northern extremity of erttoch
both , and that there the communication was wards the
opened, and the intercourse carried on between north.
them. All the extensive countries in America
which lie within the tropics, or approach near
to them, are filled with indigenous animals of
various kinds, entirely different from those in the
corresponding regions of the ancient continent.
But the northern provinces of the New World
abound with many of the wild animals which are
common in such parts of our hemisphere as lie in
a similar situation. The bear, the wolf, the fox,
the hare, the deer, the roebuck, the elk, and
several other species frequent the forests of North
America, no less than those in the north of
Europe and Asia ". It seems to be evident then,

' lBuffon, Hilt. Nat. ix. p. 97, &c.

n. o o l that the two continents approach each other in

iv. this quarter, and are either united, or so nearly

adjacent, that these animals might pass from the
one to the other.

Thisafcer- 7. The adual vicinity of the two continents is
tained by iC. so clearly eftablifled by modern discoveries, that
tovery.

the chief difficulty with refped to the peopling
of America is removed. While those immense
regions, which firetch eastward from the river
Oby to the sea of Kamchatka were unknown, or
imperfectly explored, the north-east extremities of
our hemisphere were supposed to be so far distant
from any part of the New World, that it was not
easy to conceive how any communication should
have been carried on between them. But the
Ruffians, having fubjeded the western part of
Siberia to their empire, gradually extended their
knowledge of that vast country, by advancing
towards the east into unknown provinces. These
were discovered by hunters in their excursions
after game, or by soldiers employed in levying
the taxes, and the court of Ilofcow estimated
the importance of those countries only by the small
addition which they made to its revenue. At
length, Peter the Great arcended the Ruffian
throne. His enlightened, comprehensive mind, in-
tent upon every circumstance that could aggrandize
his empire, or render his reign illustrious, discerned
consequences of those discoveries, which had
escaped the obfcrvation of his ignorant predecefnbrs,
He perceived, that in proportion as the regions
of Asia extended towards the cast, they must

approachl

approach nearer to America; that the communi- B o o K
cation between the two continents, which had iv.
long been searched for in vain, would probably
be found in this quarter, and that. by opening, it,
fonie part of the wealth and commerce of the
weflern world might be. made to flow into his
dominions by a new channel. Such an objet suited
a genius that: delighted in grand schemes. Peter
drew up inftrudions with his own hand for prose-
cuting this deGign, and gave orders for carrying
it into execution

His successors adopted his ideas, and pursued
his plan. The officers whom the Ruffian court
employed in this service, had to struggle with so
many difficulties, that their progress was extremely
flow. E'ncouraged by some faint traditions among
the people of Siberia, concerning a successful
voyage in the year one tho.ofand fix hundred and
forty-eight, round the north.-ealt promontory of
Alri;,. they attempted to follow the fame courie.
Veffnls were fitted, out, with this view, at diffrcent
times, from the rivers Lena and Kolyma; but in
a frozen ocean, which nature seems not to have
(leftined for navigation, they were exposed to
many disasters,, without being able to accomplish
their purpose. No veflel fitted out by the Ruflian
courti ever doubled this formidable Cape 1; we
are indebted for what is known of those extreme
regions of Alia, to the discoveries made in excur.

B o O IK sions by land. In all those provinces an opinion

It. prevails, that there are countries of great extent

and fertility, which lie at no considerable distance
from their own coafis. These the Ruffians imagined
to be part of America; and several circumstances
concurred not only in confirming them in this
belief, but in persuading them that some portion
of that continent could not be very remote. Trees
of various kinds, unknown in those naked regions
of Asia, are driven upon the coast by an eafteily
wind. By the fame wind, floating ice is brought
thither in a few days; flights of birds arrive
annually from the fame quarter; and a tradition
obtains among the inhabitants, of an intercourse
formerly carried on with some countries situated
to the Salt.

After weighing all these particulars, and compar-

ing the position of the countries in Asia which
had been discovered, with such parts in the north.
weft of Amierica as were already known, the
Ruffian court formed a plan, which would have
hardly occurred to any nation less accultomed.to
engage in arduous undertakings, and to contend
with great dificulties. Orders were issued to build
two venels at the frmall village of Ochotz, situated
pn the Sea of Kamchatka, to fail on a voyage of
difcovcry. Though that dreary uncultivated region
furnished nothing that could be of use in conftrudt-
ing them, but some larch trees; though not only
the iron, the cord.ge , the fails, and all the
numerous articles requisite for their equipment,
but the provisions for victualling' tlcm, wcre to

down rix crs of difi(i ult navigation., and along Iv.
roads alinolt impassable, the mandate of the fover-
eigl, trind the perseverance of the people, at last
surmounted every obstacle. Two vessels were 174t.
finished, and, under the command of the captains June4.
Behring and Tfchirikow, failed from Kamchatka,
in qulft of the New AWorld, in a quarter where
it had never been approached. They flaped their
course towards the east; and though a storm soon
separated the vessels, which never rejoined, and
many disasters besel them, the expecations from
the voyage were not altogether frustrated. Each
of the commanders discovercd land, which to them
appeared to be part of the American continent;
and, according to their observations, it seems to
be situated within a few degrees of the north-west
coast of California. Each set some of his people
ashore; but in one place the inhabitants fled as
the Ruffians approached; in another, they carried
off those who landed, and destroyed their boats.
The violence of the weather, and the distress of
their crews, obliged both captains to quit this
inhospitable coast. In their return they touched at
several islands , which stretch in a chain from east
to weft between the country which they had
discovered and the coast of Alia. They had some
intercourse with the natives, who feerned to them
to resemble the North Americans. They presented
to the Ruffians the cablumit, or pipe of peace, which
is a symbol of friendfnip universal among the people

B o O of North America, and an usage of arbitrary infli.

IV. tution, peculiar to them.

Though the illands of this New Archipelago

have been frequented fince'that time by the Ruflian
hunters, the court of St. Peterfburgh, during a
period of more than forty years, seems to have
relinquished every thought of prosecuting difcove-
ries in that quarter. But in the year one thousand
seven hundlred and fixty-eight, it was unexpectedly
resumed. The Sovereign, who had been lately
feated on the throne of Peter the Great, possessed
the genius and talents of her illustrious predecessor.
During the operations of the most arduous and
extensive war in which the Ruflian empire was
ever engaged, flle formed schemes and executed
undertakings , to which, more limited abilities
would have been incapable of attending but amidfl
the leisure of pacific times. A new voyage of
difcovcry from the eastern extremity of Alia was
planned , and captain ireniktzin and lieutenant
Levafheit were appointed to command the two
vessels fitted out for that purpose. In their voyage

seven hundred and fixty-eight, it was unexpectedly
resumed. The Sovereign, who had been lately
feated on the throne of Peter the Great, pofeffed
the genius and talents of her illustrious predecessor.
During the operations of the most arduous and
extensive war in which the Ruffian empire was
ever engaged, flie formed schemes and executed
undertakings, to which more limited abilities
would have been incapable of attending but amidst
the leisure of pacific times. A new voyage of
difcovcry from the eaRern extremity of Asia was
planned , and captain Krektzin and lieutenant
Levafhieft were appointed to command the two
vessels fitted out for that purpose. In their voyage
outward they held nearly the fame course with
the former navigators, they touched at the fame

Thus'the poflibility of a communication between

the continents in this quarter refts no longer upon
nicre conjedure, but is eftablinfed by undoubted
evidence 36. Some tribe, or some families of wander-
ing Tartars, from the restless spirit peculiar to their
race, might migrate to the nearest islands, and,
rude as their knowledge of navigation was, might,
by pafling from one to the other, reach at length
the coast of America, and give a beginning to

the Marian or Ladrone islands and the nearest land

America which the Ruffians discovered, and the

of Greenland is separated from America by a very

land, their ancestors, as much addidced to roving
by sea, as the Tartars are to wandering by land,
might, at some more remote period, accomplish
the fame voyage, and fettle a colony there, whose
descendants might, in progress of time, migrate
into America. But if, instead of venturing to fail
diretly from their own coast to Greenland, we
suppose that the Norwegians held a more cautious
course, and advanced from Shetland to the Feroe
Islands, and from them to Iceland, in all which
they had planted colonies, their progress may have
been so gradual, that this navigation cannot be
confidered as either longer or more hazardous, than
those voyages which that hardy and enterprising
race of men is known'to have performed in every
age.

Prohably 8. Though it be pofible that America may have
peoped from received its first inhabitants from our continent,
the north-
eaf. either by the north-welt of Europe or the north east

of Asia, there seems to be good reason for fuppof-
ing that the progenitors of all the American nations,
from Cape Horn to the southern confines of Labra.
dor, migrated from the latter rather than the
former. The EfIuimaux are the only people in
America, who, in their asped or character, bear
any refcmblance to the northern Europeans. They
are manifestly a race of men, diftind from all the

nations of the American continent, in language, in n o o K
disposition, and in habits of life. Their original, 1v.
then, may warrantably be traced up to that source,
which I have pointed out. But, among all the
other inhabitants of America, there is such a
riking similitude in the form of their bodies, and
ihe qualities of their minds, that, notwithfiand-
ng the diversities occasioned by the influence of
limate, or unequal progress in improvement, we
uft pronounce them to be descended from one
burce. There may be a variety in the Thades,
ut we can every where trace the fame original
olor. Each tribe has something peculiar which
iftinguilhes it, but in all of them we discern
ertain features common to the whole race. It is
emarkable, that in every peculiarity, whether in
heir persons or dispositions, which charadterize
he Americans, they have some resemblance to the
ude tribes scattered over the north-east of Afa, but
Imoft none to the nations fettled in the northern
xtremities of Europe. We may, therefore, refer
hem to the former origin, and conclude that their
fiatic progenitors, having fettled in those parts
f America, where the Ruffians have discovered
he proximity of the two continents, spread
radually over' its various regions. This account
f the progress of population in America, coincides
with the traditions of the Mexicans concerning
heir own origin, which, imperfect as they are,
vcre preserved with more accuracy, and merit
reater credit, than those of any people in the
ecw World. According to them, their ancestors

B a o I came fiom a remote country, situated to the north,

Iv. weft of Mexico. The 1Mexicans point out their

various fturioni as they advanced from this, into
the interior provinces, and it is precifelv the fame
roite which they mulR have held, if they had
been emigrants from Alia. T'he Nlexicans, in
dcfcribing the appearance of their progenitors,
their manners, and habits of life at that periad,
exatly delineate those of the rinde Tartars, from
whom I suppose them to have sprung '.

Thus have I finishe(l a difquilition which has

been deemed of so much importance, that it
would have been improper to omit it in writing
the history of America. I have ventured to in
quire, but without prefLuming to d.ecide. Satisfied
with offering conjedures, I pretend not to eftab
lifh any fyltem. When an investigation is, from
its nature, so intricate and obscure, that it is

as well as inftrudive researches, which can oc- n o o
cupy the philosopher or hiflorian. In order to xV.
complete the history of the human mind, and
attain to a perfect knowledge of its nature and
operations, we must contemplate man in all those
various situations wherein he has been placed.
We must follow him in his progress through the
different stages of society, as he gradually advances
from the infant state of civil life towards its ma-
turity and decline. We must observe, at each
period, how the faculties of his understanding
unfold, we mufR attend to the efforts of his active
powers, watch the motions of affetion as they
rife in his brealt, and mark whither they tend,
and with what ardor they are exerted. The
philofophcrs and historians of ancient Greece and
Rome, our guides in this as well as every other
difquifitiori, had only a limited view of this sub,
je , as they had hardly any opportunity of
surveying man in his rudest and most early state.
In all those regions of the earth with which they
were well acquainted, civil society had made con,
fiderable advances, and nations had finiflhed a
good part of their career before they began to
observe them. The Scythians and Germans, the
rudest people of whom any ancient author has
transmitted to us an authentic account, possessed
flocks and herds, had acquired property of various
kinds, and, when compared with mankind in their
primitive slate, may be reckoned to have attained
to a great degree of civilization.

But the discovery of the New World enlarged

R O O J the sphere of contemplation, and presented na

iv. tions to our view, in flages of their progress

proved tran much less advanced than those wherein they have
in any part been observed in our continent. In America,

the sentiments and actions of human beings in
the infancy of social life, while they feel but im.
perfectly the force of its ties, and have scarcely
relinquished their native liberty. That state of
primeval simplicity, which was known in our
continent only by the fanciful description of poets,
really existed in the other. The greater part of it;
inhabitants were firangers to industry and labor,
ignorant of arts., imperfectly acquainted with the
nature of property, and enjoying almost without
reftridion or control the bleflings which flowed
spontaneously from the bounty of nature. There
were only two nations in this vast continent which
had emerged from this rude slate, and had made
any considerable progress in acquiring the ideas,
and adopting the institutions, which belong to
polifled societies. Their government and manners
will fall naturally under our review in relating the
difcovcry and conquest of the Mexican and Peru-
vian empires; and we fliall have there an oppor-
tlnity of contemplating the Americans in the Itate
of highcft improvement to which they ever attained.

these, though with some diversity in their cha- n o o K
racder, their manners, and institutions, the state -Iv.
of society was nearly similar, and so extremely
rude, that the denomination of Savage may be
applied to them all. In a general history of Ame-
ica, it would be highly improper to describe the
condition of each petty community, or to in-
vcftigate every minute circumstance which con-
tributes to form:the charater of its members. Such
an inquiry would lead to details of immeasurable
and tiresome extent. The qualities belonging to
the people of all the different tribes have such a
near resemblance, that they may be painted with
the fame features.- W'here any circumstances seem
to constitute a diversity in their charadcer and man-
ners worthy of attention, it will be sufficient to
point these out as they occur, and to inquire into
the causes of such peculiarities.

It is extremely difficult to procure satisfying and Difficulty of
authentic information concerning nations - while obtaini

informa-

tlhey remain uncivilized. To discover their true tion,
charader under this rude form, and to colled the
features by which they are diflinguifhed, requires
iln observer possessed of no less impartiality than
(lilccrnment. For, in every stage of society, the
faculties, the sentiments and desires of men are
so accommodated to their own state, that they
become standards of excellence to themselves, they
atTix the idea of perfection and happiness to those
attainments which resemble their own, and wherever
the objects and enjoyments to which they have
been accustomcd are wantio1g,, confidently pro-

o o K nounce a people to be barbarous and miferibl(
Iv. Hence the mutual contempt with vhich the men

bers of communities, unequal in their degrees o
improvement, regard each other. Polished na
tions, conscious of the advantages which the!
derive from their knowledge and arts, are apt te
view rude nations with peculiar scorn, and, ii
the pride of superiority, will hardly allow eithel
their occupations, their feelings, or their pleasures,
to be worthy of men. It has seldom been the lot
.of communities, in their early and unpolifhed
state, to fall under the observation of persons
endowed with force of mind fuperi0r to vulgar
prejudices, and capable of contemplating man,
under whatever afpeft he appears, with a candid
,and discerning eye.

rom the , The Spaniards, who first visited America, and
incapacity Who had opportunity of beholding its various
bferver, tribes, while entire and unfubdued, were f.r

from poffelfing the qualities requisite for observing
the striking fpedacle presented to their view.
Neither the age in which they lived , nor the
nation to which they belonged, had made such
progrcfs in true fcieince, as inspires enlarged and
liberal sentiments. The conquerors of the New
WVorld were mostly illiterate adventurers, destitute
of all the ideas which flould have directed them
in contemplating objedts, so extremely different
from those with which they were acquainted. Sur-
rounded continually vith danger, or .ruigglinlg
with haidflhips, they had little leisure, and less
sapacity, for any speculative inquiry. Eager to

ake possession of a country of such extent and B o o K
pulence, and happy in finding it occupied by Iv.
nhabitants so incapable to defend it, they hastily
ronounced them, to be a wretched order of nien
ormed merely for servitude; and were more emn
loyed in compulting the profits of their labor, than
n inquiring into the operations of their minds,
r the reasons of their customs and institutions,
'he persons who penetrated at subsequent periods
nto the interior provinces, to which the knowv-
edge and devastations of the first conquerors did
ot reach, were generally of a similar character;
brave and enterprising in a high degree, but so
uninformed as to be little qualified either for ob-
erving or describing what they beheld.
Not only the incapacity, but the prejudices of andtheir

the Spaniards, render their accounts of the people ptej"di"cs*
of America extremely defective. Soon after they
planted colonies in their new conquests, a difference
in opinion arose with refped to the treatment of
the natives. One party, solicitous to render their
servitude perpetual, represented them as a brutish,
obstinate race, incapable either of acquiring reli-
gious knowledge, or of being trained to the
funtions of sociAl life. The other, full of pious
concern for their conversion, contended that',
though rude and ignorant, they were gentle,
affcdtionate, docile, and by proper inftrudtions
and regulations Inight be formed gradually into
good Chriflians andt useful citizens. This contro-
verfy, as I have already related, was carried on
witli all the .warmth which is natural, whel

of the laity espoused the former opinion, all the
ecclesiastics were advocates for the latter; and we
ihall uniformly find that accordingly as an author
belonged to either of these parties, he is apt to
magnify the virtues or aggravate the defects of the
Americans far beyond truth. Those repugnant
accounts increase the difficulty of attaining a per.
fed knowledge of their character, and render it
necessary to peruse all the descriptions of them by
Spanish writers with distrust, and to receive their
information with some grains of allowance.

this new field of study with great ardor; but,

theories have been proposed with equal confidence
and uncommon powers of genius and eloquence
have been exerted, in order to clothe them with
an appearance of truth.

As all those circumfiances concur in rendering

an inquiry into the state of the rude nations in
America intricate and obscure, it is necelTary to
carry it on with caution. When guided in ou
researches by the intelligent observations of th
few philosophers Who have visited this part o
the globe, we may venture to decide. When
obliged to have recourse to the superficial remark
of vulgar travellers, of sailors, traders, bu
caneers, and missionaries, we must often pause
and comparing detached fads endeavour to di
cover what they wanted sagacity to observe, With
out indulging conjecure ~ or betraying a propenfit

food has been mentioned by many authors as a
confirmation of this suspicion. The quantity of
food which men consume varies according to the
temperature of the climate in which they live,
the degree of activity which they exert, and the
natural vigor of their conflitutions. Under the
enervating heat of the torrid zone, and when men
pass their days in indolence and ease, they require
less nourifhtnent than the adive inhabitants of
temperate or cold countries. But neither the warmth
of their climate , nor their extreme laziness, will ac.
count for the uncommcon defed of appetite among
the Americans. 'I he Spaniards were aftonified

to the charms of beauty, and the power of love.
That passion which was deffined to perpetuate
life, to be the bond of social union, and the
source of tenderness and joy," is the most ardent
in the human breast. Though the perils and hard-
ships of the savage state, though excessive fatigue,
on some occasions, and the difficulty at all times
of procuring fubfifience, may feemr to be adverse
to this passion, and to have a tendency to abate
its vigor, yet the rudefl nations in every other
part of the globe seem to feel its influence more
powerfully than the inhabitants of the New World.
The negro glows with all the warmth of desire
natural to his climate; and the most uncultivated
Asiatics discover that sensibility, which, from
their situation on the globe, we should expe&
them to have felt. But the Americans are, in an
amazing. degree, strangers to the force of this first
inftind of nature. In every part of the New World
the natives treat their women with coldness anSl
indifference. They are neither the objeds of that
tender attachment xvhich takes place. in civilized
society, nor of that ardent desire conspicuous
among rude nations. Even in climates where this.

in the confiitution of its inhabitants. They reft

a more simple (late, where the demands of men are
so few and so moderate, that they may be gratified,
almost without any effort, by the spontaneous

are not called forth, nor can they attain their
proper strength. The natives of Chili and of
North-America, the two temperate regions in the

an active and vigorous race, when compared with
the inhabitants of the ifes, or of those parts of
the continent where hardly any labor is requisite

are not, however, so regular, or so continued,
as those of persons employed in the culture of the

though his agility may be greater than theirs, his

B o o K strength is on the whole inferior. If another

iv. direction were given to the active powers of man

in the New World, and his force augmented
by exercise, he might acquire a degree of vigor
which he does not in his present slate possess. The
truth of this is confirmed by experience. Wherever
the Americans have been gradually accuf orned to
hard labor, their constitutions become robuit, and
they have been found capable of performing such
tasks, as seemed not only to exceed the powers
of such a feeble frame as has been deemed peculiar
to their country, but to equal any effort of the
natives, either of Africa or of Europe "

The fame reasoning will apply to what has

been observed concerning their slender demand
for food. As a proof that this should be ascribed
as much to their extreme indolence, and often
total want of occupition, as to any thing peculiar
in the phyficat flruture of their bodies, it has
been observed, that in those diltridts, where the
people of America are obliged to exert any unusual
effort of activity, in order to procure subsistence,
or wherever they are employer in severe labor,
their appetite is not inferior to that of other men,
and, in some places, it has struck observers as
remarkably voracious "'

The operation of political and moral causes is
still more conspicuous, in modifying the degree

Gumilla, ii. 12. 70. 217. Lafitau, i. SiC. Ovalle

of attachment between the sexes. In a state of i o o it
high civilization, this passion, inflamed by restraint, iv.
refined by delicacy, and cherished by fashion,
occupies and engrosses the heart. It is no longer
a simple inftindt of nature; sentiment heightens the
ardor of desire, and the most tender emotions of
which our frame is susceptible, sooth and agitate
the foul. This description, however, applies only
to those, who, by their situation, are exempted
from the cares and labors of life. Among persons
of inferior order, who are doomed by their con-
dition to incessant toil, the dominion of this paflion
is less violent; their solicitude to procure fibfiftence,
and to provide for the first demand of nature,
leaves little leisure for attending to its second call.
But if the nature of the intercourse between the
sexes varies so much in persons of different rank
in polished societies, the condition of man, while
he remains uncivilized, muff occasion a variation
still more apparent. We may well suppose, that
amidst the hardships, the dangers, and the fim.
plicity of ravage life, where subsistence is always
precarious, and often scanty, where men are almost
continually engaged in the pursuit of their enemies,
or in guarding against their attacks, and where
neither dress nor reserve are employed as arts of
female allurement, that the attention of the Ame-
ricans to their women would be extremely feeble,
without imputing this solely to any physical defed
or degradation in their frame.

It is accordingly observed, that in those countries,
of America, where, from the fertility of the foil,

IV. ces which the natives have made in improvement,

the means of subsistence are more abundant, and

grounds abounding so much with game, that they
have a regular and plentiful supply of nourilhment
with little labor. The superior degree of security
and influence which these tribes enjoy, is followed
by their natural effects. The palfions implanted
in the human frame by the hand of nature acquire
additional force; new taftes and desires are formed;
the women, as they are more valued and admired,
become more attentive to dress and ornament;
the men, beginning to feel how much of their
own happiness depends upon them, no longer
disdain the arts of winning their favor and
affedion. The intercourse of the sexes becomes
very different from that which takes place among
their ruder countrymen; and as hardly any restraint
is imposed on the gratification of desire, either by
religion, or laws, or decency, the dissolution of
their manners is excefiive ".

None of Notwithtanding the feeble make of the Ameri-
them d". cans, hardly any of them are deformed, or mutilated,

or defecive in any of their senses. All travellers

have been struck with this circumstance, and have B O o R
celebrated the uniform symmetry and perfection Iv.
of their external figure. Some authors search for
the cause of this appearance in their physical con-
dition. As the parents are not exhausted or over-
fatigued with hard labor, they suppose that their
children are born vigorous and found. They
imagine, that in the liberty of savage life, the
human body, naked and unconfined from its
earliest age, preserves its natural form; and that
all its limbs and members acquire a juster propor-
tion, than when fettered with artificial restraints,
which stint its growth, and distort its shape '
Something, without doubt, may be ascribed to
the operation of these causes; but the true reasons
of this apparent advantage, which is common to
all savage nations, lie deeper, and are closely
interwoven with the nature and genius of that
state. The infancy of man is so long and so help-
less, that it is extremely difficult to rear children
among rude nations. Their means of subsistence
are not only scanty, but precarious. Such as live
by hunting must range over extensive countries,
and flift often from place to place. The care of
children, as well as every other laborious task,
is devolved upon the women. The distresses and
hardflips of the savage life, which are often such
as can hardly be supported by persons in full
vigor, must be fatal to those of more tender age.

inhabitants, and they are restrained from laying Iv.
violent hands on their children, the Americans are
so far from being eminent for any superior per-
fcdtion in their form, that one should rather
fufped some peculiar imbecilJity in the race, from
the extraordinary number jos individuals who are
deformed, dwartifl, mutlated, blind, or deaf`.

How feeble soever the conflitution of the Uniformity

Americans may be, it is remarkable, that there otthir ap.
is less variety in the human form throughout the petra""
New World , than in the ancient continent. When
Columbus and the other discoverers first visited
the different countries of America which lie within
the torrid zone , they naturally expected to find
people of the fame complexion with those in the
corresponding regions of the other hemisphere. To
their amazement, however, they discovered that
America contained no negroes " ; and the cause
of this singular appearance became as much the
object of curiosity, as the fad itself was of wonder.
In what part or membrane of the body that humor
resides which tinges the complexion of the negro
with a deep black, it is the business of anatomists
to inquire and describe. The powerful operation
of heat appears manifeflly to be the cause which
produces this striking variety in the human species.
All Europe, almost the whole of Asia, and the
temperate parts of Africa, are occupied by men
of a fair complexion. All the torrid zone in Africa,

' Voyage de Ulloa, i. 2 :. " P, Martyr, dec. p. 7 1.

a o o K some of the warmer regions adjacent to it, and a

Iv. few countries in Asia, are filled with people of a

deep black color. If we trace the nations of our
continent, making our progress from cold and
temperate countries towards those parts which are
exposed to the influence of vehement and unre.
mitting heat, we shall find, that the extreme white.
ness of their skin soon begins to diminish ; that
its color deepens gradually as we advance, and
after passing through all the successive gradations
offhade, terminates in an uniform unvarying black.
But in America , where the agency of heat is
checked and abated by various causes, which I
have already explained , the climate seems to be
destitute of that force which produces such won.
derful effects on the human frame. The color of
the natives of the torrid zone, in America, is hardly
of a deeper hue than that of the people in the more
temperate parts of their continent. Accurate obfer.
vers, who had an opportunity of viewing the
Americans in very different climates, and in pro-
vinces far removed from each other, have been
firuck with the amazing similarity of their figure
and aspect '.

But though the hand of Nature has deviated so

little from one standard in fashioning the human
form in America, the creation of fancy hath been
various and extravagant. The fame fables that were
current in the ancient continent , have been revived

has been peopled with human beings of monflrous B o o
and fantaltic appearance. The inhabitants of certain IV.
provinces were described to be pigmies of three
feet high ; those of others to be giants of an enor-
mous lize. Some travellers published acounts of
people with only one eye, others pretended to
have discovered men without heads, whose eyes
anid mouths were planted in their breasts. The
variety of Nature in her productions is, indeed , so
great, that it is presumptuous to set bounds to her
fertility, and to reject indiscriminately every relation
that does not perfecly accord with our ownlimited
observation and experience. But the other extreme,
of yielding a hasty assent, on the slightest evidence,
to whatever has the appearance of being strange
and marvellous, is no less unbecoming a philofo-
phical inquirer, as, in every period, men are
more apt to be betrayed into error, by their weak-
ness in believing too much, than by their arrogance
ill believing too little. In proportion as science
extends, and nature is examined with a discerning
eye, the wonders which amused ages of ignorance
disappear. The tales of credulous travellers con-
cerning America areforgotten; the monsters which
they describe have been searched for in vain; and
those provinces where they pretend to have found
inhabitants of singular forms, are now known to
be possessed by people no wife different from the
other Americans.

Though those relations may, without discus-

sion, be rejected as fabulous, there are other
accounts of varieties in_ the human species in some

o o parts of the New World , which reft upon better
Iv. evidence, and merit more attentive examination

This variety has been particularly observed in threi
different diftrics. The first of these is situated ir
the isthmus of Darien, near the centre of America,
Lionel Wafer, a traveller poffelfed of more curiofit)
and intelligence than we should have expected tc
find in an associate of Buccaneers, discovered there
a race of men few in number, but of a fingulai
make. They are of low flature, according to hil
description, of a feeble frame, incapable of endurint
fatigue. Their color is a dead milk white; not
resembling that of fair people among Europeans
but without any tincture of a blush or fanguinm
complexion. Their skin is covered with a fine
hairy down of a chalky white , the hair of their
heads, their eye-brows, and eye-lashes, are ol
the fame hue. Their eyes are of a singular form,
and so weak, that they can hardly bear the light
of the fun ; but they fee clearly by moon - light,
and are most ative and gay in the night 67. No
race similar to this has been discovered in any
other part of America. Cortes, indeed, found some
persons exactly resembling the white people ol
Darien, among the rare and monstrous animals
which Montczuma had colleded `". But as the
power of the Mexican empire extended to the
provinces bordering on the iflhmus of Darien,
they were probably brought from thence. Singulai

ated breed, not a separate class of men; and from
me disease or defect of their parents, the peculiar
olor and debility which mark their degradation

has been observed, that neither the white people

IV. hitherto been produced. Though several persons,

towhofe testimony great refpet is due, have visiter
this part of America since the time of Magellan,
and have had interviews with the natives, though
some have affirmed, that such as they saw were o
gigantic flature, and others have formed the far
conclusion from measuring their footsteps, or from
viewing the skeletons of their dead; yet thei
accounts vary from each other in so many effenti
points, and are mingled with so many circumstance
manifestly false or fabulous, as detrad much fro

the other hemisphere, we should attend not only B o o M
to the make and vigor of their bodies, but con- Iv.
fider what degree of health they enjoy, and to
what period of longevity they usually arrive. In
the simplicity of the savage fate, when man is
not oppressed with labor, or enervated by luxury,
or disquieted with care, we are apt to imagine
that his life will flow on almost untroubled by
disease or suffering, until his days be terminated,
in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of
nature. lWe find, accordingly, among the Ame-
ricans, as well as among other rude people, per.
ifns,-whofe decrepit and flrivelled form seems
to indicate an extraordinary length of life. But
as most of them are unacquainted with the art of
numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what
is past, as they are improvident for what is to
come, it is impossible to ascertain their age, with
any degree of precision 7. It is evident, that
the period of their longevity mufft vary confider-
ably, according to the diversity of climates, and
their different modes of subsistence. They seem,
however, to be every where exempt from many
of the distempers which afflict polished nations.
None of the maladies, which are the immediate
otspring of luxury, ever visited them; and they
have no names in their languages by which to
dliftllgiffh this numerous train of adventitious

in his mode of life, more violent, and more fatal.
If luxury engenders and nourishes distempers of
one species, the rigor and distresses of savage life
bring on those of another. As men, in this state,
are wonderfully improvident, and their means of
subsistence precarious, they often pass from ex.
treme want to exuberant plenty, according to
the vicissitudes of fortune in the chafe, or in con.
sequence of the various degree of abundance
with which the earth affords to them its produc.
tions, in different seasons. Their inconsiderate
gluttony in the one situation, and their severe
abstinence in the other, are equally pernicious.
For, though the human constitution may be accufP
tomed by habit, like that of animals of prey, to
tolerate long famine, and then to gorge vora.
cioufly, it is not a little affeced by such sudden
and violent transitions. The strength and vigor
of savages are, at some seasons, impaired by
what they susser from scarcity of food; at others,
they are afflidted with disorders arising from in.
digestion and a superfluity of gross aliment. These
are so common, that they may be confidered
as the unavoidable consequence of their mode
of subsisting, and cut off considerable numbers in
the prime of life. They are likewise extremely
subjet to consumptions, to pleuritic, aflhmatic,

and paralytic disorders ', brought on by the im- B o o x
moderate hardships and fatigue which they endure iv.
in bunting and in war; or owing to the incle-
mency of the seasons to which they are continually
exposed. In the savage state, hardships and fatigue
violently afTault the constitution. In polished so.
cieties, intemperance undermines it. It is not easy
to determine which of them operates with mofi
fatal effelc, or tends most to abridge human life.
The influence of the former is certainly most
extensive. The pernicious consequences of luxury
reach only a few members in any community,
the distresses of savage life are felt by all. As far
as I can judge, after very minute inquiry, the
general period of human life is shorter among
savages, than in well-regulated and industrious
societies.

One dreadful malady, the severest scourge,
with which , in this life, offended Heaven chastens
the indulgence of criminal desire , seems to have
been peculiar to the Americans. By communicat-
ing it to their conquerors, they have not only
amply avenged their own wrongs, but by adding
this calamity to those which formerly embittered
humnan life, they have, perhaps, more than coun-
terbalanced all the benefits which Europe has
derived from the discovery of the New AVorld.

our attention is naturally turned towards the pow.
ers and qualities of their minds. As the indivi.
dual advances from the ignorance and imbecillity
of the infant state, to vigor and maturity of under.
sanding, something similar to this may be ob-
served in the progress of the species. With refped
to it, too, there is a period of infancy, during
which several powers of the mind are not unfolded
and all are feeble and defecive in their operation

" See NOTE XXIII.

In the early ages of society , while the condition B o O K
of man is simple and rude, his reason is but little IV.
exercised, and his. desires move within a very
narrow fpheie. Hence arise two remarkable cha-
radEeriftics of the human mind in this state. Its
intelletual powers are extremely limited; its emo-
tions and efforts are few and languid. Both these
distinctions are conspicuous among the rudest
and most unimproved of the American tribes, and
constitute a striking part of their description.

What, among polished nations, is called fpecu- Tntelleual

lative reasoning or research, is altogether unknown faculties
in the rude state of society, and never becomes v
the occupation or amusement of the human facul-
ties, until man be so far improved as to have
secured, with certainty the means of subsistence,
as well as the possession of leisure and tranquil-
lity. The thoughts and attention of a savage
are confined within the small circle of objects, im-
mediately conducive to his preservation or en-
joyment. Every thing beyond that, escapes his
observation, or is perfectly indifferent to him.
Like a mere animal, what is before his eyes inter-
efts and affects him; what is out of fight, or at
a distance, makes little imprellion ". There are
several people in America whose limited under-
flandings seem not to be capable of forming an
arrangement for futurity; neither their solicitude
nor their foresight extend so far. They follow
blindly the ilnpulfe of the appetite which they feel,

"Ulloa, Noticias Americ. 222.

n o o K but are entirely regardless of difRant consequences,

Iv. and even of those removed in the least degree

from immediate apprehension.. While they highly
prize such things as serve for present use, or mi.
nifter to present enjoyment, they set no value
upon those which are not the object of some im.
mediate want". When, on the approach of
the evening, a Caribbee feels himself disposed to
go to reft, no consideration will tempt him to
fell his hammoc. But, in thelmorning, when he
is sallying out to the business or paltime of the
day, he will part with it for the slightest toy that
catches his fancy ". At the close of winter, while
the impression of what he has suffered from the
rigor of the climate is fresh in the mind of the
North American, he sets himself with vigor to
prepare materials for ereding a comfortable hut
to protect him against the inclemency of the fuc-
ceeding season; but as soon as the weather be.
comes mild, he forgets what is pafl, abandons his
work, and never thinks of it more, until the re.
turn of cold compels him, when too late, to re.
fume it .

If in concerns the most interefling, and seem.

ingly the most simple, the reason of man , while
rude and deffitute of culture, differs so little from
the thoughtless levity of children, or the improvi-
dent inflind of animals, its exertions in other

diredcions cannot be very considerable. The objeds n o o ic
towards which reason turns, and the disquisitions Iv.
in which it engages, must depend upon the state
in which man is placed, and are suggested by his
necessities and desires. Disquisitions, which appear
the most necessary and important to men in one
state of society, never occur to those in another.
Among civilized nations, arithmetic, or the art
of numbering, is deemed an essential and element-
ary science, and in our continent, the invention
and use of it reaches back to a period so remote
as is beyond the knowledge of history. But among
savages, who have no property to estimate, no
hoarded treasures to count, no variety of objects
or multiplicity of ideas to enumerate, arithmetic
is a superfluous and useless art. Accordingly,
among some tribes in America it seems to be quite
unknown. There are many who cannot reckon
farther than three; and have no denomination to
distinguish any number above it ". Several can
proceed as far as ten, others to twenty. When
they would convey an idea of any number beyond
these, they point to the hair of their head, inti-
mating that it is equal to them, or with wonder
declare it to be so great that it cannot be reckon-
ed ". Not only the Americans , but all nations,
while extremely rude, seem to be unacquainted

N o o with the art of computation ". As soon, however,

Iv. as they acquire such acquaintance or connexion

with a variety of objects, that there is frequent
occasion to combine or divide them, their know.
ledge of numbers increases, so that the state of this
art among any people may be confidered as one
standard, by which to estimate the degree of their
improvement. The Iroquois, in North America,
as they are much more civilized than the rude in.
habitants of Brasil, Paraguay , or Guiana, have
likewise made greater advances in this refpeft;
though even their arithmetic does not extend
beyond a thousand, as in their petty transactions
they have no occasion for any higher number'.
The Cherokee , a less considerable nation on the
fame continent, can reckon only as far as a hun.
dred, and to that extent have names for the fe-
veral numbers; the smaller tribes in their neigh.
bourhood can rife no higher than ten '.

first ideas of every human being must be such as
he receives by the senses. But, in the mind of
man, while in the savage state, there seem to be
hardly any ideas but what enter by this avenue.

ards find) have not a word to express any thing
ut what is material or corporeal. Time, space,

cprefent abftraft and universal ideas, are altoge-

itself, instead of being an union of affeCtion and
interests between equals, becomes, among them,
the unnatural conjuntion of a master with his
slave. It is the observation of an author, whose
opinions are deservedly of great weight, that
wherever wives are purchased, their condition is
extremely depressed '. They become the pro
perty and the slaves of those who buy them. In
whatever part of the globe this custom prevails,
the observation holds. In countries where re.
finement has made some progress, women, when
purchased, are excluded from society, shut up in
sequestered apartments, and kept under the vigi.
lant guard of their masters. In ruder nations, they
are degraded to the meanest functions. Among
many people of America, the marriage-contrat is
properly a purchase. The man buys his wife of
her parents. Though unacquainted with the use
of money, or with such commercial tranfadtions
as take place in more improved society, he
knows how to give an equivalent for any objed
which he desires to possess. In some places, the
suitor devotes his service for a certain time to
the parents of the maid whom he courts; in
others, he hunts for them occasionally, or assists
-in cultivating their fields, and forming their ca.
noes; in others, he offers presents of such things
as are deemed molt valuable on account of their

eceives his wife; and this circumstance, added to Iv.
he low eflimation of women among savages, leads
iim to confider her as a female servant whom he
has purchased, and whom he has a title to treat as

he funtdions in domestic ceconomy, which fall
aturally to the share of women, are so many,
hat they are fubjeded to hard labor, and muff
ear more than their full portion of the common
urden. But in America their condition is so
eculiarly grievous, and their depression so
omplete, that servitude is a name too mild to
escribe their wretched state. A wife, among most
ribes, is no better than a beast of burden,
eftined to every office of labor and fatigue.
Vhile the men loiter out the day in sloth, or
pend it in amusement, the women are condemned
o incessant toil. Talks are imposed upon them
vithout pity, and services are received without
omplacency or gratitude ". Every circumrtance

and attachment to their offspring. They feel the
power of this infiint in its full force, and as long
as their progeny continue feeble and helpless, no
people exceed them in tenderness and care '. But
in rude nations, the dependence of children upon
their parents is of shorter continuance than in
polished societies. When men must be trained to
the various functions of civil life by previous
discipline and education, when the knowledge of
abstruse sciences muff be taught, and dexterity in
intricate arts must be acquired, before a young
man is prepared to begin his career of action, the
attentive feelings of a parent are not confined to
the years of infancy, but extend to what is more
remote, the establishment of his child in the world.
Even then, his solicitude does not terminate. His
protection may still be requisite, and his wisdom
and experience still prove useful guides. Thus a
permanent connexion is formed; parental tenderness
is exercised, and filial rcfped returned, throughout
the whole course of life. But in the simplicity
of the savage state, the affection of parents, like
the inftindtive fondness of animals, ceases almolt
entirely as soon as their offspring attain maturity.

Accordingly, the provision for fubfitence, arifi

the Americans, that, upon any accidental failu

their peculiar situation, led the islanders to depen
principally upon fishing for their subsistence"'. The
rivers, and the Lea with which they are furrounde

abounded in such numbers, that the natives coul
support themselves with a facility in which the

Without this, his dominion is incomplete. He is

reason was so little improved, or their union so
incomplete, that they seem not to have been
conscious of the superiority of their nature, and
suffered all the animal creation to retain its liberty,
without establishing their own authority over any

Want ofthe It is a doubtful point, whether the dominion
tfeul me- of man over the animal creation , or his acquiring

the use of metals, has contributed inoft to extend
his power. 'I he aera of this important'difcovery is
unknown, and in our hemisphere very remote.
It is only by tradition, or by digging up some
rude instruments of our forefathers, that we learn
that mankind were originally unacquainted with
the use of metals, and endeavoured to supply the
want of them by employing flints, shells, bones,
and other hard substances, for the fame purposes
which metals serve among polifhed.nations. Nature
completes the formation of some metals. Gold,
silver, and copper, are found in their perfect state,
in the clefts of rocks, in the fides of mountains, or
the channels of rivers. These were accordingly the
metals first known, and first applied to use. But
iron, the most serviceable of all, and to which
man is most indebted, is never discovered in its
perfect form; its gross and stubborn ore muff feel
twice the force of fire, and go through two
laborious processes, before it become fit for ure.
Man was long acquainted with the other metals,
before he acquired the art of fabricating iron, or
attained such ingenuity as to perfed an invention,
to which he wats indebted for those instruments
wherewith he fubducs the earth, and commands

all its inhabitants. But in this, as well as in many B o o K
other refpeds, the inferiority of the Americans was Iv.
conspicuous. All the savage tribes, scattered over
the continent and islands, were totally unacquainted
vith the metals which their foil produces in great
abundance, if we except some trifling quantity of
gold, which they picked up in the torrents that
descended from their mountains, and formed into
ornaments. Their devices to supply this want of
the serviceable metals, were extremely rude and
awkward. The most simple operation was to them
an undertaking of immense difficulty and labor.
To fell a tree with no other instruments than
hatchets of stone, was employment for a month "',
To form a canoe into shape, and to hollow it,
consumed years; and it frequently began to rot
before they were able to finish it"'. Their opera-
tions in agriculture were equally flow and defective.
In a country covered with woods of the hardest
timber, the clearing of a small field destined for
culture required the united efforts of a tribe, and
was a work of much time and great toil. This was
the business of the men, and their indolence was
satisfied with performing it in a very slovenly
manner. The labor of cultivation was left to the
women, who, after digging, or rather stirring the
field, with wooden mattocks, and flakes hardened
in the fire, sowed or planted it; but they were

Agricultur'e, even when the firength of man is

seconded by that of the animals which he has
filbjeded to the yoke, and his power augmented
by the use of the various instruments with which
the discovery of metals has furniThed him, is still
a work of great labor; and it is with the sweat
of his brow that he renders the earth fertile. It is

in occupation and in genius. They cannot form
into large communities, because it would be
impoflible to find subsistence; and they mull drive
to a diflance every rival who may encroach on
those domains, which they confider as their own.
This was the state of all the American tribes, the
numbers in each were inconsiderable, though
scattered over vast countries; they were far re-

dream of appropriating what is of small value, or

labor or danger of the chafe requires the united

Such was the form of political order established Tnwhat
among the greater part of the American nations. In people thorf

b*deicrip tiont

this state were almost all the tribes, spread over apply.
the vaSt provinces extending eastward of the Mif-
filippi, from the mouth of the St. Laurence to
the confines of Florida. In a similar condition were
the people of Brasil, the inhabitants of Chili, feve.
ral tribes in Paraguay and Guiana , and in the coun.
tries which stretch from the mouth of the Orinoco
to the peninsula of Yucatan. Among such an in-
finite number of petty associations, there may be pe.
culiarities which constitute a diftindion, and mark
the various degrees of their civilization and improve-
ment. But an attempt to trace and enumerate these
would be vain, as they have not been observed by
persons capable of discerning the minute and deli-
cate circumstances, which serve to discriminate na-
tions resembling one another in their general charac-
ter and features. The description which I have
given will apply, with little variation, to the policy
of every people in America , which has advanced
no farther in civilization, than to add rome slender
degree of agriculture to sithing and hunting.

Rude and imnperfed as thofc institutions may

appear, several tribes were not so far advanced in
their political progress. Among all those petty na-
tions which trusted for fubliftence entirely to filling

\ j

i o o K and hunting without any species of cultivation, the

iv. union was so incomplete, and their sense of mutual

dependence so feeble, that hardly any appearance
of government or order can be discerned in their
proceedings. Their wants are few, their objects of
pursuit simple, they form into separate tribes, and
a& together, from instinct, habit, or conveniency,
rather than from any formal concert and aflociation.
To this class belong the Californians , several of the
finall nations in the extenlive country of Paraguay,
some of the people on the banks of the Orinoco,
and on the river St. Magdalene, in the new
4kingdom of Granada 1".

Some irregu- But though among these las - mentioned tribes

ance s. and even among those which I fir[l described, its

authority is slender and confined within narrow
bounds, there were, however, some places in
America where government was carried far beyond
the degree of perfection which seems natural to rude
nations. In furseying the political operations of
man, either in his savage or civilized state, we dif.
cover lingular and eccentric institutions, which start
as it were from their station, and fly off so wide,
that we labor in vain to bring them within the general
laws of any fyfiem, or to account for them by those
principles which influence other communities in a
similar situation. Some inlsances of this occur
among those people of America, whom I have

These are so curious and important that I shall Iv.

There the mind, like the body, is firm and vigor-
ous. There men, conscious of their own dignity,
and capable of the greatest efforts in alerting it,
alpirc to independence, and their stubborn spirits
stoop with reluctance to the yoke of servitude. In
warmer climates, by whose influence the whole
frame is so much enervated, that present pleasure
is the supreme felicity, and mere repose is enjoy-
ment, men acquiesce, almost without a struggle,
in the dominion of a superior. Accordingly, if
we proceed from north to south along the conti-
nent of America, we fllall find the power of those
yeited with authority gradually increasing, and
the spirit of the people becoming more tame and
passive. In Florida, the authority of the sachems,
caziques, or chiefs, was not only permanent, but
hereditary. They were diflinguifhed by peculiar
ornaments, they enjoyed prerogatives of various
kinds, and were treated by their fubjec's with
that reverence, which people accuftored to sub-

a o o K a powerful tribe now extind, formerly situated

IV. on the banks of the Mliffifippi, a difference of

rank took place, with which the northern tribes
were altogether unacquainted. Some families were
reputed noble, and enjoyed hereditary dignity,I
The body of the people was confidered as vile,
and formed only for fubjedtion. This diftindion
was marked by appellations which intimated the
high elevation of the one state, and the igno-
minious depression of the other. The former were
called Rfpeieable; the latter, the Stinkaids. The
great Chief, in whom the supreme authority was
vested, is reputed to be a being of superior na-
ture, the brother of the Sun, the sole objec of their
worship. They approach this great Chief with re-
ligious veneration, and honor him as the repre,
tentative of their deity. His will is a law, to which
all submit with implicit obedience. The lives of
his fubjeds are so absolutely at his disposal, that if
any one has incurred his displeasure, the offender
comes with profound humility and offers him his
head. Nor does the dominion of the Chiefs end
with their lives; their principal officers, their fa.
vorite wives, together with many domestics of in.
ferior rank, are sacrificed at their tombs, that they
may be attended in the next world by the fame per.
sons who served them in this; and such is the reve.
rence in which they are held, that those victims
'welcome death with exultation, deeming it a
recompence of their fidelity, and a mark of di
tindtion, to be feleded to accompany their decease

master'". Thus a perfect despotism, with its full n 0 o0

train of superstition, arrogance, and cruelty, is Iv.
eltabliflhed among the Natchez, and by a singular
fatality, that people has tafted of the worfl cala-
mities incident to polished nations, though they
themselves are not far advanced beyond the tribes
around them in civility and improvement. In In the
Hispaniola, Cuba, and the larger islands, their 'iands"
caziques or chiefs possesed extensive power. The
dignity was transmitted by hereditary right from
father to son. Its honors and prerogatives were
considerable. Their fubjetds paid great refpecd to
the caziques, and executed their orders without
hesitation or reserve I'. They were distinguished
by peculiar ornaments, and in order to preserve
or augment the veneration of the people, they
had the address to call in the aid of superstition
to uphold their authority. They delivered their
mandates as the oracles of heaven, and pretended
to possess the power of regulating the, seasons
and of dispensing rain or sunshine, according as
their fubjeds flood in need of them.

In some parts of the continent, the power of the In Bogta.
caziques seems to have been as extensive as in the
ifes. In Bogota, which is now a province of the
new kingdom of Granada, there was fettled a
nation, more considerable in number and more
improved in the various arts of life, than any in

They lived in large towns. They were clothed
in a decent manner, and their houses may be
termed commodious, when compared with thole
of the small tribes around them. The effects of
this uncommon civilization were conspicuous.
Government had assumed a regular form. A jurid.
diction was eflablifhed, which took cognizance
of different crimes, and punifled them with rigor.
A diftincion of ranks was known; their chief, to
whom the Spaniards gave the title of monarch,
and who merited that name on account of his
splendor as well as power, reigned with absolute
authority. He was attended by officers of various
conditions; he never appeared in public without
a numerous retinue; he was carried in a fort of
palanquin with much pomp, and harbingers went
before him to sweep the road and stre,w it with
flowers. This uncommon pomp was supported
by presents or taxes received from his fubjeds,
to whom their prince was such an object of
veneration, that none of them presumed to look
him diredcly in the face, or ever approached him
but with an averted countenance ". There were

though far less advanced than the people of Bogota Iv.
in their progress towards refinement, the freedom
and independence, natural to man in his savage
tate, was much abridged, and their caziques had
assumed extensive authority.

It is not easy to point out the circumstances, or cauresof
o discover the causes which contributed to introduce those irregu

lar appeRr-

nd establish among each of those people a form of ances.
overnment so different from that of the tribes
round them, and so repugnant to the genius of
ude nations. If the persons who had an opportu-
it)' of observing them in their original state, had
een more attentive and more discerning, we might
ave received information from their conquerors
ufficient to guide us in this inquiry. If the tranfac.
ions of people, unacquainted with the use of let.
ers, were not involved in impenetrable obscurity,
Â·e might have derived some information from this
omeffic source. But as nothing fatisfadory cal
e gathered, either from the accounts of the Spa-
iards, or from their own traditions, we must have
ecourfe to conjectures, in order to explain the irre-

rlar appearances in the political state of the people
lioin 1 have mentioned. As all thole tribes which
3td loft their native liberty and independence were
cated in the Torrid Zone, or in countries approach-
ng to it, the climate may be supposed to have had
me influence in forming their minds to that fervi-
ude, which seems to be the defliny of man in
hofc regions of the globe. But though the in-
uen)ce of climate, more powerful than that of

B 0 0 K any other natural cause, is not to be overlooked;

IV. that alone cannot be admitted as a solution of the

point in question. The operations of men are so
complex, that we mull not attribute the form
which they assume, to the force of a single prin.
ciple or cause. Although despotism be confined
in America to the Torrid Zone, and to the warm
regions bordering upon it, I have already observed
that these countries contain various tribes, foirn
of which possess a high degree of freedom, and
others are altogether unacquainted with the re.
itraints of government. The indolence and tirn
dity peculiar to the inhabitants of the islands,
rendered them so incapable of the fentimeats oi
efforts necessary for maintaining independence, thal
there is no occasion to search for any other cauf

The fubjedcion of the Natchez, and of the peopll

so obsequious, or the power of rulers so unt

igor and independence subdued. Whoever can
quire the diredion of this formidable engine, is
cure of dominion over his species. Unfortunately

finquiry, this power was in the hands of their

generous or manly exertion "". But when we reflect
that many of these tribes, on occasions which call
for extraordinary efforts, not only defend themselves
with obstinate resolution, but attack their enemies
with the mofi daring courage, and that they
possess fortitude of mind superior to the sense of
danger or the fear of death, we must ascribe
their habitual caution to some other cause than
constitutional timidity ". T'he number of men in
each tribe is so finall, the difficulty of rearing new

extremely precious, and the preservation of it

American tribes as among the powerful nations

must have been ruined by maxims so ill adapted
to their condition. But wherever their communities

in such numerous bodies, as deserve the name of

engage in regular battles, and maintain the conflict
witl that desperate ferocity, which is natural to
men, who, having no idea of war but that of
exterminating their enemies, never give or take
quarter '". In the powerful empires of Mexico
and Peru, great armies were assembled, frequent
battles were fought, and the theory as well as
practice of war were different from what took place
in those petty Societies which assume the name of

gree of address in concealing their own motions,
and in discovering those of an enemy, yet it is re-
markable that, when they take the field in parties,
they can seldom be brought to observe the pre-
cautions most essential to their own security. Such
is the difficulty of accustoming savages to fubor-
dination, or to ad in concert; such is their impa-
tience under rcftraint, and such their caprice and
prefumrption, that it is rarely they can be brought

voked one of his tormentors to wound him with
a knife, "forbear these flabs of your knife, and

nvite it to " eat broth made of the flesh of their

f it may be discovered among the more mild

As the constancy of every American warrior may
e put to such severe proof, the great objet of mi.
tary education and discipline in the New World
to form the mind to fultain it. When nations
rry on war with open force, defy their enemies
the combat, and vanquish them by the fupe-
ority of their skill or courage, soldiers are trained
be active, vigorous, and enterprising. But in
merica, where the genius and maxims of war
e extremely different, paflive fortitude is the
uality in highest estimation. Accordingly, it is
rly the fiudy of tie Americans to acquire senti-
ents and habits, which will enable them to behave
ke men, when their resolution shall be put to the
roof. As the youth of other nations exercise them-
Ives in feats of activity and force, those of Ame-
cavie with one another in exhibitions of their pa-
ence under sufferings. They harden their nerves
y thoe voluntary trials, and gradualiy accustom
emfelves to endure the fh;rpeft pain, without

a'ry in America, when a youth is admitted into tht
class of warriors, or when a warrior is promoted
to the dignity of captain or chief, are accomro
dated to this idea of manliness. They are not dif
plays of valor, but of patience; they are not ex
hibitions of their ability to offend, but of their ca
pacity to susser. Among the tribes on the bank
of the Orinoco, if a warrior aspires to the ranko
captain, his probation begins with a long fast, mor
rigid than any ever observed by the most abfe
mious hermit. At the close of this, the chiefs at
femble, each givcs him three lafles with a large
whip, applied so vigorously, that his body isal
most flayed, and if he betrays the least fympton
of impatience or even sensibility, he is disgraced so
ever, and rejeted as unworthy of the honor
which he aspires. After some interval, the co
Rtancy of'the candidate is proved by a more excru
tiating trial. He is laid in a hammoc with hi
hands bound fast, and an innumerable multitudeo
venomous ants, vhofc bite occasions cxquifite pain
and produces a violent inflammation, are thrown
itpon him. The judges of his merit stand aroun
the hammoc, and , while these cruel infects fafte
upon the molt sensible parts of his body, a figlhr
groan, an involuntary motion exprcflive of wvha
he suffers, would exclude him for ever from th
rank of captain. Even after this evidence of hi

ortitude, it is not deemed to be completely afcer- B o o
ained, but muff stand another test more dreadful Iv.
han ally he has hitherto undergone. He is again
ufpended in his hammoc, and oovered with leaves
f the palmetto. A fire of itinking herbs is kin^
led underneath, so as he may feel its heat, and be
nvolved in its fimoke. Though scorched and al-
oft suffocated, he mufl continue to endure with
he fame patient insensibility. Many perifl in this
ude essay of their firmness and courage, but such
sgo through it with applause, receive the ensigns
f their new dignity with much solemnity, and are
ver after regarded as leaders of approved refolu-
ion, whose behaviour, in the most trying fitua-
ions, will do honor to their country '. In North-
inerica, the previous trial of a warrior is neither
b formal, nor so severe. Though even there, be.
ore a youth is permitted to bear arms, his patience
nd fortitude are proved by blows, by fire, and by.
nfults, more intolerable to a haughty spirit than
oth ''.
The amazing fleadinefs with which the Ame-
icans endure the most exquisite torments, has in-
uced some authors to suppose that, from the pe-
uliar feebleness of their frame, their sensibility is
ot so acute as that of other people; as women,
nd persons of a relaxed habit, are observed to be
ess assaded with pain than robult men, whose
cives are more firmly braced. But the constitution

cies, as to account for this diversity in their beha.
viour. It flows from a principle of honor, in.
stilled early and cultivated with such care, as to
inspire man in his rudest state with a heroic mag.
nanimity, to which philosophy hath endeavoured,
in vain, to form him, when more highly improved
and polished. This invincible constancy he has
been taught to confider as the chief diftintion of
a man, and the highest attainment of a warrior.
The ideas which influence his conduct, and the
paflions which take possession of his heart, are
few. They operate of course with more decisive
effect, than when the mind is crowded with a mul.
tiplicity of objects, or distracted by the variety of
its pursuits; and when every motive that ads
with any force in forming the sentiments of a fa.
vage, prompts him to susser with dignity, he will
bear what might seem to be impossible for human
patience to sustain. But wherever the fortitude of
the Americans is not roused to exertion by their
ideas of honor, their feelings of pain are the
fame with those of the reft of mankind ''. Nor
is that patience under sufferings for which the
Americans have been so justly celebrated, an uni.
versal attainment. The constancy of many of the

to please, or to appear beautiful, than to givea

the chief inconveniencies of their climate, which is

attention ot a fa. ag e, is to prepare some habitation
which may afford him flielter by day, and a retreat
at night. Whatever is connedted with his ideas o
perlonal dignity, whatever bears any referenceto
his military character, the savage warrior deemsao
object of importance. Whatever relates only to
peaceable and inactive life, he views with indiffe.
ence. Hence, though finically attentive to dress,
he is little solicitous about the elegance or difpG
fition of his habitation. Savage nations, far from
that slate of improvement, in which the mode of
living is confidered as a mark of dillindlion, and
unacquainted with those wants, which require
variety of accommodation, regulate the conflrudion
of their houses according to their limited ideas ol
necessity. Some of the American tribes were fc
extremely rude, and had advanced so little beyond
the primeval simplicity of nature, that they hai
no houses at all. During the day, they take fhelte

o fixed abode, and roam through the forest in quest
fgame, sojourn in temporary huts, which they
reCt with little labor, and abandon without any
oncern. The inhabitants of those vast plains,
vhich are deluged by the overflowing of rivers
uring the heavy rains that fall periodically between
he tropics , raise houses upon piles faflened in the
round, or place them among the boughs of trees,

he firll essays of the rudest Americans towards
roviding themselves with habitations. But even
mong tribes which are more improved, and whose
efidence is become altogether fixed, the ftrudture
f their houses is extremely mean and simple. They
re wretched huts, sometimes of an oblong and
rmetimes of a circular form, intended merely for
elter, with no view to elegance, and little
ttention to conveniency. The doors are so low,
hat it is necessary to bend or to creep on the hands
nd feet in order to enter them. They are without
indows , and have a large hole in the middle of

B o O i history, but would be foreign to the object of my

IV. researches. One circumstance merits attention, as

it is singular, and illustrates the character of the
people. Some of their houses are so large as to
contain accommodation for fourscore or a hundred
persons. These are built for the reception of dif.
ferent families, which dwell together under the
fame roof '1, and often around a common fire,
without separate apartments , or any kind of screen
or partition between the spaces which they refpec.
tively occupy. As soon as men have acquired
distinct ideas of property; or when they are so
much attached to their females, as to watch them
with care and jealousy ; farmilies of course divide
and fettle in separate houses, where they can secure
and guard whatever they wiflI to preserve. This
singular mode of habitation among several people
of America, may therefore be confidered not only
as the effec of their imperfect notions concerning
property , but as a proof of inattention and indif.
ference towards their women. If they had not
been accustomed to perfect equality, such an arrange-
ment could not have taken place. If their sensibility
had been apt to have taken alarm, they would not
have trusted the virtue of their women amidst the
temptations and opportunities of such a promif.
cuous intercourse. At the fame time, the perpetual
concord which reigns in habitations where so many
families ire crowded together, is surprising , and
affords a striking evidence that they must be people

After making some provision for his dress and Theirarns

habitation, a favlge will perceive the neceflity of
prcparing proper arms with which to afault or
repel an enemy. This, accordingly, has early exer-
cifed the ingenuity and invention of all rude nations.
The first offensive weapons were doubtless such
as chance presented , and the firlt efforts of art to
improve upon there, were extremely awkward and
simple. Clubs made of some heavy wood, stakes
hardened in the fire, lances whose heads were
armed with flint or the bones of some animal, are
weapons known to the rudest nations. All these,
however, were of use only in close encounter.
But men wished to annoy their enemies while at a
distance, and the bow and arrow is the moRt
early invention for this purpose. This weapon is
in the hands of people , whose advances in im-
provement are extremely inconsiderable, and is
familiar to the inhabitants of every quarter of the
globe. It is remarkable, however, that some tribes
in America were so destitute of art and ingenuity,
that they had not attained to the discovery of
this simple invention ", and seem to have been
unacquainted with the use of any missive weapon.

IV. complex than the bow, and among many nations of

equal antiquity , was little known to the people
of North America 8, or the islands, but appears
to have been used by a few tribes in the southern
continent 2'. The people, in some provinces of
Chili, and those of Patagonia, towards the fou.
them extremity of America, use a weapon peculiar
to themselves. They fasten flones, about the size
of a lift, to each end of a leather thong of eight
feet in length , and swinging these round their
heads, throw them with fiich dexterity, that they
feldon miss the objed at which they aim *.

invention 2r, as well as induRtry, were naturally
directed towards these objects. With refped to
every thing else, their wants and desires were so
limited, that their invention was not upon the
firetch. As their food and habitations are perfectly
simple, their domestic utensils are few and rude.
Some of the southern tribes had discovered the
art of forming vcffels of earthen ware, and baking
them in the fun, so as they could endure the fire.
In Northl-America , they hollowed a piece of hard
wood into the form of a kettle, and filling it
with water, brought it to boil by putting red.hot

fliould be capable of tracing with accuracy the

lie fiould rife from the contemplation of the one
to the knowledge of the other, and form just
conceptions of a Deity, as the Creator and Governor
of the universe. The idea of creation is so fami-
liar wherever the mind is enlarged by science, and
illuminated with revelation, that we seldom reflect
how profound and abstruse this idea is, or confider
what progress man must have made in observation
and research, before he could arrive at any know-
ledge of this elementary principle in religion.
Accordingly, several tribes have been discovered
in America , which have no idea whatever of a
Supreme Being, and no rites of religious worflip.

to reflect either upon what they themselves are,
or to inquire who is the author of their exist-

like the animals round tlhem, without knowledge or
vencration of any fiiperior power. Some rude tribes
have not in their language any name for the Deity,
nor have the most accurate observers been able to

to inmply that they rccognifed his authority, or

state of nature, and while their intellectual faculties
are so feeble and limited as hardly to elevate them
above the irrational creation , that we discover this
total insensibility to the imprefflons of any invisible
power.

But the human mind, formed for religion,i

soon opens to the reception of ideas, which are
destined, when correted and refined, to be the
great source of consolation amidst the calamities of
life. Among some of the American tribes, still
in the infancy of improvement, we discern appre.
henfions of some invisible and powerful beings.
These apprehensions are originally indiftindt and!
perplexed, and seem to be suggested rather by
the dread of impending evils, than to flow from
gratitude for blessings received. While Nature
holds on her course with uniform and undisturbed
regularity, men eljoy the benefits resulting from
it, without inquiring concerning its cause. But
every deviation from this regular course rouses
and astonishes them. When they behold evenu

to which they are not accustomed, they search n o O
for the reasons of them with eager curiosity. Their 1v.
underfianding is unable to penetrate into these;
but imagination, a more forward and ardent
faculty of the mind , decides without hesitation.
It ascribes the extraordinary occurrences in nature
to the influence of invisible beings, and supposes
that the thunder, the hurricane, and the earth-
quake, are effets of their interposition. Some
such confused notion of spiritual or invisible power,
ftperintending over those natural calamities which
frequently desolate the earth, and terrify its inha-
bitants, may be traced among many rude nations 45.
But besides this, the disasters and dangers of
savage life are so many, and men often find them-
selves in situations so formidable, that the m.ind,
sensible of its own weakness, has no resource but
in the guidance and protecion of wiflom and
power superior to what is human. Dejeded with
calamities which oppress him, and exposed to
dangers which he cannot repel, the savage no
longer relies upon himself; he feels his own im-
potence, and fees no profpedt of beingextricated,
hut by the interposition of some unseen arm.
Hence, in all unenlightened nations, the first
rites or pracdices which bear any resemblance
to acds of religion, have it for their objeA to
avert evils which men susser or dread, The

The Cermis of the islanders were reputed by them to
be the authors of every calamity that affliets the
human race; they were represented under the molt
frightfLl forms , and religious homage was paid
to them wvith no other view than to appease these
furious deities l'. Even among those tribes whose
religious system was more enlarged, and who had
formed some conception of benevolent beings,which
delighted in conferring benefits, as well as of ma.
licious powers prone, to inflict evil; fuperltition
still appears as the offspring of fear, and all its
efforts were employed to avert calamities. They
were persuaded that their good deities, prompted
by the beneficence of their nature, would beftosv
every blessing in their power, without solicitation
or acknowledgment; and their only anxiety was
to soothe and deprecate the wrath of the powers
whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind"'.

Such were the imperfect conceptions of the

ftheir divinity. Ministers were appointed to watch B o o it

e great chief of the nation, every morning, was
n ad of obeisance to the Sun; and festivals re-
rned at stated seasons, which were celebrated by
e whole community with solemn but unbloody
ites ". This is the most refined species of super-
ition known in America, and, perhaps, one of
ie most natural as well as most seducing. The
un is the apparent source of the joy, fertility,
nd life , diffused through nature; and while the
uman mind, in its early essays towards inquiry,
onteimplates and admires his universal and ani-
ating energy, its admiration is apt to flop fliort
what is visible, without reaching to the unseen
aufe; and pays that adoration to the most glo-
ous and beneficial work of God, which is due
nly to him who formed it. As fire is the purest
nd most acive of the elements, and in some of
squalities and effecs resembles the Sun, it was,
ot improperly, chosen to be the emblem of his
owerful operation. The ancient Persians, a
cople far superior, in every refpedt, to that rude
ibe whose rites I am describing, founded their
ligious system on similar principles, and eftab-
lhed a form of public worship, less grofsand
xceptionable than that of any people destitute of

which occur in the history of human affairs.

Among the people of Bogota, the Sun an

Moon were, likewise, the chief objects of vent
ration. Their system of religion was more regula
and complete , though less pure, than that of th
Natchez. They had temples , altars, priests, f2
crifices, and that long train of ceremonies, whic

imputed the origin of diseases to fupernaturali

mysterious rites, which they gave out to be

All their dances are imitations of some adcion; B o
ad though the music by which they are regulated iv,
extremely simple and tirefore to the ear by
ts dull monotony, some of their dances appear
wonderfully expressive and animated. The war-
ance is, perhaps, the most striking. It is the
eprefentation of a complete American campaign.
he departure of the warriors from their village,
heir march into the enemy's country, the caution
ith which they encamp, the address with which
hey Ration some of their party in ambush, the
anner of surprising the enemy, the noise and
erocity of the combat, the scalping of those who
re slain, the seizing of prisoners, the triumphant
eturn of the conquerors, and the torture of the
icrims, are successively exhibited. The performers
nter with such enthusiastic ardor into their several
arts, their gestures, their countenance, their voice,
re so wild and so well adapted to their various
tuations, that Europeans can hardly believe it to
a mimic scene, or view it without emotions of
ar and horror ".
But however expressive some of the American
ances may be, there is one circumstance in them
markable, and connected with the character of

nimate their hearts, are often adapted to display
excite that sensibility which mutually attaches

of feflivity and joy, and as rude nations are strange
to delicacy, and unaccustomed to disguise an
emotion of their minds, their dances are oft
extremely wanton and indecent. Such is
Calenda , of which the natives of Africa are
passionately fond "'; and such the feats of t
dancing girls, which the Asiatics contemplate wi
so much avidity of desire. But, among the Ame
cans, more cold and indifferent to their femal
from causes which I have already explained, i
passion of love mingles but little with their feftiva

and for From causes similar to those which render them
drinking, fond of play, the Americans are extremely addided

to drunkenness. It seems to have been one of the
firlt exertions of human ingenuity to discover sorn
composition of an intoxicating quality; and there
is hardly any nation so rude, or so destitute o
invention, as not to have succeeded in this fata
research. The molt barbarous of the America
tribes have been so unfortunate as to attain thi
art; and even those which are so deficient in
knowledge, as to be unacquainted with the method
of giving an inebriating strength to liquors by
fermentation, can accomplish the fame end byothe
means. The people of the islands, of North
America, and of California, used, for this purpose
the smoke of tobacco,.drawn up with a certai
inftrurent into the nostrils, the fumes of whic
ascending to the brain, they felt all the tranfpor
and frenzy of intoxication "'. In almost ever
other part of the New World, the natives pofeffei
the art of extracting an intoxicating liquor fro
maize or the manioc root, the fame substance
which they convert into bread. The operatio
by which they effect this, nearly resembles th
common one of brewing, but with this difference
that in place of yeft, they use a nauseous infuflo

fa certain quantity of maize or manioc chewed B o o
y their women. The saliva excites a vigorous iv.
rmentation, and in a few days the liquor becomes
tfor drinking. It is not disagreeable to the taste,
nd when swallowed in large quantities, is of an
toxicating quality '. This is the general bever-
e of the Americans, which they diflinguifh by
arious names, and for which they feel, such a
iolent and insatiable desire, as it is not easy
ither to conceive or describe. Among polished
ations, where a succession of various functions
nd amusements keeps the mind in continual
ccupation, the desire for strong drink is regulated,
a great measure, by the climate, and increases
rdiminifhes according to the variations of its.
mperature. In warm regions, the delicate and
nfible frame of the inhabitants does not require
e stimulation of fermented liquors. In colder
untries, tWe conflitution of the natives, more
bus and more sluggish, stands in need of generous
quors to quicken and animate it. But among
vages, the desire of something that is of power to
toxicate, is in every situation the fame. All the
eople of America , if we except some small tribes
car the Straits of Magellan, whether natives of the
rrid zone,or inhabitants of its nore temperate re-
ions, or placed by a harder fate in the severe climates
owards its northern or southern extremity, appear

of some moral cause, an4 cannot be confidered a
the effect of any physical or constitutional want,
While engaged in war or in the chafe, the savage
is often in the most interesting situations, and al
the powers of his nature are routed to the inof
vigorous exertions. But those animating scenes are
fLicceeclcd by long intervals of repose, during
which the warrior meets with nothing that he deems
of sufficient dignity or importance to merit his
attention. He languishes and mopes in this season
of indolence. The posture of his body is an emblem
of the state of his mind. In one climate, cowering
over the fire in his cabin ; in another, stretched
under the slade of some tree, he doses away his
time in sleep, or in an unthinking joyless inacivity,
not far removed from it. As strong liquors awake
him from this torpid state, give a brisker motion
to his spirits, and enliven him more thoroughly
than either dancing or' gaming, his love of them
is excessive, A savage, when not engaged in
acion, is a pensive melancholy animal; but as
soon as he taftes, or has a profped of tafting, the
intoxicating draught, he becomes gay and frolick-

re not accustomed to restrain any appetite, they
t no bounds to this. The riot often continues
ithout intermission several days; and whatever
ay be the fatal effecs of their excess, they never
afe from drinking as long as one drop of
quor remains. The persons of greatest eminence,

oft renowned for their wisdom, have no greater
ommand of themselves than the molf obscure

this standard, we fllall find, according to an ol
servation which I have already made, that thei
telledual powers of man must be extremely limit(
in their operations. They are confined within tl
narrow sphere of what he deems necessary for fu
plying his own wants. Whatever has not so"
relation to there, neither attracts his'attentior
nor is the object of his inquiries. But howev
narrow the bounds may be within which t

nowledge of a savage is circumscribed , he B o o K
offeffes thoroughly that small portion which he Iv.
as attained. It was not communicated to him by
rmal inftrution; he does not attend to it as a
atter of mere speculation and curiosity; it is the
iult of his own observation, the fruit of his own
xperience, and accommodated to his condition
d exigencies. While employed in the acdive
cupations of war or of hunting , he often finds
mfelf in difficult and perilous situations, from
hich the efforts of his own sagacity muff extricate
m. He is frequently engaged in measures, where
very fep depends upon his own ability to decide,
here he must rely solely upon his own penetra-
on to discern the dangers to which he is exposed,
nd upon his own wisdom in providing against
hem. In consequence of this, he feels the know-
dge which he possesses, and the efforts which
e makes, and either in deliberation or action
ts on himself alone.
As the talents of individuals are exercised and Politicaltao
proved by such exertions, much political wis- le'nt
m is said to be displayed in conducting the
irs of their small communities. The council of
Id men in an American tribe, deliberating upon
tsinterefts, and determining with refpedt to peace
war, has been compared to the senate in more
Olifhed republics. The proceedings of the for-
er, we are told, are often no less formal and fa-
aious than those of the latter. Great political
ifdom is exhibited in pondering the various
easures proposed, and in balancing their probable

I o o Iz advantages, against the evils of which they ma

lv. be produdive. Much address and eloquence ai

employed by the leaders,'who aspire at acquirin
such confidence with their countrymen, as to ha

savage tribes, the field for displaying politic
talents cannot be extensive. Where the idea
private property is incomplete, and no crimin
jurifdidion is eflablifhed, there is hardly any ftn,
tion of internal government to exercise. WVhe
there is no commerce, and scarcely any intercour
among separate tribes ; where enmity is implacabl
and hostilities are carried on alrhoft without inte
mission; there will be few points of public concer
to adjust with their neighbours; and that depar
ment of their affairs which may be denominate
foreign, callnot be so intricate as to requir
any refined policy in condudting it. Wher
individuals are so thoughtless and improvider
as seldom to take effectual precautions for fel
prefervatiol , it is vain to expedt that publi
measures and deliberations will be regulated b
the contemplation of remote events. It is tl
genius of savages to ad from the impulse
present paflion. They have neither forefiglt no
temper to form complicated arrangements tii]
refped to their futilre condud. The confultatioi

foresight or extent of intellectual abilities. Even
mong them, we lhall find public meaflures more

heir youth, than regulated by the experience and

man extend not beyond that state of society to
which he is habituated. What it presents as ob.
jets of contemplation or enjoyment, fills and fa.
tisfies his mind, and he can hardly conceive any
other mode of life to be pleasant, or even to.

extensive plains, and to subsist on the produ of
his herds, imprecates upon his enemy, as the
greatell of all curses, that he may be condemned
to reside in one place, and to be nourifled with

he North-Americans, though long encompalfed
three formidable European powers, still retain
rt of their original poffellions, and continue to
ift as independent nations. The people of Chili,
ough early invaded , flill maintain a gallant
ntclt with the Spaniards, and have set bounds

B o o K to their encroachments; whereas, in the warme

Iv. regions, men are more feeble in their frame, le

vigorous in the efforts of their mind, of a gentl
but dastardly spirit, more enslaved by pleasure, an
more funk in indolence. Accordingly, it is in th
torrid zone that the Europeans have most cor
pletely established their dominion over America
the most fertile and desirable provinces in it ar
fubjeted to their yoke; and if several tribes ther
still enjoy independence, it is either because the
have never been attacked by an enemy alread
satiated with conquest, and possessed of large
territories than he was able to occupy, or becau
they had been saved from oppression by thei
remote and inaccessible situation.

Conspicuous as this diftintion may appea

between the inhabitants of those different regions
it is not, however, universal. Moral and politica
causes, as I have formerly observed, assec tb
disposition and characer of individuals as wella
nations, still more powerfully than the influenc
of climate. There are, accordingly, some tribes
in various parts of the torrid zone, possessed ol
courage, high spirit, and the love of independence,
in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more
temperate climates. We are too little acquaintec
with the history of those people, to be ablet
trace the several circumstances in their progref
and situation, to which they are indebted for thi
remarkable pre.eminence. The fact, neverthelefs,i
certain. As early as the first voyage of Columbu!
he received information that several of the infand

he fame characer they have maintained invari-
ly in all subsequent contests with the people of
urope ; and, even in our own times, we have
en them make a gallant stand in defence of the
t territory which the rapacity of their invaders
ad left in their poffeflion "'. Some nations in
rafil were no less eminent for vigor of mind, and
ravery in war "09. The people of the isthmus of

ther instances might be produced. It is not by
tending to any tingle cause or principle, how
owerful and extensive soever its influence may
pear, that we can explain the acions, or account
r the character, of men. Even the law of climate,
ore universal, perhaps, in its operation than
y that affects the human species, cannot be
plied, in judging of theii conduct, without
any exceptions.

patible qualities united in one character. Such a

The man whom they pointed out to him was He appoints

bibed some tincture of learning. But he was soon
ifgfuted with al academic life, which did not

isi8. pointment he turned his views towards Americ

whither he was allured by the profpedt of t
advantages which he might derive from the patro
age of Ovando ', the governor of Hispaniola, wv
was his kinsman. When he landed at St. Doming
in one thousand five hundred and four, his receptio
was such as equalled his most sanguine hopes, a
he was employed by the governor in feve
honorable and lucrative fiations. These, howeve
did not satisfy his ambition; and in the year 0
thousand five hundred and eleven, he obtain
permiflion to accompany Diego Velasquez in

himself so much , that, notwithfanding some viole
contests with Velasquez, occasioned by triv
events, unworthy of remembrance, he was
length taken into favor, and received an am
concession of lands and of Indians, the recompen
usually bestowed upon adventurers in the N
World .

command, he had displayed such qualities in fever
scenes of difficulty and danger, as raised univeri

towards him , as one capable of performing gre

dexpended all their fortunes, they expressed
eir afonifiment and indignation at that illiberal

rifce, not only the honor of their general, but
their sanguine hopes of glory and wealth. With

so ardently desired. He swore that he would ne
desert soldiers who had given him such a sign

to conduct them to that rich country , which ha
been so long the object of their thoughts a

ports of military applause, accompanied with thre
and imprecations against all who should prefu

though every settlement had contributed its quo
of men and provisions; though the governor h
laid out considerable fums, and each adventur
had exlhufted his flock, or firained his credit, t
poverty of the preparations was such as muftaR
nifl the present age, and bore, indeed, no refe
hlance to an armnament destined for the conqu
of a great empire. The fleet consisted of elev
vessels; the largest of a hundred tons, which v
dignified with the name of Admiral ; three of
venty or eighty tons, and the reft fnall op
barks. On board of these were fix hundred a
seventeen men; of which five hundred and eig
belonged to the land service, and a hundred a

ine were seamen or artificers. The soldiers were B o o lr
vided into eleven companies, according to the v.
umber of the ships; to each of which Cortes ap-
ointed a captain, and committed to him the com-
and of the vessel while at sea, and of the men
hen on shore'. As the use of fire-arms among
e nations of Europe was hitherto confined to a
w battalions of regularly disciplined infantry,
nly thirteen soldiers were armed with muskets,
irty-two were crofs-bow-men, and the reft had
words and spears. Instead of the usual defensive
rmor, which must have been cumbersome in a
ot climate, the soldiers wore jackets quilted
ith cotton, which experience had taught the Spa-
ards to be a sufficient protection against the wea-
ons of the Americans. They had only sixteen
orfes, ten small field-pieces, and four falconets'.

cotton stuffs so tine, and of such delicate texture,

ther natural objects, formed with feathers of dif-
erent colors, disposed and mingled with such

what chiefly attracted their eyes, were two large
lates of a circular form, one of massive gold re-

of the moon' . These were accompanied with
racelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of
gold; ,and that nothing might be wanting which
could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what
the country afforded, with some boxes filled with
pearls, precious stones, and grains of gold un-

aftoniLhed at feeing any man dare to oppose tha
will, which they were accuflomed to confiders
supreme and irresistible, yet afraid of precipitating

midable enemies, prevailed with Cortes to promise,

Mexican original proposal, flould naturally have brought
empire at
thatperiod the negociation between him and Montezuma to a

speedy issue, as it seemed to leave the Mexican
monarch no choice, but either to receive him with
confidence as a friend, or to oppose him openly
as an enemy. The latter was what might have
been expeced from a haughty prince in poffeflion
of extensive power. The Mexican empire, at this

period, was at a pitch of grandeur to which no so- B o o Ic
ciety ever attained in so flort a period. Though v.
it had subsisted, according to their own traditions, Isl
only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion ex-
tended from the North to the South-Sea, over terri-
tories firetching, with some small interruption, above
fivc hundred leagues from east to weft, and more
than two hundred from north to south, comprehend-
il:, provinces not inferiorin fertility, population, and
opulence, to any in the torrid zone. The people were
warlike and enterprising; the authority of the mo-
narch unbounded , and his revenues considerable.
If, with the forces which might have been fud-
denly assembled in such an empire, Montezuma
had fallen upon the Spaniards while encamped
on a barren unhealthy coast, unsupported by any
ally, without a place of retreat, and destitute of
provisions, it seems to be impossible, even with all
the advantages of their superior discipline and arms,
that they could have Rlood the flock, and they
muff either have perilhed in such an unequal con-
test, or have abandoned the enterprise.

As the power of Montezuma enabled him to Character ol
take this spirited part, his own dispositions were themO,
such as seemed naturally to prompt him to it.
Of all the princes who had swayed the Mexican
sceptre, he was the most haughty, the most
violent, and the most impatient of control. His
fubjeds looked up to him with awe, and his
enemies with terror. The former he governed
with unexampled rigor, but they were impressed
with such an opinion of his capacity, as con-

tion which did not escape the notice of his meanet

MVontezuma's mind upon this occasion, as well as
the general dismay of his fubjedts, were not owing
wholly to the impression which the Spaniards had
made by the novelty of their appearance alnd the
terror of their arms. Its origin may be traced tip
to a more remote source. There was an opinion,
if we may believe the earliefc and most authentic
Spanish hiflorians, almost univerlifl among the
Americans , that some dreadful calamity was in-
pending over their heads , from a race of formin
dable invaders who flould come from regions to
wards the ri , ng fun, to overrun and desolate their
country. \'hcther this difquicting apprehenfio

sowed from the memory of some natural calamity n o o R
which had afflided that part of the globe, and im- v.
pressed the minds of the inhabitants with fuperfti- 1s9,
tious fears and forebodings, or whether it was an
imagination accidentally suggested by the aftonilh-
nmcnt which the firlt fight of a. new race of mlen
occasioned, it is impossible to determine. But as
the Mexicans were more prone to superstition than
any people in the New World, they were more
deeply affected with the appearance of the Spa-
niards, whom their credulity instantly represented
as the instruments destined to bring about this fa-
tal revolution which they dreaded. Under those --
circumstances, it ceases to be incredible that a
handful of adventurers should alarm the monarch
of a great empire , and all his fubjeds'l.

a transport of rage natural to a fierce prince un-
accustomed to meet with any opposition to his
will, he threatened to sacrifice those presumptuous
men to his gods. But his doubts and fears
quickly returned, and inftecad of issuing orders to
carry his threats into execution, he again called his

This conspiracy, though formed by persons o
low rank, was conduced with profound secrecy
but at the moment when every thing was read
for execution, they were betrayed by one of the
associates.

Hedeftroys Though the good fortune of Cortes interpose

this conspiracy filled his mind with most difquie
ing apprehensions, and prompted him to execute
scheme which he had long revolved. He perceive
that the spirit of disaffec'tion frill lurked among hi
troops; that though hitherto checked by th
uniform success of his schemes, or suppressed b
the hand of authority, various events might occu
which would encourage and call it forth. H
observed, that many of his men, weary of th
fatigue of service, longed to revisit their fettl
ments in Cuba; and that upon any appearance
extraordinary danger, or any reveYfe of fortune
it would be impossible to restrain them fro
returning thither. He was sensible that his forces
already too feeble, could bear no diminution, an
that a very small defecion of his followers woul
oblige him to abandon the enterprise. After rumnin
ating often, and with much solicitude, upon tho
particulars, he saw no hope of success, but
cutting off all poflibility of retreat, and reducih
his men to the necessity of adopting the fanl
resolution with which he himself was animated

ther to conquer or to perish. WTith this view, B o o Jt
e determined to destroy his fleet; but as he durst v.
ot venture to execute such a bold resolution by I't9
is single authority, he labored to bring his soldiers
o adopt his ideas with refped to the propriety of
his measure. His address in accomplishing this was
ot inferior to the arduous occasion in which it
as employed. He persuaded some, that the ships
ad suffered so much by having been long at sea,
to be altogether unfit for service; to others he
inted out what a seasonable reinforcement of
rength they would derive from the junction of
hundred men, now unprofitably employed as
ilors; and to all, he represented the necessity of
iing their eyes and wishes upon what was before
hem, without allowing the idea of a retreat once
o enter their thoughts. With universal consent
e flips were drawn ashore, and after tripping
hem of their fails, rigging, iron works, and
vhatever else might be of use, they were broke
pieces. Thus, from an effort of magnanimity,
owhich there is nothing parallel in history, five
!undred men voluntarily consented to be shut up
a hoflile country, filled with powerful and
nknown nations; and having precluded every
eans of escape, left themselves without any
source but their own valor and perfever-
lice ".

Nothing now retarded Cortes; the alacrity of

; o o R his troops and the disposition of his allies were

v. equally favorable. All the advantages, however,
519. derived from the latter, though procured by muc

assiduity and address, were well nigh loft in
moment by an indiscreet sally of religious zeal
which, on many occasions, precipitated Cort
into acions inconsistent with the prudence tha
distinguishes his characer. Though hitherto h
had neither time nor opportunity to explain t
the natives the errors of their own superstition
or to inflru&t them in the principles of the Chriftia
faith, he commanded his soldiers to overturn th
altars and to destroy the idols in the chief templ
of Zempoalla, and in their place to ered a crucifi
and an image of the Virgin Mary. The peopl
beheld this with astonishment and horror ; t
priefis excited them to arms; but such was th
authority of Cortes, and so great the afcendan
which the Spaniards had acquired, that the con
motion was appeared without bloodshed , and co
cord perfectly re.established. ".

in a country where tame animals were unknown, v.
was to carry burdens, and perform all servile labor. 1't'
They were a great relief to the Spanish soldiers,
who hitherto had been obliged, not only to carry
teir own baggage, but to drag along the artillery
ymain force. He offered likewise a considerable
body of his troops, but Cortes was satisfied with
our hundred; taking care, however, to chufe
persons of such note as might prove hostages for
he fidelity of their master. Nothing memorable
lappened in his progress, until he arrived on the
confines of Tlafcala. The inhabitants of that pro-
.ince, a warlike people, were implacable enemies
of the Mexicans, and had been united in an ancient
alliance with the caziques of Zempoalla. Though
less civilized than the fubjedls of Montezuma,
they were advanced in improvement far beyond
the rude nations of America, whose manners we
ave described. They had made considerable pro-
grefs in agriculture ; they dwelt in large towns;
hey were not strangers to some species of com-
merce; and in the imperfec accounts of their
inlitutions and laws, transmitted to us by the
early Spanish writers, we discern traces both of
diRributive justice and of criminal jurifdidion, in
heir interior police. But frill, as the degree of
heir civilization was incomplete, and as they
epended for subsistence not on agriculture alone,
but trufled for it, in a great measure, to hunting,
they retained many of the qualities natural to men
1 tills tate. Like them, they were fierce and

B o o ic revengeful; like them , too , they were high

v. spirited and independent. In consequence of th
'1"9- former, they were involved in perpetual hostilities

and had but a slender and occasional intercourf
with neighbouring fiates. The latter inspired the
with such detestation of servitude, that they no
only refused to stoop to a foreign yoke, and main
tained an obstinate and successful contest in defenc
of their liberty against the superior power of t
Mexican empire , but they guarded with equa
solicitude against domestic tyranny ; and difdainin
to acknowledge any master, they lived under th
mild and limited jurifdidtion of a council eleted b
their several tribes.

their inveterate enmity to the Mexicans, and th
example of their ancient allies the Zempoallans
might induce the Tlafcalans to grant him a friendl
reception. In order to dispose them to this, fou
Zempoallans of great eminence were sent amba
fadors, to request, in his name, and in that
their cazique, that they would permit the Sp
niards to pass through the territories of the r
public in their way to Mexico. But instead of t
favorable answer which was expected, the Tla

regard to their public character, made prepal
tions for sacrificing them to their gods. At th

he Tlafcalans into this resolution. A fierce people,
hut up within its own narrow precincts, and little
ccuflomed to any intercourse with foreigners,
apt to confider every stranger as an enemy, and
easily excited to arms. They concluded, from
tortes's proposal of visiting Montezuma in his
capital, that, notwithstanding all his professions,
e courted the friendlhip of a monarch whom they
oth hated and feared. The imprudent zeal of
Cortes in violating the temples in Zempoalla,
lied the Tlafcalans with horror ; and as they
ere no less attached to their superstition than the
other nations of New Spain, they were impatient

erit of offering up to them, as victims, those
mpious men who had dared to profane their altars;
he Spaniards, from the smallness of their number,
were objeds of contempt; they had not yet mea-
red their own firength with those new enemies,
nd had no idea of the superiority which they
erived from their arms and discipline.

Cortes, after waiting some days, in vain, for Aug. 3o.

te return of his ambaifadors, advanced into the Succefsofit,
lafcalan territories. As the resolutions of people
who delight in war are executed with no less
roinptitude than they are formed, he found
troops in the field ready to oppose him. They
attacked him with great intrepidity, and, in the
irRt encounter, wounded some of the Spaniards,,

u o o K and killed two horses; a loss, in their situation

v. of great moment, because it was irreparable. Fron

I this specimen of their courage, Cortes saw th

necessity of proceeding with caution. His armn
marched in close order; he chose the stations
where he halted , with attention, and fortifiec
every camp with extraordinary care. During four
teen days he was exposed to almost uninterruptec
a[aults , the Tlafcalans advancing with numerou
armies, and renewing the attack in various forms
with a degree of valor and perseverance to whic
the Spaniards had seen nothing parallel in theNe
World. The Spanish historians describe tho
successive battles with great pomp, and enter int
a minute detail of particulars, mingling many e

s this may seem, it is not inexplicable. The
lafcalans, though addicted to war , were, like
l unpolifhed nations, strangers to military order
nd discipline , and loft in a great measure the ad-
rantage which they might have derived from their
umbers , and the impetuosity of their attack, by
eir constant solicitude to carry off the dead and
runded. This point of honor , founded on a
ntiment of tenderness natural to the human mind,
nd frengthened by anxiety to preserve the bodies
their countrymen from being devoured by their
nemies, was universal among the people of New
pain. Attention to this pious office occupied
hem, even during the heat of combat 30, broke
heir union, and diminished the force of the im-
reffion which they might have made by a joint
fort.

Not only was their superiority in number of
ittle avail, but the imperfection of their military
reapons rendered their valor in a great measure
offensive. After three battles, and many lkir-
illies and assaults , not one Spaniard was killed

int or the bones of fifles, stakes hardened in the
re, and wooden swords, though deflrudive wea-.

IMany of the Spaniards were wounded, though a
slightly, which cannot be imputed to any wantn
courage or strength in their enemies, but to the d
feet of the arms with which they assailed them.

Notwithstanding the fury with which

Tlafcalans attacked the Spaniards, they seem
have conducted their hostilities with some degr
of barbarous generosity. They gave the Spaniar
warning of their hostile intentions, and as th
knew that their invaders wanted provisions, a
imagined, perhaps, like the other Americans, tb
they had left their own country because it did n
afford them subsistence, they sent to their cam
large supply of poultry and maize, desiring the
to eat plentifully , because they scorned to atta
an enemy enfeebled by hunger, and it would
an affront to their Gods to offer them famifled v
tims, as well as disagreeable to themselves to fe
on such emaciated prey ".

Mexico, or Tenuchtitlan, as it was ancien

alled by the natives, is situated in a large plain, n o o IQ
envilroied by mountains of such height, that, v.

acha other. The waters of the one are frefhi, those
f the other brackish. Oh the banks of the latter,

apital of Mlontezuma's empire was built. The

situation. From a concurrence of circurnflances, B o o KI
no less unexpeded than favorable to their pro- v.
grefs, they had been allowed to penetrate into the Is59'
heart of a powerful kingdom, and were now
lodged in its capital, without having once met
with open opposition from its monarch. The
Tlafcalans, however, had earnestly dissuaded them
from placing fTch confidence in M'lontezuma, as to
enter a city of such a peculiar situation as Mexico,
where that prince would have them at mercy, shut
up as it were in a snare, from which it was impof-
fible to escape. They assured him that the Nlexi-
can priests had, in the name of the Gods, coun-
felled their sovereign to admit the Spaniards into
the capital, that he might cut them off there
at one blow with perfect security ". They now
perceived, too plainly, that the apprehensions of
their allies were not detfitute of foundation; that,
by breaking the bridges placed at certain inter-
valson the causeways, or by defroying part of the
causeways themselves, their retreat would be ren-

Cholula, Cortes had received advice from Villa
Rica ", that Qualpopoca, one of the Mexican
generals on the frontiers, having assembled an
army in order to attack some of the peopl
whom the Spaniards had encouraged to throw o
the Mexican yoke, Efcalante had marched ou
-with part of the garrison to support his allies; tha
an engagement had ensued, in which, though t
Spaniards were victorious, Efcalante, with feve
of his men, had been mortally wounded, hi

rounded by the enemy, and taken alive; thatth
head of this unfortunate captive, after being car
tied in triumph to different cities, in order to con
vince the people that their invaders were no
immortal, had been font to Mexico ". Cortes
though alarlmed with this intelligence, as an indi
cation of IMlontezuima's holtile intentions, had con
tinned( his march. Bus as soon as he entere
Mexico, he became sensible, that, from an exce

of his troops, as well as from the disadvantage of R o o c
having nothing to guide him in an unknown v.
cou0ntry, but the defective intelligence which he rsig.
had received from people with whom his mode of
communication was very imperfec, he had puffed
forward into a situation, where it was difficult to
continue, and from which it was dangerous to re-
tire. Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain
consequence of attempting the latter. The fuc-
cess of his enterprise depended upon fiupporting
the high 6pinion which the people of New Spain
had formed with refped to the irresistible power
of his arms. Upon the first symptom of timi-
dity on his part, their veneration would cease, and
lontczuma, whom fear alone restrained at pre-
sent, would let loose upon him the whole force
of his empire. At the fame time, he knew that
the countenance of his own sovereign was to be
obtained only by a series of victories, and that no-
thing but the merit of extraordinary success could
screen his conduct from the cenfuire of irregular-
it.. From all these considerations, it was necbf-
fary to maintain his station, and to extricate him-
self out of the difficulties in which one bold ftep
had involved him, by venturing upon another
till bolder. The situation was trying, but his
mind was equal to it; and after revolving the
matter with deep attentioni, he fixed upon a plan
no less extraordinary than daring. He determined eefolves to
to seize Montezuma in his palace , and to carry fetzeMa
him as a prisoner to the Spanifl quarters. From
the fuperflitious veneration of the Mexicans for

which there appeared any profped of safety,
warmly approved of it, and brought over their

it was agreed instantly to make the attempt. A

great earnestness, and , as a proof of it, gave
orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his
ccomplices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied,
with seeming complaifancc, that a declaration so
efpeclable left no doubt remaining in his own
mind, but that something more was requisite to
atisfy his followers, who would never be con-
inced that Montezuma did not harbour hoflile
ntentions against them, unless, as an evidence of
is confidence and attachment, he removed from
isown palace, and took up his residence in the
Spanish quarters, where he should be served and
onored as became a great monarch. The first

uma of speech, and almost of motion. At length,
ndignation gave him utterance, and he haughtily
answered, " That persons of his rank were. not

fbjccls would not permit such an affront to be

'The unhappy victims were instantly led fort
The pile on which they were laid was compos
of the weapons collected in the royal magazi

double insult offered to the majesty of th
empire, an officer of diftindion committed to
flames by the authority of strangers, for havi
done what he owed in duty to his natural fov
reign; and the arms provided by the foresight
their ancestors for avenging public wrong

ance on the innfrumcnt employed in committit

impunity. Just before Qualpopoca was led 01
to fulfer, Cortes entered the apartment of Mont

nlima, followed by some of his officers, and

soldier carrying a pair of fetters; and approachil
the monarch with a stern countenance, told r1

tas the persons who were now to undergo the i o o n
niflment which they merited, had charged him v.
the cause of the outrage committed, it was 1'
cefary that he likewise nfould make atonement

that gtilt; then turning away abruptly,
thout waiting for a reply, commanded the
dier to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders
re instantly execLuted. The disconsolate monarch,
ined up with an idea that his person was sacred
dinviolable, ald confidering this profanation
it as the prelude of immediate death, broke out
oloud lamentations and complaints. His attend-
ts, speechless with horror, fell at his feet,
thing them with their tears; and bearing up the
ters in their hands, endeavoured with officious
dernefs to lighten their pressure. Nor did their
es and despondency abate, until Cortes returned
m the execution, and with a cheerful counte.

that Cortes, intoxicated with ficcefs, and prefu

to execute. But, in one view, these proceedin

have flowed from that artful policy which regula
every part of Cortes's behaviour towards
Nexicans. They had conceived the Spaniards
be an order of beings superior to men. It was
the utmost consequence to cherish this illufio

ith fond credulity, imagining that his messengers
ere returned from Spain, and that the completion
f all his wishes and hopes-was at hand, imparted
the glad tidings to his compianions, who received
hem with transports of mutual gratulation. Their
y was not of long continuance. A courier from
Sandoval, whom Cortes had appointed to succeed

ain information that the armament was fitted out

ringing the aid which they expeced, threatened

The motives which prompted Velasquez to this fittedoutby
violent measure are obvious. From the circum- velafrqgz.

tofupecd his intention of throwing off all depend-
nce upon him. His neglecting to transmit any
account of his operations to Cuba, fIrengthened
his suspicion, which was at last confirmed, be-

and were soliciting the king to confirm their pr

country, the valuabbl presents which Cortes ha

power, now raged in the bosom of Velasquez, A
these, with united force, excited him to make a
extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on th
author of his wrongs, and to wrest from him hi
usurped authority and conquests. Nor did he wa
the appearance of a good title to justify such a
attempt. The agent whom he sent to Spain wit
an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with
most favorable reception; and from the spec
mens which he produced, such high expectation
vwere formed concerning the opulence of Ne,
Spain, that Velasquez was authorized to profecut
the discovery of the country, and appointed g
xvernor of it during life, with more extensive powe
and privileges than had been granted to all

adventurerfromthetime of Columbus '. Elated by B o o r
this diflinguifhing mark of favor, and warranted v.
to confider Cortes not only as intruding upon his is2o.

of twelve pieces of cannon. As Velasquez's expe-

nother what he ought to have executed himself,
ad not rendered him more enterprising, he vested

of policy, but to take the field against an army in v.
courage and martial discipline equal to his own, in '15'
number far superior, ading under the fanetion of
royal authority, and commandedby an officer of
known bravery. He was informed that Narvaez,
more solicitous to gratify the resentment of Velaf-
quez, than attentive to the honor or interest of
his country, had begun his intercourse with the
natives, by representing him and his followers as
fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion against
their own sovereign, and of injustice in invading
the Mlexican empire; and had declared that his
chief objed in visiting the country was to punifl
the Spaniards who had committed these crimes,
and to rescue the Nlexicans from oppression. He
oon perceived that the fame unfavorable repre-
entations of his charadter and adions had been con-
weyed to Montezuma, and thatNarvaez had found
means to assure him, that as the conduct of those
who kept him under restraint was highly displeasing
to the king his master, he had it in charge not only
to rescue an injured monarch from confinement,
ut to rcinftate him in the possession of his ancient
o\vwr and independence. Animated with this
rofpcdl of being set free from fubjedion to firan-
els, the Mexicans in several provinces began open-
y to revolt from Cortes, and to regardNarvaez as
deliverer no less able than willing to save them.
Inntczuma himself kept up a secret intercourse
with the new commander, and seemed to court

ed to be unavoidable; for while the Spaniards
pressed him from without, the inhabitants, whose
turbulent spirit he could hardly restrain with all his
authority and attention, would eagerly lay hold on
such a favorable opportunity of avenging all their
wrongs. If he flould abandon the capital, set the
captive monarch at liberty, and march out to meet
the enemy; he must at once forego the fruits ol
all his toils and victories, and relinquish advanta,
ges which could rot be recovered without ex
traordinary efforts, and infinite danger. If, in
stead of employing force, he should have recourfi
to conciliating measures, and attempt an accom

of that officer, augmented by consciousness of hi!
present superiority, sorbad him to cherish any fan

against his countrymen, without attempting to
idjuft matters by an amicable negociation. In this
service he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to
whose chaÂ¥raider the function was well suited, and
who possessed, besides, such prudence and address,
as qualified him to' carry on the secret intrigues in
which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Narvaet
rejeded, with scorn, every scheme of accommo-
dation that Olmedo proposed, :and was with diffi-
culty restrained from laying violent hands on hinr
and his attendants. He met, however, with a
more favorable reception among the followers of
Narvaez, to' many of whom he delivered letters,
either from Cortes or his officers, their ancient
friends and companions. Cortes artfully accom-
panied these with presents of rings, chains of gold,
and other trinkets of value which inspired those
needy adventurers with high ideas of the wealth
that he had acquired, and with envy of their good
fortune who Were engaged in his service. Some,
from hopes of becoming (farers in those rich spoils,

The captive prince , unable to comprehend the
designs of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he
now heard with the declarations of Narvaez, and
afraid to difcovcr any symptom of fifpicion or dif-
trust of Cortes, promised to remain quietly in the
Spanifi quarters, and to cultivate the fame friend-

His strength, even after it was reinforced by Numberof

v. all these attempts proved fruitless. The intercourse
12zo. however, which this occasioned between the twc

parties, proved of no small advantage to Cortes
as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining fomi
of Narvaez's officers by liberal presents, of soften
ing'others by a semblance of moderation ; and o
dazzling all by the appearance of wealth among hi
troops, most of his soldiers having converted theil
fliare of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelet
and other ornaments, which they displayed with
military ostentation. Narvaez and a little junto o0
his creatures excepted, all the army leaned toward
an accommodation with their countrymen. Thi
discovery of their inclination irritated his violent
temper almost to madness. In a transport of rage
he set a prize upon the head of Cortes, apdo
his principal officers; and having learned that h(
was now advanced within a league of Zempoalli
with his small body of men, he confidered this ai
an insult which merited immediate chastisement
and marched out with all his troops to offer hir
battle.

Attacks But Cortes was a leader of greater abilities an(
Narvaez in experience than, on equal ground, to fight an enem)
the night,

so fr fuiperior in number, and to much bettel
appointed. Having taken his station on the oppO
fitc bank of the river de Canoas, where he kneÂ¢
that he could not be attacked , he beheld the ap
proach of the enemy without concern, and difrc
gardcd this vain bravade. It was then the begil1nil

cf

of the wet season '7, and the rain had poured n o o K
(lown, during a great part of the day, with the v.
violence pectliar to the torrid zone. The follow- ~1.
ers of Narvaez, unaccuflomed to the hardlhips of
military service, murmured so much at being thus
fruitlessly exposed, that, from their unfoldier-like
impatience, as well as his own contempt of his
adversary, their general permitted them to retire
toZempoalla. The very circumstance which induced
them to quit the field, encouraged Cortes to form
a scheme, by which he hoped at once to terminate
the war. He observed, that his hardy veterans,
though flanding under,the torrents, which conti-
nued to fall , without a tingle tent or any shelter
vhatfoever to cover them, were so far' from repi.
ning at hardships which were become familiar to
them, that they were still fresh and alert for ser-
vice. He foresaw that the enemy would naturally
give thernfelves up to repose after their fatigue,
and that, judging of the conduct of others by their
own effeminacy, they would deem themselves per.
felly secure at a season so unfit for action. He
resolved , therefore, to fall upon them in the dead
of night, when the surprise and terror of this un.
txpected attack might more than compensate the
nferiority of his numbers. His foldicrs, sensible
that no resource remained but in some desperate
ort of courage , approved of the measure with
Iuc warmth, that Cortes, in a military oration

e despised was real. The rapidity with which
iey advanced was such, that only one cannon
uld be fired, before Sandoval's party closed with

ice and example animated his men to the com-

v. they turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleamine
isÂ°-. through the obscurity of night, which, though

proceeding only from a variety of shining infecs
that abound in moist and sultry climates, theira
frighted imaginations represented as numerou
bands of mulketeers advancing with kindled matche
to the attack. After a short resistance, the soldier
compelled their officers to capitulate, and befor
morning all laid down their arms, and fubmitte
quietly to their conquerors.

f thisvie. as it was gained almost without bloodshed, on,

two soldiers being killed on the fide of Cortes, an

Verse fadion. Cortes treated the vanquilhed n
like enemies, but as countrymen and friends, an
offered either to fend them back direcly to Cub
or to take them into his service as partners in h
fortune, on equal terms with his own foldie
This latter propoftion, seconded by a feafonab
distribution of some presents from Cortes, and
beral promises of more, opened profpets so agre
able to the romantic expecations which had invit
them to engage in this service, that all, a fewp
tifans of Narvaez excepted, closed with it, a

on the facility with which this victory was ob.

ous transition the followers of Narvaez ranged
hemfelves under the standard of his rival, vill be
it to ascribe both events as much to the intrigues

B o O K must either be soon cut off by famine, or finl

1520. was excited by motives which rendered it fil

more alarming. On the departure of Cortesfo
Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves
that the long expected opportunity of reftorinI
their sovereign to liberty, and of vindicating thei
country from the odious dominion of strangers
was at length arrived ; that while the forces of thei
oppressors were divided, and the arms of one part:
turned against the other, they might triumph wit
greater facility over both. Consultations were hel
and schemes formed with this intention. The Sp
niards in Mexico, conscious of their own feebl
ness, fifpedted and dreaded those machination
Alvarado, though a gallant officer, possessed ne
ther that extent of capacity, nor dignity of ma
ners, by which Cortes had acquired such an afcen
ant over the minds of the Mexicans, as never
lowed them to form ajuft efimate of his weakn
or of their own strength. Alvarado knew no mo
of supporting his authority but force. Instead
employing address to disconcert the plans or
sooth the spirits of the IVlexicans, he waited

principal persons in the empire were dancing, a
cording to custom, in the court of the great te
pie; he seized all the avenues which led to it, an
allured partly by the rich ornaments which tlh
wore in honor of their gods, and partly by
facility of cutting off at once the authors of tl
conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon the

wn danger in assaulting an enemy who had been
long the objed of their terror, they committed
I those ads of violence of which Cortes received

To him the danger appeared so imminent, as Hemarches
admit neither of deliberation nor delay. He set back to the
utinlfantly with all his forces, and returned from
empoalla with no less rapidity than he had ad-
anced thither. At Tlafcala he was joined by two
oufand chosen warriors. On entering the Mexi-
an territories he found that difaffedion to the
paniards was not confined to the capital. The
rincipal inhabitants had deserted the towns through

ade for the subsistence of his troops; and though

ttacks, endeavoured, by barricading the streets,

ommunication of the Spaniards with the continent,

and his followers, was, whether they flould
arch out openly in the face of day, when they
uld discern every danger, and fee how to regu-
te their own motions, as well as how to resist the
aults of the enemy; or, whether they should en-
eavour to retire secretly in the night ? The latter
aspreferred, partly from hopes that their national
perftition would restrain the Mexicans from ven-

eager were the people on the deftrution of their,

to annoy them in person, impatient of the delay,

countrymen in the front with irresistible violence.
Freh warriors instantly filled the place of such as

unable to sustain the weight of the torrent that
poured in upon them, began to give way. In a mo.

a great cause of their calamity; for many of the n o o K
soldiers having so overloaded themselves with bars v.

tarded their flight, fell, ignominiously, the victims
of their own inconsiderate avarice. Amidst so
many disasters, it was some consolation to find that
Aguilar and Marina, whose function as interpreters
was of such essential importance, had made their
escape .

The first care of Cortes was to find some shelter Difficultre,
for his wearied troops; for as the Mexicans infest- "treats he
ed them on every fide, and the people of Tacuba
began to take arms, he could not continue in his
present station. He directed his march towards
the rising ground, and having fortunately disco-
vered a temple situated on an eminence, took pof-
felfion of it. There he found not only the shelter
for which he willed, but, what was no less wanted,
some provisions to refresh his men; and though
the enemy did not intermit their attacks through-
out the day, they were with less difficulty prevent-
ed from making any impreflion. During this time
Cortes was engaged in deep consultation with his
officers, concerning the route which they ought to
take in their retreat. They were now on the weft
fide of the lake. Tlafcala, the only place where
they could hope for a friendly reception, lay about
fixty-four miles to the east of Mexico7; so that

B o o K they were obliged to go round the north end of the

v. lake before they could fall into the road which
1510. led thither. A Tlafcalan soldier undertook to be

their guide, and conducted them through a coun.

cans hovering around them, sometimes harafing
them at a distance with their miflile weapons, and
fometinies attacking them closely in front, in rear,
in flank, with great boldness, as they now knew
that they were not invincible. Nor were the far
tigue and danger of those incessant conflicts the
worst evils to which they were exposed. As the
barren country through which they passed afforded
hardly any provisions, they were reduced to feed
on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maize;
and at the very time that famine was depressing
their spirits and wafting their firength, their fitua.
tion required the most vigorous and unremitting
exertions of courage and activity. Amidst those
complicated distresses, one circumstance supported
and animated the Spaniards. Their commander
fultained this fad reverse of fortune with unshaken
magnanimity. His presence of mind never forsook
him; his sagacity foresaw every event, and his vi.
gilance provided for it. He was foremost in every
danger, and endured every hardship with cheer.

rounded seemed to call forth new talents; and his
soldiers, though despairing themfelvos, continued

to follow him with increasing confidence in his B o o x
abilities. v.

cala. Early next morning they began to advance
towards it,. flying parties of the enemy still hang-
ing on their rear; and, amidst the insults with which
they accompanied their hostilities, Marina remark-
ed that they often exclaimed with exultation, "Go
on, robbers; go to the place where you shall
quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes."
The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not
comprehend, until they reached the summit of
an eminence before them. There a spacious valley
opened to their view, covered with a vast army,
extending as far as the eye could reach. The
Mexicans, while with one body of their troops
they harassed the Spaniards in their retreat, had
alfembled their principal force on the other fide of
the lake; and marching along the road which led
diretly to Tlafcala, ported it in the plain ofOtum-
ba, through which they knew Cortes must pass.
At the fight of this incredible multitude, which
they could survey at once from the rising ground,
the Spaniards were aftonilhed, and even the boldest
began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing
leisure for their fears to acquire strength by reflec-
tion, after warning them briefly that no alternative
now remained but to conquer or to die, led them
instantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited
their approach with unusual fortitude. Such,
however, was the superiority of the Spanidh

Y 3

B O O K discipline and arms, that the impression of this fmail

v body was irrerfitible; and whichever way its force
1520. was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the mor

numerous battalions. But while these gave way
in one quarter, new combatans advanced from
another, and the Spaniards, though successful in
every attack, were ready to fink under those re.
peated efforts, without feeing any end of their toil,
or any hope of vicory. At that time Cortes ob.
served the great flandard of the empire, which was
carried before the Mlexican general, advancing,
and fortunately recolleding to have heard, that on
the fate of it depended the event of every battle,
he assembled a few of his bravest officers, whose
horses were still capable of service, and placing
himself ac their head, pufled forward towards the
itandard with an impetuosity which bore down
every thing before it. A chosen body of nobles,
who guarded the standard, made some refifance,
but were soon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of
his lance, wounded the IViexican general, and
threw him to the ground. One of the Spanish of-
ficers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid
hold of the imperial standard. The moment that
their leader fell, and the standard, towards which
all directed their eyes, disappeared, an universal
panic struck the Mexicans, and, as if the bond
which held them together had been dissolved,
every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away
his weapons, and all fled with precipitation to the
mountains. The Spaniards, unable to purfuc them
far, returned to colledt the spoils of the field,

which were so valuable, as to be some compensation B o o z
for the wealth which they had loft in Mexico; for v.
in the enemy's army were most of their principal io.
warriors, dressed out in their richest ornaments, as
if they had been marching to assured vidory. Next

But, amidst their fatisfadion in having got Reception
beyond the precincts of a hostile country, they ofthes.pa
could not look forward without solicitude, as Tlarcala.
they were ffill uncertain what reception they might
meet with from allies, to whom they returned in
a condition very different from that in which they
had lately set out from their dominions. Happily
for them, the enmity of the Tlafcalans to the
Mexican name was so inveterate, their desire to
avenge the death of their countrymen so vehement,
and the ascendant which Cortes had acquired over
the chiefs of the republic so complete, that, far
from entertaining a thought of taking any advan-
tage of the distressed situation in which they beheld
the Spaniards, they received them with a tender-
ness and cordiality which quickly dissipated all
their suspicions.

was now absolutely necefTary; not only that the betrtiona of
Spaniards might give attention to the cure of their
vounds, which had been too long neglected, but
in order to recruit their ftreigth, exhausted by

o o K such a long succession of fatigue and hardflips,
v. During this, Cortes learned that he and his
110Â°q companions were not the only Spaniards who had

felt the effects of the Mexican enmity. A confi.
derable detachment, which was marching from
Zempoalla towards the capital, had been cut
off by the people of Tepeaca. A smaller party,
returning from Tlafcala to. Vera Cruz, with the
(hare of the. Mexican gold allotted to the garrison,
had been surprised and destroyed in the mountains,
At a juncture when the life of every Spaniard was
of importance, such losses were deeply felt. The
fchernes which Cortes was meditating rendered them
peculiarly afflictive to him. While his enemies, and
even many of his own followers, confidered the
disasters which had befallen him as fatal to the
progress of his arms., and imagined that nothing
now remained but speedily to abandon a country
which he had invaded with unequal force, his
mind, as eminent for perseverance as for enterprise,
was still bent on accomplithing his original purpose,
of fubjeding the Mexican empire to the crown of
Castile. Severe and unexpected as the check was
which he had received, it did not appear to him
a sufficient reason for relinquishing the conquests
which he had already made, or against resuming
his operations with better hopes of success. She
colony at Vera Cruz was not only safe, but had
remained unmolested. The people of Zempoalla
and the adjacent diflrids had discovered no fymp-
toms of defection. The Tlafcalans continued faithful
to their alliance. On their martial spirit, easily

outed to arms, and inflamed with implacable B o o K
atred of the Mexicans, Cortes depended for v.
werfuli aid. He had fill the command of a body '15-
Spaniards, equal in number to that with which
had opened his way into the centre of the
pire, and had taken possession of the capital,
that with the benefit of greater experience, as
ell as more perfeCt knowledge of the country,
did not despair of quickly recovering all that
had been deprived of by untoward events.
Full of this idea, he courted the Tlafcalan Themea.
iefs with such attention, and distributed among sureer h
m so liberally the rich spoils of Otumba, that
was secure of obtaining whatever he should
uire of the republic. He drew a small fiupply
ammunition, and two or three field-pieces, \
m his itores at Vera Cruz. He dispatched an
cer of confidence with four ships of Narvaez's
etto Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adven-
ers, and to purchase horses, gunpowder, and
er military stores. As he knew that it would
vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico,
ess he could secure the command of the lake,
gave orders to prepare, in the mountains of
afcala, materials for building twelve brigantines,
as they might be carried thither in pieces ready
be put together, and launched when he stood
need of their service 7.

merous army, the resolution even of those among
em who had adhered to Cortes when he was
ferted by their associates, began to fail. Their
rs led them to presumptuous and unfoldier-like
cullions concerning the propriety of their gene-
's measures, and the improbability of their
cess. From these they proceeded to censure and

deemed their commander to be totally negligent
Antonio Villefagna, a private soldier, but bold
intriguing, and firongly attached to Velasquez{
artfully fomented this growing spirit of difaffe
tion. His quarters became the rendezvous of th
malecontents, where, after many consultation
they could discover no method of checking Cort
in his career, but by affaflinating him and his mo
considerable officers, and conferring the comma
upon some person who would relinquish his wi
plans, and adopt measures more consistent vi
the general security. Despair inspired them wi
courage. The hour for perpetrating the crime,
persons whom they destined as victims, the offic
to succeed them in command, were all named; a
the conspirators signed an association, by whi
they bound themselves with most solemn oaths
mutual fidelity. But on the evening before
appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient follove
who had been seduced into the conspiracy, touch
with compunction at the imminent danger o
ruan whoi lie had long been accultomed to revc
or struck with horior at lis own treachery, w
privately to Iiis general, and revealed to him

f.lil:'s quarters, accompani(ed by some of his m
tiulty officers. l'he afloniflimcnt and confulion

onfeffion of his guilt. Cortes, while his attendants B o o Iu
izedl the traitor, snatched from his bosom a paper v.
oncaining the association, signed by the confpira- I5ir
ors. inpatient to know how far the defection
xtended, he retired to read it, and found there
ames which filled him with surprise and sorrow.
ut, aware how dangerous a firict scrutiny might
rove at such a junCture, he confined his judicial
quiries to Villefagna alone. As the proofs of his
uit were manifet , he was condemned after a
ort trial, and next morning he was seen hanging
fore the door of the house in which he had
odged. Cortes called his troops together, and
aving explained to them the atrocious purpose
f the conspirators, as well as the justice of the
unilhment inflided on Villefagna, he added, with
n appearance of fatisfadion, that he was entirely
norant with refped to all the circumstances of
is dark tranfadion, as the traitor, when arrested,
ad suddenly torn and fwallowc(l a paper, which
robably contained an account of it, and under
ie fcvcrefl tortures possessed such constancy as

rtful declaration restorcd tranquillity to many a
raft that was throbbing, while he spoke, with
onfcioufilefs of guilt and dread of detection; and
y this prudent moderation, Cortes had the advan-
igc of having discovered, and of being able to
hlervc such of his followers as were difaffecded;

and appointed fifteen thousand warriors to ac- u o o r
company and defend them. Sandoval made the v.
disposition for their progress with great propriety, I'
lacing the Tamenes in the centre , one body of
warriors in the front, another in the rear, with
considerable parties to cover the flanks. To each
of there he joined some Spaniards, not only to
ffft them in danger, but to accustom them to

Cortes determined to attack the city from B o O K

three different quarters; from Tepeaca on the v.
north-tfile of the lake, from Tacuba on the weft, S21.
and from Cuyocan towards the south. Those Tnipofitiong
towns were situated on the principal causeways
vwlich led to the capital, and intended for their
defcnce. He appointed Sandoval to command in
the first , Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and
Chriltoval de Olid in the third ; allotting to each
a numerous body of Indian auxiliaries, together
with an equal division of Spaniards, who, by the
junction of the troops from Hispaniola, amounted
now to eighty-fix horsemen, and eight hundred
and eighteen foot-foldiers; of whom one hundred
and eighteen were armed with muskets or cross-
bows. The train of artillery consisted of three bat-
tering cannon, and fifteen field- pieces 9. He re-
served for himself, as the station ofgreateft import-
ance and danger, the condudt of the brigantines,
each armed with one of his finall cannon, and man-
ned with twenty-five Spaniards.

As Alvarado and Olid proceeded towards the May o;

pofls assigned them, they broke down the aque-
dutds which the ingenuity of the Mexicans had
ereded for conveying water into the capital, and by
the diRtrefs to which this reduced the inhabitants,
gave a beginning to the calamities which they were
decfined to susser `'. Alvarado and Olid found the

assault him.

Mexicans The first effort of the Mexicans was to delroy
attack the the fleet of brigantines, the fatal effecs of whos

operations they foresaw and dreaded. Thoug
the brigantines , after all the labor and merit o
Cortes in forming them, were of inconfiderabl
bulk, rudely conftrucled, and manned chiefly wit
landmen, hardly possessed of Ikill enough to con
dud them, they muff have been objets of terro
to a people unacquainted with any navigation bu
that of their lake, and possessed of no vessel large
than a canoe. Neceflity, however, urged Guati
mozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to suppl
by numbers what he wanted in force , he affemblee
such a multitude of canoes as covered the face o
the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge
while the brigantines , retarded by a dead calm
Repuled. could scarcely advance to meet them. But as th

enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up
in a moment the fails were spread, the brigantines
with the utmost enfe , broke throtugh their feebl
opponents , overset many canoes, and dissipate
the whole armament with such fnluhter, as con
vinced the Mexicans, that the progrcfs of the ElI
yopeans in knowledge and .irts rendered their flup

riority greater on this new element, than they had n o o
hitherto found it by land 9. v.

From that time Cortes remained mafler of the 1-.r.

lake, and the brigantines not only preserved a planofcon.
communication between the Spaniards in their dif- duaingthe
ferent flations , though at considerable distance flene
from each other, but were employed to cover the
causeways on each fide, and keep off the canoes,
when they attempted to annoy the troops as they
advanced towards the city. Cortes formed the bri-
gantines in three divisions, appointing one to cover
each of the stations from which an attack was to be
carried on against the city , with orders to second the
operations of the officer who commanded there.
From all the three fiations he pushed on the attack
against the city with equal vigor; but in a manner
so very different from the conduct of sieges in regu-
larwar, that he himself seems afraid it would appear
no less improper than singular, to persons unac-
quainted with his situation ". Each morning his
troops assaulted the barricades which the enemy had
erected on the causeways , forced their way over
the trenches which they had dug, and through the
canals where the bridges were broken down, and
endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city,
in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage,
which might force the enemy to surrender, and
terminate the war at once ; but when the obstinate

i o o ;K valor of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the

v. day ineffetual , the Spaniards retired in the even

r. ing to their former quarters. Thus their toil an

danger were, in some measure, continually renew
ed; the Mexicans repairing in the night whatth
Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and re
covering the posts from which they had drive
them. But necessity prescribed this flow and un
toward mode of operation. The number of hi
troops was so small , that Cortes durst not, with
handful of men, attempt to make a lodgment in
city where he might be surrounded and annoye
by such a multitude of enemies. The remem
brance of what he had already suffered by the il
judged confidence with which he had ventured int
such a dangerous situation, was frill fresh in hi
mind. Tie Spaniards , exhausted with fatigue
were unable to guard the various posts which the
daily gained; and though their camp was fille
with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve thi
charge upon them, because they were so little a
cuflomed to discipline , that no confidence coul
be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cort{
was extremely solicitous to preserve the city a
much as possible from being destroyed, both b(
cause he deflined it to be the capital of his cor
quelts, and wished that it might remain as a me
nument of his glory. From all there confider;
tions, he adhered obstinately, for a month afte
the siege was opencd , to the system which he ha
adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence
displayed valor which was hardly inferior to til;

with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, o o I,
on water , by night and day, one furious con- v.
fliRC ficceeded to another. Several Spaniards were s21.
killed, more wounded, and all were ready to fink
under the toils of unintermitting service, which
were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of
the season, the periodical rains being now set in
with their usual violence ".

Aflonifhed and disconcerted with the length Endeavours

and difficulties of the siege, Cortes determined to totakethe
make one great effort to get possession of the city, ctyby torm
before he relinquilhed the plan which he had hi-
therto followed, and had recourse to any other
mode of attack. With this view, he sent inftruc-
tions to Alvarado and Sandoval to advance with
their divisions to a general assault, and took the
command in person of that posted on the causeway
of Cuyocan. Animated by his presence, and the July 3.
expectation of fotne decisive event, the Spaniards
pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity. They
broke through one barricade after another, forced
their way over the ditches and canals, and having
entered the city , gained ground incessantly, in
spite of the multitude and ferocity of their oppo-
neuts. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity
of his progress, did not forget that he might (ill
ind it necelfary to retreat; and in order to secure
t, appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of
chief note in the troops which lie had received from

warriors through different streets, some by land,
and others by water, towards the great breach in
the causeway, which had been left open. On a
signal which he gave, the prielts in the principal
temple struck the great drum consecrated to the
god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans hear its
doleful solemn found , calculated to inspire them
with contempt of death and enthusiastic ardor,
than they ruffled upon the enemy with frantic rage.
The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on no
less by religious fury than hope of success, began
to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good coun-
tenance ; but as the enemy pressed on , and their
own impatience to escape increased, the terror and
confusion became so general, that when they arf

Thich Cortes had now fubjeded to the crown of
Catile, the account of its rife and progress merits

Ferdinand Magalhaens, or Magellan, a Portu-
uefe gentleman of honorable birth, having served
everal years in the East Indies, with distinguished
valor, under the famous Albuquerque, demanded
the recompence which he thought due to his ser.
vices, with the boldness natural to a high-fpirited
soldier. But as his general would not grant his
suit, and he expected greater justice from his
sovereign, whom he knew to be a good judge and
a generous rewarder of merit, he quitted India
abruptly, and returned to Lisbon. In order to
induce Emanuel to liften more favorably to his
claim, he not only stated his paR services, but of-
sered to add to them by conducting his country-
men to the Molucca or Spice Islands, by holding a
westerly course; which he contended would be both
florter and less hazardous than that which the Por-

-5r. This was the original and a favorite project of Co.

lumbus, and Magellan founded his hopes of success
on the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by
many observations, the result of his own naval ex.
perience, as well as that of his countrymen in their
intercourse with the Eiaft. But though the Portu.
guefe Monarchs had the merit of having firt
awakened and encouraged the spirit of discovery in
that age, it was their destiny, in the course of a
few years, to rejed two grand schemes for this
purpose, the execution of which would have been
attended with a great accession of glory to their
reigns and of power to their kingdom. In confe.
quence of some ill-founded prejudice against Ma,
gellan, or of some dark intrigue which contempo.
rary historians have not explained, Emanuel would
neither belltow the recompence which he demanded,
nor approve of the scheme which he proposed; and
dismissed him with a disdainful coldness intolerable
to a man conscious of what he deserved, and ani-
mated with the sanguine hopes of success peculiar
to those who are capable of forming or of conductA
ing new and great undertakings. In a transport of
Ii17. rcfentment, Magellan formally renounced his alle

giance to an utngrateful rafter, and fled to the
court of Callile , where he cxpected that his talents
would be more juflly ef[imatcd. IHe endeavoured
to recommlend himself by offering to execute, tin
(der the patronage of Spain , that scheme, which he
had laid before the court of Portugal, the

ccomplilhment of which, he knew, would wound n o O
he monarch againfl whom he was exasperated in v.
he most tender part. In order to eftablifl the Ii'
ftnefs of his theory, he produced the fame ar-
uments which he had employed at Lisbon ; ac.
nowledging, at the fame time, that the undertaking
as both arduous and expeufive, as it could not
e attempted but with a squadron of considerable
rce, and vidualled for at least two years. For-
unately, he applied to a minister who was not
pt to be deterred, either by the boldness of a de-
gn, or the expense of carrying it into execution.
ardinal Ximenes, who at that time directed the
firs of Spain, discerning at once what an in.
reafe of wealth and glory would accrue to his
ountry by the success of Magellan's proposal,
ifened to it with a most favorable ear. Charles V.
n his arrival in his Spanish dominions, entered
nto the measure with no less ardor, and orders
ere issued for equipping a proper squadron at the
ublic charge, of which the command was given

v. one hundred and twenty tons. The crews of thq
str. whole amounted to two hundred and thirty-four

men, among whom were some of the most fkilfu
pilots in Spain, and several Portuguese sailors,
whose experience, as more extensive, Magella
placed still greater confidence. After touchin
at the Canaries, he stood diredly south toward
the equinoCtial line along the coast of America
but was so long retarded by tedious calms, an
spent so much time in searching every bay andin
let for that communication. with the Souther
Ocean which he wifled to discover, that he di
not reach the river De la Plata till the twelfth o
S~O. January. That spacious opening through whic

its valt body of water pours into.. the Atlantic
allured him to enter; but after failing: up it foi
some days, he concluded, from the shallowness of
the stream and the freshness of the water, that the
yifhed-for strait was not situated there, and con<
tinued his course towards the south. On the
thirty - first of March he arrived in the port of St.
Julian, about forty - eight degrees south of the
line, where he resolved to winter. In this un
comfortable station he lot one of his squadron, and
the Spaniards suffered so much from the exceflivt
rigor of the climate, that the crews of three ol
his ships, headed by their officers, rose in oper
mutiny, and insisted on relinquishing the vifionar)
projed of a desperate adventurer, and returninl
direCtly to Spain. This dangerous infurredior
Magellan suppressed, by an effort of courage n(

ess prompt than intrepid, and infliced exemplary B o o x
nilhment on the ringleaders. With the re- v.
ainder of his followers, overawed but not recon- 15zI.
led to his scheme, he continued his voyage to-
wards the south, and at length discovered, near
e fifty-third degree of latitude, the mouth of a
rait, int6 which he entered, notwithstanding the
urmurs and' remonstrances of the people under
is command. After failing twenty days in that
inding dangerous channel, to which'he gave his
wn name, and where one of his ships deserted
im, the great Southern Ocean opened to his
iew, and with tears of joy he returned thanks to
eaven for having thus far crowned his endea-
ours with success"'.
But he was frill at a greater distance than he
magined from the object of his wilhes. He failed
uring three months and twenty days in an uni-
orm direction towards the north-west, without
ifcovering land. In this voyage, the longest that
ad ever been made in the unbounded ocean, he
uffered incredible distress. His flock of provi-
ons was almost exhausted, the water became
utrid, the men were reduced to the shortest al-
wance with which it was possible to fuftlin life,
nd the scurvy, the most dreadful of all the mala-
is with which sea-faring people are afflicted, be-
an to spread among the crew. One circumftancc

B o o K alone afforded them some consolation; they en

v. joyed an uninterrupted course of fair weather, with
I=Â¶-. such favorable winds, that IMagellan beltowed on

that ocean the name of Pacific, which it still retains.
When reduced to such extremity that they mu
have funk under their fuffcrings they fell in with
a cluster of small but fertile islands, which afford
,Iarch 6. ed them refreshments in such abundance, that thei

health was soon re-eftablilfed. From these isles
which he called De Los Ladrones, he proceeded on
his voyage, and soon made a more important dif
covery of the islands now known by the name o
the Philippines. In one of these he got into a
unfortunate quarrel with the natives, who at
tacked him with a numerous body of troops wel
armed; and wNhile he fought at the head of his
April26. men with his hual valor, he fell by the hands o

those barbarians, together with several of his pri
cipal officers.

The expedition was prosecuted under othe

commanders. After visiting many of the fmalle
ifies scattered in the ealtern part of the Indian
ocean, they touched at the great island of Borneo,
xov. a. and at length landed in Tidore, one of the Mo-

luccas, to the aftoniflment of the Portuguese
who could not comprehend how the Spaniards, by
holding a wefierly course, had arrived at that fe.
questered feat of their most valuable commerce,
which they themfclves had discovered by failing
in an opposite diredtion. There, and in the ad.
jacent isles, the Spaniards found a people ac-
quainted with the benefits of cxtcnfive trade, auti

willing to open an intercourse with a new nation. B o o IK
They took in a cargo of the precious spices, which v.
are the distinguished production of those islands;
and with that, as well as with specimens of the
rich commodities yielded by the other countries
which they had visited , the Vic7or!, which, of the Jan. is=s.

the command of Juan Sebastian del Cano. He
followed the course of the Portuguese by the
Cape of Good Hope, and, after many disasters
and sufferings, he arrived at St. Lucar on the
feenth of September one thousand five hundred
and twenty-two, having failed round the globe,
in the space of three years and twenty - eight
days ".

Though an untimely fate deprived Magellan
f the fatisfadion of accomplifling this great un-
ertaking, his contemporaries, jufl to his memory
nd talents, ascribed to him not only the honor
f having formed the plan, but of having fur-
ounted almost every obltacle to the completion

A few weeks after the redudion of Mexico, Tapia
landed at Vera Cruz with the royal mandate to
strip its conqueror of his power, and to treat him
as a criminal. But Fonseca had chosen a very
improper infrurnent to wreal his vengeance on
Cortes. Tapia had neither the reputation nor the
talents that suited the high command to which he

which he was appointed. Cortes, while he publicly ex

peror's authority, secretly took measures to defea
the effect of his commission; and having involve

duCi, and the valor of his followers, had added
to the crown of Caflile. The juncture in which
his deputies reached the court was favorable.
The internal commotions in Spain, which had dif-
quieted the beginning of Charles's reign, were just
appeased "'. The ministers had leisure to turn their
attention towards foreign affairs. The account of

forgot the superiority of their enemies, and ran v.
to arms in defence of their liberties. In every US;2
contest , however , the European valor and
discipline prevailed. But fatally for the honor of
their country, the Spaniards sullied the glory
redounding from these repeated victories by their
mode of treating the vanquished people. After
taking Guatimozin, and becoming masters of his
capital, they supposed that the king of Castile
entered on poffeflion of all the rights of the
captive monarch, and affected to confider every
effort of the Mexicans to assert their own inde-
lendence, as the rebellion of vassals against their
overeign, or the mutiny of slaves against their
master. Under the fandion of those ill-founded
axims, they violated every right that flofild be
eld sacred between hostile nations. After each
infirredlion, they reduced the common people in
the provinces which they subdued, to the most
umilliating of all conditions, that of personal
civitudc. Their chiefs, supposed to be more
criminal, were puniffied with greater severity,
lid put to death in the most ignominiotus or the
not excruciating mode, that the insolence or

caziques of Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two
persons of greatest eminence in the empire, to be
hanged; and the Mexicans, with aftonifhmelne

site for opening those deep recesses where Nature
has concealed the veins of gold and silver, nor
sufficiently skilful to perform the ingenious opera-

and torrents from the mountains, and collecting
the grains of native metal deposited there. The

their treasures with such profusion on every quarter

the number of those employed in the mines, and

danger, and to struggle with difficulties; the fruits
of their viEtories and toils were reserved for times
of tranquillity, and reaped by successors of greater
industry, but of inferior merit. The early hifto.
rians of America abound with accounts of the
sufferings and of the poverty of its conquerors '
In New Spain, their condition was rendered mor
grievous by a peculiar arrangement. When Charles

the narrow ideas suited to the sphere in which
they had hitherto moved, they were aftonifled, on
arriving in Mlexico, at the high authority which 1f24.
Cortes exercised, and could not conceive that the
mode of administration, in a country recently sub-
dued and fettled , muf be different from what
took place in one where tranquillity and regular
government had been long eftabliflbed. In their
letters they represented Cortes as an ambitious
tyrant, who having usurped a jurifdicion superior
to law, aspired at independence, and by his ex-
orbitant wealth and extensive influence, might ac-
complifh those disloyal schemes which he appa-
rently meditated "'. These insinuations made stich
deep impression upon the Spanish ministers, most
of whom had been formed to business under the
jealous and rigid administration of Ferdinand, that,
unmindful of all Cortes's pafl services, and re-
gardlefs of what he was then suffering in conduct-
ing that extraordinary expedition , in which he

trns to after his arrival in New Spain, prevented the exe.
pgaiq. cution of this commiflion. But as the object of

his appointment was known, the mind of Cortes
was deeply wounded with this unexpeced return
for services, which far exceeded whatever any sub.
jed of Spain had rendered to his sovereign. He
endeavoured, however, to maintain his station,
and to recover the confidence of the court. But
every person in office, who had arrived from Spain
since the conquest, was a spy upon his condudt,
and with malicious ingenuity gave an unfavorable
representation of all his actions. The apprehen.

new commission of inquiry was issued, with more
extepfive powers, and various precautions were
taken in order to prevent or to punish him, if he
should be so presumptuous as to attempt what was
inconsistent with the fidelity of a subjed "'. Cortes
beheld the approaching crisis of his fortune with

conscious of high desert, and receiving unworthy
treatment. But though some of his desperate fol1

Cortes appeared in his native country with the Hisrecep.
splendor that suited the conqueror of a mighty tionthere
kingdom. He brought with him a great part of
his wealth, many jewels and ornaments of great
value, several curious produCtions of the country I",
and was attended by some Mexicans of the first
rank, as well as by the most considerable of his
own officers. His arrival in Spain removed at once
every fufpiciory and fear that had been entertained
with refped to his intentions. The emperor, hav-
ing now nothing to apprehend from the designs of
Cortes, received him like a person whom confci,
oufnefs of his own innocence had brought into the
presence of his master, and who was entitled, by
the eminence of his services, to the highest marks
of diftindion and refped. The order of St. Jago,
the title of Vlarquis del Valle de Guaxaca, the
grant of a vast territory in New Spain, were fuc.

dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico with
diminished authority. The military department,
with powers to attempt new discoveries, was left
in his hands; but the supreme direcion of civil
affairs was placed in a board, called T/he Audience
of New Spain. At a subsequent period, when,
upon the increase of the colony, the exertion o

along the eaft-coaft of North-America, some firait
would be found that communicated with the weft-
ern ocean; or that, by examining the isthmus of

the North and South-Seas "'. But having been dif-
appointed in his expectations with refped to both,
he now confined his views to such voyages of dif-
covery as he could make from the ports of New
Spain in the South-Sea. There he fitted out fuc-
ceflively several small squadrons, which either pe.
rilled in the attempt, or returned without making
any discovery of moment. Cortes, weary ofintruft- 1S36.

the command of a New armament in person, and,
after enduring incredible hardships, and encoun-

AS a particular description makes a stronger impression
tan general assertions, I shall give one of Rio de la Plata
by an eye-witness, P. Cattaneo, a Modenefe Jesuit, who
Inded at Buenos Ayres in I749, and thus represents what
be felt when such new objects were first presented to his
view. "While I resided in Europe, and read in books of
uiory or geography that the mouth of the river De la
]a was a hundred and fifty miles in breadth, I cenfidered

it as an exaggeration, because in this hemisphere we hav
no example of such vtaf rivers. \When I approached it
mouth, I had the most vehement delire to ascertain th
truth with my own eyes; and I have found the matter t
be exactly as it was represented. This I deduce particularl
from one circumlrtance: When we took o',. departure fror
IMonte-Video, a fort situated more than a hundred mile
from the mouth of the river , and where its breadth i
conliderably diminiihed, we failed a complete day befor
We discovered the land on the opposite bank of the river
and when we were in the middle of the channel, we couli
not discern land on either fide, and saw nothing but thi
sky and water, as if we had been in some great ocean
Indeed, we ihould have taken it to be sea, if the fred
water of the river, which was turbid like the Po, had n
satisfied us that it was a river. lIoreover, at Buen
Ayres,- another hundred miles up the river, and where
is frill much narrower, it is not only impossible to dice
the opposite coast, *hich is indeed very low and flat; b

NOTE IV. p. Io.

A COSTA is the first philosopher, as far as I know, who
endeavoured to account for the different degrees of heat
is the old and new continents, by the agency of the winds
shich blow in each. Hist. Moral. &c. lib. ii. and iii.
I. de Buffon adopts this theory, and has not only improved
itby new observations, but has employed his amazing
powers of descriptive eloquence in embellishing and placing
iin the most striking light. Some remarks may be added,
which tend to illustrate more fully a dodtrine of much
iportance in every inquiry concerning the temperature of
nrious climates.

\hen a cold wind blows over land, it must in its pas-
ge rob the surface of some of its heat. By means of
is, the coldness of the wind is abated. But if it continue
blov in the fame direction , it will come, by degrees,
paps over a surface already cooled, and will susser no
nger any abatement of its own keenneis. Thus as it
ainces over a large trad of land, it brings on all tho
verity of intense frofs.
Let the fame wind blow over an extensive and deep sea;
e superficial water must be immediately cooled to a certain
tgree, and the wind proportionally warmed. But the
prficial and colder water becoming specifically heavier than
|swarutler water below it, descends; what is warmer supplies
place, which , as it comes to be cooled in its turn,
inues to warm the air which passes over it, or to
nilh its cold. This change of the superficial water,
l fucceflive ascent of that which is warmer, and the
nfiquent fuccellive abatement oF coldnels in the air, is
ed by the agitation caulefd in the lea by the mechanical
on of' the wind, and also by the motion of the tides.
iswill go on , and the rigor of the wind will continue

arrelted by frost. \Vhenever the surface freezes, the wind
is no longer warmed by the' water fomn 'below, and it goes
on with undiminiflaed cold.

From those principles may be explained the severity o

Winter-frofts in extensive continents; their mildness in mall
islands; and the superior rigor of winter in those parts o
North - America with which we are belt acquainted. In the
north-wefl parts of Europe, the severity of winter is mitigate
by the weft winds, which usually blow in the months o
November, December, and part of January.

On the other hand, when a warm wind blows oe

land, it heats the surface, which murf therefore cease t
abate the fervor of the wind. :But the fane wind blow
ing over water, agitates it, brings up the colder water fron
below , and thus is continually loling somewhat of its owl
heat.

But the great power of the sea to mitigate the heat o

the wind or air palling over it, proceeds from the followin
circumstance, that on account of the transparency of th
sea, its surface cannot be heated to a great degree by th
fun's rays; whereas the ground, fubjeded to their influenc
very soon acquires great heat. When, therefore, the win
blows over a torrid continent, it is Coon raised to a he
almost intolerable; but during its passage over an extensi
ocean, it is gradually cooled; so that on its arrival at th
farthest shore, it is again fit for respiration.

Those principles will account for the sultry heats of lar

continents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate of illan
in the fame latitude; and for the superior warmth in fumm
which large continents, lituated in the temperate or col
zones of the earth, enjoy, when comnared with that
islands. The heat of a climate depends not only upon t
immediate effcdt of the fun's rays, but on their continu
operation, on the efffRt which they have formerly produc
and which remains for some time in the ground. This
the reason why the clay is warmelt about two in t
afternoon, the fuimcer warnielt about the middle of Jul
and the winter coldcfl about the middle of January.

The forests which cover America, and hin"der the fun-
beams from heating the ground, are a great cause of the
temperate climate in the equatorial parts. The'ground,
not being heated, cannot heat the air; and the leaves,
which receive the rays intercepted from the ground, have
not a maits of matter sufficient to abfbrb heit enough for
this purpose. Belides, it is a known fadt, that the vege-
tative power of a plant occaflons a perlpiration from the
leaves in proportion to the heat to which they are exposed;
and, from the nature of evaporation, thi. perspiration
produces a cold in the leaf proportional to the perspiration.
Thus the effect of the leaf in heating the air in contact
with it, is prodigiously diminished. For those observations,
which throw much additional light on this curious fubjedt,
I am indebted to ny ingenious friend, Mlr. Robifon.
profefTor of natural philosophy in the university of Edin-
burgh.

degree of cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mir. Bogle,
in his elnbalfy to the court of the Delai Lama, passed the
;rinter of the year 1774 at Chammanning, in latitude tI
39' N. He often found the thermometer in his room
tw'enty-nine degrees under the freezing point by Fahren-
hcir's scale; and in the middle of April the standing waters
were all frozen, and heavy showers of snow frequently fell.
The extraordinary elevation of the country seems to be the caufa
of this excelfive cold. In travelling from Indoitan to Thibet,
the ascent to the fummnit of the Boutan Mountains is very great,
tbrJ the descent on the other fide is not in equal proportion.
The kingdom of Thibet is an elevated region, extremely
:ire and desolate. Account of Thibet, by Mr. Stewart,

The nmof obvious and probable cause of the superior
decree of cold , towards the southern extremity of America,
iccn: to be the form of the continent there. Its breadth

degree of heat in its progress over it. These circumiftances
concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this diftrid
of America, more similar to that of an insular, than to
that of a continental climate, and hinder it from acquiring
the fame degree of summer - heat with places in Europe and
Asia, in a corrcCponLding northern latitude. The north-wind
is the only one that reaches this part of America, after
blowing over a great continent. But from an attentive
furvev of its position, this will be found to have a
te:dency , r.ther to dimiirfh than augment the degree of
heat. The fouthein extremity of America is properly tle
termination of the immense ridge of the Andes, which
itretches nearly in a d-re6t line from north to south,
through the whole extent of the continent. The molt sultry
regions in South-America, Guiana, Brasil, Paraguay, and
Tucuman, lie many degrees to the' ceft of the tlagellanic
regions., The level country of Peru , which enjoys the
tro:ical heats, is situated considerably to the weft of them.
The north-wind then, though it blows over land, does
not bring to the bsuthern extremity of America, an increase
of heat collected in its panthge over torrid regions; hut
before it arrives there , it mult have swept along the summits
of the Andes, and comes impregnated with the cold of
tant frozen region.

Though it be now demonstrated that there is no fouthb

ern continent in that region of the globe which it waa
supposed to occupy, it appears to be certain from Captani
Cook's difcovcries, that there is a large tract of land neat
the fouth-pole, which is the source of nlolt of the ici
spread over the valt southern ocean. Vol. ii. p. 20o. 239

tinent may reach the southern extremity of America
and affct its climate, is an inquiry not unworthy Qs att

T HE animals of America seem not to have been always
of .a size inferior to those in other quarters of the globe.
From antlers of the moofe-deer which have been found
in America, it appears to have been an animal of great
size. Near the banks of the Ohio, a considerable number
of bones of an immense magnitude have been fount. The
place where this discovery has been made lies about one
hundred and ninety miles below the junction of the river
Scioto with the Ohio. It is about four miles distant from
the banks of the latter, on the fide of the marsh called
the Salt Lick. The bones lie in vast quantities about five
or fix feet under ground , and the itratum is visible in the
bank on the edge of the Lick. Journal of Colonel George
Croglan, MS. penes me. This spot seems to be accurately
laid down by Evans in his map. These bones must have
belonged to animals of enormous bulk; but naturalists
being acquainted with no living creature of such size, were
at first inclined to think that they were mineral substances.
Upon receiving a greater number of specimens, and after
infpedting them more narrowly, they are now allowed to
be the hones of an animal. As the elephant is the largest
known quadruped, and the tusks which were found nearly
resembled, both in form and quality, the tusks of an
elephant, it was concluded that the carcases deposited on
the Ohio were of that species. But Dr. Hunter, one of
the persons of our age best qualified to decide with refpet
to this point, having accurately examined several parcels
of tusks, and grinders, and jaw-bones, font from the Ohio
to London, gives it as his opinion, that they did not belong
to an elephant, but to some huge carnivorous animal of an
unknown species. Phil. Transact. vol. lviii. p. 34. Bones

Tlhe eIlphant teems to be confined in his range to the torrid

, those bordering on the frozen sea, he could not live.
The exifence of such large animals in America might open
Iaide field for conjecture. The more we contemplate the
cc of nature, and confider the variety of herproductions,
tremore we must be satisfied that astonishing changes have
ben made in the terraqueous globe by convulsions and
evolutions, of which no account its preserved in hiflory.

IlIS degeneracy of the domestic European animals in

merica ought to be imputed partly to each of these causes.
ithe Spanish settlements, which are situated either within
e torrid zone, or in countries bordering upon it, the
icreae of heat, and diversity of food , prevent sheep and
orned cattle from attaining the fame size as in Europe.
hey seldom become so fat, and their flesh is not so juicy,
of such delicate flavor. In North-America, where
the climate is more favorable , and similar to that of Europe,
e quality of the grafels which spring up naturally in their
aRure-grounds is not good. Alitchell, p. X s1. Agriculture

W ERE this the place for entering into a long and intri.
cate geographical disquisition, many curious obfervatiuns might
arie from comparing the accounts of the two Ruffian voyages
and the charts of their refpecrive navigations. One remark is
applicable to both. We cannot rely with absolute certainty
on the position which they assign to several of the places
which they visited. The weather was so extremely foggy,
that they seldom saw the fun or stars, and the position of the
islands and supposed continents was commonly determined by
reckoning,not by observation. Behringand Tfchirikow proceed.
ed much farther towards the east than Krenitzin. Theland
discovered by Behring, which he imagined to be part of the
American continent, is in the 2.6th degree of longitude
from the filft meridian in the isle of Ferro , and in O8
2S" of latitude. Tfchirikow came upon the fame coast in
long. 241Â°, lat. 56Â°; luller. i. 249, 249. The former
mult have advanced 60 degrees from the port of Petro-
pawlowfki, from which he took his departure, and the
laiter 6g degrees. But from the chart of [renitzin's voy-
age, it appears that he did not fail farther towards the east
than the 2o8th degree, and only iz degrees from Petro-
pakwlox ski. In 1741, liehring and Tfchirikow , both in
going and returning, held a course which was molily to
the south of that chain of ifl.inds, which they discovercd
and observing the mountainous and rugged afpcct of the
head-lands vwhich they dcfcricd towards the north, thle
fulj)pofld them to be pronmontories belonging to some parl
of the American continent, which as they fancied
tl'ctchcd as fir south as the latitude ,6. In this mannc
they are laid down in the chart publifhled by Muller, an
likcwife in a manuscript chart drawn by a mate

Behring's ihip, communicated to me by Mr. Professor Robifon.
But in 1769, Krenitzin, after wintering in the illand
Alaxa, Rfood so far towards the north in his return, that
his course lay through the middle of what Behring and
Tl'hirikow had supposed to be a continent, which he
found to be an open sea, and that they had miflaken rocky
ifes for the head-lands of a continent. It is probable, that
the countries discovered in 74 r , towards the east, do n6t
belong to the American continent, but are only a conti-
nuation of the chain of islands. The number of volcanoes in
this region of the globe is remarkable. There are several
hi Kamchatka, and not one of the islands, great or finall,
s far as the Ruffian navigation extends, is without theni.
lany are adtually burning, and the mountains in all bear
iarks of having been once in a slate of eruption. Were I
Ufpofed to admit such conjedtures as have found place
inother inquiries concerning the peopling of America, I
might suppose that this part of the earth,' having manifeltly
fffered violent convulsions from earthquakes and volcanoes,
ar ilthmus, which may have formerly united Asia to
Pnerica, has been broken, and formed into a clufler of
ilands by the shock.
It is singular, that at the very time the Ruilian naviga-
trs were attempting to make discoveries in the north-west
tiAmerica the Spaniards were prosecuting the fame design
ni another qUarter. In 1769, two finall veftels failed
onl Loretto in California to explore the coalls of the
Ountry to the north of that peninsula. They advanced
to rther than the port of Monte-Rey in latitude 36. But,
c'veral fucceflive expeditions fitted out From the port of
t.Bas in New Galicia, the Spaniards have advanced as
as the latitude 8. Gaceta de Madrid, Mlarch 19, and
Iy 14, 1776. But as the journals of tholf voyages
we not yet been publihed, I cannot compare their
rogrcls with that of' the Ruffians, or Jhow how near

navigators of the two nations have approached
eail other. It is to be hoped, that the enlightenel

minister, who has now the diredion of Anierictf
affairs in Spain, will not withhold this information from
the public.

O UR knowledge of the vicinity of the two continents ol
Aia and Itmerica, which was very imperfeLd when I
published the hiltory of America in the year r777, is now
complete. Mlr. Coxe's Account of the Rulfian Difcovcriei
between Asia and America, printed in the year f1 go
contains many curious and important fads with refped tc
the various attempts of the Rufflians to open a communica.
tion with the New World. The history of the great Voy
age of discovery , bei:un by Captain Cook in I776, and
completed by Captains Clerk and Gore, published in th\
yeir 780 , communicates all the information that th!
curiosity of manklind could desire with regard to thi
subject.

At my requefR, my friend lMr Playfair, Professor o

Ma;thematicks in the University of bdinbhugh, has comparei
the narrative and charts of those illultrious navigators
with the more imperfect relations and maps of tih
IRuilians. The refuli of tlis comparison I coinmunicat|
in his own words, with much greater confidence in hi
fcicntific accuracy than I could have ventured to place il
any observations which I myself might have made upon th
1fuject.

" The discoverics of Captain Cook in his last voyag

h;ave confirmed the conclulions which Dr. Robertson ha
drawn, and have connected together the facts from whic!
t.. y were deduced. They have now rendered it certai

that though the account of his voyage is much abridged
in the English translation, Captain Cook recognised the
place as he failed along the weltern coast of America in
the year 1778. The ille of St. Hermogenes, near the
mouth of Cook's river, Schumagin's Isles on the coast of
Alafhka, and Foggy Ife, retain in Captain Cook's chart the
names which they had received from the Ruffian navigator;
Cook's Voy. vol. ii. p. 347.

" Tschirikow came upon the fame coast about 2Â° 30o
farther south than Behring, near the Mount Edgecumbd
of Captain Cook.

" With regard to Irenitzirii we learn from Coxe's
Account of the Ruffian Discoveries, that he failed front
the mouth of the Kamtfchatka river with two ships in the
year 1768. With his own ship he reached the island
Oonolahka, in which there had been a Ruflian fettlenient
lince the year 1762, where he wintered, probably in the
fame harbour or bay where Captain Cook afterwards an-
chored. The other ship wintered at Alafhka, which was
supposed to be an island, though it be in face a part of the
American continent. Krenitzin , accordingly , returned
without knowing that either of his ships had been on the
coast of America; and this is the more surprising, because
Captain Cook has informed us that Alafhka is understood to
be a great continent both by the Rulfians and the natives
at Oonolafhka.

According to Krenitzin, the ship which had wintered at
Al;fhlka had hardly failed 32z to the eastward of the harbour of
St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtchatka; but, according to the
more accurate charts of Captain Cook, it had failed no lets than
17' 17' to the eastward of that harbour. There is nearly
the fame miltake of ' in the longitude which Krenitzinr
alfigns to Oonoliafhka. It is remarkable enough, that in
the chart of those leas, put into the hands of Captain
Cook by the Rulfians on that illand , there was an error
of the fame kind, and very nearly of the fame. extent.

" But what is of molt consequence to be remarked on
this lubjcct is, that the difroverics of Captain Cook have

fully verified Dr. Robertson's conjecture, " that it is prbbable
that future navigators in those seas, by steering farther, to
the north than Behring and Tfchirikow or Krenitzin had
done, may find that the continent of America approaches
fill nearer to that of Alia. " Vol. ii. p. 44. It has
accordingly been found that these two continents, which
in the parallel of SÂ°, or that of the southern extremity
of Alaflka, are about four hundred leagues asunder, ap.
proach continually to one another as they tretch together
toward the north, until, within less than a degree from
the polar circle, they are terminated by two capes, only
thirteen leagues distant. The east cape of Asia is in lati.
tude 66Â° 61, and in longitude 9goÂ° 22' east from Green.
which; the western extremity of America or Prince o
Wales Cape, is in latitude 65Â° 46', and in longitude 191
4S/. Nearly in the middle of the narrow strait (Behring'
Strait) which separates these capes, are the two islands o
St. Diomede, from which both continents may be teen
Captain King informs us, that as he was failing throug
this itrait July S , 1779, the fog having cleared away, h
enjoyed the pleasure of feeing from the ship the continent
of Asia and America at the fame moment, together witl
the islands of St. Diomede lying between them. Cook'
Voy. vol. iii. p. 244.

" Beyond this point the strait opens towards the Ardi

Sea, and the coasts of Asia and America diverge so fa
from one another, that in the parallel of 69' they are mor
than one hundred leagues asunder. Ib. p. 277. To th
south of the strait there are a number of islands
Clerke's, King's, Anderson's, &c. which, as well a
thole of St. Dioniede, may have facilitated the migration
of the natives from the one continent to the other. Captai
Cook, however, on the authority of the Ruffians at Oono
lalfha, and for other good reasons, has diminished th
number of islands which had been inserted in form
charts of the northern Archipelago. He has also place
Alafhka, or the promontory which stretches from th
continent of America S. W, towards lanltchatka, at th

diltance

difance of five degrees of longitude farther From the
coalt of Asia than it was reckoned by the Ruffian navi-
gators.

' The geography of the Old and the New World is

therefore equally indebted to the discoveries made in this
memorable voyage; and as many errors have been corrected,
nnd many deficiencies supplied by means ofthefe discoveries,
so the accuracy of tome former observations has been
clsablilhed. The basis of the map of the Ruffian Empire,
as far as regarded Kamtfchatka, and the country of the
Tfchutzki, was the position of four places, Yakutlh,
Ochotz, Bolcherefk, and Petropawlofki which had been
determined by the astronomer Kraffilnicow in the year i744.
Nov. Coment. Petrop. vol. iii. p. 46 , &c. But the
accuracy of his observations was contested by M. Engel,
and M. Robert de Vaugondy; Coxe, Append. i. No. 2I
p. 267, 27 ;' and the former oftheCe geographers ventured
to take away no less' than 28 degrees from the longitude,
which, on the faith of Kraffilnicow's observations, was
assigned to the eastern boundary of the Ruffian empire.
With how little reason this was done, will appear from
to:fidering that our British navigators, having determined
the position of Petropawlofki by a great number of very
accurate observations. found the longitude of that port . g 8
43' F. from Greenwich, and its latitude s53 i'; agreeing,
the firfl to less than seven minutes, and the second to
leSs than half a minute, with the calculations of the
Ruflian astronomer: a coindence which, in the situation of
so remote a place, does not leave an uncertainty of more
than four English miles, and which, for the credit of
science, deserves to be particularly remarked. The chief
error in the Runifan maps has been in not extending' the
boundaries of that empire sufficiently towards the east For
as there was nothing to connedt the land of the Tfchutzkl
and the north-east point of Asia with those places whereo
fthe position had been carefully ascertained, except tho'

derable errors could not fail to be introduced, and that point
waslaid down as not more than 21' 21 ear of the meridian
of Petropawlofki. Coxe, App. i. No. 2. By the observations
of Captain King, the difference of longitude between Petro.
pawlofki and the East Cape is ; t 91; that is 8' 7' greater
than it was supposed to be by the Ruffian geographers. -
It is probable that this interesting portion of geographical
knowlcdge Sill, in the course of a few years, receive
sartier improvement. Soon after the publication of
Car.tain Cook's last voyage, the great and enlightened
Sovereign of Rullia, attentive to every thing. that may
contribute to extend the bounds of science, or to render
it more accurate, formed the plan of a new voyage of
discovery, in order to explore those parts of the ocean
lying between Asia and America, which Captain Cook
did not visit, to examine more accurately the islands
which firetch from one continent almost to the other, to
survey the north-east coast of the Ruffian empire, from
the mouth of the Kovyma, or Kolyma, to the North-
Cape, and to fettle, by astronomical observations, the
position of each place worth notice. The .condut of this
important enterprise is committed to Captain Billings, an
English officer in the Ruffian service, of whose abilities
for that station it will be deemed the best evidence, that
he accompanied Captain Cook in his last voyage. To
render the expedition more extensively useful, an eminent
naturalist is appointed to -attend Captain Billings. Six,
years will be requisite for accomplishing the purposes of
the voyage. Coxe, Supplement to Ruffian Discoveries, p.

in proportion to their diltance from the eÂ¢jor, but
according to the degree of elevation of the terfry which

face is round, farther removed, perhaps, than that of any
people from an oval shape. Their forehead is fniall, the

their nose flat, their eyes black, or of a.chefiut color,

M . GODIN LE JEUNE, who resided fifteen years
among the Indians of Peru and Ouito, and twenty years in
the French colony of Cayenne, in which there is a constant
intercourse with the Galibis and other tribes on the Orinoco,
observes, that the vigor of conflitution among the Americans
is exacly in proportion to their habits of labor. The Indians,
in warm climates, such as those on the coasts of the
South- Sea, on the river of Amazons, and the river Orinoco,
are not to, be compared for strength with those in cold
countries id yet, fays he, boats daily set out from Para,
a Portugue e'fettlement on the river of Amazons, to ascend
that river against the rapidity of the itream, and with the
fame crew they proceed to San Pablo, -which is eight
hundred leagues distant. No crew of white people, or
even of negroes, would he found equal to a talk of such
persevering fatigue, as the Portuguese have experienced,
and yet the Indians, being accustomed to this labor from
their infancy, perform it. MS. penes me.

D ON ANTONIO ULLOA, who visited a great part of
Peru and Chili, the kingdom of New Granada, and several
of the provinces bordering on the Mexican gulf, while
employed in the fame service with the French mathematicians
during the space of ten years, and who afterwards had an
opportunity of viewing the North-Americans, alferts, "that
if we have fecn one American, we may be said to have
seen them all, their color and make are so nearly the
Came." Notic. Americanas, p. o08. A more early observer,
Pedro de Cieca de Leon, one of the conquerors of Peru,
who had likewise traversed many provinces of America,
affirms, that the people, men ard women, although there
is such a multitude of tribes or nations as to be almoA

Innumerable, and such diverity of climates, appear never-
thelels like the children of one father and mother. Chronica
del Peru, parte i. c. 19. There is, no doubt, a certain
combination of features, and peculiarity of afpedt, which
forms what may be called a European or Asiatic countenance.
There must likewise be one that may be denominated
American, common to the whole race. This may be
supposed to strike the traveller at first fight, while not
only the various shades, which distinguish people of different
regions , but the peculiar features which discriminate
individuals, escape his observation. But when persons who
had resided so long among the Americans concur in bearing
~eftimony to the similarity of their appearance in every
climate, we may conclude that it is more remarkable than
that of any other race. See likewise Garcia, Origen de los

THE teflimonies of different travellers, concerning the
Patagonians, have been collected and stated with a confi-
derable degree of accuracy by the author of Recherches
Philofophiques, &c. tom. i. 28 1, &c. iii. i8 r, &c.
Since the publication of his work, several navigators have
viited the Magellanic regions, and, like their predeceflbrs,

Dd;

Commodore Byron and his crew, who failed through the
Straits in 1764, the common size of the Patagonians wal
estimated to 1he ciglt feet, and many of them much taller.
Phil. Transact. v, 1. lvii. p. 78. By Captains Wallis and
C;. ceret, x ho actually measured them in 1766, they were
found to be from fix feet to fix feet five and seven inches
in height. P'.l Tr:;f. vol. lx. p. 22. These, however,
see.n to l;ave been the very people whose size had been
rated so high in the ye.lr i"64; for several of them had
beads and red baize of the fame kind with what had been
put aboard Captain Wallis's ship, and he naturally concluded
that they had got these from Mr. Byron. Hawkefw. i. In
1767 they were again measured by M. Bougainville, whose
account agrees nearly with that of Captain Wallis. Voy.
129. To these I flall add a testimony of great weight:
In the year i76z, Don Bernardo lbagnez de Echavarri
accompanied the Miarquis de Valdelirios to Buenos Ayres,,
and resided there several years. He is a very intelligent
author, and his reputation for veracity unimpeached among
his countrymen. In speaking of the country towards the
southern extremity of America, c" By what Indians, " fays
lie c is it possessed ? Not certainly by the fabulous
Patagonians, who are supposed to occupy this difiridt. I
have from many eye-witnefles, who have lived among
those Indians, and traded much with them, a true and
accurate description of their persons. They are of the fume
stature with Spaniards. 1 never saw one who rose in height
two varns and two or three inches, " i. e. about So or
8 1. 3 2 inches Englif , if Echavarri malkes his computation
according to the varr us ladricld. This agrees nearly with
the mealurclme it of Captain 'Wallis, Reino Jefuitico, 238.
Â·Alr. Falkner, who resided as a millionary forty years in
the {buthern parts of America, fays, that " the Patagoni;lns,
or luelches, are a large-bodied people; but 1 never heard
of that gigantic race which others have mentioned, thouIgh
I have sIen perlfns of all the dift'rent tribes of southern
Indians." Introd. p. 26. A1. Dobri,.hoHl'cr, a .efuit, whlc
rclided eightccn ycars in Paraguay , anld who had seen grcl'

numbers of the various tribes which inhabit the countries
situated upon the Straits of Magellan, confirms, in every
point, the testimony of his brother miflionary Falkner.
Dubrizhoffer enters into fime detail with refped to the
opinions of several authors concerning the stature of the
Patagonians. Having mentioned the reports of tome early
travellers with regard to the extraordinary size of some
bones found on that coast, which were supposed to be
human; and having endeavoured to show that these bones
belonged to some large marine or land animal, he concludes,
"d e hifce offibus crede quicquid libuerit, dummodo, me

ANTON SANCHEZ RIBEIRO, a learned and ingenious
physician, published a dissertation in the year 1765, in
which he endeavours to prove, that this disease was not
introduced from America, but took its rife in Europe,
and was brought on by an epidemical and malignant
disorder. Did I chufe to enter into a disquisition on this
fubjedt, which I should not have mentioned, if it had not
been intimately connected with this part of my inquiries,
it would not be difficult to point out some mistakes with
rcfpect to the fads upon which he founds, as well as some
errors in the consequences which he draws from them. The
rapid communication of this disease fiom Spain over
Europe, seems however to resemble the progrcfs of an
epidemic, rather than that of a disease tranfinittcd by
inffction. The first mention of it is in the year r49l ,
anl before the year 1497 it had lmade its aipearancc in
Inult countries of Europe, with such ;l;rniing fympronls
as rendered it neceffury for the civil maglHitr.te to interpose,
in order to check its career. - Since the publication of
thlis work, a second edition of Dr. Sanclez's Diftrtation
has been communicated to me. It contains several '

additional fiats in confirmation of his opinion, which i
supported m ith such plausible arguments, as render it

As the view which I have given of rude nations ih
extremely different from that exhibited by very refpeclabie
authors, it may be proper to produce tome of the many
authorities on which I found my description. The manner,
of tl.e savage tribes in Atmerica have never been viewed by
persons nore capable of observing them with discernment,
than the philofi!phers employed bh France and Spain, in the
year ii , to determine de figure of the earth. M.
Bouguer, D. Antonio de Ulloa, and D. Jorge Juan, resided
log among the natives of the leIf civilized provinces in
Peru. M. de la Condamine had nut only the fame advantages
with them for observation , but, in his voyage down the
V1aragnlon, he had an opportunity of infi)caing the state
of the various nations fcreted on its banks, in its val
course across the continent of South-.\meica. There is a
wonderful resemblance in their rcprefcntation of the
chara;'er of the Americans. " They ;.rc all extremel)
ilnolert, " fa;is M. Bougucr, " they ,re ilupid, they pa's
wlhole days fitting in the fane place, without moving, o
fpclainig a tingle word. It is noc easy to defcribc tho
degree of their indifference for wealth, and all its advantages
One does not well know what. motive to propose to them
when one would perfuiadc them to perfrnm any service

It is vain to offer them money; they answer, that they
are not hungry." Voyage au Perou, p. o12. " If one
confiders theil as men, the narrowness of their understand-
ing seems to be incompatible with the excellence of the
foul. Their imbecility is so visible, that one can hardly
frnm an idea of them different from what one has of the
brutes. Nothing. ditlurbs the tranquillity of their fouls,
equally infenlible to disasters and to prosperity. Though half-
r.ied, they are as contented as a monarch in his mofc splendid
array. Riches do not attract them in the fmalleff degree,
and the authority or dignities to which they may aspire
are so little the objects of their ambition, that an Indian
will receive with the fame indifference the office of a judge
(Alcalde) or that of a hangman, if deprived of the former
and appointed to the latter. Nothing can move or change
them. Interest has no power over them, and they often
refuse to, perform a fmnall service, though certain of a
great recompence. Fear makes no impreflion upon them ,
and relpect as little. Their disposition is so singular, that
there is no method of influencing them, no means of rous-
ing them from that indifference, which is proof against all
the endeavours of the wifefi 'persons; no expedient which
can induce them to abandon that gross ignorance, or lay
aide that careless negligence, which disconcert the prudence
and disappoint the care of such as are attentive to their
welfAre " Voyage de Ulloa, tom, i. 3; , ;S6. Of those
singular qualities he produces many extraordinary instances,
P. ;6-3 47. " Infenlibility, " fays M. de la Condamine,
"is the basis of the American charadter. I leave others
to determine , whether this should be dignified with the
lnme of apathy, or disgraced with that of ffupidity. It
aries, without doubt, from the finall number of their
idecs, which do not extend beyond their wants. Gluttons
t'en to voracity, when they have wherewithal to satisfy
heir appetite. Temperate, when necessity obliges them,

such a degree, that they can endure want without
neling to desire any thing. Pulillanimous and cowardly
0 xcef s, unleis when they are rendered desperate* by

drunkenness. Averse to labor, indifferent to every motive
of glory , honor, or gratitude; occupied entirely by the
object that is present; and always determined by it alone,
without any solicitude about futurity; incapable of foresight
or of reflecion; abandoning themselves, when under no
restraint, to a puerile joy, which they express by frilking
about, and immoderate fits of laughter; without object or
delign, they pass their life without thinking, and grow
old without advancing beyond childhood, of which they
retain all the defects. If this description were applicable
only to the Indians in rome provinces of Peru, who are
slaves in every rcfpect but the name, one might believe,
that this degree of degeneracy was occasioned by the servile
dependence to which they are reduced; the example of
the modern Greeks being proof how far servitude may
degrade the human species. But the Indians in the missions
of the Jesuits, and the savages who still enjoy unimpaired
liberty, being as limited in their faculties, not to fay as
stupid as the other , one cannot observe, without humiliation,
that man, when abandoned to simple nature, and deprived
of the advantages resulting firom education and society , differs
but little from the brute creation. " Voyage de la Riv. des

manz. 2, 5 . MI. de Chanvalon, an intelligent and
philosophic21 observer, who visited Martinico in r17t , and
relidcd there fix years, gives the following description 0o
the Caraibs " It is not the red color of their complexion
it is not the singularity of their features, which conflitute!
the chief difference between them and us. It is their excefliv
slimplicity; it is the limited degree of their faculties. Thei
reason is not more enlightened or more provident than thi
infliiut of brutes. The reason of Lhe most gross peasants, tha
of the negroes brought up in the parts of Africa most remoti
from intercourse with Europetans , is such that we difcove
:i|pcara;nc's of intelligence , which, though imperfect,
ca.pable of incrcfi. iBut of this the underltanding c
C .rlibs seems to be hardly flifceptible. If found philofolh
and religion didl not aiford us their light, if we ,ter
tu decide according to the first imprellion which the vie'

of that people makes upon the mind, we should be disposed
to believe that they do not belong to the fame species with
us. Their Itupid eyes are the true mirror of their fouls;
it appears to be without funtions. Their indolence is extreme;
thev have never the least solicitude about the moment which
is to fuceed that which is present. " Voyage a la Martinique,
p. 44, 45;. r. MM. de la Borde, Tertre. and Rochefort,
confirm this description. " The charateriftics of the
Californians, " fays P. Venegas, " as well as of all other
Indians, are stupidity and insensibility ; want of knowledge and
reReceion; inconstancy, impetuolity, and blindness of appetite;
anexceflive sloth, and abhorrence of all labor and fatigue;
an excelfive love of pleasure and amusement of every kind,
how0ever trifling or brutal; pusillanimity, and, .in fine, a
nolt wretched want of every thing which conflitutes the
real man, and renders him rational, inventive, tracdable,
and useful to himself and society. It is not easy for
Europeans, who never were out of their own country, to
conceive an adequate idea of those people: for, even in
the least frequented corners of the globe, there is not a
nation so ltupid, of such contracded ideas, and so weak
both in body and mind, as the unhappy Californians.
Their understanding comprehends little more than what
they fee; abftrat ideas, and much less a chain of reasoning,
being far beyond their power ; so that they scarce ever
improve their first ideas, and these are in general false, or
at leall inadequate. It is in vain to represent to them
any future advantages which will result to them from doing
or abltaining from this or that particular immediately
present ; the relation of means and ends being beyond
tlie llretch of their faculties. Nor have they the least
r(tion of'purfuing such intentions as wiill procure themselves
f0imc future good, or guard them againIt future evils.
Their will is proportional to their facultics, and all their
Pallions move in a very narrow fplherc. Ambition they
h,15e none, and arc more desirous of being accounted strong
t11a vailiant. The objects of ambition with us, honor,
Ih'ne, reputation, titles , polts , and diflinicions of

superiority, are unknown among them; so that this powerfu
spring of action, the cause of so much seeming good and
real evil in the world, has no power here. This disposition
of mind, as it gives them up to an amazing languor and
laflitudc, their lives fleeting away in a perpetual inacivit)
-and detestation of labor, so it likewise induces them to he
attracted by the first objed which their own fancy, or the
persuasion of another, places before them; and at the fame
time renders them as prone to alter their resolutions with
the fame facility. They look with indifference upon any
'kindness done them nor is even the bare remembrance ol
it to be expeded from them. In a word, the unhappy
mortals may be compared to childred, in whom the
developement of reason is not completed. They may
indeed be called a nation who never arrive at manhood."

that negroes from all the different provinces of Africa ar

D OBRIZHOFFER, the last traveller, I know, whI

dcftroy a considerable number of their offspring, as to thloa

great light on the observations I have made, p. 72, 7t.

were these ideas imprinted in the mind of the Americans ,
that the Peruvians, a civilized people, when compared
wxith the barbarous tribes, whose manners I am describing,
retained them; and even their intercourse with the Spaniards
has not been able to root them out. When twins are
born in any family, it is fiill confidered as an ominous
event, and the parents have recourse to rigorous acts of
mortification, in order to avert the calamities with which
they are threatened. When a child is born with any'
deformity, they will not, if they can pobfibly avoid it,
bring it to be baptized, and it is with difficulty they canr
be brought to rear it. Arriaga Extirpac. de la Idolat. del

R EMARI(ABLE .instances occur of the calamities which
rude nations susser by famine. Alvar. Nugnez Cabeca de

adventurers, relided almost nine years among the savages
of Florida. They were unacquainted with every species
of agriculture Their subsistence was poor and precarious.
"' They live chiefly (fays he) upon roots of different
plants, which they procure with great difficulty, wandering
from place to place in search of them. Sometimes they
hill game, sometimes they catch fiil , but in such small
quantities, that their hunger is so extreme as compels
them to eat spiders, the eggs of ants, worms, lizards,
serpents, a kind of undtuous earth, and I am pcrfuaded,
that if in this country there were any ,loncs, they would
swallow these. They preserve the bones of filles and
serpents, which they grind into powder, and eat. The
only season when they do not fiifitr much from famine,
is when a certain fruit, which he calls Tunzar, is ripe.

N EW HOLLAND, a country which fornierly was onl
known, has lately been visited by intelligent observers. Il
lies in a region of the globe where it must enjoy a very
favorable climate, as it stretches from the loth to the
38th degree of northern latitude. It is of great extent,
and from its square form must be much more than
equal to all Furope. The people who inhabit the various
parts of it appear to be of one race. 'hey are evidcntly
ruder than nmolt of the Americans, and have made still less
progress in improvement and the arts of life. ' here is not
the least appearance of cultivation in any part of this vail
region. The inhabit:lnts are extremely few, so that the
country appears a.lnio!t dlefblate. Their tribes are (till more
inconliderablc than those of Anmerica. 'They depend foi
fubbficcncc, almost entirely, on fishing. They do not fettle

are more simple and rude than those of the Americans.

specimen of his condition and powers in that uncultivated

future navigators, the comparison of the manners of
its inhabitants with those of the Americans will

fee the boundaries, through which there flowed many
brooks and rivers, but without any path to conduct us.
Sometimes we were obliged to open a passage across thick
fores, through bushes, and underwood filled with briars
d thorns. Sometimes we had to pars through deep
arfles, in which we funk up to the middle. After being

I STRONGLY fufpeA that a community of goods, anc
an undivided store, are known only among the rudel
tribes of hunters; and that as soon as any species of agri
culture or regular induitry is known, the idea of at
exclusive right of property to the fruits of them is introduced
I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which I hay
received concerning the state of property among the Indian
in very different regions of America. " The idea of th
natives of Brasil concerning property is, that if any perfo
cultivate a field, he alone ought to enjoy the produce c
it, and no other has a title to pretend to it. If a
individual or family go a hunting or fishing, what
caught belongs to the individual or to the family, and the
communicate no part of it to any but to their cazique
or to such of their kindred as happen to be indisposed.
any person in the village come to their hut, he may
down freely, and eat without asking liberty. But this
the consequence of their general principle of hofpitalitO
for I never observed any partition of the increase of the
fields, or the produce of the chafe, which I could consid
as the result of any idea concerning a community of goo
On the contrary, they are so much attached to what th
deem to be their property, that it would be extreme
dangerous to encroach upon it. As far as I have fee
or can learn, there is not one tribe of Indians in Sou
America, among whom that community of goods wh
has been so highly extolled is known. The circumstance
the government of the Jesuits, mopt irksome to the Indi
of Paraguay, was the community of goods which th
fathers introduced. This was repugnant to the orig!
ideas of the Indians. They were acquainted with the ril
of private exclusive property, and they submitted 5
impatience to regulations which destroyed them." "
cheval. de Pinto, MS. pcnesr me. "( Adual poffelfion (
a millionary who relided several years among the Indian

the Five Nations) gives a right to the foil, but whenever
a pofleffor fees fit to quit it, another has as good right
to take it as he who left it. This law, or custom, refpets
not only the particular spot on which he erects his house,
but also his planting-ground. If a man has prepared a
particular spot of ground , on which he designs in future to
build or plant, no man has a right to incommode him,
much less to the fruit of his labors, until it appears that
he voluntarily gives up his views. But I never heard of
any formal conveyance from one Indian to another in their
natural fiate. The limits of every canton are circumscribed;
that is, they are allowed to hunt as far as such a river
on this hand, and such a mountain on the other. This
area is occupied and improved by individuals and their
families. Individuals, not the community, have the use
and profit of their own labors, or success in hunting. '!

their authority appears chiefly in war, and the expeditions

not by hereditary right, but by their valor in war , or by the
power and number of their families and relations. Sometimes
they owe their pre-eminence to their eloquence in displaying
their own exploits. " Ribas, Hiftor. de los Triumph. &c, p. ii.
The Itate of the Chiquitos in South - America is nearly the
fame. " They have no regular form of government, or
civil life, but in matters of public concern they liften to
the advice of their old men, and usually follow it. Th
dignity of Cazique is not hereditary, but conferred accordin
to merit, as the reward of valor in war. The union amon
them is imperfect. Their society resembles a republi
without any head , in which every man is mailer of himsel
and, upon the least disgust, separates from those wit
whom he seemed to be connected " Relacion Hiftorica de la

THE Americans, like other fierce nations, originally
cut off the heads of the enemies whom they flew in war,
and carried them away as trophies. But, as they found
there cumbersome in their retreat, which they always make
very rapidly, and often through a vast extent of country,
they became satisfied with tearing off their fdalps.
This custom, though most prevalent in North-America, was
not unknown among the Southern tribes. Lozano, p. 79.

M ANY singular circumn ances concerning the treatment

taken prisoner by the Toupinambos, and remained in

habit of the Americans is such, that they are less fenfibie
of pain than the reft of mankind. He produces several

SOME tribes in the province of Cinaloa, on the gulf of
California, seem to be among the rudest people of Ame-
rica united in the social state. They neither cultivate nor
sow; they have no houses in which they reside. Those
in the inland country subsist by hunting; those on the sea-
coast chiefly by fishing. Both depend upon the spontaneous
productions of the earth, fruits, plants, and roots of
various kinds. In the rainy season, as they have no
habitations to afford them shelter, they gather bundles of
reeds, or strong grass, and binding them together at one
end, they open them at the other, and fitting them to
their heads, 'they are covered as with a large cap, which
like a pent-house throws off the rain, and will keep them
dry for several hours. During the warm season, they form
a flhed with the branches of trees, which protects them
from the sultry rays of the fun. When exposed to cold
they make large fires, round which they sleep in the open

" Their greatest ingenuity ( fays Mr. Ellis) is shown in the

wood, each making part of the fame arch, very nicely and
exaaly joined together. They are commonly of fir or
larch; and as this wants strength and elasticity, they sup-
ply both by bracing the back of the bow, with a kind of
thread, or line, made of the sinews of their deer, and
the bow-firing of the fame materials. To make them draw
more fliffly, they dip them into water, which causes both
the back of the bow and the firing to contract, and con.
fequently gives it the greater force; and as they practise
from their youth, they sloot with very great dexterity. "

get so far the start of others in circumstances nearly

story, or to some peculiarity in their situation with which
we are unacquainted. The people in the island of Otaheite,
lately discovered in the South- Sea, far excel most of the
Americans in the knowledge and pratice of the arts of

intellectual as well as moral qualities in the most favorable
light, afterts, that they are engaged in continual negocia-
tions with their neighbours, and condudt there with the
most refined address. At the fame time he adds, " that it
behoves their envoys or plenipotentiaries to exert their
abilities and eloquence, for if the terms which they offer
are not accepted of, they had need to stand on their
guard. It frequently happens, that a blow with a hatchet
is the only return given to their propositions. The envoy

A ND. BERNALDES, the contemporary and friend of
Columbus, has preserved some circumstances concerning
the bravery of the Caribbees, which are not mentioned by
Don Ferdinand Columbus, or the other historians of that
period, whose works have been published. A Caribbean
canoe with four men, two women, and a boy, fell in
unexpecedly with the fleet of Columbus in his fecund
voyage, as it was steering through their islands. At first,
they were firuck almost stupid with astonishment at such a
strange fpedacle, and hardly moved from the spot for
above an hour. A Spanish bark, with twenty-five men,
advanced towards them, and the fleet gradually surrounded
them, so as to cut off their communication with the shore.
"( When they saw that it was impof(ible to escape (fays
the historian), they seized their arms with undaunted re.
solution, and began the attack I use the expreflion,
.with undaunted r efo/ltion, for they were few, and
beheld a vast number ready to affiult them. They wounded
several of the Spaniards, although they had targets, as
well as other defensive armor; and even after their canoe
was overset, it was with no little difficulty and danger thai
part of them were taken, as they continued to defeni
themselves, and to use their bows with great dexterit!

A PROBABLE conjecture may be formed with refped
to the cause of the diftindtion in character between the
Caribbees and the inhabitants of the larger islands. The
former appear manifestly to be a separate race. Their lan.
guage is totally different from that of their neighbours in
the large islands. They themselves have a tradition, that
their anceflors came originally from some part of the
continent, and having conquered and exterminated the
ancient inhabitants, took pofleffion of their lands, and of
their women. Rochefort, 384. Tertre, 60. Hence
they call themselves Banaree, which signifies a man come
from beyond sea. Labat. vi. 11. Accordingly, the
Caribbees itill use two diflind languages, one peculiar to
the men, and the other to the women. Tertre, ;36. The
language of the men has nothing common with that spoken
in the large islands. The dialect of the women confider-
ably resembles it. Labat. z9. This strongly confirms
the tradition which I have mentioned. The Caribbees
themnelves imagine, that they were a colony from the
Galibis, a powerful nation of Guiana, in South-.merica.
Tertre, 36i. Rochefort, 348. Butastheir fierce manners
approach nearer to those of the people in the northern
continent, than to those of the natives of South-America;
and as their language has likewise some affinity to that
spoken in Florida, their origin should be deduced rather
from the former than from the latter. Labat. i 2, &c.

O UR knowledge of the events which happened in the
conquest of New Spain, is derived from sources of
information more original and authentic than that of any
transaCtion in the history of America. The letters of
Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are a historical
monument, not only first in order of time, but of the
greatest authenticity and value. As Cortes early affumned
a command independent of Velasquez, it became necessary
to convey such an account of his operations to Madrid,
as might procure him the approbation of his fuvereign.

The first of his dispatches has never been made public.

It was sent from Vera-Cruz, July i6th, ir19. As I
imagined that it might not reach the Emperor, until he
arrived in Germany, for which he set out early in the year
, 2o, in order to receive the Imperial crown; I made
diligent search for a copy of this dispatch, both in Spain
and in Germany, but without success. This, however, is
of less consequence, as it could not contain any thing very
material, being written so soon after Cortes arrived in New
Spain. But, in searching for the letter from Cortes, a
copy of one from the colony of Vera-Cruz to the Emperor
has been discovered in the Imperial library at Vienna. Of
this I have subjoined some account at the close of the Notes
to the third volume. The second dispatch, dated Odober
o3th, 1520, was published at Seville, A. D. 1522, anti
the third and fourth soon after they were received. A
Latin translation of them appeared in Germany, A. D.
15 2. Ramulio soon after made them more generally
known, by inserting them in his valuable collection. They
contain a regular andi minute history of the expedition,
with many curious pa;rticulars concerning the policy and
nanners of the lMcxicaLs; . The work does honor to Cortes;
the flyle is (imple and perspicuous; but as it was maniteftl)
his interest to represent his own actions in the fiircft light,
his victories are probably exagcrated, his lofIcs dinm-

nifihed, and s adts of rigor and violence somewhat
Softened.

The next in order is the Chronica de la Nueva EfpagnR,

by Francisco Lopez de (;omara, published A. D. 1 54.
Gomara's historical merit is considerable. His mode of
narration is clear, flowing, always agreeable, and sometimes
elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate and credulous;
and as he was the domestic chaplain of Cortes after his
return from New Spain, and probably composed his work
at his delire, it is manifest that he labors to magnify the
merit of his hero, and to conceal or extenuate such
tranfadtions as were unfavorable to his character. Of this
jlerrera accuses him in one instance, Dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 2.
all it is not once only that this is conspicuous. He
writes, however, with so much freedom concerning several
r/.eafures of the Spaniih court, that the copies both of his
Hiltoria de las Indias, and of his Chronica, were called in
by a decree of the council of the Indies, and they were
long confidered as prohibited books in Spain; it is only of
late that licence to print them has been granted. Pinelo
Biblioth. s 89.

The Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz dol

CafRillo to compose his Hiftoria Verdadera de la Conquifta
de la Nueva Efpagna. He had been an adventurer in each
of the expeditions to New Spain, and was the companion
of Cortes in all his battles and perils. When he found
that neither he himself, nor many of his fellow-foldiers,
were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the faime of all
their exploits was ascribed to Cortes; the gallant veteran
laid hold of his pen with indignation, and composed his
true hiltory. It contains a prolix, minute, confured
narrative of all Cortes's operations, in such a rude vulgkr
Itylc as might be expected from an illiterate soldier. But
as he relates tranfachions of which he was witness, and in
1 hich he performed a considerable part, his account bears
all the marls of authenticity, and is accompanied with such
a plcuafalt naivetd, with such interesting details, with fucL
ilmuling vanity, and yet so pardonable in an old foldicr wh9

Fs ;

had been (as he boasts) in a hundred an ineteen battles,
as renders his book one of the mot singular that is to be
found in any language.

Pet. Martyr ab Angleria, in a treatise de Infulis nuper

inventis, added to his Decades de Rebus Oceanicis & Novo
Orbe, gives some account of Cortes's expedition. But he
proceeds no farther than to relate what happened after his
.firit landing. This work, which is brief and flight, seems
to contain the information transmitted by Cortes in his
firit dispatches, embellished with several particulars com-
municated to the author by the officers who brought the
letters from Cortes.

But the book to which the greater part of modern hit.

torians have had recourse for information concerning the
conquest of New Spain, is Hiftoria de la Conquifta de
Mexico, por D. Antonio de Solis, first publithed A. D.
1684. I know no author in any language whose literary
fame has risen so far beyond his real merit. De Solis is
reckoned by his countrymen one of the purest writers in
the Castilian tongue; and if a foreigner may venture to
give his opinion concerning a matter of which Spaniards
alone are qualified to judge, he is entitled to that praise.
But, though his language be correct, his taste in compofi-
tion is far from being just His periods are so much
labored as to be often stiff, and sometimes tumid; the
figures which he emplolys by way of ornament, are trite
or improper, and his observations superficial. These
blemishes, however, might easily be overlooked, if he were
not defeeive with refpest to all the great qualities of a
historian. Destitute of that patient industry in research,
which conducts to the knowledge of truth; a stranger to
that impartiality which weighs evidence with cool attention
and ever eager to establish his favorite system of exalting
the character of Cortes into that of a perfec hero, exempt
from error, and adorned with every virtue; he is less
Solicitous to discover what was true, than to relate what
might appear splendid. When he attempts any critical
difcuflion, his reasonings are fallacious, and founded upon

an imperfec vicv of fadrs. Though he sometimes quotes
the diJpatches of Cortes, he seems not to have consulted
them; and though he sets out with some censure on
Gomara, he frequently prefers his authority, the molt
doubtful of any, to that of the other contemporary
historians.

But of all the Spanish writers, Herrera furnishes the

fullest and moit accurate information concerning the conquest
of Mexico, as well as every other tranfadion of America.
The industry and attention with which he consulted not
only the books, but the original papers and public records,
which tended to throw any light upon the subjed of his
inquiries, were so great, and he usually judges of the
evidence before him with so much impartiality and candor,
that his decads may be ranked among the most judicious
and useful historical collections. If, by attempting to
relate the various occurrences in the New World in a
firid chronological order, the arrangement of events in
his work had not been rendered so perplexed, difconneded,
and obscure, that it is an umpleafant talk to collet from
different parts of his book, and piece together the detached
shreds of a sTory, he might justly have been ranked among
the most eminent historians of his country. He gives an
account of the materials from which he composed his work,
Dec. vi. lib. iii. c. 19.

CORTES purposed to have gone in the train of Ovando
when he set out for his government in the year t0o2,
but was detained by an accident. As he was attempting
in a dark night to scramble up to the window of a lady's
bed-chamber, with whom he carried on an intrigue, an
old wall, on the top of which he had mounted, gave
way, and he was so much bruised by the fall as to be
unfit for the voyage. Gomara, Chronica de la Nueva

N those different conflics, the Spaniards loft only two

men , but had a confidcrable number wounded. Though
there be no occasion for recourse to any supernatural cause
to account either for the greatness of their victories, or the
fimallnefs of their loss; the Spanish historians fail not to
ascribe b:nth to the patronage of St. Jago, the tutelar
Saint of their country, who , as they relate, fought at the
head of their countrymen, and by his prowess gave a turn
to the fate of the battle. Gomara is the firlt who men.
tions this apparition of St. James. It is amusing to obfervo

the embarraflirent of B. Diaz de Castillo, occasioned by
the itruggle between his fuperflition and his veracity. The
former disposed him to believe this miracle, the latter re.
strained him from attesting it. " I acknowledge, fays he,
that all our exploits and victories are owing to our Lord
Jesus Christ, and that in this battle there was such a num.
ber of Indians to every one of us, that if each had thrown
a handful of earth they imight have buried us, if by the
great mercy of God we had not been protected. It may
be that the person whom Gomara mentions as having ap.
peared on a mottled grey horse, was the glorious apostle
Signor San Jago or Signor San Pedro; and that I, as
being a finner, was not worthy to fee him. This I know,
that I saw Francifca de Morla on such a horse, but as an
unworthy transgressor, did not deserve to fee any of the
holy apostles. It may have been the will of God, that it
was so as Gomara relates, but until I read his Chronicle I
never heard among any of the conquerors that such a thing
had happened. " Cap. ;4.

NOTE LXXV. p. 227.

SEVERAL Spanish historians relate this occurrence in
such terms, as if they wished it should be believed, that
the Indians, loaded with the presents, had carried them
from the capital in the fame short space of time that the
couriers performed that journey. This is incredible, and
Comara mentions a circumtlance which shows, that nothing
extraordinary happened on this occasion. This rich present
had been prepared for Crijalva, when he touched at the
fime place tome months before, and was now ready to
be delivered, as soon as Montezuma sent orders for that
purpose. Gomara, Chron. c. xxvii. p. 28.

According to B. )iaz del Caflillo, the value of the

THIS private traffic was directly contrary to the in.
ftructions of Velasquez, who enjoined, that whatever was
acquired by trade should be thrown into the common flock.
But it appears , that the soldiers had each a private assortment
of toys, and other goods proper for the Indian trade, and
Cortes gained their favor by encouraging this under-hand
barter. B. Diaz, c. 41.

GOOMARA has published a catalogue of the various ar.
tides of which this present consisted. Chron. c. 49. P.

as it conveys Come idea of the progress which the Mexicans
had made in several arts of elegance. De Infulis nuper

NOTE LXXVIII. p. z4.

T HERE is no circumstance in the history of the conquest
of America, which is more questionable than the account
of the numerous armies brought into the field against the
Spaniards. As the war with the Tlafcalans, though of
short duration, was one of the most considerable which the
Spaniards waged in America, the account given of the forces
of their enemies merits some attention. The only authentic
information concerning this is derived from three authors.
Cortes, in his second dispatch to the emperor, dated at
Segura de la Frontera, Odtober 0 , i s2o, thus eftimateo
the number of their troops; in the first battle 6ooo; in
the second battle loo,ooo; in the third battle x$o,ooo-

Relaz. ap. Ramus. iii. 236. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who
was an eye-witness, and engaged in all the actions of this
war, thus reckons their numbers; in the first battle
0ooo, p. 43; in the second battle, 6000 ibid. in the
third battle So,ooo , p. 45. Gomara , who was
Cortes's chaplain after his return to Spain, and published
his Chronica in x 5 2, follows the computation of Cortes,
except in the second battle, where he reckons the Tlafcalans
at 80,000, p. 49. It was manifefily the interest of Cortes
to magnify his own dangers and exploits. For it was only
by the merit of extraordinary services, that he could hope
toatone for his irregular condut, in assuming an independ-
ent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundantly disposed
to place his own prowess, and that of his fellow-conquerors,
in the most advantageous point of light, had not the fame
temptation to exaggerate; and, it is probable, that his
account of the numbers approaches nearer to the truth.
The assembling of an army of I o,ooo men requires marn
previous arrangements, and such provision for their
subsistence as seems to be beyond the foresight of Americans.
The degree of cultivation in Tlafcala does not seem to
have been so great, as to have furniflled such a vast
army with provisions. Though this province was so much better
cultivated than other regions of New Spain , that it was
called the country of bread; yet the Spaniards in their
march suffered such want, that they were obliged to subsist
upon Tunas, a species of fruit which grows wild in the
fields. Ilerrera, Dec. ii. lib. vi. c. S. p. 182.

NOTE LXXIX. p. 2z8.

TIIESE unhappy victims are said to be persons of
diftintion. It seems improbable that so great a number
as fifty should be employed as spies. So many prisoners
had been taken and dismissed, and the Tlafcalans had
sent so many meflages to the Spanish quarters, that there
appears to be no reason for hazarding the lives of so many

considerable people, in order to procure information about
the position and itate of their camp. The barbarous manner
in which Cortes treated a people unacquainted with the laws
of war eltablifhed among polished nations, appears so
flocking to the later Spanish writers, that they diminish
the number of those whom he punished Cb cruelly. Herrera
fays, that he cut off the hands of seven, and thumbs of
some more. Dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 8. De Solis relates, that
the hands of fourteen or fifteen were cut off, and the
thumbs of all the reft. Lib. ii. c. 20. But Cortes himself,
Relaz. p. 228, b. and after him Gomara, c. 48, affirm,
that the hands of all the fifty were cut off.

NOTE LXXX. p. 261.

THE horses were objects of the greteft aifonifhment to
all the people of New Spain. At first they imagined the
horse and his rider, like the Centaurs of the ancients, to
be some monstrous animal of a terrible form; and fuppoting,
that their food was the fame as that of men, brought
flesh and bread to nourish them. Even after they discovered
their mistake, they believed the horses devoured men in
battle, and when they neighed, thought that they were
demanding their prey. It was not the interest of the
Spaniards to undeceive them. Herrcra, dec. ii. lib. vi.
C. 11.

NOTE LXXX. p. 267.

A CCORDING to Bart. de las Casas, there was no reafnn
for this ma;tacre, and it was an aOt of wanton cruelty,
perpetrated merely to strike terror into the people of Ne't
Spain. Relaz. de la Deftrucc. p. 17, &c. But the zeal
of Las Casas often leads him to exaggerate. In oppolitior
to him Bern. Diaz, c. 8 , asserts , that the first miilionaric'
sent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial inquirl

into this tranfadtion; and having examined the priests and
elders of Cholula, found that there was a real conspiracy
to cut off the Spaniards, and that the account given by
Cortes was exactly true. As it was the object of Cortes
at that time, and manifestly his interest, to gain the good.
will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that he should have
taken a ftep which tended so visibly to alienate him from
the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to be necessary
for his own preservation. At the fame time, the Spaniards
who served in America had such contempt for the natives,
and thought them lb little entitled to the common rights of
men, that Cortes might hold the Cholulans to be guilty
upon flight and imperfect evidence. The severity of the
puniflunent was certainly excessive and atrocious.

NOTE LXXXII. p. 268.

THIS description is taken almost literally from Bernal
Diaz del Castillo, who was so unacquainted with the art of
composition, as to be incapable ofembellifling his narrative.
lie relates in a simple and rude style what passed in his
own mind, and that of his fellow-foldiers, on that
ocation; "c And let it not be thought firange, fays he,
that I should write in this manner of what then hap-
pened, for it ought to be confidered, that it is one thing
to relate, another to have beheld things that were never
before seen, or heard, or spoken of among men." Cap. 86.
p. 64., b.

NOTE LXXXIII. p. 281.

B. Diaz del Castillo gives us some idea of the fatigue
and hardflips they underwent in performing this, and
other parts of duty. During the nine months that they
rinained in Mexico, every man, without any diltindion
betwven officers and foldicrs, lept on his arms , in his

quilted jacket and gorget. They lay on mats, or firawl
spread on the floor, and each was obliged to hold himself
as alert as if he had been on guard. "This, adds he,
became so habitual to me, that even now in my advanced
age, I always sleep in my clothes, and never in any bed.
'XWhen I visit my Encomienda, I reckon it suitable to my
rank, to have a bed carried along with my. other baggage,
but I never go into it; but, according to custom, I lie in
my clothes, and walk frequently during the night into the
open air, to view the stars as I was wont when in service."

NOTE LXXXIV. p. 284.

CORTES himself, in his second dispatch to the emperor,
does not explain the motives which induced him either to
condemn Qualpopoca to the flames, or to put Montezuma
in irons. Ramus. iii. 2 6. B. Diaz is silent with refpee
to his reasons for the former; and the only cause he assigns
for the latter was, that he might meet with no interruption
in executing the sentence pronounced against Qualpopoca,
c. xcv. p. 7s. But as lontezuma was his prisoner, and
absolutely in his power, he had no reason to dread him,
aid the insult offered to that monarch could have no effed
but to irritate him unnecessarily. Gomara supposes, that
Cortes had no other objet than to occupy Montezuma
*with his own distress and sufferings, that he might give less
attention to what besel Qualpopoca. Chron. c. 89. Herreri
adopts the fame opinion. Dec. ii, lib. viii. c. 9. But i{
seems an odd expedient, in order to make a persons beat
one injury, to load him with another that is greater. De
Solis imagines , that Cortes had nothing else in view than
to intimidate Montezuma, so that he might make nO
attempt to rescue the victims from their fate; but thd
spirit of that monarch was fTo fuhmifrive, and he had so tameCl
given up the prisoners to the difpoall of Cortes, that he
had no cause to apprehend any opporitioi from him. II

the explanation which I have attempted to give of Cortes's
proceedings on this occasion be not admitted, it appears
to me, that they must be reckoned among the wanton
and barbarous ads of opprefion which occur too often in
the history of the conquest of America.

X NOTE LXXXV. p. 289.

D E Solis afTerts, lib. iv. c. 7. that the proposition of
doing homage to the King of Spain, came from Mlontezuma
]imfelf, and was made in order to induce the Spaniards to
depart out of his dominions. He describes his condud on
this occasion, as if it had been founded upon a scheme of
profound policy, and executed with such refined address,
as to deceive Cortes himself. But there is no hint or
circumstance in the contemporary historians, Cortes, Diaz,
or Gomara, to justify this theory. sMontezuma, on other
occasions, discovered no such extent of art and abilities.
The anguish which he felt in performing this humbling
ceremony is natural, if we suppose it to have been
involuntary. But, according to the theory of De Solis,
which supposes that Montezuma was executing what he
himself had proposed, to have assumed an appearance of
sorrow, would have been preposterous and inconfiflent with his
ewn design of deceiving the Spaniards.

NOTE LXXXVI. p. 292.

IN several of the provinces, the Spaniards, with all their
industry and influence, could colled no gold. In others,
they procured only a few trinkets offmall value. IAlontezuma
allured Cortes, that the present which he offered
to the King of Caffile, after doirng homage, conlriled of all
the treasure amafTed by his father; and told him, that
he had already difrributed the reft of his gold and jewels
atong the Spaniards.. B. Diaz, c. 104. Comara relates,

that all the silver collected amounted to soo marks. Chron;
c. 9;. This agrees with the account given by Cortes,
that the royal fifth of silver was oo marks. Relaz. 2 9, B.
So that the fum total of silver was only 4000 ounces, at
the rate of eight ounces a mark, which demonfirates
the proportion of silver to gold to have been exceedingly
finall.

NOTE LXXXVII p. 29.

D E Solis, lib. iv. c. i. calls in queltion the truth of
this tranfation, from no better reafun than that it was
inconsistent with that prudence which dillinguifhes the
character of Cortes. But he ought to have recolledted
the impetuosity of his zeal at Tlafcala, which was no less
imprudent. He aflerts, that the evidence for it refts upon
the tellimony of B. Diaz del Caflillo, of Gomara, and of
Herrera. They all concur, indeed, in mentioning this
inconliderahle ftep which Cortes took; and they had good
reason to do so, for Cortes himself relates this exploit in
his second dispatch to the Emperor, and seems to glory in
it. Cort. Relaz. Ramus. iii. 40o, D. This is one instance,
among many, of De Solis's having consulted with little
attention the letters of Cortes to Charles V. from which
the imolt authentic information with respect to his operations
must be derived.

H ERRERA and De Solis suppose, that Velasquez wa

accounts which he received from Spain concerning the

c; ;. But the chronological order of events refutes this
supposition. Portocarrero and Montejo failed from Vera
Cruz, July 26, I 19. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4,
They landed at St. Lucar in OCtober, according to Herrera,
ibid. But P. Martyr, who attended the court at that
time, and communicated every occurrence of moment to
his correspondents day by day, mentions the arrival of
there agents, for the first time, in December, and speaks
of it as a recent event. Epift. 6;o. All the hifturians
agree, that the agents of Cortes had their firit audience of
the Emperor at Tordefillas, when he went to that tpwn
to vift his mother in his way to St. Jago de Compoftella.
Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. De Solis , lib. iv. c. a.
But the emperor set out from Valladolid for Tordefillas,
on the i th of March 120o; and P. Martyr mentions his

Cuba in April i52o. It is manifest then, that Velasquez
could not receive any account of what passed in this
interview at Tordefillas, previous to his hofrile preparations
againit Cortes. His real motives seem to be those which I
have mentioned. The patent appointing him Adelnzttado
of New Spain, with such extenlive powers, bears date

D ES Solis contends that as Narvaez had no interpreters,
he could hold no intercoutrfe with the people of thle
prUvinces , nor converse with them in any way but by signs,
and that it was equally impollible for him to carry on aill
Crlnlnunication with AIontezunma. Iih. iv. c. 7. ;ut it is

was a mode of intcrcourfe between Narvaez and the

Bernal Diaz supplies this defect, and informs us, that the
three deCertcrs u ho joined Narvaez acted as interpreters,
having acquired a competent knowledge of the language,
c. t o. Y\'ich his usual minuteners, he mentions their
nanes a-d character s, and relates, in chapter 122,
liow they were punished for their perfidy. The Spaniards
had now relicd above a year among the MAexicans; and it
is not furpriiing, that several among them should have made
Ibme proficiency in speaking their language. This seems
to have been the cafe. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. r.
1Both B. Diaz, who was present, and Herrera, the molf
accurate and best informed of all the Spanish writers, agree
with Cortes in his account of the secret correspondence
carried on with Montezuma. Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 8,
19. De Solis seems to confider it as a discredit to Cortes,
his hero, that Montezuma should have been ready to
engage in a correfpondencc with Narvaez. lie supposes
that monarch to have contracted such a wonderful
affection for the Spaniards, that he iwas not solicitous to
be delivered from them. After the indignity with which
he had been treated, such an affecion is incredible; and
even De Solis is obliged to acknowledge, that it must be
looked upon as one of the miracles which God had
wurought to facilitate the conquest, lib. iv. c. 7. The
truth is, Mlonte7uma, however much overawed by his
dread ,f the Spaniards, was extremely impatient to recover
his libcity.

and their flesh devoured by their exulting enemies; I was
accustomed to enter a battle not only without fear, but
with high spirit. But from that time I never advanced to
fight the Alexicans without a fccret horror and anxiety;
my heart trembled at the thoughts of the death which I
had seen them fulTer." He takes care to add, that
as soon as the combat began, his terror went off; and,
indeed, his adventurous bravery on every occasion is full
evidence of this. B. Diaz, c. 1 6. p. 17, a.

O JE circumrtance in this siege merits particular notice.
The account which the Spanish writers give of the numerous
armics elnployed in the attack or defence of Mexico,

seems to be incredible. According to Cortes himself, he
had at one time i o,ooo auxiliary Indians in his service.
Relaz Ramus. iii. 27 , E. Gomara aflerts, that they were
above 200,000. Chron. c. 136. Herrera, an author of
higher authority, fays, they were about 20oo,ooo. Dec. iii.
lib. i. c. 19. None of the contemporary writers ascertain
explicirly the number of persons in Mexico during the siege.
But Cortes on several occasions mentions the number of
Mexicans who were slain, or who perished for want of
food; and, if we may rely on those circumltances, it is
probable, that above two hundred thousand muff have
been shut up in the town. But the quantity of provisions
necessary for the subsistence of such vast multitudes assembled
in one place during three months, is so great, and it
requires so much forelight and arrangement to collect there,
and lay them up in magazines, tb as to be certain of a
regular supply, that one can hardly believe that this could
be accomplified in a country where agriculture was so
imperfect as in the Mexican empire, where there were no
tame animals, and by a people naturally so improvident,
and so incapable of executing a complicated plan as the
most improved Americans. The Spaniards, with all their
care and attention, fared very poorly, and were often
reduced to extreme distress for want of provilions. B. Diaz,
p. 142. Cortes, Relaz. 271, D. Cortes on one occasion
mentions slightly the fubliftence of his army; and after
acknowledging, that they were often in great want, adds,
that they received supplies from the people of the country,
of fiif , and of some fruit, which he calls the cherries of
the country. Ibid. 13. )iaz fays , that they had cakes of
nlai/c, and cerafas de la tierra; and when the season of
there was over, another fruit, which he calls 7Titas; but
their most comfortable fubliitence was a root which the
Indians life as food, to which he gives the name of Quilites,
p. 142. The Indian auxiliaries had one means of fubfittence
more than the Spaniards, They fed upon the bodies of tie
lmexicans whom they killed in battle. Cort. Relaz. 176, C.
B. Diaz confirms his relation, and adds, that when the

Indians returned from Mexico to their own country, they
carried with them large quantities of the flesh of the
Mexicans salted or dried, as a mos acceptable present to
their friends , that they might have the pleasure of feeding
upon the bodies of their enemies in their feltivals. P. i17.
I)e Solis, who seems to confider it as an imputation of
discredit to his countrymen, that they fllould ad in concert
with auxiliaries who fed upon human fleh , is solicitous
to prove, that the Spaniards endeavoured to prevent their
affocintcs from eating the bodies of the Alexicans, lib. v.
24. But he has no authority fur this from the original
historians. Neither Cortes himself, nor B. Diaz, seem to
have had any such scruple; and, on many occasions,
mention the Indian repass , which were become familiar
to them, without any mark of abhorrence. Even with this
additional stock of food for the Indians, it was hardly
pollible to procure subsistence for armies amounting to such
numbers as we find in the Spanish writers. Perhaps the
bcft solution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of
B. Diaz del Castillo; the mofl artless of all the Hifioridores
primitivol. " When Gomara (fays he), on some occasions,
relates, that there were so many thousand Indians our
auxiliaries, and on others, that there were so many
thousand houses in this or that town , no regard is to be
paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the
numbers not being in reality the fifth of what he relates.
If we add together the different numbers which he men-
tions, that country would contain more millions than there
are In Cafie. " C. 129. But though some considerable
deduction ihould certainly be made from the Spanish
accounts of the Mexican forces, they must have been very
numerous; for nothing but an immense superiority in
number could have'enabled them to withstand a body of
nine hundred Spaniards, conduced by a leader of such
abilities as Curtes.

IN relating the opprefflve and cruel proceedings of the
conquerors of New Spain, I have not followed B. de las
Casas as my guide. His account of them, Relac. de la
)eftrucc. p. iS , &c. is manifefily exaggerated. It is from
the teltimony of Cortes himself and of Gomara, who wrote
under his eye, that I have taken my account of the
punifliment of the Panucans, and they relate it without
any disapprobation. B. Diaz, contrary to his usual cullom,
mentions it only in general terms, c. 62. Herrera,
solicitous to extenuate this barbarous aAion of his country-
men, though he mentions 60 caziques, and 400 men of
note, as being condemned to the flames, alferts, that
thirty only were burnt, and the reft pardoned. Dec. iii.
lib. v. c. 7. But this is contrary to the testimony of the
original historians, particularly of Gomara, whom it appears
he had consulted, as he adopts several of his exprellions
in this passage. The punifshment of Guatimozin is related
by the molt authentic of the Spanish writers. Torquemada
has extracted from a hiflory of Tezeuco, compored in the
Mexican tongue, an account of this tranfadtion, more
favorable to Guatimozin than that of the Spanish authors.
M1n. Indiana, i. 7a. According to the Mexican account,
Cortes had scarcely a shadow of evidence to justify such a
vanton act of cruelty. B. Diaz affirms, that Guatimozin
and his fellow-fufllerers afterted their innocence with their
last breatll, and that many of the Spanill soldiers condemn-
ed this atlion of Cortes as equally unneceil:ry and unjult,
p. 2oo00, b. 201o, a.

Tti E motive for undertaking this expedition sias, to
punifl Chriftoval de Olid , one of his officers, who hadt
revolted againfi himn and aimed ia cltahlilhing an ii.depeild-

ent jurifdidiion. Cortes regarded this infurrecion as of
such dangerous example, and dreaded ol much the abilities
and popularity of its author, that in person he led the
body of troops deltined to fupprefR it. He marched,
according to Gomara, three thousand miles, through a
country abounding with thick forefis, rugged mountains,
deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and cultivated only in a few
places. W\hat he fulfered from famine, from the hostility of
the natives, from the climate, and from hardships of every
species, has nothing in history parallel to it, but what occurs
in the adventures of the other discoverers and conquerors
of the New World. Cortes was employed in this dreadful
service above two years, and though it was not distinguished
by any splendid event, he exhibited, during the course of
it, greater personal courage, more fortitude of mind, more
perseverance and patience, than in any other period or
scene in his life. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. vi. vii. viii. ix.
Gomara Chron. c. 163-177. B. Diaz, I74-I9o . Cortes,
MS. penes mle. Were o.e to write a life of Cortes, the
account of this expedition flould occuly a splendid place
in it. In a general history of America, as the expedition
was productive of no great event, the mention of it is
fuflicient.

A CCORDING to Ilerrera, the treasure which Cortes
brought with him, coniflted of fifteen hundred marlts
of wrought plate, two hundred thousand pesos of
fine gold, and ten thoufhnd of inferior standard, many
rich jewels, one in particular worth forty thoufcnd
pesos, and fevcral trinkets and ornaments of value. Dec.
iv. lib. iii. c. 8. lib. iv. c. i. He afterwards cng;!ged to
give a portion with his daughter of a hundred thousand
pesos. Gomara, Chron. c. 2 7. The fortune which he left
his Tons was very confidcrable. But, as we have before
relatel, the film divided among the conquerors on the first
reduction of Mexico was very finall. There appears then

to he some reason for furpeLting that the accusations of
Cortes's enemies were not altogether deflitute of foundation.
They charged him with- having applied to his own use a
disproportionate share of the Mlexican spoils; with having
concealed the royal treasures of Montezumra and Guatimozin;
with defrauding the king of his fifth; and robbing his
followers of what was due to them. Herrera, dec. iii.
lib. viii. c. I . dec. iv. lib. iii. c. 8. Some of the
conquerors themselves entertained suspicions of the fame
kind. B. Diaz, c. 157.
