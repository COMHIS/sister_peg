# PREFACE.

PRESA C E.

N fulfilling the engagement which I had
come under to the Public with refped

to the History of America, it was my in-
tention not to have publiihed any part of
the work until the whole was completed.
The present state of the British Colonies has
induced me to alter that resolution. While
they are engaged in civil war with Great
Britain, inquiries and speculations concern-
ing their ancient forms of policy and laws,
which exist no longer, cannot be interest-
ing. The attention and expectation of
mankind are now turned towards their fu-
ture condition. In whatever manner this
unhappy contest may terminate, a new or-
der of things must arise in North America,
and its affairs will assume another asped.
I wait, with the solicitude of a good citizen;
until the ferment subside, and regular go-

A 3 vernment

rermn.ent e "re-efiabnlired, and then Ilhall-
return to this part df-ry rwork, in which I-
had made some -prbgr'fs. That, together
with the history of ortuguefe America, and
of the settlements made by the several na-
tions of Europe in the Weft India islands,
will complete my plan.

THa three voumens which I now pubffil,

contain an account of the discovery of the
New World, and of the progress of the Spa-
nifh arms and colonies there. This is not
only the meft splendid portion of the Ame-
rican tory, but so much detached, as, by
itfeif, to form a perfect whole, remarkable
for the unity of the fubjecd. As the prin-
ciples and maxims of the Spaniards in plant-
ing colonies, which have been adopted in
some reafure by every nation, are unfolded
in this part of my work; it will serve as a
proper intrcduaion to the history of all the
European eflablifments in America, and
convey such information concerning this
important article of policy, as may be
deemed no less intereaing than curious.

IN\

IN dfcribing Utfi ^ghieyement%..,jn-

flitutions of the Spa'ia rs in the New W.o,.
I have dep.ated inljany.inftan.es from the
accounts of precedi. ghiforians% and have
often related faas wmhich fcem to have been
unknown to them. At is a duty I owe the
Public, to mention the sources from which
I have derived such intelligence, as justifies
me either in placing tranfaaions in a new
light, or in forming any new opinion with
refpe& to their causes and effeds. This
duty I perform with greater fatisfadion,. as
it will afford an opportunity of expressing
my gratitude to those benefaaors, who
have honoured me with their countenance
and aid in my researches.

As it was from Spain that I had to exe

pea the most important information, with
regard to this part of my work, I confidered
it as a very fortunate circumstance for me,
when Lord Grautham, to whom I.had the
honour of being personally known, aind
with whose liberality of sentiment, and dif-
position to oblige, I was well acquainted,

A 4 was

was- appoianctaifilao or to theFomurt.of
Madid: rflLTpa;Eapptlpyig to him,. I met
width fbura-e feeptioni as satisfied nie that
eha odeavosfs wourii be. employed in the
roft proper manr=,,, in rorder to obtain the
gratification of my wifthes; and I am per-
fetly sensible, that what progress I-have
made in my inquiries among the Spaniards,
ought to be akcribed chiefly to their know-
ing how much his Lordihip interested him-
self in my success. i

BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord

Grantham, than the advantages which I
have derived from his attention in engaging
Air. Waddilove, the chaplain of his em-
balv, to take the conduct of my literary
inquiries in Spain, the obligations I lie un-
der to him would be very great. During
live -ears, that gentleman has carried on
recearches for my behoof, with such ac-
tivitv, perseverance, and knowledge of the
subjec&, to which his attention was turned,
as have filled me with no lets aitonilhment
than fatisfsctioi. lHe procured for me the

greater

greater part of the)S&nifh-bdok;sjwhitch .'
have consulted; andi-asmariy of'theiWe'
printed early in the fixteinth century, and
are become extremely rare; the collecting
of these was such an occupation, as, alone,
required much time and assiduity. To his
frienily attention I am indebted for copies
of several valuable manuscripts, containing
fads and details which I might have searched
for in vain, in works that have been made
public. Encouraged by the inviting good-
will with which Mr. Waddilove conferred
his favours, I transmitted to him a set of
queries, with refped both to the customs
and policy of the native Americans, and'
the nature of several institutions in the Spa-
nith settlements, framed in such a manner,
that a Spaniard might answer them, with-
nut disclosing any thing that was improper
to be communicated to..a foreigner. He
trnnflated there into Spanish, and obtained
from various persons who had resided in
molt of the Spanish colonies, such replies
:; have afforded me much infiruLtion.

NOT-

iNOTWITRSiTAKNDUNG those peculiar ad-

rantages with. which my inquiries were
carried on in Spain, it is with regret I am
obliged to add, that their success inuft be
aferibed to the beneficence of individuals,
not to any communication by public au-
thority. By a singular arrangement of
Philip II. the records of the Spaniff mo-
uarchy are deposited in the -rchivo of Si-
mancas, near Valladolid, at the distance of
a hundred and twenty miles from the feat
of government, and the supreme courts of
justice. The papers relative to America,
and chiefly to that early period of its his-
tory, towards which my attention was di-
re&ed, are lo numerous, that they aloneg
according to one account, fill the largest
apartment in the Archivo; and according
to another, they compole eight hundred and
feventv-three large bundles. Conscious of
possesing, in rome degree, the industry
which belongs to an historian, the prospect
of such a treasure excited my most ardent
curiosity. But the prospect of it, is all that

I have

I have enjoyed. - Sairi,'wtt'rii eicefs of
caution, has -iiforntly)'thiown (a veil' 6Yer
her tranfa&ions- in' America, From firan-
gers they are concealed with. peculiar fii
citude. Even to her own fabjets the Ar-
chivo of Simancas is not opened without a
particular order from the crown; and after
obtaining that, papers cannot be copied,
without paying fees of office so exorbitant,
that the expence exceeds what it would be
proper to betlow, when the gratification of
literary curiosity is the only object. It is to
be hoped, that the Spaniards will at last dif-
cover this system of concealment to be no
less impolitic than illiber-aL From what I
have experienced in the course of my in-
quiries, I am fitisfied, that upon a. more
minute fcrutiy into their early operations
in the New World, however reprehensible
tlhe acions of individuals may appear, the
ccnduct of the nation will. be placed in a
more favourable light.

IN other parts of Europe very different
feulimentt prevail. Having searched, with-

out success, in Spain, for a letter of Corteg
to' Charlesfr' wriittdn:ifoon after he hrdred
in: the Mexican :empire, !which has not hi-.
tset to been ptbliifhed X it occurted to tfirj
that as the emperor was setting out for Ger-
nmanv, at the time when the meffehgers
from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter
with which they were intrusted might pof-
iiblv be preserved in the Imperial Library
of Vienna. I communicated this idea to
Sir Robert Murrav Keith, with whiom I
have long had the honour to live in friend-
ship, and I had soon the pleasure to learns
that, upon his application, her Imperial
Majefh- had been eracioufly pleated to iflue
an order, that not only a copy of that letter
(if it were found), but of any other papers
in the library, which could throw light up-
on the History of America, should be tranlf-
mitted to me. The letter from Cortes is
nor in the Imperial Library, but an authen-
tic copy, attefced by a notary, of that writ-
ten by the magistrates of the colony planted
by him at Vera Cruz, which I have men-
tioned, Vol. ii. p. 291, having been found

I received a copy. of a letter from Cortes,
containing a long account of his expedition
to Honduras, with refpedt to which, I did
not think it necessary to enter into any par-
ticular detail; and likewise those curious
MIexican paintings, which I have describe'd,
vol. iii. p. 200.

MyI inquiries at St. Peterfburgh .were

carried on with equal facility and success.
In cxanining into the nearest communica-
tinl between our continent and thatofAme-
rica, it became of con.sequence to obtain
autlientic information concerning the dif-
c(\'vcrics of the Ruffians in their navigation
from Kamnchatka towards the coast of Ame-:

rica.

rica. Accurate, r4ations of their ,firlt
voyage, in 1741, have been publiihe;, :by
Muller andGmelin. Several foreign authors
have entertained an opinion, that the court
of Ruflia studiously conceals the progress
which has been made by more recent na-
vigators, and suffers the Public to be amused
with false accounts of their route. Such
condua appeared to me unsuitable to those
liberal sentiments, and that patronage of
science, for which the present sovereign of
Rufia is eminent; nor could I discern any
political reason, that might render it im-
proper to apply for information concerning
the late attempts of the Ruffians to open a
communication between Asia and America.
My. ingenious countryman, Dr. Rogerfon,
first physician to the Empress, presented my
request to her Imperial Majesty, who not
only duclaimed any idea of concealment,
but instantly ordered the journal of Captain
Krenitzin, who conduated the only voyage
of discovery made by public authority since
the year I741, to be traniated, and his ori-

ginal

gitial chart to be c'ti4d: f.'&-myibfe. ,'B

give a more accurate *view- 6f' th'e 'prOfess
and extent of the R'lffiAn t iisir;es tfhan
has hitherto been" eorhmUiitlcated to-' the
Public.

FROM other quarters I have received in-

formation of great utility and importance.
M. le Chevalier de Pinto,: the minifier-fidm
Portugal to the court of Great Biitain, who
commanded for several years at Matagroffo,
a iettlement of the Portuguese in the interior
part of Brasil, where the Indians are nu-
merous, and their original manners little
altered by intercourse with Europeans, was
pleased to fend me very full answers to some
queries concerning the character and infti-
tutions of the natives of Ameriea, which
his polite reception of an application made
to him in my naie, encouraged me topro-
pole. These satisfied me, that he had con-
templated with a diKerning attention the
curious olje¢ls whlk his situation presented

to

to bij _and lia often followed him
a.s i;of'nbefti inl~ffued guides.

. hose elegant translation

ps the History of the reign of Charles V.
I owe the reception of that work on the con-
tinent, procured me answers to the fame
queries from MI. rdeBougainville, who had
opportunities of observing the Indians both
of North and South America, and from M.
Godin le Jeune, who resided fifteen years
among Indians in Quito, and twenty years
in Cayenne. The latter are more valuable
from having been examined by M. de laCon-
damine, who, a few weeks before his death,
made some short additions to them, which
mai be confidered as the last effort of that
attention to science which occupied a long
life.

'IY inquiries were not confined to one

-egion in America. Governor Hutchinson
took the trouble of recommending the con-
fideration of my queries .to Mr. Hawley and

Mr.

Mr. Brainerd, two oe t nt .ieas
employed among tif d .ti i't'ive
Nations, who sav tied me ts' t. adtWers,
which discover a considerable knowledge of
the people whose customs they describe.
From William Smith, Efq; the ihgenious
hiflorian of New York, I received some use-
ful information. When I enter upon the
History of our Colonies in North America,
I shall have occasion to acknowledge how
much I have been indebted to many other
gentlemen of that country.

FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages

made by Alexander Dalrymple, Efq; with
whose attention to the History of Naviga-
tion and Discovery the Public is well ac-
quainted, I have received some very rare
books, particularly two large volumes of
Memorials, partly manuscript, and partly
in print, which were presented to the court
of Spain during the reigns of Philip III. and
Philip IV. From these I have learned many
curious particulars with refped to the inte-
rior fiate of the Spanish colonies, and-the

\VOL. I. a varioQs

various schemes formed for their improve-
ment. As this Colle&ion of Memorials
formerly belonged to the Colbert Library, I
have quoted them by that title.

ALL those books and manuscripts I have

consulted with that attention which the re-
tfpce due from an Author to the Public re-
quired ; and by minute references to them,
I have endeavoured to authenticate what-
ever I relate. The longer I rcflect on the
nature of historical composition, the more
I .;m convinced that this scrupulous accuracy
is neceflarv. The historian who records the
events of h;s own time, is credited in pro-
Fortion to the opinion which the Public en-
tertains with reipect to his means of inform-
.ac.n and his veracity. I-Ie who delineates
t:-c r-a.ln.tions of a recn-ute period, has no
ti'tle 'o claim assent, unlci he produces evi-
dence in proof of his affcrtions. Without
this, he may write an anmuling tale, but can-
not be laid to have compoted an authentic
ih;horvi . In those sentiments I have been
conlirmed by the opinion of an Author ;,

xvlhom

wion- is 1i ndHdAy, adie-
medi., hae defeie't placedi a aigh ran:
anmorg the most emilnent' htorians of theC
age. Emboldened' y a 4 rntl r'om lim,
havc published a catalogue of the Spanifli
books which I have consulted. This prac-
tice was frequent in the last century, and
confidered as an evidence of laudable in-
duftry in an author; in the present, it may,
perhaps, be deemed the effee of oftenta-
tion; but as many of these books are un-
known in Great Britain, I could not other-
wife have referred to them as authorities,
without encumbering the page with an in-
ftrtion of their full titles. To any person
who may chufe to follow, me in this path of
inquiry, the catalogue must be very useful.

My readers will observe, that in men-

tioning fums of money, I have uniformly
followed the Spaniff method of computing
by pcfos. In America, the peso fuerte, or
iar'o, is the only one known, and that is
always meant when any fum imported from
America is mentioned. The peso fuertc,

a 2 as

as well as other coins, has varied in its nu-
merary value, but I have been advised, with-
out attending to such minute variations, to
confider irts etfal M f our (hillings and'.ix
pence of our money. It is to be remem-
bered, however, that in the sixteenth cen-
tury, the effedive value of a peso, i. e. the
quantity of labour which it represented, or
of goods which it would purchase, was five
or fix times as much as at present.

H E progress of men in discovering and RooK I.
. peopling the various parts of the earth, L.u.-J

The earth

has been extremely flow. Several ages elapsed slowly po,
before they removed fat from those mild and
fertile regions where they were originally placed
by their Creator. The occasion of their first
general dispersion is known; but we are unac-
quainted with the course of their migrations, or
the time when they took poffefilon of the dif-
ferent countries which they now inhabit. Nei-
ther history nor tradition furnish such informa-
tion concerning those remote events, as enables
us to trace, with any certainty, the operations
of the human race in the infancy of society.

WE may conclude, however, that all the Sirs mi,.
early migrations of mankind were made by ,I' by

Boo. I. land. The ocean, which every-where fur-

rounds the habitable earth, as well as the va-
rious arms of the sea which separate one region
from another, though destined to facilitate the
communication between dilaant countries, seem,
at first view, to be formed to check the progress
of man, and to mark the bounds of that por-
tion of the globe to which nature had confinred
him. It was long, we may believe, before
men attempted to pals these formidable bar-
riers, and became so fkilfutl and adventrous as
to commit themselves to the mercy of the
winds and waves, or to quit their native shores
in qucft of remote and unknown regions.
r-.= l-. NA.VIGATION' and ship-building are arts so

.' _.';. nice and complicated, that they require the in-
n..... genuity, as well as experience, of many fuc-

ceflive ages to bring them to any degree of
perfection. From the raft or canoe, which first'
served to carry a savage over the river that
ebftruted him in the chace, to the conftruc-
tion of a vessel capable of conveying a nume-
rous crew with safety to a distant coast, the
progress in improvement is immense. Many
efforts would be made, many experiments
would be tried, and much labour as well as
invention would be employed, before men
could accomplish this arduous and important

undertaking. The rude and irnperfe& state in Boot 1.
which navigation is still found among all na-
tions which are not considerably civilized, cor-
responds with this account of its progress, and
demonstrates that, in early times, the art was
not so far improved as to enable men to un-
dertake distant voyages, or to attempt remote
discoveries.

As soon, however, as the art of navigation Intro,,e.

became known, a new species of correspondence tommrce.
among men took place. It is from this Era,
that we must date the commencement of such
an intercourse between nations as deserves the
appellation of commerce. Men are, indeed,
far advanced in improvement before commerce
becomes an obje&t of great importance to them.
They must even have made some considerable
progress towards civilization, before they ac-
quire the idea of property, and ascertain it so
perfectly, as to be acquainted with the most
simple of all contracts, that of exchanging by
barter one rude commodity for another. But
as soon as this important right is eftabliffed,
and every individual feels that he has an ex-
clufive title to possess or to alienate whatever
he has acquired by his own labour and dexte-
rity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature
liggeft to him a new method of increasing his

B 2 acquisitions

Bpor I. acquisitions and enjoyments, by disposing of
'' - what is superfluous in his own stores, in order

to procure what is necessary or desirable in
those of other men. Thus a commercial in-
tercourfe begins, and is carried on among the
members of the fame community. By degrees,
they discover that neighbouring tribes possess
what they themselves want, and enjoy comforts
of which they wish to partake. In the fame
mode, and upon the fame principles, that do-
melftic traffic is carried on within the society,
an external commerce is eflablifhed with other
tribes or nations. Their muttual interest and
mutual wants render this intercourse desirable,
and imperceptibly introduce the maxims and
Lws which facilitate its progress and render it
lfcure. But no very extensive commerce can
;'.ce place between contiguous provinces, whose
foil and climate being nearly the fame, yield
fimiiar productions. Remote countries cannot
convey their commodities by land, to those
places, where on account of their rarity they
are desired, and become valuable. It is to na-
vigation that men are indebted for the power of
tran.porting the superfluous stock of one part
of the earth, to supply the wants of another.
The luxuries and blefFigs of a particular cli-
mate arce no Longer confined to ki1'lf alone, but

the

the enjoyment of them is communicated to the BooK I.
most distant regions.

. IN proportion as the knowledge of the ad-
vantages derived from navigation and com-
merce continued to spread, the intercourse
among nations extended. The ambition of
copqueft, or the necessity of procuring new set-
tiements, were no longer the sole motives of
visiting distant lands. The desire of gain be-
came a new incentive to activity, rouied ad-
venturers, and sent them forth upon long voy-
ages, in search of countries, whose products or
wants might increase that circulation, which
nourishes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade
proved a great source of discovery, it opened
unknown seas, it penetrated into new regions,
and contributed more than any other cause, to
bring men acquainted with the situation, the
nature, and commodities of the different parts
of the globe. But even after a regular com-
merce was established in the world, after
nations were considerably civilized, and the
fcienccs and arts were cultivated with ardour
and success, navigation continued to be so im-
perse&, that it can hardly be said to have ad-
vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement
in the ancient world,

aticci.is.

of the great principles and operations in navi-
gation, which are now confidered as the sirs
elements on which that science is founded.
Though that property of the magnet, by which
it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients,
its more important and amazing virtue of
pointing to the poles had entirely escaped their
observation. Destitute of this faithful guide,
which now conducts the pilot with so much
certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the
darkness of night, and when the heavens are
covered with clouds, the ancients had no other
method of regulating their course than by ob-
fer-ing the Iun and liars. Their navigation
was of consequence uncertain and timid. They
dur2t felcom quit fight of land, but crept along
the coast, exposed to all the dangers, and re-
ta.rded by all the obftruc-ions, unavoidable in
ho!ling iuch an auk.ward course. An incre-
dible length of time was requisite for perform-
ing voyages, which are now finished in a fhiort
space. Even in the mildest climates, and in
seas the Ieaf tem.pef'ruous, it was only during
the fu mn:-rer months that the ancients ventured
out of their harbours. The remainder of the

year

year was loft in inactivity. It would have been BOOK I.
deemed most inconsiderate raffinefs to have
braved the fury of the winds and waves during
winter °.

WHILE both the science and pracice of na-

vigation continued to be so defective, it was an
undertaking of no small difficulty and danger
to visit any remote region of the earth. Under
every disadvantage, however, the active spirit
of commerce exerted itself. The Egyptians, Nv,:,,n
soon after the establishment of their monarchy, ando o.-
are said to have opened a trade between the the tEypti.
Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the western
coast of the great Indian continent. The com-
modities which they imported from the east,
were carried by land from the Arabian Gulph
to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down
that river to the Mediterranean. But if the
Egyptians in early times applied themselves to
commerce, their attention to it was of short
duration. The fertile foil and mild climate of
Egypt produced the necessaries and comforts of
life with such profusion, as rendered its inha-
bitants so independent of other countries, that
it became an eftablifihed maxim among that
people, whose ideas and institutions differed in

Boor I. almost every point from those of other nations,

to renounce all intercourse with foreigners. In
consequence of this, they never went out of
their own country; they held all sea-faring
persons in detestation, as impious and profane;
and fortifying their own harbours, they denied
strangers admittance into them b; and it was in
the decline of their power, that they again
opened their ports, and resumed any commu-
nication with foreigners.

C ,.: THE character and situation of the Phenici-
Pb_.c...s. ans were as favourable to the spirit of commerce

and discovery as those of the Egyptians were
adverse to it. They had no distinguishing pe-
culiarirv in their manners and institutions; they
were not addiaced to any singular and unsocial
form of superstition; they could mingle with
ohecr nations without scruple or reluctance.
The territory which they possessed was neither
large nor fertile. Commerce was the only
source from which they could derive opulence
or power. Accordingly, the trade carried on
by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tvre, was more
extensive and enterprising than that of any state
in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe-

nicians,

nicians, as well as the obje& of their policy and BooK I.
the spirit of their laws, were entirely commer-
cial. They were a people of merchants who
aimed at the empire of the sea, and actually
possessed it. Their ships not only frequented
all the ports in the Mediterranean, but they
were the first who ventured beyond the ancient
boundaries of navigation, and passing the
Streights of Gades, visited the western coasts of
Spain and Africa. In many 6f the places to
which they retorted, they planted colonies, and
communicated to the rude inhabitants some
knowledge of their arts and improvements.
While they extended their discoveries towards
the north and the weft, they did not negle&t to
penetrate into the more opulent and fertile re-
gions of the south and east. Having rendered
themselves matters of several commodious har-
bours towards the bottom of the Arabian
Gulph, they, after the example of the Egypti-
ans, eftabliffied a regular intercourse with Ara-
bia and the continent of India on the one hand,
and with the eastern coast of Africa on the
other. From there countries they imported
many valuable commodities, unknown to the
reft of the world, and, during a long period,
engrossed that lucrative branch of commerce
without a rival '.

THE

Boor; I. THE vafl wealth which the Phenicians ac-
0 cie. quired by monopolizing the trade carried on

in the Red Sea, incited their neighbours the
Jews, under the prosperous reigns of David
and Solomon, to aim at being admitted to
some hfare of it. This they obtained, partly
by their conquest of Idumea, which stretches
along the Red Sea, and partly by their alli-
ance with Hiram king of Tyre. Solomon
fitted out fleets, which, under the direction of
Phenician pilots, failed from the Red Sea to
Tarlhiifh and Ophir. These it is probable
were ports in India and Africa which their
conductors were accustomed to frequent, and
from them the Jewish ships returned with such
valuable cargoes as suddenly diffused wealth
and splendour through the kingdom of Israel d.
But the singular institutions of the Jews, the
observance of which was enjoined by their
divine legislator, with an intention of preferv-
ing them a separate people, uninfected by ido-
latry, fonned a national chara&er incapable of
that open and liberal intercourse with strangers
which commerce requires. Accordingly, this
unsocial genius of the people, together with
the disasters which besel the kingdom of Israel,

prevented

prevented the commercial spirit which their RooK I.
monarchs laboured to introduce, and to cherish,
from spreading among them. The Jews can-
not be numbered among the nations which
contributed to improve navigation, or to ex-
tend discovery.

BuTr though the inftru&ions and example of Of the Ca-

tbagwiaas.

the Phenicians were unable to mould the man-
ners and temper of the Jews, in opposition to
the tendency of their laws, they transmitted
the commercial spirit with facility, and in full
vigour, to their own descendants the Cartha-
ginians. The commonw.ealth of Carthage ap-
plied to trade and to naval affairs, with no less
ardour, ingenuity, and success, than its parent
ifate. Carthage early rivalled, and soon fur-
passed Tyre, in opulence and power, but seems
not to have aimed at obtaining any.fhare in
the commerce with India. The Phenicians
had engrossed this, and had such a command
of the Red Sea as fccured to them the exclu-
five possession of that lucrative branch of trade.
The commercial at&ivity of the Carthaginians
was exerted in another direction. Without
contending for the trade of the east with their
mother-country, they extended their naviga-
tion chiefly towards the weft and north. Fol-
lowing the course which the Phenicians had

opened,

BooK I. opened, they passed the Streights of Gades,

* and punfling their discoveries far beyond those

of the parent state, visited not only all the
coasts of Spain, but those of Gaul, and pene-
trated at last into Britain. At the fame time
that they acquired knowledge of new countries
in this part of the globe, they gradually car-
ried their researches towards the South. They
made considerable progress, byjland, into the
interior provinces of Africa, traded with some
of them, and subjected others to their empire.
They failed along the western coast of that
grear continent, almost to the tropic of Cancer,
and planted several colonies, in order to civi-
lize the natives, and accustom them to com-
merce. They discovered the Fortunate Illands,
nsw known by the name of the Canaries, the
utmost boundary of ancient navigation in the
western ocean .

NOR was the progress of the Phenicians and

Carthaginians in their knowledge of the globe,
owing entirely to the desire of extending their
trade from one country to another. Com-
merce was followed by its usual effects among
both these people. It awakened curiosity, en-

larged the ideas and desires of men, and incited Boor I.
them to bold enterprises. Voyages were un-
dertaken, the sole obje& of which was to dif-
cover new countries, and to explore unknown
seas. Such, during the prosperous age of the
Carthaginian republic, were the famous navi-
gations of Hanno and Himilco. Both their
fleets were equipped by authority of the senate,
and at public expence. Hanno was directed
to steer towards the south, along the coast of
Africa, and he seems to have advanced much
nearer the equinoctial line than any former
navigator'. Himilco had it in charge to pro-
ceed towards the north, and to examine the
western coasts of the European continent . Of
the fame nature was the extraordinary naviga-
tion of the Phenicians round Africa. A Phe-
nician fleet, we are told, fitted out by Necho
king of Egypt, took its departure about fix
hundred and four years before the Christian
BTra, from a port in the Red Sea, doubled the
southern promontory of Africa, and after a
voyage of three years, returned by the Streights

THESE voyages, if performed in the manner

which I have related, may justly be reckoned
the greatest effort of navigation in the ancient
world; and if we attend to the imperfct state
of the art at that time, it is difficult to deter-
mine, whether we fihould mods admire the
courage and sagacity with which the design
was formed, or the conduct and good fortune
with which it was executed. But unfortunately,
all the original and authentic accounts of the
Phenician and Carthaginian voyages, whether
undertaken by public authority, or in prose-
cution of their private trade, have perished.
The information which we receive concerning
them fromn the Greek and Roman authors, is
not only obscure and inaccurate, but, if we
except a short narrative of Hanno's expedition,
is of suspicious authority k. Whatever ac,

quired, was concealed from the reft of mankind Boor I.
with a mercantile jealousy. Every thing rela-
tive to the course of their navigation was not
only a mystery of trade, but a secret of state.
Extraordinary facts are recorded concerning
their solicitude to prevent other nations from
penetrating into what they wifined should re-
main undivulged'. Many of their discoveries
seem, accordingly, to have been scarcely
known beyond the precincfs of their own states.
The navigation round Africa, in particular, is
recorded by the Greek and Roman writers,
rather as a strange amuling tale, which they
either did not comprehend, or did not believe,
than as a real tranfaslion, which enlarged their
knowledge and influenced their opinion m. As
neither the progress of the Phenician and Car-
thaginian discoveries, nor the extent of their
navigation, were communicated to the reft of
mankind, all memorials of their extraordinary
skill in naval affairs seem, in a great measure,
to have perished, when the maritime power of
the former was annihilated by Alexander's con-

Of ib- accounts of the Phenician and Carthaginian

riquaries, history must reft satisfied with relat-
ing the progress of navigation and discovery
among the Greeks and Romans, which, though
less splendid, is better ascertained. It is evi-
dent that the Phenicians, who inftrusted the
Greeks in other useful sciences and arts, did
no: communicate to them that extensive know-
ledge of navigation which they themselves
poffeiTed; nor did the Romans imbibe that
commercial fpirir and ardour for discovery
which distinguished the Carthaginians. Though

which formed many spacious bays and commo-
dious harbours, though it be surrounded by a
vi; r.nmber of fertile illands, yet, notwith-
.ianding ;luch a favourable situation, which
c':r~ed to invite that ingenious people to apply
'th.mfcives to navigation, it was long before
thnis art attained any degree of perfection among
them. Their early voyages, the objec of
v;'ic.h was piracy rather than commerce, were
so incaofiderable, that the expedition of the
Argonauts from the coast of Thessaly to the
Euxiore lea, appeared I'ch an amazing effort
of lkill and couraie, as entitled the conductors

at a later period, when the Greeks engaged in
their famous enterprize against Troy, their
knowledge in naval affairs seems not to have
been much improved. According to the ac-
count of Homer, the only poet to whom history
ventures to appeal, and who, by his scrupulous
accuracy in describing the manners and arts
of early ages, merits this diftincion, the
science of navigation, at that time, had hardly
advanced beyond its rudest slate. The Greeks
in the heroic age were unacquainted with the
use of iron, the most serviceable of all the
metals, without which no considerable progress
was ever made in the mechanical arts. Their
vessels were of inconsiderable burthen, and
mofily without decks. These had only one
mafl, which they erected or took down at
plcalfue. They were strangers to the use of
anchors. All their operations in failing were
clumsy and unskilful. They turned their ob-
servation towards flars, which were improper
for regulating their course, and their mode of
observing them was inaccurate and fallacious.
When they had finiflhed a voyage they drew
their paltry barks ashore, as savages do their
canoes, and these remained on dry land until
ilie fealon of returning to sea approached. It

with impetuous valour, but little art, to board
those of the enemy. In the war of Pelo-
ponnefus, their ships seem frill to have been
of inconsiderable burthen and force. The ex-
tent of their trade was in proportion to this
low condition of their marine. The maritime
frates of Greece hardly carried on any com-
-nerce beyond the limits of the Mediterranean
sea. Their chief intercourse was with the
colonies of their countrymen, planted in the
lcller Asia, in Italy and Sicily. They some-
times visited the ports of Egypt, of Gaul, and
of Thrace, or passing through the Hlellcfpont,
they traded with the countries situated around
the Euxine sea. Amazing instances occur of
their ignorance, even of those countries, which
lay within the narrow precincts to which their
navigation was confined. When the Greeks
had afTimbled their combined fleet against
Xerxes at Egina, they thought it unadvifable
to fail to Samnos, because they believed the
distance between that island and Egina to be
as great as the distance between Egina and the
Pillars of Hercules °. They were either utterly

fciencc had prompted to travel by land into

cient icats of wisdom and arts. After all that
the Greeks learned from them, they appear to
have been ignorant of the mofR important faas,
on which. an accurate and Icientific knowledge
cf t':e globe is founded.

THE expedition of Alexander the Great into

.-.z ealt, ccnfiderably enlarged the fphcre of
navigation and of geographical knowledge
among the Greeks. That extraordinary man,
notwithifanding the violent pafilons which in-
c:ted him, at some times, to the wildest actions,
n.d the mos extravagant enterprises, poffefled
talct..s which fitted him not only to conquer,
lb:: :o govern the world. He was capable of
f'rz:ri.n th'ose bold and original schemes of
po.'\', w',;ch give a new form to human
::--:.--. The revolution in commerce, brought
aboLt bv the force of his genius, is hardly in-
ferio- .o that revolution in empire, occasioned
b-. t'-.c ficceis of his arms. It is probable,
t'..: tne op?;o:'.un an. ef..r:s of the republic

of

of Tyre, which checked him so long in the BooK I.
career of his victories, gave Alexander an op-
portunity of observing the vast resources of a
maritime power, and conveyed to him some
idea of the immense wealth which the Tyrians
derived from their commerce, especially that
with the East Indies. As soon as he had ac-
compliflhed the deftru&ion of Tyre, and re-
duced Egypt to subjection, he formed the plan
oft rendering the empire which he purposed to
eftablill, the centre of commerce as well as
the feat of dominion. With this view he
founded a great city, which he honoured with
his own name, near one of the mouths of the
river Nile, that by the Mediterranean sea, and
the neighbourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it
mi>ght command the trade both of the east and
well '. This situation was chosen with such
discernment, that Alexandria loon became the
chief commercial city in the world. Not only
during the subsistence of the Grecian empire
in Egypt and in the east, but amidif all the

His amb;ition was not satisfied with having

oper,-d to the Greeks a communication with
India by lea; he aspired to the sovereignty of
thoie regions which furnished the reft of man-
kind with ib many precious commodities, and
condujcd his army thither by land. Enter-
prniing, however, as he was, he may be laid
rather to have dilcovered, than to have con-
querJl that country. He did not, in his pro-
geis townards the calt, advance beyond the
ban'ks of the rivers that fall into the Indus,
w.inich ji now the weitern boundary of the vast
co-:;ncnt of India. Amidift the wild exploits
which dii.inauith this part of his hisory, he
purf',ied measures that mark the superiority
of his 2enius, as wvil as the extent of his
views. He had penetrated as far into India

propol;cd to remove the cataracts, with which,
the jcaloul' of the Persians, and their aversion

THE progress which the Romans made in BooK I.

navigation and discovery, was still more in- Or the R-
considerable than that of the Greeks. The ma.s.
genius of the Roman people, their military
education, and the spirit of their laws, con-
curred in estranging them from commerce and
naval affairs. It was the necessity of opposing
a formidable rival, not the desire of extending
trade, which first prompted them to aim at
maritime power. Though they soon perceived
that, in order to acquire the universal domi-
nion after which they aspired, it was necessary
to render themselves masters of the lea, they
still confidered the naval service as a fubordi-
nate station, and reserved for it such citizens
as were not of a rank to be admitted into the
legions I. In the history of the Roman re-
public, hardly one event occurs, that marks
attention to navigation any farther than as it
was instrumental towards conquest. When the
Roman valour and discipline had subdued all
the maritime states known in the ancient
world ; when Carthage, Greece, and Egypt,
had fSubmitted to their power, the Romans
did not imbibe the commercial spirit of the
conquered nations. Among that people of
ifldicir, to have applied to trade would have

Boo.: r. been deemed a degradation of a Roman citizen.
'^~' They abandoned the mechanical arts, com-

merce, and navigation, to slaves, to freedmen,
to provincials, and to citizens of the lowest
clais. Even after the subversion of liberty,
when the severity and haughtiness of ancient
manners began to abate, commerce did not rile
i;:to high eflimation among the Romans. The
rade of Greece, Egypt, and the other con-
qercd, countries, continued to be carried on in
its usual channels, after they were reduced into
the form of Roman provinces. As Rome was
the capital of the world, and the feat of govern-
ment, all the wealth and valuable productions
o-. the provinces filuwcd naturally thither. The
Romans, iatisfied with this, seem to have sus-
f..-ed conmmerce to remain aimoft entirely in
.i:.e ,.nd of the natives of the reipecrive coun-
t;:-s. The extent, however, of the Roman
power, which reached over the greatest part of

Ronman magiarates, and the spirit of the Ro-
nian government, no less intelligent than active,

tradle with India through Egypt was pushed
\with new vigour, and carried on to greater ex-
tent. By frequenting the Indian continent,
navigators became acquainted with the periodi-
cal course of the winds, which, in the ocean
that separates Africa from India, blow with
iEttle variation during one half of the year from
the east, and during the other half fix with
equal steadiness from the weft. Encouraged
by observing this, they abandoned their ancient
flow and dangerous course along the coast, and
as loon as the western monsoon set in, took
their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of
the Arabian Gulf, and stretched boldly across
the ocean v. The uniform direction of the
windi, lupplying the place of the compass, and
rendering the guidance of the stars less ne-

turning with the eastern monsoon, finished their
voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year.
This part of India, now known by the name of
the Malabar coast, seems to have been the ut-
most limit of ancient navigation in that quar-
rer of the globe. What imperfect knowledge
the ancients had of the immense countries which
stretch beyond this towards the eafr, they re-
ceived from a few adventurers, who had vi-
lited them by land. Such excursions were
neither frequent nor extensive, and it is pro-
bable, that while the Roman intercourse with
India subsisted, no traveller ever penetrated
further than to the banks of the Ganges z. The
fleets from Egypt which traded at Mufiris were
loadcd, it is true, with the spices and other
rich commodities of the continent and islands
of the farther India; but these were brought to
that por:, which became the staple of this com-
r,.erce, by the Indians themselves, in canoes
hollowed out of one tree '. The Egyptian and
Roman merchants, satisfied with acquiring those
con...odities in this manner, did not think it
r.cc ar.- to explore unknown seas, and ven-

the countries which produced them. But Book I.
though the discoveries of the Romans in In-
dia were io limited, their commerce there was
such as will appear considerable, even to the
present age, in which the Indian trade has been
extended far beyond the practice or conception
of any preceding period. We are informed by
one author of credit b, that the commerce with
India drained the Roman empire every year of
more than four hundred thousand pounds; and
by another, that one hundred and twenty ships
failed annually from the Arabian Gulf to that
country '.

THE discovery of this new method of failing Dircoveri

to India, is the most considerable improvement cient, by
in navigation made during the continuance of hJ'
the Roman power. But in ancient times, the
knowledge of countries was acquired more by
land than by feal; and the Romans, from their
peculiar disinclination to naval affairs, may be
said to h.we negleced totally the latter, though
a more eaty and expeditious method of dif-
covery. The progress, however, of their vic-
torious armies contributed greatly to extend

- the Roman conquests, the civilized nations of

antiquity had no communication with those
countries in Europe, which now form its most
opulent and powerful kingdoms. The inte-
rior parts of Spain and Gaul were little known.
Britain, separated from the reft of the world,
had never been vifired, except by its neigh-
bours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian
merchants. The name of Germany had scarcely
been heard of. Into all these countries the
arms of the Romans penetrated. They en-
trel- subdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered
the greatest and most fertile part of Britain;
t,,ev advanced into Germany, as far as the
banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they ac-
rt:ired a considerable knowledge of the pro-
vinces, which stretch along the Mediterranean
lea, from Egypt westward to the straits of
Gades. In Asia, they not only fubjeced to
their power most of the provinces which com-
poied the Persian and Macedonian empires,
but, aisrer their victories over Mithridates and
lT ranes, they seem to have made a more ac-
cu.-a:.r 1urvey of the countries contiguous to the
EAxinec and Calpian seas, and to have carried
on a i-o'er cxtenfive trade than that of the
Grecks with the opulent and commercial na-

It fiems neither adequate to what we might
have expected from the activity and enterprise
of the human mind, nor to what might have
been performed by the power of the great em-
pires which successively governed the world. If
wve reject accounts that are fabulous and ob-
[cure; if we adhere steadily to the light and
information of authentic history, without sub-
flituting in its place the conje&tures of fancy,
or the dreams of etymologists, we must con-
elude, that the knowledge which the ancients
had acquired of the habitable globe was ex-
tremely confined. In Europe, the extensive
provinces in the eastern part of Germany were
little known to them. They were almtoft to-
tally unacquainted with the vast countries which
are now subject to the kings of Denmark, Swe-
den, Prussia, Poland, and the Ruffian empire.
The more barren regions, that ?Wretch within
the al(raic circle, were quite unexplored. In
Africa, their researches did not cxrcnd far be-
vond the provinces which border on the Medi-
terrainean, and thole litittted on the weflern
florc of the A:'bian Gulf. In Asia, they were

unac-

Boos I. unacquainted, as I formerly observed, with all

"^' the fertile and opulent countries beyond the

Ganges, which furnish the most valuable com-
modities that, in modern times, have been the
great object of the European commerce with
India; nor do they seem to have ever pene-
trated into those immense regions occupied by
the wandering tribes, which they called by the
general name of Sarmatians or Scythians, and
now poi'effed by Tartars of various denomina-
tion-, and by the Asiatic subjects of Russia.

A r.-.:.- BUT there is one opinion, that universally
S; W:,. prevailed among the ancients, which conveys a

r.lore striking idea of the finall progress they
had made in the knowledge of the habitable
globe, than can be derived from any detail of
their discoveries. They supposed the earth to
be divided into five regions, which they di-
ftingtilifhed by the name of zones. Two of
th-ie, which were nearest the Poles, they termed
frigid zones, and believed that the extreme
cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered
them uninhabitable. Another, feared under
the- line, and extending on either fide towards
the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and
imagined it to be so burnt up with unremitting
heat, as to bc equally destitute of inhabitants.
On the two olther zones, which occupied the

remainder

reimainder of the earth, they bestowed the ap- Book I.
pellation of temperate, and taught that these, --
being the only regions in which life could sub-
silt, were allotted to man for his habitation.
This wild opinion was not a conceit of the un-
infornmed vulgar, or a fanciful fi&ion of the
poets, but a system adopted by the mopc en-
lijhtened philotophers, the most accurate hifto-
rians and geographers in Greece and Rome.
Accoiding to this theory, a vast portion of the
habitakic earth was pronounced to be unfit for
fullaining the human species. Those fertile
and populous regions within the torrid zone,
which are now known not only to yield their
own inhabitants the necessaries and comforts of
life, with most luxuriant profusion, but to
communicate their superfluous stores to the reft
of the world, were supposed to be the mansion
of perpetual sterility and desolation. As all the
parts of the globe, which the ancients had dif-
coveted, lay within the northern tenmperate
zone, their opinion that the other temperate
zone was filled with inhabitants, was founded
on reaioning and conj)cture, not on discovery.
They evecn believed that, by the intolerable
heat of the torrid zone, such an insuperable
barr-'r w as placed between the two temperate
r ' ";ins of the earth, as would prevent for ever
any intercourle between their refpeftive inha-

VOL. I. D bitants,

proves that the ancients were unacquainted with
the true state of the globe, but it tended to
render their ignorance perpetual, by represent-
ing all attempts towards opening a communi-
cation with the remote regions of the earth, as
utterly impracticable f.

BL-T, however imperfect or inaccurate the

geographical knowledge which the Greeks and
Romans had acquired may appear, in refpeat
of the present improved tiate of that science,
their progress in discovery will seem confider-
able, and the extent to which they carried na-
vigation and commerce muir be reckoned great,
when compared with the ignorance of early
thimes. As long as the Roman empire retained
such vigour as to preserve its authority over the
conquered nations, and to keep them united,
it was an object of public police, as well as cf
private curiosity, to examine and describe the
countries which composed this great body.
Even when the other fcierces began to decline,
geography, enriched with new observations,
and receiving some accession from the expe-
rience of every age, arid the reports of every
traveller, continued to imp.ove. It attained

fabric of the Roman power, began to assemble
and to muster their armies on its frontier; the
empire tottered to its fall. During this decline
and old age of the Roman state, it was impof-
fible that the sciences should go on improving.
The efforts of genius were, at that period, as
languid and feeble as those of government.
From the time of Ptolemy, no considerable ad-
dition seems to have been made to geographical
knowledge, nor did any important revolution
happen in trade, excepting that Constantinople,
by its advantageous Situation, and the encou-
ragement of the eastern emperors, became a
commercial city of the first note.

Culltoms every-where prevailed, and even laws
were established, which rendered it disagreeable
and dangerous to visit any foreign country h.
Cities, in which alone an extensive commerce
can be carried on, were few, inconsiderable,
and destitute of those immunities which produce
lecurity or excite enterprise. The sciences, on
which geography and navigation are founded,
were not cultivated. The accounts of ancient
improvements and discoveries, contained in the
Grcek and Roman authors, were neglected or
misunderstood. The knowledge of remote re-
gions was loft, their situation, their contmo

luxuries of foreign countries were in request;
and commerce continued to flourish there, when
it was almost extinct in every other part of Eu-
rope. The citizens of Constantinople did not
confine their trade to the islands of the Archi-
pelago, or to the adjacent coasts of Aria; they
took a wider range, and following the course
which the ancients had marked out, imported
the commodities of the East Indies from Alex-
andria. When Egypt was torn from the Ro-
man empire by the Arabians, the indufrry of
the Greeks discovercd a new channel, by which
the productions of India might be conveyed to
Conmlantinop]e. They were carried up the
Indus, as far as that great river is navigable;
thence they were transported by land to the
banks of the river Oxus, and proceeded down
its Itream to the Caspian sea. There they en-
tered the Volga, and failing up it, were carried
by land to the Tanais, which condluded them
into the Euxine sea, where vessels from Con-
ftantinopie waited their arrival'. This extra-
orc:inarv and tedious mode of convevance merits
attention, not only as a proof of the violent
p.fislon which the inhabitants of Constantinople
had conceived for the luxuries of the eafr, and

which they carried on commerce; but because
it demonstrates, that, during the ignorance
which reigued in the reft of Europe, an exten-
five knowledge of remote countries was still
preserved in the capital of the Greek empire.

AT the fame time, a gleam of light and and among

- 0 ° the Arabi-

knowledge broke in upon the east. The Ara- ans.
bians having contracted some relilh for the
sciences of the people whose empire they had
contributed to overturn, translated the books
of fcveral of the Greek philosophers into their
own language. One of the first was that va-
luable work of Ptolemy, which I have already
mentioned. The study of geography became,
of consequence, an early object of attention to
the Arabians. But that acute and ingenious
people cultivated chiefly the Speculative and
scientific parts of geography. In order to as-
certain the figure and dimensions of the ter-
reftrial globe, they applied the principles of
geometry, they had recourse to aitronomical
observations, they employed experiments and
operations, which Europe, in more enlightened
times, has been proud to adopt and to imitate.
At that period, however, the fame of the im-
provements made by the Arabians did not reach
htu1rope. The knowledge of their discoveries

Witl great advantage. They were supplied '-
both with the precious commodities of the east,
and with many curious manufa&cures, the pro-
du&t of ancient arts and ingenuity which frill
tubfilted among the Greeks. As the labour and
expence of conveying the productions of India
co Constantinople by that long and indirect
c(nlri: which I have described, rendered them
extremely rare, and of an exorbitant price, the
indutiry of the Italians discovered other me-
thods of procuring them in greater abundance,
and at an easier rate. They Iometimes pur-
cha!ed them in Aleppo, Tripoli, and other
p;r's on the coast of Syria, to which they were
irou,-l't by a route not unknown to the ancients.
T'heyV were conveyed from India by sea, up the
'criian Gulf, and alcending the Euphrates and
Tizris, as far as Bagldat, were carried by land
acro:; the Desert to Palmyra, and from thence
to the towns on the Mediterranean. But fi-om
the length of the journey, and the dangers to
whiLh tthe caravans were cxpofed, this proved
ahva.s a tedious, and often a precarious mode
ot conveyance. At length, the Soldans of
Igsyr, having renewed the commerce with In-
alia in its ancient channel, by the Arabian Gulf,
the I:. lian merchants, notwithlranding the vio-
!: t antipathy to each other with which Chri-

BooK r. ftians and the followers of Mahomet were then

pofefleed, repaired to Alexandria, and enduring,
from the love of gain, the insolence and exac-
tions of the Mahometans, eftabiifhed a lucrative
trade in that port. From that period, the com-
mercial spirit of Italy became active and enter-
prifing. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose from in-
considerable towns, to be populous and wealthy
cities. Their naval power increased; their
vessels frequented not only all the ports in the
Mediterranean, but venturing sometimes beyond
the Streights, visited the maritime towns of
Spain, France, the Low Countries, and Eng-
land; and, by diftriburing their commodities
over Europe, began to communicate to its
various nations some taste for the valuable pro-
dutcions of the east, as well as some ideas of
manufactures and arts, which were then un-
known beyond the precinEts of Italy.

-: ,. - \\:ITLz the cities of I-aly were thus advancing
:.'. '

' in their career of :npr.vement, an event hap-
',..-'. - pened, the most cx:raordinary perhaps in the

i.ilory of mankind, which, instead of retarding
the commercial progress of the Italians, ren-
deced it more rapid. The mar:;.i spirit of the
Eu.ropeans, heightened and inilamed by reli-
gious zeal, prompted them to dei.ver the Holy
Land from the dominion of infidels. Vast ar-

mies,

marched towards Asia, upon this wild enter-
prise. The Genoese, the Pifans, and Vene-
tians furnished the transports which carried them
thither. They supplied them with provisions
and military stores. Beside the immense fums
which they received on this account, they ob-
tained commercial privileges and establish-
ments, of great consequence in the settlements
which the Crusaders made in Palestine, and in
other provinces of Asia. From those sources,
prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I
have mentioned. This was accompanied with
a proportional increase of power, and by the
end of the Holy War, Venice, in particular,
became a great maritime state, poffefling an ex-
tensive commerce, and ample territories 1. Italy
was not the only country in which the Crusades
contributed to revive and diffuse such a spirit as
prepared Europe for future discoveries. By
their expeditions into Asia, the other European
nations became well acquainted with remote
regions, which formerly they knew only by
name, or by the reports of ignorant and credu-
lous pilgrims. They had an opportunity of
observing the manners, the arts, and the ac-

They were afterwards undertakenfrom prospeCts Boor I.
of commercial advantage, or from motives of '
mere curiosity. Benjamin, a Jew of Tudela,
in the kingdom of Navarre, pofieffed with a
tlperllitious veneration for the law of Moses,
and solicitous to visit his countrymen in the east,
whom he hoped to find in such a state of power
and opulence as might redound to the honour
of his felC, set out from Spain in the year I I6o,
and travelling by land ro Constantinople, pro-
ceeded through the countries to the north of
the F.uxine and Caspian seas, as far as Chinese
Tartary. From thence he took his route to-
wards the south, and after traversing various
provinces of the farther India, he embarked on
the Indian ocean, visited several of its islands,
:and returned at the end of thirteen years, by
the way of Egypt, to Europe, with much in-
fo:-iation concerning a large diftri& of the

Carpini, at the head of a milTion of Franciscan
monks, and father Afcolino, at the head of
another of Dominicans, to exhort Kayuk Khan,
the grandson of Zengis, who was then at the
head of the Tartar empire, to embrace the
Chr:fti- n faith, and to desist from desolating the
earth bv his arms. The haughty descendant of
the Createrft conqueror Asia had ever beheld,
afloniflied at this strange mandate from an Ita-
lian pricl, whose name and jurisdiction were
alike unknown to him, received it with the
contempt which it merited, though he dismissed
the mendicants who delivered it with impunity.
But as they had penetrated into the country by
different routes, and followed for some time the
Tartar camps, which were always in motion,
they had an opportunity of visiting a great part
of Asia. Carpini, who proceeded by the way
of Poland and Russia, travelled through its
northern provinces as far as the extremities of
Thibet. Afcolino, who seems to have landed
somewhere in Syria, advanced through its
southern provinces, into the interior parts of
Persia °.

buted farther towards extending the knowledge ,3
which the Europeans had begun to acquire of
those distant regions. Some designing im-
poftor, who took advantage of the fiender ac-
quaintance of Christendom with the slate and

formed him that a powerful Chan of the Tar-
tars had embraced the Chriffian faith, the
monarch listened to the tale with pious credu-
lity, and instantly resolved to fend ambassadors
to this illustrious con .ert, with a view of in-
citing him to attack their common enemy the
Saracens in one quarter, while he fell upon
them in another. As monks were the only
persons in that age who possessed such a degree
of knowledge as qualified them for a service of
this kind, he employed in it father Andrew, a
Jacobine, who was followed by father William
de Rubruquis, a Franciscan. With refped& to
the progress of the former, there is no memo-
rial extant. The journal of the latter has been
publilhed. He was admitted into the presence
of Mangu, the third khan in fucceflion from
Zengis, and made a circuit through the inte-
rior parts of Asia, more extensive than that of
any European who had hitherto explored theme,

-':-* forth to vifi; Aia, fucccded others who vcn-

t::'cd ir.to remote contries, froill the prospect
of co:mn.-rcial advant.ge, or from motives of
mn--e cuiioflrv. The first ind mofic eminent of
the;!s was Marco Polo, a Venetian of a noble
;5S9. ._'. :nl,.. Having engaged early in trade, ac-

cord:ng to the cuftomr of his country, his afpir-
irng mind wished for a sphere of activity more
ext,.nfive than was afborded to it by the efla-
bli'i;ed traffic carried on in those ports of
Europe and Asia, which the Venetians fre-
quented. This prompted him to travel into
unknuwn countries, in expectation of opening
xwi:h them a commercial intercourse, more
suited to the fanguinc ideas and hopes of a
young adventurer.

As his faLher had already carried some

European commodities to the court of the
great Chan of the Tartars, and had disposed
of them to advantage, he resorted thither.
Under the prote.tion of Kublay Chan, the
most powerful of all the fucccllbrs of Zengis,
he continued his mercantile peregrinations in
Asia upwards of twenty-fix years; and during
that time advanced.towards the east, far be-
vond the u:bmoi t boundaries to which any
European tr.ve!!er had ever proceeded. In-

stead

flead of following the course of Carpini and BooK I.
Rubruquis, along the vast unpeopled plains
of Tartary, he passed through the chief trad-
ing cities in the more cultivated parts of Asia3
and penetrated to Cambalu, or Peking, the
capital of the great kingdom of Cathay, or
China, fubje& at that time to the successors of
Zengis. He made more than one voyage on
the Indian ocean, he traded in many of the
islands, from which Europe had long received
fpiceries and other commodities, which it held
in high estimation, though unacquainted with
the particular countries to which it was in-
debted for those precious productions; and he
obtained information concerning several coun-
tries, which he did not visit in person, parti-
cularly the island Zipangri, probably the fame
now known by the name of Japan P. On his
return, he astonished his contemporaries with
his delcriptions of vast regions, whose names
had never been heard of in Europe, and with
such pompous accounts of their fertility, their
populousness, their opulence, the variety oP
their manufactures, and the extent of their
trade, as rose far above the conception of an
uninformed age.

Booz rI. ABOUT half a century after Marco Polo, Sir

;',, John Mandeville, an Enllilhman, encouraged

by his example, visited most of the countries
in the east which he had described, and, like
him, published an account of them q. The
narrations of those earlv travellers abound with
many wild incoherent tales, concerning giants,
enchanters, and monsters. But they were not,
from that circumiftance, less acceptable to an
ignorant age, which delighted in what was

av.i-.llous. The wonders which they told,
mofily on hearsay, filled the multitude with
admiration. The faSts which they related from
their own observation, attracted the attention
oi: he more discerning. The former, which
may be confidered as the popular traditions
and fables of the countries through which they
had pafled, were gradually disregarded as
Eiuroie advanced in knowledge. The latter,
however incredible tome of them may have
ap-eared in their own time, have been con-
firned bv the observations of modern travellers.
Bv means of both, however, the curiosity of
lymankind was excited with respect to the re-
n-ote parts of the earth, their ideas were en-

such information as directed to that particu- BOOK I.
lar course in which these were afterwards car- -"
ried on.

WHILE this spirit was gradually forming in andbythe

Europe, a fortunate discovery was made, which th...,rin.rs
contributed more than all the efforts and inge- comPat.
nuity of preceding ages, to improve and to
extend navigation. That wonderful property
of the magnet, by which it communicates such
virtue to a needle or slender rod of iron, as to
point towards the poles of the earth, was ob-
servcd. The use which might be made of this
in directing navigation was immediately per-
ceived. That most valuable, but now familiar
instrument, the mariners compass, was formed.
When, by means of it, navigators found that
at all seasons, and in every place, they could
discover the north and south with so much cafe
and accuracy, it became no longer necessary
to depend merely on the light of the flars and
the obfcrvation of the sea coast. They gra-
du. lly abandoned rheir ancient timid and lin-
recring course along the shore, ventured boldly
into the ocean, and relying on this new guide,
could fleer in the darkest night, and under the
moti cloudy ficy, with a 1ecurity and precision
hitherto unknown. The compass may be laid
to have opened to man the dominion of the

E 2 sea,

BooK I. f a, and to have put him in full possession of
-"' - the earth, by enabling him to visit every part

of it. Flavio Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, a
town of con/iderable trade in the kingdom of
Naples, was the author of this great discovery,
about the year one thousand three hundred
and two. It hath been often the fate of those
iiijflrious benefactors of mankind, who have
enriched fiience and improved the arts by their
inventions, to derive more reputation than
benefit from the happy efforts of their genius.
But the lot of Gioia has been fsill more cruel;
through the inattention or ignorance of con-
temporary historians, he has been defrauded even
of the fame to which he had such a just title.
We receive from them no information with
respect to his profession, his character, the
preciie time when he made this important dif-
covery, or the accidents and inquiries which
led to it. The knowledge of this event,
though produc-tive of greater effects than any
recorded in the annals of the human race, is
transmitted to us without any of those circum-
stances, which can gratify the curiosity that it
naturally awakens,. But though the use of
the conpafs might enable the Italians to per-
form the fhor: voyages to which they were

accu f-

accuffomed, with greater security and expedi- BooK I.
tion, its influence was not so sudden or extensive,
as immediately to render navigation adventu-
rous, and to excite a spirit of discovery. Many
causes combined in preventing this beneficial
invention from producing its full effect inftan-
taneoufly. Men relinquish ancient habits
slowly, and with reluctance. They are averse
to new experiments, and venture upon them
with timidity. The commercial jealousy of
the Italians, it is probable, laboured to con-
ceal the happy discovery of their countryman
from other nations. The art of fleering by
the compass, with such skill and accuracy as
to inspire a full confidence in its direction, was
acquired gradually. Sailors, unaccuftoned to
quit fight of land, durst not launch out at once
and commit themselves to unknown seas. Ac-
cordingly, near half a century elapsed, from
the time of Gioia's discovery, before navigators
ventured into any seas which they had not been
accustomed to frequent.

THE first appearance of a bolder spirit may Some ap-

be dated from the voyages of the Spaniards to a b;d''r
the Canary or Fortunate Islands. By what r....ion.
accident they were led to the discovery of those
fmrall isles, which lie near five hundred miles
from the Spanish coast, and above a hundred

E 3 and

Boot I. and fifty miles from the coast of Africa, con-

temporary writers have not explained. But about
the middle of t'ie fourteenth century, the people
of all the ditiirent kiingdoms into which Spain
was then divided, were accufRomed to make
piratical excursions thither, in order to plunder
the inhabitants, or to carry them off as slaves.
Clement VI. in virtue of the right claimed by
the holy ife to dispose of all countries polfeffed
by infidels, erected those isles into a kingdom,
in the year one thousand three hundred and
fortv-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la
Cerda, descended from the royal family of
Castile. But that unfortunate prince, destitute
of power to assert his nominal title, having
never visited the Canaries, John de Bethen-
court, a Norman baron, obtained a grant of
them from Henry I!I. of Castile,. Bethen-
court, with the valour and good fortune which
distinguished the adventurers of his country,
at:enmpted and cffe-ted the conquest, and the
poeffeion of the Canaries remained for rome
timne in his familv, as a. es held of the crown
of Castile. Previous to this expedition of
Bethencourr, his countrv.men fettled in Nor-
mandy are said to have visited the coast of

Africa,

Africa, and to have proceeded far to the south BooK I.
of the Canary islands. But their voyages thither ~
seem not to have been undertaken in confe-
quence of any public or regular plan for ex-
tending navigation and attempting new disco-
veries. They were either excursions suggested
by that roving piratical spirit, which descended
to the Normans from their ancestors, or the
commercial enterprises of private merchants,
which attracted so little notice, that hardly any
memorial of them is to be found in contempo-
rary authors. In a general firvey of the pro-
grefs of discovery, it is sufficient to have men-
tioned this event; and leaving it among those
of dubious existence, or of small importance,
we may conclude, that though much additional
information concerning the remote regions of
the East had been received by travellers who
visited them by land, navigation, at the begin-
ning of the fifteenth century, had not advanced
beyond the state to which it had attained before
the downfal of the Roman empire.

AT length the period arrived, when Provi- First regul

denee decreed that men were to pass the limits Pof,yf'i-
within which they had been to long confined,
and open to themselves a more ample field
wherein to display their talents, their enter-
prise, and courage. The first considerable

E 4 efforts

BooK I. efforts towards this were not made by any
t"-'-'° of the more powerful fiates of Europe, or by

those who had applied to navigation with the
greatest assiduity and success. The glory of
leading the way in this new career was reserved

... b, for Portugal, one of the smallest and most
l.O'. tiinconfiderable of the European kingdoms. As

the attempts of the Portuguese to acquire the
knowledge of those parts of the globe with
which mankind were then unacquainted, not
only improved and extended the art of naviga-
tion, but routed Such a spirit of curiosity and
enterprise, as led to the discovery of the New
World, of which I propose to write the history,
it is necessary to take a view of the rife, the
progress, and success of their various naval
operations. It was in this school that the dif-
coverer of America was trained; and unless
we trace the steps by which his instructors and
guides advanced, it will be impofrible to com-
prehend the circumstances which suggested the
idea, or facilitated the execution of his great
design.

c;tr.'--_- V\ARIOUS circumnftances prompted the Por-
... ." r' nuluefe to exert their activitv in this new

direl-'on, and enabled them to accomplish
underLakings apparently superior to the natural
force of their monarchy. The kings of Por-

tugal,

tugal, having driven- the Moors out of their BooK 1.
dominions, had acquired power, as well as
glory, by the success of their arms against the
infidels. By their victories over them, they
had extended the royal authority beyond the
narrow limits within which it was originally
circuinfcribed in Portugal, as well as in other
feudal kingdoms. They had the command of
the national force, could rouse it to aft with
united vigour, and, after the expulsion of the
Moors, could employ it without dread of in-
terruption from any domestic enemy. By the
perpetual hoffilities carried on for several cen-
turies against the Mahometans, the martial and
adventurous spirit which distinguished all the
European nations during the middle ages, was
improved and heightened among the Portu-
guefe. A fierce civil war towards the dlofe of
the fourteenth century, occasioned by a dif-
puted fucceflion, augmented the military ar-
dour of the nation, and formed or called forth
men of such active and daring genius, as are
fit for bold undertakings. The situation of
the kingdom, bounded on every fide by the
dominions of a more powerful neighbour, did
not afford free scope to the activity of the
Portuguese by land, as the strength of their
monarchy was no match for that of Castile.
But Portugal was a maritime state, in which

there

Boo, I. there were many commodious harbours; the

~ people had begun to make some progress in

the knowledge and practice of navigation ; and
the sea was open to them, presenting the only
field of enterprise in which they could diftin-
guifh themselves.

vF;r 2:-. SUCH was the slate of Portugal, and such
Kret the disposition of the people, when John I.

surnamed the Balsard, obtained secure posses-
sion of the crown by the peace concluded with
Caflile in the year one thousand four hundred
and eleven. He was a prince of great merit,
who, by superior courage and abilities, had
opened his way to a throne which of right did
nor belong to him. He instantly perceived
that it would be impossible to preserve public
order, or domeflic tranquillity, without find-
ing some employment for the restless spirit of
his fubjccts. With this view, he assembled a
numerous fleet at Lisbon, composed of all the
fihips chat he could fit out in his own kingdom,
and of many hired from foreigners. This
great armament was destined to attack the
14!:. .Moors fettled on the coast of Barbary. While

i: ,..as equipping, a few vessels were appointed
to fail 'lon; the western shore of Africa bounded
by the Atlantic ocean, and to discover the un-
known countries situated there. From this

incon-

inconsiderable attempt, we may date the corn- BooK I.
mencement of that spirit of discovery which -
opened the barriers that had so long ffhut out
mankind from the knowledge of one half of
the terrestrial globe.

AT the time when John sent forth these ships

on this new voyage, the art of navigation was
still very imperfect. Though Africa lay so
near to Portugal, and the fertility of the coun-
tries already known on that continent invited
men to explore it more fully, the Portuguese
had never ventured to fail beyond Cape Non.
That promontory, as its name imports, was
hitherto confidered as a boundary which could
not be passed. But the nations of Europe had
now acquired as much knowledge, as embold-
ened them to disregard the prejudices and to
corre& the errors of their anceflors. The long
reign of ignorance, the constant enemy of every
curious inquiry, and of every new undertak-
ing, was approaching to its period. The light
of science began to dawn. The works of the
ancient Greeks and Romans began to be read
with admiration and profit. The sciences cul-
tivated by the Arabians were introduced into
Europe by the Moors fettled in Spain and
Portugal, and by the Jews, who were very
numerous in both these kingdoms. Geometry,

aftro-

BooK I. astronomy, and geography, the sciences on
~'--r'' which the art of navigation is founded, became

objects of studious attention. The memory
of the discoveries made by the ancients was
revived, and the progress of their navigation
and commerce began to be traced. Some of the
causes which have obftruced the cultivation of
science in Portugal, during this century and the
last, did not exist, or did not operate in the
fame manner, in the fifteenth centuryt; and
the Porruguefe, at that period, seem to have
kept pace with other nations on this fide of the
Alps in literary pursuits.
. As the genius of the age favoured the execu-

tion of that new undertaking, to which the
peculiar itate of their country invited the Por-
tuguefe, it proved successful. The vessels sent
on the discovery doubled that formidable Cape,
which had terminated the progress of former
navigators, and proceeded a hundred and sixty
miles beyond it, to Cape Bojador. As its
rocky cliffs, which Wfretched a considerable
wvav into the Atlantic, appeared more dreadful
than the promontory which they had passed,
the Portuzuefe commanders durit not attempt
to fail round i;, but returned to Lilbon, more

nation, and pushed it on to new undertakings.
In order to render these successful, it was
necessary that they fliould be conducted by a
person who possessed abilities capable of dif-
cerning what was attainable, who enjoyed
leisure to form a regular system for prosecuting
discovery, and who was animated with ardour
that would persevere in spite of obstacles and
repulses. Happily for Portugal, she found all
those qualities in Henry duke of Viseo, the
fourth son of king John by Philippa of Lan-
caster, sifter of Henry IV. king of England.
That prince, in his early youth, having ac-
companied his father in his expedition to Bar-
bary, distinguished himself by many deeds of
valour. To the martial spirit, which was the
characteristic of every man of noble birth at
that time, he added all the accomplishments
of a more enlightened and polished age. He
cultivated the arts and sciences, which were
then unknown and despised by persons of his

3 rank.

Boor I. rank. He applied with peculiar fondness to

the fRudy of geography; and by the infsruclion
of able masters, as well as by the accounts of
travellers, he early acquired such knowledge
of the habitable globe, as discovered the great
probability of finding new and opulent coun-
tries, by lailing along the coast of Africa.
Such an object was formed to awaken the en-
thufiafm and ardour of a youthful mind, and
he engaged with the utmost zeal to patronize
a design which might prove as beneficial, as it
appeared to be splendid and honourable. In
order that he might pursue this great scheme
without interruption, he retired from court im-
mediately after his return from Africa, and
fixed his residence at Sagres, near Cape St.
Vincent, where the profpe& of the Atlantic
ocean invited his thoughts continually towards
his favourite project, and encouraged him to
execute it. In this retreat he was attended
by :brie of the inoft learned men in his country,
who aided him in his researches. He applied
ibr inrormation to the Moors of Barbary, who
v.erie a:ccufiome' to travel by land into the
i..:-rior provinces of Africa, in queit of ivory,
Loi:-du it, and other rich comr-odities. He
con.,:l:d the Jew, fettled in Portugal. By
proin.'cs, rewards, and marks of refpeE, he
allured ito his ifervice Ieveral persons, foreign-

ers

ers as well as PQrtuguefe, who were eminent BOOK I.
for their skill in navigation. In taking those -'
preparatory steps, the great abilities of the
prince were seconded by his private virtues.
His integrity, his affability, his refpeft for
religion, his zeal for the honour of his country,
engaged persons of all ranks to applaud his
design, and to favour the execution of it. His
schemes were allowed by the greater part of
his countrymen to proceed neither from ambi-
tion, nor the desire of wealth, but to flow
from the warm benevolence of a heart eager to
promote the happiness of mankind, and which
justly intitled him to assume a motto for his
device, that described the quality, by which
he wilhed to be distinguished, the talent of
doing good.

His first effort, as is usual at the commence- D;rcoVry of

ment of any new undertaking, was extremely Portosanto''
inconsiderable. He fitted out a tingle ship,
and giving the command of it to John Gon-
zalecz Zarco and Tristan Vaz, two gentlemen
of his household, who voluntarily offered to
conduct the enterprise, he inftru&ted them to
use their utmost efforts to double Cape Boja-
dor, and thence to fleer towards the south.
They, according to the mode of navigation
which still prevailed, held their course along

the

Boor I. the shore; and by following that direction,

'" they mufft have encountered almost insuperable

difficulties in attempting to pass Cape Bojador.
But fortune came in aid to their want of skill,
and prevented the voyage from being alto-
gether fruitless. A sudden squall of wind arose,
drove them out to sea, and when they expeded
every moment to perish, landed them on an
unknown ifiand, which from their happy escape
they named Pcrto Santo. In the infancy of
navigation, the discovery of this small island
appeared a matter of such moment, that they
instantly returned to Portugal with the good
tidings, and were received by Henry with the
applause and honour due to fortunate adven-
turers. This faint dawn of success filled a
mind ardent in the pursuit of a favourite obje&t
with such sanguine hopes as were sufficient in-
1419. citements to proceed. Next year, Henry sent

out three ships under the fame commanders,
to whom he joined Bartholomew Pereftrello,
in order to take possession of the island which
they had discovered. When they began to
fettle in Porto Santo, they observed towards
the south a fixed spot in the horizon, like a
o r-'.~. finall black cloud. By degrees, they were led

to conjecture that it might be land, and steer-
ing towards it, they arrived at a considerable
island, uninhabited and covered with wood,

which

which on that account they called Madeira u; Boo I;
As it was Henry's chief object to render his
dlifcoveries useful to his countrys he imme- tS,4.
diately equipped a fleet to carry a colony of
Portuguese to these islands. By his provident
care, they were furnished not only with the
feeds, plants, and domestic animals common
in Europe; but as he foresaw that the warmth
of the climate and fertility of the foil would
prove favourable to the rearing of other pro-
dutions, he procured flips of the vine from
the island of Cyprus, the rich wines of which
were then in great request, and plants of the
sugar-cane from Sicily, into which it had been
lately introduced, These throve so profpe-
roufly in this new country, that the benefit of
cultivating them was immediately perceived,
and the sugar and wine of Madeira quickly
became considerable articles in the commerce
of Portugal '.

As soon as the advantages derived from this D1oublecpt

first settlement to the weft of the European o
continent began to be felt, the spirit of disco-

more adventurous. By their voyages to Ma-
deira, the Portuguese were gradually accustom-
ed to a bolder navigation, and inrfead of creep-
ing servilely along the coafr, ventured into the
open sea. In consequence of taking this course,
Gilianez, who commanded one of prince Hen-
rv's ships, doubled Cape Bojador, the boundary
of the Porruguefe navigation upwards of twenty
years, and which had hitherto been deemed
14:;. unpafable. This successful voyage, which the

ignorance of the age placed on a level with
the mo(t famous exploits recorded in history,
opened a new sphere to navigation, as it dif-
covered the vast continent of Africa, frill washed
by the Atlantic ocean, and stretching towards
the south. Part of this was soon explored;

A.,I,-T the Portuguelfe advanced within the tropics,
"';;' .. and in the space of a fcw years they discovered

the river Senegal, and all the coast extending
from Cape Blanco to Cape de Verd.
.A : HITHERTO the Portuguese had been guided

:- heir dilcoveries, or encouraged to attempt

th.:, by the light and information which they
r.cei'.'ed from the works of the ancient mathe-
matic:_ai; and geographers. Bur, when they
began to en:cr the torrid zone, the notion
which pr-v.::cl an'ong the ancients, that the

hear,

heat, which reigned perpetually there, was so BooK I.
cxceflive as to render it uninhabitable, deterred
them, for some time, from proceeding. Their
o'wn obferivations, when they first ventured
into this unknown and formidable region,
tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity con-
.'crning the violent operation of the direct rays
o' the fun. As far as the river Senegal, the
Portuguese had found the coalfc of Africa in-
habited by people nearly resembling the Moors
of Barbery. When they advanced to the south
of that river, the human form feermed to put
on a new appearance. They beheld men with
Il ins black as ebony, with short curled hair,
*?at naols, thick lips, and all the peculiar sea-
tures which are now known to diftinguifl the
race of negroes. This surprising alteration
they naturally attributed to the influence of
i;eat, and if they fhlould advance nearer to the
line, they began to dread that its effects would
be fill more violent. Those dangers were
'x!a grated, and many other objections against
attcmpting farther discoveries were proposed
b;y ;ibme of the grandees, who, fiom ignorance,
firom. envy, or from that cold timid prudence
· .vhih rcje ts whatever has the air of novelty
*.'r entcrprilc, had hitherto condemned all prince
[ Tenv's fLhernes. They represented, that it
,.is altogether chimerical to expect any advan-

1 , tage

BooK I. tage from countries situated in that region

which the wisdom and experience of antiquity
had pronounced to be unfit for the habitation
of men; that their forefathers, satisfied with
cultivating the territory which Providence had
allotted them, did not was'te the strength of the
kingdom by fruidefs projects, in quest of new
fcttlements; that Portugal was already ex-
haufted by the expence of attempts to discover
lands which either did not exist, or which
nature destined to remain unknown; and was
drained of men, who might have been em-
ployed in undertakings attended with more
certain success, and productive of greater bene-
fit. But neither their appeal to the authority
of the ancients, nor their reasonings concern-
ing the interest of Portugal, made any im-
prefflon upon the determined philosophic mind
of prince Henry. The discoveries which he
had already made convinced him that the an-
cients had little more than a conjectural know-
ledge of the torrid zone. He was no less satis-
sied that the political arguments of his oppo-
nents with respect to the interell of Portugal
were malevolent and ill-founded. In those
fenrimenrs he was ltrenuouflv Supported by his
brother Pedro, who governed the kingdom as
guardian o; their nephew Alphonio V. who had
43. succeeded to the throne during his minority;

and

and inflead of slackening his efforts, Henry BooK I.
continued to pursue his discoveries with fresh s
ardour.

BUT, in order to silence all the murmurs of apal grant

opposition, he endeavoured to obtain the of what
fanation of the highest authority in favour of ..ou.ld
his operations. With this view, he applied to vco.
the Pope, and represented, in pompous terms,
the pious and unwearied zeal, with which he
had exerted himself during twenty years, in
discovering unknown countries, the wretched
inhabitants of which were utter strangers to true
religion, wandering in heathen darkness, or led
astray by the delusions of Mahomet. He be-
fought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar
of Christ, all the kingdoms of the earth were
subjet, to confer on the crown of Portugal a
right to all the countries possessed by Infidels,
which should be discovered by the industry of
its fubje&ts, and subdued by the force of its
arms. He intreated him to enjoin all Christian
powers, under the highest penalties, not to
molest Portugal while engaged in this laudable
enterprise, and to prohibit them from fettling
in any of the countries which the Portuguese
should discover. He promised that, in all
their expeditions, it should be the chief object
,f his countrymen to spread the knowledge of

F 3 the

Boo., I. the Christian religion, to establish the autho:

riry of the holy fee, and to increafc the flock
of the universal pastor. As it was by improy-
ing vith dexterity every favourable conjuncture
for acquiring new powers, that the court of
Rome had gradually extended its usurpations,
Eugene IV. the pontiff to whom this applica-
tion was made, eagerly seized the opportunity
which now presented itself. He instantly per-
ceived, that by complying vwith prince Henry's
request, he might exercile a prerogative no less
flattering in its own nature, than likely to prove
beneficial in its conlequences. A Bull was ac-
cordingly issued, in which, after applauding in
the strongest terms the pall efforts of the Por-
tuguefe, and exhorting them to proceed in that
laudable career on which they had entered, he
granted them an exclusive right to all the coun-
tries wi:ich they should discover, fro:n Cape
Non to the continent of India.

His schemes were authorised and 'andified by BooK I.
the bull approving of them. The spirit of dif- v
covery was conne&ted with zeal for religion,
which, in that age, was a principle of such
activity and vigour, as to influence the conduet
of nations. All Chrillian princes were deterred
from intruding into those countries which the
Portuguese had discovered, or from interrupting
the progress of their navigation and conquests Y.

THE fame of the Portuguese voyages soon Fam and

spread over Europe. Men, long accustomed h'e' ..
to circumnfcribe the afcivity and knowledge of g-e.t disco-
the human mind within the limits to which
they had been hitherto confined, were astonished
to behold the sphere of navigation so suddenly
enlarged, and a profpeót opened of visiting re-
gions of the globe, the existence of which was
unknown in former times. The learned and
5>.cuhl:ttive reasoned and formed theories con-
cerning those unexpected discoveries. The
:; lirar inquired and wondered; while enter-
:-.cing adventurers crouded from every part of
i'rl!ope, soliciting prince Henry to employ
them in this honourable service. Many Vene-
thins and Genoese, in particular, who were, at
Trii. time, superior to all other nations in the

BooK I. science of naval affairs, entered aboard the Por-

tuguefe ships, and acquired a more perfect and
extensive knowledge of their profession in that
new school of navigation. In emulation of
these foreigners, the Portuguese exerted their
own talents. The nation seconded the designs
of the prince. Private merchants formed com-
1446. panies, with a view to search for unknown coun-

tries. The Cape de Verd islands, which lie
off the promontory of that name, were disco-
;9. vered, and soon after, the ifes called Azores.

As the former of these are above three hundred
miles from the African coast, and the latter
nine hundred miles from any continent, it is
evident, by their venturing so boldly into the
open seas, that the Portuguese had, by this
time, improved greatly in the art of naviga-
tion.

Dath of WHILE the passion for engaging in new un-
P "'- dertakings was thus warm and active, it re-
3,`3. ceived an unfortunate check by the death of

prince Henry, whose superior knowledge had
hitherto directed all the operations of the dif-
coverers, and whose patronage had encouraged
and protected them. But i.o:withffanding all
the advantages which they derived from there,
the Portuguc;e, during his life, did not ad-
vance, in their utmost progre;s towards the

foutih4

south, within five degrees of the equino&cial Boox I.
line; and, after their continued exertions for
half a century, hardly fifteen hundred miles of
the coast of Africa were discovered. To an
age acquainted with the efforts of navigation in
its state of maturity and improvement, those From '421
essays of its early years must necessarily appear 'o 463-
feeble and unskilful. But, inconsiderable as
they may be deemed, they were sufficient to
turn the curiosity of the European nations into
a new channel, to excite an enterprising spirit,
and to point the way to future discoveries.

ALPHONSO, who pofleffed the throne of Por- The parion

tugal at the time of prince Henry's death, was i.,li~,
so much engaged in supporting his own preten- t c..r.
sions to the crown of Castile, or in carrying on
his expeditions against the Moors in Barbary,
that the force of his kingdom being exerted in
other operations, he could not prosecute the
discoveries in Africa with ardour. He com-
mitted the conduct of them to Fernando Go-
mez, a merchant in Lisbon, to whom he granted
an exclusive right of commerce with all the
countries of which prince Henry had taken pof-
feflion. Under the restraint and opprefflon of
a monopoly, the spirit of discovery languished.
It ceased to be a national object, and became
the concern of a private nmn, more attentive

to

BooK I. to his own gain, than to the glory of his coun-

try. Some progress, however, was made. The
1,71,. Portuguese ventured at length to cross the line,

and, to their afRonifhmenr, found that region
of the torrid zone, which was Iuppofed to be
scorched with intolerable heat, to be not only
habitable, but populous and fertile.

,4S,. JOHN II. who succeeded his father Alphonfo,
,U, 2:c;i- possessed talents capable both of forming and

executing great designs. As part of his reve-
nues, while prince, had arisen from duties on
the trade with the newly discovered countries,
this natu.rallv turned his attention towards them,
and satisfied him with respect to their utility and
importance. In proportion as his knowledge
of thei'e countries extended, the possession of
them appeared to be of greater consequence.
Wh:ie the Portuguese proceeded along the coast
of Africa, from Cape Non to the river of Sene-
g-al, thev found all that extensive tract to be

vigour fi-om the countenance of such a monarch
as John. Declaring himself the patron of every
attempt towards discovery, he promoted it with
all the ardour of his grand-uncle prince Henry, .s4
and with fuperipr power. The effets of this
vwcre immediately felt. A powerful fleet was
fitted out, which, after discovering the king-
doms of Benin and Congo, advanced above sis-
teen hundred miles beyond the line, and the
Portuguese, for the first time, beheld a new
heaven, and observed the fears of another he-
mifphere. John was not only solicitous to dif-
cover, but attentive to secure the possession of
tholi countries. He built forts on the coast of

Guinea;

Boos I. Guinea; he sent out colonies to fettle there;
-' he eftablifhfed a commercial intercourse with

the more powerful kingdoms; he endeavoured
to render such as were feeble or divided, tri-
butary to the crown of Portugal. Some of the
petty princes voluntarily acknowledged them-
selves his vassals. Others were compelled to
do so by force of arms. A regular and well
digested system was formed with respect to this
new object of policy, and by firmly adhering
to it, the Portuguese power and commerce in
Africa were eltablifhed upon a solid founda-
tion.

SHo.,c =F, By their conrfant intercourse with the people

'-.'.:-: of Africa, the Portuguese gradually acquired
-: cJ sone knowledge of those parts of that country

which they had not visited. The information
which they received from the natives, added to
what they had observed in their own voyages,
began to open profpeclts more extensive, and to
suggest the idea of schemes more important,
than those which had hitherto allured and oc-
cupied them. They had detected the error of
the ancients concerning the nature of the torrid
zone. They found, as they proceeded south-
wards, that the continent of Africa, instead of
extending in breadth, according to the doc-

trine

trine of Ptolemy ', at that time the oracle and BOOK I.
guide of the learned in the science of geography,
appeared sensibly to contract itself, and to bend
towards the east. This induced them to give
credit to the accounts of the ancient Phenician
voyages round Africa, which had long been
deemed fabulous, and led them to conceive
hopes that by following the fame route, they
might arrive at the East Indies, and engross
that commerce, which has been the source of
wealth and power to every nation poffefied of it.
The comprehensive genius of prince Henry, as
we may conjecture from the words of the pope's
bull, had early formed some idea of this navi-
gation. All the Portuguese pilots and mathe-
maticians now concurred in representing it as
practicable. The king entered with warmth
into their sentiments, and began to concert
measures for this arduous and important voyage.

BEFORE his preparations for this expedition Schemes so

Africa, that various nations along the coast had

'"-v' Portuguese monarch immedi.tely concluded,

that this muff be the emperor of AbyvfEnia, to
whom the Europeans, reduced by a mistake of
Rubruquis, Marco Polo, and other travellers
to the east, absurdly gave the name Prester or
Presbyter John; and as he hoped to receive in-
formation and afliftance from a Christian prince,
in profecuring a scheme that tended to propa-
gate their common faith, he resolved to open,
if poflible, some intercourse with his court.

-ith this view, he made choice of Pedro de

Covillam and Alphonfo de Payva, who were
perfec masters of the Arabic language, and
lent them into the east, to search for the refi-
dence of this unknown potentate, and to make
hima proffers of friendship. They had it in
charge likewise, to procure whatever intelli-

the moll arduous and important which the Por- BOOK I.
tugucfe had ever projected, was committed to
Bartholomlew Diaz, an officer whose sagacity,
experience, and fortitude rendered him equal
to the undertaking. He stretched boldly to-
wards the south, and proceeding beyond the
utmost limits to which his countrymen had
hitherto advanced, discovered near a thousand
miles of a new country. Neither the danger to
which he was exposed, by a succession of violent
rempeits in unknown seas, and by the frequent
mutinies of his crew, nor the calamities of fa-
mine which he suffered from losing his store-
ship, could deter him from prosecuting his en-
terprile. In recompence of his labours and
perfcverance, he at last descried that lofty pro-
monotory which bounds Africa to the south.
But to descry it, was all that he had in his
power to accomplish. The violence of the
winds, the shattered condition of his ships, and
tile turbulent Ipirit of his tailors, compelled
him to return, after a voyage of sixteen months,
in which he discovered a far greater extent of
country than any former navigator. Diaz had
called the promontory which terminated his
voyage Cabo Tormentofo, or the stormy Cape;
but the 1king, his master, as he now entertained
nu doubt of having found the long desired route

to

BooK I. to India, gave it a name more inviting, and of
''""' better omen, The Cape of Good Hope '.

More Ce- THOSE sanguine expe&ations of success were
tAin Dr-
sp-a, of confirmed by the intelligence which John re-

ceived over land, in consequence of his em-
baffy to Abyflinia. Covillam and Payva, in
obedience to their master's inftruftions, had
repaired to Grand Cairo. From that city, they
travelled along with a caravan of Egyptian mer-
chants, and embarking on the Red Sea, ar-
rived at Aden in Arabia. There they fepa-
rated; Pavva failed direUctly towards Abyssinia;
Covillam embarked for the East Indies, and
having visited Calecut, Goa, and other cities
on the Malabar coast, returned to Sofala, on
the east fide of Africa, and thence to Grand
Cairo, which Payva and he had fixed upon as
their place of rendezvous. Unfortunately the
former was cruelly murdered in Abyflinia, but
Covillam found at Cairo two Portuguese Jews,
whom John, whose provident fagaciry attended

quiring some knowledge of the Latin tongue,
the only language in which science was taught
at that time, he was instructed in geometry,
cosmography, astronomy, and the art of draw-
ing. To these he applied with such ardour and
predilection, on account of their connection'
with navigation, his favourite object, that he
advanced with rapid proficiency in the fludy of
454s. them. Thus qualified, he went to sea at the

age of fourteen, and began his career on that
element which condudted him to so much
glory. His early voyages were to thafe ports
in the Mediterranean which his countrymen
417. the Genoese frequented. This being a sphere

too narrow for his active mind, he made an ex-
curfion to the northern seas, and visited the
coasts of Iceland, to which the English and
other nations had begun to retort on account of
its filhery. As navigation, in every direrion,
was now become enterprising, he proceeded
bevond that island, the Thule of the ancients,
and advanced several degrees within the polar
circle. Having satisfied his curiofitv by a
voyage which tended more to enlarge his know-
ledge of naval affairs, than to improve his for-
tun:., he entered into the service of a famous
iea-capt:in, of his own name and family. This
r-a.n conmimanJcd a fmail squadron, fitted out at

h.is

his own expence, and by cruising sometimes BooK II.
against the Mahometans, Sometimes against the "
Venetians, the rivals of his country in trade,
had acquired both wealth and reputation. With
him Columbus continued for several years, no
lei's distinguished for his courage, than for his
experience as a sailor. At length, in an ob-
ftinate engagement, off the coast of Portugal,
with Ibme Venetian caravels, returning richly
laden from the Low Countries, the vessel on
board which he served took fire, together with
one of the enemy's ships, to which it was fast
grappled. In this dreadful extremity his intre-
pidity and pretence of mind did not forsake
him. He threw himself into the sea, laid hold
of a floating oar, and by the support of it, and
his dexterity in swimming, he reached the
shore, though above two leagues distant, and
saved a life reserved for great undertakings b

As soon as he recovered strength for the He ener,
journey, he repaired to Lisbon, where many of ipto the

his countrymen were fettled. They soon con- servic-
ccived such a favourable opinion of his merit,
as well as talents, that they warmly solicited him
to remain in that kingdom, where his naval

mated either with curiosity to visit new coun-
tries, or with ambition to distinguish himself,
the Portuguese lervice was at that time ex-
tremely inviting. Columbus listened with a
favourable ear to the advice of his friends, and
ha.ving gained the esteem of a Portug-uese lady,
w.-hom he married, fixed his residence in Lisbon.
This alliance, instead of detaching him from a
sea-faring life, contributed to enlarge the sphere
of his naval knowledge, and to excite a desire
of extending it fsill farther. His wife was a
daughter of Bartholomew Perellrello, one of
the captains employed by prince HI enrv in his
early navigations, and who, under his protec-
tion, had discovered and planted the islands of
Porto Santo and Madeira. Columbus got pof-
;elfion of the journals and charts of this expe-
rienced navigator, and from them he learned
the course which the Portuguese had held in
making their discoveries, as well as the various
circum.tar.ces which guided or encouraged them
in ihe - atte.rpts. The fludy of thele soothed
and ir.;'..mc his favourite passion; and while
he cn:~emn!ated the maps, and read the delcrip-
rt:ons ao the new countries which Pereftrello had

intercourse was carried on by sea, he was now
become one of the molt skilful navigators in
Europe. But, not satisfied with that praise,
his ambition aimed at something more. The
successful progress of the Portuguese navigators
had awakened a spirit of curiosity and emula-
tion, which set every man of science upon ex-
amining all the circumstances that led to the
diflovcries which they had made, or that as-
forded a profpet of succeeding in any new and
bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus,
naturally inquisitive, capable of deep reflection,
and turned to speculations of this kind, was so
often employed in revolving the principles upon
which the Portuguese had founded their schemes
of discovery, and the mode in which they had
carried them on, that he gradually began to
form an idea of improving upon their plan, and
Js accomplishing discoveries which hitherto they
had zittempted in vain.

To

Boor II. To find out a passage by sea to the East In.
H.- foa-- dies, was the great object in view at that period.
1art"° From the time that the Portuguese doubled

X Cape de Verd, this was the point at which they

aimed in all their navigations, and, in com-
parison with it, all their discoveries in Africa
appeared inconsiderable. The fertility and
riches of India had been known for many agesi
its spices and other valuable commodities were
in high request throughout Europe, and the
vast wealth of the Venetians arising from their
having engrossed this trade, had raised the envy
of all nations. But how intent soever the Por-
tuguefe were upon discovering a new route to
those desirable regions, they searched for it only
by fleering towards the south, in hopes of ar-
riving at India, by turning to the east, after
they had failed round the farther extremity of
Africa. This course was still unknown, and,
even if discovercd, was of such immenfc length,
that a voyage fro m Europe to India must have
appeared an undertaking extremely arduous,
and of very uncertain issue. More than half a
century had been employed in advancing from
Cap>e Non to the equator; a much longer space
of time might elapse before the more extensive
navigation from that to India could be accom-
plifhed. Thcse refections upon the uncertainty,
the danger and tcdioufnefa of the course which

the

the Portuguese were pursuing, naturally led BooK II.
Columbus to confider whether a shorter and '
more direc passage to the East Indies might
not be found out. After revolving long and
seriously every circumiftance suggested by his
superior knowledge in the theory as well as
practice of navigation, after comparing at-
tentively the observations of modern pilots with
the hints and conjectures of ancient authors, he
at last concluded, that by failing directly to-
wards the weft, across the Atlantic ocean, new
countries, which probably formed a part of the
vast continent of India, must infallibly be dif-
covered.

PRINCIPLES and arguments of various kinds, The princi-

ples on

and derived from different sources, induced him which his
to adopt this opinion, fceemingly as chimerical h^ycc "
as it was new and extraordinary. The fpheri-
cal figure of the earth was known, and its mag-
nitude ascertained with some degree of ac-
curacy. From this it was evident, that the
continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, formed
but a fimall portion of the terraqueous globe.
It was suitable to our ideas concerning the wis-
dlom and beneficence of the Author of Nature,
to believe that the vast space, still unexplored,
was not covered entirely by a waste unprofitable
ocean, but occupied by countries fit for the ha-

3 bitation

BooK II. biration of man. It appeared likewise ex-

tremely probable, that the continent, on this
fide of the globe, was balanced by a propor-
tional quantity of land in the other hemisphere.
These conclusions concerning the existence of
another continent, drawn from the figure and
jfructure of the globe, were confirmed by the
obfervatons and conjeclures of modern naviga-
tors. A Portuguese pilot, having stretched
farther to the weft than was usual at that time,
took up a piece of timber artificially carved,
floating upon the sea; and as it was driven to-
wards him by a westerly wind, he concluded
that it came from some unknown land, situated
in that quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law
had found, to the weft of the Madeira isles, a
piece of timber fashioned in the fame manner,
and brought by the fame wind; and had seen
l:kewife canes of an enormous size floating upQn
the waves, which resembled those described by
Ptolem.v as productions peculiar to the East In-
l.:es After a course of westerly winds, trees,
torn up by the roo:s, were often driven upon
the coasts of the Azores, and at one time the
cUad bodies of two men, with singular features,
resembling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor
9f. frica, were cast athore there.

As

As the force of this united evidence, arising BooK II.

from theoretical principles and practical obfer-
vations, led Columbus to expect the discovery
of new countries in the Western Ocean, other
reasons induced him to believe that these must
be conne&ted with the continent of India,
Though the ancients had hardly ever pene-
trated into India farther than the banks of the
Ganges, yet some Greek authors had ventured
to describe the provinces beyond that river.
As men are prone, and at liberty, to magnify
what is remote or unknown, they represented
them as regions of an immense extent. Ctefias
affirmed that India was as large as all the reft
of Asia. Oneficritus, whom Pliny the natu-
ralift follows , contended that it was equal to
a third part of the habitable earth. Nearchus
asserted, that it would take four months to
march in a straight line from one extremity of
it to the other '. The journal of Marco Polo,
who had proceeded towards the East far beyond
the limits to which any European had ever
adivanced, seemed to confirm there exaggerated
accounts of the ancients. By his magnificent
dcfcriptions of the kingdoms of Cathay and
L:.ngo, and of many other countries, the

~'--'-' India appeared to be a region of vast extent.

From these accounts, which, however defective,
were the most accurate that the people of
Europe had at that period received, with refpe&f
to the remote parts of the East, Columbus
drew a just conclusion. He contended, that,
in proportion as the continent of India stretched
out towards the East, it must, in consequence
of the spherical figure of the earth, approach
nearer to the islands which had lately been dif-
covered to the weft of Africa; that the distance
from the one to the other was probably not
very considerable; and that the molt direc&, as
well as shortest course, to the remote regions
of the East, was to be found by failing due
weft g. This notion concerning the vicinity
of India to the western parts of our continents
was countenanced by tome eminent writers
among the ancients, the fantion of whose
authority was necessary, in that age, to pros
cure a favourable reception to any tenet.
Aritotle thought it probable that the Columns
of Hercules, or Straits of Gibraltar, were not
far removed from the East Indies, and that
there might be a communication by lea between

them h. Seneca, in terms still more explicit, BooK II.
affirms, that, with a fair wind, one might fail '
from Spain to India in a few days'. The
famous Atlantic island described by Plato, and
fiuppofed by many to be a real country, beyond
which a vast unknown continent was situated,
is represented by him as lying at no great
distance from Spain. After weighing all these
particulars, Columbus, in whose character the
modesty and diffidence of true genius was
united with the ardent enthufiafin of a pro-
jector, did not reft with such absolute assurance
either upon his own arguments, or upon the
authority of the ancients, as not to consult
fiuch of his contemporaries -as were capable -of
comprehending the nature of the evidence
which he produced in support of his opinion.
As early as the year one thousand four hundred
and Ieventy-four, he communicated his ideas
concerning the probability of discovering new
countries, by failing westwards, to Paul, a
physician of Florence, eminent for his know-
ledge of cosmography, and who, from the
learning as well as candour which he discovers
in his reply, appears to have been well intitled
to the confidence which Columbus placed in

BeoK II. him. He warmly approved of the plan, fug-
'-- " gested several facts in confirmation of it, and

encouraged Columbus to persevere in an un-
dertaking so laudable, and which must redound
so much to the honour of his country, and the
benefit of Europe `.

P:t r;.-.s To a mind less capable of forming and of
f ^,' executing great designs than that of Columbus,
cu vz all those reasonings, and observations, and

authorities, would have served only as the
foundation of some plausible and fruitless theory,
which might have furnished matter for inge-
nious discourse, or fanciful conjecture. But
with his sanguine and enterprising temper, fpe-
culation led directlv to aftion. Fully satisfied
himself with respect to the truth of his system,
he was impatient to bring it to the test of ex-
periment, and to set out upon a voyage of
discovery. The first flep towards this was to
secure the patronage of some of the confider-
able powers in Europe, capable of undertaking
such an enterprise. As long absence had not
extinguished the affection which he bore to his
native country, he wished that it should reap

H.-:"-! the fruits of his labours and invention. With
l-,o :'- th:s v-ew, he laid his scheme before the senate

tender of his service, offered to fail under the
banners of the republic, in quellt of the new
regions which he expected to discover. But
Columbus had resided for so many years in
foreign parts, that his countrymen were unac-
quainted with his abilities and character; and,
though a maritime people, they were so little
accuflomed to distant voyages~ that they could
form no just idea of the principles on which he
founded his hopes of success. They inconfi-
derately rejected his proposal, as the dream
of a chimerical projector, and loft for ever the
opportunity of restoring their commonwealth
to its ancient splendour'.

HAVING performed what was due to his tothek;ne

country, Columbus was so little discouraged of Po°tug
by the repulse which he had received, that, in-
stead of relinquishing his undertaking, he pur-
sued it with fresh ardour. He made his next
overtuIe to John II. king of Portugal, in
whose dominions he had been long eftablilhed,
and whom he corifidered, oh that account, as
having the second claim to his service. Here
every circumstance seemed to promise him a
more favourable reception. He applied to a

petent judge in naval affairs, and proud of
patronising every attempt to discover new
countries. His fubje'ts were the most expe-
rienced navigators in Europe, and the least
apt to be intimidated either by the novelty
or boldness of any maritime expedition. In
Portugal, the profe/Eonal skill of Columbus,
as well as his personal good qualities, were
thoroughly known; and as the former ren-
dered it probable that his scheme was not alto-
ge:ine. chimerical, the latter exempted him
from the suspicion of any sinister intention in
proposing it. Accordingly, the king listened
TO him in the most gracious manner, and
referred the consideration of his plan to Diego
Ortiz, bishop of Ceuta, and two Jewish phy-
f.cians, eminent cofinographers, whom he
was accustomed to consult in matters of this
kind. As in Genoa, ignorance had opposed
and dilappointed Columbus; in Lisbon, he
had to combat with prejudice, an enemy no
lets formidable. The persons, according to
whose decision his scheme was to be adopted
or rejected, had been the chief directors of the
Portuguese navigations, and had advised to
search for a passage to India, by fleering a
courie directly opposite to that which Columbus
recommended as shorter and more certain.

starting innumerable obje&ions, with a view
of betraying him into such a particular expla-
nation of his fvftem, as might draw from him
a full discovery of its nature, they deferred
pasSing a final judgment with refpeft to it.
In the mean time, they conspired to rob him
of the honour and advantages which he ex-
peded from the success of his scheme, advising
the king to dispatch a vessel, secretly, in order
to attempt the proposed discovery, by follow-
ing exactly the course which Columbus seemed
to point out. John, forgetting on this occa-
flon the sentiments becoming a monarch,
meanly adopted this perfidious counsel. But
the pilot, chose-n to execute Columbus's plan,
had neither the genius, nor the fortitude of its
:ianhor. Contrary winds arose, no fight of ap-
proaching land appeared, his courage failed,
andi he returned to Lisbon, execrating the pro-
ject as equally extravagant and dangerous '.

his resentment determined to break off all in-
tercourfe with a nation capable of such flagrant
treachery. He instantly quitted the kingdom,
and landed in Spain towards the close of the
year one thousand four hundred and eighty-
four. As he was now at liberty to court the
protection of any patron, whom he could en-
gage to approve of his plan, and to carry it
into execution, he resolved to propose it in
person, to Ferdinand and Isabella, who at that
time governed the united kingdoms of Castile

s-i.s h;i and Aragon. But, as he had already expe-
zErad." rienced the uncertain issue of applications to

kings and ministers, he took the precaution of
fending into England his brother Bartholomew,
to whom he had fully communicated his ideas,
in order that he might negociate, at the fame
time, with Henry VII. who was reputed one
of the most sagacious as well as opulent princes
in Europe.

oscls, :o zr was not without reason that Columbus
jr" a-cc'i entertained doubts and fears with respect to
: SPan.

the reception of his proposals in the Spanish
court. Spain was, at that juncture, engaged
isn a dangerous war with Granada, the last of
the Moorish kingdoms. The wary and fufpi-
cious temper of Ferdinand was not formed to

relish

relith bold or uncommon designs. Isabella, BOOK 11.
though more generous and enterprising, was
under the influence of her husband in all her
actions. The Spaniards had hitherto made no
efforts to extend navigation beyond its ancient
limits, and had beheld the amazing progress
of discovery anmong their neighbours the Por-
tuguefe, without one attempt to imitate or to
rival them. The war with the Infidels afforded
an ample field, to the national activity and
love of glory. Under circumstances so unfa-
vourable, it was impossible for Columbus to
make rapid progress with a nation, naturally
flow and dilatory in forming all its resolutions.
His character, however, was admirably adapted
to that of the people, whose confidence and
proteaion he solicited. He was grave, though
courteous in his deportment; circumspect in
his words and actions; irreproachable in his
morals; and exemplary in his attention to
all the duties and functions of religion. By
qualities so refpe&able, he not only gained
many private friends, but acquired such gene-
ral esteem, that, notwithstanding the plainness
of his appearance, suitable to the mediocrity
of his fortune, he was not confidered as a mere
adventurer, to whom indigence had suggested
a viflonary projet, but was received as a per-

the consideration of his plan to the queen's
confessor, Ferdinand de Talavera. He con-
fulted such of his countrymen, as were sup-
posed belt qualified to decide with refpe& to a
subject of this kind. But true science had,
hitherto, made so little progress in Spain, that
the pretended philosophers, feleaed to judge
in a matter of such moment, did not compre-
hend the first principles, upon which Columbus
founded his conije&ures and hopes. Some of
them, from mistaken notions concerning the
dimensions of the globe, contended that a
voyage to those remote parts of the east, which
Columbus expected to discover, could not be
pernir.ned in less than three years. Others
concluded, that ei:her he would find the ocean
to be of infinite exlent, according to the opi-
nion of omne ancient philosophers; or, if he
fhou d perfilt in Ileering towards the weft be-
yond a certain point, that the convex figure
of the globe v.ould prevent his return, and
that he n-uft inevitably perifli, in the vain

attcnmpt,

attempt, to open a communication between the Bop .L;
two opposite hemispheres, which nature had for
ever disjoined. Even without deigning to
enter into any particular discussion, many re-
jeced the icheme in general, upon the credit
of a maxim, under which the ignorant and
unenterprifing shelter themselves in every age,
" That it is presumptuous in any person, to
suppose that he alone possesses knowledge fupe-
rior to all the reft of mankind united." They
maintained, that if there were really any such
countries as Columbus pretended, they could
not have remained so long concealed, nor
would the wisdom and sagacity of former ages
have left the glory of this invention to art
obscure Genoese pilot.

IT required all Columbus's patience and who make

an unfa-
address to negociate with men capable of ad- vourable

report con-

vancing such strange propositions. He had to cerningit.
contend not only with the obstinacy of igno-
rance, but with what is still more intractable, the
pride of false knowledge. After innumerable
conferences, and wafting five years in fruitless
endeavours to inform and to satisfy judges so
little capable of deciding with propriety, Tala-
vera, at lasl, made such an unfavourable report
to Ferdinand and Isabella, as induced them to
acquaint Columbus, that until the war with

H 4 the

Boot IL the Moors Ihould be brought to a period,. it

'~' would be imprudent to engage in any new and

expenlive enterprise.

WH4TEVER care was taken to soften the

harshness of this declaration, Columbus con-
fidered it as a final rejecion of his proposals.
But happily for mankind, that superiority of
genius, which is capable of forming great and
uncommon designs, is usually accompanied
with an ardent enthusiasm, which can neither
be cooled by delays, nor damped by difap-
pointment. Columbus was of this sanguine
temper. Though he felt deeply the cruel
blow given to his hopes, and retired immedi-
ately from a court, where he had been amused
so long with vain expectations, his confidence
in the justness of his own system did not dimi-
ni;;, and his impatience to demonstrate the
truth of it by an actual experiment became
greater than ever. Having courted the pro-
tecion of sovereign frates without success, he
applied, next, to persons of inferior rank, and
..idreffed successively the dukes of Medina
Sadonia, and Medina Celi, who, though sub-
jests, were possessed of power and opulence
more than equal to the enterprise which he
projected. His negociations with them proved
as fruitless, as those in which he had been

hitherto

hitherto engaged; for-thefe noblemen were BooIC I.
either as little convinced by Columbus's argu-
gnents as their superiors, or they were afraid
of alarming the jealousy, and offending the
pride of Ferdinand, by countenancing a scheme
which he had reje&ed".

AMID the painful sensations occasioned by Negtci.tion

such a succession of disappointments, Columbus othisbrn.
had to sustain the additional distress, of having lant.
received no accounts of his brother, whom he
had sent to the court of England. In his
voyage to that country, Bartholomew had been
so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of
pirates, who having stripped him of every
thing, detained him a prisoner for several years.
At length, he made his escape, and arrived in
London, but in such extreme indigence, that
he was obliged to employ himself during a
considerable time, in drawing and felling maps,
in order to pick up as much money as would
purchase a decent dress, in which he might
venture to appear at court. He then laid be-
fore the king the proposals, with which he had
been entrusted by his brother, and, notwith-
standing Henry's excessive caution and parsi-
mony, which rendered him averse to new or

hopes of meeting with a more favourable
reception there. He had already made pre-
parations for this purpose, and taken measures
for the dilpofal of his children during his
abfcnce, when Juan Perez, the guardian of
the monastery of Rabida, near Palos, in which
they had been educated, earnestly solicited him
to defer his journey for a thort time. Perez
was a man of considerable learning, and of
some credit with Queen Isabella, to whom he
was known personally. He was warmly attach-
ed to Columbus, with whose abilities as well as
integrity he had many opportunities of being
acquainted. Prompted by curiosity or by
friendihip, he entered upon an accurate exa-
mination of his system, in conjunction with a
physician fettled in the neighbourhood, who
was a considerable proficient in mathematical
knowledge. This investigation satisfied them
si thoroughly, with refpeft to the foliditv of

the

the principles on which Colurrbus founded his H1or II.
opinion, and the probability bs success in exe-.
cuting the plan which he proposed, that Perez;
in order to prevent his country from being
deprived of the glory and benefit, which mufft
accrue to the patrons of such a grand enter-
prise, ventured to write to Isabella, conjuring
her to confider the matter anew, with the
attention which it merited.

MOVED by the representations of a person

whom ffie refpeted, Isabella desired Perez to
repair immediately to the village of Santa Fe,
in which, on account of the siege of Granada,
the court resided at that time, that she might
confer with him upon this important fubje&.
The firll effe& of their interview was a gracious
invitation of Columbus back to court, accom- ,49,
panied with the present of a small fum to equip
him for the journey. As there was now. a
certain profpe&, that the war with the Moors
would speedily be brought to an happy issue
bL the reduction of Granada, which would
leave the nation at liberty to engage in new
undertakings; this, as well as the mark of
royal favour, with which Columbus had been
lately honoured, encouraged his friends to ap-
pear with greater confidence than formerly in
support of his scheme. The chief of there,

Alonfo

Boo 11. Alonfo de Quintanilla, comptroller of the
t'--w' finances in Castile, and Luis de Santangel,

receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues in Aragon,
whose meritorious zeal in promoting this great
design entitles their names to an honourable
place in history, introduced Columbus to many
persons of high rank, and interested them.
warmly in his behalf.

,,it-Df- BUT it was not an easy matter to inspire
w1'1
- i_ Ferdinand with favourable sentiments. He

frill regarded Columbus's project as extrava-
gant and chimerical, and in order to render
the efforts of his partizans ineffectual, he had
the address to employ in this new negociation
with him, some of the persons who had for-
merly pronounced his scheme to be impra&ti-
cable. To their astonishment, Columbus ap-
peared before them with the fame confident
hopes of success as formerly, and insisted upon
the fame high recompence, He proposed that
a small fleet mhould be fitted out, urlder.his
command, to attempt the discovery, and de-
manded to be appointed hereditary admiral
and viceroy of all the seas and lands which he
should dilcover, and to have the tenth of the
profits arising from them, fettled irrevocably.
upon hinifelf and his descendants. At the
fame time, he offered to advance the eighth

part

part of theTfuM necessary for acc'oiplifhing his Bos~
design, on condition .that he fihould be eftitled '
to a proportional share of benefit from the
adventure. If the enterprise should totally
miscarry, he made no stipulation for any reward
or emolument whatever. Instead of viewing
this conduct as the clearest evidence of his full
persuasion with refpe& to the truth of his own
system, or being struck with that magnanimity,
which, after so many delays and repulses,
would stoop to nothing inferior to its original
claims, the persons with whom Columbus
treated, began meanly to calculate the expence
of the expedition, and the value of the reward
which he demanded. The expence, moderate
as it was, they represented to be too great for
Spain, in the present exhausted state of its
finances. They contended, that the honours
and emoluments claimed by Columbus, were
exorbitant, even if he should perform the
utmost of what he had promised ; and if all his
sanguine hopes should prove illusive, such vast
concessions to an adventurer would be deemed
not only inconsiderate, but ridiculous. In this
imposing garb of caution and prudence, their
opinion appeared so plausible, and was so
warmly supported by Ferdinand, that Isabella
declined giving any countenance to Columbus,

and

Booa I. and abruptly broke off the negociation with
.v- him which she had begun.

THis was more mortifying to Columbus than

all the dilappointments which he had hitherto
met with. The invitation to court from Ifa-
bella, like an unexpected ray of light, had
opened such profpefts of success, as encouraged
him to hope that his labours were at an end;
but now darkness and uncertainty returned,
and his mind, firm as it was, could hardly
support the Ihock of such an unforeseen reverse.
He withdrew in deep anguish from court, with
an intention of prosecuting his voyage to Eng-
land, as his last resource.

.t ABOUT that time Granada surrendered, and

,I~t:-. Ferdinand and Ifibella, in triumphal pomp,
j~^ z. Itook pofieffion of a city, the reduction of which

extirpated a foreign power from the heart of
their dominions, and rendered them makfers
of all the provinces, extending from the bottom
of the Pyrenees to the frontiers of Portugal.
As the flow of spirits which accompanies fuc-
cess elevates the mind, and renders it enter-
prifing, QOintanilla and Santangel, the vigilant
and difeerning patrons of Columbus, took ad-
vantage of this favourable situation, in order
to make one eGfort more in behalf of their

6 friend.

friend. They addressed themselves to Isabella, BooK II.
and, after expressing some surprise, that. she,. '
who had always been the munificent patroness
of generous undertakings, should hesitate fq
long to countenance the most splendid scheme
that had ever been proposed to any monarch;
they represented to her, that Columbus was a
man of a found understanding and virtuous
character, well qualified, by his experience in
navigation, as well as his knowledge of geo-
metry, to form just ideas with refpecf to the
firucture of the globe and the situation of its
various regions; that, by offering to risk his
own life and fortune in the execution of his
fchelne, he gave the most satisfying evidence
both of his integrity and hope of success that
the fum requisite for equipping such an arma-
ment as he demanded was inconsiderable, and
the advantages which might accrue from his
undertaking were immense; that he demanded
no recompence for his invention and labour,
but what was to arise from the countries which
he fllould discover; that, as it was worthy
of her magnanimity to make this noble attempt
to extend the sphere of human knowledge, and
to open an intercourse with regions hitherto
unknown, so it would afford the highest satis-
factioni to her piety and zeal, after re-eftabliLh-

ing

Booar I. ing the Christian faith in t-hofe-provinces' {f

Spain from which it had been loneg hahiifted
to discover a new world, to which she might
communicate the light and blessings of divine
truth; that if now The did not decide instantly,
the opportunity would be irretrievably loft;
that Columbus was on his way to foreign Coun-
tries, where some prince, more fortunate or
adventurous, would close with his propofalsi
and Spain would for ever bewail the fatalt inA-
dity which had excluded her fronT the* glory
and advantages that the had once int her power
to have enjoyed.

THESE forcible arguments, urged by person§

of such authority, and at a juncture so well
chosen, produced the desired effect. They
dispelled all Isabella's doubts and fears; the
ordered Columbus to be instantly recalled,
declared her resolution of employing him on
his own terms, and regretting the low state of
her finances, generously offered to pledge her
own jewels, in order to raise as much money
as might be needed in making preparations for
the voyage. Santangel, in a transport of grd-
titude, kissed the queen's hand, and in ord'r
to save her from having recourse to such ha
mortify i.g expedient for procuring money, en-

CoLUivtBus had proceeded some leagues on Thecondi-

his journey, when the messenger from Ilabella agreemr.t
overtook him. Upon receiving an account of with Spain.
the unexpected revolution in his favour, he
returned directly to Santa Fe, though some
remainder of diffidence still mingled itself with
his joy. But the cordial reception which he
met with from Ifabellaj together with the near
prospect of setting out upon that voyage which
had so long been the object of his thoughts and
wishes, soon effaced the remembrance of all
that he had suffered in Spain, during eight
tedious years of solicitation and suspense. The
negociation now went forward with facility arnd
dispatch, and a treaty or capitulation with
Coli.mbus was signed on the seventeenth of
April, one thousand four hundred and ninety,

,'onjoined with that of Isabella in this :rranf-
aftion, his distrust of Columbus was sti-ll so
violent, that he refused to take any part in the
enterprise, as king of Aragon. As the whole
expence of the expedition was to be defrayed
by the crown of Castile, Isabella r6ferved for
her fubjetts of that kingdom an exclusive right
to all the benefits which might redound: from
its success.

As soon as the treaty was signed, Isabella, The pore-

tuins for

by her attention and activity in forwarding the hiisoyag.
preparations for the voyage, endeavoured to
make some reparation to Columbus for the
tinme which he had loft in fruitless solicitation.

y' the twelfth of May, all that depended upon
her was adjusted; and Columbus waited on the
king and queen, in order to receive their final
instructions. Every thing refpefting the defti-
nation and condu& of the voyage, they com-
mitted implicitly to the disposal of his pru-
dence. But, that they might avoid giving any
jull cause of offence to the king of Portugal,
they strictly enjoined him not to approach near
to the Portuguese settlements on the coast of
Guinea, nor in any of the other countries to
which the Portuguese claimed right as disco-
voercrs. Isabella had ordered the (hips, of

I 2 which

Boor II. which Columbus was to take the command, to
-,.. be fitted out in the port of Palos, a finall ma-

ritime town in the province of Andalusia, As
the guardian Juan Perez, to whom Columbus
had already been so much indebted, resided in
the neighbourhood of this place, he, by the in-
fluence of that good ecclefiafric, as well as by
his own connecion with the inhabitants, not
only raised among them what he wanted of the
fum that he was bound by treaty to advance,
but engaged several of them to accompany him
in the voyage. The chief of these associates
were three brothers of the name of Pinzon, of
considerable wealth, and of great experience in
naval affairs, who were willing to hazard their
lives and fortunes in the expedition.

BtTz after all the efforts of Ilabella and Co-

lumbus, the armament was not suitable either
to the dignity of the nation by which it was
equipped, or to the importance of the service
for which it was destined. It confifled of three
vesSels. The largest, a ship of no considerable
burden, was commanded by Columbus, as ad-
miral, who gave it the name of Santa Maria,
out of respec't for the Blessed Virgin, whom he
honoured with singular devotion. Of the fe-
cond, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon was cap-
tain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third,

named

named the NWgna, was under the command of BooK I11.
Vincent Yanez Pinzon.. These. two were light z,9.
vessels, -hardly superior in burden or force to
large boats. This Iquadron, if it merits'that
name, was vi&tualed for twelve months; and had
on board ninety men, mostly sailors, together
with a few adventurers who followed the fortune
of Columbus, and some gentlemen of Isabella's
court, whom she appointed to accompany, him.
Though the expence of the undertaking was
one of the circumstances which chiefly alarmed
the court of Spain, and retarded so long the ne-
gociation with Columbus, the fum employed
in fitting out this squadron did not exceed four
thousand pounds.

As the art of ship-building in the fifteenth

century was extremely rude, and the bulk of
vessels was accommodated to the short and easy
voyages along the coast which they were accuf.
tomed to perform, it is a proof of the courage
as well as enterprising genius of Columbus, that
he ventured, with a fleet so unfit for a dilfant
navigation, to explore unknown seas, where he
had no chart to guide him, no knowledge of
the tides and currents, and no experience of the
dangers to which he might be exposed. His
eagerness to accomplish the great design which
had so long epgroffed his thoughts, made him

14g
9 would have intimidazed a mind less -adven-

turous. He pushed forward the preparations
with such ardour, and was seconded lb effectually
by the perions to whom Isabella committed the
fuperinter.dence of this business, that every
thing was soon in readiness for the voyage. But
as Columbus was deeply impressed with lenti-
ments of religion, he would not set ou; upon
an expedi:ion so arduous, and of which one
grear obie&t was to extend the knowledge of the
Ch-ih'iiasn faith, without imploring publickly
the guidance and prateEcion of Heaven. With
ttiis view, he, together with all the persons
under his comni-and, marched in solemn pro-.
co^ion to thme mona'ierv of Rabida. After
confcsirng their lEns, and obtaining absolution,
they rc-ceived the holy facramcnt from the
hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers
to '.:irs :or th.e fucceis of an enterprifc which
he had so zealoufiy patronized.

F'-' *-,-- NErT morning, being Friday the third. day
s,-... of August, in the year one thousand four hun-

Heaven for the prosperous issue of the voyage,
which they wi£hed, rather than expected. Co-

lumbus

lumibus steered direatly for the Canary Islands, Boo. II.
and arrived there without any occurrence that g-,.
would have deserved notice on any other occa- A,,ut ,3.
sion. But, in a voyage of such expectation and
importance, every circumstance was the objeci
of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke
loose, the day after she left the harbour, and
that accident alarmed the crew, no less super-
f1itious than unskilful, as a certain omen of the
unfortunate destiny of the expedition. Even
in the fhlort run to the Canaries, the flips were
fbund to be to crazy and ill appointed, as to be
very improper for a navigation which was ex-
pecaed to be both long and dangerous. Co-
lumbus refitted them, however, to the best of
his power, and having supplied himself with
fresh provisions, he took his departure from
Gomeera, one of the moll westerly of the Ca-
nary islands, on the sixth day of September.

HTERE the voyage of discovery may properly rT!, cterfe
be said to begin; for Columbus holding his ,hei' h

and unknown seas. The first d.y, as it was

when they contemplated the boldness of the un-

BoR tP. dertaking, began to beat their breafs, and to
»,g= 1shed tears, as if they were never more to behold

land. Columbus comforted them with affur-
ances of success, and the profpe& of vast wealthl
in those opulent regions whither he was con-
ducting them. This early difcoyery of the
spirit of his followers taught Columbus, that
he must prepare to struggle, not only with the
unavoidable difficulties which might be ex-
perted from the nature of his undertaking, but
with such as were likely to arise from the ig-
norance and timidity of the people under his
command i and he perceived that the art of go-
vern!:g the minds of men would be no less re-
quifite for accomplishing the discoveries which
he had in view, than naval skill and undaunted
courage. Happily for himself, and for the
country by which he was employed, he joined
to the ardent temper and inventive genius of a
proje or, virtues of another species, which are
rarely urnited with them. He possessed a
thorough knowledge of mankind, an insinuating
address, a pa:ieqt perseverance in executing any
plan, the perfect government of his own passions,
and the talent of acquiring an ascendant over
those of other men. All these qualities, which
formed him for command, were accompanied
with that superior knowledge of his profession,
which be.ets confidence in times of difficulty

and

and -danger. To unskilful Spani(h sailors, B9pK IS,
accuRomeed only to coasting voyages in the Me- 9' '
diterranean, the maritime science. of Columbus ,Vngiatc-
the fruit of thirty years experience, improved tion of co.
by an acquaintance with all the inventions of
the Portuguese, appeared immense. As soon
as they put to sea, he regulated every thing by
his sole authority he superintended the execu-
cution of every order; and allowing himself
only a few hours for sleep, he was at all other
times upon deck. As his course lay through
leas which had not formerly been visited, the
founding-line, or instruments for observation,
were continually in his hands. After the ex-
ample of the Portuguese discoverers, he at,
tended to the motion of tides and currents,
watched the flight of birds, the appearance of
fishes, of sea-weeds, and of every thing that
floated on the waves, and entered every occur-
rence, with a minute exac&nefs, in the journal
which he kept. As the length of the voyage
could not fail of alarming sailors habituated
only to short excursions, Columbus endeavoured
to conceal from them the real progress which
they made. With this view, though they run
eighteen leagues on the second day after they
left Gomera, he gave out that they had ad-
vanced only fifteen, and he uniformly employed
the fame artifice of reckoning short during the

whole

BocK II. whole voyage. By the fourteenth of Septem-

ber, the fleet was above two hundred leagues
to the weft of the Canary Isles, at a greater
distance from land than any Spaniard had been

.A-- a-- before that time. There they were struck with
°,.°....f an appearance no lets astonishing than new.
i' ..." They observed, that the magnetic needle, in

their compasses, did not point exactly to the
polar flar, but varied towards the weit; and as
they proceeded, this variation increased. This
appearance, which is now familiar, though it
fill remains one of the mysteries of nature, into
the cause of which the sagacity of man hath not
been able to penetrate, filled the companions
of Columbus with terror. They were now in
a boundless unknown ocean, far from the usual
course of navigation; nature itself seemed to
be altered, and the only guide which they had
left was about to fail them. Columbus, with
no lets quickness than ingenuity, invented a
realon for this appeal ance, which, though it did
not satisfy himself, seemed lb plausible to them,
tha: it dispelled their fears, or filtnced their
murmurs.

gaic with filch uniform rapidity, that it was
Itlde(m neceftary to shift a fail. When about
four hundir.:d leagues to the weft of the Ca-
naries, he found the sea so covered with weeds,
that it resembled a meadow of vast extent;. and
in fume places they were so thick, as to retard
the motion of the vessels. This Itrange appear-
ance occasioned new alarm and disquiet. The
sailors imagined that they were now arrived at
the utrnoft boundary of the navigable ocean;
that these floating weeds would obflru&c their
farther progress, and concealed dangerous
rocks, or some large traa of land, which had
funk, they knew not how, in that place. Co-
lurbus endeavoured to persuade them, that
what had alarmed, ought rather to have en-
couraged them, and was to be confidered as a
sign of approaching land. At the fame time,
a brilk gale arose, and carried them forward.
Several birds were seen hovering about the

gave out that they had proceeded only five
hundred and eighty-four leagues; and, for-
tunately for Columbus, neither his own pilot,
nor those of the other ships, had tkill sufficient
to corre& this error, and discover the deceit.
They had now been above three weeks at sea;
they had proceeded far beyond what former na-
vigators had attempted or deemed poflible;
all their prognostics of discovery, drawn fromn
the flight of birds and other circumstances, had
proved fallacious; the appearances of land, wirh
which their own credulity or the artifice of their
commander had from time to time flattered andc
ainufed them, had been altogether illusive, and.
their prospect of success seemed now to be as.
distant asever. These reflections occurred often,
to men, who had no other object or occupation,
than to reason and discourse concerning the in-.
tention and circumstances of their expedition.
They made impression, at first, upon the ig-
norant and timid, and extending, by degrees,
to such as were better informed or more refo-.
lute, the contagion spread at length from ship
to ship. From secret whispers or murmur-
i1ngs, they proceeded to open cabals and public
tomplaints. They taxed their sovereign with

to the vain promises and rash conjectures of an I.
indigent foreigner, as to hazard the lives of so
many of her own subjects, in prosecuting a
chimerical scheme. They affirmed that they
had fully performed their duty, by venturing
so far in an unknown and hopeless course, and
could incur no blame for refusing to follow, any
longer, a desperate adventurer to certain de-
ftruc&ion. They contended, that it was ne.,
ceffary to think of returning to Spain, while
their crazy vessels were still in a condition to
keep the sea, but expressed their fears that the
attempt would prove vain, as the wind, which
had hitherto been so favourable to their course,
muff render it impossible to fail in the opposite
direction. All agreed' that Columbus should
be compelled by force to adopt a measure on
which their common safety depended. Some
of the more audacious proposed, as the moss
expeditious and certain method for getting rid
at once of his remonstrances, to throw him into
the tea, being persuaded that, upon their re-
turn to Spain, the death of an unsuccessful pro-
jecor would excite little concern, and be in-
quired into with no curiosity.

and saw that it was now ready to burst out into
open mutiny. He retained, however, perfect
pretence of mind. He affected to teem ig-
norant of their machinations. Notwithftand-
ing the agitation and solicitude of his own
mind, he appeared with a cheerful countenance,
like a man satisfied with the progress which he
had made, and confident of success. Some-
times he employed all the arts of insinuation to
soothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to
work upon their ambition or avarice, by mag-
nificent descriptions of the fame and wealth
which they were about to acquire. On other
occasions, he assumed a tone of authority, and
threatened them with vengeance from their so-
vereign, if, by their dastardly behaviour, they
{hould defeat this noble effort to promote the
glory of God, and to exalt the Spaniflh name
above that of every other nation. Even with
fcdikious sailors, the words of a man whom
thev had been accustomed to reverence, were
weightyv and persuasive, and not only restrained
them from those violent excesses, which they
meditated, but prevailed with them to accom-
pany their admiral for some time longer.

As

As they proceeded, the indications of ap- l6ocO r.

proaching land seemed to be more certain, and r49z.
excited hope in proportion. The birds began
to appear in flocks, making towards the south-
weft. Columbus, in imitation of the Portu-
guefe navigators, who had been guided, in fe-
veral of their discoveries, by the motion of
birds, alcered his course from due weft towards
that quarter whither they pointed their flight.
But, after holding on for several days in this
new direction, without any better success than
formerly, having seen no object, during thirty
days, but the sea and the sky, the hopes of his
companions subsided faster than they had risen;
their fears revived with additional force; im- Their fear

they af'temibled tumultuously on the deck, ex-
postulated with their commander,. mingled
threats with their expostulations, and required
him instantly to tack about and to return to'
Europe. Columbus perceived that it would be
of no avail to have recourse to any of his former
arts, which having been tried ib often, had loft
thei:r cf:ec; and that it was impossible to re-
kindle any zeal for the success of the expedition

either gentle or revere measures, to quell a mu-
tiny so general and so violent. It was necessary,
on all these accounts, to soothe passions which
he could no longer command, and to give way
to a torrent too impetuous to be checked. He
promised solemnly to his men that he would
comply with their request, provided they would
accompany him, and obey his commands for
three days longer, and if, during that times
land were not discovered, he would then aban,
don the enterprise, and direa his course towards
Spain '.

.E.n-.>- ENRAGED as the sailors were, and impatient
...ct o to turn their faces again towards their native

country, this proposition did not appear to them
unreasonable. Nor did Columbus hazard much
in confining himself to a term so short. The
presages of discovering land were now so nu-
merous and promising, that he deemed them
infallible. For some days the founding line
reached the bottom, and the foil which it
brought up indicated land to be at no great dif.
tance. The flocks of birds increased, and were

carved. The sailors aboard the Nigna took, up,
the branch of a tree with red berries, perfectly
frelh. The clouds around the setting fun.
assumed a new appearance; the air was more
mild and warm, and, during night, the wind
became unequal and variable. From all.thele
1'llmptoms, Columbus was so confident of being
near land, that on the evening of the eleventh
of O&ober, after public prayers for success, he
ordered the fails.to be furled, and the ships to
lie by, keeping strict watch, left they should be
driven ashore ip the night. During this in-
terval of fufpence and expectation, no man ihut
his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently
towards that quarter where they expected to dif-
cover the land, which had been so long the
obje&t of their wiflles.

ABOUT two hours before midnight, Colum- LanD d:co.-

bus standing on the forecastle,. observed a light ...re.
ar a distance, and privately pointed it out to
lPdro Guttierez, a page of the queen's ward-
robe. Guttierez perceived it, and calling to

place. A little after midnight, the joyful found.
of land, land: was heard from the Pinta, which
kept always ahead of the other ships. But,
having been so often deceived by fallacious ap-
pearances, every man was now become flow of
belief, and waited,, in all the anguish of uncer-
taintv and impatience, for the return of day.
r-'-.r. As soon as morning dawned, all doubts and'

fears were dispelled. From every ship an island'
was seen about two leagues to the north, whose
flat and verdant fields, well stored with wood,
and watered with many rivulets, presented the
aspect of a delightful country. The crew of
the Pinta inftarnlv began the Te Deum,- as a
hymn of thanksgiving to God, and were joined
by those of the other hfips, with tears of joy'
and transports of congratulation. This- office
of gratitude to Heaven was followed by an a&'
of justice to their commander. They threw
themselves at the feet of Columbus, with feel-
ings of felf-condemnation mingled with reve-
rence. They implored him to pardon their ig-
norance, incredulity, and insolence, which had-
-created him Go much unnecessary disquiet, and
had lb often obftrucled the prosecution of his
well-concerted plan; and passing, in the warmth5

of

of their admiration, from one extreme to BooK Ir.
another, they now pronounced the man, whom 1
they had so lately reviled and threatened, to'be
a person inspired by Heaven with sagacity and
fortitude more than human, in order to accom-
plifll a design, so far beyond the ideas and con-
ception of all former ages.

As soon as the fun arose, all their boats were FirA inter.

manned and armed. They rowed towards the thic na.tv
island with their colours displayed, with warlike
music, and other martial pomp. As they ap-
proached the coast, they saw it covered with a
multitude of people, whom the novelty of the
fpetacle had drawn together, whose attitudes
and gestures expressed wonder and astonish-
mnent at the strange objects which presented
themftelves to their view. Columbus was the
firfft European who set foot in the New World
whicil he had discovered. He landed in a rich
dre&,, and with a naked sword in his hand. His
men followed, and kneeling down, they all
ki ed the ground which they had so long desired
to ice. They next erected a crucifix, and pro-
flrarinp, themselves before it, returned thanks
to God for conduaing their voyage to such an
hsppy issue. They then took solemn poffeflion
of the country for the crown of. Castile and
Lron, with all the formalities which the Portu-

K 2 guefe

BooK IT. guele were accustomed to observe in a&ts of this

149:. kind, in their new discoveries '.

Thinr ma. THE Spaniards, while thus employed, were
tul aIo-
nim n.. surrounded by many of the natives, who gazed,

in silent admiration, upon acions which they
could not comprehend, and of which they did
not foresee the consequences. The dress of the
Spaniards, the whiteness of their skins, their
beards, their arms, appeared strange and fur-
prifing. The valf machines in which they had
traversed the ocean, that seemed to move upon
the waters with wings, and uttered a dreadful
found resembling thunder, accompanied with
lightning and smoke, struck them with such
terror, that they began to respect their new
gueffts as a superior order of beings, and con-
cluded that they were children of the Sun, who
had descended to visit the earth.

THE Europeans were hardly less amazed at

the scene now before them. Every herb, and
shrub, and tree, was different from those which
flourilhed in Europe. The foil seemed to be
rich, but bore few marks of cultivation. The
climate, even to Spaniards, felt warm, though
extremely delightful. The inhabitants appeared

naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, 'I
floited upon their shoulders, or was bound in
trcfFes around their heads. They had no beards,
and every part of their bodies was perfectly
l:nooth. Their complexion was of a dusky
copper colour, their features singular, rather
than dil agreeable, their alpe& gentle and timid.
Though not tall, they were well shaped, and
a.tive. Their faces, and several parts of their
body, were fantastically painted with glaring
colours. They were shy at first through fear,
but soon became familiar with the Spaniards,
and with transports of joy received from them
hawks-bells, glass beads, or other baubles, in
return for which they gave such provisions as
they had, and tome cotton yarn, the only com-
modity of value that they could produce. To-
wards evening, Columbus returned to his ships,
accompanied by many of the islanders in their
boats, which they called canoes, and though
rudely formed out of the trunk of a single tree,
they rowed them with surprising dexterity.
Thus, in the first interview between the inha-
bitants of the old and new worlds, every thing
w.ss conducted amicably, and to their mutual
fatisfaLtlion. The former, enlightened and am-
bitious, formed already vast ideas with refpec:
to the advantages which they might derive from

BooK II. the regions that began to open to their view.
-29». The latter, simple and undifcerning, had no

foresight of the calamities and defllation which
were approaching their country.

~

Cohin'i COLUMBUS, who now assumed the title and

aff.m& the
Utik ofd- authority of admiral and viceroy, called the
*.,ovJ island which he had discovered San Salva-

der. It is better known by the name of
Guanabani, which the natives gave to it, and is
one of that large cluster of islands called the
Lucaya or Bahama ifes. It is situated above
three thousand miles to the weft of Gomera,
from which the squadron took its departure,
and only four degrees to the south of it, so little
had Columbus deviated from the westerly course,
.which he had chosen as the most proper.
v-=X,.c-,C COLU.MBUS employved the next day in visiting

I:. ' the coats of the island; and from the universal

poverty of the inhabitants, he perceived that
this was not the rich country for which he
fought. But, conformab!v to his theory con-
cerning the di:cover, of tholc regions of Asia
which ftrec.icd cowa-ds the east, he concluded
that San Salvador was one of the isles which
geographers described as fituared in the vast
ocean adjacent to India:. Having observed

that

that most of the people whom he had seen wore BOOK I1L
inhall plates of gold, by way of ornament, in ~A
their noifrils, he eagerly inquired where they
got that precious metal. They pointed to-
wards the south, and made him comprehend
by signs, that gold abounded in countries
situated in that quarter. Thither he imme-
diately determined to dire& his course, in fall
confidence of finding there those opulent re-
gions which had beeh the obje& of his voyage,
and would be a recompence for all his toils and
dangers. He took along with him seven of the
natives of San Salvador, that, by acquiring the
Spanish language, they might serve as guides
and interpreters; and those innocent people
confidered it as a mark of distinction when they
were kle cted to accompany him.

HE saw several islands, and touched at three D'cots

of the largest, on which he bestowed the names ctub.
of St. Mary of. the Conception, Fernandina,
and Isabella. But as their foil, productions,
and inhabitants, nearly resembled those of San
Salvador, he made no stay in aiiy of them. He
inquired every where for gold, and received
uniformly for answer, that it was brought from
the south. He followed that course, and soon
discovered a country of vast extent, not per-
fectly level, like those which he had already

K 4 visited,

BooK IT. visited, but so diverilfied with rising grounds,
~,~. hills, rivers, woods, and plains, that he was

uncertain whether it might prove an island, or
part of the continent. The natives of San Sal.
vador, whom he had on board, called it Cuba;
Columbus gave it the name of Juanna. He
entered the mouth of a large river with his fqua-
dron, and all the inhabitants fled to the moun-
rains as he approached the shore. But as he
resolved to careen his ships in that places he
sent some Spaniards, together with one of the
people of San Salvador, to view the interior
parts of the country. They, having advanced
above sixty miles from the shore, reported)
upon their return, that the foil was richer and
more cultivated than any they had hitherto dif-
covered; that, besides many scattered cottages,
they had found one village, containing above a
thousand inhabitants; that the people, though
naked, seemed to be more intelligent than those
of San Salvador, but had treated them with the
fame reIpeftful attention, kissing their feet, and
honouring them as sacred beings allied to Hea-
ven; that they had given them to eat a certain
root, the taste of which resembled roasted chef-
nu:s, and likewise a singular species of corn
cailed maize, which, either when roasted whole
or ground into meal, was abundantly palatable;
that there seemed to be no four-footed animals

in

in the country, but a Species of dogs, which Boos II.
could not bark, and a creature resembling a i-r"
rabbit, but of a much smaller size; that they
had oblerved some ornaments of gold among
the people, but of no great value ".

THESE messengers had prevailed with some of His conjec.

the natives to accompany them, who informed re'gard to it
Columbus, that the gold of which they made
their ornaments was found in Cubanacan. By
this word they meant the middle or inland part
of Cuba; but Columbus, being ignorant of
their language, as well as unaccustomed to their
pronunciation, and his thoughts running con-
tinually upon his own theory concerning the
discovery of the East Indies, he was led, by the
resemblance of found, to suppose that they
spoke of the Great Khan, and imagined that
the opulent kingdom of Cathay, described by
Marco Polo, was not very remote. This in-
duced him to employ some time in viewing the
country. He visited almost every harbour,
from Purto del Principe, on the north coast of
Cuba, to the eastern extremity of the island;
but, though delighted with the beauty of the
£cenes, which every where presented themselves,

'49.^ both which, from their novelty, made a more

lively imprefflon upon his imagination', he did
not find gold in such quantity as was sufficient
to satisfy either the avarice of his followers, or
the expectations of the court to which he was to
return. The people of the country, as much
astonished at his eagerness in quest of gold, as
the Europeans were at their ignorance and fim-
plicity, pointed towards the east, where an
island which they called Hayti was situated, in
which that metal was more abundant than
among them. Columbus ordered his squadron
to bend its course thither; but Martin Alonfo
Pinzon, impatient to be the first who should
take poffiefion of the treasures which this coun-
try was supposed to contain, quitted his com-
panions, regardless of all the admiral's signals
to flacken fail until they should come up with
him.

D;c.t-!. COLUMBUS, retarded by contrary winds, did

plo-ed ; and it is the only country, of those he

had yet difeovered, which has retained the name Boo II.
that he gave it. As he could neither meet with ,49,.
the Pinta, nor have any intercourse with the in-
habitants, who fled in great consternation to-
wards the woods, he soon quitted St. Nicholas,
and iuiling along the northern coast of the
island, he entered another harbour, which he
called Conception. Here he was more for-
tunate; his people overtook a woman who was
flying from them, and after treating her with
great gentlenets, dismissed her with a present
of such tays as they knew were most valued in
those regions. The description which she gave
to her countrymen of the humianity and won-
derful qualities of the strangers; their admira-
tion of the trinkets, which she thewed with
exultation; and their eagerness to participate
of the fame favours; removed all their fears,
and induced many of them to repair to the har-
bour. The strange objects which they beheld,
and the baubles which Columbus bestowed
upon them, amply gratified their curiosity and
their \vifhes. They nearly resembled the peo-
ple of Guanahani and Cuba. They were naked
like rhem, ignorant, and simple; and seemed
to be equally unacquainted with all the arts
which appear most neceliary in polished focie-
ties; but they were gentle, credulous, and ti-
mid, to a degree which rendered it easy to ac-

u-..,-- their exceflive admiration led them into the

fame error with the people of the other islands,
in believing the Spaniards to be more than
mortals, and descended immediately from
Heaven. They possessed gold in greater abun-
dance than their neighbours, which they readily
exchanged for bells, beads, or pins; and, in
this unequal traffic, both parties were highly
ple aed, each confidering themselves as gainers
by the tranfastion. Here Columbus was visited

rogate all the natives with whom he had any BooK II.
intercourse concerning their situation. They ,77.
concurred in pointing out a mountainous
country, which they called Cibao, at some
distance from the Ita, and farther towards the
east. Struck with this found, which appeared
to him the fame with Cipango, the name by
which Marco Polo, and other travellers to the
east, diltinguifhed the islands of Japan, he no
longer doubted with refpe&f to the vicinity of
the countries which he had discovered to the
remote parts of Asia; and, in full expectation
of reaching soon those regions which had been
the object of his voyage, he directed his course
towards the east. He put into a commodious
harbour, which he called St. Thomas, and
found that diftri&t to be under the government
of a powerful cazique, named Guacanahari,
who, as he afterwards learned, was one of the
five sovereigns among whom the whole island
was divided. He immediately tent messengers
to Columbus, who, in his name, delivered to
him the present of a mask curiously fashioned,
v.ith the ears, nose, and mouth of beaten gold,
and invited him to the place of his residence,
near the harbour now called Cape Francois,
1bme leagues towards the east. Columbus dif-
patched fame of his officers to visit this prince,
who, as he behaved himself with greater dig-

nity,

Boo IT. nitv, seemed to claim more attention. They

. returned, with such favourable accounts both

of the country and of th. penple, as made
Columbus impatient for that interview with
Guacanahari to which he had been invited.
On: of his HE fAiled for this purpose from St. Thomas,

on the twenty-fourth of December, with a fair
wind, and the sea perfectly calm; and as,
amidit the multiplicity of his occupations, he
had not shut his eyes for two days, he retired
at midnight, in order to take iome repose, hav-
ing committed the helm to the pilot, with
frc; injunctions not to quit it fur a moment.
The pilot, dreading no danger, carelessly left
the helm to an unexperienced cabin-boy, and
the ship, carried away by a current, was dashed
aza ,:!-. a rock. The violence of the shock
awakened Columbus. He ran up to the deck.
There, all was confusion and despair. He
alene retained presence of mind. He ordered
fc:r.e of the sailors to take a boat, and carry
c.'t ,n anchor astern; but, instead of obeying,
they made ors towards the Nigna, which was
about half a league distant. He then com-
manded the masts to be cut down, in order to
lighten the ship; but all his endeavours were
too laze; the vefiel opened near the keel, and
f-l!ed so fast with water, that its loss was in-

3 evitable.

evitable. The smoothness of the sea, and the Book If.
timely afliftance of boats from the Nigna, 49*
enabled the crew to save their lives. As soon
as the islanders heard of this disaster, they
crowded to the shore, with their prince Gua-
canahari at their head. Instead of taking ad-
vantage of the distress in which they beheld
the Spaniards, to attempt any thing to their
detriment, they lamented their misfortune with
tears of sincere condolance. Not satisfied with
this unavailing expression of their sympathy,
they put to sea a vast number of canoes, and,
under the direction of the Spaniards, assisted
in saving whatever could be got out of the
wreck; and, by the united labour of so many
hands, almost every thing of value was carried
ashore. As fast as the goods were landed,
Guacanahari in person took charge of them.
By his orders, they were all deposited in one
place, and armed centinels were posted, who
kept the multitude at a distance, in order to
prevent them not only from embezzling, but
from inpe&cting too curiously what belonged
to their gueftsz. .Next morning this prince
visited Columbus, who was now on board the
Nigna, and endeavoured to console him for
his loss, by offering all that he possessed to
repair ic'.

TH£

BooK II. THE condition of Columbus was such, that
't.,,, he stood in need of contolation. He had
ncld- ,s hitherto procured no intelligence of the Pinta,

and no longer doubted but that his treacherous
associate had set fail for Europe, in order to
have the merit of carrying the first tidings of
the extraordinary discoveries which had been
made, and to pre-occupy so far the ear of their
sovereign, as to rob him of the glory and
reward to which he was justly intitled. There
remained but one vessel, and that the fmialleft
and most crazy of the squadron, to traverse
such a vast ocean, and carry so many men
back to Europe. Each of thole circumstances
was alarming, and filled the mind of Columbus
with the utmofi solicitude. The desire of over-
t-king Pinzon, and of effacing the unfavour-
able impresisons which his misrepresentations
might make in Spain, made it necessary to

R-oli to return thither without delay. The difficulty

o.- ..r.. of taking such a number of persons aboard the
...-i..r... Nigna, confirned him in an opinion, which

the fertility of the country, and the gentle
temper of the people, had already induced
him to form. He reollved to leave a part of
his :-c'.v in the illand, that, by residing there,
thl. im!!r learn the language of the natives,
fL:J,. t:..ir dLih.:'rion, examin:e the nature of
the cour.:..', :--' rc r mines, prepare for the

cormmo-

commodious settlement of the colony, with BooK II.
which he purposed to return, and thus secure 42,.
and facilitate the acquisition of those advan-
tages which he expected from his discoveries.
When he mentioned this to his men, all ap-
proved of the design; and from impatience
under the fatigue of a long voyage, from the
levity natural to tailors, or from the hopes of
amassing vast wealth in a country which afforded
such promising specimens of its riches, many
offered voluntarily to be among the number of
those who ffiould remain.

NOTHINC was now wanting towards the exe- obtains the

sent of Guacanahari; and his unfufpicious fim-
plicity soon presented to the admiral a favour-
able opportunity of proposing it. Columbus
having, in the best manner he could, by
broken words and signs, expressed some curio-
fity to know the cause which had moved the
islanders to fly with such precipitation upon ~
the approach of his ships, the cazique informed
him that the country was much infested by
the incursions of certain people, whom he called
Carribeans, who inhabited several islands to the
south east. These he described as a fierce and
warlike race of men, who delighted in blood,
and devoured the flesh of the prisoners who

VoL. I. L were

BooK II. were so unhappy as to fall into their hands;

and as the Spaniards, at their first appearance,
were supposed to be Carribeans, whom the
natives, however numerous, durst not face in
battle, they had recourse to their usual method
of securing their safety, by flying into the
thickest and most impenetrable woods. Gua-
canahari, while speaking of those dreadful in-
vaders, discovered such symptoms of terror,
as well as such consciousness of the inability
of his own people to resist them, as led Colum-
bu, to conclude that he would not be alarmed
at the proposition of any scheme which afforded
him the profpeclt of an additional security
against their attacks. He instantly offered him
the assistance of the Spaniards to repel his
enemies; he engaged to take him and his
people under the protection of the powerful
monarch whom he served, and offered to leave
in the island such a number of his men, as
should be sufficient, not only to defend the
inhabitants from future incursions, but to
avenge their past wrongs.
Boi;i Ia THE credulous prince closed eagerly with

the proposal, and thought himself already safe
under the patronage of beings sprung from
Heaven, and superior in power to mortal men.
The ground was marked out for a finall fort,

5 which

which Columbus called Navidad, because he BOOK II.
had landed there on Christmas day. A deep x,_
ditch was drawn around it. The ramparts
were fortified with pallifades, and the great
guns, saved out of the admiral's ship, were
planted upon them. In ten days the work
was finished; that simple race of men labour-
ing with inconsiderate assiduity in erecing this
firll monument of their own lirvitude. During
this time Columbus, by his caresses and libe-
ralitv, laboured to increase the high opinion
which the natives entertained of the Spaniards.
But while he endeavoured to inspire them with
confidence in their disposition to do good, he
wished likewise to give them some striking
idea of their power to punish and destroy such
as were the objects of their indignation. With
this view, in pretence of a vast assembly, he
drew up his men in order of battle, and made
an ostentatious but innocent dilplay of the
sharpness of the Spanish swords, of the force
of their spears, and the operation of their
cross-bows. These rude people, firangers to
the use of iron, and unacquainted with any
hostile weapons, but arrows of reeds pointed
with the bones of fishes, wooden swords, and
javelins hardened in the fire, wondered and
trembled. Before this surprise or fear had
time to abate, he ordered the great guns to be

L 2 fired.

BeoK II. fired. The sudden explosion struck them with
'~'g such terror, that they fell flat to the ground,

covering their faces with their hands; and
when they beheld the astonishing effect of the
bullets among the trees, towards which the
cannon had been pointed, they concluded that
it was impossible to resist men, who had the
command of such destructive inffruments, and
who came armed with thunder and lightning
againfti their enemies.

H; i.;,:nc- AFTER giving such imprefflons both of the.
rcn, *o
:h.V i..:': beneficence and power of the Spaniards, as

might have rendered it easy to preserve an
ascendant over the minds of the natives, Co-
lumbus appointed thirty-eight of his people
to remain in the island. He entrusted the
command of these to Diego de Arada, a gen-
tleman of Cordova, investing him with the
fame powers which he himself had received
from Ferdinand and Isabella; and furnished
him with every thing requisite for the sub-
filfence or defence of this infant colony. He
i".rctll enjoined them to maintain concord
among themselves, to yield an unreserved obe-
d:.ence to their commander, to avoid giving
otence to the natives by any violence or
exa c:on, to cultivate the friendship of Gua-
canahar:, but not to put themselves in his

power

power by straggling in fiall parties, or march- BOOK IL
ing too far from the fort. He promised to ,;,.
revisit them soon, with such a reinforcement
of strength as might enable them to take full
poffiefion of the country, and to reap all the
fruits of their discoveries. In the mean time,
he engaged to mention their names to the king
and queen, and to place their merit and services
in the most advantageous light b.

HAVING thus taken every precaution for the

security of the Colony, he left Navidad on the
fourth of January, one thousand four hundred 49}.
and ninety-three, and fleering towards the
eafl, discovered, and gave names to most of
the harbours on the northern coast of the island.
On the sixth, he descried the Pinta, and soon
came up with her, after a reparation of more
than fix weeks. Pinzon endeavoured to justify
his conduct, by pretending that he had been
driven from his course by stress of weather,
and prevented from returning by contrary
winds. The admiral, though he frill fufpeaed
his perfidious intentions, and knew well what
he urged in his own defence to be frivolous as
well as false, was so sensible that this was not
a proper time for venturing upon any hig'h

,49. in this junction with his consort, which deli-

vered him froin many disquieting apprehen,
fiens, that lame as Pinzon's apology was, he
admitted of it without difficulty, and restored
him to favour. During his absence from the
admiral, Pinzon had visited several harbours
in the island, had acquired some gold by
tra:ffcking with the natives, but had made no

rev. an :o
E-a-:-. the temper of his men, Columbus now found

it neceffarn, to haften his return to Europe.
The former, having suffered much during a
voyage of such an unusual length, were ex-
tremely leaky. The latter expressed the utmost
impatience to revisit their native country, from
which they had been so long absent, and where
they had things so wonderful and unheard-of
to relate. Accordingly, on the sixteenth of
January, he directed his course towards the
north-east, and soon loft fight of land. He
had on board some of the natives, whom he
had taken from the different islands which he
discovered; and besides the gold, which was
the chief object of research, he had collected
specimens of all the productions which were
likely to become subjects of commerce in the

might attra&c the attention of the learned, or
excite the wonder of the people. The voyage
was prosperous to the fourteenth of February,
and he had advanced near five hundred leagues
across the Atlantic Ocean, when the wind A violent
began to rife, and continued to blow with
increasing rage, which terminated in a furious
hurricane. Every expedient that the naval
Skill and experience of Columbus could devifc
was employed, in order to save the ships. But
it was impossible to withstand the violence of
the florm, and as they were still far from any
land, deftru&ion seemed inevitable. The
sailors had recourse to prayers to Almighty
God, to the invocation of faints, to vows and
charms, to every thing that religion difates,
or fuperflition suggests, to the affrighted mind
of man. No prospect of deliverance appearing,
they abandoned themselves to despair, and ex-
peaed every moment to be swallowed up in
the waves. Betides the passions which natu-
rally agitate and alarm the human mind in
such awful situations, when certain death, in
one of his most terrible forms, is before it,
Columbus had to endure feelings of distress
peculiar to himself. He dreaded that all The nn-

his schemes, and his own name would descend
to posterity as that of a rash deluded adven-
turer, infsead of being tranfinitted with the
honour due to the author and conductor of the
mol. noble enterprise that had ever been under-
taken. These refections extinguished all sense
of his own personal danger. Less affected
wit: t'e loss of life, than solicitous to preserve
th}e memory of what he had attempted and
achieved, he retired to his cabbin, and wrote,
upon parchment, a short account of the voyage
l.hich he had made, of the course which he
iad taken, of the situation and riches of the
co':;.-tries which he had discovered, and of the
colony that he had left there. Having wrapt
up this in an oiled cloth, which he inclosed in
a cake of wax, he put it into a cask carefully
i'.;pped up, and threw it into the sea, in hopes
t'.-at ome fortunate accident might preserve a
siDpeot of so much importance to the world'.

panions discovered land; and though uncer-
tain what it was, they made towards it. They
soon knew it to be St. Mary, one of the Azores
or western isles, fubje& to the crown of Por-
tugal. There, after a violent contest with the
governor, in which Columbus displayed no
less spirit than prudence, he obtained a supply
of fresh provisions, and whatever else he needed.
One circumstance, however, greatly disquieted
him. The Pinta, of which he had loft fight
on the first day of the hurricane, did not ap-
pear; he dreaded for some time that She had
foundered at sea, and that all her crew had
perished: afterwards, his former suspicions re-
curred, and he became apprehensive that Pin-
zon had borne away for Spain, that he might
reach it before him, and, by giving the first
account of his discoveries, might obtain some
share of his fame.

IN order to prevent this, he left the Azores ve.,4.

which it was natural for the Portuguese to feel,
when they beheld another nation entering upon
that province of discovery which they had
hitherto deemed peculiarly their own, and in
its first essay, not only rivalling but eclipsing
their fame, Columbus was received with all the
marks of distinction due to a man who had
performed things so extraordinary and unex-
pected. The king admitted him into his pre-
fence, treated him with the highest refpec:,
and liltened to the account which he gave of
his voyage with admiration mingled with re-
gret. While Columbus, on his part, enjoyed
the fatisfacion of describing the importance
of his discoveries, and of being now able to
prove the solidity of his schemes to those very
persons, who, with an ignorance disgraceful to
themselves, and fatal to their country, had
lately rejected thein as the projects of a visionary
or designing adventurer d.

COLUMBUS was so impatient to return to

from the time when he set out thence upon his 1493
voyage. As soon as his ship was discovered
approaching the port, all the inhabitants of
Palos ran eagerly to the shore, in order to
welcome their relations and fellow-citizens,
and to hear tidings of their voyage. When
the prosperous issue of it was known, when
they beheld the strange people, the unknown
animals, and singular productions brought from
the countries which had been discovered, the
efiiufion of joy was general and unbounded.
The bells were rung, the cannon fired3 Co-
lumbus was received at landing with royal
honours, and all the people, in solemn pro-
cefion, accompanied him and his crew to the
church, where they returned thanks to Heaven,
which had so wonderfully conducted and crown-
ed with success, a voyage of greater length
and of more importance, than had been at-
tempted in any former age. On the evening
of the fame day, he had the fatisfaation of
feeing the Pinta, which the violence of the
tempcft had driven far to the north, enter the
harbour.

THE first care of Columbus was to inform H;srecep.

the king and queen, who were then at Barce- 'ion.
lona, of his arrival and success. Ferdinand

and

Boor II. and Isabella, no less astonished than delighted

with this unexpected event, desired Columbus,
in terms the most refpecful and flattering, to
repair immediately to court, that from his own
mouth, they might receive a full detail of his
extraordinary services and discoveries. During
his journey to Barcelona, the people crowded
from the adjacent country, following him every
where with admiration and applause. His en-
trance into the city was conducted, by order
of Ferdinand and Isabella, with pomp suitable
to the great event, which added such diftin-
guifhing lustre to their reign. The people
whom he brought along with him from the
countries which he had discovered, marched
firll, and by their singular complexion, the
wild peculiarity of their features, an uncouth
finery, appeared like men of another species.
Next to them were carried the ornaments of
gold, faihioned by the rude art of the natives,
the grains of gold found in the mountains, and
dull of the fame metal gathered in the rivers.
After these appeared the various commodities
of the new discovered countries, together with
-h.er 'rious productions. Columbus himself
closed i:.; ' Tion, and attraated the eyes of
all the fpectarors, who gazed with admiration
on the extraordinary man, whose superior saga-
city and fortitude had conducted their country-

and Isabella received him clad in their royal
robes, and feated upon a throne, under a mag-
nificent canopy. When he approached they
flood up, and raising him as he kneeled to kifs
their hands, commanded him to take his feat
upon a chair prepared for him, and to give a
circumstantial account of his voyage. He de-
livered it with a gravity and composure no
less suitable to the disposition of the Spanish
nation, than to the dignity of the audience in
which he spoke, and with that modest fimpli-
city which charaferifes men of superior minds;
who, satisfied with having performed great
actions, court not vain applause by an oftenta-
tious display of their exploits. When he had
finilhed his narration, the king and queen,
kneeling down, offered up solemn thanks to
Almighty God for the discovery of those new
regions, from which they expected so many
advantages to flow in upon the kingdoms sub-
jedt to their government '. Every mark of
honour that gratitude or admiration could fug-
gest was conferred upon Columbus. Letters
patent were issued, confirming to him and to
his heirs all the privileges contained in the

was ennobled; the king and queen, and, after
their example, the courtiers, treated him, on
every occasion, with all the ceremonious refpea&
paid to persons of the highelt rank. But what
pleated him most, as it gratified his active
mind, bent continually upon great objects, was
an order to equip, without delay, an arma-
ment of such force, as might enable him not
only to take possession of the countries which
he had already discovered, but to go in search
of those more opulent regions, which he still
confidently expected to find '.

_Ado-r.- \WHILE preparations were making for this

ral attention. The multitude, struck with
amazement when they heard that a new world
had been found, could hardly believe an event
so much above their conception. Men of
science, capable of comprehending the nature,
and of discerning the effects, of this great dif-
covery, received the account of it with admi-
ration and joy. They spoke of his voyage
with rapture, and congratulated one another

period when, by this extraordinary event, the BooK II.
boundaries of human knowledge were so much '-.'
extended, and such a new field of inquiry and
observation opened, as would lead mankind to
a perse& acquaintance with the firu&ure and
productions of the habitable globe e. Various
opinions and conjectures were formed concern-
ing the new-found countries, and what divi-
sion of the earth they belonged to. Columbus
adhered tenaciously to his original opinion,
that they should be reckoned a part of those
vast regions in Asia, comprehended under the
general name of India. This sentiment was
confirmed by the observations which he made
concerning the producions of the countries he
had discovered. Gold was known to abound
in India, and he had met with such promising
samples of it in the islands which he visited, as
led him to believe that rich mines of it might
be found. Cotton, another produ&ion of the
East Indies, was common there. The pimento
of the islands he imagined to be a species of
the Eaft-Indian pepper. He mistook a root,
Somewhat resembling rhubarb, for that valu-
able drug, which was then supposed to be a
plant peculiar to the East Indies h. The birds
brought home by him were adorned with the

appeared to be the fame with the crocodile

stances, not only the Spaniards, but the other
nations of Europe, seem to have adopted the
opinion of Columbus. The countries which
he had discovered were confidered as a part of
India. In consequence of this notion, the
name of Indies is given to them by Ferdinand
and Isabella, in a ratification of their former
agreement, which was granted to Columbus
upon his return . Even after the error which

niards. Though little accustomed to naval BOOK I.
expeditions, they were impatient to set out ,9.
upon the voyage. Volunteers of every rank
solicited to be employed. Allured by the vast
prospects which opened to their ambition and
avarice, neither the length nor danger of the
navigation intimidated them. Cautious as Ser-
dinand was, and averse to every thing new or
adventurous, he seems to have catched the
fame spirit with his fubje&ts. Under its in-
fluence, preparations for a second expedition
were carried on with a rapidity unusual in
Spain, and to an extent that would be deemed
not inconsiderable in the present age. The
fleet consisted of seventeen ships, some of which
were of good burden. It had on board fifteen
hundred persons, among whom were many of
noble families, who had served in honourable
stations. The greater part of there being
destined to remain in the country, were fur-
nifhcd with every thing requisite for conquest
or settlement, with all kinds of European do-
meftic animals, with such feeds and plants as
were most likely to thrive in the climate of the
Welt Indies, with utensils and instruments of
every fort, and with such artificers as might be
most useful in an infant colonyk.

o their title to the poffe(fion of the newly-difco-

'': -~' vered countries upon its operations alone. The
ó,t-=y - example of the Portusuefe, as well as the

f..' iperifition of the age, made it necessary to
obtain from the Roman pontiff a grant of those
territories which they wished to occupy. The
Pope, as the vicar and representative of Jesus
Chrifft, was supposed to have a right of domi-
nion over all the kingdoms of the earth.
Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every
cimne which disgraces humanity, filled the
papal throne at that time. As he was born
Ferdinand's fubjeEt, and very solicitous to
cecure the protection of Spain, in order to
facilitate the execution of his ambitious schemes
in favour of his own family, he was extremely
wvllinr, to gratify the Spanifl- monarchs. By
an a&c of liberality which cost him nothing,
a-.d that served to efablifh the jurisdic'tion and
.-ezenfions of the papal fee, he granted in
s'.i right to Ferdinand and Isabella all the
o..'.: ries inhabited by Infidels, which they had
d!.:covercd, or fhouid discover; and, in virtue
Gi t;'?.: power which he dcri;ed from Jesus

vast reg.tn, to the poffeiion of which he hiim-
seif was so f.r from having any t.ice, thiat he

was unacquainted with their situation, 'and Box It.
ignorant even of their existence. As it was 149.
necessary to prevent this grant from interfering
with that formerly made to the crown of Por-
tugal, he appointed that a line, supposed to
be drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues
to the westward of the Azores, should serve
as the limit between them; and, in the pleni-
tude of his power, bestowed all to the eafl of
this imaginary line upon the Portuguese, and
all to the wefl of it upon the Spaniards m. Zeal
for propagating the Christian faith was the
consideration employed by Ferdinand in solicit-
ing this bull, and is mentioned by Alexander
as his chief motive for issuing it. In order
to manifest some concern for this laudable ob-
ject, several friars, under the direction of
Father Boyl, a Catalonian monk of great repu-
tation, as apoftolical vicar, were appointed to
accompany Columbus, and to devote them-
fclves to the instruction of the natives. The
Indians whom Columbus had brought along
with him, having received some tincture of
Christian knowledge, were baptized with much
iolcmnity, the king himself, the prince his son,
and the chief persons of his court, fHanding as
their godfathers. Those first fruits of the New

i~osco- quired a ride, which was then deemed corm-

pletely valid, to extend their discoveries, and
to establish their dominion over such a vast por-
tion of the globe, nothing now retarded the
departure of the fleet. Columbus was ex-
tremely impatient to revisit the colony which
he had left, and to pursue that career of glory
upon which he had entered. He set fail from
the bay of Cadiz on the twenty-fifth of Sep-
tember, and touching again at the island of
Gomera, he freered farther towards the south
than in his former voyage. By holding this
course, he enjoyed more steadily the benefit of
the regular winds, which reign within the tro-
pics, and was carried towards a large cluster of
iiands, situated considerably to the east of those
w! ;ch he had already discovered. On the
x .v. vtwentv-fixth day after his departure from Go-

r-era, he made land '. It was one of the Ca-
r.!Sbe or Leeward ifiands, to which he gave the

World. After this he visited successively Do- Boor II.
minica, Marigalante, Guadalupe, Antigua, San 3493.
Juan de Puerto Rico, and several other islands,
scattered in his way as he advanced towards the
north-west. All these he found to be inhabited
by that fierce race of people whom Guacanahari
had painted in such frightful colours. His
descriptions appeared not to have been exagge-
rated. The Spaniards never attempted to land
without meeting with such a reception, as dif-
covered the martial and daring spirit of the na-
tives; and in their habitations were found re-
lics of those horrid feasts which they had made
upon the bodies of their enemies taken in war.

BUT as Columbus was eager to know the state Arre,.... at

of the colony which he had planted, and to sup- Nov. z.
ply it with the necessaries of which he supposed
it to be in want, he made no flay in any of those
islands, and proceeded directly to Hispaniola°.
When he arrived off Navidad, the Ifation in
which he had left the thirty-eight men under
the command of Arada, he was aftonilhed that
none of them appeared, and expected every
moment to fee them running with transports of
joy to welcome their countrymen. Full of so-

Boor It. licitude about their fafert, and foreboding in
i,.- r his mind what had befallen them, he'rowed in-

ftantlv to land. All the natives from whom he
might have received information had fled. But
the fort which he had built was entirely de-
molifhed, and the tattered garments, the broken
arms and utensils scattered about it, left no room
to doubt concerning the unhappy fate of the
garrison P. While the Spaniards were shedding
rears over those fad memorials of their fellow-
citizens, a brother of the cazique Guacanahari

T-e tf-: c: arrived. From him Columbus received a par-
ron h ticular detail of what had happened after his

departure from the island. The familiar in-
tercourfe of the Indians with the Spaniards
tended gradually to diminish the superstitious
veneration with which their first appearance had
ir.fpired that simple people. By their own in-
dilcretion and ill conduct, the Spaniards speedily
effaced those favourable imprefflons, and soon
convinced the natives, that they had all the
wants, and weaknesses, and passions of men.
As soon as the powerful restraint which the
pretence and authority of Columbus imposed
was withdrawn, the garrison threw off all re-
gard for the officer whom he had invested with
command. Regardless of the prudent inftruc-

tions

tions which he had given them, every man be- Boor IL
came independent, and gratified his desires 1-9.
without controul. The gold, the women, the
provisions of the natives, were all the prey of
those licentious oppressors. They roamed in
small parties over the island, extending their
rapacity and insolence to every corner of it.
Gentle and timid as the people were, those un-
provoked injuries at length exhausted their pa-
tience, and rouzed their courage. The cazique
of Cibao, whole country the Spaniards chiefly
infested on account of the gold which it con-
tained, surprised and cut off several of them,
while they ifraggled in as perse& security as if
their conduct had been altogether inoffensive.
He then assembled his subjects, and surrounding
the fort, set it on fire. Some of the Spaniards
were killed in defending it, the reft periflied in
attempting to make their efcape.by crossing an
arm of the sea. Guacanahari, whom all their
exactions had not alienated from the Spaniards,
took arms in their behalf, and, in endeavouring
to protect them, had received a wound, by
which he was frill confined q.

proper juncture for inquiring into his conduct
with scrupulous accuracy, that he rejected the
advice of several of his officers, who urged him
to seize the person of that prince, and to revenge
the death of their countrymen by attacking his
subje&s. He represented to them the necefiity
of securing the friendship of some potentate of
the country, in order to facilitate the settlement
which they intended, and the danger of driving
the natives to unite in some desperate attempt
against them, by such an ill-timed and unavail-
ing exercise of rigour. Instead of wafting his
time in punishing past wrongs, he took precau-
tions for preventing any future injury. With
this view, he made choice of a situation more
healthy and commodious than that of Navidad.
He traced out the plan of a town in a large plain
near a spacious bay, and obliging every person
to put his hand to a work on which their com-
mon safety depended, the houses and ramparts
were soon so far advanced by their united la-
bour, as to afford them Afelter and security.
This rising city, the first that the Europeans
founded in the New World, he named Ifa-

infant colonies are exposed when they fettle in lowers.
an uncultivated country, but he had to contend
with what was more insuperable, the laziness,
the impatience, and mutinous disposition of his
followers. By the enervating influence of a hot
climate, the natural inactivity of the Spaniards
seemed to increase. Many of them were gen-
tlemen, unaccustomed to the fatigue of bodily
labour, and all had engaged in the enterprise
with the sanguine hopes excited by the splendid
and exaggerated descriptions of their country,
men who returned from the first voyage, or by
the mistaken opinion of Columbus, that the
country which he had discovered was either the
Cipango of Marco Polo, or the Ophir', from
which Solomon imported those precious com-
modities which suddenly diffused such extraor-
dinary riches through his kingdom. But when,
instead of that golden harvest which they
had expe&ed to reap without toil or pains, the
Spaniards saw that their profpef of wealth was
remote as well as uncertain, and that it could
not be attained but by the flow and persevering
efforts of industry, the Adifappointment of those

chimerical

Boor II. chimerical hopes occasioned such dejection of
'v - mind as bordered on despair, and led to general

discontent. In vain did Columbus endeavour
to revive their spirits by pointing out the ferti-
lity of the foil, and exhibiting the specimens of
gold daily brought in from different parts of the
island. They had not patience to wait for the
gradual returns which the former might yield,
and the latter they despised as scanty and incon-
fiderable. The spirit of disaffection spread,
and a conspiracy was formed, which might have
been fatal to Columbus and the colony. Hap-
pily he discovered it, and seizing the ring_
leaders, punished some of them, sent others
prisoners into Spain, whither he dispatched
twelve of the ships which had served as tranf-
ports, with an earned request for a reinforce-
ment of men and a large supply of provisions .

,= . MEANWHILE, in order to banish that idle-
~'°"''s ness which, by allowing his people leisure to
r' .' '-: brood over their disappointment, nourished the

spirit of discontent, Columbus planned several
expeditions into the interior part of the country.
He sent a detachment, under the command of
Alonfo de Ojeda, a vigilant and enterprising
officer, to visit the diftriEt of Cibao, which was

said to yield the greatest quantity of gold, and BooK IL
followed him it person with-the main body of 494
his troops. In this expedition, he displayed all March z.
the pomp of military magnificence that he could
exhibit, in order to strike the imagination of
the natives. He marched with colours flying,
with martial music, and with a finall body of
cavalry that paraded Sometimes in the front and
sometimes in the rear. As those were the first
horses which appeared in the New World, they
were objefts of terror no less than of admiration
to the Indians, who having no tame animals
themselves, were unacquainted with that vast
accession of power, which man hath acquired
by fubjecing them to his dominion. They
supposed them to be rational creatures. They
imagined that the horse and the rider formed
one animal, with whose speed they were afto-
nifhed, and whole impetuosity and strength they
confidered as irresistible. But while Columbus
endeavoured to inspire the natives with a dread
of his power, he did not neglect the arts of
gaining their love and confidence. He adhered
scrupulously to the principles of integrity and
justice in all his tranfaftions with them, and
treated them, on every occasion, not only with
humanity, but with indulgence. The district
of Cibao answered the description given of it by
the natives. It was mountainous and unculti-

vated,

Booc JI. vated, but in every river and brook gold was

;,4 gathered either in duff or in grains, fomer of

which were of considerable size. The Indians
had never opened any mines in search of gold.
To penetrate into the bowels of the earth, and
to refine the rude ore, were operations too com-
piicated for their talents and industry, and they
lad no such high value for gold as to put their
ingenuit and invention upon the stretch in
order to obtain it °. The frall quantity of that
p.-ccous metal which they possessed, was either
pilced up in the beds of the rivers, or walhed
from the mountains by the heavy rains that fall
within the tropics. But, from those indica-
tions, the Spaniards could no longer doubt that
the country contained rich treasures in its
bowels, of which they hoped soon to be masters-.
In order to secure the command of this va-
luable province, Columbus erected a small
fort, to which he gave the name of St. Thomas,
bv way of ridicule upon some of his incredulous
followers, who would not believe that the coun-
try produced gold, until they saw it with their
own eyes, and touched it with their hands'.

of wealth in the country of Cibao came very ,494.
seasonably to comfort the desponding colony, .hdmds,
which was affected with distresses of various tion of the

colony in-

kinds. The fRock of provisions which had been crcaf.-
brought from Europe was moftlv consumed;
what remained was so much corrupted by the
heat and moisture of the climate, as to be almost
unfit for use; the natives cultivated so small a
portion of ground, and with so little skill, that
it hardly yielded what was sufficient for their
own subsistence; the Spaniards at Isabella had
hitherto neither time nor leisure to clear the foil,
so as to reap any considerable fruits of their own
industry. On all these accounts, they became
afraid of perishing with hunger, and were re-
duced already to a scanty allowance. At the
fame time, the diseases predominant in the tor-
rid zone, and which rage chiefly in those un-
cultivated countries, where the hand of industry
has not opened the woods, drained 'the marfies,
and confined the rivers within a certain chan-
nel, began to spread among them. Alarmed
at the violence and unusual symptoms of those
maladies, they exclaimed against Columbus and
his companions in the former voyage, who, by
their splendid but deceitful descriptions of His-
paniola, had allured them to quit Spain for a
barb.,rous uncultivated land, where they mutt

either

BooK IT. either be cut off by famine, or die of unknown
'^^.^ distempers. Several of the officers and persons

of note, instead of checking, joined in those
seditious complaints. Father Boyl, the apofto-
lical vicar, was one of the most turbulent and
outrageous. It required all the authority and
address of Columbus to re-eftablilh fubordina-
tion and tranquillity in the colony. Threats
and promnifes were alternately employed for this
purpose; but nothing contributed more to
ftoth the malcontents than the profpec: of find-
ing, in the mines of Cibao, such a rich store of
treasure as would be a recompence for all their
fuffcrings, and efface the memory of former
dilfappointments.

c- - 'WHEN, bv his unwearied endeavours, con-
}[.' ' cord and order were so far restored, that he
T..; ... could venture to leave the island, Columbus re-

therto unvificed. He appointed his brother

different parts of the island, and endeavour to
establish the authority of the Spaniards among
the inhabitants. Having left them very parti-
cular inftru&ions with refpeft to their condu&,
he weighed anchor on the 24th of April, with
one ship and two small barks under his com-
mand. During a tedious voyage of full five
months, he had a trial of almost all the nume-
rous hardships to which persons of his profeflion
are exposed, without making any discovery of
importance, except the island of Jamaica. As
he ranged along the southern coast of CubaY ,
he was entangled in a labyrinth formed by an
incredible number of finall islands, to which he
gave the name of the Queen's Garden. In this
unknown course, among rocks and shelves, he
was retarded by contrary winds, assaulted with
furious storms, and alarmed with the terrible
thunder and lightning which is often almost in-
ceffant between the tropics. At length his pro-
visions fell short; his crew, exhausted with
fatigue as well as hunger, murmured and
threatened, and were ready to proceed to the
most desperate extremities against him. Beset
with danger in such various forms, he was
obliged to keep continual watch, to observe

To these the squadron owed its fafery. But this

on a feverish disorder, which terminated in a

way of France. At Paris he received an ac-

brother had made in his first voyage, and that

he was then preparing to embark on a second B9oc II.
expedition. Though this naturally induced 4,9
him to pursue his journey with the utmost dif-
patch, the Admiral had failed for Hispaniola
before he reached Spain. Ferdinand and Ifa-
bella received him with the refpe& due to the
nearest kinsman of a person whose merit and
services rendered him so conspicuous; and as
they knew what consolation his pretence would
afford to his brother, they persuaded him to
take the command of three ships, which they
had appointed to carry provisions to the colony

now brought from Europe, afforded a tem-

ties of famine, the supply was not in such quan-
tity as to Yupport them long, and the island did
not hitherto yield what was sufficient for their
sustenance. They were threatened with another
danger, still more formidable than the return
of scarcity, and which demanded more imme-.

soldiers under Margarita, as if they had been
set free from discipline and subordination,
scorned all reitraint. Instead of-conforming to
the prudent instructions of Columbus, they dif-
perfed in itraggling parties over the island,
lived at discretion upon the natives, wafted
their provisions, seized their women, and treated
that inoffensive race of men with all the info-
lence of military oppression '.

As long as the Indians had any prospect that

their sufferings might come to a period by the
voluntary departure of the invaders, they sub-
mitted in silence, and dissembled their sorrow;
but they now perceived that the yoke would be
as permanent as it was intolerable. The Spa-
niards had built a town, and surrounded it with
ramparts. They had erected forts in different
places. They had enclosed and sown several
fields. It was apparent that they came not to
· fir the country, but to fettle in it. Though
the number of those firangers was inconfider-
able, the state of cultivation among this rude
people was so imperfect, and in such exact pro-
portion to their own consumption, that it was

with difficulty they could afford subsistence to BooK II,
their new guests. Their own mode of life was ,: 4,
lb indolent and inactive, the warmth of the cli-
mate so enervating, the conftitutionr of their
bodies naturally so feeble, and so unaccustomed
to the laborious exertions of idrduftry, that'
they were satisfied with a proportion of food
amazingly fmrall. A handful of maize, or a
little of the insipid bread made of the caffaida-
root, was sufficient to support men, whose
strength and lpirits were not exhauftedtlby ahy
vigorous efforts either of body or mind. 'The
Spaniards, though the most abstemious of all
the European nations, appeared to them ex-

order to avert the deftruc&ion with which they
were threatened, either by the flow consumption
of. famine, or by the violence of their op-
pressors, it was necessary t' assume courage,
to attack those formidable invaders with united
force, and drive them from the settlements of
which they had violently taken possession.
'Wiri, h SucH were the fentiiments which universally

prevailed among the Indians, when Columbus
returned to Isabella. Inflamed by the unpro-
voked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree
of rage of which their gentle natures, formed
to susser and fubmir, seemed hardly susceptible,
they waited only for a signal from their leaders
to fall upon the colony. Some of the caziques
had already surprised and cut off several ftrag-
glers. The dread of this impending danger
united the Spaniards, and re-established the
authority of Columbus, as they saw no profpeft
of safety but in committing themselves to his
prudent guidance. It was now necessary to
have recourse to arms, the employing of which
against the Indians, Columbus had hitherto
'avoided with the greatest solicitude. Unequal
?s the confliE may seem, between the naked
inhabitants of the New World, armed with

swords, and arrows pointed with bones or flints; x494.
and troops accustomed to the discipline, and
provided with the instruments of deftrustion
known in the European art of war, the situation
of the Spaniards was far from being exempt
from danger. The vast superiority of the na-
tives in number, compensated many defects.
An handful of men was about to encounter a
whole nation. One adverse event, or even any
unforeseen delay in determining the fate of the
war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards. Con-
fcious that success depended on the vigour and
rapidity of his operations, Columbus instantly
assembled his forces. They were reduced to a
very fi-nall number. Diseases, engendered by
the warmth and humidity of the country, had
raged among them with much violence; expe-
rience had not yet taught them the art either of
curing there, or the precautions requisite for
guarding against them; two-thirds of the ori-
ginal adventurers were dead, and many of those
who survived were incapable offervice'. The Ma4ch .
body which took the field consisted only of two
hundred foot, twenty horse, and twenty large
dogs; and how strange soever it may seem, to
mention the last as composing part of a mili-

ployed against naked and timid Indians. All
the caziques of the island, Guacanahari ex-
cepted, who retained an inviolable attachment
to the Spaniards, were in arms to oppose Co-
lumbus, with forces amounting, if we may be-
lieve the Spanish historians, to a hundred thou-
sand men. Instead of attempting to draw the
Spaniards in:o the fastnesses of the woods and
mountains, they were so imprudent as to take
their iation in the Vega Real, the most open
plain in the country. Columbus did not allow
t.tem time to perceive their error, or to alter
their position. He attacked them during the
night, when unrdifciplined troops are least ca-
pable of acting with union and concert, and
obtained an easy and bloodless victory. The
conflernation with which the Indians were filled
by the noise and havoc made by the fire-arms,
by the impetuous force of the cavalry, and the
fierce onset of the dogs, was so great, that they
threw down their weapons, and fled without at-
tempting resistance. Many were slain; more

contending with aggressors whom they deemed 14,5.

COLUMBUS employed several months in A ti .m-.

marching through the iflland, and in fubjelting ohcem.1
it to the Spanish government, without meeting
with any opposition. He imposed a tribute
upon all the inhabitants above the age of four-
teen. Each person who lived in those districts
where gold was found, was obliged to pay quar-
terly as much gold dust as filled a hawk's bell;
from those in other parts of the country, twenty-
five pounds of cotton were demanded. This
was the firfl regular taxation of the Indians, and
served as a precedent for exactions still more
intolerable. Such an imposition was extremely
contrary to those maxims which Columbus had
hitherto inculcated with refpe&t to the mode of
treating them. But intrigues were carrying on
in the court of Spain at this juncture, in order
to undermine his power and discredit his opera-
tions, which constrained him to depart from his
own system of administration. Several unfa-
vourable accounts of his conduct, as well as of
the countries discovered by him, had been
tranfinitted to Spain. Margarita and Father
Boyl were now at court; and in order to justify
their own conduct, or to gratify their resent-

N 4 ment,

Boor r. ment, watched with malevolent attention for

14.5. every oppurrunity of spreading insinuations to

his detriment. Many of the courtiers viewed
his growing reputation and power with envious
eyes. Fonieca, the archdeacon of Seville, who
was intrusted with the chief direction of Indian
affairs, had conceived filch an unfavourable opi-
nion of Columbus, for some reason which the
contemporary writers have not mentioned, that
he listened with partiality to every invective
against him. It was not easy for an unfriended
stranger, unpractised in courtly arts, to coun-
teract the machinations of so many enemies.
Columbus saw that there was but one method
of Supporting his own credit, and of silencing
all his adversaries. He must produce such a
quantity of gold, as would not only justify
what he had reported with respect to the rich-
ness of the country, but encourage Ferdinand
and Isabella to persevere in prosecuting his
plans. The neceffitv of obtaining it, forced
him not onl;' to impose this heavy tax upon the
Indians, but to exact payment of it with extreme
rigour; and may be pleaded in excuse for his
deviating on this occasion from the mildness and
huirranity with which he uniformly treated that
unhappy people'.

THE

THE. labour, attention, and foresight which BooK IL

the Indians were obliged to employ in procuring 1-495
the tribute demanded of them, appeared the Frtallfdead
mofl intolerable of all evils, to men accustomed ,ta,
to pats their days in a careless, improvident
indolence. They were incapable of such a re-
gular and persevering exertion of industry, and
felt it such a grievous restraint upon their li-
berty, that they had recourse to an expedient
for obtaining deliverance from this yoke, which
demonstrates the excess of their impatience and
despair. They formed a scheme of starving
those oppressors whom they durst not attempt to
expel; and from the opinion which they enter-
tained with refpeft to the voracious appetite of
the Spaniards, they concluded the execution of
it to be very practicable. With this view, they
suspended all the operations of agriculture;
they Iowed no maize, they pulled up the roots
of the manioc which were planted, and retiring
to the most inacceflible parts of the mountains,
left the uncultivated plains to their enemies.
This desperate resolution produced in some de-
gree the effects which they expected. The
Spaniards were reduced to extreme want; but
they received such seasonable supplies of provi-
sions from Europe, and found so many re-
sources in their own ingenuity and industry,
that they suffered no great loss of men. The

wretched

Boor II. wretched Indians were the vi&ims of their own

1495. ill-concerted policy. A vast multitude, shut

up among barren mountains, without any food
but the spontaneous productions of the earth,
soon felt the utmost distresses of famine. This
brought on contagious diseases; and, in the
course of a few months, more than a third part
of the inhabitants of the island perished, after
experiencing misery in all its various forms '.
ir.tri-. BUT while Columbus was thus successfully

bagun in establishing the foundations of the Spanish gran-
s. .t' of deur in the New World, his enemies laboured

with unwearied assiduity to deprive him of the
glory and rewards, which by his services and
sufferings he was intitled to enjoy. The hard-
mhips unavoidable in a new settlement, the ca-
lamities occasioned by an unhealthy climate,
the disasters attending a voyage in unknown
seas, were all represented as the fruits of his
restless and inconsiderate ambition. His pru-
dent attention to preserve discipline and fubor-
dinarion was denominated excess of rigour; the
punishments which he inflicted upon the muti-
nous and disorderly were imputed to cruelty.
These accusations gained such credit in a jealous

court, that a commiflioner was appointed to re- BooK I4s
pair to Hispaniola, and to infpe&t into the con- -
dua of Columbus. By the recommendation
of his enemies, Aguado, a groom of the bed-
chamber, was the person to whom this import-
ant trust was committed. But in this choice
they ieem to have been more influenced by the
obsequious attachment of the man to their in-
rereft, than by his capacity for the station.
Puffed up with such sudden elevation, Aguado
displayed, in the exercise of this office, all the.
frivolous felf-importance, and acted with all
the disgusting insolence, which are natural to
little minds, when raised to unexpected dignity,
or employed in functions to which they are not
equal. By listening with eagerness to every
accusation against Columbus, and encouraging
not only the malcontent Spaniards, but even
the Indians, to produce their grievances, real
or imaginary, he fomented the spirit of diffen-
tion in the island, without establishing any re-
gulation of public utility, or that tended to re-
drels the many wrongs, with the odium o~f
which he wished to load the admiral's admini-
ftration. As Columbus felt sensibly how humi-
liating his situation must be, if he should re-
main in the country while such a partial in-
spector observed his motions, and controuled
his jurifdiaion, he took the resolution of re-

turning

,g. of all his tranfafions, particularly with respect

to the points in dispute between him and his
adversaries, before Ferdinand and Isabella, from
whose justice and discernment he expected an
equal and a favourable decision. He com-
mitted the administration of affairs, during his
106. absence, to Don Bartholomew, his brother,

with the title of Adelantado, or Lieutenant-
Governor. By a choice less fortunate, and
which proved the source of many calamities to
the colony, he appointed Francis Roldan chief
justice, with very extensive powers s.

Retru to IN returning to Europe, Columbus held a
5x' course different from that which he had taken

in his former voyage. He steered almost due
cast from Hispaniola, in the parallel of twenty-
two degrees of latitude; as experience had not
yet discovered the more certain and expeditious
method of stretching to the north, in order to
fall in with the south-west winds. By this ill-
advised choice, which, in the infancy of navi-
gation between the New and Old Worlds, can
hardly be imputed to the admiral as a defect in
naval skill, he was exposed to infinite fatigue
and danger, in a perpetual struggle with the

trade-

trade-winds, which blow without-variation from BooK 11.
the east between the tropics. Notwithstanding 1496.
the almnoft insuperable difficulties of such a na-
vigation, he persisted in his course -with his
usual patience and firmness, but made so little
way, that he was three months without feeing
land. At length, his provifionsbegan to fail,
the crew was reduced to the scanty allowance of
fix ounces of bread a-day for each person. The
admiral fared no better than the meanest tailor.
But, even in this extreme distress, he retained
the humanity which distinguishes his character,
and refused to comply with the earnest folicita-
tions of his crew, some of whom proposed to
feed upon the Indian priso'ners whom they were
carrying over, and others insisted to throw
them over-board, in order to lessen the con-
fumption of their small stock. He represented,
that they were human beings, reduced by a
common calamity to the fame condition with
themselves, and intitled to share an equal fate,
His authority and remonstrances dillipated those
wild ideas suggested by despair. Nor had they
time to recur, as he came soon within fight of
the coast of Spain, when all their fears and sus-
ferings ended '.

COLUMBUS

BOOK II. COLUMBUS appeared at court with the modest

-w-6. but determined confidence of a man confcidus
H ..t.t. not only of integrity, but of having performed

great services. Ferdinand and Isabella, ashamed
of their own facility in lending too favourable
an ear to frivolous or ill-founded accusations,
received him with such diflinguifhed marks of
refpeat, as covered his enemies with shame.
Their censures and calumnies were no more
heard of at that junhture. The gold, the pearls,
the cotton, and other commodities of value
which Columbus produced, seemed fully to
refute what the malcontents had propagated
with refpeft to the poverty of the country. By
reducing the Indians to obedience, and imposing
a regular tax upon them, he had secured to
Spain a large accession of new subjects, and the
establishment of a revenue that promised to be
considerable. By the mines which he had found
out and examined, a source of wealth still more
copious was opened. Great and unexpected as
those advantages were, Columbus represented
them only as preludes to future acquisitions,
and as the earnest of more important difcoveriesi
which he flill meditated, and to which those he
had already made would condu& him with ease
and certainty v.

THE attentive consideration of all these cir- Bool II.

cumftances made such impression, not only -496.
upon Isabella, who was flattered with the idea Api for
of being the patroness of all Columbus's enter- the morere

prises, but even upon Ferdinand, who having gblihmentof
originally expressed his disapprobation of his acolony.
schemes, was still apt to doubt of their success,
that they resolved to supply the colony in His-'
paniola with every thing which could render it
a permanent establishment, and to furnish Co-
lumbus with such a fleet, that he might proceed
to search for those new countries, of whose
existence he seemed to be confident. The
measures most proper for accomplishing both;
these designs were concerted with Columbus.'
Discovery had been the sole object of the si-ft'
voyage to the New World; and though, in tShe:
second, settlement had been proposed, the pre-
cautions taken for that pyrpofe had either been.
insufficient, or were rendered ineffec&ual by the:
mutinous spirit of the Spaniards, and the mn-
foreseen calamities arising from various, causes.
Now a plan was to be formed of a regular cbo
lony, that might serve as a model in all future
establishments. Every particular was confidered-
with attention, and the whole arranged with as
scrupulous accuracy. The precise number of
adventurers who should be permitted to embark
was fixed. They were to be of different ranks

2 and

BooK II. and professions; and the proportion of each was

D. established, according to their usefulness and

the wants of the colony. A suitable number of
women was to be choisn to accompany these
new settlers. As it was the first obje& to raise
provisions in a country where scarcity of food
had been the occasion of so much distress, a
considerable body of husbandmen was to be
carried over. As the Spaniards had then no
conception of deriving any benefit from those
produ&ions of the New World which have since
yielded such large returns of wealth to Europe,
but had formed magnificent ideas, and enter-
tained sanguine hopes with refpe&t to the riches
contained in the mines which had been disco-
vered, a band of workmen, skilled in the va-
rious arts employed in digging and refining the
precious metals, was provided. All these emi-
grants were to receive pay and subsistence for
some years, at the public expence k.
A dfeeamD THus far the regulations were prudent, and

well adapted to the end in view. But as it was
foreseen that few would engage voluntarily to
fettle in a country, whose noxious climate had
-been fatal to so many of their countrymen, Co-
lumbus proposed to transport to Hispaniola

crimes, which, though capital, were of a less 1456.
atrocious nature; and that for the future a
certain proportion of the offenders usually sent
to the gallies, ihould be condemned to labour
in the mines which were to be opened. This
advice, given without due reflection, was as
inconsiderately adopted. The prisons of Spain
were drained, in order to collec members for
the intended colony; and the judges were in-
lrucrted to recruit it by their future sentences.
It is not, however, with such materials, that
the foundations of a society, deffined to be
permanent, should be laid. Indultry, sobriety,
patience, and mutual confidence are indifpen-
fably requisite in an infant settlement, where
purity of morals muff contribute more towards
eflablilhing order, than the operation or autho-
rity of laws. But when such a mixture of
what is corrupt is admitted into the original
constitution of the political body, the vices of
tholi unsound and incurable members will-pro-
bably infeat the whole, and must certainly be
productive of violent and unhappy effects.
This the Spaniards fatally experienced; and
the other European nations having filcceffively
imitated the practice of Spain in this p.arti-
cular, pernicious consequences have' followed

s'~":7 facilit. and dispatch, the royal approbation of

every measure and regulation that he proposed,
his endeavours to carry them into execution
were lo long retarded, as must have tired our
the patience of any man, less accustomed to
encounter and to surmount difficulties. Those
delavs were occasioned partly by that tedious
ibrmality and spirit of procrastination, with
which the Spaniards conduct business; and
partly by the exhausted state of the treasury,

tiuted to the malicious arts of Columbus's
enemies. AtLonifhed at the reception which

his prelence, they gave way, for tome time, to
a tide of favour too strong for them to oppose.

operations, and by the assistance of Fonseca, the ,496.
minister for Indian affairs, who was now pro-
moted to the bishopric of Badajos, they threw
in so many obstacles to protract the prepara-
tions for Columbus's expedition, that a year
elapfied before he could procure two ships to
carry over a part of the supplies destined for

The voyage which he now meditated was in a

As he was fully persuaded that the fertile
regions of India lay to the south-west of those
countries which he had discovered, he pro-
posed, as the most certain method of finding
out these, to stand directly south from the
Canary or Cape de Verd islands, until he came
under the equinoctial line, and then to stretch
to the weft before the favourable wind for such
a course, which blows invariably between the
tropics. With this idea he set fail, and touched May 30.

of the Orinoco. This, though a river only of the
third or fourth magnitude in the New World,
far surpasses any of the itreams in our hemi-
sphere. It rolls towards the ocean such a vast

Drago. As soon as the consternation which
this occasioned permitted him to refle& upon
the nature of an appearance so extraordinary,
he discerned in it a source of comfort and
hope. He juvJ concluded, that such a vast
body of water as this river contained, could
not be supplied by any island, but must flow
through a country of immenle extent, and of
coniequence, that he was now arrived at that
continent which it had long been the object
of his wilhes to discover. Iull of this idea,
he stood to the well along the coast of those
provinces which are now known by the names
of Paria and Cumana. He landed in several
pl-ces, and had some intercourse with the
people, who refemblid those of Hispaniola in
their appearance and manner of life. They
wore, as ornaments, finall plates of gold, and
pearls of considerable value, which they wil-
lingly exchanged for European toys. They
seemed to possess a better underfianding, and
greater courage, than the inhabitants of the
islands. The country produced four-footed
ar.nimals of several kinds, as well as a great
var.:--: of fowls and fruits '. The admiral was

so much delighted with its beauty and fertility, BooK IT.
that with the warm enthusiasm of a discoverer, ,~
he imagined it to be the paradise described in
Scripture, which the Almighty chose for the
residence of man, 'while he retained innocence
that rendered him worthy of such a habitation '.
Thus Columbus had the glory not only of dif-
covering to mankind the existence of a New
World, but made considerable progress towards
a perfect knowledge of it; and was the first
man who conducted the Spaniards to that vast
continent which has been the chief feat of their
empire, and the source of their treasures in
this quarter of the globe. The shattered con-
dition of his ships, scarcity of provisions, his
own infirmities, together with the impatience
of his crew, prevented him from pursuing his
discoveries any farther, and made it necessary
to bear away for Hispaniola. In his way
thither he discovered the islands of Cubagua
and Margarita, which afterwards became re-
markable for their pearl-fifhery. When he Aug. 30.
arrived at Hispaniola, he was wafted to an
extreme degree with fatigue and fickneifs but
found the affairs of the colony in such a situation,
as afforded him no profpe0: of enjoying that'
repose of which he flood so much in need.

Boor II. MANY revolutions had happened in that

4 :, country during his absence. His brother, the
stat- fHiR- adelantado, in consequence of an advice which

..a..- the admiral gave before his departure, had

removed the colony from Isabella to a more
commodious ifation, on the opposite fide of
the island, and laid the foundation of St. Do-
mingo ", which was long the moif considerable
Europt an town in the New World, and the
feat ors the supreme courts in the Spanish domi-
nions there. As soon as the Spaniards were
el'ablilhed in this new Settlement, the adelan-
raJo, that they might neither languifll in in-
a:iv:;--, nor have lcifure to form new cabals,
marched in:o those parts of the island which
his brother had not vet visited or reduced to
obedience. As the people were unable to re-
sift, thev submitted every where to the tribute
which he imposed. But they soon found the
burden to be so intolerable, that, overawed as
they were by the superior power of their op-
pr. Tors, they took arms against them. Those
ir,;urrcctions, however, were not formidable.
A confli-t with timid and naked Indians was
r.c!:ner dangerous nor of doubtful issue.

aspect

afpecl far more alarming, broke out among Boor II.
the Spaniards. The ringleader of it was Francis ,^.
Roldan, whom Columbus had placed in a
station which required him to be the guardian
of order and tranquillity in the colony. A
turbulent and inconsiderate ambition precipi-
tated him into this desperate measure, so un-
becoming his rank. The arguments which he
employed to seduce his countrymen were frivo-
lous and ill-founded. He accused Columbus
and his two brothers of arrogance and feve-
rity; he pretended that they aimed at establish-
ing an independent dominion in the country;
he taxed them with an intention of cutting off
part of the Spaniards by hunger and fatigue,
that they might more easily reduce the re-
mainder to subjection; he represented it as un-
worthy of Castilians, to remain the tame and
passive slaves of three Genoese adventurers.
As men have always a propensity to impute
the hardships of which they feel the pressure,
to the misconduct of their rulers; as every
nation views with a jealous eye the power and
exaltation of foreigners, Roldan's insinuations
nmidc a deep impression on his countrymen.
Hlis charaOter and rank added weight to them.
A considerable number of the Spaniards made
choice of him as their leader, and taking arms
against the adelantado and his brother, seized

the

Boors I. the king's magazine of provisions, and endea-
t_.. voured to surprise the fort at St. Domingo.

This was preserved by the vigilance and courage
of Don Diego Columbus. The mutineers
were obliged to retire to the province of Xara-
gua, where they continued not only to disclaim
the adelantado's authority themselves, but ex-
cited the Indians to throw off the yoke w

was astonished to find that the three ships which
he had dispatched from the Canaries were not

and the violence of currents, they had been
carried a hundred and sixty miles to the weft
of St. Domingo, and forced to take shelter in
a harbour of the province of Xaragua, where
Roldan and his seditious followers were can-
toned. Roldan carefully concealed from the
commanders of the ships his infurreation against
the adelantado, and employing his utmost ad-
drcfs to gain their confidence, persuaded them
to set on Ihore a considerable part of the new
citrlers whom they brought over, that they
Fright proceed by land to St. Domingo. It
required but few arguments to prevail with

his demands. Columbus, though filled with
resentment at his ingratitude, and highly exaf-
perated by the insolence of his followers, made
no haste to take the field. He trembled at
the thoughts of kindling the flames of a civil
war, in which, whatever party prevailed, the
power and strength of both mufft be so much
wafted, as might encourage the common enemy
to unite and complete their deilruftion. At

take arms, had so far infected those who fRill
adhered to him, that many of them were ad-
verie, and all cold to the service. From such
sentiments, with refpe&t to the public interest,
as well as from this view of his own situation,
he chose to negociare rather than to fight. By
a seasonable proclamation, offering free pardon
to such as should merit it by returning to
their duty, he made impression upon fume of
the malcontents. By engaging to grant such
as should desire it the liberty of returning to
Spain, he allured all those unfortunate adven-
turers, who, from sickness and disappointment,
were disgusted with the country. By pro-
mifing to re-efablifh Roldan in his former
oG.ce, he soothed his pride; and by complying
with mofo of his demands in behalf of his
followers, he satisfied their avarice. Thus,
gradually and without bloodshed, but after
mainy tedious negociations, he dissolved this
dangerous combination which threatened the
colony with ruin; and restored the appear-
ance of order, regular government, and tran-

substituted in place of the tribute formerly
imposed; and how necessary soever such a
regulation might be in a sickly and feeble
colony, it introduced among the Spaniards the
Repartimientos, or distributions of Indians efta-
blifhed by them in all their settlements, which
brought numberless calamities upon that un-
happy people, and fubje&ted them to the mofl:
grievous oppression . This was not the only
bad effect of the infurreftion in Hispaniola; it
prevented Columbus from prosecuting his dif-
coveries on the continent, as felf-prefervation
obliged him to keep near his person his brother
the adelantado, and the sailors whom he in-
tended to have employed in that service. As
soon as his affairs would permit, he sent some
of his Ihips to Spain with a journal of the
voyage which he had made, a description of
the new countries which he had discovered, a
chiart of the coast along which he had failed,
and specimens of the gold, the pearls, and

Boog II. other curious or valuable productions which he
1.9. had acquired by trafficking with the natives.

At the fame time he tranf;nitted an account of
the infurreEtion in Hispaniola; he accused the
mutineers not only of having thrown the colony
into such violent convulsions as threatened its
dissolution, but of having obstructed every
attempt towards discovery and improvement,
by their unprovoked rebellion against their
superiors, and proposed several regulations for
the better government of the island, as well as
the extinction of that mutinous spirit, which,
though suppressed at present, might soon burst
out with additional rage. Roldan and his afro-
ciates did not neglect to convey to Spain, by
the fame ships, an apology for their own con-
duct, together with their recriminations upon
the admiral and his brothers. Unfortunately
for the honour of Spain, and the happiness
of Columbus, the latter gained most credit in
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella, and pro-
duced unexpected effects'.

lumbus was engaged in his fucceflive voyages BooKr I
to the weft, the spirit of discovery did not ,*s9
languish in Portugal, the kingdom where it
first acquired vigour, and became enterprising.
Self-condemnation and regret were not the
only sentiments to which the success of Co-
lumbus, and reflection upon their own impru-
dence in rejecting his proposals, gave rife
among the Portuguese. They excited a gene-
rous emulation to surpass his performances, and
an ardent desire to make some reparation to
their country for their own error. With this
view, Emmanuel, who inherited the enter-
prifing genius of his predecessors, persisted in
their grand scheme of opening a passage to the
East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope; and
soon after his accession to the throne, equipped
a iquadron for that important voyage. He
gave the command of it to Vasco de Gama, a
man of noble birth, possessed of virtue, pru-
dence, and courage, equal to the Itation. The
hlquadron, like all those fitted out for discovery
in the infancy of navigation, was extremely
fecble, confifling only of three vef!](i:, of
ncichcr- burden nor force adequate to the ler-
vici. As the Europeans were at that time

zg. rofume seasons easy, and at others not only dan-

gerous, but almost impracticable, the time
chosen for Gama's departure was the most im-
proper during the whole year. He set fail
1497. from Lisbon on the ninth of July, and stand-

ing towards the south, had to struggle for four
months with contrary winds, before he could
a.. .a. reach the Cape of Good Hope. Here their

violence began to abate; and during an in-
terval of calmn weather, Gama doubled that
formidable promontory, which had so long
been the boundary of navigation, and d !re"ted
his courie towards the norch-eaft, alung the
African coast. He touched at several ports;
and after various adventures, which the Por-
tuguefe hilforians relate with high but just
encomiums upon his conduct and intrepidity,
he came to anchor before the city of Melinda.
Throughout all the valt countries which extend
along the coalt of Africa, from the river Sene-
gal to the confines of Zanguebar, the Portu-
guefe had found a race of men rude and un-
cuitivated, strangers to letters, to arts and
commerce, and differing from the inhabitants
cf Europe no lets in their features and conm-
plexion, than in their manners and institutions.
As thev a.'.v.:-ced from this, they observed, to

features began to predominate, marks of civi- ,
lization appeared, letters were known, the
Mahometan religion was established, and a
commerce, far from being inconsiderable, was
carried on. At that time several vessels from
India were in the port of Melinda. Gama
now pursued his voyage with almost absolute
certainty of success, and, under the condu&t
of a Mahometan pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon
the coast of Malabar, on the twenty-fecond
of May one thousand four hundred and ninety-
eight. What he beheld of the wealth, the
populousness, the cultivation, the industry and
arts of this highly civilized country, far fur-
passed any idea that he had formed, from the
imperfect accounts which the Europeans had
hitherto received of it. But as he possessed
neither sufficient force to attempt a settlement,
nor proper commodities with which he could
carry on commerce of any consequence, he
haflened back to Portugal, with an account of
his success in performing a voyage the longest,
as well as most difficult, that had ever been
made since the first invention of navigation.
Hle landed at Lisbon on the fourteenth of Sep-
tember one thousand four hundred and ninety-
nine, two years two months and five days from
the time he left that port .

VOL. I. P THUS,

Bonx ir. THu-s, during the course of the fifteenth

g century, mankind made greater progress in

exploring the state of the habitable globe, than
in all the ages which had elapsed previous to
that period. The fpiric of discovery, feeble
at first and cautious, moved within a very
narrow sphere, and made its efforts with hefi-
tation and timidity. Encouraged by success,
it became adventurous, and boldly extended
its operations. In the course of its progression,
it continued to acquire vigour, and advanced
at length with a rapidity and force which burst
through all the limits within which ignorance
and fear had hitherto circumscribed the ac&ivity
of the human race. Almost fifty years were
employed by the Portuguese in creeping along
the coast of Africa from Cape Non to Cape de
Verd, the latter of which lies only twelve
degrees to the south of the former. In less
than thirty years they ventured beyond the
equinoctial line into another hemisphere, and
penetrated to the southern extremity of Africa,
at the diRtance of forty-nine degrees from Cape
de Verd. During the last seven years of the
century, a New World was discovered in the
weft, not inferior in extent to all the parts of
the earth with which mankind were at that
rime acquainted. In the east, unknown seas
and countries were found out, and a commu-

nication,

nication, long desired, but hitherto concealed, BooK II.
was opened between Europe and the opulent 1499.
regions of India. In comparison with events
so wonderful and unexpected, all that had
hitherto been deemed great or splendid, faded
away and disappeared. Vafl obje&s now pre-
sented themselves. The human mind, rouzed
and interested by the profpe&, engaged with
ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its active
powers in a new direction.

THIS spirit of enterprise, though but newly Diroweres

carried on in

awakened in Spain, began soon to operate ex- Spain by
tenfively. All the attempts towards discovery pijet.'d-
made in that kingdom, had hitherto been car-
ried on by Columbus alone, and at the ex-
pence of the sovereign. But now private ad.
venturers, allured by the magnificent defcrip-
tions he gave of the regions which he had
visited, as well as by the specimens of their
wealth which he produced, offered to fit out
squadrons at their own risk, and to go in quefl
of new countries. The Spanish court, whose
scanty revenues were exhausted by the charge
of its expeditions to the New World, which,
though they opened valt profpeas of future
benefit, yielded a very sparing return of present
profit, was extremely willing to devolve the
burden of discovery upon its subjects. It seized

- success with respect to themselves. One of the

first propositions of this kind was made by
Alonib de Qjeda, a gallant and active officer,
who had accompanied Columbus in his second
vov age. His rank and character procured him
fu-h credit with the merchants of Seville, that
thev undertook to equip four ships, provided
he could obtain the royal licence, authorising
the voyage. The powerful patronage of the
bi:top of Bada"os easily secured success in a
':t .' b agreeable to the court. Without con-
1!:'.ing Columl'us, or regarding the rights and
.:'-iluicaion v.-':c' he had acquired by the capi-
tulation in one thousand four hundred and
nintf-tswo, Oie.a .was permitted to set out for
the New W\orld. In order to direct his course,
the cb:nop com;rnu.icated to him the admiral's
.}o rnal of his 1Ift voyage, and his charts of
Ma». the counr.ries w^.ch he had discovered. Ojeda

forut::k o'l;t ino no new path of navigation, but
adc:ering iervilelv to the route which Columbus
had ta!^en, arrived on the coast of Paria. He
traded with the natives, and htanding to the
welf, proceeded as far as Cape de Vela, and
ranged along a considerable extent of coast

beyond

beyond that on which Columbus had touched. BooK II.
Having thus ascertained the opinion of Co- z49.
lumbus, that this country was a part of the
continent, Ojeda returned by way of Hispaniola oaobcr.
to Spain, with some reputation as a ditcoverer,
but with little benefit to those who had railed
the funds for the expedition '.

AMERIGO VESPucCI, a Florentine gentle- is accompa-

man, accompanied Ojeda in this voyage. In 'ib
what station he served, is uncertain ; but as he VdqcI-
was an experienced tailor, and eminently skilful
in all the Iciences subservient to navigation, he
teems to have acquired such authority among
his companions, that they willingly allowed
him to have a chief share in directing their
operations during the voyage. Soon after his
return, he tranfinitted an account of his ad-
ventures and discoveries to one of his country-
men; and labouring with the vanity of a
traveller to magnify his own exploits, he had
the address and confidence to frame his narra-
tive, so as to make it appear that he had the
glory of having first discovered the continent
in the New \orld. Ainerigo's account was
drawn up not only with art, but with some
elegance. It contained an amnifing hiflory of
his voyage, and j]ldicious obl;rvatiolns upol

visited. As it was the first description of any
part of the New World that was published, a
performance so well calculated to gratify the
passion of mankind for what is new and mar-
vellous, circulated rapidly, and was read with

Froho= admiration. The country of which Amerigo
the narre or
Ar.a i; was supposed to be the discoverer, came gra-
i:,wcr.. dually to be called by his name. The caprice

of mankind, often as unaccountable as unjust,
has perpetuated this error. By the universal
content of nations, AMx:ERICA is the name be-
flowed on this new quarter of the globe. The
bold prezenlions o. a fortunate impostor have
robbed the discoverer of the New World of a
diftincion which belonged to him. The name
of Amnerigo has tfpplaiited that of Columbus;
and mankind may regret an aft of injustice,
which, having received the sanction of time,
it is now too late to redress .

This voyage seems to have been conducted
with greater attention to private emolument,
than to any general or national object. Nigno
and Guerra made no discoveries of any import-
ance; but they brought home such a return of

Book II. DURING the last year of the fifteenth cen-

l $oo tury, that fertile diftri& of America, on the
Tee ,d:'o confines of which Pinzon had iLopt short, was

'tB.iii-. more fully discovered. The successful voyage

of Gama to the East Indies having encouraged
the king of Portugal to fit out a fleet so power-
ful, as not only to carry on trade, but to
attempt conquelf, he gave the command of it
to Pedro Alvarez Cabral. In order to avoid
the coast of Africa, where he was certain of
meeting with variable breezes, or frequent
cairnlms, which micht retard his voyage, Cabral
itoo1 ouit to lea, and kept so far to the weft,
that, to his furpri!, he found himfclf upon
the fimure o( an unknown country, in the tenth
degree bevynd th} line. He imagined, at first,
that it was lbmc idland in the Atlantic ocean
hitherto unoblerved; but, proceeding along
i-s coast for several days, he was led gradually
to believe, that a country so extensive formed
a part of tome great continent. This latter
opinion was well founded. The countrv with
which he fell in belongs to that province in
South America now known by the name of
Bra'l. lHe landed; and having formed a very
hi nh 'i-a of the fertility of the ibil, and agree-

the New World was the effort of an active
genius, enlightened by science, guided by ex-
perience, and acting upon a regular plan, exe-
cuted with no less courage than perseverance.
But from this adventure of the Portuguese, it
appears that chance might have accomplished
that great design, which it is now tie pride of
human reason to have formed and perfected.
If the sagacity of Columbus had not condu&ed
mankind to America, Cabral, by a fortunate
accident, might have led them, a few years
later, to the knowledge of that extensive con-

out of the island. Several of the malcontents
continued in arms, refuning to submit to the
admiral. He and his brothers were obliged
to take the field alternately, in order to check
their incursions, or to punish their crimes.
The perpetual occupation and disquiet which
this created, prevented him from giving due
attention to the dangerous machinations of his
enemies in the court of Spain. A good number
of such as were mofi dif'atisfied with his admi-
niftration, h.id embraced the opportunity of
returning to Europe with the ships which he
di;iarched from St. Domingo. The final dif-
appDintmen.t of all their hopes inflamed the
rage of thele unfortunate adventurers against
Columbus to the utmof: pitch. Their poverty
and diftrels, by exciting compaiTion, rendered
their accu.ations credible, and their complaints

the derail of their own gr:evarces, and the
articlcs uof their charge againrf Columbus.
lWhenever either the king or queen appeared

and demanding vengeance upon the author of Booc II.
their sufferings. They insulted the admiral's ,
sons wherever they met them, reproaching
them as the offspring of the projector, whose
fatal curiosity had discovered those pernicious
regions which drained Spain of its wealth, and
would prove the grave of its people. These
avowed endeavours of the malcontents from
America to ruin Columbus, were seconded by
the secret, but more dangerous insinuations of
that party among the courtiers, which had
always thwarted his schemes, and envied his
success and credit h.

FERDINAND was disposed to liften, not only Therin.

with a willing, but with a partial ear, to these Ferdiana,

accounts which Columbus had given of the
riches of America, the remittances from it

ceived in return for the efforts which she had
made. But time had already diminished the

Boor II. New World occasioned, and fame alone was
1So:. not an object to satisfy the cold interested mind

of Ferdinand. The nature of commerce was
then so little understood, that, where imme-
diate gain was not acquired, the hope of distant
benefit, or of flow and moderate returns,
was totally disregarded. Ferdinand confidered
Spain, on this account, as having loft by the
enterprile of Columbus, and imputed it to his
milcondu& and incapacity for government, that
a country abounding in gold had yielded no-
thing of value to its conquerors. Even Ifa-
bella, who, from the favourable opinion which
ihe entertained of Columbus, had uniformly
prote&ed him, was shaken at length by the
number and boldness of his accusers, and began
to suspect that a disaffection so general must
havc been occasioned by real grievances, which
called for redress. The bishop of Badajos,
wirth his usual animosity against Columbus,
encouraged these suspicions, and confirmed
them.

F. ;: .5:a, As loon as the queen began to give way to
"s x" uthe torrent of calumny, a resolution fatal to

Columbus was taken. Francis de Bovadilla,
a knight of Calatrava, was appointed to repair
to HiiDaniola, with full powers to inquire into
tn: ccnduft of Columbus, and, if he should

find

find the charge of mal-administration proved, BooK II.
to supersede him, and assume the government ,.
of the island. It was impossible to escape con-
demnation, when this preposterous commission
made it the interest of the judge to pronounce
the person whom he -was sent to try, guilty.
Though Columbus had now composed all the
dissentions in the island; though he had brought
both Spaniards and Indians to submit peace-
ably to his government; though he had made
such effectual provision for working the mines,
and cultivating the country, as would have
secured a considerable revenue to the king, as
well as large profits to individuals, Bovadilla,
without deigning to attend to the nature or
merit of those services, discovered, from the
moment that he landed in Hlifpaniola, a deter-
mined purpose of treating him as a criminal.
He took possession of the admiral's house in
St. Domingo, from which its matter happened
at that time to be absent, and seized his effects,.
as if his guilt had been already fully proved;
he rendered himself master of the fort and of
the king's stores by violence; he required all
persons to acknowledge him as fuprerme gover-
nor; he ftt at liberty the prisoners confined by
the admiral, and filmmoned him to appear
before his tribunal, in order to answer for his
conduct; tranfinitting to him, together with

the

Boor II. the summons, a copy of the royal mandate, by
~--,- which Columbus was enjoined to yield implicit

obedience to his commands.

Colcis= COLUMBUS, though deeply affected with the
,ch:m to ingratitude and injustice of Ferdinand and Ifa-
sF1i>. bella, did not hesitate a moment about his own

conduct. He submitted to the will of his so-
vereigns with a respectful silence, and repaired
directly to the court of that violent and partial
judge whom they had authorised to try him.
Bovadilla, without admitting him into his pre-
1tnce, ordered him instantly to be arrested,
to be loaded with chains, and hurried on
0os-c:. board a ship. Even under this humiliating re-

verse of fortune, the firmness of mind which
distinguishes the character of Columbus, did
not forsake him. Conscious of his own inte-
gritv, and solacing himself with reflecting upon
the great things which he had achieved, he en-
dured this insult offered to his character, not
only with composure, but with dignity. Nor
had he the consolation of sympathy to mitigate
his ifuserings. Bovadilla had already rendered
himlrelf so extremely popular, by granting va-
rious immunities to the colony, by liberal do-
nations of Indians to all who applied for them,
and by relaxing the reins of discipline and go-
vernmen:, 'that the Spaniards, who were mostly

adventurers,

adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes BooK II.
had impelled to abandon their native country, ,i
expressld the most indecent fatisfaftion with the
disgrace and imprisonment of Columbus. They
flattered themselves, that now they should en-
joy an uncontrouled liberty, more suitable to
their disposition and former habits of life.
Among persons thus prepared to censure the
proceedings, and to asperse the chara&er of
Columbus, Bovadilla collected materials for a
charge against him. All accusations, the most
improbable, as well as inconsistent, were re-
ceived. No informer, however infamous, was
rejected. The result of this inquest, no less in-
decent than partial, he transmitted to Spain.
At the fame time, he ordered Columbus, with
his two brothers, to be carried thither in fetters;
and, adding cruelty to insult, he confined them
in different ships, and excluded them from the
comfort of that friendly intercourfe.which might
have toothed their common distress. But while
the Spaniards in Hispaniola viewed the arbitrary
and insolent proceedings of Bovadilla with a ge-
neral approbation, which reflects dishonour upon
their name and country, one man still retained
the memory of the great actions which Colum-
bus had performed, and was touched with the
sentiments of veneration and pity d-ue to his
rank, his age, and his merit. Alonfo de Val-

lejo,

BooK HI. lejo, the captain of the vessel on board which
'i-o. the admiral was confined, as soon as he was clear

of the island, approached his prisoner with great
respect, and offered to release him from the
fetters with which he was unjuffly loaded.
" No," replied Columbus, with a generous in-
dignation, " I wear these irons in consequence
of an order from my sovereigns. They flall
find me as obedient to this as to their other in-
junaions. By their command I have been con-
fined, and their command alone shall set me a;
liberty '."

xNC. :. 'FORTUNATELY, the voyage to Spain was ex-
zy, be; e- tremely short. As soon as Ferdinand and Ifa-
e,-..'i. bella were informed that Columbus was brought

home a prisoner, and in chains, they perceived
at once what universal aflonifhment this event
mufi occasion, and what an impression to their
difldvantage it mufft make. All Europe, they
foresaw, would be filled with indignation at this
ungenerous requital of a man who had per-
formed actions worthy of the highest recom-
pence, and would exclaim against the injustice
of the nation, to which he had been such an
eminent benefactor, as well as against the in-

tion for this injury, but to efface the stain which
it might fix upon their character, they instantly
issued orders to set Columbus at liberty, invited Dec.. 17.
him to court, and remitted money to enable
him to appear there in a manner suitable to his
rank. When he entered the royal pretence,
Columbus threw himself at the feet of his so-
vereigns. He remained for some time silent;
the various pafflions which agitated his mind
fupprelling his power of utterance. At length
he recovered himself, and vindicated his con-
ducit in a long discourse, producing the most ia-
tisfying proofs of his own integrity as well as
good intention, and evidence, no lets clear, of
the malevolence of his enemies, who, not fa-
tisfied with having ruined his fortune, laboured
to deprive him of what alone was now left, his
honour and his fame. Ferdinand received him
with decent civility, and I'abella with tender-
nels and refpe&c. They both expressed their
sorrow for what had happened, disavowed their
knowledge of it, and joined in promising him
protection and future favour. But though they
inflantly degraded Bovadilla, in order to re-
move from themselves any suspicion of having
authorinld his violent proceedings, they did not

leges as viceroy of those countries which he had
discovered. Though willing to appear the aven-
gers of Columbus's wrongs, that illiberal jea-
louv' which prompted them to invest Bovadilla
with such authority as put it in his power to
treat the admiral with indignity still subsisted.
fThev were afraid to trust a man to whom they
were so highly indebted, and retaining him at
court under various pretexts, they appointed
Nicholas de Ovando, a knight of the military
order of Alcantara, governor of Hispaniola5.

COLUiMBUS was deeply asse'ted with this new

insurv, which came from hands that seemed to
be employed in making reparation for his past
sufferings. The sensibility with which great
minds feel every thing that implies any suspicion
of their integrity, or that wears the apeat of an
a.ront, is exquisite. Columbus had experienced
both from the Spaniards; and their ungenerous
conduct exafpera:ed him to such a degree, that
he could no longer conceal the sentiments which
it excited. W'herever he went, he carried

titude, thou5 fetters with which he had been

distinction, fitted out two ships in co-partnery January.
with John de la Cosa, who having served under
the admiral in two of his voyages, was deemed
the most skilful pilot in Spain. They steered
directly towards the continent, arrived on the
coast of Paria, and proceeding to the weft, dif-
covered all the coast of the province now known
by the name of Tierra Firm:, from Cape de
Vela to the gulf of Darien. Not long after
Ojeda, with his former aoflciate Amerigo Ve-
fpucci, set out upon a second voyage, and
being unacquainted with the destination of
Baftidas, held the fame courle, and touched at
the fame places. The voyage of Baftidas was
prosperous and lucrative, that of Ojeda unfor-
tunate. But both tended to increase the ardour
of diicovery; for in proportion as the Spaniards

extremely requisite, in order to stop the incon-
fiderate career of Bovadilla, whose imprudent
administration threatened the settlement with

of his proceedings against Columbus, he con-

and reduced all the people of the island to a

the Spaniards was too rapacious and impatient
to try any method of acquiring wealth but that
of searching for gold, this servitude became as
grievous as it was unjust. The Indians were
driven in crowds to the mountains, and com-
pelled to work in the mines by masters, who

in the unpleasant employment of soliciting the k.
favour of an ungrateful court, and, notwith-
ttanding all his merit and services, he solicited
in vain. He demanded, in terms of the ori-
ginal capitulation in one thousand four hundred
and ninety-two, to be reinstated in his office of
viceroy over the countries which he had disco-
vered. By a strange fatality, the circumstance
which he urged in support of his claim, de-
termined a jealous monarch to reject it. The
greatness of his discoveries, and the profpea of
their increasing value, made Ferdinand confider
the concefflons in the capitulation as extrava-
gant and impolitic. He was afraid ofentrufting
a subject with the exercise of ajurifdi&ion that
now appeared to be so extremely extensive, and
might grow to be no less formidable. He in-
ipired Isabella with the fame suspicions; and
under various pretexts, equally frivolous and
unjust, they eluded all Columbus's requisitions
to perform that which a solemn treaty bound
them to accomplish. After attending the court
of Spain for near two years, as an humble
fiitor, he found it impossible to remove Ser-
dinand's prejudices and apprehensions; and
perceived, at length, that he laboured in vain,
when he urged a claim of iuifice or merit with
an interested and unfeeling prince.

f- ..-. cf excited him to attempt difcoverv. To open a
C.;(. ,
t .

new paflage to the East Indies was his original
and favourite scheme. This fcill engrossed his
thoughts; and either from his own observations
in his voyage to Paria, or from some obscure
hint of the natives, or from the accounts given
by Baflidas and dc la Cosa, of their expedition,
he conceived an opinion that, beyond the con-
tinent of Am tri-a, there was a Iea which ex-
tended to the Ea:I Indies, and hoped to find
E.Gme b:r-it or narrow neck of land, by which a
comm.21nicatkon miglht be opened with it and
the part of the ocean already known. By a
very fortunate cDiedture, he supposed this strait
or ithil-hus to be situated near the gulf of
Darien. Full of this idea, though he was now
or .n adva:'ccd age, worn out with fatigue, and
.,oken with iu::r-mities, le offered, with the
a:acri:' of a youthful adventurer, to undertake
a vovage wh.ch would alcertain this important
p.iint, and ;.rf&rt the grand fcheime which from
th.e beginnirg he proposed to accomplifT. Se-
veral circu.n'.lances concurred in dclifpofing Ser-
dinand anIabcila to lend a favourable ear to
tlis propo:al. They were gl.a to have the
Frc:exc: -: a.-.- -.onourable employment for re-

m'.ovipg

moving from court a man with whose demands BooK If.
they deemed it impolitic to comply, and whole I,
services it was indecent to neglect. Though
unwilling to reward Columbus, they were not
insen ible of his merit, and from their experience
of his skill and conduct, had reason to give
credit to his conjectures, and to confide in his
success. To these considerations, a third must
be added of fill more powerful influence. About
this time the Portuguese fleet, under Cabral,
arrived from the Indies; and, by the richness
of its cargo, gave the people of Europe a more
perfeil idea, than they had hitherto been able
to form, of the opulence and fertility of the east.
The Portuguese had been more fortunate .n
their discoveries than the Spaniards. They had
opened a communication with countries where
indullrv, arts, and elegance flourished; and
where commerce had been longer eftablihled,
and carried to greater extent than in any region
of the earth. Their first voyages thither yielded
immediate, as well as vast returns of profit, in
commodities extremely precious and in great
requelt. Lisbon became immediately the feat
of commerce and of wealth; while Spain had
only the expectation of remote benefit, and of
future gain, from the western world. Nothing,
,hen, could be more acceptable to the Spa-
i;iards than Columbus's ol1er to conduct them

to

BOor II. to the east, by a route which he expected to be

7-.-_ ihorter, as well as less dangerous, than that

which the Portuguese had taken. Even Ser-
dinand was routed by such a profpeci, and
warmly approved of the undertaking.

;.-
'-:F . BUT, interesting as the objech of this voyage

was to the nation, Columbus could procure
only four finall barks, the largest of which did
not exceed feventv tons in burden, for per-
forming it. Accustomed to brave danger, and
to engage in arduous undertakings with inade-
quate force, he did not hesitate to accept the
command of this pitiful squadron. His brother
Bartholomew, and his second son Ferdinand,
the hilhor'!.n of his actions, accompanied him.
He sillc fronm Cadiz on the ninth of May, and
touched, as usual, at the Canary Islands; from
thence ;.c purpofe.i to have stood directly for
t-e co:.i.en:; hu: his largest vessel was so
clumf' a-nd unEt for service, as constrained him
to Lear aw-y for Hispaniola, in hopes of ex-
cha- ir., I:.r for .ome ship of the fleet that had
:.-: :. carried out Ovn.-o. When he arrived off St.

Domingo, he found eighteen of there flips
rcdr ..lo^ d, a-.d on t'he point of departing for
Sp.:-n. Columbus immediately acquainted the
ov-erm-or v.! the destination of his voyage,
a-. Ihes^;c ac'--!cnt which had obliged him .o alter

hllis

his route. He requeffted permission to enter BooK ]I.
the harbour, not only that he might negociate
the exchange of his ship, but that he might
take flelter during a violent hurricane, of
which he discerned the approach from various
prognostics, which his experience and sagacity
had taught him to observe. On that account,
he advised him likewise to put off for some
days the departure of the fleet bound for Spain.
But Ovando refused his request and despised
his counsel. Under circumstances in which
humanity would have afforded refuge to a ftran-
ger, Columbus was denied admittance into a
country of which he had discovered the existence,
and acquired the possession. His salutary warn-
ing, which merited the greatest attention, was
regarded as the dream of a visionary prophet,
who arrogantly pretended to predict an event
beyond the reach of human foresight. The
fleet set fail for Spain. Next night the hurri-
cane came on with dreadful impetuosity. Co-
lumbus, aware of the danger, took precautions
against it, and saved his little squadron. The
fleet destined for Spain met with the fate which
the ralhnefs and obstinacy of its commanders
deserved. Of eighteen ships two or three only
elcaped. In this general wreck perished Bova-
dilla, Roldan, and the greater part of those
who had been the most active in persecuting

Columbus,

Boca II. Columbus, and oppressing the Indians. To-

,7c'. gether with themselves, all the wealth which

they had acquired by their injutifice and cruelty
was swallowed up. It exceeded in value two
hundred thousand pesos; an. immense fum at
that period, and sufficient not only to have
icreened them from any severe scrutiny into
their condu&, but to have secured them a gra-
cious reception in the Spanish court. Among
t-e Ihips that escaped, one had on board all the
effeets of Columbus which had been recovered
from the wreck of his fortune. Historians,
struck with the exact dilerimination of cha-
racters, as well as the just difiribution of re-
wards and punilhments, conspicuous in those
events, universally attribute them to an imm1ie-
diate interposition of divine Providence, in
order to avenge the wrongs of an injured man,
znd to punish the oppreffiors of an innocent
people. Upon the ignorant and superstitious
race of men, who were witnesses of this ocur-
rence, it made a diti'rent impreiTion. From
an opinion, whilh vulgar admiration is apt to

and dangerous voyage, he discovered Guanaia, ocan'
an island not far distant from the coast of Hon-
duras. There he had an interview with some
inhabitants of the continent, who arrived in a
large canoe. They appeared to be a people
more civilized, and who had made greater pro-
grefs in the knowledge of useful arts, than any
whom he had hitherto discovered. In return
to the inquiries which the Spaniards made,
with their usual eagerness, concerning the
places where the Indians got the gold which
they wore by way of ornament, they dire&ed
them to countries situated to the weft, in which
gold was found in such profusion, that it was
aipplied to the most common uses. Instead of
lftering in quest of a country so inviting, which
would have condu&ed him along the coast of
Yucatan to the rich empire of Mexico, Colum-
bus was so bent upon his favourite scheme of
finding out that strait which communicated
with the Indian ocean, that he bore away to the

s;-. gation he discovered all the coast of the conti-

nent, from Cape Gracias a Dios, to a harbour
which, on account of its beauty and security,
he called Porto Bello. He searched, in vain,
for the imaginary (trait, through which he ex-
pected to make his way into an unknown lea;
and though he went on shore several times, and
advanced into the country, he did not penetrate
so far as to cross the narrow isthmus which fe-
parates the gulf of Mexico from the great
southern ocean. He was so much delighted,
however, with the fertility of the country, and
conceived such an idea of its wealth, from the
specimens of gold produced by the natives, that
he resolved to leave a fimall colony upon the
river Belem, in the province of Veragua, under

self to Spain, in order to procure what was re-
q':ifite for rendering the establishment perma-
nent. But the ungovernable spirit of the peo-
ple under his command, deprived Columbus
of the glory of planting the first colony on the
continent of America. Their insolence and
rapacioufr.efs provoked the natives to take arms,

vice; and with the two which remained, he
quitted that part of the continent which in his
anguiln he named the Coast of Vexation , and
bore away for Hispaniola. New distresses
awaited him in this voyage. He was driven

were so much flattered by the shock, that with
the utmost difficulty they reached Jamaica, June 24.

.,o0. was cast ashore upon an island at a considerable

distance from the only settlement of the Spa-
niards in America. His ships were ruined
beyond the possibility of being repaired. To
convey an account of his situation to Hifpa-
niola, appeared impracticable; and without this
it was vain to expect relief. His genius, ser-
tile in rcfources, and mofil vigorous in those
perilous extremities when feeble minds abandon
themselves to despair, discovered the only ex-
pedient which afforded any profpec. of deli-
verance. He had recourse to the hospitable
kindness of the natives, who confidering the
Spaniards as beings of a superior nature, were
ea.er, on ever' occasion, to minister to their
x.ants. From them he obtained two of their
canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a single
tree, hollowed with fire, and so mis-shapen and
aukv.'ard as hardly to merit the name of boats.
In these, which were fit only for creeping along
the coast, or crossing from one fide of a bay to

for his own fellow-citizens involved in the fame

Fiefchi spent eight months in soliciting relief
for their commander and associates, without any
profpc&l of obtaining it.

DLRINaG this period, various passions agi- Hi i;nrfar

the molt desponding. After some time the
more timorous began to fuiope&t that they had
miscarried in their daring attempt. At length, ,5o4.
all concluded that they had perishcd. The ray
of hope which had broke in upon them, made

Bo- II. their condition appear now more dismal. De-

. ipair, heightened by disappointment, fettled in

every breafr. Their last resource had failed,
and nothing remained but to end their miser-
able days among naked savages, far from their
country and their friends. The seamen, in a
transport of rage, rose in open mutiny, threat-
ened the life of Columbus, whom they re-
proached as the author of all their calamities,
seized ten canoes, which he had purchased from
the Indians, and delpifing his remonfprances
and entreaties, made off with them to a distant
part of the island. At the fame time, the na-
tives murmured at the long residence of the
Spaniards in their country. As their industry
was not greater than that of their neighbours in
liifpaniola, like them, they found the burden
of supporting so many firangers to be altogether
intolerable. They began to bring in provisions
with relu&ance, the' furnified them with a
sparing hand, and threaz.e.edl to withdraw those

-.ip-iies altogether. Such a resolution must
quickly have been fatal to the Spaniards. Their
'afetv depended upon the good will of the In-
d.ans; and unlels they could revive the ad-
minration and reverence with w;nich that simple
people had at first beleld the., destruction was
unavoidable. Though the liccLn:ious proceed-
ings of the mutineers had, in .1 great ::.afure,

el';:te ed

effaced those impreflions which had been so fa- BOOK II.
vourable to the Spaniards, the ingenuity of o+4.
Columbus suggested a happy artifice, that not
only restored but heightened the high opinion
which the Indians had originally entertained of
them. By his skill in astronomy, he knew that
there was shortly to be a total eclipse of the
moon. He assembled all the principal persons
of the district around him on the day before it
happened, and, after reproaching them for their
fickleness in withdrawing their affection and
assistance from men whom they had lately re-
vered, he told them, that the Spaniards were
servants of the Great Spirit who dwells in
heaven, who made and governs the world that
he, offended at their refusing to support men
who were the objects of his peculiar favour, was
preparing to punish this crime with exemplary
severity, and that very night the moon should
withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue,
as a sign of the divine wrath, and an emblem
of the vengeance ready to fall upon them. To
this marvellous prediction some of them listened
with the careless indifference peculiar to the
people of America; others, with the credulous
atIonifhment natural to barbarians. But when
the moon began gradually to be darkened, and
at length appeared of a red colour, all were
ftreck with terror. They ran with conrferna-

R 2 tion

BooK IT. t;on to their houses, and returning inftantlv to

Columbus loaded with provisions, threw them
at his feet, coniuring him to intercede with the
Great Spirit to avert the delfrucsion with which
they were threatened. Columbus, seeming to
be moved by their entreaties, promised to com-
ply with their desire. The eclipse went off,
rthe moon recovered its splendour, and from
that day the Spaniards were not only furnished
profufciv with provisions, but the natives, with
Jiuperftitious attention, avoided every thing that
could give them offence'.

A ---'2.- DURING those tranfaEtions, the mutineers
...... had made repeated attempts to pass over to

Hispaniola in the canoes which they had seized.
But, from their own misconduct, or the vio-
lence of the winds and currents, their efforts
were all unluccefsful. Enraged at this difap-
]j.on;rment,they marched towards that part ofthe
i.-.nd where Cohlinmbus remained, threatening
.::-;n with new inl :;ts and danger. While they
wcre advancing, an event happened, more

dark suspicions of Columbus, lent a finall bark BooK I1.
to Jamaica, not to deliver his distressed coun- ,r,^.
trymen, but to spy out their condition. Left
the tympathy of those whom he employed
fihould afford them relief, contrary to his in-
tention, he gave the command of this vessel
to Etcobar, an inveterate enemy of Colum-
bus, who adhering to his inftrucions with
malignant accuracy, cast anchor at some dif-
tance from the island, approached the flhore
in a flnall boat, observed the wretched plight
of the Spaniards, delivered a letter of empty
compliment to the admiral, received his an-
fwer, and departed. When the Spaniards first
delcried the vessel standing towards the island,
every heart exulted, as if the long-expe&ed
hour of their deliverance had at length arrived;
but when it disappeared so suddenly, they funk
into the deepest dejection, and all their hopes
died away. Columbus alone, though he felt
molt sensibly this wanton insult which Ovando
added to his past neglect, retained such com-
pofuri of mind, as to be able to cheer his fol-
lowers. He assured them, that Mendez and
Fiel:chi had reached Hispaniola in safety; that
they would speedily procure filips to carry them
o:F; but as Efcobar's veffTl could not take them
all on board, that he had refused to go with
h:cr, bec:ute he was determined never to aban-

,IsC4 Soothed with the expectation of speedy deliver-

ance, and delighted with his apparent gene-
rofity in attending more to their preservation
than to his own safety, their Spirits revived, and
he regained their confidence .

\\ITHOUT this confidence, he could not have

resifted the mutineers, who were now at hand.
All his endeavours to reclaim those desperate
men had no effect but to increase their frenzy.
Their demands became every day more extra-
-agant, and their intentions more violent and
bluodv. The common safety rendered it ne-
ceffary to oppose them with open force. Co-
lumbus, who had been long afflicted with the
gout, could. not take the field. His brother,
the Adcl.nt:do, marched against them. They
quickly met. The mutineers rejected with
scorn terms of accommodation, wvhich were
once more offered them, and rushed on boldly
to the attack. They fell not upon an enemy
unprepared to receive them. In the first Ihock,
if-ver- of their most daring leaders were slain.
The Adelantado, whose strength was equal to
h's co:-rage, closed with their captain, wounded,

of this, the reft fled with a dastardly fear, suit- i.
able to their former insolence. Soon after, they
submitted in a body to Columbus, and bound
themi-elves by the mroft solemn oaths to obey
all his commands. Hardly was tranquillity
re-ellablifhed, when the ships appeared, whose
arrival Columbus had promised with great ad-
dress, though he could foresee it with little cer-
tainty. With transports of joy, the Spaniards
quitted an island in which the unfeeling jealousy
of Ovando had suffered them to languish above
a year, exposed to misery in all its various
forms.

injured him. To solicit a prince thus preju-
diced against him, was an occupation no less
irklomie than hopeless. In this, however, was
Columbus doomed to employ the close of his
days. As soon as his health was in some de-
gree re-eftabliihed, he repaired to court; and
though he was received there with civility
barely decent, he plied Ferdinand with peti-
tion atter petition, demanding the punishment
of his oppressors, and the restitution of all the
privileges bestowed upon him by the capitula-
tion of one thousand four hundred and ninety-
two. Ferdinand amused him with fair words
and unmeaning promises. Instead of granting
his claims, he proposed expedients in order to
elude them, and spun out the affair with such
apparent art, as plainly discovered his intention
that it flould never be terminated. The de-
clining health of Columbus flattered Ferdinand
with the hopes of being soon delivered from
an importunate suitor, and encouraged him to
persevere in this illiberal plan. Nor was he
deceived in his expectations. Disgusted with
the ingratitude of a monarch whom he had
1ervcd with such fidelity and f;lccefs, exhaufred
with the fatigues and hardships which he had
c'ndurcd, and broken with the infirmities which

which distinguished his character, and with
sentiments of piety becoming that supreme

every occurrence of his life'.

H HILE Columbus was employed in his BOOK 111.
last voyage, several events worthy of -t

notice happened in Hispaniola. The colony Stte ofthe
there, the parent and nurse of all the fubfe- Hiflpaiola.
quent eftabliflments of Spain in the New
World, gradually acquired the form of a re-
gular and prosperous society. The humane
solicitude of Isabella to protect the Indians from
opprefflon, and particularly the proclamation,
by which the Spaniards were prohibited to
compel them to work, retarded, it is true, for
some time, the progress of improvement. The
natives, who confidered exemption from toil as
fiipreme felicity, scorned every allurement and
rcw.lrd by which they were invited to labour.
The Spaniards had not a sufficient number of
hands either to work the mines or to cultivate

the

Boor. 11i. the foil. Several of the first coloniess, who
,--.w had been accustomed to the service of the In-

dians, quitted the island, when deprived of
thole instruments, without which they knew
no: hoow to carry on any operation. Many of
the new settlers who came over with Ovando,
were seized with the distempers peculiar to the
cima.e, and in a short space above a thousand
of themr died. At the fame time, the exacting
one half of the product: of the mines as the
rovai lft.re, was found to be a demand so
exorbitant, that no adventurers would engage
to work them upon such terms. In order to
save the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured
155. ;to reiax the rigour of the royal edicts. He

made a new distribution of the Indians among
the Suaniards, and com:,elled themn to labour,
for a stated .i"me, in digging the mines, or in
c'.:i:ivating the ground ; but, in order to screen
hin.,elf fro:n the imputation of having sub-
jc6ted them ag=in to se'rvitude, he enjoined
t e:- -malers to pay them _ certain fum, as the

regulations'. Io

BeT the Indians, after enjoying respite from war with

oppreflion, though during a fliort interval, now th Indias.
felt the yoke of bondage to be so galling, that
they made ieveral attempts to vindicate their
own liberty. This the Spaniards confidered as
rebellion, and took arms in order to reduce
them to fubiection. When war is carried on
between nations whose state of improvement is
in any degree similar, the means of defence
bear iiome proportion to those employed in
the attack; and in this equal contest such
efforts muff be made, such talents are displayed,
and such passions roused, as exhibit mankind
to view in a situation no less striking than
interesting. It is one of the noblest functions
of history, to observe and to delineate men at
a juncture when their minds are most violently
agitated, and all their powers and pafflions are
called forth. Hence the operations of war,
and the ifruggles between contending states,
have been deemed by historians, ancient as
well as modern, a capital and important article

most

BooK II. mofl warlike of the European nations, where
1.:. science, courage, and discipline on one fide,

were opposed by ignorance, timidity, and dif-
order on the other, a particular detail of events
would be as unpleasant as uninftructive. If
the simplicity and innocence of the Indians had
inspired the Spaniards with humanity, had soft-
ened the pride of superiority into compassion,
and had induced them to improve the inha-
bitants of the New World, instead of oppref-
sing them, some sudden acts of violence, like
the too rigorous chastisements of impatient in-
ftructors, might have been related without
horror. But, unfortunately, this consciousness
of superiority operated in a different manner.
The Spaniards were advanced so far beyond
the natives of America in improvement of every
kind, that they viewed them with contempt.
They conceived the Americans to be animals
of an inferior nature, who were not intitled to
the rights and privileges of men. In peace,
thev iub:,;eted them to tervitude. In war, they
paid no regard to those laws, which, by a tacit
convention between contending nations, regu-
Lre hostility, and set some bounds to its rage.
Thev confidered them not as men fighting in
dctc:nce of their liberty, but as slaves, who had
revoked against their masters. Their caziques,
.':cn :-k.cr., were condemned, like the leaders

of

of banditti, to the most cruel and ignominious BooK III.
punishments; and all their fubjefs, without 7505
regarding the diftinftion of ranks established
among them, were reduced to the fame state
of abjea slavery. With such a spirit and fen-
timents were hostilities carried on against the
cazique of Higuey, a province at the eastern
extremity of the island. This war was occa-
sioned by the perfidy of the Spaniards, in
violating a treaty which they had made with
the natives, and it was terminated by hanging
up the cazique, who defended his people with
bravery so far superior to that of his country-
men, as intitled him to a better fate b.

THE conduct of Ovando, in another part of The cruel

The province anciently named Xaragua, which ot o""l.do.
extends from the fertile plain where Leogane
is now situated, to the western extremity of the
island, was subject to a female cazique, named
Anacoana, highly refpe:ed by the natives.
She, from that partial fondness with which the
women of America were attached to the Euro-
peans (the cause of which shall be afterwards
explained), had always courted the friendship
of the Spaniards, and loaded them with good

.~05. having fettled in her country, were so much

exasperated at her endeavouring to restrain
their excesses, that they accused her of having
formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and to
exterminate the Spaniards. Ovando, though
he knew well how little credit was due to such
profligate men, marched, without further in-
quiry, towards Xaragua, with three hundred
foot and seventy horsemen. To prevent the
Indians from taking alarm at this hostile ap-
pearance, he gave out that his sole intention
was to visit Anacoana, to whom his country-
men had been so much indebted, in the moss
rcpectful manner, and to regulate with her
the mode of levying the tribute payable to the
k-ins of Spain. Anacoana, in order to receive
this illustrious guest with due honour, afflem-
bled the principal men in her dominions, to
the number of three hundred, and advancing
at the head of these, accompanied by a vast
croud of persons of inferior rank, she welcomed
Ovando with songs and dances, according to
the mode of the country, and conducted him
to the place of her residence. There he was
ftaited, for some days, with all the kindness of
fimi:e holfpitality, and amused with the games
and f'-ectacles utual among the Americans
upon occa;:ons of mirth and feilivity. But,

amid 11

amidfL the security which this inspired, Ovando BooKIII.
was meditating the deftru&ion of his unfufpi- `--'
cious entertainer and her subjects; and the
mean perfidy with which he executed this
scheme, equalled his barbarity in forming it.
Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the
parade of an European tournament, he ad-
vanced with his troops, in battle array, towards
the house in which Anacoana and the chiefs
who attended her were assembled. The in-
fantry took possession of all the avenues which
led to the village. The horsemen encompassed
the house. These movements were the object
of admiration without any mixture of fear,
until, upon a signal which had been concerted,
the Spaniards suddenly drew their swords, and
ruffed upon the Indians, defenceless, and afto-
nilhed at an a&t of treachery which exceeded
the conception of tindefigning men. In a
moment Anacoana was secured. All her at-
tendants were seized and bound. Fire was
fct to the house; and, without examination or
conviction, all these unhappy persons, the most
illustrious in their own country, were consumed
in the flames. Anacoana was reserved for a
more ignominious fate. She was carried in
chains to Saint Domingo, and, after the for-
mality of a trial before Spanish judges, she
was condemned, upon the evidence of those

regulations tending to mitigate the rigour of

tuityv aid to them as the price of their labour
was wvithdrawn ; and at the fame time the tasks

wi;thout any restraint, distributed Indians among

rcve-nue arising from the settlements in the
New W\orld, conferred grants of a similar
na:ure u;-un his courtiers, as the least expen-

barbarous as their policy was, and fatal to the 1506.
inhabitants of Hispaniola, it produced, for
some time, very considerable effects. By call-
ing forth the force of a whole nation, and
exerting it in one direction, the working of the
mines was carried on with amazing rapidity
and fuccels. During several years, the gold
brought into the royal fmelting-houfes in His-
paniola amounted annually to four hundred
and sixty thQufand pesos, above a hundred
thousand pounds sterling; which, if we attend
to the great change in the value of money since
the beginning of the sixteenth century to the
present times, muff appear a considerable fum.
Vast fortunes were created, of a sudden, by
some. Others dissipated in ostentatious pro-
fufilon, what they acquired with facility.
Dazzled by both, new adventurers crouded to
America, with the most eager impatience, to
flhare in those treasures which had enriched
their countrymen; and, notwithstanding the
mortality occasioned by the unhealthiness of
the climate, the colony continued to increase'.

S 2 which

Bc,'ITTT. which he treated the Indians. He established

,.6. equal laws, and, by executing them with im-

partiality, accustomed the people of the colony
to, reverence them. He founded several new
towns in different parts of the island, and
a/u!red inhabitants to them, by the concession
of various immunities. He endeavoured to
turn the attention of the Spaniards to some
branch of indu!iry more useful than that of
search ng for gold in the mines. Some flips
of the fi',gar-cane having been brought from
the Canary islands by way of experiment, they
were found to thrive with such increase in the
rich foil and warm climate to which they were
transplanted, that the cultivation of them soon
became an objec of commerce. Extensive
plantations were begun; fugar-works, which
the Span.irds called igetio's, from the various
machinery employed in them, were erected,
ar.d in a few years the manufacture of this
commodity was the great occupation of the
inhabitants of Hispaniola, and the most con-
fiderable source of their wealth .

P.'.:'-.-- THE pruden: endcavours of Ovando, to pro-
r. ..;.a . mote the weifare of the colon', were power-

fully seconded by Ferdinand. The large re-

mittances

mittances which he received from the New 1hor. IiL
\Vorld, opened his eyes, at length, with refpec i56.
to the importance of those discoveries, which
he had hitherto affected to undervalue. For-
tune, and his own address, having now extri-
cated him out of those difficulties in which he
had been involved by the death of his queen, 1507.
and by his disputes with his fon-in-law about
the government of her dominions ', he had
full leisure to turn his attention to the affairs
of America. To his provident sagacity, Spain
is indebted for many of those regulations which
gradually formed that system of profound, but
jealous policy, by which she governs her domi-
nions in the New World. He ereEted a court,
distinguished by the title of the Casa de Con-
Iratacion, or Board of Trade, composed of per-
sons eminent for rank and abilities, to whom
he committed the administration of American
affairs. This board assembled regularly in
Seville, and was invested with a distin& and
extensive jurifdicfion. He gave a regular form
to ecclesiastical government in America, by
nominating archbishops, bishops, deans, toge-
ther with clergymen of subordinate ranks, to
take charge of the Spaniards established there,
as well as of the natives who should embrace

,_0-. obsequious devotion of the Spanish court to

the Papal See, such was Ferdinand's solicitude
to prevent any foreign power from claiming
jurisdiction, or acquiring influence, in his new
dominions, that he reserved to the crown of
Spain the role right of patronage to the bene-
sices in America, and ffipulated that no papal
bull or mandate should be promulgated there,
until it was previouflv examined and approved
of by .iis council. With the fame spirit of
jealc-ilv, he prohibited any goods to be ex-
ps'. e Eto America, or any person to fettle
there, without a special licence from that
council s.

Tt.m,- BUT, notwithstanding this attention to the
ct .t: In-
ii-- ,:mi- police and welfare of the colon., a calamity

impended which rhreatened its dissolution. The
original inhabitants, on whose labour the Spa-
niards in Hispaniola depenied for their profpe-
rity, and even their exislence, wafted so fast,
that the extinction of the whole race seemed to
be inevitable. When Columbus discovered
Hispaniola, the number of its inhabitants was
computed to be at least a million a. They
were now reduced to fixtv thousand in the

space of fifteen years. This consumption of B13K I1I.
the human Ipecies, no less amazing than rapid, 1.. a
was the effe&t of several concurring cauli's.
The natives of the American islands were of a
more feeble confritution than the inhabitants
of the other hemisphere. They could neither
prrform the fame work, nor endure the fame
fatigue, with men whose organs were of a more
vigorous conformation. The listless indolence
in which they delighted to pass their days, as
it was the effeca of their debility, contributed
likewile to increase it, and rendered them, from
habit as well as constitution, incapable of hard
labour. The food on which they subsisted,
afforded little nourishment, and they were ac-
customed to take it in fimall quantities, not
fulficient to invigorate a languid frame, and
render it equal to the efforts of active industry.
The Spaniards, without attending to those
peculiarities in the confsitution of the Ameri-
cans, imposed tasks upon them so difpropor-
tioned to their strength, that many funk under
the fatigue, and ended their wretched days.
Others, prompted by impatience and despair,
cut short their own lives with a violent hand.
Famine, brought on by compelling such num-
bers to abandon the culture of their lands, in
order to labour in the mines, proved fatal to
many. Diseases of various kinds, some occa-

the Europeans, completed the desolation of
the island. The Spaniards being thus deprived
of the instruments which they were accutiomed
to employ, found it impossible to extend their
improvements, or even to carry on the works
SC3. which they had already begun. In order to

provide an immediare remedy for an evil so
alarming, Ovando proposed to transport the
inhabitants of the Lucayo islands to Hifpa-
niola, under pretence that they might be civi-
lized with more facility, and instructed to
greater advantage in the Chrillian religion, if
they were united to the Spanish colony, and
under the immediate inspection of the miffliona-
ries fettled there. Ferdinand, deceived by this
artifice, or willing to connive at an acft of
violence which policy represented as ncceflary,
gave his assent to the proposal. Several veftels
were fitted out for the Lucayo<, the com-
manders of which informed the natives, with
whose language they were now well acquainted,
that they came from a delicious country, in
which the departed ancestors of the Indians
resided, by whom they were sent to invite their
descendents to resort thither, to partake of the
blils enioyed there by happy spirits. That
fitmple people listened with wonder and credu-

lityv

lity; and, fond of visiting their relations and BooK I.f-
friends in that happy region, followed the Uis.
Suaniards with eagerness. By this artifice,
above forty thousand were decoyed into Hispa-
niola, to share in the sufferings which were the
lot of the inhabitants of that island, and to
mingle their groans and tears with those of that
wretched race of men i.

TiE Spaniards had, for some timne, carried Ne disco-

on their operations in the mines of Hispaniola ,leim...
with such ardor as well as success, that these
fecnced to have engrolled their whole attention.
The spirit of discovery languished; and, since
the latl voyage of Columbus, no enterprize of
any moment had been undertaken. But as the
decreale of the Indians rendered it impossible
to acquire wealth in that island with the fame
rapidity as formerly, this urged them to search
fur new countries, where their avarice might
be gratified with more facility. Juan Ponce
de Leon, who commanded under Ovando in
the ealtern diltriat of Hispaniola, palsfd over
to the illand of St. Juan de Puerto Rico, which
Columbus had difeovered in his second voyage,
and penetrated into the interior part of the
country. As he found the foil to be fertile,

1s5S. from the information of the inhabitants, to,

discover mines of gold in the mountains,
Ovando permitted him to attempt making a
settlement in the island. This was easily
effeEted by an officer eminent for conduct no
less than for courage. In a few years Puerto
Rico was lubjected to the Spanish government,
the natives were reduced to servitude; and,
being treated with the fame inconsiderate rigour
as their neighbours in Hispaniola, the race of
original inhabitants, worn ou: with fatigue and
sufferings, was soon exterminated .

ABOUT the fame time, Juan Diaz de Solis,

in conjunction with Vincent Yanez Pinzon,
one of Columbus's original companions, made
a voyage to the continent. They held the
fame course which Columbus had taken, as
far as to the island of Guanaios; but, standing
from thence to the weft, they discovered a
new and extensive province, aftcrwards known
by the name of Yucatan, and proceeded a con-
fiderable wav along the coast of that country I.
Though nothing memorable occurred in this
voyage, it deserves notice, beckc:! it led to

disco-

discoveries of greater importance. For the BooK;IIL
ahme reason, the voyage of Sebastian deOcampo ,so.
must be mentioned. By the command of 0-
vando, he failed round Cuba, and first disco-
vered, with certainty, that this country, which
Columbus once supposed to be a part of the
continent, was a large island .

THIS voyage round Cuba was one of the Diego Co-

last occurrences under the administration of ptointedgo-
Ovando. Ever since the death of Columbus, fpaia..
his son Don Diego had been employed in soli-
citing Ferdinand to grant him the offices of
viceroy and admiral in the New World, toge-
ther with all the other immunities and profits
which descended to him by inheritance, in
consequence of the original capitulation of his
father. But if these dignities and revenues
appeared so considerable to Ferdinand, that,
at the expence of being deemed unjust, as well
us ungrateful, he had wrested them from Co-
lumbus, it is not surprising that he should be
unwilling to confer them on his son. Accord-
ingly, Don Diego wafted two years in incessant
but fruitleli importunity. Weary of this, he
endeavoured at length to obtain by a legal fen-

tence,

BooEr II. tence, what he could not procure from the

s favour of an inEerefted monarch. He com-

menced a suit againit Ferdinand before the
council that managed Indian astairs, and that
court, with integrity which reflects honour
upon its proceedings, decided against the king,
and sustaincd Don Diego's claim of the vice-
royalty, together with all the other privileges
stipulated in the capitulation. Even after this
decree, Ferdinand's repugnance to put a sub-
je-t in poifeffion of such extensive rights, might
have thrown in new obilacles, if Don Diego
had not taken a ftep which interested very
powerful persons in the fuccels of his claims.-
The sentence of the council of the Indies gave
him a title to a rank so elevated, and a fortune
so opulent, that he found no difficulty in con-
cluding a marriage with Donna Maria, daugh-
ter of Don Ferdinand de Toledo, great corn-
mendator of Leon, and brother of the duke
of Alva, a nobleman of the firfi rank, and
nearly related to the king. The duke and his
family espoused lo warmly the cause of their
new ally, that Ferdinand could not resist their
,.-9. solicitations. He recalled Ovando, and ap-

pointed Don Diego his successor, though, even
in cor.ferring this favour, he cotuld not conceal
his jealouiy; for he allowed him to affiume

only

only the title of governor, not that of viceroy, BOOK III.
which had been adjudged to belong to him . i509.

DoN Diego quickly repaired to Hispaniola, He ,repa

attended by his brother, his uncles, his wife, to Hirfpa
whom the courtesy of the Spaniards honoured
with the title of vice-queen, and a numerous
retinue of persons of both sexes, born of good
families. He lived with a splendour and mag-
nificence hitherto unknown in the New World;
and the family, of Columbus seemed now to en-
joy the honours and rewards due to his invent-
ive genius, of which he himself had been cruelly
defrauded. The colony itself acquired new
lustre by the acceflion of so many inhabitants,
of a different rank and character from most of
those who had hitherto migrated to America,
and many of the mofe illustrious families in the
Spanish settlements are descended from the per-
sons who at that time accompanied Don Diego
Columbus °.

No benefit accrued to the unhappy natives

from this change of governors. Don Diego
~was not only authorised by a royal edi& to con-
tinue the repartimientos, or distribution of In-

dians,

BooE II. dians, but the particular number which he might

. grant to every person, according to his rank in

the colony, was specified. He availed himself
of that permiflion; and soon after he landed at
St. Domingo, he divided such Indians as were
fill unappropriated, among his relations and
attendants P.
P-,-"ri TiiTE next care of the new governor was to

comply with an instruction which: he received
from the king, about fettling a colony in Cu-
bagua, a small illand which Columbus had dif-
covered in his third voyage. Though this
barren fpoc hardly yielded subsistence to its
wretched inhabitants, such quantities of those
ovfters which produce pearls were found on its
coaei, that it did not long escape the inquisitive
avarice of the Spaniards, and became a place
of considerable resort. Large fortunes were
aeqi7cd by the fishery of pearls, which was
carried on with extraordinary ardour. The
Ildians, cfp)ecially those from the Lucayo
ifianus, were compelled to dive for them; and
this ..angerot;s and unhealthy employment was
an additional calamity, which contributed not
a little to the extinction of that devoted race 9.

ABOUT

ABOUT this period, Juan Diaz de Solis and BooK III.

Pinzon set out, in conjunction, upon a second '
voyage. They stood directly south, towards N.e. voy-
the equinocial line, which Pinzon had for-
merly crossed, and advanced as far as the for-
tieth degree of southern latitude. They were
astonished to find that the continent of America
firetched, on their right hand, through all this
vast extent of ocean. They landed in different
places, to take possession in name of their so-
vereign; but though the country appeared to
be extremely fertile and inviting, their force
was so finall, having been fitted out rather for
discovery than making settlements, that they
left no colony behind them. Their voyage
served, however, to give the Spaniards more
exalted and adequate ideas with refpeft to the
dimensions of this new quarter of the globe r.

Alonlb de Ojeda, who had already made two
voyages as a.difcoverer, by which he acquired
considerable reputation, but no wealth. But
his character for intrepidity and ccnduct easily
procured him associates, who advanced the
money requisite to defray the charges of the ex-
pedition. About the fame time, Diego de Ni-
cucila, who had acquired a large fortune in
Hispaniola, formed a similar design. Ferdinand
encouraged both; and though he refused to
advance '-e fmailel f ibmn, was extremely liberal
of tides and patents. He erecded two govern-
ments on the continent, one extending from
Cape de Veia to the gulf of Darien, and the
other from that to Cape Gracias a Dios. The
ir:nmer was given to Ojeda, the latter to Ni-
c'.cfa. Ojeda fitted out a ship and two brigan-
tines, wv hi three hundred men; Nicuefra, fix

gular or extravagant than the form which they "--
dcvilkd for this purpose. They inftrufted those
iwvaders, as soon as they landed on the conti-
nent, to declare to the natives the principal ar-
ticles of the Christian faith; to acquaint them,
in particular, with the supreme jurisdiction of
the Pope over all the kingdoms of the earth;
to inform them of the grant which this holy
pontiff had made of their country to the king
of Spain; to require them to embrace the doc-
trines of that religion which the Spaniards made
known to them; and to submit to the sovereign
whose authority they proclaimed. If the na-
tives refused to comply with this requisition,
the terms of which must have been utterly in-
con-,prehenfible to uninftructed Indians, then
Ojeda and Nicueffa were authorised to attack
them with sword and fire; to reduce them,
their v. ives and children, to a slate offeirvitude;
and to compel them by force to recognize the
iuril.i&ion of the church, and the authority of
the monarch, to which they would not volun-
tarily fu bjett themselves'.

had never heard, could have any right to dispose

deavoured to effeci by force what they could
not accomplish by persuasion. The contem-
porary writers enter into a very minute detail
in relating their transactions; but as they made
no dilcoverv of importance, nor established any
permanent fc:tlement, their adventures are not
intr:led to any considerable place in the general
hiitorY of a period, where romantic valour,

opposed by people equally resolute in defence Booc III.
of their pofreffions. Nothing could soften their )t.
ferocity. Though the Spaniards employed
every art to soothe them, and to gain their con-
fidence, they refused to hold any intercourse, or
to exchange any friendly office, with men whose
residence among them they confidered as fatal
to their liberty and independence. This im- rsio.
placable enmity of the natives, though it ren-
dered it extremely difficult as well as dangerous
to eflablifh a settlement in their country, might
have been surmounted at length by the perse-
verance of the Spaniards, by the superiority of
their arms, and their skill in the art of war.
But every difaffer which can be accumulated
upon the unfortunate, combined to complete
their ruin. The loss of their ships by various
accidents upon an unknown coafr, the diseases
peculiar to a climate the most noxious in all
America, the want of provisions, unavoidable
in a country imperfectly cultivated, dissention
among themselves, and the incessant hostilities
of the natives, involved them in a fucceflton of
calamities, the bare recital of which strikes one
with horror. Though they received two con-
fiderable reinforcements from Hispaniola, the
greater part of those who had engaged in this
unhappy expedition, periflhed, in less than a

cisco Piz.rro was one of Ojeda's companions,
and in this school of adversity acquired or im-

NOTWITHSTANDING the unfortunate ifflue of BooI: I11.

this expedition, the Spaniards were not deterred ,7,$.
from engaging in new schemes of a Gmilar na- c' of
ture. When wealth is acquired gradually by
the persevering hand of industry, or accumu-
lated by the flow operations of regular com-
merce, the means employed are lo proportioned
to the end attaincd, that there is nothing to
strike the imagination, and little to urge on the
active powers of the mind to uncommon efforts.
But when large fortunes were created almost in-
ftantaneoufly; when gold and pearls were pro-
cured in exchange for baubles; when the coun-
tries which produced there rich commodities,
defended only by naked savages, might be
s:ized by the first bold invader; objecs so fin-
gular and alluring, rouzed a wonderful spirit of
enterprisc among the Spaniards, who rushed
with ardour into this new path that was opened
to wealth and distinction. While this spirit
continued warm and vigorous, every attempt
either towards discovery or conquefl was ap-
plauded, and adventurers engaged in it with
enmulatioli. The parfion 'or new undertaking.,

BooK Il. liar to Hispaniola at this juncture, concurred

with it in extending their navigation and con-
queRs. The rigorous treatment of the inha-
bitants of that island having almost extirpated
the race, many of the Spanish planters, as I
have already observed, finding it impossible to
carry on their works with the fame vigour and
profit, were obliged to look out for settlements
in some country whose people were not yet
wafted by oppression. Others, with the incon-
fiderate levity natural to men upon whom wealth
pours in with a sudden flow, had squandered,
in thoughtless prodigality, what they acquired
with eale, and were driven by necefflty to em-
bark in the most desperate schemes, in order to
uisi. retrieve their affairs. From all these causes,

when Don Diego Columbus proposed to con-
quer the island of Cuba, and to establish a co-
lonv there, many persons of chief diftinaion in
Hispaniola engaged with alacrity in the mea-
sure. He gave the command of the troops
defined for that service to Diego Velasquez,
one of his father's companions in his second
vycvage, and who, having been long fettled in
Hispaniola, had acquired an ample fortune,
with such reputation for probity and prudence,
tha: he seemed to be well qualified for con-
ducting an expedition of impor..nce. Three
hundred men wre dcenemed fuff.cient for the

conquest

conquest of an island above seven hundred miles BOOK HIT.
in length, and filled with inhabitants. But
they were of the fame unwarlike character with
the people of Hispaniola. They were not only
intimidated by the appearance of their new ene-
mies, bit unprepared to resist them. For
though, from the time that the Spaniards took
poffcilon of the adjacent island, there was
reason to expe&t a descent on their territories,
none of the small communities into which Cuba
was divided, had either made any provision for
its own defence, or had formed any concert for
their common safety. The only obstruction
the Spaniards met with was from Hatuey, a
cazique, who had fled from Hispaniola, and
taken possession of the eastern extremity of Cu-
ba. He flood upon the defensive at their firflt
landing, and endeavoured to drive them back
to their ships. His feeble troops, however,
were soon broken and dispersed; and he him-
self being taken prisoner, Velasquez, according
to the barbarous maxim of the Spaniards, con-
fidered him as a slave who had taken arms againfi
his mailer, and condemned him to the flames.
When Hatuey was fattened to the flake, a Fran-
cifcan friar labouring to convert him, promised
him immediate admittance into the joys of
heaven, if he would embrace the Christian faith.
" Are there any Spaniards," fays he, after

BoOK TII. some paule, " in that region of bliss which

. ou describe?" "' Yes," replied the monk,

but only such as are worthy and good."

"The belt of them," returned the indignant
cazique, " have neither worth nor goodness;
I will not go to a place where I may meet with
one of that accurlfed race ." This dreadful ex-
ample of vengeance ifruck the people of Cuba
with such terror, that they scarcely gave any
opposition to the progress of their invaders; and
Velasquez, without the loss of a man, annexed
this extensive and fertile ifand to the Spanish
monarchy r
r-r.-Y :f 'THE facility Vith which this important con-

quest was competed, served as an incitement to
other undertakings. Juan Ponce de Leon,
having acquired both fame and wealth by the
redu.tion of Puerto Rico, was impatient to en-
;'3.- gage in some new enterprise. He fitted out

three Ihips at his own expence, for a voyage of
dcilcovery, and his reputation soon drew to-
gether a refpeEtable body of followers. He
d:rectcd his course towards the Lucayo illands;
and afrtr touching at several of them, as well
as of the Bahama isles, he flood to the south-

wecf, and discovered a country hitherto un- BooKlir.
known to the Spaniards, which he called Flo- I~
rida, either because he fell in with it on Palm
Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful
appearance. He attempted to land in different
places, but met with such vigorous opposition
from the natives, who were fierce and warlike,
as convinced him that an increase of force was
requisite to effeEt a settlement. Satisfied with
having opened a communication with a new
country, of whose value and importance he
conceived very sanguine hopes, he returned to
Puerto Rico, through the channel now known
by the name of the Gulf of Florida.

IT was not merely the passion of searching for

new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to
undertake this voyage, he was influenced by
one of those visionary ideas, which at that time
often mingled with the spirit of discovery, and
rendered it more aaive. A tradition prevailed
among the natives of Puerto Rico, that in the
file of Bimini, one of the Lucayos, there was a
fountain of such wonderful virtue as to renew
the youth, and recal the vigour of every per-
son who bathed in its salutary waters. In hopes
of finding this grand reflorative, Ponce de
Leon and his followers ranged through the
islands, i'arching, with fruitlels solicitude and

labour,

BooK IIl. labour, for the fountain, which was the chief

i~~?' object of their expedition. That a tale to fa-

bulous ffould gain credit among simple unin-
ftructed Indians is not furpriling. That it
should make any imprefiion upon an enlightened
people appears, in the present age, altogether
incredible. The fad, however, is certain; and
the most authentic Spanish historians mention
this extravagant rally of their credulous country-
men. The Spaniards, at that period, were en-
gaged in a career of activity which gave a ro-
mantic turn to their imagination, and daily pre-
sented to them strange and marvellous objects.
A New World was opened to their view. They
vifired islands and continents of whose exiflence
mankind in former ages had no conception.
In those delightful countries nature seemed to
assume another form; every tree and plant and
animal was diifferent from those of the ancient
hemisphere. They feerned to be transported
into enchanted ground; and, after the wonders
which they had leen, nothing, in the warmth
and novelty of their admiration, appeared to
them so extraordinary as to be beyond belief.
If the rapid fuccefi on of new and striking
Icenes made such impression even upon the
ibound underLtanding of Columbus, that he
bo.t!ted of having found the feat of Paradise, it
wili rn: ai-pear f£range that Ponce de Leon

should

flhould dream of discovering the fountain of BOOK III.,
youth i. -2.'

SooN after the expedition to Florida, a dif- Progress of

covery of much greater importance was made Bllb,, i.
in another part of America. Balboa having
been raised to the government of the small co-
lony at Santa Maria in Darien, by the volun-
tary suffrage of his associates, was so extremely
desirous to obtain from the crown a confirma-
tion of their election, that he dispatched one of
his officers to Spain, in order to solicit a royal
commiflion, which might invest him with a
legal title to the supreme command. Conscious,
however, that he could not expect success from
the patronage of Ferdinand's ministers, with
whom he was unconneted, or from negociating
in a court to the arts of which he was a ftran-
ger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity to
which he aspired, and aimed at performing
some signal service that would secure him the
preference to every competitor. Full of this
idea, he made frequent inroads into the adjacent
country, subdued several of the caziqucs, and

collected

BooK III. collected a considerable quantity of gold, which
11. abounded more in that part of the continent

than in the ifiands. In one of those excursions,
the Spaniards contended with such eagerness
about the division of some gold, that they were
at the point of proceeding to acts of violence
againil one another. A young cazique, who
was present, afronifhed at the high value which
they set upon a thing of which he did not dif-
cern the ule, tumbled the gold out of the ba-
lance with indignation ; anJ, turning to the
Spaniards, " Why do you quarrel (fays he)
about such a trifle ? If you are lb passionately
fond of gold, as to abandon your own country,
and ro diit urb the tranquillity of diltant nations
for i:s iake, I will conduct you to a region
w here the mieta! which Ceems to be the chief
ubiest of vy- adm;riration and dclirc, is so
common that ttie nieaneiL utensils are formed

t'oa and his comnpanions inquired eagerly where
h::is happy coun:rv lay, and how they- might
arri':c at it. He informed them that at the
a:ilance of i-:: funs, that is of fix davs journey

which they now appeared ·. 1^.

THIS was the first information which the The

Spaniards received concerning the great southern which he
ocean, or the opulent and extensive country
known afterwards by the name of Peru. Bal-
boa had now before him objects suited to his
boundless ambition, and the enterprising ar-
dour of his genius. He immediately concluded
the ocean which the cazique mentioned, to be
that for which Columbus had searched without
success in this part of America, in hopes of
opening a more direct communication with the
Eall Indies; and he conjectured that the rich
territory which had been described to him, muff
be part of that vailt and opulent region of the
earth. Elated with the idea of performing what
lb great a man had attempted in vain; and
cag:er to accomplifi a discovery which he knew
would be no less acceptable to the king than
beneficial to his country, he was impatient
until he could set out upon this enterprise, in
companiton of which all his former exploits ap-
peared inconsiderable. But previous arrange-
ment and preparation were requisite to ensure
!ucccfs. He began with courting and securing

,-"r,- He sent some of his officers to Hispaniola with

a large quantity of gold, as a proof of his past
success, and an earnest of his future hopes. By
a proper distribution of this, they secured the
favour of the governor, and allured volunteers

from that island joined him, and he thought

Di:5-Iy. c THE isthmus of Darien is not above sixty

miles in breadth i but this neck of land, which
binds tozether the continents of North and
South America, is strengthened by a chain of
lofty mountains stretching through its whole
extent, which render it a barrier of solidity sus-
ficient to refifx the impulse of two opposite
oceans. The mountains are covered with forests
almost inaccessible. The valleys in that moist
cli::z:e, where it rains during two-thirds of the
year, are marshy, and so frequently overflowed,
that the inh:bitan:s find it necessary, in many
places, to build their houses upon trees, in
order to be elevated at some distance from the

dering savages, the hand of industry had done pz,
nothing to mitigate or correct those natural dif-
advantages. To march across this unexplored
country, with no other guides but Indians,
whose fidelity could be little trusted, was, on all
those accounts, the boldest enterprise on which
the Spaniards had hitherto ventured in the New
World. But the intrepidity of Balboa was such
as distinguished him among his countrymen, at
a period when every adventurer was conspicuous 1513.
for daring courage. Nor was bravery his only
merit; he was pnrudent in conduct, generous,
affable, and possessed of those popular talents
which, in the most desperate undertakings,
inlpire confidence and secure attachment. Even
after the junction of the volunteers from His-
paniola, he was able to muster only an hundred
and ninety men for his expedition. But they
were hardy veterans, inured to the climate of
America, and ready to follow him through
every danger. A thousand Indians attended
them to carry their provisions; and to complete
h:eir warlike array, they took with them several
of thof: fierce dogs, which were no less formi-
dtlble than destructive to their naked enemies.

BooK III. that the periodical rains began to abate. He

_;_.. proceeded by sea, and without any difficulty,

to the territories of a cazique whose friendship
he had gained; but no sooner did he begin to
advance into the interior part of the country,
than he was retarded by every obstacle, which
he had reason to apprehend, from the nature of
the territory, or the disposition of its inhabit-
ants. Some of the caziques, at his approach,
fled to the mountrains with all their people, and
carried off or destroyed whatever could afford
fiubfifence to his troops. Others collec§ted their
iubjects, in order to oppose his progress, and
he quickly perceived what an arduous under-
taking it was, to conduct such a body of men
through hostile nations, across swamps and ri-
vers, and woods, which had never been pafied
btut by 2ragg!ing Innians. But by sharing in
every hardilhip with the meanerf soldier, by ap-

progress. But men who had surmounted so BooIK ur.
many obfLacles, despised the opposition of such 3
feeble enemies. They attacked them with im-
petuofity, and having dispersed them with
muIch eale and great slaughter, continued their
march. Though their guides had represented
the breadth of the isthmus to be only a journey
of fix -days, they had already spent twenty-five
in forcing their way through the woods and
mountains. Many of them were ready to fink
under such uninterrupted fatigue in that sultry
climate, several were seized with the diseases
peculiar to the country, and all became impa-
tient to reach the period of their labours and
f'li!ireings. At length the Indians assured them,
that from the top of the next mountain they
fihold ldiicover the ocean which was the ob ject
of their wishes. When, with infinite toil, they
haid climbed up the greater part of that steep
a cent, Balboa commanded his men to halt, and
ad:.inccd alone to the summit, that he might

!h had ob long desired. As soon as he beheld
the Sout h Sea ilretching in endless profpe&t be-
lowc him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up
his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God,
who had conducted him to a discovery so bene-
tic..l to his country, and so honourable to him-
ei". Hi-i followers, observing his transports

course to the shore with great alacrity, when
Balboa advancing up to the middle in the
waves with his buckler and sword, took pof-
fefflon of that ocean in the name of the king
his matiler, and vowed to defend it, with these
arms, against all his enemies'.

THAT part of the great Pacific or Southern

ocean, which Balboa first discovered, frill re-
tains the name of the Gulf of St. Michael,
which he gave to it, and is situated to the eaff
of Panama. From several of the petty princes,
who governed in the diftrifts adjacent to that
gulf, he extorted provisions and gold by force
of arms. Others sent them to him voluntarily.
To there acceptable presents, some of the
caziques added a considerable quantity of
pearls; and he learned from them, with much
fatisfafion, that pearl oyflers abounded in the
fca which he had newly discovered.

his sanguine hopes of future and more extensive B6oo- tL.
benefits from the expedition. All the people .
on the coast of the South Sea concurred in in-
forming him that there was a mighty and opu-
lent kingdom situated at a cetfiderable distance
towards the south-east, the inhabitants of which
had tame animals to carry their burdens. In
order to give them an idea of there, they drew
upon the sand the figure of the Llamas or Iheep,
afterwards found in Peru, which the Peruvians
had taught to perform such services as they
described. As the Llama, in its form, nearly
resembles a camel, a beast of burden deemed
peculiar to Asia, this circumstance, in con.
junction with the discovery of the pearls, ano-
ther noted production of that country, tended
to confirm the Spaniards in their mistaken
theory with refpea to the vicinity of the New
World to the East Indies d

BUT though the information which Balboa Obged to

received from the people on the coast, as well
as his own conjectures and hopes, rendered him
extremely impatient to visit this unknown
countryv, his prudence refrained him from at-
rempting to invade it with an handful of men,

In order to acquire a more extensive knowledge

route, which he found to be no less dangerous
and difficult than that which he had formerly
taken. But to men elated with success, and
animated with hope, nothing is infurmount-

niards had acquired in any expedition in the

a thousand men, in order to attempt the con- BooKIIL
queftl of that opulent country, concerning which ,.
he had received such inviting intelligence.
The firfl account of the discovery of the New
World hardly occasioned greater joy, than the
unexpected tidings, that a passage was at last
found to the great southern ocean. The conm-
munication with the East Indies, by a courlie
to the westward of the line of demarcation,
drawn by the Pope, seemed now to be certain.
The valt wealth which flowed into Portugal
from its settlements and conquests in that
country, excited the envy and called forth the
emulation of other flates. Ferdinand hoped
now to come in for a share in this lucrative
commerce, and in his eagerness to obtain it,
was willing to make an effort beyond whaq
Balboa required. But even in this exertion,
his jealous policy, as well as the fatal antipathy
of Fonseca, now bishop of Burgos, to every
man of merit who distinguished himself in the
New World, were conspicuous. Not with-
ltanding Balboa's recent services, which marked
him out as the mofl proper person to finifli
tihat great undertaking which he had begun,
Ferdinand was so ungenerous as to overlook
tli:.lfe, and to appoint Pedrarias Davila governor
cf Darien. l-e gave him the command of
fifteen fltout vcffcls, and twelve hundred fol-

BoKi mI. diers. These were fitted out at the public

expence, with a liberality which Ferdinand
had never difplaved in any former armament
destined for the New World; and such was the
ardour of the Spanish gentlemen to follow a
leader who was about to conduct them to a
country, where, as fame reported, they had
only to throw their nets into the sea and draw
out gold ', that fifteen hundred embarked on
board the fleet, and if they had not been re-
firained, a much greater number would have
engaged in the service b.

PEDRARIAS reached the gulf of Darien with-

out any remarkable accident, and immediately
sent some of his principal officers ashore, to
inform Balboa of his arrival, with the king's
commiflion, to be governor of the colony. To
their astonishment, they found Balboa, of whose
great exploits they had heard so much, and
of whose opulence they had formed such high
ideas, clad in a canvas jacket, and wearing
coarse hempen sandals used only by the meanest
peasants, employed together with some In-
dians, in thatching his own hut with reeds.
Even in this simple garb, which corresponded

so

so ill with the expecations and wilhes of his BooKslI.
new guests, Balboa received them with dig- L-
nity. The fame of his discoveries had drawn
So many adventurers from the islands, that he
could now muster four hundred and fifty men.
At the head of those daring veterans, he was
more than a match for the forces which Pedra-
rias brought with him. But though his troops
murmured loudly at the injustice of the king
in superseding their commander, and com-.
plained that strangers would now reap the
fruits of their toil and success, Balboa sub-
mitted with implicit obedience to the will of
his Sovereign, and received Pedrarias with all
the deference due to his character'.

NOTWITHSTANPING this moderation towhich Difrention

Pedrarias owed the peaceable poffellTon of his bitw.nd
government, he appointed a judicial inquiry Bal~ioa.
to be made into Balboa's conduct, while under
the command of Nicueffa, and imposed a con-
fiderable fine upon him, on account of the
irregularities of which he had then been guilty.
Balboa felt sensibly the mortification of being
subjected to trial and to punishment in a place
where he had so lately occupied the first station.
Pedrarias could not conceal his jealousy of his

, .z one, and the .envy of the other, gave rife to

diTentions extremely detrimental to the.colony.
It was threatened with a calamity still more
J-'.- fatal. Pedrarias had landed in Darien at a

moit unlucky time of the year, about the
nniddle of the rainy season, in that part of the
turrnd zone where the clouds pour down such
torrents as are unknown in more temperate
climaces'. The village of Santa Maria was
feated in a rich plain, environerd with marshes
and wvods. The conflitution of Europeans
was unablk to withstand the pestilential in-
Rficnce of such a situation, in a climate natu-
rally fb noxious, and at a season so peculiarly
uiheair,.y. A violent and deftruc'ive malady
carried off many of the soldiers who accompa-
nied Pedrarias. An extreme fcarciry of pro-
visions augmented this distress, as ir rendered
it impossible to find proper refreshment for the
sick, or the necessary sustenance for the healthy'.
In the space of a month, above fix hundred
persons perished in the utmost misery. De-
jection and despair spread through the colony.
Many principal persons solicited their difinif-
s.on, and were glad to relinquish all their hopes

of

of wealth, in order to escape from that perni- BooK Ile.
cious region. Pedrarias endeavoured to divert ,x.
those who remained from brooding over their
misfortunes, by finding them employment.
With this view, he sent several detachments
into the interior parts of the country, to levy
gold among the natives, and to search for the
mines in which it was produced. Those rapa-
cious adventurers, more attentive to present
gain than to the means of facilitating their
future progress, plundered without diftinctidn
wherever they marched. Regardless of the
alliances which Balboa had made with several
of the caziques, they stripped them of every
thing valuable, and treated them, as well as
their flub jeas, with the utmost insolence and
cruelty. By their tyranny and exactions, which
Pedrarias, either fi-om want of authority or of
inclination, did not restrain, all the country
from the gulf of Darien to the lake of Nica-
rasgua was desolated, and the Spaniards were
inconsiderately deprived of the advantages
which they might have derived from the friend-
ship of the natives, in extending their conquests
to the South Sea. Balboa, who saw with con-
cern that fuch-ill-judged proceedings retarded
the execution of his favourite scheme, sent
violent remonfirances to Spain against the im-
prudent government of Pedrarias, which had

ruined

Boor III. ruined a happy and flourifhling colony. Pe-

'"' drarias, on the other hand, accused him of

having deceived the king, by magnifying his
own exploits, as well as by a false reprefenta-
ton of the opulence and value of the country a.

iolent p- FERDINAND became sensible at length of his
-i,'. nl- imprudence in superseding the most active and
!bea experienced officer he had in the New World,

and, by way of compensation to Balboa, ap-
pointed him Addelanado, or Lieutenant-gover-
nor of the countries upon the South Sea, with
very extensive privileges and authority. At
the fame time he enjoined Pedrarias to support
Balboa in all his operations, and to consult
with him concerning every measure which he
5ss'. himself pursued. But to effect such a sudden

transition from inveterate enmity to perse&
confidence, exceeded Ferdinand's power. Pe-
drarias continued to treat his rival with neg-
lec; and Balboa's fortune being exhausted by
the payment of his fine, and other exactions
of Pedrarias, he could not make suitable pre-
parations for taking possession of his new go-
vernment. At length, by the interposition
and exhortations of the bishop of Darien, they

were

were brought to a reconciliation; and, in order Book IIr.
to cement this union more firmly, Pedrarias ,5
agreed to give his daughter in marriage to
Balboa. The first effect of their concord was, 1s6.
that Balboa was permitted to make several
linall incursions into the country. These he
conducted with such prudence, as added to the
reputation which he had already acquired.
Many adventurers retorted to him, and, with
the countenance and aid of Pedrarias, he began
to prepare for his expedition to the South Sea.
In order to accomplish this, it was neceffarv to
build vessels capable of conveying his troops to
those provinces which he purposed to invade.
After surmounting many obstacles, and endur- 1517.
ing a variety of those hardships which were
the portion of the conquerors of America, he
at length finished four small brigantines. In
there, with three hundred chosen men, a force
superior to that with which Pizarro afterwards
undertook the fame expedition, he was ready
to fail towards Peru, when he received an un-
expected message from Pedrarias . As his re-
conciliation with Balboa had never been cor-
dial, the progress which he made revived his
ancient enmity, and added to its rancour. He
dreaded the prosperity and elevation of a man

that success would encourage him to aim at in-
dependence upon his jurifdicion; and so vio-
lently did the passions of hatred, fear, and jea-
loufv, operate upon his mind, that, in order
to gratify his vengeance, he scrupled not to
defeat an enterprise of the greatest moment to
his country'. Under pretexts which were false,
but plausible, 'he desired Balboa to postpone
his vovage for a short time, and to repair to
Acda, in order that he might have an inter-
view with him. Balboa, with the unfulpicious
confidence of a man conscious of no crime, in-
fLantly obeyed the summons; but as soon as he
entered the place, he was arrested by order of
Pedrarias, whose impatience to satiate his re-
-vnge did not susser him to languilh long in
confinement. Judges were immediately ap-
pointed to proceed to his trial. An accusation
of diioyalty to the king, and of an intention
to revolt against the governor, was preferred
againl him. Sentence of death was pro-
nounced; and though the judges who passed
it, seconded by the whole colonv, interceded
warmly for his pardon, Pcdrarias continued
inexorable i and the Spaniards beheld, with
aftonilhment and sorrow, the public execution
of a man whon they univerlally deemed more
caoable than any who had borne command in

justice of his proceedings, was not only screened:
from punilihment by the powerful patronage
of the bisho.p of Burgos and other courtiers,.
but continued in power. Soon after, he ob-
tained permission to remove the colony from
its unwholesome ifation at Santa Maria to
Panama, on the opposite fide of the isthmus;
and though it did not gain much in point of
healthfulness by the change, the commodious
situation of this new iettlement contributed
greatly to facilitate the subsequent conquests

fifteen,

Boor Ill. fifteen, he fitted out two ships at his own ex-

^s 7, pence, in order to attempt such a voyage, and

gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de
Solis, who was deemed one of the most fiilful
navigators in Spain. He stood along the coast
of South America, and, on the first of January
one thousand five hundred and sixteen, entered
a river, which he called Janeiro, where an ex-
tensive commerce is now carried on. From
thence he proceeded to a spacious bay, which
he supposed to be the entrance into a strait that
communicated with the Indian ocean; but up-
on advancing farther, he found it to be the
mouth of Rio de Plata, one of the vast rivers
by which the southern continent of America is
watered. In endeavouring to make a descent
in this country, De Solis and several of his
crew were slain by the natives, who, in fight
of the ships, cut their bodies in pieces, roasted
and devoured them. Discouraged with the
loss of their commander, and terrified at this
shocking fpe&acle, the surviving Spaniards set
fail for Europe, without aiming at any farther
diicovery q. Though this attempt proved abor-
tive, it was not without benefit. It turned
the attention of ingenious men to this course
of navigation, and prepared the way for a more

fortunate

fortunate voyage, in which, a few years pofte- B6oK IIL
rior to this period, the great design that Ferdi- si?
nand had in view was accomplished.

THOUGH the Spaniards were. thus actively Stteofrth,

employed in extending their discoveries and HZisp.lo.
settlements in America, they frill confidered
Hispaniola as their principal colony, and the
feat of government. Don Diego Columbus
wanted neither inclination nor abilities to have
rendered the members of this colony, who were
most immediately under his jurifdidion, profpe-
rous and happy. But he was circumscribed in
all his operations by the suspicious policy of
Ferdinand, who on every occasion, and under
pretexts the most frivolous, retrenched his pri-
vileges, and encouraged the treasurer, the
judges, and other Subordinate officers, to coun-
teraat his measures, and to dispute his autho-
rity. The most valuable prerogative which
the governor possessed, was that of distributing
Indians among the Spaniards fettled in the
island. The rigorous servitude of those un-
happy men having been but little mitigated by
all the regulations in their favour, the power
of parcelling out such necessary inflruments cf
labour at pleasure, secured to the governor
great influence in the colony. In order to
itrip him of this, Ferdinand created a new

office,

Boos I1T. office, with the power of difhributing the In-,

,'-, dians, and bestowed it upon Rodrigo Albu-

querque, a relation of Zapata, his confidential
minister. Mortified with the injuffice, as well
at indignity, of this invasion upon. his rights,
in a point so essential, Don Diego could no
longer remain in a place where his power and
consequence were almost annihilated. He re-
paired to Spain with the vain hopes of obtain-
ing redress . Albuquerque entered upon his
onice with all the rapacity of an indigent ad-
venturer, impatient to amass wealth. He
began with taking the exact number of Indians
in the island, and found, that from sixty thou-
sand, who, in the year one thousand five hun-
dred and eight, survived after all their susser-
ings, they were now reduced to fourteen thou-
sand. These he threw into separate divisions
or lots, and bestowed them upon such as were
willing to purchase them at the highest price.
By this arbitrary diilriburion, several of the
natives were removed from their original habi-
tations, nany were taken from their ancient
mafrers, and al! of them fubjefted to heavier
burdens, and to more intolerable labour, in
order to reimburse their new proprietors.
Those additional calamities completed the

i-i'frer

misery, and hastened on the extinction of this Boox 1T.
wretched and innocent race of men . 157

them, not only excited complaints among such mn't . .

as thought themselves aggrieved, but touched
the hearts of all who retained any sentiments
of humanity. From the time that Ecclesiastics
were lent as inftruaors into America, they
perceived that the rigour with which their
countrymen treated the natives, rendered their
miiniftry altogether fruitless. The millionaries,
in conformity to the mild spirit of that religion
which they were employed to publish, early
remonifrated against the maxims of the planters
with refpe&t to the Americans, and condemned
the rcpartinmientos, or difiributions, by which
they were given up as slaves to their con-
querors, as no less contrary to natural justice
and the precepts of Christianity, than to found
pt)licy. The Dominicans, to whom the in-
l.ru&Lion of the Americans was originally com-
mitted, were most vehement in testifying against
the repartimientos. In the year one thousand

their most eminent preachers, inveighed -igainit

sacraments, such of their countrymen as held BooK III.
the natives in servitude . Both parties applied t --
to the king for his decision in a matter of such
importance. Ferdinand empowered a com-
mittee of his privy-council, assisted by some of
the most eminent civilians and divines in Spain,
to hear the deputies sent from Hi1paniola, in
support of their refpeaive opinions. After a
long difcufilon, the speculative point in con-
troverfy was determined in favour of the Do-
minicans, the Indians were declared to be a
firee people, intitled to all the natural rights of
men; but, notwithstanding this decision, the
repartimiieintos were continued upon their ancient
footing ". As this determination admitted the
principle upon which the Dominicans founded
their opinion, it was not calculated either to
silence or to convince them. At length, in
order to quiet the colony, which was alarmed
lv their remonstrances and censures, Ferdinand
ii'cd a decree of his privy-council, declaring,
that after mature consideration of the Apostolic

natives as were not hitherto corrupted by the
example of the Spaniards, or alienated by their

BooK II. promised to take into attentive consideration
,517. the means of redressing the evil of which he

complained. But death prevented him from
executing his resolution. Charles of Austria,
to whom all his crowns devolved, resided at
that time in his paternal dominions in the Low
Countries. Las Casas, with his usual ardour,
prepared immediately to set out for Slanders,
in order to occupy the ear of the young mo-
narch, when cardinal Ximenes, who, as regent,
assumed the reins of government in Castile,
commanded him to desist from the .journey, and
engaged to hear his complaints in person.

Tr.h-it'. HE accordingly weighed the mnatter with
c. -, x, attention equal to its importance; and as his
.:... impetuous mind delighted in schemes bold and

uncommon, he soon fixed upon a plan which
astonished the ministers, trained up under the
formal and cautious administration of Ferdi-
nand. Without regarding either the rights of
Don Diego Columbus, or the regulations efta-
blifhed by the late king, he resolved to fend
three persons to America as superintendents of
all the colonies there, with authority, after
examining all circumnftances on the spot, to de-
cide finally with refpea to the point in question.
It was a matter of deliberation and delicacy
to chute men qualified for such an important

station.

flation. As all the laymen fettled in America, BOOK III.
or who had been consulted in the adminiftra- 5,7
tion of that department, had given their opinion
that the Spaniards could not keep possession
of their new settlements, unless they were al-
lowed to retain their dominion over the In-
dians, he saw that he could not rely on their
impartiality, and determined to commit the
truit to ecclesiastics. As the Dominicans and
Franciscans had already espoused opposite fides
in the controversy, he, from the fame prin-
ciple, excluded both there fraternities from the
commiTion. He confined his choice to the
mon-ks of St. Jerome, a small, but refpeftable
order in Spain. With the assistance of their
general, and in concert with Las Casas, he soon
pitched upon three persons whom he deemed
equal to the charge. To them he joined
Zuazo, a private lawyer of distinguished pro-
bity, with unbounded power to regulate all
judicial proceedings in the colonies. Las Casas
was appointed to accompany them, with the
title of Protector of the Indians :.

a miatu.re confirieration of the whole, they were
f!llv satisfied that the state of the colony rcen-
d'rcJi it impoffTible to adopt the plan proposed
by I.,.is Casas, and recommended by the car-
dnal. They plainly perceived that the Spa-
ni.ird fettled in America were so few in num-
ber, that they could neither work the mines
which had been opened, nor cultivate the coun-
try ; that they depended for both upon the
labour of the natives, and if deprived of it, they
m11ui: inlantly relinquish their conquests, or
give iup all the advantages which they derived
from them ; that no allurement was so power-
ful as to surmount the natural aversion of the
Indians to any laborious effort, and that no-
thing but the authority of a mafler could com-
pel them to work; and if they were not kept
conflrntly under the eye and dif:ipline of a
ful erior, so great was their natural li'llefTilfs
and indifference, that they would ncither attend
to religious inftrul'ion, nor observe those rites
of Chrifianity which they had been already

taught.

intendents found it necessary to tolerate the
repartimnientos, and to susser the Indians to re-
main under subjection to their Spanish masters.
They used their utmost endeavours, however,
to prevent the fatal effects of this establishment,
and to secure the Indians the consolation of the
best treatment compatible with a state of ser-
vitude. For this purpose, they revived former
regulations, they prescribed new ones, they
neglected no circumstance that tended to miti-
gate the rigour of the yoke; and by their
authority, their example, and their exhorta-
tions, they laboured to inspire their country-
men with sentiments of equity and gentleness
towards the unhappy people upon whose in-
duilrv they depended. Zuazo, in his depart-
ment, seconded the endeavours of the fuperin-
tendents. He reformed the courts of justice,
in such a manner as to render their decisions
equitable as well as expeditious, and intro-
duced various regulations which greatly im-
proved the interior police of the colony. The
satisfacTion which his conduct, and that of the
superintendents gave, was now universal among
the Spaniards fettled in the New \orld, and
all admired the boldness of Ximenes, in hav-
ing departed from the ordinary path of business
in formin, his plan, as well as his sagacity, in

LAS CASAS alone was dissatisfied. The pru- Las Casas

dential considerations which influenced the with thm.

He regarded their idea of accommodating their
conduct to the state of the colony, as the maxim
ot an unhallowed timid policy, which tole-
rated what was unjust, because it was benefi-
cial. He contended, that the Indians were
by nature free, and, as their protector, he re-
quired the superintendents not to bereave
them of the common privilege of humanity.
They received his most virulent remonftranccs
without emotion, but adhered firmly to their
own IRftem. The Spanifl planters did not
bear with him so patiently, and were ready to
tear him in pieces for infilling in a requisition
ob odious to them. Las Casas, in order to
Icreen himself from their rage, found it necef-
lary to take ihelter in a convent; and perceiv-
ing that all his efforts in America were fruitless,
le loon let out for Europe, with a fixed refu-
lutio;i not to abandon the protection of a people
wv.hoin he deemed to be cruelly oppressed '.

and addrets. He courted the Flemiflh ministers Booi Itt.
with afliduity. He repre!'nted to them the ab- 7
furdity of all the maxims hitherto adopted with
refpecl to the government of America, and par-
ticularly the defects of that arrangement which
Ximenes had introduced. The memory of
Ferdinand was odious to the Flemings. The
flperior virtue and abilities of Ximenes had
long been the object of their envy. They
fondly wifhled to have a plausible pretext for
condemning the measures, both of the mo-
narch and of the minister, and of reflecting
Ibme difcrc.lit on their political wisdom. The
friends of ])on Diego Columbus, as well as the
Spanilh courtiers, who had been dissatisfied
with the cardinal's administration, joined Las
Cal:as in censuring the scheme of fending fu-
perintendents to America. This union of so
many interelts and paflions was irresistible; and,
in conlequence of it, the fathers of St. Jerome,
and their aflociate Zuazo, were recalled. Ro-
derigo de Figueroa, a lawyer of some eminence,
X.as appointed chief judge of the island, and re-
ccived infl-rucions, in compliance with the re-
quiietl of Las Casas, to examine once more, with
the utmost attention, the point in controversy
between him and the people of the colony, with
re-lpcit to the treatment of the natives; and in
the i.mean time to do every thing in his power to

s.he .- Cf THIS was all that the zeal of Las Casas could

procure, at that junclure, in favour of the In-
.'...-- dians. The impoflibility of carrying on any

improvement in America, unless the Spanish
planters could command the labour of the na-
tives, was an insuperable objection to his plan
of treating them as free fubjeats. In order to
provide some remedy for this, without which
he found it was in vain to mention his scheme,
Las Casas proposed to purchase a sufficient
number of negroes from the Portuguese fettle-
ments on the coast of Africa, and to transport
them to America, in order that they might be
employed as slaves in working the mines and
c'ultivating the ground. One of the first ad-
van: ces which the Portuguese had derived
s;-o'n their discoveries in Africa, aro'e from the
trad: in Plaves. Various circumstances concurred
in reviving this odious commerce, which had
b I-n long aboiilhed in Europe, and which is
ro leis repugnant to the feelings of humanity,
than to the principles of religion. As early as
the year one thousand five hundred and three,
a few negro haves had been lent into the New

YWorld k. In the year one thousand five hundred BooK III.
and eleven, Ferdinand permitted the importa- ,.
tion of them in greater numbers '. They were
found to be a more robust and hardy race than
the natives of America. They were more ca-
pable of enduring fatigue, more patient under
servitude, and the labour of one negro was
computed to be equal to that of four Indians".
Cardinal Ximenes, however, when solicited to
encourage this commerce, peremptorily re-
jected the proposition, because he perceived the
iniquity of reducing one race of men to slavery,
while he was consulting about the means of re-
storing liberty to another :. But Las Casas,
from the inconsistency natural to men who
hurry with headlong impetuosity towards a fa-
vourite point, was incapable of making this
diltinCtion. While he contended earnestly for
the liberty of the people born in one quarter of
the globe, he laboured to enslave the inhabit-
ants of another region; and in the warmth of
his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke,
pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to
inmpole one still heavier upon the Africans.
Unfortunately for the latter, Las Cafas's plan
was adopted. Charles granted a patent to one

noefe merchants for twenty-five thousand du-
eats, and they were the first who brought into
a regular form that commerce for slaves between
Africa and America, which has since been car-
ried on to such apn amazing extent°.

-.,L. BUT the Genoese merchants, conducting

-' -.k. their operations, at first, with the rapacity of
-- ..o. rr monopolists, demanded such an high price for

: c..:neroes, that the number imported into Hifpa-

niola made no great change upon the (fate of
she coionv. Las Casas, whose zeal was no less
inventive than indefatigable, had recourse to
another expedient for the relief of the Indians.
He observed, th?.t most of the perfors who had
fettled hithtrto in America, were soldiers and
sailors emplovye in the diiovery or conquest
of the co'-ntrv- t'.e younger ions of noble fa-
milies, allured by the prospect of acquiring

forming new colonies, he proposed to supply tooK III.
the new settlements in Hispaniola and the other .-.
islands with a sufficient number of labourers and
hujbandmen, who should be allured by suitable
premiums to remove thither. These, as they
were accustomed to fatigue, would be able to
perform the work, to which the Indians, from
the feebleness of their conffitution, were une-
qual, and might soon become useful and opu-
lent citizens. But though Hispaniola flood
much in need of a recruit of inhabitants, having
been visited at this time with the fiall-pox,
which swept off many of the natives, and though
Las Casas had the countenance of the Flemish
ministers, this scheme was defeated by the
bishop of Burgos, -who thwarted all his pro-
jeas P.

LAS CASAs now despaired of procuring any Forms the

relief for the Indians in those places where the ndew.clony.
Spaniards were already fettled. The evil was
become so inveterate there, as not to admit of
a cure. But such discoveries were daily making
in the continent, as gave an high idea both of
its extent and populousness. In all those vast
regions there was but one feeble colony planted;
and except a small spot on the isthmus of Da-

Boc: ill. rien, the natives still occupied the whole coun-

for the humanity and zeal of Las Casas, who
flattered himself that he might prevent a perni-
ciaus fvftem from being introduced there,
though he had failed of success in his attempts
to overturn it, where it was already established.
Full of this idea, he applied for a grant of the
unoccupied country, stretching along the sea-
coast from the gulf of Paria to the western fron-
tier of that province now known by the name
of Santa Martha. He proposed to fettle there
with a colony composed of husbandmen, la-
bourers, and ecclesiastics. He engaged, in
the ipace of two years, to civilize ten thousand
of the natives, and to instruct them so thoroughly
in the arts of social life, that, from the fruits
of their industry, an annual revenue of fifteen
thoui-ind ducats should arise to the king. In
ten years he expected that his improvements
would be so far advanced, as to yield annually
i;xtv thousa:nd ducats. He stipulated, that no
Tailoor or soldier should ever be permitted to
ie:;le in this diflrit;, and that -no Spaniard
!]:ou!L, enccr it without his permifiion. He
tven projected to clothe the people whom he
toul along with him in some peculiar garment,
vwhch di;d not resemble the Spanish dress, that
the- nm:g.h: ppear to the natives to be a dif-

fcrent

ferent race of men from those who had brought BOOK III.
so many calamities upon their country q. From ,1,7.
this scheme, of which I have traced only the
great lines, it is manifest that Las Casas had
formed ideas concerning the method of treating
the Indians, similar to those by which the Je-
lulits afterwards carried on their great opera-
tions in another part of the fame continent. He
supposed that the Europeans, by availing them-
selves of that ascendant which they possessed in
consequence of their superior progress in science
and improvement, might gradually form the
minds of the Americans to relish those comforts
of which they were destitute, might train them
to the arts of civil life, and render them ca-
pable of its functions.

BUT to the bishop of Burgos and the council FavinrI'y

of the Indies this project appeared not only
chimerical, but dangerous in a high degree.
They deemed the faculties of the Americans to
be naturally so limited, and their indolence so
excclfive, that any attempt to instruct or im-
prove them would be fruitless. They contended,
that it would be extremely imprudent to give
thic command of a country extending above a
th'oufind miles along the coast, to a fanciful,

EBoK III. presumptuous enthusiast, a firanger to the as-

,;,. fairs of the world, and unacquainted with the

arts of government. Las Casas, far from being
discouraged with a repulse, which he had reason
to expect, had recourse once more to the Fle-
mi.fh favourites, who zealously patronized his
scheme, merely because it had been rejected by
the Spanish minifrers. They prevailed with
their master, who had lately been raised to the
Imperial dignity, to refer the consideration of
this measure to a select number of his privy-
counfeilors; and as Las Casas excepted against
the members of the council of the Indies, as
partial and interested, they were all excluded.
The decision of men chosen by recommendation
of the Flemings, was perfectly conformable to
their sentiments. They warmly approved of
Las Cafas's plan; and gave orders for carrying
it into execution, but restricted the territory
alto-ted him to three hundred miles along the
coast of Cumana, allowing him, however, to
extend it as far as he pleased towards the in-
terior part of the country '.

Indies

Indies exclaimed against it, and supported their BooK III.
opinion to confidently, and with such plausible '.
reasons, as made it advisable to pause and to
review the fubje& more deliberately. Charles
himtelf, though accustomed, at this early pe-
riod of his life, to adopt the tentiments of his
minilters, with such submissive deference as did
not promise that decisive vigour of mind which
dilflinguifhed his riper years, could not help
fulfpeting that the eagerness with which the Fle-
mings took part in every affair relating to Ame-
rica, flowed from some improper motive, and
began to discover an inclination to examine in
person into the state of the question concerning
the charafter of the Americans, and the proper
manner of treating them. An opportunity of June 2o.
making this inquiry, with great advantage, soon
occurred. Quevedo, the bishop of Darien,
who had accompanied Pedrarias to the conti-
nent in the year one thousand five hundred and
thirteen, happened to land at Barcelona, where
the court then resided. It was quickly known,
that his sentiments concerning the talents and
disposition of the Indians differed from those of
Las Casas; and Charles naturally concluded,
that by confronting two refpeatable persons,
who, during their residence in America, had
full leisure to observe the manners of the people

Y 4 whom

Boo III. whom they pretended to describe, he might be

,51,. able to discover which of them had formed his

opinion with the greatest discernment and ac-
curacv.

A DAY for this solemn audience was ap-

pointed. The emperor appeared with extraor-
dinary pomp, and took his feat on a throne in
the great hall of the palace. His principal
courtiers attended. Don Diego Columbus,
admiral of the Indies, was summoned to be
present. The bishop of Darien was called upon
first to deliver his opinion. He, in a short dif-
course, lamented the fatal desolation of America,
by the extinction of so many of its inhabitants;
he acknowledged that this must be imputed, in
fuome degree, to the excelfive rigour and incon-
fiderate proceedings of the Spaniards; but de-
clared, that all the people of the New World,
whom he had seen either in the continent or in
the islands, appeared to him to be a race of
men marked out, by the inferiority of their ta-
lents, for servitude, and whom it would be im-
pon ible to instruCt or improve, unless they were
kept under the continual infpe&ion of a matter.
Las Casas, at greater length, and with more
fervour, defended his own system. He rejected
with indignation the idea that any race of men

was

was born to servitude, as irreligious and inhu- BOOK III.
mane. He asserted, that the faculties of the ~,
Americans were not naturally despicable, but
unimproved; that they were capable of re-
ceiving inftruaion in the principles of religion,
as well as of acquiring the industry and arts
which would qualify them for the various offices
of social life; that the mildness and timidity of
their nature rendered them to submissive and
docile, that they might be led and formed with
a gentle hand. He professed, that his inten-
tions in proposing the scheme now under con-
fideration were pure and disinterested ; and
though, from the accomplishment of his de-
signs, inefrimable benefits would result to the
crown of Castile, he never had claimed, nor

CHARLES, after hearing both, and consulting Th, fce.me

with his ministers, did not think himself fuffi- caas P-
ciently informed to establish any general ar- iprod of
rangement with refpe&c to the state of the In-
dians ; but as he had perfect confidence in the
integrity of Las Casas, and as even the bifflop
of Darien admitted his scheme to be of lfuch
importance, that a trial should be made of its
cffects, he issued a patent, granting him the
district in Cumaaa formerly mentioned, with

full

Boo~ 1I1. full power to establish a colony there according

,s,-. to his own plan'.

. i-;-.... LAS CASAS pushed on the preparations for
', .' . his voyage with his usual ardour. But, either

from his own inexperience in the conduct of
affairs, or from the secret opposition of the
Spanish nobility, who universally dreaded the
success of an institution that might rob them of
the industrious and useful hands which culti-
vated their estates, his progress in engaging
hufhandmen and labourers was extremely flow,
and he could not prevail on more than two
hundred to accompany him to Cumana.

Ce~- o. " poioiflieon of such a vast territory, and altogether

l nequal to any attempt towards civilizing its
inlhbitants, he set Ai.il. The first place at which
he touched was the ifand of Puerto Rico.
There he received an account of a new obstacle
to the execution of his scheme, more insuperable
th-an any he ha.J hitherto encountercd. When

rien. But as every species of internal industry
began to flagnate in Hispaniola, when, by the
rapid decrease of the natives, the Spaniards
were deprived of those hands with which they
had hitherto carried on their operations, this
prompted them to try various expedients for
supplying that loss. Considerable numbers of
negroes were imported; but, on account of
their exorbitant price, many of the planters
could not afford to purchase them. In order
to procure slaves at an easier rate, some of these
fitted out vessels to cruize along the coast of the
continent. In places where they found them-
selves inferior in strength, they traded with the
natives, and gave European toys in exchange
for the plates of gold worn by them as orna-
ments; but, wherever they could surprise or
overpower the Indians, they carried them off
by force, and fold them as slaves in Hispaniola'.
In those predatory excursions, the most atro-
cious acts of violence and cruelty were com-
mitted. The Spanish name was held in de-
teitation all over the continent. Whenever
any flips appeared, the inhabitants either fled

tranquillity. They forced some parties of the
Spaniards to retreat with precipitation; they
cut off others; and in the violence of their re-
fentment against the whole nation, they mur-
dered two Dominican mifiionaries, whose zeal
had prompted them to fettle in the province of
Cumana °. This outrage against persons re-
vered for their sanctity, excited such indigna-
tion among the people of Hispaniola, who,
notwithstanding all their licentious and cruel
proceedings, were possessed with a wonderful
zeal for religion, and a superstitious refpeat for
its ministers, that they determined to inflift
exemplary punishment, not only upon the per-
petrators of that crime, but upon the whole
race. With this view, they gave the command
of five Ihips and three hundred men to Diego
Ocampo, with orders to lay waste the country
of Cumana with fire and sword, and to tranf-
port all the inhabitants as slaves to Hispaniola.
This armament Las Casas found at Puerto
Rico, in its way to the continent; and as
Ocampo refused to defer his voyage, he imme-

i:ately perceived that it would be impossible to
ateinip; the execution of his pacific plan in a

among the planters in Puerto Rico. From
many concurring causes, the reception which
Las Casas met with in Hispaniola was very un-
favourable. In his negociations for the relief
of the Indians, he had censured the conduct of
his countrymen fettled there with such honest
severity, as rendered him universally odious to
them. They confidered their own ruin as the
inevitable consequence of his success. They
were now elated with hope of receiving a large
recruit of slaves from Cumana, which must be
relinquished if Las Casas were assisted in fettling
his projccted colony there. Figueroa, in con-
sequence of the instructions he had received in
Spain, had made an experiment concerning the
capacity of the Indians, which was represented
as decisive against the system of Las Casas. He
collected in Hispaniola a good number of the
natives, and fettled them in two villages, leav-
ing them at perfect liberty, and with the uncon-
trouled direction of their own actions. But

commifion in that province with such bar- 517,
barous rage, having massacred many of the in-
habitants, sent others in chains to Hispaniola,
and forced the reft to fly for flelter to the
woods, that the people of a finall colony, which
he had planted at a place which he named STo-
ledo, were ready to perish for want in a defo-
lated country. There, however, Las Casas
was obliged to fix his residence, though de-
ferted both by the troops appointed to protect
him, and by those under the command of
Ocampo, who foresaw and dreaded the calami-
ties to which he must be exposed in that
wretched station. He made the best provision
in his power for the safety and subsistence of his
followers; but as his utmost efforts availed little
towards securing either the one or the other, he
returned to Hispaniola, in order to solicit more
effectual aid for the preservation of men, who
from confidence in him had ventured into a post
of so much danger. Soon after his departure,
the natives, having discovered the feeble and
defenceless state of the Spaniards, assembled
fecretlyv, attacked them with the fury natural
to men exasperated by many injuries, cut off a
good number, and compelled the reft to fly in
the utmost consternation to the island of Cuba-
gua. The finall colony fettled there, on ac-

count

Boor III. count of the pearl filhery, catching the panic
1~~ with which their countrymen had been seized,

abandoned the island, and not a Spaniard re-
mained in any part of the continent, or adjacent
islands, from the gulf of Paria to the borders
of Darien. Astonished at such a succession of
disasters, Las Casas was ashamed to shew his
face after this fatal termination of all his fplen-
did schemes. He shut himnfelf up in the con-
vent of the Dominicans at St. Domingo, and
soon after assumed the habit of that order Z.

the progress of Las Cafas's negociations from
their firit rife to their final issue without inter-

from the malevolent opposition of his adver-

ro the history of the Spanish discoveriess as.they
occur in the order of timea.

DIEGO VELASQUEZ, who conquered Cuba in New dico-

the year one thousand five hundred and elevens ward ito-
f1ill retained the government of that island, as wetl.
the deputy of Don Diego Columbus, though
he seldom adknowledged his superior, and
aimed at rendering his own authority altogether
independent b. Under his prudent admriniftra-
tion, Cuba became one of the most flourishing
of the Spanish settlements, The fame of'this
allured many persons from the other colonies
thither, in hopes of finding either some perma-
nent establishment, or some employment for
their activity. As Cuba lay to the weft of all
the illands occupied by the Spaniards3 and as
the ocean, which stretches beyond it towards
that quarter, had not hitherto been explored,
thefl circumstances naturally invited the inha-
bitants to attempt new discoveries. An expe-
dition for this purpose, in which activity and
relblution might conduct to sudden wealth, was
more suited to the genius of the age, than the

'117- and manufa&uring sugar. Instigated by this

spirit, several officers, who had served under
Pedrarias in Darien, entered into an association
to undertake a voyage of discovery. They per-
fuaded Francisco Hernandez Cordova, an opu-
lent planter in Cuba, and a man of distinguished
courage, to join with them in the adventure,
and chore him to be their commander. Velaf-
quez not only approved of the design, but as-
sifted in carrying it on. As the veterans from
Darien were extremely indigent, he and Cor-
dova advanced money for purchasing three small
vessels, and furnishing them with every thing
requisite either for traffic or for war. A hundred
and ten men embarked on board of them, and
failed from St. Jago de Cuba on the eighth of
February one thousand five hundred and seven-
teen. By the advice of their chief pilot, An-
tonio Alaminos, who had served under the first
admiral Columbus, they stood directly weft,
relying on the opinion of that great navigator,
who uniformly maintained that a westerly course
would lead to the most important discoveries.

Ot the twenty-firft day after their departure

from St. Jago, they saw land, which proved
to be Cape Caioche, the eastern point of that
large peninsula projecting from the continent

of

of America, which still retains its original BooK Il..
name of Tucatan. As they approached the 1517.
shore, five canoes came off full of people de- Yucatla.
cently clad in cotton garments; an astonishing
fpe&acle to the Spaniards, who had- found
every other part of America possessed by naked
savages. Cordova endeavoured by finall pre-
sents to gain the good-will of these people.
They, though amazed at the ifrange objects
now presented for the first time to their views
invited the Spaniards to visit their habitations,
with an appearance of cordiality. The landed
accordingly, and as they advanced into the
country, they observed with new wonder tome
large houses built with stone. But they soon
found that, if the people of Yucatan had made
progress in improvement beyond their country-
men, they were likewise more artful and war-
like. For though the Cazique received Cor-
dova with many tokens of friendship, he had
polred a considerable body of his fubje&cs in
aimbutlh behind a thicket, who, upon a signal
given by him, rushed out and attacked the
Spaniards with great boldness, and some degree
ot martial order. At the firif flight of their
arrois, fifteen of the Spaniards were wounded;
but the Indians were struck with such terror
by the tudden explosion of the fire-arms, and
IL lfurpriid at the execution done by them, by

Z a the

Boor nI. the cross-bows, and by the other weapons of

their new enemies, that they fled precipitately.
X -o Cordova quitted a country where he had met

with such a fierce reception, carrying off two
prisoners, together with the ornaments of a
finall temple, which he plundered in his re-
trear.

HE continued his course towards the weft

without losing fight of the coast, and on the
c==,ety. sixteenth day arrived at Campeachy. There

the natives received them more hospitably;
but the Spaniards were much surprised, that on
all the extensive coast along which they had
failed, and which they imagined to be a large
ifiand, they had not observed any river'. As
their water began to fail, they advanced, in
hopes of finding a supply; and at length they
discovered the mouth of a river at Poronchan,
tome leagues beyond Campeachy.

cAi-ks; but notwirhltanding this precaution, the

Their commander, though wounded in twelve 10,
different places, directed the retreat with pre-
Jence of mind equal to the courage with which
he had led them on in the engagement, and
with much difficulty they regained their ships.
After this fatal repulse, nothing remained but
to haften back to Cuba with their shattered
forces. In their passage thither they suffered
the most exquisite distress for want of water,
that men wounded and sickly, ihut up in small
vessels, and exposed to the heat of the torrid
zone, can be supposed to endure. Some of
them, finking under thelf calamities, died by
the way; Cordova, their commander, expired
soon after they landed in Cuba'.

sion of this expedition, it contributed rather to
animate than to damp a spirit of enterprize
among the Spaniards. They had discovered
an extensive country, situated at no great
distance from Cuba, fertile in appearance, and
possessed by a people far superior in improve-
ment to any hitherto known in America.

'' '. intercourse with the natives, they had brought

off some ornaments of gold, not considerable
in value, but of singular fabric. These cir-
cumftances, related with the exaggeration na-
tural to men desirous of heightening the merit
of their own exploits, were more than sufficient
to excite romantic hopes and expectations.
Great numbers offered to engage in a new
expedition. Velasquez, solicitous to diflin-
guifh himself by some service so meritorious,
as might entitle him to claim the government
of Cuba independent of the admiral, not only
encouraged their ardour, but at his own ex-
pence fitted out four ships for the voyage.
Two hundred and forty volunteers, among
whom were several persons of rank and fortune,
embarked in this enterprise. The command
of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a young
man of known merit and courage, with in-
ftructions to observe with attention the nature
of the countries which he should discover, to
barter for gold, and if circumrnfances were in-
viting, to fettle a colony in bome proper station.

first land which they made was the island of BoosII$.
Cozumel, to the east of Yucatan. As all the ' i~.
inhabitants fled to the woods and mountains at May 3-
the approach of the Spaniards, they made no
long stay there, and without any remarkable
occurrence they reached Potonchan on the
opposite fide of the peninsula. The desire of
avenging their countrymen who had been slain
there, concurred with their ideas of good po-
licy, in prompting them to land, that they
might chastise the Indians of that district with
such exemplary rigour, as would strike terror
into all the people around them. But though
they disembarked all their troops, and carried
ashore some field-pieces, the Indians fought
with such courage, that the Spaniards gained
the viEtory with difficulty, and were confirmed
in their opinion that the inhabitants of this
country would prove more formidable enemies
than any they had met with in other parts of
America. From Potonchan, they continued
their voyage towards the weft, keeping as near
as poflible to the shore, and casting anchor
every evening, from dread of the dangerous
accidents to which they mnight be exposed in
an unknown sea. During the day, their eyes
were turned continually towards land, with a
mixture of surprise and wonder at the beauty
of the country, as well as the novelty of the

Z 4 objects

BooK mi. obje&s which they beheld. Many villages

1s51. were scattered along the coast, in which they

could diltinguifh houses of stone that appeared
white and lofty at a distance. In the warmth
of their admiration, they fancied these to be
cities adorned with towers and pinacles; and
one of the soldiers happening to remark that
this country resembled Spain in its appearance,
Grijalva, with universal applaule, called it New
SpJa;;, the name which itill distinguishes this
extcnfive and opulent province of the Spanish
:' epire in America. They landed in a river
vwhich the natives called Tabasco, and the fame
of their vitorv at Potonchan having reached
this place, the cazique not only received them
a nicabtl, but beltowed presents upon them
of Iuch value, as confirmed the high ideas
which the Staniards had formed with refpecL
to the wealth and fertiiitv of the country. These
ideas were railsed frill higher by what occurred
ar the place where they next touched. This
was cor.:.3erably t the v-est of Tabalco, in the
c .s.... province lince known by the name of Guaxaca.

There they were received with relepect paid to
superior beings. The people perfumed them
as they landed with incenle. of gum copal, and
preiocnted to them as ol-erings tihe choicest deli-
c.cies of their countr-. Thie were extremely
fnj js tradi;g with t:her new visitants, and in

fix

fix days the Spaniards obtained ornaments of BooKin.
gold, of curious workmanship, to the-value of ,
fifteen thousand pesos, in exchange for Euro-
pean toys of small price.. - The two prisoners
whom Cordova had brought from Yucatan,
had hizherto served as interpreters; but as they
did nor understand the language of this country,
the Spaniards learned from the 'natives by
signs, that they were subjects of a. great. mo-
narch called Montezuma, whose dominion ex-
tended over that and many other provinces.
Leaving this place, with which he had so much
reason to be pleased, Grijalva continued his
course towards the weft. He landed on a finall June 1..
island, which he named the fie of Sacrifices,
becaute there the Spaniards beheld, for the firftl
time, the horrid fpeftacle of human victims,
which the barbarous superstition of the natives
efrered to their gods. He touched at another Sr. Juande
finall island, which he called St. Juan de Ulua. u",,-
l-rom this place he dispatched Pedro de Alva-
rado, one of his officers, to Velasquez, with a
foill account of the important discoveries which
he had made, and with all the treasure that he
;iad acquired by trafficking with the natives.
After the departure of Alvarado, he himself,
Wvith the remaining vessels, proceeded along
:!.- coalb-as far as the river Panuco, the country

ltill

Boor HI. fiLil appearing to be well peopled, fertile, and

JA~$S. opulent.

m fr SEVERAL of Grijalva's officers contended,
. 4cyig that it was not enough to have discovered those
t'ó= delightful regions, or to have performed, at

their different landing-places, the empty cere-
mony of taking poffefflon of them for the
crown of Castile, and that their glory was in-
complete, unless they planted a colony in some
proper fation, which might not only secure
the Spaniffi nation a footing in the country,
but, with the reinforcements which they were
certain of receiving, might gradually subject
the whole to the dominion of their sovereign.
But the squadron had now been above five
months at sea; the greatest part of their pro-
visions was exhausted, and what remained of
their stores so much corrupted by the heat of
the climate, as to be almost unfit for use; they
had loft tome men by death; others were
ficklv; the country was crowded with people
v.-ho leemed to be intelligent as well as brave;
an.d tlev were under the government of one
powerful monarch, who could bring them to
act a'g.nft their invaders with united force.
To plant a colony under so many circumstances
of diiadvantage, appeared a scheme too peril-

outs

ous to be attempted. Grijalva, though pof- BooKIir.
sessed both of ambition and courage, was defti- ,5s,
tute of the superior talents capable of forming
or executing such a great plan. He judged
it more prudent to return to Cuba, having ful-
filled the purpose of his voyage, and aocom-
plifhed all that the armament which he com-
manded enabled him to perform. He returned
to St. Jago de Cuba, on the twenty-fixth of
October, from which he had taken his depar-
ture about fix months before-.

THIS was the longest as well as the most Prepara-

successful voyage which the Spaniards had another er-
hitherto made in the New World. They had pedition.
discovered that Yucatan was not an island as
they had supposed, but part of the great con-
tinent of America. From Potonchan they had
pursued their course for many hundred miles
along a coast formerly unexplored, stretching
at first towards the weft, and then turning to
the north; all the country which they had dif-
covered appeared to be no less valuable than
extensive. As soon as Alvarado reached Cuba,
Velasquez, transported with success so far be-
yond his most sanguine expectations, immedi-
ately dispatched a person of confidence to carry

ps;. -the rich productions of the countries which had

been discovered by his means, and to solicit
such an increase of authority as might enable
and encourage him to attempt the conquest of
them. Without waiting for the return of his
messenger, or for the arrival of Grijalva, of
whom he was become so jealous or distrustful,
that he resolved no longer to employ him, he
began to prepare such a powerful armament,
as might prove equal to an enterprise of fqt
much danger and importance.

was now intent, terminated in conquests of
greater moment than what the Spaniards had
hitherto achieved, and led them to the know-
ledge of a people, who, if compared with such
of the Americans as were then known, may be
confidered as highly civilised; it is proper to
p.ufc bcfore we proceed to the history of events
ex:remelv different from those which we have
already related, in order to take a view of the
ieate of the New World when first discovered,
and to contemplate the policy and manners of
the rude uncultivated tribes, that occupied all
the parts of it, with which the Spaniards werQ
at this time acquainted.

T H E Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic mo-

nument of the Carthaginian skill in naval affairs,
and one of the most curious fragments transmitted to

us

us by antiquity.. The learned and industrious Mr;
Doedwell, in a dissertation prefixed to the Periplus of
Hanno, in the edition of the Minor Geographers pub-
lifhed at Oxford, endeavours to prove that this is a
spurious work, the composition of fomrne Greek, who
assumed Hanno:s nawe.. But M. deMontefquieu, in
his l'Efprit des Loix, liv. xxi. c. 8. and M. de Boigain-
'iile, in a dissertation publifled tom. xxvi. of the Me-
moires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, &c. have efta-
blifhed its authenticity by arguments which to me
appear unanswerable. Ramufio has accompanied his
translation of this carious voyage with a differratiort
tending to illustrate it. Racolte de Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 112. M. de Bougainville has, with great learning
and ability, treated the fame fubjeas. It appears that
Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation,
undertook this voyage in small vessels, so conffructed
that he could keep close in with the coast. He failed
from Gades to the island of Cerne in twelve days.
This is probably what is known to the moderns
by the name of the Isle of Arguim. It became the
chief fiation of the Carthaginians on that coast ; and
M. de Bougainville contends, that the cifrerns found
there are monuments of the Carthaginian power and
ingenuity. Proceeding from Ccrne, and flill follow-
ing the winding of the coast, he arrived, in feventern
days, at a prom:ontory which he called V77e 7f7jf Horn,
probably Cape Palmas. From this he advanced to
ano:her promontorv, which he named T7.- Ssutlh Iori:,
and which is manifeffly Cape de Tres Puntas, about
five degrees north of the line. A!i the c;rcumftances
cor:tained in th, fShort abfrat ot h.s io0.nal, which

is

L banded down to us, concerning the appearance and

slate of the countries on the coalt of Africa, are con-
firmed and illustrated by a comparison with the ac-
counts of modern navigators. Even those circum-
fltances, which, from their teeming improbability, have
been produced to invalidate the credibility of his rela-
tion, tend to confirm it. He observes, that in the
country to the south of Cerne, a profound silence
reigned through the day; but during the night, innume-
rable fires were kindled along the banks of the rivers,
and the air resounded with the noise of pipes and
drums, and cries of joy. The fame thing, as Ramufio
observes, still takes place. The excefflive heat obliges
the negroes to take shelter in the woods, or in their
houses, during the day. As soon as the fun sets, they
sally out, and by torch-light enjoy the pleafire of
music and dancing, in which they spend the night.
Ramus. i. 113, F. In another place, he mentions the
sea as burning with torrents of fire. What occurred
to AM. Adanfon, on the fame coast, may explain this.
i' As soon," fays he, " as the fun dipped beneath the
horizon, and night overspread the earth with darkness,
the sea lent us its friendly light. While the prow of
our veflel ploughed the foaming surges, it seemed to set
them all on fire. Thus we failed in a luminous inclofure,
which surrounded us like a large circle of rays, from

L ONG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of

Eudoxus round Africa, Polybius, the most intel-

ligent and best informed historian of antiquity, affirms,
that it was not known, in his time, whether Africa
was a continued continent, firetching to the south,
or whether it was encompaftd by the sea. Polybii

fiuj credit to the accounts of those voyages, the former
could not have entertained such a doubt, the latter
could not have delivered such an opinion. Strabo
mentions the voyage of Eudoxus, but treats it as a
fabulous tale, lib. ii. p. 155. ; and, according to his
account of it, no other judgment can be formed with
refped to it. Strabo seems not to have known any
thing with certainty concerning the form and slate of
the foutbern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1180.
Ptolemy, the most inquisitive and learned of all the
ancient geographers, was equally unacquainted with
any part of Africa situated a few degrees beyond the
equinoctial 1'ne; for he supposes that this great con-
tinent was not surrounded by the sea, but that it
flre:ched, without interruption, towards the south
pole: and be so far mistakes its true figure, that he
describes the continent as becoming broader and
broader at it advanced towards the south. Ptolemai

A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very firong

and singular proof of the ignorance of the ancients

with refpecf to the situation of the various parts of the
earth. When Alexander marched along the banks of
the Hydafpes and Acefine, two of the rivers which fall
into the Indus, he observed that there were many cro-
codiles in those rivers, and that the country produced
beans of the fame species with those which were com-
mon in Egypt. From these circumftanccs, he con-
cluded that he had discovered the source of the Nile,
and prepared a fleet to fail down the Hydafpes to
Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1020. This amaz-
ing error did not arise from any ignorance of geogra-
phy peculiar to that monarch ; for we are informed by
Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular atten-
tion in order to acquire the knowledge of this science,
and had accurate maps or descriptions of the countries
through which he marched. Lib. ii. p. 120. But,
in his age, the knowledge of the Greeks did not ex.
tend beyond the limits of the Mediterranean.

I T is probable that the ancients were seldom induced

to advance so far, either by motives of curiosity, or

views of commercial advantage. In consequence of
this, their idea concerning the position of that great
river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch
of the Ganges which he diftinguiflies by the name of
the Great Mouth, in the hundred and forty-fixth de-
gree of longitude from his first meridian in the For-
tuna:e Ilands. But i:s true longitude, computed
from that meridian, is now determined by aitronomical
observations to be only a hund red and five degrees. A
geograpi:er so eminent must have been betrayed into an
error cf this magnitude by the imperfection of the in-
formation v'ich he had received concerning those
dcffart regions; and this affords a striking proof of the
intercourse ; hli the-n being extremely rare. With
refFedp to th- countries of India beyond the Ganges,
his intellig:nce was ffill more defective, and his errors
more ce-.or ous. I sPall have eccafion to observe in

IT is remarkable, that the difcovcries of the ancients

were made chiefly by land ; those of the moderns

zre carried on chiefly by sea. The progress of con-
quefi led to the former, that of commerce to the lat-
ter. It is a judicious observation of Strabo, that the
conquerss of Alexander the Great made known the
East, those of the Romans opened the %Wefl, and those
of Mithridates king of Pontus the North. Lib. i.
p. 26. When discovery is carried on by land alone,
its progress must be flow, and its operations confined.
xVhen it is carried on only by sea, its sphere may be
more extensive, and its advances more rapid ; but it
labours under peculiar defects. Though it may make
known the position of different countries, and afccr-
tain their boundaries as far as thefre are determined by
the ocean, it leaves us in ignorance with refpe& to
their interior frate. Above two centuries and a half
have clapsed since the Europeans failed round the
fouthcrn promontory of Africa, and have traded in
most of its ports; but, in a considerable part of that
gCrcat continent, they have done little more than survey
its coafis, and mark its capes and harbours. Its in-
terior regions are in a great nmeafurc unknown. The
ancients, who had a very imperfecI knowledge of its
coasts, except where they are waflied by the Mediter-
rancan or Red Sea, were accustomed to penetrate into'
its inland provinces, and, if we may rely on the tefti-
iron), of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, had ex-
ipurcd many parts of it now altogether unknowns

T HE notion of the ancients concerning such an ex-

ceffive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as ren-

dered it uninhabitable, and their persisting in this error
long after they began to have some commercial inter-
course with feve-al parts of India lying within the
tropics, must appear so singular and absurd, that it
may not be unacceptable to Come of my readers to pro-
duce evidence of their holding this opinion, and to
account for the apparent inconfiflence of their theory
with their experience. Cicero, who had beltowed at-
ten:ion upon every part of philosophy known to the
ancients, seems to have believed that the toirid zone
was uninaabita'.e, and, o: conlcquence, that there

speak," fays he, " of the southern temperate zone,
and its inhabitants, and concerning those who are
called antipodes, it mufi be always underflood, that
we have no certain knowledge or information concern-
ing the southern temperate zone, whether it be inha-
bited or not. But from the spherical figure of the
earth, and the course which the fun holds between the
tropics, we conclude that there is another zone,
situated to the south, which enjoys the fame degree of
temperature with the northern one which we inhabit."

and eternal frost. There, unbleif with the aspect of
milder flars, perpetual darknels reigns, or at the ut-
most a ferble light reflelted from surrounding snows.
Thie middle of the earth, in which is the orbit of the
fun, is scorched and burnt up with flames and fiery
vapour. Between there torrid and frozen difirias lie
two other portions of the earth, which are temperate;
but, on account of the burning region interposed,
there can be no communication between them. Thus
Heaven has deprived us of three parts of the earth."

p. 154. To there I might add the authority of many
other respectable philosophers and hiflorians of an-
tiquity.

IN order to explain the sense in which this doctrine

was generally received, we may observe, that Parmeni-
des, as we are informed by Strabo, was the first who
divided the earth into five zones, and he extended the
limits of the zone which Le supposed to be uninha-
bitable on account of heat, beyond the tropics. Ari-
ftotle, ais we learn likewise from Strabo, fixed the
bourdaries of the different zones in the fame manner
as ;h-y are defi;ed by modern geographers. But the
progress of cifcovery having gradually demonstrated
th:: evc-ral regions of the earth which lay within the
tropics were not only l,abitable, but populous and
fertile, this induced later geographers to circumscribe
the limits of th: torrid zone. It is not easy to afcer-
lain with precision the boundaries which they allotted
to it. Fronm a paflh.ge in Strabo, who, as far as I
know, is the onl. author of antiquity from whom we
recei: a:vy ;,'n: corcernino this fubjecl, I should con-

\Vith this refrri'ion, the, doarine of the. ancients
concerning the torrid zone appears less absurd ; and we
can conceive the reason of their asserting this zone to be
uninhabitable, even after they had opefed'a Ebmmuni-
cation with several places' Within the tropics.' When
men of fcicnce spoke of the torrid zone, they confider-
ed it as it was limited by the definition'of geographers
to sixteen, or at the utmost to twenty-four' degrees;
and as they knew alhnoft nothing of the countries
nearer to the equator, they might still suppose them to
be uninhabitable. In loose and popular discourse, the
i:ame of the torrid zone continued to be given to all
that portion of the earth which lies within the tropics.
Cicero seems to have been unacquainted with those
ideas of the later geographers, and adhering to the
division of Parmenides, describes the torrid zone as
the largest of the five. Some or the ancients rejected
the notion concerning the intolerable heat of the torrid

zone as a popular error. This, we are told by
Plutarch, was the sentiment of Pythagoras, and we
learn from Strabo, that Eratoflhenes and Polybius had
aJdptcd the fame opinion, lib. ii. 154. Ptolemy seems
to hive paid no regard to the ancient doctrine and
opinions concerning the torrid zone.

HlIE spherical figure of the earth was kdown to the
ancient geographers. They invented the method,

Rill in use, of computing the longitude and latitude
of different places. According to their doctrine, the
equator, or'irriaginary line which encompasses the earth,
contained- three hundred and sixty degrees; there they
divided into twenty-four parts, or hours, each equal
to fifteen degrees. The country of the Seres or Sins,
being the farthest part of India known to the ancients,
was supposed, by Marinus Tyrius, the most eminent
of the ancient geographers before Ptolemy, to be sis-
teen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees to
the east of the first meridian, pafling through the For-
tunate fllands. Ptolemaei Geogr. lib. i. c. it. If
this supposition was well-founded, the country of the
Scires, or China, was only nine hours, or one hundred
and thirty-five degrees weft from the Fortunate or
Canary nflands; and the navigation, in that direction,
was much shorter than by the course which the Portu-
g:cfc wc ;e pursuing. Marco Polo, in his travels, had

fron:ier of that va'.s crpmire is seven hours, or one

E VERY monument of such a man as Columbus

is valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdi-

pidity, his humanity, his prudence, his public spirit,
and courtly address. " I would have been lets con-
cerned for this misfortune, had I alone been in dan-
ger, both because my life is a debt that I owe to the
Supreme Creator, and because I have at other times
been exposed to the most imminent hazard. But what
gave me infinite grief and vexation was, that after it
had pleased our Lord to give me faith to undertake
this enterprise, in which I had now been so successful,
that my opponents would have been convinced, and
the glory of your highnesses, and the extent of your
territory increased by me, it flould please the Divine

Majesty

Majesty to flop all by my death. All this would
have been more tolerable, had it not been attended
with the loss of those men whom 1 had carried with
me, upon promise of the greaterf prosperity, who
feeing themselves in such difirefs, cursed not only
their coming along with me, but that fear and awe
of me, which prevented them from returning as
they often had resolved to have done. But besides
all this, my sorrow was greatly increased, by recol-
lesing that I had left my two sons at school at Cor-
dova, deflitute of friends, in a foreign country, when
it could not in all probability be known that I had
done such services as might induce your highnesses
to remember them. And though I comforted myself
with the faith that our Lord would not permit that,
which tended so much to the glory of his church, and
which I had brought about with so much trouble, to
remain imperfect, yet I confidered that, on account of
my fins, it was his will to deprive me of that glory,
which I might have attained in this world. While in
th;s confused Prate, I thought on the good fortune
which accompanies your highnesses, and imagined,
that although I should perish, and the vessel be loft, it
was possible that you might somehow come to the
knowledge of my voyage, and the success with which
it was attended. For that reason I wrote upon parch-
ment with the brevity which the situation required,
that I had discovered the lands which 1 promised, in
how many days I had done it, and what course I had
followed. I mentioned the goodness of the country,
the character of the inhabitants, and that your high-
neffes fubjcas were left in poffemion of all that I had

discovered.

dif covered. Having fealed this writing, I addreffled it
to your highnesses, and promised a thousand ducats to
any person who ihould deliver it fealed, so that if any
foreigners found it, the promised reward might prevail
on them not to give the information to another. I
then caused a great cask to be brought to me, and
wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and as-
terwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the cask, and
having flopt it well, I call it into the sea. All the
men believed that it was some aft of devotion. Ima-
gining that this might never chance to be taken up, as
the (hips approached nearer to Spain, I made another
packet like the first, and placed it at the top of the
poop, so that if the ship funk, the calk remaining
above water might be committed to the guidance of
fortune."

led to the discovery of the New World, not by his
own inventive or enterprising genius, but by infor-
mation which he had received. According to their
account, a vessel having been driven from its courle
by cafterly winds, was carried before them far to the
wcft, and landed on the coast of an unknown country,
from which it returned with difficulty ; the pilot, and

after their arriva', all the four died; but the pilot
havin~ been received into the house of Columbus, his
intimate friend, disclosed to him, before his death,
the secret of the difcovcrv which he had accidentally
made, and left him his papers containing a journal of
the voyage, which served as a guide to Columbus in
his undertaking. Gomara, as far as I know, is the
firfi author who published this story, Hist. c. 13.
Every circuriflance is deflitute of evidence to support
it. N'either the name of the vessel nor its destination
is known. Some pretend that it belonged to one of
the fea-po;t towns in Andalusia, and was failing either
to the Canaries, or to Madeira; others, that it was a
Bifcavner in i-t way to England; others, a Portuguese
ship trading on the coast of Guinea. The name of
the pilo: iz alike unknown, as well as that of the port
in which he landed on his return. According to some,
it was in Portugal ; according to others, in \Iadeira,

THE Spaniards are not the only people who have

called in question Columbus's claim to the honour of
having discovered America. Some German authors
aleribe this honour to Martin Behaim, their country-
man. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of
Schwar:zbachi, citizens of the first rank in the Im-
perial town of Nuremberg. Having fludied under the
celebrated John Muller, better known by the name of
Rc iomlontanus, he acquired such knowledge of cos-
mozr.iphy, as prompted him to explore those regions,
the situation and qualities of which he had been ac-
cutloimcd to invefiigate and describe. Under the pa-
trona4e of the Duchess of Burgundy he repaired to
Lifbji, whither the fame of the Portuguese discoveries
invited all the adventurous spirits of the age. There,
as we learn from Herman Schedel, of whose Chronicon
Alundli a German translation was printed at Nurem-
berg A.. D. 149., his merit as a cosmographer raised
him, in conjunction with Diego Cano, to the com-
mand of a squadron fitted out for discovery in the year
jA48A. In that voyage, he is said to have discovered
the kingdom of Congo. He fettled in the island of
Fayal, one of the Azores, and was a particular friend
of Columbus. Herrera, dec. I. lib. i.c. 2. Magel-

hvpothefis of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New
World." Philof. Transact. vol. Iviii. p. 91, &c.
Beside this, if the Welfhi, towards the close of the
twelfth century, had fettled in any part of America,
some remains of the Christian doicrine and rites must
have been found among their descendants, when they
were discovered about three hundred years posterior to
their migration ; a period so flhort, that, in the courie
of it, we cannot well suppose that all European ideas
and arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttelton,
in his notes to the fifth book of his Hiftorv of Henry II.
p. 37 I. has examined what Powell relates concerning
the discoveries made by Madoc, and invalidates the
truth of his flory by other argumen:s of great weight.

THE pretensions of the Norwegians to the dif-

covery of America, seem to be' better founded than
those of the Germans or Velfli. The inhabitants of
Scandinavia were remarkable in the middle ages for
the boldness and extent of their maritime cexcuifions.
In 874, the Norwegians difcavered, and plai:ed a
colony in Iceland. In 982, they discovered Giceni
land, and eftablifised settlements there. From that,
fcme of their navigators proceeded towards the weft,
and discovered a country more inviting than those
horrid regions with which they were acuaiinrcd. Ac-
cording to their representation, this cou:try was sandy
on the coasts, but in the interior parts level and
covered with wood, on which account they gave it

B b 4 thz

the name of Hell,--land, and Mark-laed, and having
afterwards found some plants of the vine which bore
grape., they called it I1.n-land. The credit of this
fto.y reas, as far as I know, on the authority of the
saga, or chronicle of king Olaus, cornpofed by Snorro
Sturionides, or Sturiujnss, published by Perinfkiold at
Stockholm A. D. 1697. As Snorro was born in the
ye:r i l 7, his chronicle might be compiled about two
centuries after the event which he relates. Hlts ac-
c5u:.: of the navigation and discoveries of Biern, and
his c-mpanion Lihf, is a very rude confused tale,
p. C104. 110. 326. It is impolfible to discover from
him, what part of America it was in which the Nor-
vwegians landed. According to his account of the
length of the days and nights, it muff have been as
far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, on
oIbme part of the ccaft of Labradore, approaching near
to the entry of Hudson's Straits. Grapes, celtainly,
are not the production of that country. Torfeus
supposes that there is an error in the text, by refify-
ing of which, the place where the Norwegians landed
may bc- fJpofed to be situated in latitude 49°. But
r.either 1i that the region of the vine in America.
From rcruling Snorro's tale, I fhouid think that the
fir:la.i'n or Newfoundlanrd corref.,onds befi v.ith that
o :he country diScovered by the Norwegians. Grapes,
however, are not the production of that barren iuland.
Other c.,rjc.urcs are mentioned bv .AM. Ma!let, In-
ro . i 'H ft. de Dannem. 175, &c. I am not fuffi-
ci;ntiv acquainted with the literature of the north, to
examine them. It f[ems maniftcl, that if the Nor-
we;iar.s did dlfcover any part of America at that

COLUMBUS seems to have formed some very

singular opinions concerning the countries which

he had now discovered. The violent swell and agita-
tion of the waters on the coast of Trinidad led him to
conclude this to be the highest part of the terraqueous
globe, and he imagined that various circumstances
concurred in proving that the sea was here visibly
elevated. Having adopted this erroneous principle,
the apparent beauty of the country induced him to fall
in with a notion of Sir John Mandeville, c. 102. that
the terrefirial paradise was the highest land in the earth ;
and he believed that he had been so fortunate as to
discover this happy abode. Nor ought we to think it
firange that a person of so much sagacity should be in-
fluenced by the opinion or reports of such a fabulous
author as Mandeville. Columbus and the other dif-
coverers were obliged to follow such guides as they
could find ; and it appears from several passages in the
manuscript of Andr. Bernaldes, the friend of Colum-
bus, that no inconsiderable degree of credit was given
to the testimony of Mandeville in that age. Bernaldes
frequently quotes him, and always with respect.

IT is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo,

the mlft ancient Spanish hirtorians of America, nor

Herrera, confider Ojeda, or hIs companion Vespucci,

They uniformly ascribe this honour to Columbus.

werers to conceal the actijns which he performed.
Bt-: Martyr and Benzon!, both Italians, could not be
warped bv the fame prejudice. Martyr was a contem-

had the best opportunity to be exacaly informed with
respect to all public tranactaions; and yet, neither in
his Dccads, the firIt general hiltory published of the
New WVorld, nor in his Epistles, which contain an
account of ail the remarkable events of his time, does
he a-cribe to Vespucci the honour of having firfll dif-
covered the continent. Benzoni went as an adven-
turer to America in the year 15 ti, and resided there
a considerable time. He appears tJ have been animated
with a warm zeal for the honour of Italy, his native
country, and yet does not mention the exploits and
discoverics of Vespucci. Herrera, who compiled his
general hifiorv of America from the most authentic re-

Verfpucci of fallififing the dates of both the voyages

that in a judicial inquiry into this matter by the royal

that he touched at Hispaniola when returning to Spain
from his firt voyage; whereas Vespucci gave out that
they returned dire&ly to Cadiz from the coast of Paria,
and touched at Hispaniola only in their second voyage ;
and that he had finished the voyage in five months;
whereas, according to Vespucci's account, he had
employed seventeen months in performing it. Viag-

time come to an agreement with Roldan, who opposed
OeJcda's attempt to excite a new infurreaion, and, of
consequence, his voyage must have been posterior to
that of the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 84. Ac-

f;l'rahle degree of favour. The affairs of the New

Antonio 'Fortes, a friend of Columbus. It is not

It is a work of no merit, written with little judgment,
and less candour. He contends for his countryman's
title to the discovery of the continent with all the blind
zeal of national partiality, but produces no new evi-

H E form employed on this occasion served as a
mrodel to the Spaniards in all their subsequent

conquerss in America. It is so extraordinary in its
nature, and gives us such an idea of the proceedings
of the Spaniards, and the principles upon which they
founded their ri-ht to the extensive dominions which
they acquired in the New World, that it well merits
the attention of the reader. " I Alonfo de Ojeda,
servant of the moif high and powerful kings of Cafiile
and Leon, the conquerors of barbarous nations, their
mcfienzer and captain, notify to you and declare, in
as rnp'e form as I am capable, that God our Lord,
who is one and eternal, created the heaven and the
earth, a:.d one man and one woman, of whom you and

wve,

we, and all the men who have been or ihall be in the
world, are descended. But as it has come to pass,
through the number of generations during more than
five thousand years, that they have been dispersed into
different parts of the world, and are divided into vari-
ous kingdoms and provinces, because one country was
not able to contain them, nor could they have found
in one the means of subsistence and preservation;
therefore God our Lord gave the charge of all those
people to one man, named St. Peter, whom he confli-
tuted the lord and head of all the human race, that
all men, in whatever place they are born, or in what-
ever faith or-place they are educated, might yield obe-
dience unto him. He hath fubjeded the whole world
to his jurifdidtion, and commanded him to cftablifll
his residence in Rome, as the most proper place for
the government of the world. He likewise promised
and gave him power to eflablifh his authority in every
other part of the world, and to judge and govern all
Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and all other
people, of whatever sect or faith they may be. To
him is given the name of Pope, which signifies admir-
able, great father and guardian, because he is the fa-
ther and governor of all men. Those who lived in
the tim2 of this holy father obeyed and acknowledged
him as their lord and king, and the superior of the
universe. The fame has been observed with refpecl to
them who, since his time, have been chosen to the
pontificate. Thus it now continues, and will con-
tinue to the end of the world.

" ONE

" ONE of there pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath

made a grant of these islands, and of the Tierra Firme
of the ocean sea, to the Catholic kings of Castile,
Don Ferdinand and Donna Isabella, of glorious me-
mory, and their successors, our fovereigrns, with all
they contain, as is more fully cxprelled in certain
deeds passed upon that occasion, which you may fee,
if you desire it. Thus his majesty is king and lord of
these islands, and of the continent, in virtue of this
donation ; and, as king and lord aforesaid, most of
the islands to which his title hath been notified, have
recognized his majesty, and now vie!d obedience and
fubjc lion to him as their lord, vo'untarilv and with-
out resistance ; and inflantly, as S£on a; they received

Besides this, his majesty will bestow upon you many
