# THE PREFACE.

lO period in -the hiffoly of one's , ow

gether ~uninteresting. Suchi tranfaaQions as tend
to: illuffrate' t~he progrels of its constitution ,
lavws , osr manners , mlerit: the utm~ost: at~tentiate.~
Evern remnote and. minute events are objeas of
a -curiosity, which , being natural to the hurban

ihid -, the gratifi ca~tion of it is attended. 'ith

Hpleafure.

.ByT., ~with refpe61. to the hifkor~y of foreign
.Sta~tes· , we· mult set ~other bounds to our de-
fire of information. T~he universal progref~is of
Science, during the two last centuries, the arti
of printing , . and other obvious causes , have
f4illed, Europe with such a mulltiplicit~y of hiftlo
·ries ,· and with such. vast colle(5ions of hiiflorical
manaterials,, that .the term. of human life is 'too
tfhort for the Rtudy or even the~perufal of them.
It is- ne~ceff~ar , . then , not onl~y.for those wvho

a e;.c~alled, top .conduct the affairs of nations ,

- but ~for fach as inquire and reas~on concerning
therm, to remain fatisfiedl wvith a general know-
ledge of distant events , and to confine their
study if· hifforiy in detail chiefly to that period,
in which~ the several States of Europe, having
become intimately conneated , the operations of
one power are so felt by atll, as to influence their?
councils, an~dsto regulate their measures.

SOME bou~ndary , then , ough~t ~to be fixed in

order to separate there; periods. .An aera Thnould
be .pointed out, prior to which, each country,
little .conneated with those around it , may
trace its own history~ apart; after whbich, the
tranfiaaions of every considerable nation~ in Eur-
rope become interditing and infirudive to all.
W'Mith~ thiis ideienio' I -un~dertook to write thie
hifforyi of the E~mperor Cau'indtE I. - Tt was
during his admitiiffrationr that the p~owers of Eu-~
rope were for~med into one great· political fyfieur,
in 'which~ each :tbo~irki ' ftati'on: - wherein -it -has
f~irc~e remained with les~s vcariation , than couldl
have been expedted after the shocks~ occafloned
by to many ·internal revolutioris (and to many
foreign wars. -The grea~t events whtich happened
tihen have hobt hit~herto- fpent' their force.- The
.politicail pr~inciples and maxim , ' theh eftabifhid,

ftilli continue to obperate. T~She ideas concerning
th~e balance of power , then introduced or rendered
general , still influence the councils of~ rations.

~H.E age~ of CHARLES V. rnay therefore be

considered -as the p~eriod at which the polit~ical
Rtate of Europe began to afirnme a new form.
I have endeavoured to render my account of it,
an fntroduiain to the hiflory of Europe sub-
sequent to his reign. W~hile his numerous Bio-
graphers deferibe his personal qualities and adlions;
while the hifforianls of different countries relate
occurrences the consequences of - which ,were
local or transient, it hath; been rny purpose to
record only thos~e great tr~anf~adi·ns in his reign,
th~e effeas of which were kiniverfat-, ·or contirnue
t$o be permanent.

As my readers could derive little infkrudtion

from furch a hiffory of the reign ~of CHARLES V.
without some information concerning 'th~e state
of Et ylpe previous to the sixteenth century, my
desire of f~i~plying this hath produced a prelimi-
nary volume , in which I have attempted to
point out and explain the great causes and events
to w~hose operation all the improvements 11n the
politionil state· of Europe, from the f~ub~verfolo of

the ~Roman Empire to the beginning 'of ~ths-
sixteenth century ,musk be as~cribed. - I hbave:
exhibitied 'a view of. the progre~ss of f~ocie~ty'
in Europe , not only, with refped2 to interior
governments, la~s , and manners , but wv~ith re-
fpedt to ·the command of the nationoal force requi-
site in -foreignz ·operations; and I -have deferibed'
the: political conftittition- of the principal Rtates
in Europe at the time wvhen C~harles V. began
his reign.

IN this part of my work^ I have been led

into several critical dif~quifitions , which belong
rnore properly -to the province of the lawyer
or. antiquary , than to that of t~he hifforian.m
TPhefe I ha~ve placed at the end of th~e first vqt·
lume, :under the title of Pro~ofs and· Illuffrationrs.
IB/lany of my readers will, probably , ·give little-
a ttention to su~ch researches. "To fTome they may,
perhaps, appear the moit curious and' intereffing~
pJarqtof the work. I havTe carefully·~~S po tag o
the sources from which I have derived informa.
tion , anld have cited the writersi on v o Matho-
rity .I reily with a minute exadnefs , wh~lich- mightl
appear ato border upon ostent~ation ,; if it were"
possible to be vain of having read books, iany
of ~which nothinrg b~ut' the· duty ofexamittin-g w\ithB

iaccuracy: whatever I laid before the P]Lublick,
would -have induced me to open. As my inquii-,
riies c-ond~u~ed me often into paths whi~ch were
obs~cure or- little frequented , such conflant re-
course to the authors who have been ~my guides
was ~not only necessary for aut~heatiatitng th~e
~fadts which are the foundations of my reasonings,
but may - be useful in pointing out the way to
such as ·shall hereafter hold the fame course ,
·and' iix enaibling them to carry on their researches
wNith greater fac~ility and l'uccef~s.

EvERY intelligent reader will obs~erve one

.amili~on in· my work, the reason of which it is
sreceffary to explain. I have given no account:
of the- conquests of IMexico and Peru , or of
t~he eftabifhment of the Spanish colonies in the
con'tinent and ifiands of America. . The hiffory
of these events I originally intended to have re-
lated at considerable length. ` But upon a nearer
and more attentliver consideration of this part of
:wiy~ plan, I· found that the discovery of the new
world ; the slate of society amoing its ancient
iiihabitants; their charlater ,mannery:, and arts;
the genius of the European settlements in its
Ivarious provinces , together with thq~ influence
of phefe upon the Eyftemas gs policy or Fommerce

in Europe, were ub~jeas so splendid and important,
that a superficial view of them· could afford little
fatisfadtion ; to treat of them as extensively as
.they merited ,muRt produce an episode , difpro-
pgortionate to the principal work. I. have there-
fore reserved ther~e for a separate hillory; which,
if the performance now offered to the Publick.
thall receive its approbation, I propofepto tmn-
dertake.

To ovOUG, by omittinig such ~onfiderable but

detached articles in the reign of Charles V7. IE
have circumscribed my narration w\ithin more
narrow limits , I a~m yet , persuaded , friom - this
vciew of the intention and nature of the work
which i thoug-ht it; necefa~ryy to lay before ,my
readers,~ that the plah rmuft RLill appear to them
t1oo extensive, and the undertaking too arduous.
I have often ,felt them to be so. But my convidion
.of the utility of fach. a ~hiffory prompted me to
persevere.- With what success I have executed
it, the Publick· r nuft /nowi judge. :Iwait, ·in
frolicitud~e, for its .decifionj 4to ·which I Shall
submit; with a refpedeful filenlce.

courage, that the Romans gained any ad~vantage
over them. A single battle did not, as among
the 'effeminate inhabitants of Aia , decide the
fate of a slate. The vanquilhed people resumed
their arms with fresh spirit, and their undisciplined

facceffively laid waste, a great part of their'inha-

of fEurther resistance , s~ubmitted to the .RHoman

nhe im. THKE R~omans having thus des~olated Europe, fetl
yrovements themselves to civilize it. The form of govern-.
trduncest ment which they established in the Conquered pro-

vinces, though severe, was regular, and pres~erved
publick tranquillity. As a consolation for the lot's
of liberty, they communicated their arts, fCciences,
Janguage, and ·manners, to their new fabjeAs.
Europe began to breathe, and to recover strength
after the cala~mities which it .had undergone; agri-
culture was encouragedi; populationl increased; the
ruined cities were rebuilt; new towns were founded;
an lappearance of prosperity succeeded, and repaired,
in som7e degree~, the havock of wyar.

SThe violent irruptjion of the Gogh~si Vandals , Huns,

and other barbarians hastened this eve~nt , and Ipre-
cipitated the downfal of the Empire. New nations
fTeemed to arise, and to rush from unknown regions,
i3n order to take vengeance on the Romans for the
calamities which they had inflidSed on mankind.
T~here~ fierce tribes either inhabited the various pro-

the Swe~des, the ~Poles, the fubjeAs of the RCufiarn
Empire, and the Tartars. T~heir condition, and
trantad~ions, previous to their invasion of the Em-
pire', are but -little known. All our information
wit~l refped to ther~e is derived from the Romans;
and as they did not penetrate~ far into countries
wvhich were at that tsime uncultivated arid unin;
vriting, the accounts of their o~riginlal slate: givert
by them are extremelly imped~ed. The rude inha-
bitants themselves, destitute of science, and of re-
cards, withoult leisure, or curiosity to enmquire into
remote events, retained, perhaps, some indifinta
memory of recent occurrences, but beyond there,

Tlhe motives THrIEP L first inroads into the Emnpire proceeded

some enterprizing or popular leader , they sallied:
out,~ of their fbrefts; broke in upon the frontier:
provinces wiith irresistible violence; put all who
ojppofed them.to· t~he iiword; carried off the mos%
v8luable effets· of the inhabitants; dragged along
multitudes of captives in chains; wasted all. before

ple who had no cities, and feldomn any fixed habi-
tation, were s~o little attached to their native foil,
that they migrated without reludance from one
place ·to another. New adventurers followed
them. The lands which they deserted were oc-
cupied by more remote tribes of barbarians.
Th~ere, in their turn, pushed forward into mTore The extent

military discipline. But, under the Emperors`, the
former were forgotten or despised, and the latter
w~as gradually relaxed. The armies of the Empire
in the fourth and fifth ·centuries bore fearcely any;
resemblance to those invincible legions which had
beeni viAorious wherever they marched. Initead
of freemen, who voluntarily took arms fr-om the

SEG'P?. LI love of glory, or of their country, prov~incials and

barbarians were bribed or forced into service. They
~were too feeble, or too proud to submit to ·the fa-
tigue of military duty. They erven complained of
the weight of their defensive armour, as intole-
r-a~ble, and laid it aside. Infarntry, from~ which the
armies of ancient Rorme derived their vigour and
RQability, fell into "contempt; the effeminate and
ulndifciplined soldiers of later times could hardly
be3 brought to venture into the field but on horse-
Sback. There wretched troops, however, were the
only guardians of the Empire. The jealousy of
des~potism had deprived the people of the are of
arms ; and ~subjeCts oppreffedc and rendered inca-
pable of defending themselv~es, had neither sp~irit,
nor inaclination to resist their inrvaders, fro~m whorm
they had little to fear, because their condition could
Shardly be rendered more unhappy. As the mar-
tial spirit became extinat, the revenues of the Em.-
pire gradually diminished. The taste for the l-uxu-
r~ies of the East increased- to furch a pitch.in the
I[mperial court, that great sums were~carried into
India, from which money never returns. By thet
vast fCubfidies paid to the barbaro~us nations, a
still greater quantity, of species was withdrawn
from circulation. The frontier provinces wasted
by frequent incurflons became unable to pay the
customary tribute; and the wealth of the world,
which had long centered in the capital of the Em-
ptre,· ceased to flowc thither in the fame abundance,
or ~was diverted into other .channels.. The limits
of the Empire contimsed to be as extensive as ever,

wvhile the spirit requisite for its defence declined, SECT. I,
and its refaurces were exhauffed. A vast body,
languid, and almoff unanimated , bec~ame incapa-
'ble of anly effort to save itself ,and was easily over-
poweredl. The Emperors, who had the abs~olute
dire~ion of this disordered sys~tem , funk in the soft-
pefs of eaftern,1uxury , shut up within the .wvalls of
a palace, ignorant of war , unacquainted ~wit~h as-
fairs, and governed entirely by women and eu-
nuchs, or by miniifters equally effeminate, trembled

fierceness, either fled at their approach , or we~re
routed. in the first onse~t.- The feeble expedient:
to which the Emperors had recourse , of taking
large bodies of the barbarians into pay , and of
employing them to repel new invaders, instead of
retarding; hastened the deftruidion of the Empire.

and an incredcible deftru~tion of the human species.
Civilized nations which take arms upon cool re-
fledtion, from motives of policy or prudence, with
a view to guard against some diliant danger , or to
prevent fame remote contingency , carry on their
hostilities with so little rancour , or animosity , tat
war among them is disarmed of half its terrors.
Barbarians are firanger-s to fuedh refinements, THhey

enemies feel the weight of their vengeance , nor
does their rnge fablfide until it be satiated with in-
slid~ing on them every pofirble catamity. It is with
fach a spirit that the fCavage tribes in America carry
on their petty w~ars. ILt was with the fame spirit
tehat the more powerful and no less fierce barbarianrs
in the north of Europe, and of Asia fell upon the
Roman Empir-e.

forded shelter to a few mriferable inhalbitants whom
chance had pres~erved, or the fwvord of the.enemy,
wearied with destroying, had''fpared.~ The cona-
qu~erors who first ~fettled in the countries which they
had wasted, were expelled or exterminratedlby new
invaders , who coming from regions farther re-
moved from the civilized parts ,0f the world, were
[till more fierce and rapacious. This brought
new calamities upon mankind , which did not cease

Son of God had accomplifhled the redemption of

performed without considerable expence, fatigue,

came to be considered as an expiation for almoRt
every crime. ~An ·opinion which spread with ra-

quickly appear to ·judge the world 7. Wihhile Pa-

that wvild enterprize. Peter the hermit, for that

wcherever he came kindled the famne enthusiastic
ardour for ·it with which he hims~elf was animated.
T'he council of Placentia, where upwards of thirty
thousand perfoans were assembled, pronounced the
f~chetme to have been f~uggefied by the immedilate
inspiration of heaven. In the council of Clermont,
still mnore numerous , as soon as the, meas~ure ivas
proposed, all cried out with one voice', " It is the
,, will of God. " P-ersons of all ranks were smit-
ten with the contagionz; not only the gallant nobles-
of that age, with their martial followers, whom
the boldness of a romantic enterprize might have
been apt to allure, but men in the more humble
and· pacific stations of life;. ecclefiaf~tics of every
order, and even women and children, engaged with
emulation in an· undertaking which was deemed
sacred and meritorious. If we may believe the
concurring testimony of contemporary authors , fix
millions of persons affirmed the cross ', which was

ideas crowded into their minds ; and they muft-have
been sensible on many occaflons· of the rufficity of

try flourishing. The German Emperors, esp~ecially
those of the Firanconian and Suabian lines , as the
feat of their governlment wa~s far distant from
Italy , poff~effed a feeble and imperfed jurifdidion
in that country. Their perpetual quarrels either
wiith the Popes or with their own turbulent vali~als,
<diverted their attention from the interior police of
Italy, and gavre con~stant employment to their arms,
'T~hef~ecircumffances encouraged the inhabitants of
some of the Italian cities , towards the beginning
of the eleventh century, to assume new privileges
to unite together more clos~ely, and to form them·
selves into bodies politick under the government of
laws eftabloifhed by common confeat'". The rights,
wP~hich many cities acquired by bold or fortunate
xifurpations, others purchased ffrom the Emperors,
who deemed thems~elves gainers when they received
large sums for immunities which they were no
longer able to; withhold; and some citiet obtained
·them gratuitously from the generosity or facility of
the Princes on whom they depended. The great
Increase of wealth which the Cru~ades brought into
Italy, occasioned a new kind of fermentation an
adtivityr in the minds of the people , and excited
such a general passion for liberty and independence,
that before the conclusion of the last CrofadBe, all
the confider'able cities in that country had e-i~ther
purchased or had exto~rted large immunities from
th7e Emperors (1P).

conferring new privileges on the towns situated A.D:xis,
within his own domain. There privileges were --xin.

bodies politick, to be governed by a council and
mnagilhrates of their own nomrination. T'here ma,~-
giff rates had the right of adminiff ering juffice within
their own- precinAs, of levying taxes, of embody-
ing and training to arms the militia of the town,
wvhich took the field when required by the fove-
reign, under the command of officers appointed by
the community. The great barons imitated the:
example of their monarch , and granted like im-
munities to the towns within their territories. They
had wasted fach great sums in their expeditions to
the Holy Land , that they were eager to lay hold
on this new expedient for raising money, by the
sale of those charters of liberty. Though the in-
ftit~ution of communities was as repugnant to their
maxims of policy , as it was adverse to their power,
they disr-egarded remote cons~equences , in order to·
obtain present relief. In less than twvo centuries,

preservation obliged every rnan to court the pa- SEcT I.
tronage of some powerful baron, and in times of
danger his. castle was the place to which all re-
sorted for safety. B ut towns surrounded with
walls, whose inhnabitants were regularly trained
to arms, and bound by interest, as well as by the
rnof foleniin engagements, reciprocally to defend
each~ other, afforded a more commodious and.
secure retreat. The nobles began to be considered
as of less importance, when they ceased to b~e the
sole guardians to whom the people could lqook up,
for protegtion against violence.

IF the nobility fuff~ered some diminution, of their upon thle

credit and powier by the privileges granted to the th own~6,,;
cities, the ~r own acquired an increas~e of both. A~s
there were no regular troops kept on foot in any
of the feudal kingdoms, the Monarch could bring
no army into the field but what was composed of
s~oldiers· furnished by the crown vass~als, always
jealous of the regal authority; rr had he any
funds -for carrying on the publick service, but
such as ·they: granted him with a very ~sparing·
hand. But: when the members of communities were
permitted to bear arms, and were trained to the
use of these, this in some degree su~pplied the first
defedt, and gave the crown the command6 of a
body of men independent of its great vassals. The
attachment of the cities to their sovereigns, whom
they refpedSed as thle firit authors of their liberties,
and whorn they were obliged to court as the

neering spirit of the nobles, contributed somewhat
towards removing the second evil, as,- on manyr
occallons, it procured the crown su~pplies of
moneys which added new force to government ".

aaon th* . THE acquisition of' liberty made su~ch a happy
in crease of
indunry. ch~ange in the condition of all the members of

communit~ies, as r~ous~ed them from that inadtion
into which they had been funk by the wretched.
niefs of their former Rtate. T~he spirit of induffryl
rPevived. Commerce became an object of attention,
and began to fElourifh. Population increased. Inde.
pendence was eta~blithed; and wealth flowed into
cities which had long been the feat, of ,poverty
and opp7remfon. T5realth was accompanied by its
adPual attenda~nts, ostentation and luxury; and
though the former was inelegant and cumbersome,
and the latter indelic~atee they led gradually to
greater refinement in manners, and in the habits
of life. TTogeth~er with this improvement in man-
rners, a more regular species of government and
police was introduced. As cities grew to be more
populous, and the occasions of intercourse- among
xnen increased, statutes and regulations multiplied
of course, and all became sensible that their com-
paon safety depended on observing them with ex-
aatnefs, and on punifhning such as piolated them,

rife in cities, difffufed themselves insensibly through
the reft of the-fociety.

III. THE inhabitants of cities having obtained Theinna.:~-

personal freedom. and municipal jurifdiaion, soon ciries Ic-
acquired civil liberty and political power. It waS luire poli.
a fundamental principle in the feudal system of ;a11"~Ye,
policy, that no freeman could be governed or of the con-
taxed unlefrs by his own consent. Iln confl~equence sitation.
of this , the vaffazls of every baron were called to
his court, in which they established, by mutual
consent, su~ch regulations as they deemed most be-
neficial to their small society, and granted their
superior such supplies of money, as were propor- *
tional to their abilities, or to his wants. The barons
themselves, conformably to the fame maxim, were
admitted into the s~upreme assembly of the nation,
and concurred with the sovereign in enading
laws, or in impolinmg taxres. As the· superior lord,
according to the original plan of feudal policy,
retained the diredt property of those lands which
he granted; in temporary poffefflon, to his vassals,
the law, even after fiefs became hereditary , still
fulppofed this original pradtice to fubiift, and a.
baron continued to be considered as -the guardian
of all who resided within his territories. The great
council of each nation , whether distinguished by
the name of a parliament, a diet, the Cortes, or
the ftates-general, was composed entirely of s~uch
barons, and dignified ecclefiafficks, as held imme-
diately of the crown. Towns, whether situated

SECT. T. within thne royal domain, or on ·the lands of a

fubjeA , depended fdr proteAion on the lord of
w8homn they held. They had no legal name , no
political exjifence , which could entitle them to
be admitted into the legislative assembly , or
could give them any authority there. But as soon
as they were enfranchised , and formed into Bo-
·dies Corporate, they became legal and indepen-
dent members of the constitution, and acquired
all the rights efrential to freemen. Amnongft these,
'the most valuable, was the privilege of a decisive
voice in enading publick laws, and granting na-
tional funblidies. It was natural for cities, accut.
tomed to a form of municipal government ,
according to which no regulation could be efta-
blifh-ed within the community , anld no money

the sacred ties which united them as Chrillians, and
as members of the fame society. But this junaio~n

'awe the credulous spirit of those ages, produced

WornIT this f~uperfitioius opinion, the martial f~pi-an ra ne

rit of Europe, during the middle ages, concurred 2ei ,-,
.in establishing the mode of trial by judicial com-tial aris,4
bat. To be ready to maintain with his sword
.whatever· his lips had uttered, was the first maxim
.of honour with every gentleman. To~ assert their
own rights by force of arms, ·to in·fliQ vengeance
on those who had injured or affronted them, wvere
tehe diftina~ion and pride of high-fpirited nobles.
The form of trial by combat coinciding with this
maxim, flattered and gratified these pafio[ins. Every
min was the guardian of his own honour, and of
.his own life; the juffice of his cause, as well as his
future reputation, depended On his own courage
and prowvefs. This m~ode of decifien was con-

SECT. I. fidered, accordingly, as one of the happiest effort

of wife policy; and as soon as it was introduced
all the forms of trial by fire or water, and other
fCuperfltitious experiments, fell into dis~use, or -were
employed only in controversies between persons o
inferior rank. The trial by combat was autho.
rized over all Europe, and received in every 'coun·
try with equal fa8tisfadion.· Not only queffions
concerning uncertain or ·coxitefied fads , 'but general
and abit~radt points in law, were determined by the
issue of -a combat; and the latter . ·was deemed a
method of dif'covering truth1 more liberal as well
as more f~atisfadtory, than that by examination and
argum-ent. N~ot only might par ties , whose minds
were exasperated by the: eagernes~s and the hostility
·of opposition, defy their antagonist, and require him
to make good his charge, or to prove his innoce'nce,
with2 his s~word; li~ut witneffSes, who had no interest
in the issue of the -quaefion, though called to declare
the truth by laws which ought to have afforded them
prot~eaion, were equally exp)osed to the danger of
a challenge, and equally bound to assert the vera-
city of their evidence by dint of arms. To com-
p~lete. the absurdities of this military jurisprudence,
even the charadter of a judge was not: sacred from
its violence. Any one of the parties might interrupt
a judge when about to deliver his opinion; mig~ht
accus~e him of iniquity and corruption in the most
reproachful terms, and throwiing down his gauntlet,
might challenge him to defend his integrity hir
the field; nor could he, wvithout infamy , refulfe

to accept the defiance; or decline to enter the SECT. $'
lifts against fa~ch an adversary.

Taus th~e form of trial by combat, like other It becomes

abuses, spread gradually, and extended ~to all per-nvec.
sons, and almost to all cafes. E~cclefialticks, .women,
minors, su~perannuated and infirm peyfons , who
could not with decency or justice be compelled to
take arms, and to rmaintain their own cause, were ob-
liged to produce champions, whom they engaged, by
af~fec~ion or rewards, to fight their battles. The so-
lemnities of a judicial combat were faxch as were
natural in an adion, which was considered both as
a formal appeal to God, and as the final decifron
of questions of the highest moment. Every cir-
cumffance relating to them, was regulated by the
ediias of Princes, and expla~ined in the comments
of lawyers, with a minute and even s~uperstitious
accuracy, Skill in these laws and rites was the
only s~cience of which warlike nobles boasted, or
wahich they were ambitious to attain ".

By this barbarorus cuffom, the natural courfershe verni

was entirely perverted. Force usurped the place of
equity in courts of- judicature, and juffice was ba-
nilhed from her proper mansion. Discernment,
learning, integrity , were qualities less necelfary to
a judge , than bodily strength and dexterity in the

authority , monarchs proceeded with caution, and
their first attempts to reff rain , or to ~set any bgunds

earliest~ reftridions of this pradtice which occurs in
the hifftory of Europe, is thlat of Hernry I. of Eng.

far superior to thos~e of his age, endeavoured to ina
troduce a more per~fed jurisprudence, and to sub4
Tt~itute the trial by evidence, in place of that, by
combat. But his regulations, with refpledP to this,
were c~onfined to his own domains; for the great
vassals of th~e crown poff~effed such independent
authority, and were so fondly attached to the an-
clent pradice, that he durit not venture to extend
it to the whole kingdom. Some barons voluntag
rily adopted his regulations. The spirit of courts
of justice became averse to the mode of decision
byr combat, and dis~couraged it on every occasion.
The nobles ;nevertheless, thought it so honourable
to depend for the security of their lives and for-
tunes on their own courage alone , and contended
with -so much vehemence for the pref~ervatioh of
this favourite privilege of their order, that thne fuc-

of offending such powerful fulbjets , were obliged
not only to tolerate, but to authorize the pradtic
which he had attempted to abolish 4". In othe
countries of Europe, efforts equally zealous· were
employed to maintain the eitablifhed cuffom; and
similar concessions were extorted from their refpec.
tive sovereigns. It continued ,howvever , to be an
objeat of policy with every monarch of abilitie
or vigour, to explode the trial by combat; and va
rious edias were iflled for this purpose. But th
observation which was made concerning the righ
o7f private war , is equally applicable to the mode
of trial undler review. No cuitom, how abfud
gfoever it may be , if it has fubifited long, or de

in Europe, as s~cience gradually ~increas~ed, and so-
ciety advanced towards more perfed order. In
proportion as the prerogative of Princes extended,
and came to acquire new force, a power , interested
in fu~pprefing· every pradlice favour~able to the in-
dependence of the nobles , was introdued. The
firuggle, neverthelets, fubifited for several centu-

administration of juffice was reffored, the proceed-

towards civility, when this great caus~e of the fero-

people who conquered the various provinces of
the Raoman Empire , and eftablifhled new king-
d~oms there, the pafiron of resentment , too impe-
tuous to bear controul, was permitted to remain
almost unrestrained by the authority ,of laws.
TFhe person offended, as has been observed ,re-
tained not only the right of prosecuting 'but of
~punilhing his adv~terfary. T4o him it belonged to
infliat such vengeance as fratiated his rage , or to
accept of fach f~atisfadtion as appeased it. But
w~xhile fierce barbarians continued to be thie fiole
judges in their own caue , their enmities were im-
placable, and immortal; they set no bounds either
to~ the degree of their vengeance , or to the dura·
tion oJf their; refentrment. T~he excess~es which this
.occalloned, proved fe deftrudtive of peace and
order in society; as forced them to think of some
remedy. At first, arbiter~sinterpofedl, and by per-
fo~afon or in treaty prevailed on the' party offended
to accept of a fine or composition from the ag-
grkffor , and to drop all farther prof~ecution.i' Blut
as fabmiirola to pers~ons who had no leg~al or magi·
fterial authority was altogether voluntary , it be·
came necelf~ary to establish judges with power
f~ufficient~ to enforce their owYn dec~ifons, The
leader whl~om they were accuffomed to follow and
to fobey, whole courage ~they refpedted, and in
w~hose integrity they placed confidence , was the
person to whom a ~maitial people naturally com·
ni tted this important prerog~ative. Every ch~ieftain
wVas the commander of his tribe in war , and their

jud~ge in peace. Every baron led his vassals to SEFT. 1,
the field, and adminifferedl, juffice to them in his
hall. Their high spirited dependents would not
have recognized any other authority , or have fuab-
mitted to any other jurif~diAion. But in times of
turbulence and violence, the ex~ercise of this new
1fundtion was attended not only with trouble, but
with danger. No person could ass~ume the chai
radter; of a judge, if he did not; poffers power sus-
fLicient to proted2 the one party from the violence
of private revenge , and to compel the other to
.accept of such reparation as he enjoined. In con-
fideration of the extraordinary· efforts which· this
office required, judges , befdes~ the fine which they
appointed to be paid as a compensat~ion to the
person or family who had been injnured, levied an
additional fum as a recompence for their own
Ilabouir ; and in all the feudal kingdoms the latter
was not only as precisely ascertained, but as regu-
larly exadted , as the former.

TUs , by the natural operation ofcircumftances The cxtent:

peculiar to the manners or political itate of the an boad es.~
feudal nations , separate and territorial jurifdiatosns privilege.
came not only to· be established, in every kingdom,
but were established in such a way, that: the in-
terest: of the barons concurred with their ambition
iin maintaining and extending them. It was not
merely a point of honour with the feudal nobles
to dis~pense juffice to their vaPIlds; but from the
exercise of that po\Ter arose one capital branch of
their revenue; and the emoluments of thneir courts

SECT. I. were frequently the main s~upport of their dignity.

It was with inf~inite zeal that, they asserted and
defended this ~high privilege of their order. By
this institution, howrever, every kingdom in Eu-
rope was [plit into as many separate principalities
as it contained powerful barons. Their vassals,
whi~ether in peace or in war, were hardly sensible
of any authority , but that of their' superior lord.
They felt themselves fubjedS~ to £10 other com-
rnand. They were amenable to no other jurif-
diAion. T~Phe-ties which linked together thes~e
-imaller confederacies became close and firm,'` the
bonds of public union relaxed, or were dissolved.
SThe nobles firained their invention in devising re-
g ulations which tended to ascertain and perpetuate
this diftindtion. In order to guard against any
appea~rance of subordination in their courts to
those of the crown , they confirained their mo-
narchs to prohibit the royal judges from enter-
ing their territories , or from claiming any jurif-
diaion there; and if, either through mistake, or
from the spirit of encroachment, anly royal judge
ventured to extend his authority to the vassals of
a baron, they might plead their~right of exemp-
tion, and the lord of whom they held could not
only rescue them out of his hands , but was inti-
tied to legal reparation for the injury and affroont
offered to him. TThe jurifdi~ion of the royal
judges fearcely reached beyond the narrowv limits
of the King's demelihes. Infitead of a regular gra-
dation of courts , all acknowledgingo the authority
of the fame generallawls, and looking up to these

as the guides of their decisions, there were in SECT.. T,
every feudal kingdom a thousand independent tri-
bunals , the proceedings of which were direded
by local cuf~oms and contradiatory forms. The
colliflon of jurifdiation among these numerous
courts ioften retarded the execution of jui~ice: The
variety and caprice of their modes of procedure
muff have for ever kept the adminiffration of it;
from attaining, any degree of uniformity or per-
fecSion.

AsL the monarchs of Euro~pe perceived the~e ExpEdi~ents

encroachments on their jurifdiaion, and bore them em~ployedi
with impatience. But the ufurpations of the nobles mit or abc-
were so firmly eltablifhed , and the danger of en-tishtsi
deavouring to overturn them by open force w~asi
so manifeR , that they were obliged to remain
satisfied with attempts to undermine them. Vari-
ous expedients were employed for this purpefe;
each of which merits attention, as they mark the
progress of law and equity in the several kingdoms
of Europ~e. At firi2, Princes endeavoured to cir=-
cumfcribe the jurifdiation of the barons , by per-
mitting them to take cognizance only of smaller
off~ences, reserving those of greater moment, under
the appellation of Pleas of the Croton, and Royal
Causes , to be tried in the Kingr's. cour ts. This
aiffeaed only the barons of inferior note ; the more
powerful nobles scorned such a. diftinaion, and
not-only claimed unlimited juriflAmion , but obliged
their s~overeigns to grant thens charters , con-
veying or recognizing this privilege in the mofit;

towards at jurifi~iaion diftina~ fr~om that of thi

~ to, th~e pretenflons of superiority which the crow
claimed over territorial judges ; and taught: then
·when oppressed by their own super-ior lord, to look
·2p to their fe~vereign as their proteAor. Thii
facilitated the introduccion of appeals , by whic
Princes brought the decillons of the barons' court
under· the reviiw ofteoal ugs

the royal judges. W~lhile tria

by combat f~ub~ifted in full vigour , no point de
cided according to that mode, could be brought
under the review of another court. It had been
referred to the judgment of God ; the issue o
battle had declared his will; and it would have'
been impious to· have called in queff~ion the equity
of the divine deciilon. But as soon as that bar·
barous cuffom began to fall into disuse, Princes
encouraged the vassals of the barons to fuxe. for
redress, by appealing to the royal courts T`he
gIrogrefs of this pradice, however, was flow and
graduail. The firflt instances of appeals were on
account of the delay , or the rePfyifal of ju/ljice in the
baron's court ; andi as there were countenanced
by the ideas of faibordination in the feudal con·
ftitution , the nobles allowed them to be intro·
duced without much opposition. But when theft
were followed by appeals on account of the in-
ju/iice or iniquitliy ss7 the fTentnce , the nobles then
began to be sensible, that if this inuovation became

general, the shadow of power ·alone would remain SECT. T
in.their hands, and all real authority and jurif-
didlion would centre in~ thos~e courts which pof-
fCeffed the right of review. They inflantly took
the alarm, remonfirated against the encroachment,
and contended boldly for their ancient privileges.
But the monarchs in the differen~t kingdoms of
Europe pursued their plan with fleadinefs and pru-
dence.' Though forced to s~uspend. their opera-
tions on some occasions, and seemingly to yield
when any formidable confederacy of their vassals
united against them , they resumed their measures
as soon as they obs~erved the nobles to be remiss
or feeble, and pushed them with vigour. They
appointed- the royal courts, which originally were
ambulatory, and irregular with ref~pedk to their
times of meeting, to be held in a fixed place, and
at slated seasons. They were solicitous to nare
judges of more diftingibifhed abilities than such as
presided in the courts of the barons. They added
dignity to their charader , and splendour to their
ass~emblies. They laboured to render their forms
regular , and their decrees consistent. Such judi-
catories became, of cours~e, the objeAs of publick
confidence as well as veneration. The pe~ople,
relinquilhing the partial tribunals of their lords,
were eager to bring every fabjeA of contest under
the more equal and discerning eye of those whom
their sovereign had chosen to give judgment in
his name. T'hus Kin~gs became once more the
heads of the community, and the dispensers of

SIE@. L jutxice to their fi~bjeats. The barons, in foq

k9ingdoms, cealed to .exercis~e their right of juri
d~iaion', because it fIunk into contempt; in othed

naturally from the slate of fCociety at that period,
and had a very serious influence in refining the
manners of the European nations. The feudal oi~rigoyf
itate was a slate of perpetual war, rapine , and
anarchy, during which the weak and unarmed'
were exposed every moment to ~insults or inljuries.
TYhe power of the sovereign was too limited to
prevent these wrongs; and the ad~ministration of
justice too feeble to redress them. T~here was;
fecarcely any proteAion against violence and op-
pref~ion , but what the valour and generosity ofl
private persons afford-ed. Tlhe fame spirit of enter-
prise which had prompted so many gentlemen to
take arms in defence of the loppreffed pilgrims in
Palestine, incited others to declare thems~elves the
patrons and avengers of injured innocence at:
home. Wrhen the final reduAion of the Holy
Land under the dominion of Infidels put a~ end
to these foreign expeditions, the latter was the
only employment left: for the adrivityi and courage

But they imprinted deeply in their rnintis the
principles of g~enerosity and honour. These were
[tt~engthened by every thing that can aiffedt the
senses, or touch the heart. The wild exploits of
those romantic knights who falllied forth in quest
of adlyentures, are wvell known, and have .been
treated. with proper ridicule. The political andi
permanent ·effeAs of the spirit of chivalry have
been less obs~erved. Perhaps, the humanity which
accompani'es all the ~operations of war, the refbine-
ments of gallantry, and the point of honour, th~e
three chief circumff ances which distinguish~ modern
from ancient manners, Imay be ascribed in a great
measure to this whimlical institution, seemingly of
little benmeft to mnankind. TFhe frentimaen ts which
chivalry inspired, had. a wonderful influence on
manners and conduat during the twelfth, th~ir-
teenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. They
were so deeply rooted, that they continued to
operate after the vigour and reputation of the·
institution itself began to decline. Some coni-
derable tranfadions, recorded in the SollowEin g
hiffory, resemble the -adventurous exploits of: chi-
valry, rather than the well regulated operat~ions
of found policy. Some of the most emiq~ent per-

already deferibed . But the evenits and institutions
which I have enumerated, produced great altera-
'tions in society. As soon as their operation, in rel

community , began to be felt , as soon as they be-
gan to communicate to all the members of society
fCome tasse of the advantages arising from com,

which it did not formerly perceive , and fohd: of
occupations or purfulits of which it was formerly~

awakenings from that lethargy in which it had been

mnyfteries, and to decide queltions which the iia
aunited faculties of the humnan m~ind are unable to
comprehend, or to resolve. TThefe over-curious
sp~eculations w~ere incorporated with the syst~em of
re~ligiona, and came to be considered as the most
essential part of it. As soon, then, as curiosity;
prompted men to inquire andE to reason, ·ther~e were
the fabjea5s which first presented thermfelves, and
engaged their attention. Tfihe s~cholastic theology,
with its infinite tra~in. of bold d~ifquifitions, and faub,

'the objea of humary reason, wvas· the first produc-

[ach a wrong turn to the minds of men, when they SECT. T·
began agamn to exercise talents which they h'ad so

to revive literature in the twelfth and thirteenth

principles of frcience from the Greeks in thre eastern
Empire, or from the Arabians in Spain and Africa.
Both the~se people, accute and inquilitive to excess;,
corrupted those ~sciences w'hich they culti~vated.
The former rendered theology a system of fp~ecu-

their being vented the effeats of them from being as extensive

Europe, during the period under review, were bar,
barous. T~heyr were defritute of elegance, of force,
and even of perspicuity. N~o attempt had been
hnitherto made to improve or to polish them. T'he

' Leatin tongue was consecrated by the church to re.

ligion. Cuffom~, with authority fearcely less fa-
cred, had appropriated it to literature. All the
~sc~iences cultivated in the twelfth and thirteentE
centuries, were faug~ht in Latia. All books with

refiped to them were written in t~hat language. T~o SECT. I

of it. This confined science within a veryP narrow
circle. T1he learned alone were admitted into the
temple of knowledge; the gate was shut against

VA1HOUs causes, however, contributed to revive c:aurleaSor~ its

the spirit of commerce, arrd to renewt, in some de.

The Italians, by their conneaeion with Conftanti-.
Snople and other cities of the Greek empire, had
preserved in their own country fCome relish for the
precious commodities and curious manufadtures
of the ]Eaff. T~hey communicated some knowY-
ledge of there to the countries contigtfus ·to Italy.
But this commerce was extremely limited, nor was
the intercourse whi'ch it occasioned betwveen differ-
ent nations considerabl~e. T~he Crusa~des, by Cad&-
ing multitudes from every corner of Europe into
SAfia, opened a more extensive communication be-
tween the EHaft and Wi~eft, wYhichI fabfifted fobr two
;centuries, and though the objpa of these expea
ditions was conquest and not commerce; though
the issue of them proved as unfortunate , as the
motives~ for und~rtaking them were wild and en-
thufiaftic, their commercial eff~eas, as hath been
thewvn, were both beneficial and pe~rmanent. Dur-
ing the continuance of the Cru~ades, the great: citieS
in Italy, and in other· coun'tries of Europe~ acquired
liberty, and together with it such privileges as ren-
dered them refpedable and independent commu-

gour. T~hey attempted new arts, and transplanted
from warmer climates, to which they had been
hitherto deemed peculiar, fCeveral natural produc-

by· their own fkilY, they~difpofed of to g~reat ad-
vantage among the other people of Europe, who
began to acquire some taste of elegance unknown
ot their ancertors, or despised by them.' *During
e he twelfth and thirteenth centuries , the commerce
of Europe was almost entirely in the hands of the
Italians, more commonly known in those ages
by the name of Lombards. Companies or focie-
·ties of Lombard mer-chants fettled in every differ-,
ent kingdom: T~hey were taken under the· imme-

soon after they began to open some trade with these
people, found it necess~ary to enter into a league of
mutual defence. They,derived fulch advantages
from this union, that other towns accede~d to- their·

Europe appear to have considered themselves as
sepa~rate societies, fearcely comiitaed together by~
aLny common intereRt, and little concerned in each·
other's affairs .or operations. Ain extensive com·
merce did, not afford them an opportunity of ob-

fla tion , the operations of one, are ~so, felt b y .all.,
as to influence their counsels and rcegulate their

unless when vlicinity of territory rendered the
oc~casions of discord frequent and unavoidable, or
wshen national emulation fomented or embitterfed
the sp~irit of ho~ility, the affairs of different coun,
~tries are feldomn interwtovren. In` each ktingdom of

progrelds which was made towards rendering one afairs of

France.

S~ECT.II. Pribee the maitter of both there kingdoms, hard

Th'erDukes of Burgundy and Bretagne , whif
-their situation would no~t pefrmiit: to remainI neutra
engaged, it is true, -in the con~test; but in takin
their pa~rt, they s~eem- rather to have followed t
impulse of their patirons, th~an to have been gi~de
by an~y just discernment of the danger whib
threatened· themselves and the tranquillity

SEurope. The other Princes, see~mingly unaffee

,byT the alternlate fiucceff~es of the contending pa
ties, left them to decide the quarrel, or interpzof
only by feebl~e an~d ineffectual n~egociations.

From thore NJOTWITHSTA4NDING the ~perp~etual hoff~ilities i
Of spain' which the various kingdoms of Spain were engage

d·urinig several cenMturTi-S, and the s~uccess~ive occu
renc~es which visibly tended to unite that part oft
.continent into one great mronarchy, the Princes o
Europe [carcely took a sing~le Rtep, which difcove
that they gave any attention to that important
event. ~They permitted a power to arise impercep;
tibly, and to acquir~e Itrength there, which foca
became formidable to all its neighbours.

From thore AMiDsT the violent convulfrons with which t~he
or Germany·. sp~irit of. domination in the See of R~ome, and' the

Sturbulent ambition of the German nobles, agitated
. the Empire , neither the authority· of the Popes,

seconded by .all their artifices and intrigues , nor

the folicitations of the Emperors, could induce SacTll
anY of the powerful monarchs in Europe to engage
,in their quarrel, or to avail thems~elves of many
favourable opportunities of interpoling with. effed
andl lad~vantage.

Tmras amazing inanivity, during tranfia~ions frO This inaci

;interesting, is not to be imputed to any incapacity tivity occa
of discerning their political consequences. The f~e 4en"l
flower of judging with sagacity, and of ading with ea~te of go-
vigour , is the portion of men in every age. Thle ver"ment.
IV~onarchs who reigned in the diff'erent kingdoms
of Europe during several centuries were not blind
to their particular interest, negligent of~ the publick
faifety, or strangers to the method of feecu~ring both.
If they did not adopt that salutary fyfitem, which
teach-es modern politicians to ta~ke the alarm at the
profped of distant dangers, which prompts therm
to check; thne firlt encroachments of anly formidable
power , and.which renders each state the guardian,
in7 s~ome degree , of the rights and independence of
all its neighbours , this was owing entirely to such
imperfe~tions and disorders in the civil government
of each country , as made it imposs~ible for fover-
eigns to arS faitably to those ideas, which the
posture of affairs , and their own observation,
muff have fugg~efied.

' BUT during th~e cours~e of the fjfteenth century,xvents hap.
various events happened, which , by givinlg P-rinces p.n?' e th

oi- to preserve fuchi a balance of power as was moff'
conf~ifent with the general security. It was during
the: reign of Charles the Fifth, that the ideas, o
·which this fyi~em is founded, first came to be full!
rkinderftobd. It was then, that the maxims by ·which
it has been uniformly maintained s~ince that aera5

of the causes and events whi'ch contribjuted to efta~
blifh a plan of policy ·more fralutary andl extensive
than .any that .has ·taken place in the condua of
human affairs, is not on~ly a neceffaryr introduation:

lShishofitehseir which England poffeftd on the continent , to the
onl the con. crown of France. Wrhile the English were masters
tinent. of several of the most fertile and opulent provinces

jin France, and a great part of its most martial
inhabitants was bound to follow their standard,
an English monarch considered hims~elf rather as
- the rival, than as the vass~al 6f the fevereign of

w~hom he held. -The Kings of France, circum·

Bribed and- thwarted in their schemes and opera-. SECT.I .
tions by an adversary no less jealous than formid-
able, durit not: venture upon~ anly enterprize· of
importance or of diffculty. The ;English~ v ere
always at haird, ready to oppo~se them. They ~dif
puted even their right to their crown,. and being
able to henetrate, with ease, into the heart los the
kingdom, could arm against them thos~e very hands
v ~hich ought to have been employed in their
defence. ~Timid counsels and feeble efforts were
naturral to maonarchs in fuIch a situation. F'rance,
di~smembered and overawed, could not attaini its
proper Rtation ih the fyfi-em of Europe. But; the ;
death of Henry V. of England , happily for France,
and not un~fortunately for his own country, deli-
vered the French from the calamity of having a
foreign master se~ated on their throne. T~he weak-
ness of a long minority, the diffenflons in the
English court, together with the un~teady and
languid conduA which there occaflo~ned,· afforded
the French a favourable opportunity of recovering
the territories which they had 10ft. The native
valour of the French nobility heightened to an
enthufialtick confidence, by a. supposed interpo-
fition of lieaven in their behalf ; conduated in' the

Tshe effet a As soon as to8 many considerabl~e province~s wa~ere
of this on re-united to their dominio~ns, the Kings of Franice;
the poer n;;;''~kfof CODious of this acqui~ition ·of irength, began to
the French form bolderi schemes of interior policy-, as well as
mnonarchy. of foreign operations. They immed~iately became

fortnicla~ble to their neighbours, who began to ~fk
their attention on their meaiitres and motions·, the:
importatnce of which they fully perceiv~ed. Frone:
this eera , France , poffelled of the advantages~
which it derives from the situation and contiguity
of its territories, as well as from the number andl
vsalour of its people, refe to new :influence in
Europe, and was the firrt power in a conditioni:
to give alarm to the jealoufyr or fears of the
states arounde it.

the nation. wbhich had boee~n torn from it.i A circuinflance

attended the recovery of these, which, though less
considerable, and less observed, contributed not ae
little to give additional vigour~ and dec~iion to all
the efforts of that monarchy. During the obstinate
firuggles between France and England, all the
defec~s- of the military fyftemr under the ffuzdal
·government were sensibly ·felt. A war of long
continuance languished, when carried on by troops

" bound and accustomed to keep the field only for

B few wveeks. Armies, composed chiefly of· heavyl SC T IL
armed cavalry, were unfit either for the attack or
the defence of the many towvns and cail~es, which
it became necess~ary to guard or to reduce, In or-
de~r to obtaini such permanent and effedtive force,
as became requisite during thefe.'lengthened con-·
tests, the Kings of France took into their pay con·
fiderable binds of mercenary soldiers, levied some-
titmes among their own futbjeats, and sometimes in
fo~eign; countries. But as the feudal policy~p~rovided
so fhfficient fund for such extraordinary service,
tjnefe adventurers were dismissed at the clotfe of
e'rery campaign, or upon anly profped of a~ccom·
modatiorn; and having been little accu~tomed to
the reitraints':f discipline, they frequently turned
their arms against the country which they had
been hired to defend, and desolated it with no
less cruelty than its foreign enemies,

A ~BODY of troops kept constantly on foot, and re oceainns

- the iilnto-

regularly trained to military fu~bordmnat on, wouldduain of
have supplied what was wanting in the eudal con·itanding
ftitution, and have furnished ]Princes with the means amues.
of executing enterprizes, to which they were then
uneqjual. Such an establishment, however, was so
repugnant to the genius of feudal policy, and so
incompatible with the privileges and pretehflons
of the nobility , that: during several centurie's no
monarch was either so bold , or so powerful, as
to venture on any fiep towards introducing it. At
last, Charles VII. acvailing himself of the reputation
Which he had acquired by is [ucceffe against the

terror wich fach a formidable enemy had left upio
theriinindsiof his -fiubjedis, executed that which hi~i:

payiment of thefe;'ihe Rtat~ioned them in diffferena
places of the kingdoim, according to his spleafurel
and.appointed the officers, whio commanded andt
disciplined th~em.: Th~e primre nobility courted this
service, in~ which theyi were taught; to depend off
t~heir sovereign , to execute his orders , and ta
look' up to him as the judge and rewarder of
their~ merit. The feudal. militia, conipof~ed of the
va~ssals whiom the nobles couL~ld call out to follow
their flandard, as it was in no degree comparable
Sto a body 'of sol~diers regularly trained to wyar;
f~unk grad~ially in reputation. The - frength of
armies came to ·be estimated onlyT by the number
of disciplined men which th~ey contained. In lefi
than a century , the nobles and their military
tenants, though. sometimes f~umnmoned to the field,
according to anc ent form , were .colifidered as
, an. incumbrance upon the troops wiith which they
Sadted; and were viewued with contempt by fA
diers adccuffomed to the vigorous and Rteady
tiperations of regular service.

THvs t~he reg~ulations of Charles the Seventh, by Sset. Ite

db~iblifhiing the first R~anding army knownI in Eu- ne ereats
supe .occasioned an important revolution in its ofthis.
Ia~fairs anld policy; By deprivin~g the nobles of that.
dirdlion of the national military force of the R~ate:,
whki~h had raised thern to such high authority and.
i-iixportance, a deep wound was given to the feudal
iai~ftocracy, ini that part where its power seemed to
be mos~t comp~let~e.

FRBN·CE, by forming this body of regular troops,
.at a time when there was hardly a squadron ·or
ponjpany kept in constant pay in any other part of
Europe, acquired such advantages over its neigh-
:burs, either,in attack or defence, that f'elf-pre-
servation made it; necessary for them to imitate its
example. I~iercenary troiops were introduced into
El~l the conf~deerable ]kingdomis on the continent.
They gr~adually became the only military force that
was employed or truited. It has long been the:
chief objeat of policy to increafe.and to support;
them. It has long been the great aim of Princes
alid miniffers to discredit and to annihilate all other
`means~ of national adtivityz or defence,

ACs the Kings of France got the start of o'ther me We-

:powers in eitablifhmng a military force in their do. narchs ofl
;·ininons, which- enabled them to carry· on foreign couraged tol
Bgperations wtith more ~vigour , and to greater eX. extend theie!

~IVany things concurred to ;un'dermine, graduazlly,
th'e power of the feudal aristocracy in 1Franice. TPhe!
swealth and pi-operty of the nobility were, greatly
imnpaired during the long wars which the kingdom
was obliged to maintain with the English. The
extraordinary zeal with which they exerted thern-
selves in defencez of theiir country against its an-
cient enemies, exhausted the foritunes of some great
famflies. As almbft every province in the k~ing.
dom was, in its turn, the feat of war, the lands of
others were exposed to the depredations of the
enemny, wrere ravaged by the mercenary troops
;ihich theirdovereigns hired occaflonally, but could

the entire comimand of his kingdom. He3e himself
hiad added considerably to the ,extent of his do-
minions , by his prudent marriage wi~th the heiress
of Bre~tagne , which rendered -him master of that-

to be annexed to the crown. H3e fodon affemblerd

order to adjust the int~erests , and baalance the powyer
of the different Rtates into which Italy was divided,
they were engaged in perpetual and endle~ss nego-

with all the subtlety of a refining and deceitful
policy. T3hedir contest~s in .the field, when they
had recour~e. to arms, were decided in mock bat-·
tles, by innocent and bloodle~ss viatories. Upon
the first appearance of the danger which now im-

proach. T'he impetuosity of the French valout'
appeared to.them irrefiftiblei Florence, Pisa, and
Rome opened their gates as the Fr~nch army
advanced. The profpedt of this dreadful invasion
struck one King of Naples with s~uch panic terrot,;
that he died (ifive may believe hifforians) of the
fright. Another abdicated -his~ throne from the
fame pusillanimous spirit. A third fled out of

'I ;this· dominions., as soon as the enemy appeared on

thither from the bottom of the Alps, with as
mrruch rapidity , a~nd almost as little opposition, as
if he had been on a progres~s through his own

resist the impreEtion of the enemy which broke in
upon them, permitted$ him to*· hold on his course
undisturbed. They quickly perceived that no
single power , which they could rouse to adtion,
. was an equal match for a monarch, who ruled
o9ver such ex'tenfive territories, and was at the
head of such a mnartial people·; but that a con~f<-

deracyr might accomplish wNhat the separate rnem- SECT.j
bers of it durst not' attempt. To this expedient,
the only one that remained to delifter or to pr~e-
feirve them fr~om the yoke, they had recourse.
While Charles inconsiderately wasted· his time at
Nraples in festivals and triumphs on account of
his paft' fuccelfes , or was fondly dreamin-g of Jfu-
ture conqueits in the East, to the empire of which
he now aspired, they fosrmed against him a fpowerl
ful combinaltion of almost all1 the Itaeliarn iRates ,
~supported by the ]Ersperor MrIaximilian, and Ser-
dinand K~ing of Aragon. Tfhe union of so many
powers, who fdufpended or forgot all their parti-
sular animolities, that they might aA with con-
cert agai'nft an enemy who had become f~ormaidable
toi them all, awakened Charles from his thoright-
les~s secur-ity. He saw now no profpedt of s~afety-
but in returning to France. An army of thirty
thousand men , assembled by the allies , was ready
to obffruat his march; and though the French,
with a daring courage, whic~h more than counter-
balanced their inferiority in liumber, broke through
that great body, and gained a viatoryT, which
opened to their monarch a safe passage into his
own t~erritories , he was firipped of all his con-
quests in .Italy in as short a time as it had taken
to acquire them; and the political system in that
country resumed the fame appearancy as before
his invasion.

a proper diffribution of power among all the me~m-

are formned. DBuring all' the wars of which Italy
~from~ that time 'was the th~eatr~e, and amidst the
hofb!ile operat~ions which the imprudence of
3Louis XIII. and the atmbition of Ferdinand of Ara-·

who~ appeared on this new theatre of adion , ta
eftablifb the military force of their kingdoms on·

~feat of wsar came to be remote fr~om the countr~ies
which maintained thie contest, thte service of the'
feudal' vassals ceafede to be of any use; and the ne-
cefity of employing troops ibegularly trained to
arms, and kept in conflant pay,; came at once to
be evident. W~hen Charles marched 'into Italy,
his cavalry was entirely comnpof~ed of those com-
:panies of G'end~armes., embodied' by Charl'es VIL,
.and continued by Lou~is XI.; his infantry consisted
partly of Swvifs, hiredt of the Canrtons, and partly
of' Gaf~cons, armed and dif'cipined after the Swits
mod~er. To there Louis XII. added a bjody of
G~ermans, well known in the wars of Italy by the

pean sations. 1During their long and violent ftrug-
gles in defence of their liberties agalint the house
of Austria,: whose armies, like thos~e of other con,.
fi'derable Princes, confrited chiefly of heavy-armed
qgavalry , the Swi~ifs found that their pover ty,, and
the small number of gentlemen residing in their
countyy, at that time ba~rren and ill cultivated, put
it out ,of their power to bring into the field, any
SBody of horse capable of facing the enemy. Ne-
cefi~ty compelled them to place all their confidence
in infantry; and 'in order to render it ca~pable.0f

which had been long ex~ploded, of its superior im-
portance in the operations of war. But the glory
which the Swifsh had: acquired~, having inspired thern
with such high ideas of their own p~rowess and
confeqixence as frequently rendered them mutinous

while armies were composed of military vaffas
called forth .to attack fomei neighbouring power,
and to perform , in a fhort'campaign, the services-
w~iich they owed to their fovereigSn, the expency
of war was extremely moderate. A sm~all fabfidy
enabled a Prince to begin" and to finish his greatefe

p erations. But when I~tay became the theatre on SECT'. a1

$by creating demands unknown in less aitive times,
cilbiltiplied taxes in every kin~gdom. T~he progress

the powers who united in this confederacy. The
civil constitution of Venice, established on a firr

d'everal centuries; during which , the f'enate coi
duaed its affairis by maxims of policy no lefCs pru

uniform consistent [pirit, whi'ch gave that commog
wealth great advantage over other slates, whos!

of their government, or the persons who admini

Si~ered it. By these urgntermittdd exertions of wii

IU~lius II. whose ambition was superior, and his acbi-
lities equal, to those of any Pontiff who ever fat
on the Papal throne, formed the idea of this league
against the Venetians, and endeavoured, by apply-

persuade other Princes to join in it. By w~orking
upon the fears of the Italian powvers, and upo~n the

of talsate AT the opening- of the sixteenth century, the

pTolitical face ·of 'Italy ~was extremely different from·
thiat of anly other part ;of Eur~ope. Inficead of
~thoTe- exte~nsive monarchies, whi'ch occupied the
reft of the ·contin~ent, that delightful! country was
·pa~rce~lled.·out among manyr small Rtates, ·each of
which poffeff~ed sovereign and indep~endent- jurif-
<idtion. T~e ·only monarc=hy in Italy Was thlat of
Napl~es. The do-minion of the Popes was -of a
$eculiar fipecies, to which there is nothing: similar
.··it~her inancient or modern times. In13 Veni~ce and

:Florench, a' republican form of gov·ernment wats SEidr. 11?.
·iffablifhed. Milan was f~ubjeat to fevee~ignls, who
:had ·assumed no higher title than that of D~ukes.

THE Pope wYas the first of these powers i~n dgig~ne rapal:

hlity, anId not the least considerable b~y the extenta~ignit the
dif his territories. In ·the primitive~ church., the Europe.
jurif~diaion of bishops was equal and co-ordiinate.
They derived, perhaps, some degree of confider-
ation from the~ dignity of the See in vihich they·
presided. They poffelfed, however, no reat au-
thority or pre-eminence, but: what they acquired
by superior abilities, or fCuperior fandity. As
RPomie had s~o long been the fieat of empire, and
I·'apital of thie wvorld, its bishops wIere ~On that origin- ana
ticcount entitled· to refpen; they receivediit; bu pace,'~I ~
during several ages they claimed and' received~no- powetv.
thing more. From thes~e humble beginnings, they-
advanced with~ such an adventu~rous and wells-
;dired5ed ambition, that they establish ed a fp~irituat
domini~on over th~e m~inds and fati'ments of men,
io which all Europe submitted with implicit obe-
die~nce.. Their· claim of ukniverfal jurif~dialon, as-
heads of the church, and their pretenflons to in-.'
fallibility in their de'cifion~s, as faucceffors of St.
Peter, are ~as chimerical, as they are repugnant to
the genius of the Christian relr gion. But on these-
fbixndations, the superstition and credulity of man-
kind enabled them to erea2 an a-mazing super-
ftruau~Lre. In all ecclesiastical controversies, their

beiflons were received, as the i~nfallible ora~cles ofL
truth. Nor was the plenitude of their power- con-

Saw.r HII.: fined~ to there alone; they dethroned monarc~hs;~

~ifp~ofed- of crowns; absolved fubjeats fro~m the·
obsedience due to their fevereignss; anld ];aid king-
doms~ under interdiaes. Thtere w~as not a state in·
·Europe phic~h had not been di~quieted by their
ambition. Thiere wa~s no~t a. throne, which they,
had not thaken; nor, a, Prince, who did not trems,
ble at their power.

adequate to Civil authorit~y, but: that .the· Popes thould have·
fuplport Greirpolleffed~ s~uch a degree of temporal power, as.
Spiritual ju-
ttaiition. was jfufficient to second and enforce their ~p~irituaka~

d'ecrees. Ha~ppily for mank~ind, while their f~pi
ritural jurifdiation was moR extentive., and at its
greateRt heigh~t, their temporal. property was ex-.
tremely limited;. 'They were powerful Pontiffs,
forlmidable at a dliftance; but they were petty
Prines, without any considerable do~meitick jfoce-.

d TPhey had early endeavoured, indeed, to acqluire·

territory bjy arts, fimilatr to those which they had:
- e~mployed· in extending their jurif~didion.. Under~
preten~ce of a donatilonfom onatendo
anoth~er from Charlemangne or his father Pepin,
they attempated to tak;e pof~ifemoni of fon>'e towYns
adjac-ent to Rome. But~ these donations were fidi.l
tious, and availed them littl~e. ThTe benefad~ions,
for which they were indebted to· the credulity of
the Norman adventurers, w-ho conquered N\aples-,
and to the fuper~itionz of the countess IV~a~tida,

wlyere real, a~nd added ample domnains- to. the SECT. E
-lolyr See.

BUtr the power of thle Popes did, not increase in Their adi

proportion to the- extent of territory which they thority s
had acquired. In the dominions annexed to the ted,,ioie
Holy See, as well as in those futbjea to other eptremely
Princes in Italy, the sovereign of a state was far umited.
·from having the command of the force which it
contained.; Diuring the turbulence and confusion
of the~ middle ages, the powerful noboilityl or~
leaders of popular fadtions in Italy, had seized :the:
gobvernment of different towns; and after fire-ngth,
ening their fortificationas, and takin~ga body of
mercenaries into pay, they aspired at indepen-
dence. T~he territory which the church had gained,
was filled with petty tyrants of this kind, who left
the Pope hardly the ~shadow of dominion.

HyE genius of the papal governm~ent, however, nefests in

fi~tiics were so formaed, th-at: the charad~er of the
idividual was fuink. in that of the profellion; and
te pallions of the man were facriliced to the interel;
d honour of the order. T~he hands which held
e reins of adminiltratiori might change; but
~e sp~irit which conduated thernh was always the
me. W5hile the meas~ures of other governments
it~uated, and the objeas at which they aimed
t~ied, the church kept; one end in view; and
to- this unrelaxing conflancy of pursuit, it was.
Itidebted for its, success in the boiuldef acttemptsj
ever made by human ainbition.

BUT in their civil adminiffration , the Popes fol-
lowed no such uni~for~m or. confliftent plan. Tlhere
as in other governments, the charader, the pas-
fions, and the interells of the person who had the
supreme dire~tion of affairs , occa~floned a variation

As Ecclefiafticks were traired to pacifick aff~t

and e~ary initiat~ed in cthe myf-teriles of thatc poll~
b~y which the court of Rome extendeyl or~f'
ported its Ipirittral dominion, the Popes were-'
to conduA their temporal affairs with the fai
sp~irit; and in all their meafurres were more read
to employ the refinements of intrigue , than ti
force of arms. It was in the Papal court ~tln

~As the dlecorum of their ecclesiastical charadei

prevented the Popes from p~lacing themselves it

they were afraid to arm their f~ubjed~s; 'and in''11r

vTolutioPns which happened in that monarchy, had
considerably increafed'ther~e defeaes, and rendered
them rnmore int~olerable. Tkhe f~uccet~ion to' the
cro~wn of Naples had been so often interrupted or
altered, and so m~any Princes of foreign blood had
t~aken poffeffioon of the throne, that the N~eapolitan
nzobility had 10£1, in a great measure, that attach-
anent to the family of their sovereigns, as w~ell as
that reverence for their pers~ons, which, in other
fCeudal kingdoms, contributed to set some bounds
to the encroachments of the barons upon the royal
prerogative and power. At the fame time, the
different pretenders to the crown, being obliged to
court the barons who adhered to them, and on
whose s~upport they depended for the s~uccess of
their claims, they augmented their privileges by
i~beral conacet~ions, and connived at their boldest
ufuirpations. Even when seated on the throne, it
ws~as dangerous for a Prince, who held his sceptre
by a disputed title, to venture on any fiep towards
extending his own power, or c~ircumfecribing that
a£~s the nobles.

authority of its M~onarchs the least extenfrve.

attempted to break the power of the aristocracy;
though his s~on Alphonfo, -that: he might crush it at:
once by cutting offthe. leaders of greatest repu-.
tation and influence among the Neapolitan ~bacrons,
ventured to commit one of the most perfidious
and cruel ac~tions recorded in hiffory;.;the order ofA.v

, BUT during the firuggle among t~o- many conij
petitors, the prize for which they contended wa
seized by one from whom bione of them apprei
hlended any danger. Francis Sforza, the natural
son of J~acomu~zzo Sforza, whom his courage and;
abilities had elevated from the rank of a peasant to
be one of the most eminent and powerful of thed
Italian Condottieri, having succee~ded his father in:
the command of the adventurers who followyed i
his flandard, had married a natural daughter oP
the last D~uke of Milan. UQpon this thadowv of a;,

as placed him at last on the ducal throne. The
virtues as well as abilities with which he governed,·
inducing9 his fubljec~s to forg~et the defeas in his;
title, he transmitted his dominions quietly to his
son; from whom they deifcended to his grandson.
He wras murdered by his grand uncle LudSovio,

·LtUls XI[. who took pleasure in depr~e~ffng the
)rinces of the blood, and: who adizired the poli-
ical abilities of Francis Sforzix, would not; permit
he ~Duke of Orleans to take any fiep in prose-
istion of his right to the dutchy of Mpilan. Lu-
lidvico the M2~oor kept up such a close coninedion
sith Charles VIll. that, during the grea~ter part of
iis reign, the claire of the family of Orleans con-
hinied to lie dormant. Biut when the crow7n of
Etance devolved to Louis XII. DSuke of Orleans,
be inftnantly affertedl the rigohts of his family witha

A considerable part of the people retainedi such a.

of cities seem to have obtained a feat very early
in the Cortes of Cai~ile, and soon acquired such
influence and credit, as were very uncommon, at a
period when the splendour and pre-eminence of thte
nobility had eclipsed or anlnihilated all other orders
of men. The number of members from cities
bore su~ch a proportion -to that of the whole col-
ledlive body, as rendered them extremely respect.~

dleration, which they poffeffred in the state, may be
effimated by one event. Upon the death of John I. ^ n. as,.

'extrem~ely' high. There was not any body of nobi-
lity i~n Europe more~ distinguish~ed for independence
of spirit, haughtiness of deportment, and bold pre-
teenflons, than that of Castile. The hiffory of that
monarchy affords the most .firiking exampl~es of
the vigilance with which they observed~, and of the
vig~our with which they opposed everyr scheme of
their Kings, that tended to encroach on their ju·
rifdiaion, to diminish? their dignity , or to abridgp
their p~ower. Even in their ordinary in~tercourse·
waith their MVoriarchs, they preserved fuceh a conf~ci-

Monarchs. Isabella, wll dis~cover the causes to wihich all the

peculiarities in its political conflitution I have
pointed out, ought: to bce ascribed.

As the provinces of Spain were wrested from SzeT.II

the'IMahomnetans gradually amd with difificulty, the
nobles, who followed the standard of any eminent
leader in there wars, conquered not for him alone,
but for them~selves. T~they claimed a sh~are in the
lands which their valour had torn from the enemy,
and their profjperity and power increas~ed, in pro-
portion as the territory of the Prince extended.

DuxuINo their perpetual wars with the Ma/oors,

the Mionarchs of Spain depended so much on their
vobles, that it became necessary to conciliate their
good will by success~ive grants of new hol7ours and
privileges. By the thne that any Prince could
establish his dominion in a .conquered province,
the greater part of the property was parcelled out
by him among his barons, wi~th sauch jurifd~iaion
and immunities, as raised them almoff to fhovereignr
power.

AT the fame time, the kingdoms erec~ed in to
mnany different corners of Spain, were extremely
inconsiderable. T~lhe petty monarch was but lit-
die elevated above his nobles. T~hey, feeling them-
selves to be almost~ his equals, adted as fach. The
Kings of ~such limited domains could neith~er com-
mand- much respect, nor possess~ great power, andP
noblemen, so nearly on the fame level, could not
look up to them with that reverence, with which
the sovereigns of the great monarchies inl Europe
were viewved by their fubjeds ( LL)2,

SECT. III. - THESE circumstances concurred in exalting the

nobility , and in depressing the royal authority;
there were other causes` wihich raised the cities in
Spain to consideration and power.

As the open country, duri~ng the wars with the

IMoors, was perpetually exposed .to the excurflons
of the enemyl with whom no peace or truce was
fob permanent as to prove any lasting security, self-
Spre~fervation obliged persons of all ranks to fix
their refidlence in places of firength. The caffles
of the barons, which, in other countries, aAforded
a commodious retreat from t'he depredations of
banditti, or from the transient violence of anly in-
terior commotion, were unable to resist an 'enerny
whose operations were conduaed with regular and
p~erfeverinsg vigour. Cities, in which great num-
ber-s united for' their mutual defence , were the
only places in which people could fix their refi-
denice with any pro-fped of safety. To this wivas
owing the rapid growth of those cities in Sp'ain
of which the Christians recovered poff~emon. All
who fled from the Moorifhl yoke resorted to themn,
as to an asylum; and there, the greater part -of
thos~e who took the field a gainft the Mahometans
eftabr1ilhed their families.

EAnH of there cities, during a longer or shorter

course of years, was the capital of a little fitate,
and enjoyed all the advantages which accelerate.
th~e increase of inhabitants in ever-y place thatis the
feat of government.

THE number of cities in Spain, at th~e begin- SECT.- Il

ning of the fifteenth century , was considerable,
and they were peopled far beyond the proportion
which ivas co, non in other parts of Europe, ex-
cept in Italy and the Low-Countries. The M~oor~s
had introduced. manuf~ad~ures into tho~se cities,
while under their dominion. The Christians, who,
by intermixtuzre with them, had learned their arts,
continued to cultivate these. T~he trade of several
of the Spanish towns appears to have been con-
fiderable, and the spirit of commerce continued
to preserve the number of their inhabitants, as
the sense of danger had firlt induced thern to
crowd together.

ACs the Spanish cities were populous, many 0f

the inhabitants wiere of a. rank s~uperior to those
who refded in towns in other countries of Europe.
TIhat cause, which contributed chiefly to their
population, affea~ed equally persons of every con-
dition, w~ho flocked thither promiscuously, in order
to find sh~elter, or in hopes of rnaking a stands
there' against the enemy , with greater advantage
than in any other station. The persons elefed as
their reprefrent~atives in the Cortes by the cities,.0r
promoted to offices of trust and dignity in the
government of the community, were often, as will
appear. from tranfaaions which I shall hereafter
relate, of fulch considerable rank in the kingdom,
as reflecaed ·luffre on their conltituents, and on thbe
stations wherein they were placed.

BECT. llLr As it was impossible to carry on a continual

wear againRt the Mjoors, without some other mnili·
~tary force, than that wi3hich the barons- were obliged

of the K~nights of the Order, and placed the per- Sac'r.IIIL,

willing that the nobility, whom he considered as
already too formidable, should derive fach addi-
tional credit and influence from pol~fefing the
government of thes~e wealthy fraternities, was soli-
citous to· wrest it out: of their hands j and to treft
it in the crown. His meas~ures for accomplishing A; ·tt. ten
this, were wifely planned, and executed with vi- ana i"'31

he prevailed on the Knights of each Order to

o opp-ose them, the frequent civil wars between the

crown and the nobility, as well as the undifcerning
rage with wvhich the barons carried on their private
w~jars with each other, filled all the provinces of
Spain with disorder. Riapine, outrage, and mur·
der, became so common, as not only~ to interrupt
commerce, but in a grreat measure to furpyend all
intercourse ·betw\een one place and another. TPhat:
fdecurity6 and prote(5ion which maen expedt from
.entering into civil society, ceased almost totally.
I[nter~ior order and police, while the feudal inftitu·
tions remained in vigour, were so little objeats of
attention, and the adminiffration of justice was so
extremely feeble, that it would bhave been vain to
have expedted relief from the established laws of
the ordinary judges. But the evil became so in·
tolerable, and the inhabitants of cities, who wtere
the chief fufferers , gred' so impatient of this
anarchy, that f~elf-prefervation, forced them to have

,,s recourse to an extraordinary remedy. About the

milddle of the thirteenth century, the cities in -the
kingdoin of Aragon, and after their 'example
·those in Cast-ile, fo~rmed :thmfelves into an affa

ciation, d~itinguifhed by the name of the H~olY SECT. II;
B~roth"erhood. They exaded a certain contribution
from each of the affobciated towns; they levied a
considerable body of troops, in order to proted5
tr~avellers, and to pursue criminals; they appointed
judges, who opened their 'courts mn various parts
of the kingdom. Wahoever ivas guilty of murder,
robbery , or of any aA that violated the pu'blick
peace, and was seiz~ed by the troops of the Brothier-
hood, was carried before judges of their nomination,
wvho, without payring any regard to the exclusive
and faviereign jurifdiaion which the lorid of the
place might claim, tried and condemned the crim-ni-
nals. Bey means of this, the prompt a~nd impartial
adeniniffration of juffice was reflored; and together
with it, internal tranquillity and order beg-an tat
r-eturn. T~he nobles alone murmured at this falu-
tary ini~itution. They complained of it as an
encroachment on one of their molt valuable privi-
leges. T~hey r~emonfirated agrainft it in an high
~tone; and, on some occallons , refuf'ed to grant.
any aid toi the crown , unless it were a~bolished.
Ferdinand, however, was s~ensible not only of the
good effeas of the Holy B~rotherhood with refped
to'the police of his kingdoms, but: perceived its
tendency to abridge , and at length to annihilate
the territorial jurifdiaion of the nobility.' H31e coun-
tenanced the institution on every occasion. H-e sup-
ported it with the whole force of royal authority;
and besides the expedients -employed by him in
common wvith the other monarchs of Europe ,

$ECT. 111s he availed himsel~f of this institution, which was

peculiar to his kingdom, in order to limit and~abo-
Jilh that independent juri~d~iAion of the nobility,
·which was no less inconsistent with the authority of
the Prince , than with the order of society ( OO ).

~ian non fiderably enlarged the boundaries' of prerogative,
covernment and acq~uired a degree of influence and power far
or sp~aini' be and what any of his predecessors had enjoyed,
,tee.- yet the limitations of the royal authority, as well as

the barriers a~gainst its encroachments, continued
to be many and firong.' The spirit of liberty was
vigorous among the people of Spain; the spirit:
of independence was high among the nobility;
aLnd though the love of glory , peculiar to the
Spaniards in every period of th~eir hiflory, prompted
them to s~up~port Ferdinand with zeal in his foreign
operations, and to afford him such aid as enabled

of eleaing Kings,' of en~ading -lawis, of red'refirng
grievances, of conferring donations on the· Prince,
of passing judgment in the last res~ort, with ref~ped *
to every person and to ever y cause , ,resided in
this great convention of .the nation. Under the Undrer the
beond race of Kings, notwithstanding the power second.
and splendour which the conquests of Char-lemagne
added to the crown, the general assemblies of thae

Og

Sack. III. nations: continued to posses~s extensive authority.

The right of determining which of the royal fa-
mily thould be placed on the throne, was vefied
in them. The Princes elevated to that dignity by:
their fuffrage were accustomed .regularly· to call
and to consu~lt: them with refpedt to every affair
of importance to the [tate, and without their con*
sent no law was pass~ed, and no new tax was levied,

d7nder the But, by the time that HI-ugh Capet, the father
third. of the third race of Kings, took poffefiron of the

throne of France , fuchp changes had happened in
the political Rtate of the kingdom, as considerably
affeaed the power and jurifdidcion of the general
assembly of the nation. T~he royal authority inm
the hands of the degenerate poiterityr of Charle-
arnagne, had dwindled into insignificance and con-
tempt. Every considerable proprietor of land had
formed his territory into a barony, almoff: inde·
penden~t of the sovereign. THhe dukes or gover-
nlors of provinces , the counts or governors of towns
and fmnall diffriAs, and the great officers of the:
crown, had rendered these dignities, originally
granted only during pleafulre or for life, heredfitary
in their families. Each of these had. usurped all
the rights which hitherto had been deemed the
diftinations of royalty , particularly the privileges
of dispensing juffice wvithin their own domains, of
coining money, and of waging war. Every diffridt:
was go~verned by local customs, acknowl~edgred a
diftinat lord, and pursued a s~eparate interest. The;
formality of doing homage to their sovereign, was

almoRt the only act of fulbjection, which haughty SECT. i
barons would p~erform, and* that bound them no
'farther than they were willing to acknowledge its
obligation (PP) .

IN a kingdom broken into so many independlentsh power

baronies, hardly any common principle of union ,of thae Gend~
remained; and the general a(Tfembl~y in its delibe- bly less co:
rations could fEarcely· confider: the nation as forming neerab'e at
one body, or establish~ common regulations to be of
equal force in every par t. TWithin the imm-ed~iate
domains of the crown the King might publifha
laws, and theyr were obeyed, because there he was
acknowTledged as the only lord. But if he had
aiimed at rendering these general,· that wou~ld have
alarmed' the bar~ons as an encroachm~ent~ upon the
independence of their jurifdia5ion. T~he barons,
wlith no less care , avoided the enadting of general
laws, becauf'e the ex~ecution of them must have
been vefied in the King, and would have enlarged
that paramount power, which was the objeaf of
their jealousy. 'Thus under the des~cendants of
H~ugh Capet, the States General ( for that was the
name by which the supreme affiembly of the French
na~tion came then to be distinguished ) loft their-
legifla tive authority, or at least entirely relinqnifh~edl

~As ' during several centuries the monarchs of
Eur~ope seldom demanded extraordinary subsidies of
their fCubjeats, and the other events which required
thle interposition of the States, rarely occurred,
their meetings in France were not frequent. Tl[hey
were s~ummoned occatlonally by their KCings, when
compelled by their wants .or by their fears~ to have
recourse to their aid ; but: they did not, ilike the·
~Diet in Germ~any, the Cortes in Sp'ain, or the Par-
liament in England, form an essential member of
the constitution , the regular exertion of w~hose
'powers -was requisit~e to give vigour and order
t~o goveirnment.'

The crown ih]H[EN the StlteCs of F~rance ceased to· exercjife
,6uire regic ~leg-islative authority, the Kings began to assume it.
lative au- T~heyr ventured ~at first on ads of legislation with
enority, great reserve; and after taking every precaution

that could prevent their fubjedts from being alarmed
-at the exercise of a new power. They did not at:
once iflfue their ordinances in a tone of authority
and command. They treated with their utb~jeats;
they pointed out what was best; arid allured them
·tb comply with it. By degrees, however, as ·the
prerogative of the crown extended, and as the fu-
prem~e jurif~diaion of the royal courts came to be

etnablifhed, the Kings of France assumed more SECT. 111L
openly the f~ile and authority of lawv-givers; and
before the beginning of the fifteenth century ,
the complete legifiative power was vest~ed in
them ( QQ).

HAVING fCecured this important acquisition, the and the

feeps~which led to the right of imposing taxes were eo ~of
rendered few and eafyT. The people, accustomed to taxes.
fee their sovereigns-, by their fCole authority, issue
ordinances which regulatedl points of the greatest;
consequence with refpedf to the property of their
fa~bj eas, were not alarmed wihen they were required,
by the royal ediats, to contribute certain fulms to-

Charles VII. and Louis XI. first ventur.ed to exer-

of the people of Fr·ance for gais innovation, that it
excited no commotion in the Kingdom, and seems

complaint.

dom, which, under the firRt race of Kings, was
nearly democratical, which, under the fEecond race,
became an arii~ocracy,- terminated, , under the third
race, in a pure monarchy. Every thing that tended
to preserve the appearance, or revive the memory
of the ancienst mixed g-overnment, seems from that
period~ to have been induffrioufly~avoided. During;
the long and adtive reign of Francis I. the variety
aLs well as extent of whose operations obli~ged him
to lay many- heav~y impositions on his f~ubjeats, the
States-General of France were not once ass~embled,
nor were the people once allowed to exert the
power of taxing themselves, which, according tol
the original ideas of feudal government, Was a righeg

th.e nobility, must be considered as one barrier
agrainft the absolute dfominion of the crown.
Tihough the nobles of France had 10ft that poli·
tical power whick was vested in their order as a
body, they fuill retained the personal rights and
pre-eminence which they derived from their rank.
Tlhey -preserved a, consciousness of elevation above
other classes of citizens; an exemption from bur·
dens to which they were abj~eat; a contempe of
the occupations in whaich ~they were engaged; the

invilege of alliming enlig~ns di'at indicated their SaFfsT In
dignity ; a right to be treated with a certain degree
of deference during .peace;3 and a claim to various
diftinations when in the fieldi. M2any of these ]pre-
tenflons were not founde~d on thbe words of ftatuites,.
or derived from politive laws; they were defined
and ascertained by .the maxims of honour, a title
more delicate, but no less sacred. There rights,
eflablifhed and pJrotededi by a principle equally vi-
gilant in guardiag, and intrepid in defending them,
are to the Sovereign himself objeAs of ref~pec? and
vener~ationr. W~herever they fland in its way, the
royal prerogative is bounded. The violence off a.
Despot may -exterminate such an order of men;
but as long as it fablifts, and its ideas of personal
dillination remain entire, the power of the Prince
has limits ".

As in France, the body of nobility was very nu-
.merous, and the individuals of which it was comp
pos~ed retained an high~fenfe of their own pre-emi-
nence, to this we may akribe, in a, great measure,
the mode of exercising the royal prerogative which
pecul'iarly difting-ilh~kes the gove~n~ment of that
kingdom. An intermediate order was placed be-
tween the Moanarch and his other fubjeats, and in.
every act of authority it became necessary to attend;
to its privileges, and not only to guar~d against any
rea~l violation of t~her~e, but to avoid anly fufjpicion
of its being possible that they might be violated.

France, unknowyn in the ancient world, that~ of a

though unconfined by any legal or constitutional
restraint, has certain bounds s~et to it by the ideas
which one class of his fubjea~s entertain concerning
their own dignity,

nac by the THE jurifdi~tion of the Parliaments in France,
ju"'caision particularly that of Paris, was the other barrier
of the par-
liaments which served to con~fine the exercise of the royd
paraicularly prerogative within certain limits. Tl~he parliament

a ~off Paris was originally the court: of the Kings of

France, to which u they committed the supreme ad.
miniffration of juffice within their own domains;
as well as the power of deciding with refrped to all
caf~es brought before it by appeals from the courts
of the barons.· * hren, in cons~equence of events

when not only the form of its procedure, but the
principles on which it decided, were rendered re·

ance was finally determined there, and when the
people became accuffomed to resort thither as to
the supreme temple of juffice, thne parliament of
Paris rosIe to high effimatios in the kingdom, its
members acquired dignity, and its decrees were
~submitted. to wiith1 deference. Nor was this the
only s~ource of the power and influence. which the
parliament obtained. TPhe Kings of Firance, when
they' first began to affiiine the legislative power, in

order to reconcile the minds of their people to this SECT. I ,
new exertion of prerogative, produced their edicts
and lordinances in the parliament of Paris, that they
might be approved of and regist~ered there, before
they were publihed and declared to be of autho-
nitymn the'kingdomn. During the intervals between
the meetings of the States-General of the kingdom,
or under those reigns when the States-General were
not ass~embled , the monarchs of France were ac-
cuftomed to consult the parliament of Paris with
respect to the most arduous affairs of government,
and frequently regulated their conduc2 by its adl
vice, in declaring war, in concluding peace, and in
other tranBaaions of publick concern. Thus there
was ercfededin the kingdom a tribunal which be-
came the great depository of the laws, and by the
uniform tenour of its decrees, it established princi-
ples of justice and forms of proceeding which were:
considered -as so sacred, that even the sovereign
power of the Mlonarch dudi not venture to difre-
gard or to vialate them. The members of this
illuffrious body, though they neither poffers leg~is-
lative authority, nor can be considered as the re-
pref~entatives of the people, have availed them-
selves of, the reputation and influence which they
had acquired among their countryrnen, in order to
inake a stand to the utmost of their abiitey against
every 'unprecedented and exorbitant exertion of the
prerogative. In every period of the French hif~i-

His presumption and violence were accompanied

obs~erved that the Princes and nobles of Germany,

foch new privileges and jurifdiation wvere ~afirmed,

taxes, coined money, declared war, conclud~ed

tical union which had formed the various provinces
of Germany into one body were entirely 10ft; and

the hiflory, was of a sp~ecies so peculiar, as not to of ibvereil
resemble perfeatly anly form of government known itates·
either in the ancient or modern worl~d. It was a
complex body, formed by the association of s~everal
States, each bs which poffreffed sovereign and in-
dependent jurifdiation within its own territories.
Of all the members which composed this united
body, the Emperor was the head. In his name,
all degrees and regulations with refped to points
of commo~n concern, were ifirued, and- to him the
power of carryirig them into execution wYas coPm-
m~itted. But: this appearance of monarchical power
in the Emperor was more th~an counterbalanced
by the influence of the Princes and States of the
Empire in every adt of adminific~ation. N~o laws
extending to the whole body could pas~s, no re-
solution that afffed5ed the general interest could: be-
taken, without the approbation of the D4iet oF the-
Empire. In this ass~embly, every sovereign Prince;
and State of the Germanick body had a right to bea
present, to deliberate, and to vote. The ·decrees.

ture of this pire appears a regular congfederacy, similar to the
aifrciation. Achaean league in ancient Greece , or to that of

the United Provinces and of the Swiss Cantons in
3modern times. But if: viewed in another light,
firiking peculiarities in its political state jprefeat
themfrelves. The Germanick body was niot formed
by the union of memboers altogether diftinat anda
independent. tAll the princes and States joined in
th~is association, were originally f~ubjeA to the Em-
perors, and acknowledged themn as fCovereigns.
B efides this, they originally held their lands as
Imperial fiefs, and in consequence of this tenure
owed the Emperrors all those services which feudal
vassals are bound to perform to their liege lord.
And though this political fubjeAion was entirely
a~t an end, and the influence of the feudal relation
much ·diminished., the ancient forms and inft~itu-
tions introduced while the Emperors governed
Gerlmany with authority, not inferior to that which
ihe other monarchs of Europe poffeffed, still re-
Imained. T~hus an opposition was established be-
tween the genius .of the government, and the
forms of adminiffration in the German Empire.
The former considered the Emperor only as the
·head of a confederacy, the members of which,
by their voluntar~y choice, have raised him to that:
dignity, the latter seemed to imply, that he is

which on a few occaflons they obtained , wer

and preten- perors, dazzled with the fCplendour of their titkts,

to imagine themselves to be the real sovereigns of
Germany, and were led to aim continually at re·
covering the exercise of those powers which thle
iforms- of the constitution s~eemed to velt in them,
and which their- predecessors, Charlemnagne and
the Othos, had adually enjoyred. The Princes
and States, aware of the nature as well as extedt
of their pretenflons, were ·Iperpetually on their
guard , in order to watch all the motions of the
Imperial~ court , and to circumnfcribe its power
wit~hin limits still more narrow. The Eimperors,
in~fupport of their claims, appealed to ancient forms
and infitiiutions, which- the States held to be obio·
lete. The States founded their rights on recent
-pradtice and modern privileges, wl~ich the Empe·
;zors considered as uforpations.

ther with the oppofitilon between it and the ri~ght~s From the
of the States, inlcreated considerably from the timemannfe'hera
that the Emperors were eleded, not by the col- were exe~ae
leCdive body of German nobles, but by a few Princes
~f chief dignity. During a long period, all the
members of the Germanick body assembled, and
made choice of the person whom they appointed to
be their head. But amidst the violence and anar-
chy which prevailed for several centuries in the
Emp~ire, seven Pri~nces who poff~effed the most exr-
tensive territories, and wyho had olbtained a here-
ditary title to the great offices of the State, acquired
th~e exclusive privilege of nominating the Emperor. a·
This right was confirmed to them by the Golden
Bull a the mode of exercising it was ascertained,.
and they were diignified with the appellation of
~Ele~iors. The nobility and free cities being thus
'firipped of a privilege which they had once enjoyed,
were less conneaed with a Prince, towards whose
elevation they had not contributed by their sus-
fragses, -and came to be more apprehensive of his
authority. The Eledors, by their extensive power,
and the distinguishing privileges which they posT-
felled became formidable to the Emperors, with
wLhom they were placed almost on a level in feve'ral
a(5s of jurifdi~ion. Thus the introduAion of the
Eled~oral college into the Empire., and the autho-
rpity which it acquired, instead of diminishing, con-
tributed to firengthen the principles of hofiity apd
di~cord in the G~ermanick constitution.

SBcT. IIL T HESE Were further augmente~d by the various
rrom tire 3nd repagnant forms of civil policy in the several
different States which composed the Germanick body. It
forms of is~ no easy matter to render the union of independent
f~refblsedn StateS perfeat and entire, even when the genius ands:
in the states forms of their refpedtive governments happen tol
pose th be altogether similar. But in the German Empire,
Germanick which was a confederacy of Princes, of Eccleft.
body. afticks, and of free-cities, it was impossible that

they could incorporate thoroughly. The free.
cities were small republicks, in.whlich the maxims
and sp~irit peculiar to that species of government:
prevailed. The Princes and nobles, to whom fu-
preme jurifdiation belonged, poffeffed a fort of mO.
narchical power within their own territories, andthe
. orms of their interior adminiffration nearly re·
fembled those of thbegreat feudal kingdoms. The
.interests,- the ideas , the objeats of States so differ.
ently constituted, cannot be the fame. Ntor could
tsheir common deliberations be carried on with the
fame spirit, while. the love of liberty and attention
to commerce were the reigning principles in the
cities; while the desire of po'wer, and ardour fo~r
military glory, were the governing pations of the
Pirinces and nobility.

From the THIE frecular and eccleftiafical members of th~e
oppoftioen th. ~~ipkEmpire were as little fitted for union as the fr-ee-
recular and cities and~ the nobility. Vast territories had been
eceiesnaical granted to several of the German bifh~opricks and

membrs.abbeys, and so~me of the highest offices in the Em-

pire havings been annexedl to` them inatlienably, were;

held by the ecclefiaffickrs raised to these dignities. SECT. 111.
The younger s~ons of noblemen of the fecon'd order,
who had devoted themnfelves to the church, were
commonly promoted to there Rtations of eminence
and power; and it was no small mortification to the
Plrinces and great nobility, to fee persons raised
fromn an inferior rank to the ~fame level with them-
selves, or even exalted to su~perior dignity. The.
education of these churchmen, the genius of their
profefion, and their connedtion with the court of
Rome, rendered their charadfer as well as int~erest:
different frorm thofie of the other memnbers of the
G~ermanick body, with whom they were called to
at 'in concert. Thus another source of jealousy
and variance was opened, which ought not to be
overlooked when we are searching into the nature
of the G-ermxan constitution.

To all there causes of diffenflon mayr be added From th~e

the other mrembers, though they enjoyed all the
rights of fovereignry , ruled over fach petty do.
mains,, that their real power bore no proportion to
this high prerogative. A well-compadted and vi-
gorous confederacy could not be formed of such
diflimilar Rtates. The weaker were jealous, timid,
and, unable either to aff~ect or to defend their julk

SurF. III. privileges. The niore powerful were apt to afinne

and to become opprefflive. The elec'tors and Erni
perors by turas endeavoured to extend their own
authority, by encroaching on the rights of those
feeble memberfof the Germa~nick body; and they,
over-awed or corrupted , tamely s~urrendered their
privileges,. or meanly favoured. the dEpfigns formed
against them ( TT).

An aeAPnER contemplating all there' principles of dit

Germanick unionl and opposition in the constitution of the Gers
pbs~eo" inca- man Empire) it will be easy to account for di'e
ing with want of concord and uniformity, conspicuous in its
".nion ana coundils and proceedings. That flow, dilatory, dif

trulitful, and irresolute s~pirit, which charaderizes
all its deliberations, ivill appear natural in a body,
the jundtion of whose members was so incomplete,
the different parts of which were held together by
such feeble ties, and set at variance by such powei·
ful motives. But the Empire of Germany, never.
thelef~s, comprehended countries of fach vast ex·
tent, and was inhabited by fach a martial and hardy
race of men, that when the abilities of an. Empei
ror , or' zeal for any common cause could roule
this unwieldy body to put forth its firength, it
ad~ed wvith irreliftible force. In the fcillowing his·
tory we shall find, that as the meafuLres on which

over the Princes of the Empire , and by engaging

ao make some of the greatest efforts which diftin-

THE Tkurkifh hiltory is to b'lendled, during the view or the

often, and wTith s~uch dlecifive influence in the wars
and negociations of the Chriltian Princes, that some
pretious account of the state of gov~ernment in
that great Empire, is no less necessary for the in-
formation of my readers, than those views of the
conflitution of other kingdoms which IL have azl-
ready exhibited to th~em.

IT has been the fate of the s~outhern andc more its ozrigins.
fertile parts of Asia, at different periods, to be con-
quered by that warlike and hardy race of men, who
inhabit the vast country known to the ancients by
the niame of Scythia, and among: the mroderus by
that ofrrartary. OBne tribe ofthefe people: called
T$urks or T~urcomans, extended its conquests, un-
der various leaders, and during several centuries,
from the fhore' of the C~arpia~n to the Streights of the
Dardanelles. Towairds the middl~e of the fif'teentha
century, these formidable conquerors took Conftan-,

ei i-POtiC BUr though the feat of the Turkish government

was fixed in Eu~rope, and the Sultans obtained pob
fetiron of s~uch exrtenfive dominions in that quarter
of the globe, the genius of their policy was purely
Afiatick , and may be properly termed a defpo.
-tifm, in contradiftination to those monarchical and
republican forms of government which we have
been hithert~o contemplating. The supreme power
wvas vefied in. Sultans of the Ottoman race, that
blood being deemed so sacred, that no other was
thought worthy of the throne. 1From this ele~va.
tion, .these sovereigns could. look down and behold
all their fubjets' reduced to the fame level befoite
them. The maxims of Turkish policy admit not any
of thofie inflitutions, which, in other countries, limit
the exercise, or moderate the rigour of monarchical
power: no great court with constitutional and per-
rnanent jurifdiAion to in~terpose both in enading
laws, and in executing them: no body of hereditary
nobles, whofte sens~e of their own pre-eminence,
wihofe confcioufinef~s of what is due to their rank
sand charader , whose jealousy of their privileges
circumscribe the authority of the Prince, and- serve
nost only as a barrier against the excess~es of his ca-
price, but st~and as anl intermediate order between
him and the people.. Under the T~urkish~ govern-
Inent, the political condition of every fubjea is
equal. To be employed in the service of the Sul·
tan, is the· only circumstance that confers diftinc-

tion; Even this diftindtion is annexed to lofely- SEcill
to the flations in which persons serve, that, it is
fearcely communicated to those who are placed hir
them. TFhe highest dig~nity ·in the ]Empire does;
~not give any rank or pre eminence to the familyr
of him who enjoys it. As every moan , before he
-is ra'ifd to any Rtation of authority , muff go throughi
the pieparatory discipline of a long and servi~le obe~
dience "9, the moment, he is deprived -of power , he
and his posterity return to the fame condition with
other f~ubjeats, and fink back into obs~curity. It is
the difiinguifhing and odious charaderiflick of
Eastern despotism, that it· annihilates all other ranks
of men , in order ·to exalt the monarch, that it
leaves nothing to the former, while it gives every~
thing; to the latter ; that it endeavours to fix
in the minds of thos~e who are fubijeat to it, the
idea of no relation between men, but that: of a
master and of a flavei the former destined to com-
mand and to punish~, the latter formed to tremble
and to obey (UU).

furnish; he appropriated a certain proportion of the
lands in every province for their maintenance; he
regulated, with a minute accuracy , every thing re-

fierce conquxeror admitted the Roman ambassadors
was ended, two Scythians advanced towards At-

his vialories, and -military 'virtues. All the Huns
fixed their eyes with attention on the bardis.

A REMARK ABLE confirmation of both parts of

this reasoning occurs in the hifftory of E~ngla'nd.
T~he Saxons carried on the conquest of that country
with the fame deftrud5tive spirit, which d~iftin-
gu~ihed the pther barbarous nations. T4he ancierik
inh~abitants of Britain were either exterminated;
or forced to take shelter among the mountains'of
W8jales; or reduced into servitude. T~he Sfaxion
government, laws, manners, and language were of
con~sequence introduced into Britairn; and were tol
per~fealy eftaiblilhed, that all meniory of the in.

' ~ftitutions previous to their conqueR was abolished.

'The- very reverse of this happened in aifub~fequiand
revolution. .A ofin gle viao~rsy placed Wlilliam the
NSorman on the throne of England. TSIhe Saxon
inhabitants, ' though o~ppressed, were not exter-
rninat'ed. W~illiam employed the utmo~st efforts
of his powYer and policy to make his new fubjeats
conform in every thing to the Norman flandard;
but: wi~thout f~uceefs. The Saxons, tho~ugh van-
quifhed , were far more nurmerous than their con-
querors; when the two races began to incorpoxrate,
the Saxon lawrs .and manners gradua~lly gained
grourkd. The Norman inf~litutions were unpopu

,,·ar and odious.; many of them fall into d~isuse; and

\ : in the English constitution and language, at this

day, many essential parts are manifestly of Saxon,
riot of Norman extr~a&.

PaocorrUS, the hikorian, declines, from a prin-

of the cruelties of the G,0ths; " Left, says he, I

But as the change, which I have pointed out as a
con~sequence of the settlement of the barbarous
nations in the coi~ntries formerly fubjeA to the
Roman Empire, could not have taken place, 'if
the greater part of the ancient inhabitants had not
been extirpated, an event of fach importance and
influence merits a more particular illuffrration.
This will justify me for exhibiting some part of:
that melancholy fpedacle, over which humanity
prompted P~rocopius to draw a veil. I thall not
however , disgust my readers by a long detail;
but reft satisfied with colleating some instances of
the devastat~ions made by two of the many nations,
which fettled in the Empire. T1he Vandals were
the first of the barbarianis who invaded Spain. It;
was one of the richest and mnoft populous of the
Roman provinces;· the inhabitants had been diftin-
guifhed for courage, and had defended their liberty
against the arms of Raome, with greater obst-inacy,
and durinig a longer course of years, than anyr
nation in Europe. But so entirely were they ener-
vated by their fulbjeaion to the Romans, that the
Vandals, who entered the kingdom ~A. D. 4a09.
·completed the confluedt of it with fach rap~idity,

that in the year 41,lX these barbarians divided it
among; them by caiting lots. The desolation oc.
cationed by their invasion is th~us described by
Idatius an eye-witnef's.' " The barbarians .wasted
every thing with hostile cruelty. ~The pestilence
was no les~s deffrudive. A dreadful famine raged,
to such a degree, that the living weree confiraiied
to feed on the deade bodies of their fellow~-citizens;
and all those terrible plagues des~olated at: once the
unhappy kingdoms. " Idatii Chron. ap.\ Bibli~oth.
Patrum. vol. vii. p. I233. edit. Lugdl 1·677. The
Gfoths having attacked the Vandals in their new
settlements, a fierce war ensued; tlhe counltry wvas
plundered by both parties, the ci~ties which ef~cape'
at first, wyere laid in ashes, and the inhabitants ex·
posed to fuffer every thing th at the wanton cruelty
of barbarians could infliat. Idatius deferibes

Chron. ap. Grot. hist. G oth. 732. From Spain
the Vandals pass~ed over to Afric~a, A. D. 428.
Africa was, next to Egypt, the most fertile of the
Roman provinces. It was one of the granaries
of the Eimpire, and is called by an ancient: w~riter,
the foul of the comnmonwealth. Thbough the army
with which the· Vandals iinvaded it, did noat ex-
ceed 30,000' fighting m~en, they became absolute

/ mnafters of the province in les~s than two ·years. A

contemporary author gives a dreadfull account of
the havock which they made :" They found a
provinee well cultivated, and enjoying~plenty,· the

beauty of the whole earth. They carried their
delirudive arms into every corner of it; they dif-.
peopled it by their devaffations; exterminating
every thing with fire and sword. They did not
even spare the vsines, and fruit trees, that thofCe,
to wThorn caves and inaccefi~ble mountains had
afforded a retreat, m~ight: find no nour~ithment of
any kind. Tlheir hostile rage could not be sati-
ated, and there was no place exempted from the
effeats of it. They tortured their prisoners with
the most exquisite cruelty, that they might force
from them a dis~covery of their hidden treafuwres.
TIhe more they dis~covered, the more they ex-
peteded, and the more implacable they .became.
Neither the infirmities of age nor of s~ex; neither
the dignity of nobility, nor the fanatity of the
faderdotal off-ice, could mitigate their fury; but
the more ·illuffrious their prisoners were, the more
barbarously they jinfulted them. The publicki
buildings w~hich resifted the violence of the flames,
they levelled with the ground. They left many
cities wvithout an inhabitant. W~~h~en they ap-
proached any fortified place, which their undif:
ciplined army could not reduce, they gather~ed
toge~ther a multitude of prifiouers, and putting them
to the fw-rord, left their, bodies unburied, that the
fiench of the earcaffew might oblige the g-arrison
to abandon it." Vidtor Vritenfis de perfecutione

fayfs he ,was -so entirely difpeopled , that on~e

·in· the course of the war five niillions of persons
perished. " Proc~hift. Arcana,. cap. I8. ap. Byz.
Script. vol. i. 3r5. -- I have dwelt; longer upon
the calamities of this province, because they afre
deferibed not only by contempora~ry authors, brit
by eye - witnesses. The present slate of Africa con·
firms their teftimoany. IVaany of the most flourifb·
ing and populous cities with which it was filled,
were so entirely ruined , that no vestig~es remain
to point out where they were situated That ser·
tile territory which fufitained the Roman Empire
l~ies in a great measu~re uncultivated ; and that
province, wvhich Vidior in his barbarous Latin
called Speciofitas totiuLs terrae florentis , is now the re
-treat of pirates and banditti.

WVHILE the Vandals laid waste one part of the.

Empire, the Huns desolated the reft of it. Of all
the barbarous tribes they were the fierceRt and
moss formidable. Ammianus Mar~cellinus ,a con·
temporary author, and one of the best of the later
hifforians ,gives an account of their poliicy and
manners. They nearly resemble those~ of the Scy·
thians deferibed by the ancients, and of the Tartars

knowri

ktnown to the moderns. In fCome parts of their
charadter, and in several of their cuffoms', they
resemble the savages in North America. Thneir
patiron for wyar· and adion was extreme. C( As ine
polished societies (says Ammianus) ease and trazn-
quillity are courted, they delight in war and dan4
gers. He who falls in battle is reckoned happy.
They who die of old age or of dis~eas~e are deemed.
infamous. They boast, with the utmost ex'ulta-
tion, of the number of enemies whom they have
slain, and as the most glorious of all ornaments,
they fasten the fecalps of those who have fallen by
their ·hand to the trappings of their horses. ( Am-

though no fir'angers, by that time, to the ef~feats
of barbarous rage, were afftonifhed at the crueltyr
of their devast~ations. T~hrace , Pannonia , and
Illyricum, were the countries which they sirs1 laid
desolate. As they had no thoughts of fettling in
Europe, their inroads were frequent, and Proco-

wvith the, bones of those who had fallen by the
sword. Prifcus, ap. Byz. Script. vol. i. 34. Attila
became King of the Huns, A. D. 434.: He -s
one of the greatest and most enterprizing con.
qilxerors- mentioned in hist~ory. He extended, his
Empire over all the vast countries, comprehended
und~er the general names of Scyth~ia and Germany
in the axicien t division of the w orld. W7hile he
was carrying on his wars against the bar'barous
nations he kept the Roman Empire ;ander per.
petual apprehenflons, and ·extorted vast fubfiidies
from the timid and effeminate monarchs who gol
vierned it. In the year 45n, he enter-ed Gaul, at
,the head of an army compos~ed of all the various
na~tions wh~lich he had fCubduedB. It was mo/re nu~
merous than any w~ith which ,the barbarians had;
hitherto invatded the Empire. The devaffations
which he committed were horrible; not only ·the
open country, but the most flourish~ing cities were
desolated. The extent and cruelty of his devaffar:
tions are described by Salvianus de Gubernat. Dei,
edit. Baluz. Pbar. 1669. p. I39, &c. and by Idatius
ubi supra, p. n236. A'etius put a flop to his pro:
grefs in ~that country by the famous battle of
Chalons, in which (if we may believe the hifto-
rians of that age) three hundred thousands persons
perished. Idat. ibid. Jornandes de irelaus Geticis

next year he resolved to attack the center of the
Empire, and marching into Italy, wasted it with
rage, inflam~ed by the fedef of his late disgrace.
What Italy fuffe~red by the H~un· excseeded all the

calamities which the preceding incurflons of the
barbarians had brought upon it. Conringius has
collededl feiveral pass~ages from the ajncient hiffo-
rians, which prove that the de~vaff ations committed
by the Vandals ad~d Huns in the countries fxtuati
e~d on the banks of the Rhine, were no less cruel
and fatal to the human race, Exercitatio de
ur~bibus G~ermanize, Opera, vol. i. 488. IBut it
is- endles~s, it is s~hocking to ~folloP rthere dei
ftroylers of mankind through so manyi scenes of
hiorr~or, and to contemxplate the havock which they
made of the human species.

But the itate in which Italy appears to htave

b~een , during jfeveral ages , after the barlbarous
nations fettled in it, is the most decisive proof of
the cruelty as wvell as extent of their devaffations.
Wthenever anly country is thanly inhabited, treeo
a~nd ithrubs spring ul in the uncultivatedl fields,
and spreading by degrees form large forests; by
the overflow-ing of rivlers, and the flagnatinzg~of
waters, other parts of it are converted' into lakes
a~nd rnarfhes. Ancien~t Italyi, the feat of the Ro.
mian elegance and luxury, was cultivated to ther
highest pitch. But so effed~uallyi did the devafta-
tions of the barbarians destroy all the effees of
their indifi~tiy and cultivation, that in the eighth
ceentury~ haly appears to have been covered with
fEorefts and mad~hes o~f vast exrtent. JV~uratori
e3;ngers into a long detail concerning the situation
and limits of thefie; and proves by the moit au-
thentick eviderice , that great traAs of territory,
in all the different provinces ofltaly, wyere ei~rther

ove~r-run wi~th wood , cr· l~aid under water. Nor
did there occupy parts of the ·country naturally
barren or of little value, but were fjpread over
d~iltrics, which ancient writers repres~ent as ex-.
tremely fertile, and which. at prefeat are highly~
cid-ltivated. Murator-i Antiquitates Italic~e red~i

·centuries, Italy was greaetlyT infested by wolves and
other wild beasts; another rnark of i~ts being deft~i-
tute of inhabitants. M~urat. Ahntiq., vol. ii, p. 163.
T'hus Italy, the pride of the ancient world for its
fertility and cultivation, was redu~ced to the slate of
a country newly peopled, and rendered habitable.

I nAM sensible, not only that: some of these deferip-

tions of the devaffations which I have quoted, mpy
be exaggerated, but that the barbarous tribes, in
making their fettlengents , did not proceed inva-
riably in the fame manner. Some of them fetemed·
to be bent: on exterminating the ancient inhlabitants;.
others were more di~sposed to incorporate wi th them.
It is not my province either to enquire inito the·
causes which occasioned this variety in the conduat
of the conquerors, or to describe the slate of those
.countries wyhere thfe ancient: inhabitants were treat-
ed most mildly. TFhe faats which I have produced
are fi~fficient to prove that the deli~rudion of the
human sp~ecies, occasioned by the hoffile invaflons
of the north~ern~ nations, and*E the~ir subsequent s~et-
tlements, was much greater than many authors fceem
to imagine .

I HAVE observed, N-ote II. that ·our only certain

information concerning the ancient flrate of the
barbarous nations must be derived from the Greek
and Roman writers. Happhily an account of thle
inflitutions and cultoms of one peopl2e, to w7hich1

·those of all the reft seem to have been in a great
meas~ure limilar, has been tranfiinitted to' us by
two authors, the most capable perhaps, that ever
wrote, of observing them wYith profoulnd difCcera.
ment, and of deferibing them with· prppriety and
force. The reader must perceive th~at I have C~EfaE
and' T~acitus ha my eye. T-he former gives a short
account of the ancient Germans in a few chapters
of the s~ixth book o~f his commentaries : aThe latter
wrote a treatise expressly on that fubjeA. These
are the mroft precious and infirudtive monuments
of antiquity to the present inhabtitan~ts of Europe.
Fromra themx we learn.

I. Tr~rN the itate of Society among the ancient

Germans w~as of the rudest and most simple form.
THhey bfubifted entirely by- hunting or by paffu-
rage. Czef. lib: vi. c. 21. They negleated agri.
culture, and lived chiefly on milk, cheese, and
flesh. Ibid. ~c. 22. Tacitus agrees with him in
rnoft of these points;; De morib. Germ. c. 14- 15.
23. The Goths were eqjually neg~ligent of agri·
culture. Prise. Rhet, ap. Byz. Script.- v. i. p,. 31.
B. Society was in the f~ame state among the Huns,
who difdained to cultivate the earth, or to touch
a~ plough. Amm, Mlarcel. lib. xxxi. p.' 475 The
~fame manners to-ok place among the Alans; ibid.
p.· 4T77. WMhle ·society remains in this~ simple
12ate, men by uniting together fearcely relinquitt
anly ·portion of their natural independence. As
cordingly we are informed, 21 That the aulthorit)
of cavdl government was extremrely limited amongE

the Germans. During times of peace they had
-ne common~ or fixed mag~iffrate , but the chief men
ol every difStrial difpernfed juffice, and acco~mmo-
dated dififerences. Caef. ibid. c. 23. Their Kings
~had not absolute or unibounded power; their au-
thorityaconfifted rather in the priv~ilege of advising,
than in the power of commanding. Matters of
"Small consequence were determined by the chief
men; affairs of importance Iby the whole com-
munity. Tacit. c. 7. Ir. The H~uns , in like
manner, deliberated in common concerning every
ibufinefs of moment to the society; and were not
fubjeat to the rigour of regal authority. Ahmm.
1Vlarcel. Jib. xxxi. Ip. 474. 3. .Every individual
among the ancient Germains was left at liberty to
chufe whether he would take part in any mili'tary
enterprize which was proposed; there s~eems to
have been no obligation to engage in it impos~ed
, on him by publick authority. " Wrhen any- of
the chief men proposes anly expedition, fach as
approve of the cause and of the leader rife up, and
declare their intention of following him; those
who do not fulfil this engagement, are considered
as defrerters and traitors, ~nd are looked upon as
infamous. c Caeef ibid. c. 23. Tacitus Ijrainly
points at the fame cuffom, though in terms m'ore
obfcare. Tacit. c. Ir. 4. As every individual
was so independent, and master in fCo great a de-
gree of his own ad~ians, it became, of consequence,
the great objeat of every pers~on among the Ger-
mans who aimed at being; a l~eader, to gain adhe-
rents, and attach them to his person and interest.

R4L

These adherents Caf~ar calls Amzbani and ClientEes
i. e. retainers or clients; T~acitus, Comites or com-~
patnions. T~he chief diftination and, power of the
leaders, consisted in being attended by a numerous
band of chosen youth. This was their pride as
wvell as ornament during peace, ·and their defence
in war. The leaders gained or preserved the
favour of these retainers by presents of armour·,
and of hors~es; or b0y the profufie, though inele-
gant ho'p~itality, Yit~h which they entertained them.
Tacit. c. r4, I5-. 5. Another confe'quence ~of the
personal liberty and independence which the Ger-~
smans retained, even after they united in society,
w~as their circumscribing the criminal jurifdiation
of the magjfirate within very narrow limits, and
their not only claiming but exe~rcising almof2 all the
rights of private resentment and revenge. Their
magistrates had not the power either of impriso~n-
ing, or of infliding any corporal punishment: on a
1free man. Tacit. c. 7. Every person was obliged
to avenge the wrongs which his parents or friends
had sustained. Their enmities were hereditary,
but not irreconcilable. Even murder was com-
penfated by paying a certain number of captle.
T~ac. c. 2T. A part of the ftine went to the K~ing,
or Rate, a part to the person who had been injured,
or to his'. kindred. Ibid. c. I2.

THrO SE particulars concerning the inflitutions

and manners ~of tlie G~ermans, thougoh well known
to every person conversant in ancient literature, I
hiave thought proper ~to arrange in this order and.

to lay before such of my readers as may be less
acquainted with these fa~ts, both~ because they con-
firm the account which I have given of the state
of the barbarous nations, and because they tend
to illuffrate all the observations I shall have oc-
cation to make concerning the various changes in
their government and cuffoms. The laws and
cuffomns introd~uced by the barbarous nations into
their new settlements, are the best commentary on
the writings of C~aesar and Tacitus, and their ob.
fervations are the best key to a per~se61 knowledge
of these laws and cuff~oms.

ONE circumff ance with refpedl to the tess imonies

of Caesar and Tacitus concerning the Germans,
mierits attention. Caesar wrote his brief account of
their manners more than an hundred years before
Tacitus composed his treatise De moribus Germna-
nor'um. An hundred years make a confiderabole pe-
riod in the progress of national manners , especially
if, during that time., thos~e people who are rude
and unpvo~lifhed have had much communication
with more civilized slates. T~h~is was the caf~e with
the Germans. Their intercourse with the Romans
began when CaefTar crossed the Rhine, and increa~sed
prodigiously during the interval between that,
event and the time when TFacitus flourished. Be-
sides this, there was a considerable difference be-
tween the sla~te of ;society among the diifferent
tribes of Germans. TShe Stiiones were so much
improved, that they began to be corrupted. T'ac.
c. 44. The Fenni were so barbarous~, that it is

w~bnderful how they were able to fubGRt. bid. cap,
46. Whhoever undertakes to deferibe the manners
of the. Germans, or to found anly political theory
upon the Rtate of society among them, ought care.
fully to attend to both these circumffances.

BEFORE I quit this f~ubjea, it may not: be im·

properesto observe, that though' successive altera·
tions lin, ·their inflitutions, together with th~e gra·
dual p~rogres~s of refinement, have made an entire
change in the manners of the various people who
conqluered the Roman Empire, there is still one
race of omen nearly in the fame political situation
wi-th theirs when they first fettled iln their new con·
quefis:· I- mean the various tribes and nations of
Savages in North America. It cannot then be
considered either as a digress~ion, or as an improper
indulgence of curiosity, to enquire wv~hether this
similarity in their political state has occasioned
any resemblance between their charadrer and
m~~aanners. If the li~keness turns out to be ft~rik-
in~g, it is a fironger ·proof that a juit account
has been given of the ancient; inhabitants of
Europe , than the testimony even of Caesar or
ofE Tacitus.

r. THE Americans sublist chiefly by hunting abd!

fishing. Some tribes negled ~agriculture entirely.
Among those who cultivate some fmnall: spot near
their huts, that, together with all works of labour,
is performed by the women. P. Charlevoix Jour-
nal Hillaori~i~ d'un Voyage de 1'Ap4riqlue 4to.

·Par. 7744. P· 334. In fCuch a Rtate of society, the
common wants of men being few , and their mutual
dependence upon each other Small, their union is
extremely imperfedt and feeble, and th~ey continue
to enioy· their natural liberty almost unimpatired.
It is the firflidea of an American, thitt every man
is born free and independent, and that no power on
earth hath' any right to diminish or- circulmfcribe
his natural liberty. There is hardly anly appear-
Sance of subordination either in civil or domeltic go-
vernment. Every one does what he pleas~es. A f~ather
and ~mother with their children, live like persons
whom chance has brought together, and whom no
coplmon bond unites. Their manner of educating
their children is fa~itable to this principle. They
never chastise or punish them, even during their
infancy. As they advance in years, they al~lowS
them to be entirely masters of their own aAions,
and responsible to nobody. Id. p. 272, 2793.--
2. The power of their civil magiffrates is extremely
limited. Among most of their tribes, the Sachem
or chief is eleaive. A council of old men is chosen
to aff~if him , without whos~e advice he determines
no affair of importance. The Sachems neither pof-
fess nor claim any great degree of authority. They
propose and intreat rather than command. The
obedience of threir people is altogether voluntary,
Id. p. 266. 268.---3. The favatges of America
engage in anly military enterprize, not from con-
firaint, but choice. Wa~hen war is ref'olved, a chief
arises,, and offers himfCelf to be the leader. Such
as are willing (for they compel no person) stand

upI one after another, and sing their war song. But
if after this, any of these thould refuse to fo~llow

STHE booty gained by an anny belonged to the

what he acquired by lot. A remarkable instance
of this occurs in the hiffory of the Franks. T~lhe
a~rmyr of Clovis~, the founder of the French mo.
narchy, having plundered a church, carried off,
a~mong other facired.utenfils, a vase of extraordinary
size and -bea~uty.' Th~-e bishop sent deputies to
Clovis, beseeching him to restore the vase, that it
might ~be again employed in the f'ac~red services to
w ·~hich .it had been .confecra ted. Clovis desired
the deputies to followx him to Soi(Tons, as the
booty was to be divided· in that place, and pro-
mifedF, th~at if the lot thould give him the dis~posal
of the va.se, *he woufld grant what the bifhlop de·
fired. Wh&Ten he came to Soilbons, and all the

THE hiffory of the efliablifh~ment and progreifs
of the feudal system, is an interefing objeat to all
the :nations of Europe. In some countries,. their
jurisprudence and laws are still in a great measure
feudal. In others, many forms and pradices efta-
blifhed by cuffom, or founded on statutes, tooke
their rif~e from the feudal .law, and cannot: be unp
derftood withoilt attending to-the ideas peculiar to:
it. Several authors of the highest reputation for
genius and erudition, have endeavoured to illus-
trate this fuibjeat, but they have left many parts, of
it obscure. I thall endeavour to trace, -with pre-
cifion, the· progress$ and variation of ideas concern-
ing property in land among the barbarous nations;
and [Chall attempt to point out the caufCes whic~h inz-
t~roduced these changes , as well as the efFeaEs which
followed upon th~em. Property in land seems to
have gone through foyrar uccellive changes among
the people who fettled in the various provinces of
the Roman Empire.

I[. WJHILE the barbarous nations remained· in

their original countries , their property in land was
only temporary, and they had no certain limits to·
their poffefirons. After feeding their flockts in one
diffria, they removed with them, their wives and
families, to another; and abaindoned that likewyife.
in a sh~ort; time. Tlhey were not, in consequence of
this imperfed species of property, brough~t under
any politive or formal obligation to serve the com-

munity~; all their services were purely voluntary:
Every individual was at liberty to chufe how far he
wvould contribute towards carrying on any military
enterprize. If: he followed a leader in any .expedi:
tio~n, it was from attachment , not fro~m a s~ens~e
of.obligation. Thke clearest proof· of this ha~s been
produced; in Note VI. WVhile property continued
in this slat~e, we can dis~cover nothing that ·bears any
reflemblance.to a. feudal tenure, or, td: the faubordi
nation and milit~ary fCervice which the feudal fyften
introduced.

II. U6Prow fettling in the countries which they

h~ad subdued , the viAtorious, troops divided the
conquered lands. Wh~atever portion of them fell
to a soldier, he seized as the recompeince due to
his valour , as a settlement acquired by hiis own
fiword. He tooke p~neffefiozi of it: as a freeman in
full property. He enjoyed. it during his oYn. life,
and could dispose· of it ait pleafare·, or transmit it as
an inheritance to his children. Thus property in
land became fixed. It was at the flamep t~iine allo·
dlial, i. e. . the poffeffor had the entire right of
property and dominion; hie held of no sovereign
or fIuperiorr lord, to whom he was boun~d to do
homage, and perform s~ervice. But as these newS
proprietors were in some danger (as has be~en ob-
served in the text. ) of being difttirbed by~ the
rema~idder·-of the ancient inhabitants, and in .Ptill
greater danger of being attacked by fa-cceive
fcolonies of baibarians as fierce and rtapacious as
themfeles,· they saw the necefit~y of cormfug under

obligations

obligations to ,defend the comnrmunitty, more ex-.
plicit than those to which they had ~been f~ubtjea
in their original habitations. On 'this account,
immaediately upon their fixing in their new f~ettle-
maens, every freeman became bound to take arms
in defence of thle community , and if he refufekd
or negledted so to do, was liable to a conflderable'
penalty. I~do not; mean that any contraa~ of this
kind was formally concluded, or mutually ratified
bjy any legal solemnity. It was establish~ed by
tacit: cons~ent, like the other consipaas wlhich hold
society together. T~heir mutual s~ecurity and pre-
fCer vation made it the interest; of all to recog-
nize its au~thority, and to enforce the observation
of it. Wie can traice back this irew obligation one
the proprietors of land, to a veryr early· period ina
the hiffory of the Frank~s. Chi-lperic, wyho began
,his reign A. D. 562, exaded a fine, bannor jus]2t

accompany him in an exped ition. Gregor. T-Juron.

change was introduced, though slowly, and i~ep
by [tep. Wey learn fromn Tkacitus, that the chief
men among the G~ermans endeavoured to attach
to their persons and intereas certain adherents
whorm, he calls Comites. TIhere fought under their
ilandard , and followed them .in all their enter-
,prilzes~. 'Th-e fame cuffom continued among themn
in their newy settlem~ents, and those attached or
devoted followyers wcere called fdeles antruffones,

the Germans remained in their own country they
courted the fa.vour of therfe Comites by pres~ents of
arms and horfeis, and. ·byr hosp~itality. See Naote VI.
Ass long as thley ha~d no fixed property in land,,
these were the only gifts that th-ey could beffocw,
and the only rewvard wlbhich their folllowers delirecl.
But upon their fettling in the countries which they
conquered, and when the value of property came
·to be understood among them, idl~iead of those
flight presents, the Kings and chie~tains bellowed
a more substantial recompence in land on their
adherents. ' herCe grants were called beneificia, be-

`cause they were gratuitous donations;- and honores,
because they were regarded as marks of diftindtion.
What were the s~ervices originally exadted in returnr
f~or these beneficia cannot be determined wyith ab·
solute precii~on; because there are no records so
Bncient.` WThen allod~ial poflfeffions were first Irm.f
dered feudal, they were not, at once, fixbjeated to
all the feudal services. Tlhe tradiition here , as ;in
all other changes o~f importance, was grad~ua2;
A's the great objeat of a feudal valfal was t~e ob-
Stain protedion, when allodial proprietors firlt con-
f~ented' to become vassals of anly powerful leader,
t~hey contim~ied~ to retain as much. of their ancient
'independence as. was cohfiftent w'Lith thait nlew~ rela-
tion. The homage which they didl to the s~uperior
iof whom they chose to hold, was called homagium~r
planum, and bound them to nothing more than
fidelity, but wi~thout any obligatiosn es'ther of niili-
tary s~ervice, or attendance sin the cEjurts of their
superior.. Of t'his homaginni planum some ·traces,
though obscur~e, may filil be discovered. BruffeP·,

seem to be an intermediate flep between the h~o-
mzag7ium planum~ mentioned by' Brurffel, and the
engagement to perform complete feudal service.
T'he one party promis~es procedion, and grants
certain castles or lands, the other eng~ages to defend
the person of the granter, and to aln lift hi ke_
~wife in defenading his property as. often as he fhal

are accompanied with none of the feudal formali-
ties, and no mention is made of any of the other

proofs and reafopings and conjeAures, it seems to
be evident, that a~s every free man, in consequence
of his allodial property, was bound to serve the
community under a severe penalty, no good reafonm
can be assigned for conferring these beneficia, if
they: did not fubje&t such as received them, to

still continued to grant some bene/icia, ordy during
life. De de Diplomatica,' lib. vi. p. 353. . In the
year 8859, Odo King of France granted landsl to
Riicabodo fideli suo jure' beneficiaro & frudulario
during hi~s own life; and if he thould die, and a T'on
wrere~ born to him, that right was to continue du·
ring the life of his son. MVabillon ut; supra, p. 556,
This was an intermediate Rtep bet~ween fiefs merely
:during life, and fiefs h'ereditary to perpetuity.
T7ihile' bene~ccia continued under their first form,
and were held only during pleasure, he who granted
them not only exercised the Dominium or prer'oga-
tive of superior Lord, but he retained the property,
giving his vassal only the fu~!frac7Z. But under the
latter form, w~hen they became hereditary, although
feudal Jawyers continued to define a benefcwuni
agreeably to its original nature, the property ivas
in effedr taken, out of the hands of the fulperior
lord, and lodged in those of the vassal. As soon
at the reciprocal advantages of the feudal mode
of tenure came to be underflood by fTuperiors as
wvell as vassals, that· frpecies of holding became so
agreeable to both, that not only landls,,but cafbual
rents,- fach as the profits of a toll, the fare paid at
ferries , &c. the fralaries or perquisites of offices,
and even penflons themselves, wvere granted and

.rious and cafuxal property as a fief, there are in-~

profits arising fromf the masses said at an altar, were
properly an ecclesia~stical revenue, belonging to the
clergy of the church or monastery which performed
that duty , but these were fornetimes seized by the
j powerful barons. In order to ascertain their right:
to them, they held them as fiefs of the church,
and parcelled them out in the fame manner as other
property to their fab-vaffals. Bouquet, recueil des
hifk. vol. x. 238- 480. The fame spirit of encroach-
ment whi;ch rendered fiefs heredi~tary, led' the
nobles to extort from their sovereigns hereditary

this spirit of usurpation among the nobility, and

caflons, they obliged the -pers~ons whom they pro-
Smoted to anly offfice of dignity, to grant an obliga-
tion that neither they, nor their heirs, Ihould claim
it as belon gin g -to them by hereditary right. ~A
remarkable inflan~ce of this is produced, IVIm. de

property occasioned a change correfponiditg to it
in political government; the great vassals of the
crown, as they acquired such extensive pofi~feions,
usurped a proportional degree of power, depreffedl
the jdrifdidtion of the crown, and trampled on

the privileg~es of the people. It is on acceoune'
of this connedion , that it becomes an o bjeQ of
importance in hiflory to trace the progress o

ONE circumfiance more , with ref~pedt to thle

cihanges w~hich property undierwent , deserves atten;
tion. I have shewn ,that: when the v~arious tribes
of barbariains divided their Iconqueits in the fifth
and sixth centuries, the property which they ac.
quired was allodial; but in s~everal parts of Eu·
rope, property had become almost entirely feudal
by the beginning of the tenth century. The for-
aner fp'ecies of property seems to be so much bet.
t2er and more desirable thanz the latter; that fuchi a
chiange appears surprising, especially when we are
informed that allodial property was frequently
converted into feudal, by a voluntary d~eed of the,
poffeffor. The motives which determined them
-to a 'choice s~o * repugnant to the ideas of modern
times concerning property, have been investigated
and explainedi by M~i. de M~iontefqluieu with his us~ual
discernment and' accuracy, lib. xxxI. c. 8. The
most; considerable is that of which we hiave an hintt
in Lambertus Ardenfis, an anlcient .writer quoted
by DEu Cange, voce Alod~is. In t~hose timnes of anar-.
chy and difbrdier which became general in Europe

after the death of Charlemagne, when there was
rcarcely any union among the different members
of the community, and individuals were exposed,
lingle. and undefended by government, to rapine
and oppression, it became necessary for every man
to have a powerful protecfor, under whose bannelr
be might range hirmf~elf, and obtain security against:
~nemies whom he could not singly oppose. For
this reason he relinquished his allodial indepen-
dence, and fubjeated himself to the feudal services,
that he might find safety under the patronage of
Tome ref~pedable superior. I~n some parts of Eu-
rope, this change from allodial to feudal property
became so general, that he who poffeffed landi had
no longer any liberty of choice left. He was
obliged to recognize some liege lord, and to hold
of him. Thus Beaumanoir informs us, that in
the counties of Clermont and Beauvois, if the Lord
or C~ount dis~covered anly lands within his jurifdic-
tion, for which no service was performed, and
wrhich paid to him no tax or cuffoms, he might
instantly seize it as his own; for, says he, accord-
ing to our custom no man can hold allodial pro-
perty. Coult. ch. 24. p. I23. Ulpon the fame
principle is founded a maxim?, which has at length
become general in the law of. France, N~ulle terre
fans Seigneur. In other provinces of France, allo-·
dial property fieems to have remained longer una-
lienated, and to have been more highly valued. A
vast number of charters, containing grants, or sales,
or exchanges of allodial lands in the province of
Languedoc, are published Hist. giCndr. du Languedo

IN tra~cing these various rev\olu~tions of property,:
Ihave hitherto chiefly confined m~ys~elf to what hap-
pened in France, because the ancient monuments
of that nation have either been more carefully pre-
served, or have been more clearly illuffrated than
those of anly people in Europe.

IN Italy, the fame revolutions happened in pro-
perty, and succeeded each other in the fame order.
There is s~ome ground, however, for conjecturing
that allodial property continued longer in eftima-.
tion among the Italians, than among the French.
It appears, that many of the charters granted by
the Emperors in the ninth century, conveyed an
allodial right to land. Mlurat. antiq. med. aevi,

find some examples of perso~ns ;who reign/ed their
alledial property, and received it back as a feudal

place of benef~cium, does not occur in anly authen~-

THE 'progrefs off the feudal fyfitem among the

G-ermanis was perfealy similar to that which we
have traced in France, But as the Emperors of
G~ermany, especially after the Imperial crown
passed from the defcendaents of. Charlemagne to
the hou~se of Saxoiry, were far su~perior to the
contemporary Mlonarchs of France, in abilities,
the Imperial vassals did not aspire so early to in-
dependence, nor did they so soon obtain the pri-
Vilege of poff~effing their benefices by hereditary

who dwelt .in cities, I will confine myself in, this
to~s confider the st~ate of the inhabit~ants of the

persons the property in whom was acquired, in
some one of the various methods enumerated by

wyretched~ condition of this numerous race of men
·will ap~pear from several circulmffances. I. Their
anafters had absolute dominion over their persons.
They had the power of punish~ing their Slaves ca·
pitally ,without the intervention of any judge.
This dangerous right they poff~effed not only in
the more early .periods, when their manners were
fierce," but it continued as late as the twvelfth
·century. Joach. Potgiefferus de fltatu fervorum.

t~o be reitrained, the life of a slave wyas deemed to

be

be of fCo little valu~e, that a very flight compend·
fation atoned for taking; it away. Idem, lib. iii,
c. 6. If masters had powrer' over the lives of their
slaves·, it is evident that almost no bounds wiould"'
be fetc to the rigo~ur of the puniihments which they
might infiat. upon them. The Codes of ancient:
laws prescribed punilhments for the crimes ofi
slaves different from thos~e which wiere inflidted ona
free· men, The latter paid only a fine or cornn
penfation, the former wyere fubjleded to corporal
punifhmenits. The cruelty of these was in manyt
infatances excefli~ve. Slaves might be put to the
ra~ck on very flight occahions TIhe laws with
refped to these points are to b found in Potgief-
ferus, lib. iii, cap. 7. z. If the dominion of
masters over the lives and persons of their slaves
ttas thois extensive, it was no less so over their
aations and property. They wrere not: originally
permitted to marry. Mbiale and female slaves were
allowed and even encouraged'to cohabit together.
But this union was not considered$ as a marriage,
it w~as called contubernium; not nzuptiae or matri-.
monzium. P'otgieff. lib. ii. c. 2. 5 T. T]Chis notion
·was to much established, that during several cenl-
turies after the, bar~barous nations embraced the
Christian religion, slaves who lived as hufboand and
wife, wrere not joined together by any religious
teremony, and did not receive the nuptial bene-
diation from a priest. Ibid. 5 I0, II. W~Then this
conjundtion between slaves game to.be considered
as a lawful marriage, they were not permitted to

charters which illuffriate this well-known circum--
fltance in the condition of slaves. Lib. ii. c. 4.
5. Slaves had a title to nothing but fub~lifence
and clothes fr~om their rnafter, all -the profits of
their labour accrued to him. If a mnafter, from
indulgence, gave his slaves ·any pjeculiarnm or fixed

moveable at pleasure., or held their farms by lease
for a. certain n~umber of years. The former ,if
we may judge from the genius and maxims of the
age, seems to be most probable. These persons,
however, were considered as free men in tlhe molk;
honourable sen~se of the word; they enjoyed all
the privileges of that condition, and were even
called to. fervpe in war; an honour to which no
slave was admitted. IVIurat. Antiq. vol. i. p. 743.
vol. ii. p. 4·46. This account of the condition of
these three different classes of persons, will enable
the reader to apprehend the-full force of an argo-
ruent which I fhiall produce in confirmation of·
what have s~aid in the text concerning the wretched
state of the people during the middle ages. Not~-
w~ithstanding the immense difference between the
first; of 'thefe classes and the third, fulch was the

[piriit of tyranny~ which prevailed among the great
proprietors of la~nds an~d so various their oppor-
tunities of oppressing those who were fettled on
their estates, and of rendering their condition in,
tolerable, that many fr-ee men, in despair, renounced
their liberty, and voluntarily surrendered them-
selves as slaves to their powerful masters. This
they did, in order that their masters might become
more immediately interested to afford them pro-
teation, together with the means of subsisting
themf'elves and their families. The forms of such
a ~surrender, or obnoxiatio, as it w~as then called,
are preserved by M~arculfus, 1ib. ii. c. 28; and. by
the anonymous author published by M.. Bignon,
together with ·the colleation of for~mule compiled
by M~arculfus, c. 16. In both, the reason given
for the obnoxiatio , is the wretched and indigent
condition of the person who gives up his liberty.
Ift was flillmore common for free men tofiurrender
their liberty to bishops, or abbots that they might
par take of the security which the vassals and slaves,
of churches and monasteries enjoyed , in~ confe-
quence of the su~perstitious veneration paid to the
faint under whose immediate protedtion they were
supposed to be taken. Du Cange, voc. oblatus,

miserable indeed , which could induce a free, manr

Tghe Rom~nans wrote their, books either on parch:~

mnent or on paper made of the Egyptian papyrusi
The la~tter being the cheapest, was· of course the
smoft commonly ofed. But after the Saracens
conquered Eg~ypt in the se~venth century, the com-
munication bsetw~ueen that country and the peopk>
fC1Cettled in Italy or in other parts of E~urope, was
almost entirel~y broken off, ·and .the papy)rus was
no long~er .in use among them. They were ob-
lIged, on tha~t account, to write all their books
upon parchment, and as the price of that was high,
books became extremely rare and of great value.·
We may judge of the fea~rcity of the materials for
writing them from one circumstance. There still
remain several manu~cripts of the eighth, ninth,.
and following centuries, wr~lote on parchment, from
which some former writing had been erased, in
order to furbft~itute a new compefition in its place.
In this manner, it is probable, that fCeveral works
of the ancients perifihed,· A <book of Livy or of
Ta;citus might be erased, to make room for the
legendary tale of a faint, or the Piiperftitious
prayers of a mniffal. IMurat. Antiq. Ital. v. iii.
p. 635. P. de Montfaucon affirms, that the g-reater
part .of the manus~cripts on parchment which he'
has seen, thos~e of an ancient date excepted, are
written on parchment from which some former
treatise had, been era~fedE. ,1VI~m. de l'Acad. d~es

rials for writingj, is one reason why so many of
the works of the ancients have perished, it accounts
likewise for the Imnall number of mandb~ripts of

ny kind, previous to the eleventh century , wohen
h~ey began to mzultiply from a· cause which shall be
nen~tioned. Hist. Liter. de France , tom. vi. p. 6.

4T is no inconfidg~rable misfortune to the church

of R~ome ,whose doatrine of~ infarllibility renders all

sauch inftitrutions 4an ceremoniies as have been once:
universally received , immutable and everlasting,;
that: ihe muft'continue' to obfrerve in enlighten-ed
times, those rites which were introduced during·
the ag~es of dar~kness and credulity. W~hat delighted
and edified the latter , must disgust and th~ock the
former. MIany oFthefe, rites appear manifestly to
have been introduced by a s~uperstition of the lowest
anfd most illiberal species. Mlany of them were
borrowed , with little variation, from the religious
ceremonies eftabliifhed among the ancient Hea·
thens. Some were so ridiculous, that if every age
did not furnish instances .of the fascinating influ-
ence of fu~perltition ,'as well as of the whimsical
forms wihich it assumes , it must appear incredible
that thiey thould ever be received or toleratedi. In
several churches of France, they celebrateda fefti·
val in commeinoration of the V7irgin Mary's flight
into Egypt. It was called the feast of the Afis. A
young girl. richly dr-essed, with a child in her arms,
was set upon an ass s~uperbly caparif~oned. The ass
was led to the altar in solemn pr-ocession. High
Mlafs was said with great pomp. The ass was
taught to kneel at proper places; a hymn no less
childish than impious was s~ung in his praise: ahd
when the ceremony was ended, the priest, instead
of the usual words with which~ ~he difmiffedt the
people, brayed three times like an ass; and the
people , instead of their lifual response , We bles~s
the Lord , brafied three times inithe fame manner.

dlculous ceremony was not, like the feffival of
fools, a~nd some other pageants oss those ages , a
mere farcical entert~ainment exhibited in a church,
zgnd mingled , as vas then the cuffom , with an imi-
tation off'ome religiouLs rites; it wtas an aA of de-
votion, performed by the miniffers of religion, and
by the authority of the church. However , as this
pradtice did not prevail universally in the Catho-
lick church, its absurdity contributed at last to
abolish it;.

As there is noa event in .the hiflory of' mankind
more singular tlhan .that of the Crusades, every
circumstance that tends to explain or to give any
rational account of this extraordinary frenzy of the.
human mind is intereffing. .I have asserted in the
text, that the minds of men were prepared gra-
dually for the amazing. effortw~hichh they made in
consequence of the exhortations of Peter the her-
mit, by leveral occurrences previous to his time.
A more particular detail of this curious and ob-
·fcure part of hiffory , may perhaps appear to some
of my7 readers to be of importan~ce. That the end
of the world was expecdted about the close of the
tenth and begainning of the eleventh century; and
that this occasioned a general alarm , is evident from
the authors to whom I refer in the textt. This be-
lie'f was so 'univerfal and so firong, that it mingled
itself with~ their civil tran~fa~cions. .Mlany charters,
in the latter part of the tenth ceptury , begin ill

this manner: " Appropinquante mundi terminb,'!

3P. de M'dontfaiucon has colle~ted thes~e des~criptions,
and ranged ;them under different heads. T~he
court of tlie mrore early Greek ~Emperors seems to
have resembled th~ose of Eastern monarchs, both
in magnificence and in corruption of manners.

concerning the comparative Rlate of ms'anners in

Const-antinople was the place of rendezvous for

g·ether the: people of the east and weft irs to one
$reatt inlterviewN. There are extant sever~al con-

NOTE XV. SECT. I. p. 38. (P).

THE different fiaeps taken by the cities of Italyp

in order to extend their power and dominions are
remarkable. As soon as their libert~ies were effa-
blifhed, and. they began to feel their owni im-
portance, they endeavoured to render themselv~es
masters of thd territory round their walls. Under.
the Romans, w~hen cities enjoyed municipal pri-.
vileges and. jurifdiAion , the circumjacent lands
bjelonged to each. town, and were the Property of
the comnmunity. But as it was not: the genius of
the feudal policy to encourage cities, or to shew
any ·regard for their poffefrion's and immunities,
the-se lands had been seized, and shared among
the conquerors. T~he barons to whom they .were
~granted,\ erededl their 'caRles almoRe at ithe gates
of the citiy,. and exercised their jurildiation there.
Under, pretence ~of recovering their ancient pro-
perty , many of the cities in Italy at~tacked th~ese
troublesome- neigh'bours , and difp~oiffefng them,
annexed their territories to the communities, anld

made therebjr a considerable addition to t~heir
power. Several inftrances of this .occur in the
eleventh, and beginning of the twelfth centuries.
MVurat. Antiq. Ital. vol. iv. p. I59 , &c. T~heir
ambition increasing together with their power, the
cities aftery rards- att-acked: several barons situated
·at a- greater ·difiance from them,' and oblig~ed there
to engage that they should become members of
~their community; that they should take the oath
of fidelity to their magiffrates; that they should
-flibjea their lands to all burdens and taxes im-
poised by common confCezt; that; they tihould de-
fend the community against: all its enemies; and.
that they- should reside within the city during a
certain specified time i~n each year. IVaurat. ibid.
163. This fubjedion of the nobility to the muni-
cipal government ei-ablifh~ed in cities, became
almost universal, and wIvas often extremely grievous
to pers~ons accustomed to confider thems~elves as
independent. Otto Frifingenfis thus deferibes the
slate of Italy under F~rederick ]I. Cb THhe cities so
much affed liberty, and are s~o solicitous to avoid
the insolence of power, that almost all of them
have 'thrown off every other authority , and are
governed by 'their· own magiffrates. Infomxuch
that all that country: is now filled with free cities,
each of which have compelled their bilhops to
reside within their walls, and there is fecarcely anly
nobleman, how great soever his power may be,
whon is not fuzbjeat to the laws and government

bec;iatme more populous, but were filled wvith is-

-the great towns, than is ufial in other parts of
Europe. As citiies acquired new consideration and
dignity .by the accellfion of such citizens , they
became more solicitous to preserve their liberty
and independence. T1~he Emperors, as sovereigns,
had· anciently a palace in almost every great city
of Italy; when they vilited that country they
wrere accidiomed to reside in thnere, and the troops
which accompanied them were quartered in the:
hous~es of the citizens. Tlihis the citizens d`ceemed
both ignominious and dangerous. T~hey could
not help considering it as receiving a maiter and
an enemy within their walls. They: laboured there-

LONG before the infit~tution of communities inx

France, charters of immunity or Franchise were
granted to s~ome towns and villages by the Lords
on whom they depended. But these are very dif-
ferent from such as became comnmon in the twelfthi
and thirteenth centuries. ~They did not ered' these
towns into corporations; they: did not establish a
muinicipal government; they did riot grant them
the privilege of bearing arms. TIhey contained
nothing more than a manumission of the inhabi-
~tants from the yoka of fCervitude; an exemptiont
from certain services wyhich were opprefirve and
ignom~inious ( and· the establishment of a fixed
tax or rent which they were to pay to their Lord
in place of imljofitions which he could formerly
lay upon them at pleaifure. Two) chart< rs of this

kind- t, two vill-ages in th~e counrty of Roufillon,

·s: probable, were not unknown in other parts of
Europe, ·and may be considered. as a Reip towards
the more extensive· privileges conferred by Louis
the Glrofs on the towns wyithi'n his -dom~ains. Thel
cmmm~nunities in France never aspired to the fame
independence with those in Italy. T~hey acqjuired
new pri~vileges an3 immuainities6 , bt the right of
sovereignty remained entire to the King <sr baron
within whose ~territories the refpedive cities were
situated, and from whom they received the charter
of the-ir freedom. AP great number of these char-
tirs granted both by the Kings of France, and by
their great vassals , -are p~blifhed by D~acher
,In his· Spicilegiumn , ·and many are found in the
colleaion of the Ordonnances des Rois de France.
Tahere convey a very rilriing reprefEentatioan of the
wretched condition of cities previous to the ·inlti-
tution of communities, when they were fabjea to
the judges appointed by the superior. Lords of
wurhom they heldl, and had. scarcely any other law
bout their will. Each concellion in there charters
rdulit be considered as a grant of some new pri-
vilege" which the people did~not formerly enjoyi
and each regulation as a method of redressing foure
grievance under ·which they formerly laboured.
TIhe charters of communities contain likewise the
drirt expedients employed for the introduAion of

eqlual laws , and reguilar· goverrnment. Oh both

great source of their power and authority. But,
by the inflitution of communities , effedual pro-
villon was ma~de for the safety of individuals indei
pendent of the nobles.· For, r. the fundamenital
article in every charter was, that all the members
of -`it bouind thems~elves byr oath to assist~, defend,

that they thould not f~uf-fer any pe"rfon to injur-e,

In society, while it remarined in its rudest and most;
simple form, debt seems to have been considered·
as an obligation merely personal. Men had made
some progref~is towards refinement, before creditors
ac ~id sa right of feizinlg the property of ·their

dients for this purpose were all introduced originally
in communities, and we can trace .the gradual pro-
gref~s· of them. I. TThe simplest and most obvious
s pecies of fTecurity was, that the person who fold
any commodity thould receive a pledge from him·
who bought it, which he: restored upon receivitig
payment. Of this cuffom there are vestiges in

and contributed greatly to introdiuce regular go-

soon as communities were inflituted, high senti-
.men~ts of liberty began to appear. When Hum-

th~e inhabitants an oath of fidelity to himself and~
f]:uccellb~rs, they stipulated, on their part, that he

T1IHE observations wyhich I have made concernm-

ing the slate of cities, and the condition of their
inhabitants, are confirmed by innumer1able paflh~ges
in the hifforians and laws of the middle ages. It
is not improbable, however, that fodme cities of the
first order wyere in a better Rtate, and enjoyed a fu-
perior degree of liberty. Under the Roman go-
v ternment, the municipal government established
in cities was extrfemelyr favourable to liberty. The

jurifCdiAion of the senate in each corybr~ation, and
the privileges of the citizens, were both extensive.~
There is reason to believe, that some of t-he greater
cities w~hich efeaped the deffrudtive rage of the
barbarous nations, filil retained their ancient form
of government, at; least in a grea~t meas~ure. T~hey
were governed by~ a council of citizens, and by
]magiff~rates whorn they themselves eleated. Very

THfE Spanifih hifforians are almost entirely silent

concerning the origin and progress of communities
in that kingdom; so that I cannot fix with any
degree of certainty the time and manner of their
first introduaLion there. It -appears, however ,
from IMariana , vol. ii. p. 221, fol. H~agE;e ri36,
that in the year 1350, eighteen cities had obtained
a feat in the Cortes of C~astile. From the accotint,
which thall be given of their constitution andE
pretedfians, Sea. III. of this volume , it is evident
that their privrileges and form of government were
the fiame with those of thfe other feud~al corporat-
tions; and this, as we~llas the perfedS similarity

of -po~litical inititutions and tranfaAions in all the
feudal kingdoms , may lead us to conclude , that
communities were introdub~ed. there in the fame
manner, and probably about the fame time , as
in the o/ther nations of Europe. In Aragon, as I
thall have occallon to obs~erve in a subsequent
note, cities seem early to have acquired extensive
immunities, together with a share in the legifla-
ture. ·In the year n 18, the citizens of Saragolfa
had not only attained political liberty , but they
were declared to be los eqjual rank with the nobles
of the second class-; and many other immunities,
unknown to persons in their rank of life in other
parts of Europe , were conferred uport them.

tioni of privileges which they already enjoyed. See
Lord Lyttelton's Hiffory of* Henry~'II[. vol. ii.
p, a17. The English cities,, however, were ,very
inconsiderable in the twelfth century. A clear
proof . of this occurs in -the .hiffory to which I last
referred. Fitzftephen , a contemporary author,
gives a deferip~tion of the city of London' in the
reign of Henry II. and the terms in which he
speaks of its ·trade , its wealth, and the splendour
of its inhabitants, would fuuggeft no inadequate
idea of its slate ·at present, when it is the greatest
and most opulent city of Europe. But all ideas
of grandeur and magnificence are merely compa-
ra~tive. ;It appears from P~eter of Blois, archdea-
,,con of London , who flourished ;in the fame reign,
and who had good opportunity of being well in-
formed-, that this city, of which Fitzftephen gives
frch a pompous account, contained no more than
.fo~rty thousand inhabitants. Ibid. gr 4, ax 6. The
other cities were fmnall in proportion, a~ndin no con-

constitution of the boroughs in Scotland, in many
circumstances , resembled that of the towns in

SooN after th~e inrtroduction of the third ·efate

into the national council, the spirit of liberty
which that' excited .in France began to produce
conspicuous effedis. In several provinces of France,

the nobility and communities formed affciations
whereby they bound themselves to' defend their
·rf5ihts and privileges against the formidable and
arbitrary proceedhigs of the King. The Count
de Boulainvilliers has preserved a copy of one of
these associations, dated in the year I3I4, twelve
years after the admit~ion of the deputies frorn
towns into the States General. H-iffoire de I'ancien
gouvernement de la France, tom. ii. p. 94. The
vigour with which the people asserted and ]pre-
pared to maintain their rights, obliged their f~ove-
reigns to refpedt them. Six years after this affo-
cia'tion, P'hilip the Long ifflued a writ of su~mmons
to the comnmunlity of NTarbonne, in the following
terms :" Philip, by the Grace , &c. to our well-
beloved &~c. we de fre with all our heart , andI~
above all other things, to govern our kingdom

allow the·se :to be only the formal words of a pub-
]lick· and legal style , but the ideas are singular,
and much more liberal and ~enlarged than one
could expc~t in thait age. A popular monarch of
Great Britain could hardly address ~himself to pdr-
liament , in terms more favourable to publick:
liberty. Trhere occurs in thle Hiffory of France a
firiking instance of .the progress which the prin-
ciples of liberty had made in that kingdom, and
of the- influence which the deputies of towns had
acquired in the Stantes General. During the cala-
mities in which the· war with England, and the
captivity of King John,' had involved Firance, the
States General mwade a bold effort to extend their
own privileges and jur~ifiaiion. T~he regulations
eftablifhled by the States held Ah.D. 1355, con-
cernping . the mode of: levying; taxes, the adminiffra-
t.'ion of which they vefied not in the crown ,but:
i-n comrniffioners appointed by the States ; con-
ecrning the coining of money ; concerning the
'r~edrefs of the grievrance of purveyance; concerning
the. regular administration of justice; are much
more suitable to the genius of a republican go.
vernment than that of a feudal monarchy. TThis

concurred with thofie which I have mentioned in.
th~e text in procuring them delivera-nce from that

-religion; th~e doatrines which it teaches, concern-
ing the original equality of m~ankind; its tenets
concerning the divine governmsent, and the ign-
partial eye wi~th ·which the Almighty regards men
of ev-ery condition, and admits them to a partici-
pation of his benefits, are all inconsistent with s~er-
v-itude. But in this, as in many other instances,
considerations of interest, and the maxims of false
policy, ledyanen to a 'condua inconsist~ent with their
principles. They were so sensible, however of
the inconfifferncy, that to fiet their fellow-Chriftians
at l-iberty from frervitude was deemed anm aA of
piety high/ly meritorious and acceptable to heaven.
TJhe~ humane spirit of the Christian religion firug-
gled with the maxiims and manners of the world,
a2nd contributed more than any othner, circum-
itance to introduce the pradice of manumifion.
When Pope~ Gregory the Great, who flourifhedi
-toward the end of the sixth century , granted
liberty to some of his slaves, he gives this rea-
son for it, CC Cum redemptor nofter , totius

which set bounds to this pradice as detrimental

pressed all the reft. W~hen Louis X. iflued his

fused to accept of the liberty which was offered

TZHERE is no cuffom in the middle ages more

singular than that of private war. It is a right of
so great importance, and prevailed .so universally,
that the regulations concerning it make a Icorn-
fiderable figure in the fyfitem of laws d urin g the
m~iddle ages. IVI. de Mdontefqcuieu, who has un-
ravYelled so many intricate points in feudal jurif-
prudence, and thrown light on fomany cuffoms
~formerly obscure and unintelligible , was not led
by his fa~.bjeat to confider this. I shall therefore
give a more minute account of the cuffoms and
regulations which direbded a pr"aice so contrary

to the present ideas of civilized nations concerning
g~overnment and order.~ I. A~mong the ancient
Germans, as well as other nations in a similar
slate of fCociety, the right of avenging injuries was
a pri~vate and pers~onal right , exercised by force
of arms, wvithout any reference to an umpire, or
any .appeal to a magistrate for decision. T4he
clearest proofs of this were produced Note VI.
3. This practice iufabifted among the barbarous
nations after their settlement ini the provinces of
the Eimlpire which they, conqu~ered; and as the
causes of dissension am~ong them multiplied, their
family feuds and private wars became more fre-
quent. Proofs of this -occur in their early hisT-
torians. Greg. T~uron. hist. lib~. vii. c. 2.·1ib. viii.
c. I8. lib. x. c. 27. and likewifie in the codes of
their laws. It was not only allowable for the
relations to avenge the injuries of their family,
but it was incumbent on them. Tlhus by ~the laws

3. NJone but gentlemen, or persons of noble birth,
had the right of. private wvar. All difputles among
slaves, villani, the inhabitants of towvns, and free-
men of inferior condition, wTere decided in the
courts of juffice. All disputes betwyeen gentlemen:
and persons of inferior rank were terminated in
the fame manner. The right of private war sup-
posed nobility of birth, and equality of rank in

altogether decent for them to prosecute quarrels
in perlon, advo~cati or .vidames were chosen by the
fb rial monafiteries and bifhopricks. Thes~e were

war u~pon his adversary. Atrocious aAs of vio-

were legal and permitted motives for taking arms
against the authors of them. Such crimes as are

time juffified private hoffilities. Beauman. ch. lix.

But though the avenging of· injuries was the only
motive that could legally authori~se a private war,

yet disputes concerning civil property often gave
rife to hofnilities , and were terminated by the
£wvord. Du Cange Dissert, p. 332. 1 5. All per-

gree of affi~nity which obliged a person to take
part in the quarrel of a kinsman was curious.
W5hile the church prohibited the marriage of per-
sons within- the seventh degree of affinity, the
,vengeance of private war extended as far as this
,absurd prohibition, and all who had such a remote
connedion with any of the principals were in-
volved in the· calamities of war. But when the
church relaxed somewhat of .its rigour , and did
not extend its prohibition of marrying beyond the
fourth degree of affinity, the fame reffridtion took
place in the conduat of private war. IBeauman,

becaus~e both have the fame common kindred, and

war, because each of them has a diftinat kind~red~-
"`Beauman. p., 299. - 8. The· vassals of each prin.

wars were carried on with all the defirudive rage,
which is to bae dreaded~ froma viol~ent rerentment;
wthen armed with force, and authorised by law. It
.appears from the statutes prohibiting or restraining
the exercise of private hofitlities, that the invallon

HAVING thus colledted the chief, regulatioris

·which cuffom had eftablifhedl cocerning the ri ght
and exercis~e of ]private war , I shall enumerate iks
chronological or~der the various expedients employ-
ed to abolish or reitrain this fattal cuffom. r. T~he
first expedient employed by the civil magistrate in
order to set some bounds to the violence of private
revenge , was the fixing by law the fine or compo-
fition to be paid for each different crime. * The
injur ed person was originally the sole judge con~-
cerning the nature of the wrong which he had ful,
fered, the degree of vengeance which he thould
exat, as well as the sp~ecies of atonement or re-
parationa withi whichl he fbould reft satisfied. Rev

fentment became of courf'e as implacable ast ~it as
fierce. It was often a point of honour not to for,
give,; nor to be reconciled. T~his made it necef:
f~ary to fix those compositions whichi make so great
a figure in1 the laws of barbarous nations.. The
na~ture of crimes and` offences was effirmated by the
magistrate, and the fum due to the person offend$
was af~cert~ainaed wt~ith a minute , and of~ten a wvhimr
fical accur~acy. Rotharis , the legislator of the
3Lombards , w~ho reigned about the middle of the
seventh century, discovers his intention both in as-
certaining the compolition to be paid by the offen-
der, and in increating its value ; it is, says he, that
the enmity may be extinguish~ed, the prosecution
may c~ease, and peace may be reffored. Leg. Lon-
gob. lib. i. tit. 7. S r0. - 2. About the beginning
of .the ninth century, Charlemagne firuck at the
root of the evil, and enadted, C' That when any.
p'erfon had been guilty of a crime, or had com-;
mitted an outra~ge, he should immediately fubmnit
to. the penance which the chur-ch imposed, aInd·
offer ·to pay the compolition which the law pre-
Bcribed; and if the injured perfo~cn or his kindred
thould refuse to accept of this, and. presume to
avenge themselves by force of arms, their lands-
and properties thould be 'forfeited." Capital. A. D.
802. ;edit. Baluz. v~ol. i. 37r. - 3. But· in this, as
well as in oth~er regulations, the genius of Charle-
magne advanced before the sp~irit of his age. The
idreas of his contempora~ries concerning regular
~novernment were too imperfeat, and their man-

ners too fierce to submit to this law. Private wars,
with all the caltal~ities which they occallioned, be-
came more frequent than ever after the death of
that great monarch. His focceff~ors were unable
to restrain them. The church found it necessary
to interpofre. -The most early of these interpefi-
tions now extant, is towards the en~d· of the tenth
century. In the year 990, fevteral bilhops in the
south of Fr-ance ass~embled, and publiihed various
regulations, in order to set fonme bounds' to the
violence and frequency of private wars; if any
person ~within their diocefes thould venture to tranf-
grefs, they ordained that he thould be excluded
'from all Christian privileges during his life , and be
denied Christian burial after his death. Du Moant
Corps D~iplomatique, tom. i. p. 41. THhefe, how-
ever, were only partial remedies; an~d therefore a
Scouncil was held at Limoges, A. D9. 994. The
bodies of the faints , according to the custom of
those ages, were carried thither; and by these fa-
cred relicks men were exhorted to lay down their
arms, to extinguiL'h their animofities, and to ~swear
that they would not for thre future violate the pub-
lick peace by their private hostilities. Bouquet

other councils iliized decrees to the. fame effedt. D~u
Cange Dissert. 343- - 4. But ·the authority of coun-
cils, how venerable soever in those ages, was not
fufficient to abolish a cuff~om which flattered the
pridei of the nobles, and gratified their favourite
pafllions. The evil grew so intolerable ethat it be-

came neceffaLry to employ fupernatulral means for
suppressing it. A bishop of A'q~itaine, A. D.
Tog12, pr~etended tha~t an angel had appeared to·
him, and brought him a writiqg from heaven, en·
joining men to cease from their hostilities, and to·
be r-econciled to each other. It: was during~ a sea-
son of publiib calamity that he publlifh~ed this reve.
lation. T~he minds of men wer'e disposed to rei
ceive pious imprefirons; and willing to perform
any thing in order to avert the wrath of heaven.
A general peace and cessation from hostilities took
place, and continued for seven years ; and a refolu·
tion was formeld, that no mal thoulld in times to·
come attacke or molest~ his adlverfaries during the
seasons set apart fo~r celebrating the great festivals
of the church, or from the evening of thursday
in each week to the morning of M~onday in the
week ensuing, the interv~ening days beinlg confides
ed as; particulqrly holy, our Lord's Passion having;
happened on one of these days, and his Refurrec:
tion on another. A8 change in the difp·oitions of
.men so fCudden, and which produced a refrolution
fo.unexpedted, was considered as mhiraculous; and
the respite from hoffilities which followed upon it,

But· the influence of this fu~perifitious terro· -or de-

knonarchs to eniforce it. - 7. In ordier to reitraini
the exercifte oif private ilar still farther, Philip the~
Fair, towards the close of the fame century, A.DL
I296, pub~lifed an ordinance commandinrg all
privYate hostilities to ceaie, iihile he was engaged
in wiar againftC the enemies of the slate. Ordon.
tom.· i. p. 328. 390. This rekgulation, whichi seems
to be almost essential to the exiffence and prefer-
vation of fa~ciet~y, wias often renewed by his faccef~-
fois, and being enforced b~y the regal .authiorityi
pr-oved a considerable check~ to the defartitive c~on-
tests of the niobles. Both thaefe regu~latio~ns, intro-
duced first in France , were adopted by the other
nations of Europe. - 8. T~he evJil, however , aAas
so iniveterate, that it. did not yield to' all these re-
inedies. Nor faoner- was publick peace eftcablifhedi
in anyr k~ingdom, than- the barons rene~wed their
priviate heftilities. They not only fitruggl-ed to
maintain this pernicious right, but to sec~ure the
exe~rcise of it wiithout anly restraint. Upon the
death of Philip the Fair , the nobles of .difFerent;
provinces in ffrance foirmed affociationsj and present-
ed remonfirances to his farcce~ror, demanding the
repeal of fCeveral laws, by ,which he .had ab3ridged

Z4 a

the privileges of their order. Among there, the
righ-t of private war is always mentioned as
one- of the moR valuable ; and they claim, that
the reftraint-impofed by the truce of God , the royal
truce, as well as that arising from the ordinance of
the year I269 , thould be taken off. In forme in-
stances, t~he two sons of Philip , who mounted the
throne· successively , el-uded their· de~mands; in
others, they were· obliged to make concess~ions.

aances to which I here refer, are of furch length
that I cannot insert t~hem, but they are extremely
curious, and may be peculiarly infirudtive' to an:
Eng]ifh reader , as they throwy confliderable light on
that period of English hiffory, in which the at-
tempts to circumf~crbe the regal prerogative were
carried on, not by the people fitruggling for liber-
ty , but by the nobles contending for power,. It
is not neceffary' to produce anly evidence of the
continuance and ~frequency of private wars under
the facceff~ors of Philip the Fair.--9. A pradtice
somewhat similar to the royal truce .was intro:
duced, in order to firengthen and extend it. Bonds
of affirrance , or mutual security, were demanded
froni the parties at variance, by which they obliged
thernfelves ·to abstain from all hostilities, either du-
ring a time mentioned in the bond , or for ever; and
became fubjeat to heavy penalties , if they violated
this obligation. These bonds were fometimnes
granted voluntarily, but more frequently exaded
by the authority of the civil magifkrate. Upon a
pt-tition from the par ty who felt hims~elf weakest,

;the magiffra~te fulmmoned his adversary to appear·
in court, and obliged him to give a. bond ofaffix-
rance. If , after that , he committed any fatrtherj
hoffilities , he becamp. fubjeA to all the penalties of
treason, This reff raint on private war was known
in the age of St. Louis. Eftabl~ifements, liv. i. c.

Ordon. tom. ii. p. 4607. If this fa&t were certain,
it would ·go far towards explain~ing the peculiarity

English Adts of Parliament, which, according to the
remark of the learned author of the Obpervations on

h oods, it may be added, that this is not peculiar to
the laws of that country, Notwithfnanding the

statute which r~ecites a falsehood, T'his, however,
is not the place for difc'ufirng that point.' It is arn
inquiry not unworthy the curiosity of an English

IN Castile, the pernicious pradtice of private war

prevailed, and was authorized by the cuffoms and
law of the kingdom. Leges Tauri, tit, 76. cum
commentario~ Anton1. Gomezii, p.. 551. As the
Castilian nobles were no less turbulent than power-
ful, their quarrels and ]hostilities involved their·

country in many calamities. Innumerable proofs
of this occur in Mairiana. In Aragon, the right of
private revenge was likewise authorized by law;
exercised in its full extent, and accompaniedt with
the fatme unhappy consequences. Hieron. Blanca

THE Lombards, anad other northern nations who

fettled in Italy, introduced the fame maxims con-
cerning the right of revenge into that country, and
there were followed by the fame effeaes. As the

IN Germany the disorders and calamities occa.~

fioned by the ri~ght of private war were greater
;and more intolerable than ine anly other country of
Europe. The Imperial authority was so much
sh~aken and enfeebled by the violence of the civil
wars, excited by t~he contests between the Popes
and the Emperors of the JFranconjan and Suabian
,8ines, that not only the nobility but the chties
acqlir~ed almost independent power, and foi~orned
all~ fubordinatiorn and obediernce to · the lawics. The
f6requency of th~erefaide or private wars, are often
m-entioned in the German Annals, and the fatal
effea~s of them are most pathetically described ,

& pafiTm. The Ger-mans early a~dopted the Treuga
Dei, which wpas first eftfablifbecd in ~France. This,
howvever, proved but a temporary and ineffeatual
remedy. T~he disor~ders murltiplied so fafit, ands
grew s~o -enormous, that they threatened the diff~o--
lution of society, and compelled the Germans to
have r~ecourse to the only remedy of the evil, viz,
an absolute prohibition of private wars. The
Emperor , W~filliam , publish~ed his edid to this
]purpose, A. ~D. 1255,~ anl hundred and sixty years
previous to the Ordonnasce of Charles VI. in
France. Datt, lib. i. cap. 4. n". 20. B3ut neither
B~e,nor~ his successors had authority to secure the
observance of it. T'his· gave rife to a pradtice in:
Ger many~ 4 hich conveys to us a striking idea
both of the int~olerable calamities 'occafioned by
private wars, and of the fe-ebleness of gov~ernment:
dp~ring- the twelfth and thairtieenth centurjes. The

cities and nobles entered into alliances andl affocia-
tions, by which they bound themselves to mainq
tain the public peace, and to make war on such
as fh~ouldt violate it. This was the origin of the
league of the Rhine, of Suabia, and of many
hmaller confederacies djitinguifhed by various
names. T~he rife, progress, and beneficial effedts of
these associations are t'raced by Datt with great
accuracy. 'Whatever degree of publick peace , or
of regular adminiffration was preserved in the
Empire from th'e beginning of the twelfth century
to 'the close of the fifteenth, Germany owes to
ther~e leagues. D~uring. that period, political order,
refpedt: for the laws, together with the equal ad4
miniffration of juffice, made considerable progress-
in Germany. But the final and perpetual aboli-
tion of the right'of private war was not accom-
plifhed until A. D). 1496. Tfhe Imperial authority:
was by that time more firmly established, the ideas
of men w~~lith refp~edt to government and fu~bordi-
nat~ion were become more just. That barbarous
and pernicious privilege which the nobles had so
long p~offeffed, was declared to be incompatible
with wthq happiness and existence of society. In
order to terminate any differences which might3
azrife among the~ various members of the Germanick
biody, the Imperial chamber was inflituted with
supreme jurifdcicaion , to judge without appeal in
every question brought before it. That court has

table tribunal, of essential importance in the G~er man

during the ages of ignorance. I thall mention only
one, because we have an account of it: in a plap
citum or trial in the presence of Charlemagne',
from which we may learn the imperfedt manner
in which justice was administered even during his
reign. .In the year 775, a. conteRt arose between
the~ bishop of Paris and. the abbot of St. Denys,
concerning the proderty of a fmnall abbey. Each
of them exhibited deeds and records, in order to
pr~ove the r~ight to be in them. Infleadd of trying
the authenticity, or considering the import of
there, the point was referred to the judicium crucis.
JEach produced a person, who, during the cele-
brat~ion of mass , stood before the cross, with his
arms expanded; and he whose representative frirf1
became weary, and altered his porture ,;B left the
cause. TFhe person employed by the bishop on
tkhis occasio.n had less strength or less spirit than
his adversary , and the question was decided in
favpur of the abbot. Mabillon de re Diplomat.

has treated of the trial by judicial combat at con-
fiderable length. The two talents which di~in-
guifh that illuffrious author, induafry in tracing~
all the circumfiances of ancient and obscure infis
tutions, and sagacity in penetrating into the caus~es
and principles which contributed to establish them,
are equally conf)Sicuous.in his obs~ervations on this
fubjeat. To these I refer the reader, as they con-
tain mos1 of the pjrinciples by which I have end~ea-·
voured to explain this pradice. De l'Efprit des
Loix, liv. xxviii. It seems to be probable from
the remarks of IVL. de Montesquieu, as well as
from .the faats produced by IVdura,tor~i , tom. iii.
D-issert. xxxviii. that the appeals to; the justice of
God by the experiments with fire and water, &rc.
were pradifed by the people who fettled in the
different provinces of the R~oman Empire, before
they had recourse to the judicial combat. The
judicial combat, however , was the most ancient~
mode of term~inating any controversy among the
barbarous riations. in their or-iginal fettlemaents.
Thiss is evident from 'Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii.
c. Ix8. w~ho in~forms us, that all q~uestions which
were decided among the Romans by legal trial,
wvere terminated among the Germans by arms.
The fame thilng· appears .in the ancient laws and
customs of the Swedes, quoted by Jo. O. Stiern-
hooik de jure Sueonum & Gothorum vetuffo,· 4to.

< trfltomi of allowjrig judicial comb'ats appeared so
glaringly repugnant: to the precepts of religion,

were extremely delicate with reflpedt to every thing

fine. Leg. Sal. tit. xxxii. 5 .4. 6. By the law of

Thus `the ideas concer~ning the point of honour,
which we are: apt to confider as a modern refine-
ment , as w~ell as the pradice of duelling , to
which it gave rife, are derived from the notions
of our ancellors, while in a state of I'ociety veryt
little improv'ed.

-As NE; de Montefq~uieu's view of this fubjeca

did snot lead him to confider every circumst~ance
relative to judicial combats, I shall mention s~ome
particular fans necessary for the illuffration of
·what I have said with reiefpe to them. A remark-
able ini~ance occurs of the decilion of an abftradt
point of law by combat. A question arose in the
tenth century concerning the r.ight of repr~entation,
which was not then fixed , thoulgh now universally
established in every part of Europe. CC It was a
matter of doubt and dispute ( faith the hiss oriany ,
whether the sons of a son ought to be reckoned
among the children of the family, and su~ccee~d
equally with their uncles, if their father happened
to die while their grandfather was alive.- An
assembly was called to deliberate on this point,
and it was the general opinion that it ought to be
remitted to the examination and decillon of judges.
But the E~mpiror following a better course, and
defirouis of dealing honourably with his people
and nobles, appoirited the matter to be decided b~y
boattle between two champions. He who appeared
in behalf of the right of children to represent
their deceased father was vio~rio~us; and it was
eftabliihed, by a perpetual decree, that they fhoulld.
hereafter share in the inheritance together with
their uncles. " W~hittikindus Corbeinfis, lib, Ahnnal

If; we can suppose the caprice of folly to leatd men
to any adion more extravagant than this of fetL-
tling a point in law by combat, it milft be that; of

r~eferring

referring the tulth ors falfehoo-dl of a 'reigious opi--
nion to be decided in the fame maanneri. To' the
disgrace of humnan reason , it has beeni capable everi
of this extravagance. . A question wias agit~ated ini
Spain_ in 'the eleventhr century , wvhether the Mu=-
farabic ]Liturgy and 9'ituail wtihich had .been us~ed
in the churches of Spain, or thrat approved: of by
the See of Rtome, wNhich dif~fered in man~y piartil
culars fro~m the other, contained the for~m of
wEorfhip mosT accept~able to the DIeity. The Spa:
niards contended zealously for the ritual of their
ancestors. T~The Popes urged them. to receive that
to which they' had given t~heir infallible fanCaion.
A violent contest arose. The nobles proposed td
decide the controverty by the fwt·ord. The King:
approved of this mnethod of decision. Trwc
knights~ in complete armotic entered the lifts. Johrs
Riuybs de M~/atanca, the champion ofC the Mufar~abia
Liturgy, wras viaodrious. Buat the Queena and
Arch-bilbop of T~oledo, who 1favouzred the other
formsl infrifed on having the matter s~ubmitted to
another trial, and had interest enough to prevail

wvhich being considered as ari appeal to God, the

A great fire wans kindled. Ai copy of each Liturgy

of trial by combat , and of the prediledion for
·that mode ofdecillon occurs in the laws of the
Lombards. It wYas a cuffiom in the mid~dle ages,
that any perfcn might chufe the law to which he
wvouldl be fub~jeaCed; and by the ptreferiptions of
that law he was obliged to regulate his tranf.
adtians, without being bound to comply with any
pradtice authorized by other codes of law. ]Per,
so~ns who had fulbjeabed themselves to the.Ro'man
law, and adhered to the ancient juris~prudence,
as far as any knowledge of it wias retained in those
ages of ignorance, wrere exempted from paying
anly regard to the forms of proceedings established
by the laws of the Burgundians, Lombards, andi
other barbarous people. But the Emperor Otho,
in direaE contradiaion to this received mnaxim,
ordained, " That all persons, under wchatever lawr
they livedy~ even although it were the Roman law,
fliould be bound to conform to the ediAs con-
cerning the trial by combat. " Leg. Longob.

a charter or other infi~rumenlt was produced by one
of the parties, his opponent might challenge it,
affirm that it was false and forged, and offer to
prove this by comnbat. Leg, Longob, ib. S 34.
It is true, that among the reafbns enumerated byr

refuzfe to permit a trial by combat, one is,' " f the:
point in conteRt can be clearly provied or ascertain-
ed by other evidence. " Couff. de Beauv. ch. 63··

ly a single fiep. For the party wiho f~ufpeaed that:
a witnes~s wYas about to depos~e in a manner un-
favourable to his cause, might accuse him cif being
fatborned, give him the lie, and challenge him to
combat; if the witnets was vanquilhed in battle,

by whom he wYas su~mmoned to appear loRt his
caus~e. Leg., Baviar. 'tit. I6. 5 2. Leg. Burg~und,

given for obliging a witn~ers toa accejpt of a defi-
ance, and to defend himself by combat, is remarki
able, and contains the fame idea which is still the
foundation of what is called the point of honour;
" for it is just-, that if: an~y one aff~irms that: he per-
sealy knows the truth off anly thing, and offrs to
give oath upon it, that he thould not hesitate to

THAr the trial~ by judicial combat was efta-

·kno~n, and requires no proof. TLfhat this mode
·of decifiame~was freq~u-et,- appears -not only fi-ro
the~ cod~esi rs ancient- lawTIs whJich established it, but
from the earliest wtriters concerning thle practice of

hkave cobnfidered as ·of greater importeance; and
none on which they harve beffowed s~o much atten-
tion. ThSEe Tame obfervration will hold with refped
to the early authors of other -nations. It appaears
from Ma~adox,' that trials of this kin~d were to fre-
quent in En gland, that fines, paid on these occa-
fions, made no inconsider~able branch of the King's
revenue. HCift. of the Exc~heq. vot, i. p. .349. A

THIs mode of trial was so acceptable, that ec-

clefiafticks, notwithffanding the prohibitions of the
church, were confirained not only to connive at
the pradtice, but to authlorize it. A remarkable
instance of this is produced by PafTquier Rgecher-
ches, liv. iv. ch. i. p. 350. The abbot W~ittikin-
dus, whose words I have prodiuced in this note,
considered the determination of a point in law by
combat, as the best and most honourable mode of
decision. In the year 978, a judicial combat was
fought in the prefnce of the Emiperor Henry. The
archbishop Aldebert advised him to -terminate a
contest whichm had arisen between two noblemen of
his court, by this mode of decision. T~he vani-

THE text Contains the great outlines which m~ark

·the cours~e of private and public jurifdiAion in the
several nations of Europe. I fhalll here follows
more minutely the various fieps of this progress,
as the matter is curious and important enough to
merit this attention. T~he payment of a fine by:
wP~ay of fati~sfadion to the per~son or family injured,
wras the first device of a rude people, in order to
check the career of private ref~entmlent, and to .ex-
·tinguifh those saida, or· deadly feuds which wver~e
-prosecuted amronlg -them with? the utmof1 viole~nce.
This cuffom may be traced back to the ancient
G~errmans, TH~acit. de Ma~orib.· Ger~m. c. 27, and pre-
vailed among other un civilized nations. I~lany ex,
amples of this are colleded by the ingenious and'

the more ancient cqdes'of laws, that whlen the('e
ayere comf~iled. matters still remained in that simple

these fines was by the. featence of arbiters. An
arbiter 2s called in the Regiam majeftatem amica-
bilis compolitor, lib. xi. c. 4. g.i0. He c~ould efti-
mate the deg-ree of offence with more impar~tiality
than the par-ties interested, and determine wijth
greater equity what f~atisfadiion ougrht to be de-
mnandfed. ·It is difficul~t to bring~an authentic proof
of~a culffom previous to the records preserved in
any. nati~on of i·urope. But~one of the Formulae
AC~ndegavenfes compiled in the sixth century, feerns
·to allude to a'tranfadio~n carried on, not by the au-
th~ority of a j*!dge but by the med~iation of arbi-
ter-s. Bouquet R~ecueil des H~iftor. tom. iv. p. 466.
Bu~t as an arbiter wanted authority to enforce his
decillou~s, judg~es were appointed with compulffive
power. to oblige both parties to acquie~sce in their
cdecifions. Previous ·to this bast step, the expedient
of paying compositions was an imperfedt re~medyF
againit the pernicious effedas of private resentment.
As, focm as this important change, wa"l ~introduced:,
the magiffrate, putti~ng h'imfel-fin plac~e of the per-
Ibn inj'ured, ascertained the com~pofr-tion with
wshick .e ought to reft fCatisfie~d. Ever~y poss~ible

injulry that could occur in the inter~coulrfe of humanl
society, was considered and estimated, and the com-
politio'ns due to the person aggrieved were fixed
with s~uch mi-nute attention as discovers, in most
cafes, amazing d~iscernment and· delicacy; in Coine
inflances, unaccountable caprice. 1)efidkes the com~-
polition payable to the private par ty, a certain £urm
called a fredum, was paid. to the K~ing or Rtate, as
Tacituas expresses it, or to the fifcus , in the· lanl-
guage of the barbarous laws. Some authors ,
blending t~he refined ideas of modern policy with
their reasonings concerning ancient tranfBacions,
have imagined that the fr-edum was a com~penfattion
due to the community, on account: of the violation
of the' publick peace. But it is m~anifefily nothing
morye than the price paid to the magiffrate for thie
protea2ion which he afforded against the violenc~e of
ref~eatment. The enading of this was a confider-
able fl~ep towards improvement in criminal jurif-
prudence. In s~ome of the more ancient codes of
laws, the frreda are altogether omitted, or so fel-
dom mentioned ,that it is evident they were but
little known.. In the latter codes, the fr·edum is as
precisely specified as the compolition. In common

These fred~a made a considerable branch in the re-

prohlibited from levying any freda. In explaining

.great meafaure, the opinion of MI. de Montesquieu,
though I know that several learned antiqjuaries

of a judge. It is' evident, that at the time when
the barbarians f~ettled in the provinces of the Roi

among them with compulsive authority. Persons
vested with this charadter are mentioned by the
earliedt hiftosrians. Du Cange, voc. Judices. The
right of territorial jurifdiation was not alto~gether
an us~urpation of the feudal barons. There is
good reafbn to believe, that the powerful leaders
wvho seized different daiffridcs of the countries which
they conquered, and kept poffe~ffion of them as
alledial prope~rty, afifumed at the fame time the

right of jurifdiaion, and exercis~ed it within thieir
owYn territories. T'his jurifdidtion was· supreme,
and ex~tendedi to all causes. The clearelt proofs of
thlis are produced by M. Bouquet. Le Dr~oit pub-
dique de France eclairci,' &c. tom. i. p. 206, &c.
The privilege of judging his own vassals , appears
to have been originally a r-ig~ht inherent in every
baron w~ho held a fief. As far bac~k as the arclhives
of nations can conduat us wvith any certainty, w~re
find the juridiia~ion and fi~ef united. One of the
earliest charters to a layman which I have met with,
is that of L~udovicus Pius, A. D. 8r4. And it
contains the right of territorial-juri~fdi~ion , in the
most express and extensive terms. Capitul. vol. ii.
p. 1405.· There are many charters to churches
and monalteries of a more early da te , containing
grants of similar jurifd~idion, and prohibiting any;
royal judge to enter the territories -of thIofe churches
or monasteries, or to perform any ad of judaicial
authority there. Bouquet. R~ecueil des HTifti tom.

charters containing the fame immunities. Antig7.

obtainmng a featence mna court of justice during
the middle ages was so considerable, that this cir-
cumftance alone was f~ufficient: to r~ender men urn-
willing to decide anly contelt in- judicial form. It
appears from a charter in the thirteenth century~,

WH7VAT waS the extent of that: juriFdiaion which

those who held fiefs poffeffed originally, we can·
not now dletennmine with certainty. It is evident
that', during the disorders which prevailed in every
kIingdoin of Europe, the: grea~t vassals took ad·
vantage of the feeblenes~s of their iV~onarchs, and
enlarged their jurif~diations to the utmost. As
early as ~the tenth century, the more powerful
barons had usurped the right of deciding all

caus~es, whether civil or criminal. TShey had ac-
qu~ired the H-igh Juffaice as well as the Lozo.
Eftabl. de St. Louis, lib. i. c. 24, 26. Their
sentences were final;- and there lay~ no appeal from
them to anly fiiperior court. Several firiking in-
stanc~es of this are colledted by Bruffel, Trait&
des Fiefs, liv. iii. c. rr, ;r2, 23. Not faitisfiedi
.with this, the more potent barons got their terri-.
tories eredted into Regalities, with almost every
royal prerogative andi jurifdiation. Inflances of
there were frequent in France. Bruff. ib. In Scot-
land, where the power of the feudal nobles became
exorbitapnt, they were very numerous. H~istorical
Law-Tracts, vol. ~i. tradt vi. Even in England,
thoughl- the authority 'of the Normwan kings cir-
cu~mfcribed the jurifdi~tion of the barons more:
than in any feudal kingdom, several counties
palatine were eredted, into which the King's judges
could not enter, and· no wYrit could come in t~he
K~ing's name, until it received the r~eal of the
county pa1atine. Spelman. Gloss. voc. Comites
Palatini; Blackftone's Commentaries on the L~aws
of England, vol. iii. p. 78. T~here Jords of nega-
lities had a right to claim or rescue their vassals
fr~om the King's judges, if they afirumed any jurif-
diction over them. Bruffel, ubi futpra. In. the
law of Scotland this privilege was termed th~e
right of rep~ledgi;ng; and the fr~equency of it not
only interrupted the ·cours~e of juffice,, but gave
rif~e to o-reat d~isorders in the exercise of it. H-Iit.

gref~s and extent of ecclefinftical ~jurifdiation , with
an account of the arts which the clergy employed
in order to draw causes of e~very kind into the
sp~iritual cour t, is no less curious , and would
throw great light upon many of the cuf10ms and
inflitutions of the dark ages , b'ut it is like wife
foreign fr-om the present f~ubjea. D9u C~ange in

ledted most of the cause~s with ref~pedt to which
th~e clergy arroga~ted an exclusive jurifdicmon, and;

srefers of the authors, or original papers, whic'K
Zonfirmn his observations. Giannone in his Civil
Hiflory of Naples , lib. xix. 5 3, has ranged these
timder proper heads, and [crutinizes .the pretenr.
frons of the ch~urch with his ufkial boldnefs' and
disce~rnment. IVI. Fleur-y observes, that the clergy
Igultiplied the pretexts for extending the authorityr
of th~e [~piritual courts, at such a rate, that it was
jin their power to withdraw every person and every
cause from the jurif<iiation of the civil magiffrate.

how ill-founded soever the jurifdiation of the
clergy may be, or whatever might be the abuses
to which their manner of exercising it gave rife,
the principjles and forms of their jurisprudence
were far more perfed than that which was known·1
in the civil courts. It is probable that ecclefi-
aft~icks never submitted, during any period in the
middle ages, to the laws contained in the codes
of the barbarous nations , but were governed
entirely by the Roman law. TThey regulated all
·their tranfadions by such of its max~ims as were
p~reserved by tradition, or we~re contained in the
Theodosian code, and other books extant~among
them. This we learn from a cuffom which pre-
vailed universally in those ag-es. Every person was
permitted to chuke amon~g the various codes of
laws th·en· in force, that to which he was willing
to conform. hi any tratnfaflion of importance, it:
wvas usual for the pers~ons contradting· to mention
the litw~ to which they fabmitted, that it migh~t be
known how anly controverly that thould arise be-

tween them was to be decided. Innumerable proofs
of this occur in the charters of the middle ages.
But the clergy considered it as sauch a valuable pri-
vilege of their order to be governed by the Romani
law, that when any person entered into holy orders,
it was uiual for him to renounce the lawvs to. w~hich~
he ~had been formerly fubjeA, and to decIare that
h~e now submitted to the REEoman law. Confla~t me

aTHE COde of the canon law becran to be coni-

piled early in the ninth century. M~-~m. de l'Acad.
des Infeript. tom. xviii. p. 346, &ce. It: was above·
two-centuries aft~er that before any cblledion was
rnadf of those cus~toms, w-hich were the rule of
judgments in the courts of: the barons. Spiritual
judges decided, of course, according to written and
known laws ; Lay judges, left without any fixed
guide, were direded bty loose traditionary cuffoms.
But besides this general advantage of the canon
law, its forms and principles were more consonant
to reafron, and more favourable to the equitable
decision ofiLvery point in controverly , -than those
which prevailed in lay courts. It appegrs from Not~es

~XXI. and XXII. concerning private wars, and .the
trial ·by combat, that the whole s~pirit of ecclefi-
aff~ical jurisprudence was adverse to there fangui,
nary customs which were deftrudive of justice;
and, the wvhole force of ecclesiastical authority- was
exerted to aboifh~ them, and to fubititute trials by
law and evidence in their room. Alm~oftC all the
forms in lay courts which con~tribute to establish,~
and continue to preserve order in judicial proceed-,
iags, are borrowed from the can~on law. Fleury

Louis in his Eftabliffements confirms many of3~is
new regulations concerning property, and the ad-
ministration .of justice, by the authority of the
canon ·law, from which he borrowed them. Thus,
for instance, the first hint of attaching moveables
for the recovery of a debt, was taken from the
canon lawc. ftE>ab. liv. ii. c-. 2r. and 40. And
likewise the. cegio bonorum, by a pers~on who was

blifhed new regulations with refpedt to the effeats

and maniy other sa~lutary regulations, the .Cano-
nifts borrowed from the Roman law. IMany other'
examples might be produced of more perfedt ju-
rifprudence in the canon law than was known in
lay courts. For that reason it was deemed an~ high
privilege to be faubjectto ecclesiastical jurifdiaion.

THE rapidity with which the knowledge and
Rfudy of the Roman law spread over Europe, is
amazing. The copy of the Pandeats was found
at Amalphi, A. D. xx 37. ~Irnerius opened a col-
lege of civil law at Bologna a few years after.
Gian. HPift. book xi. c. 2. It began to be taught
as a part of academical learning in different parts
of· France before the middle of the century. Vac-
carius gave leaunres on the civil law at Oxford, as
early as the year Ix47. Ah regular' fyfitem of feu-
'dal laiv, formed plainly in imitation of the Ro-
man code, was compof~ied by two M~ilanese lawv-
yers about the year xx 50. Gratian published the
code of canon law, with large additions and emen-
dations, about the ~fam~e time. Tphe earliefte col-
ledtion of those cuffoms, which serve~d as the rules
of decision in the courts of jufftice, is the Aglifes de
Jerusalem. They were compiled, as the preamble
informs us, in the year 4 099, and are called Jus
Conf~uetudinarium quo regebatur regnum orientale.
~Willerm. Tyr.~ Jib. xix. c. z. But peculiar circum-
stances gave occallon to this early compilation.
The viAorious Crusaders fettled as a colony in a
foreign coumtry, and adventurers from all the dif-
ferent nations of Europe composed this new so~-
ciety.. It was neceffatry on that account to afrcer-
ta'in the laws and cuff oms which were to regulate
the tranfaations of-bufinefsi, and the adminifiration
gs juffice among them. But in .no country of Eul

rope,:vas there, at that timie·, any colledtion~ of
cuffornsjenot~had. any attempt -been made to render
law fixed. The first undertaking of that kind w6as
·by Glainvil~le , Lord Chief Juffice of Enlgland, in
his Tr·aaatus de Legibus&; Confuetudinibus ACn-
glia, <mm~pofed about the year I18r. The Re-
glam/1l~a~eftatem in Scotland, akcribed to Da~vid I.
feemls ito be an imitation·, and a ·fervuile one of
Glanville. Severa-l Scottip Antiquaries , under
'the influence of that pious credulity , w~hich dif;
poes ,men to ass~ent, without hesitation, to what-
ever they deem for the honour of their native
country, contend/zealoufly that the Regiam MI~aje-\
ftatem is a produaion prior to the treatise of Glan-
voille, and have brought themselves to believe
that a nation in a s~uper-ior [tate of improvement
borrowed its laws and institutions, from one con-
fiderably les~s .advanced in its political progress.
The internal etidence (were it my province to ex-
amine it) by which this theory might be refuted,
is, mi my opunion, decisive. The external circum-·
stances ·which have seduced Scottish authors into
this rnliftake, have been explained with so much
precision and candour by Sir David D8alrymple,, in
his Examination of some of the arguments for the
high antiquity of Regiamn Majei4atem, Edia. 1769.
4·to, that it is to be hoped th~e controversy w~-ill,
not be again revived. Pierre de Fontaines, who
tells us that; he was the firfl who had attempted
such a work in France, composed his Confeil,
wThich contains an account of the cuffoms of
the country of Vermandois, in the reign of

St, .Louis, whi~ch begari A. D. I2zi; Beauma.'
noir , the author of the Couff~umes du- Beauvoi/ts,
lived about the fame ·time. Thle:'Eftabliffeme nss
of;-it. Louis, containing a large 'colledion of
t~e· cuffoms which· prevailed within th-e royal do-
mainis, were published by the authority of thlat
monarch. As soon as men became acquainted
with the advantages ot~having writtenr .cuffoms and
laws to which they could have recours~e on every
occasion, the method of colleding them becarne·
common. Charles VII. of -France, by ani ordi-
nance, A. 3D. I4·53, appointed the customary lawcs
in every proavince of France to be colleded and
arranged. Velly and Villaret,,Hiftoire, tom. xvi.
p. Ing. H3is fazcceff~or, Louis XI. renewed the
injundion. ]But this falutaryt undertaking hath
never been fully executed , and the French jurit
prudence remains more obscure and uncertain than
if these prudent regulat~ions of their moniarchs had
taken effed., A pradtice was established in the
middle ages,, which affords the clearest proof that
judges, while they had no other rule to dire&t
their decrees but u~nwritteni and tra~ditionary cusS:
toms, were often at a lofCs how to find out the fadts
and principles,according to which they were bound
to decide. They were obliged in dubious cafes
to call a certain number of old men, and to lay
th~e cafe before them, that they might inform them
what was the practie or cuffom with regard to the
point. T`his was called Enqur7cofle p'ar tourbc. 3Du

the Roman jurisprudence have been explained b~y

to write a. hiI-tory of the progress of frcience. The
faas and observations which I have produced, are
fuffic-ient to illustrate the effeAs of its progress
upon manners and the state of society. WIhile
frcienc$ wvas altogether" extincl in the weffern par ts
of Europe, it was cultivated in Conflantinople and
other p~arts of the Grecian Empire. 13ut the ful>
tile genius of the Greeks turned ahnoft entirely to
theological disputation. The Latins borrowed
that spirit from them, a-nd many of the controver-
fies wchich st~ill occupy, and divide theologians,
took their rife among· the Gireeks, from whom the
other Europeans derived a considerable part of
their knowledge. See the te~timony· of J~neas

ans, though they neglected Homer, translated the

own language; and, guided by their pr~ecepts and
dis~coveries, applied thems~elves with great ardour

Nlamy proofs occur in hiff~ory of the little inter-

course between nations during the middle ages.
Towards the close of the tenth century, Count
Bouchard intending to found a monastery at~tt
1Vaur des Foffes, near Paris, a~pplied to an ala~bot

i-ntreating him to conduat the monks -thith~er,. T~he
Jan guage in wphich -he- addressed that holy man is
~Singular : He tells him ,that he ,had undert~akenr
the -lab~our of fa~ch a great journey; tha~t.he ·was
fatiguedl w-ith ·the length 0f it , therefore hoped to
obtain his request, and that: his journey into such
a distant country sh~ould not be in vain. Thean-
fwer O~f the azbbot..is still more extraordinar~y :He
refufedn to comply with his delire , as it would be
.extremely fattiguing to go along with him into a
firange an'd unknown region. Vita Burchardi

vol. x. p.· 35I. Even so late as the beginning of
the twelfth century ,the monks o~f Ferrieres in the
diocese~ of Sens did not k~now that there wcas such
a city as Tournay in Slanders; and the monks
of St. Maartin of Tournay were equally: unac-
quainted, with the situation of Ferrie~res. A trTnf-r
adio~n in which they were both concerned, made
it necessary ojr them to have some intercours~e.
TIhe mutual interest of both monalteries prompted
each to find out the situation off the other. Ahfter
a long s~earch, which is particularly described, the
dis~covery was made by accident. Herimannus

r-ance of the middle ages with refp~ed to the fitua-
tion and geography of remote countries was itill
more remarkable. The most ancient :geogr~aphical

art which now remains as a monument of the

fthe· of that fEcienCe in Euzrope dfuring the middle

ages, is found in a rnanufcript of the Chroniqjue
de St. Denys. There the three parts of the earth~
-then known are so represented, that Jerusalem is
~placed in the middle of the globe, and Alexandria
ap~pears to be as near to it as Nazareth. Mdtm. de

course which took place between different~ nationls.
Among people wYhofe manners are simple , and
wtho are feldomn vilited by firangers, ho~spitality is
a virtue of the first rank. This duty of hospitality
was ~so necessary in that slate of society which took
place during the middle ages , that it waCLs nlot~
conf~dered as one of those virtues which men may
·pcadife or not , according to the temper of their
~minds , and the gEenerofity of their hearts. H~of,
pitality was enforced by . Rcatutes, and fach as
negleded this duty were liable to punishment.

Slavi were more rigorous than any: that he men-
tions; they ordained, " that the moveables of an
inhorpita~ble person should be confiscated, and his
houife burnt. They were even so solicitous for
the entertainment of firangers , thath they permitted
the landlord to fleal for the fuxpport of his gu~est. :"

Beehr. ipf. I75r. p. 5o. In consequence of
these laws , or of ehat slate of society which made
it proper to enad them, hoifpitalityr abounded
while the intercourse among men was inconfider-
able, and secured the firanger a kindi reception
under every roof where he chose to take shelter.
This, too, proves clearly , that the intercourse
among men w~s rare, for as soon as this increaeedE,
what was a pleasure became a burden , and · the en-
tertaining of tr'avellers was converted into a branch
of commerce..

BUT the laws of the middle ages afford a proof

itill more convincing of the small intercourse be-
tween different nations. The genius of the Feudal
system, as well as the spirit of jealousy· which
always accompanies ignorance , concurred in dit
couraging firangers fro'm fettling in any country.
If a person removed from one provin~ce in a king
dom to another, he was bound w-ithin a year andl
day to acknowledge' himself the vassal of the
baron in whose estate he fettll if he neglecete

to do so,, he became liable to a penal-ty ; and if
at his death he negleated to leave a certain legacy
to the baron wYithin whose territory he resided,
all his goods were confifcateed. T'he hardships
imposed on foreigners feedIing9 in a firange country,
wcere still mior~e intolerable. I~n more early times ,
the su~per~ior lord of any territory in which a so-
reigner fettled, might; seize his ped~on , and reduce
him to servitude. Very firiking instances of this
occur in the hiffo-ry of the middle ages. The
cruel depredations of the Normans in th~e ninth
century , obliged many inhabitants of the Aiaritime
provinces of France to fly into the. interior parts
of the tkingdom. But instead of being received~
with that humanity to which. their wretched con-
dition enltitled th~em , thtey were reduced to a slate
of f ervitude. Both the civil and 'ecclefaiatical
powers found it necess~ary to interpiofe, in order to.
put a flop to this barbarous pradice. Potgieffer.
de Statu Servor. lib. i. c. I.~ ( x6. In other coun-
Stries , the laws permitted the inhabitants of the
maritime provinces to reduce such as were fhlip-
wrecked on their coast to s~ervitude. Ibid. 5 17·.
This -barbarous custom prevailed in many countries
of Europe. The pradice of seizing5 th~e goods of
pers~ons who had been shipwrecked, and of con-
fifcating them as the proper~ty of the lord on whole
manor they were thrown, seems to have been
universal. De W~eftphalen MTonum. inedita. Rer.

STPHE confusion and outrage wYhich aboundedf
;under a feeble form o~f government, incapable of'
·framing or executing salutary laws, rendered the
co~mmunication between the different provinces
of the fame kingdom extremely dangerous. It
'appears from a letter of Lupus, abbot of ]Ser-

.were so much infested by banditti, that it. was
·necessary for travellers to form themselves into
companies or caravans ,~ that they might be safe

WrraT refpedt to the progres~s of commerce

w~hic~h I have deferibed; p. 93, &c, it may be ob-
~served that the Italian states carried on some com-
merce with the cities of the Greek empire, as
early as the age of Charlemagne, and imported
into' their own country the rich commodities of
the East. M~urat, Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p. 882, In
the tenth' century, the Venetians had opened a
trade with Alexandria in Egypt, .Ibid. T'he in-
habitants of A8malphi and Pisa had likewise ex-
tended their trade to the fame ports. IV~urat. Ib.
p. 884, 885. The effeats of the Crusades in
increasing the wealth and commerce of thte It;ilian
states, and particularly that which they carried
on with the East, I have explained , page 34th of
this volume. They not only imported the Indian
commodities from the East , but ei~ablifhed manuz-
fadtures of cunious fabrick in their own country.
Several of these are enumerated by M~uratori inl his
D~issertations concerning the arts and the wueavinlg
of the middle ages. Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p. 349-
g99· They made great progress, particularly in
the manufadture of silk, which ha~d long been
peculiar to the eafitern. provinces of Asia. Silk-
ftuffs' were of fach high price in ancient Rgompe,
th~at only a few persons of the first rank were able
to purchase them. . Under Aurelian, A. DI. 270,
a pound offi~lk was-equal in value to a pound of
gold. Abfit ut auro fila penfeantur. Libra enim

Suftinian, in the sixth century, introdluced the art
·-of rearing filk-wormairito Greece , which rendered
the com~modity · fomrewhat. more plentiful, though
itill it was. of, fchi great value , as to remain ~a12
article- of luxury or magnificence, reserved 'onlyr
for persons of the -first order, or for publick.fo-
lemnities. Rolger I. K~ing oF Sicily , about the
year II30, carried off a number of artificers in·
the fiik-trade from APthens, and fettlingth~em in
Pa'lermo, introduced the culture of silk into his
kingdom, from which 'it was communicated to
other parts of Italy. Gsianon. Hist. of N\aples,
b.-xi. c. 7. This seems ito have rendered silk; so
;commoni, that about the middle o~f the· fourteendi
century, a thousand citizens of Genoa appeared in
one proceliron clad in silk robes.' Sugar is like·
wiife. a produation of the- East~. Some planlts of
·the fTugar-cane were brought from Asia; and the
-first attempt to cultivate them in Sicily wras made
about; th'e middle of the twelfti century. From
thlence they were transplanted into the southern
provinces of Spain. From Spain they were car-
ried to the Canary and Madeira isles, and at
length into the new world. Ludovico Guicciarr
dini, in enumerating the goods imported into
Antwerp , about the year 1560 , mentions the sugar
wvhich they received from Spain and P~ortu~gal as
a considerable 'article. Hfe deferibes that as the
produa of the Mladeira and Canary ifands. Def-
crit. de' Paefi Bassi, p. I80, I81. The fu-
gar-cane .was - introduced into the -Weft-Indies
before that; time, but the cultivation of it was

n~ot

niot to confiderabl'e as to furnish an article in com-o~
,merce. In t~he middle ages, though sugar was not'
~raif'ed in such quantities, or employed for so many
purposes, as to become one of the commhon necef-
firies of life, it appears to have been a confiiderable~
article in the commer~ce of the Italian sta~tes.

THIESE Va~rious com~modities w~tith w7~hich thie ItaQ

lians furnished the other nations of Europe, pro-
curled them a favourable reception in every king-
dom. They were elhabl~ifhed in France in the
thirteenth century with most extensive imm'unities.
They no~t only obtained every indulgence favou~r-
able to their comrmerce, b~ut personal r~ights alicd
priv·ileges were granted to them, which the natives
of the kingdom did not enjoy. Ordon. tom. iv.

largely a~s bankers. In an ordinance, A. D. I295,
we find them ftiled mercatores and camp/ores. T'hey
carried on this as wvell as other branches of their
commerce with· somewhat: of that rapacious spirit:
which is natural to monopolizers who are not re-
firained by the concurrence of rivals. An abs~urd
opinion, which prevailed in the middle ages, wias,
however, in some maeafulre, the caufre of their ex-
orbitant demands , and may be pleaded in apology

thle riches wyhich flowed into thes~e countries fi~rom
·t~heir extensive and lucrative commerce. The fir~t:
;source of wealth to tihe towns situated on the Bal-

th~oals of herrings fr~eiluenting at that time the coasts
of Sweden and DCenmarkE, in thq famne manner as
they now resort: to the British coasts. The effec2s
of this fishery are thus described by an author of
the thirteenth century. The Danes, says he, who
were formerly clad in the poor girb of sailors, are
now clothed in -fearlet, purple, and fine linen. Fo~r
they abound with wealth flowing f~rom their an-
nual fishery on the coast of Schonen; -so th~at all
nations resort to them, bringing their gold, silver,
and precious commodities, that they may purchas~e
herrings, which the divine bounty beffows upon
them. Arnoldurs Lubecenfis ap. Conring. de U~rbib.

IN England, the progress of commerce was ex4

During the Saxon heptarchy, England, spit into

as wFe/l as fach a sudden and total revolutidn of

during fekreral reigns. By the tim~e that the con-
R~itution began to acquire some stability, and t~he·
Englifhi had so incorporated with ·th~eir conquerors
Sas to become one people, the nation engaged with
no less ardour than imprudence in ~support of their
monarch's Ipretenfl~on~s to the crown ofFrsance·, and
long wasted its vigour and gen~ius in its wild es-
forts to Conquer that ktingdom. W~hen by ill sac-
cess, and repeated. disappointments, a period was.
at last· p~ut to this fatal frenzy, and. the nation beg
ginnin~g to enj'oy some repose, had leisure to breathe
and to gather new firength, the destructive wars
b~etw~een. the houses of Yf~ork and L~ancafiter broke!
out, and involved the kingdom in th~e worit of all
caam~ities. Thus., besides the common· obffr·uc-
ti~ons ofconmllerce occaflonect by- the nature of the
feudal government, and the· fate of manners du~-
ring the middle age's, its progress in England- was
retarded by peculiar caus~es. Such a fuceffion of
events a~dverse to, th~e commercal ipirt' was f~uffiien t
sto have checked its growth-, although every other
circumfitance had· favoured it. T~he English were
accordingly one of the last nations in Europe who
availed ·themselves of their natur~al commercial ack-
vantages. Before the reign of ~Edward III. all the
wool of England , excep~t a Eimall quantity wYrought
into coare cl~oths for home cons~umption, was fold
to the Flemnings or Lomnbards, and m-anu-factured

Ziurita, Ibid. 18 i. Blanca, 656. From anotlyler
passage in Zurita, it appears, that while the Ara-
gonefe enjoy ed the privilege of the union, i. e. the
power~ of confederating agairtft their sovereign as
.oft~en as they conceived that he hadi violated any
of their rights and immunities, the Juftiza was not
only nominated by the Kin g, but held his office
during the King's Qleafure. Nor was this pradice
attended with anly bad effe As, as the privilege of
the urnion was a fufficient andl eflfeasala check to
alny abuie of the royal prerogative. But when the
privilzge of the union was abolished as dangerous
to the order and peace of society, it was agreed
that thle Juftiza th~ould continue in office during
life. Several Kings, however., attempted to re-
move the Jufizas who were obnoxious to ·them,
and they sometimes succeeded in the attempt. In
order to guard against this encroachment, which
would have destroyed the intention of the inrti-
tution, and have rendered the Jiuffiza th'e depen-
dant and tool of the crown, instead of the· guar-

:dian of the people, a law'~was .enadedl in the Cortes,

reason was, by the laws of Aragon, ,the .rices-

but -as it was necessary for the fecurityT of liberty,
that the Juffiza should be accountable for ·the
manner in which he .executed the high-a trust re-
pos~ed in him, it was a powerful restraint upon him
to know that he waits liable to be punish~ed with

I HAVE been induced, by the concurring tefti-
mony of many ref~pedtable authors, to mention
this as the confitiutional formr of the oath of alle-
gliance, which. the Aragonef~e swore to their Sove-
reings. I muff acknowledge, however, that I
have not found this singular oath in any Spanilbi
author whonri 1 h~ave ·had an opportunitly to con-
salt. It is mentioned neith'er by Zurita, nor
Blanc'a, nor Argenfola, nor Sayas, who were all
hifforiographers appointed by the Cortes of Ara-
g~on to record :the tranfacaions of the ki-ngdom.
All these writers possess~ a'merit, which is very rare
among hlfforians. They are extremely accurate
in tracing the progress of the law\s and. conflitu-

tio-n of: their~,couritry. Their silence wirvth re~pren
to .:this·, creates ~some; fifpicion concerning thie 4e
:nuienef~s of ·the: oath. But as it is mentioned bY~
so niany': uthors, who produce the ancient Span~i~h'
words in wthich it is expreffred, it is proba~ible that
they have taken it from famne writer of credit,
whose viorkEs have not fallen into my hands, The
sp~ri~t of: the oath is·:perfe~ally agreeable to the geni.

catiion of the-firft edition, the learned IV. Totzen,
Priefeffor of HiR'ory at Baltzow in the D9utchy of

to :me a Spanish iiuthor of ·great authority, who
has publinhed the words of this oath, It is Alic
tonio Perez, a native of Aragon, flecretary to Philip

tioned in the pr~eceding note, and alluded to in

TIhis union did not refremble the confederacies in
other feudal kingdoms. It was a constitutional
association, which pretended to legal, privileges,
wvhich iss~ued its mandates under a common-feal,
and proceeded in all its operations by regular and
ascertained forms. Th1~is,dangerous right was not
only claimed, but exercised. In the year I287,
the Ahragon7efe formed an union in opposition to
~Alfoino III. and obliged that King not only to
comply with their demands, but to ratify a privi-

remained extremaaely free. Oane source of thi<
liberty was from the early admillfion of the r~epre

torian s~o accurate as Zurita, wopuld niot have used
these words, if he~ had not taken thern from fame
ituthentick record. It was more than a century
after this period before the reprefentativges of cities
formed a -confituent -part- in the supreme affem-
blies- of the other European nations. T-he Ifree
IJpi-rit of the .Aragonefe government is conspicuous
in many particulars. The Cgortes not onlyr 0.p-
pefed ·the attempts of their Kings to increase their
revenue, or to extend their prerogative, but they
claimned rights and exercised powers which will
appear extraordinary even in a country accuffomed
to tlhe enjoyment of liberty. In the year x 286,
the Cortes claimed the privilege of .naming thes
members of the Iting's council and the officers of
Jhis household,· and they f'eem to have obtained it
for s~ome time. Zurita, tom,- i, p. fog.., go?. -It
w\as the privilege of the Cortes to name the officers
wrho commanded the troops raised by their. aux-
thor-ty. This seems to be evident from a pallage
in Zurita. W&hen the Cortes, in the year r50g,
raifedl a body of troops to be employed in Italy,
it passed an aA emnpowering the King~ to name
the officers, who thould command them. Zuri-ta,

t~his warrant, it did not belong to him in virtu-e

Tlhey are offuckrlength, that I cannot insert ·them;.

in an~y kingdom in Europe; Lib. i. p.· 7. 9. The

;bl~ifted laws and editrnms of Ara'gon, no foreigner·
had libetilty to~enter the ·hall in· which the Cortes
aff~emibled. FTe~itdinand, in the year r48r, jP-
pointed his Q~ueen, Isabella, regent of the king-
dom, ~whild he was absent d~uring the course of the
campaign. The law re'quired that a regent thould
take the oath of fidelity in presence of the Cortes;
but as Ifab~jella vias a foreigner, before she could
be admitted, the Cortes thought it neceffarp to
pass an adt authorizing~ the ferje~ant-porter to open
the door of the hall, and to allowY her to enter;

TfHE militaryi order of St. Jag~o, the naoft ho-

nourable and opulent of the three Spanish orders ,
was instituted about th~e year 1170, The bull of

wa~s fubjea to she Moors, and the wchole cou-ntry
much exposed to ·the depredations not onily) of the

that an -inititution, the objeat of which - wa~s t o!
oppose the enemies of the Chriitian faith, and to

.ret~rain· and punish those who diflurbed the pub.
Slick peace, thould be extremely ,popular, and meet
with general encouragement. The wealth and
power of the order became foq great, that one his-
torian'fays, that the Grand M~aster of St. Jago w~as
the person in Spain of greatest power and dignity
n~ext to the King. 181. Anton. Nebriffenfis, ap.

-that· the order poffeffed every thing in Castile thslt
a King wjould most desire to obtain. Zurita
Annales, v. 22. The knights took the vows of
obedience, of poverty, and of conjugal chastity.
By the former they were bound implicitly to' obey
the commands of their Grand M~aster. T~he order
could bring into the field a thousand men at arms.
-IEl. A4nt. Nebref: p. 813. If thes~e men at: arms

was a formidable body of cavalry. There he·

-to his sovereign the command of; these ·troops, the
adminiitration of such revenues, and the disposal
of ~o' many offices, muff have rendered a fulbjedt.
The other- two orders, though inferior to that of
·.St; Jago ·in power and wealth, were nevertheless
very considerable. When the conquest of Gra-
nada deprived the knights of St.' Jago of those
·enemies against whom their zeal was ·originally~
.direded j fuperitition found -out a· nevr objeat, in

adeferice of which they engagedE to .employ the'ir
·courage. To their usual oath, th~ey added the
~fo~llwing clause; " W~e do swear- to believe, -to
maintain, a~nd to contend in publick and in -pri-
yate~, th~at the Virgin Mary, the mother of God ,
oulr Lady, - was conceived without~the stain of ori.

about' the middle of the feventeentih century. Ho.

conceived in terms more theologically accurate
than that of St.· Jago, may aeford some amuse-
ment to an English reader. C' I vow to God, to

tain and contend, that the Virgin Mary, IMother of

Science du Gouvernement, tom. ii. p. 3I. -It is
impossible, howlever, to conceive two states of civil
society more unlike to each other, than that of the
French nation under Clovis, and that under Louis
XV. It is evident fhrom the codes of la~ws of the
va'rious' tribes wFhich fettled jin Gaul and the coun-
tries adjacent to it, as well as from the hiffory of
Gregory of Tours,-and other early annalifts, that
among all these people the form ·of government·
was extremely rude and simple, and that they had
Ecarcely begun to acquire the first rudiments of
that order and police which are necessary in ex-
tensive s~ocieties. TPhe King or leader had the comm-
mandd of soldiers or companions, who followed his
standard from choice, not by confiraint. I havy
produced the clearest evidence of this, N~ote VI.,
Air event related by Gregory of Tkours, lib. iv.
A; 14. affords the most firiking proof of the de-
pendence of the early Eriench Kiings on the fTenti-
ments and inclinations of their people. Clotaire L,
haviing marched' at thie head of his army, in the.
year 563, against~ the Saxons, that people, intimi-

datbd·- at his approach, s~ued. for pe~ace, and offered
to pay a large fum to the offended monarch. Clo-
taire was willing to clofCe with what thepy proposed.
But his army insisted to be led forth to battle. T~he
King employed all his eloquence to perfluade them .
to,; aiccept of what the Saxons were ready to pay.
T1he Saxons,~ in order to sooth them, increased their
original offer. The K~ing renewed his folicita.
Ptions: But-· the army enrag-ed, rushed upon the
King, tore his -tent in pieces, dragged him out of
it,, and would have slain him on the spot, if he
hadE not codfented. to lead themr instantly against
the enemy.

IF the ea~rly monarchs of France poifeffed su~ch·

limited authority, even while at, the head of the~ir

not by a~ny hbreditary right, but in consequence of

failed. Annallts Metenfes, ap. Du Cange, ibid.

taxation was to ascertain the value of these gifts
.lhich were originally gratuitous, and to conp'el
the people to pay the fam at which they were rated.
Still, however, fomle memory of their original was
preserved,- and the aids granted to monarchsin all

'There are twio capitularia which convey to us a

the weight of any grievance, they had a right to'

might be exemp~ted from bearing arms, and from
serving in perflon against the enemy., is still extant.

T~rAIT important; change which the. constitution

of F'rance- under~went, when the legillative power
w~as tratnsferred from. the great contacil of the

~n to the King, has been explained by the
bech antiquaries with less care,· than theyr'
owv~ in illuff~riting other events in their hiffory.
t~'hat reason I have endeavoured wyith greater

attcputisn to trace the fieps which l~ed; to: this mae-
inorable revolution. I fihall here add frome par~ti-;
culars which tend further to illuffrate it. The
keges Salicse, the Leges Burgundionum;, and other
ccodes published by the several tribes which f~ettled
in: Gaul, were general laws extending to every
person, to every province and diftriA where their
authority was a~cknowledged. But the~y freem to·
hav~e become obs~olete; and the reason of their
falling into disus~e is very obvious. Almost the
wh~ole pro~perty of the nation wa~s allodial when
thes~e laws were framed. B~ut when the feuldal in-
itutions became general, and ·-gave rife to an
infinite variety of questions p~c-uliar. to· that species
bs ·tenure, the ancient codes were of no! us~e in
deciding with regard to tl e~, because they could
not contain regulations applicable to cafes which
did not exist at the time when they were compiled.
This considerable change in the nature of pr~operty
rnade it neceffaryl to publish the new regulations
containe~d in the Ca~pitulariaS IV~any, of these , as
is evident from the perusal of themb', were publick
laws extendling to the whole Firench nation, iix
the general assembly of which -they w~ere enatded.
The weakness of the greater part of the monarehs
of the second ryce, and the disorder into which
thle nation w~as thrown by the depredations of the
Normans, encouragedi the barons to ofarp an in-i

Sdependent· power fornierly unknown in Frenc(

T'H~e nature. and extent of that jurifdiaion :whif
th~ey assu~med , I have formerly considered. 'Thl
political'-nion of the kingdom was at an end, I:
anlcie-nt constitution· was. dissolved ,andH only a:
;fudal'relation fabfited between the King and his
va~ssals. T~he regal: jur-ifi~tion extended no for,
theri 'thain the domains· of~ the crown. UTnders th
last~ Kings of the second race, these were reduc
alnriof to nbthing. Ujcnder the ·first Kings of the~l
third race, they comprehended little more than
the patrimonial estate of Hugh Capet, which he
annexed to the crowvn. E~ven with this accefiogb
they continued to ~be very narrow. Velly, Hist d
France, tom. iii. p. 52. Many of the amoRt co I!I
derable provinces in France did not at fkfit

Trhere are itill <;xtan~t several charters, grante[

was thus openly dfifputedyi was not in a condition
to assert the rd~yal jurifdiAion, or to limit thato
the ·barons.

,ALL. there circumffances i-~ndered it easy fs

the barons to usurp~ the rights of. royalty w~ithiP
their own territories. The capitularia became no
less obsolete than.the ancient iaws; local cuitores

derreevery where introduced , and becamne the sole
the by which all civil tranfadtions were conduaed,
(0 all causes were tried. The wonderful igno-
hene , whichl became .general in France during
.he ninth and ten h centuries , c~ontributed to the
atro~d-uaion of cuffomary law. Few persons, ex-
;ept ecclefiafticks , could readl; and ?Is it wais not
n the power of such illiterate persons· to have re-
:ourfe to wtritten laws, either as their guide in bu-~
inefs , or their rule in~ adminiff ering justice, the
;uffomary Ja~w univerfatlly prevailed.

Dame ~this period, the general aff~enably of
:he nation seems not to have been called , nor to
iave once exerted its legislative authority. Local
affoms regulated and decided every thing. Ah
triking proof of this occurs in tracing the pro-
riefs of the French jurisprudence. T1he last of
lie Capitularia colleAed by M/I. Baluze, was iflh~ed
n the year 9 x , by Charles the Sirmple. An
iundred and thirty years elapsed from that'period
to the publication of the first ordinance of the
Kings of the third race, contained in the great
colleation of M1. Lauriere, and the first ordidance
which app~ears to be an adR of legislation extend-
ing to the whole kingdom, is that of Philip Aua-
gallus , A. D. 1 190. Or don. tom. i. p. 1 , I 8.
During that long peri~od of one hundred and sixty-
nin'e years, all tra~nfadions were diredted by local
diffoms, and no addition was made to the ftatu-
tory law- of France. The: ordinances,- previous to
tim reign of Philip Auguffus, coiltain regulations,'

t~he 'authority of which did noti extend beyond the
King's diomainsi.

.Eftabliffemens of St. Louis , though well adaptd
to fervie as generalI laws to the wthole kingdomj
were not publinled as ~such , but only as a complete
code of cuffornary lawY, to be of authority within
the King's domains. The wisdom, the equity and
the order conspicuous in that code of St. Louis,
-procured it: a favourable reception throughout dile
kingdom. Theve~neration due to the virtues and
gbod intentions of its author , contr-ibuited not &
little. to. recon~cile the nation to that legiflatike
author~itye-is which the K~ing· beg~an to affuime. Sooa
. after his time, the idea, of the King's ]poffefiTnt

ghpreme legislative power became common. If,
says Beaumanoir , the Kii~g makes anly establish-
ment specially for his own domain, the ,barons
may nevertheless adhere to their ancien-t cuffoms,
but if the eftablifhmentt be general, it fhalll be
current throughout the whole kingdom, and we
ought to believe that such establishments are made
with mature deliberation , and for the general
good. Cout. du Beauvoifis, c. 48. p. 265.
Though the· Kings of the third race did not call
the gen~eral ass~embly of the nation, during the
long period froni Hugh Capet to Philip the Fair,
yret they seem to have consu~lted the biflhops and
barons who happened to be present in their court,
with refped to any new law which they publis~hed.
Examples of this occur, Ordron. tom. i. p. 3 &~ 5i

THE assemblies diftingulifhed by the name oaf
the States General, were first called A. D. rso2,
and were heeld occasionally from that period to
the year ;E614, since which time they have not
been fammoned. These were very different from
the ancient asse~mblies of the French nation underc
the Kings of the first and second race. T`here is

no point with refp~ea to-which the French anti.
quaries are m'ore generally agreed, than in main.

thepaffing of law~s ,and poffeired no proper legis.
lati~ve jurifdilaion. T'he whole tenor of the French
hillory confirms this opinion. T`he form.0fpro-
ceeding in the States General was this. Th1e King·
add~reifed himself 'to the whole body al~embled in
one place, and laid before them the affairs on.
accou·nt: of which he had fummraoned .them. T~Bhe
ddjsuties of ea~ch of the three orders, of nobles, of
clergy , and of the third estate , met apart , and
prepared th~eir cahier or memorial, containing their
anfwYer to the propositions which had been made
to th~em , together with the repres~entations which
they thought proper to lay before· the King. T'hefe
answe~rs and representations were considered by the
King in his council, and generally gave rife · to an:
ordinance. Thief~e ordinanices w'ere not a~ddreffiedf

IF the parliament of Paris be confeidered only

as the supreme cdourt of juffice, every thing rela-
tive to its origin and jurifdiation is clear and ob-
vious. It is the ancient court: of the King's palace,
new-modelled, rendered sedentary, and invested
with an extensive and ascertained jurifdia~ion. THhe
power of this court, while employed in this part
of its fulndions, is not the objea of present: confi-
derat~ion. The pretenflons of the parliament to
controu'l the exer~cise of the legislative authority,
and its claim ofr a right to interpos~e with refpedt
to publick affairs and the political administration
of the kingdom,- lead to inquiries attended with
great difficulty. As the officers and members of
the parliament of Paris were anciently nominated
by the King, were paid by him, and on s~everal
occasions were removed ,by him at pleasure,
(Chronic. Scandaleuf"e de Louis XL dfans le~s
VId~m. de Comines, tom. ii. p. g r. Edit. de JVI.
Lenglet de Frefnoy) they cannot be considered
as represe~ntatives of the people, nor could they
claim anly share in the l'egiflative power as adting
in their name. Wiie must s~earch for s~ome other
f~otrce of this high privilege. T~he parliament was
originally compos~ed of the most eminent persons
in the kingdom. The peers of France, ecclesia-
flicks of the hig~hest order , and noblemen of
illuffrious birth were memnbers of it , to wchom
were added some clerks and counsellors learned in

court thus constituted was properly a committee
of the States General of the kingdom, and was
.composed of those barons and fideles , whom the
'Kings ofFrance were accuffomed to consult with
·regard to every ads of jurifdiefion or legiflajtive
authiority. It was natural, therefore , durin~g the
.inter'vals betwyeen the meetings of the States G ene-
ral, or dlaring- those periods wYhen that assembly
w~~as not called , to cons~ult the parliament, to lay
matters of publick concern before it, and to ob-
.taint its approbation and concurrence,, before any
ordinance was ·published , to whzichi the people
were relquired to conform. 2. Uender the second
race of Kiings, every new law was reduced into
proper form by the Chancellor of the kingdom,
w~as propo~sed by him to the p~eople-, and whena
enaded, was committed to him to be kept among
the pulblick records, that he might: give authen-
tick copies of it to all who thlould demand them.

held by the comes, or mnii~lls dominicus. Scabini
were the judges, or the affeffors of the judges in
that court. Here then s~eems to be a v~ery early
instance, not only of laws being published in a
court of juffice, but of their b~king verified or
confirmed by the subscription of the judges. If·
.this was the common pradtice, it naturally inltro-
duced the verifying of ediats in the parliament of
P~aris. But this conjeature I propos~e with that
dliffidence, which I have felt in all my reasonings
.concerning the laws and institutions of foreiga
nlat~ions. 3. T~Hhis f'upreme court of justice in France
was dignified with the appellation of parliament,
the name by which the general assembly of the
iajtion was distinguished towards the close of
the fCecond race of Kings; and men, both in1
l'eaf~ouing and in condua , are wonderfully infilu-
enced by, the fimilajrity of names. T~Ihe pres~erving;
the ancient names of the· mag~ifrrates eftabilihed
while republican government fublifted in Rfome,
enabled Augaff~us and his fulcceff~ors to assum~e new
.poiwers,' with less dobferai~ition and· greater ease.
T~Hhe beftowilng the fame name in F~rance upon two

4G ga

courts-, which were extremely different, coritri.
butedi not a little \to confound their jurifdidtion
and fundious..

ALL~ there circuimffances concurred in fleadin g

t-he -Kin~gs of France to avail themlfelves of the
·parliament of Paris, as the inftrumlent of reconcil-
ing the people to thieir exercis~e of legislative autho-
r·ity. The French, accustomed to fee all new lawYs
examined and authoris~ed before they wer~e pub-
lifbed, did not fufficiently distinguish betweena the
e~ffed of ·performing this in the nlational assembly,
or in a coti'rt appointed by the King. B~ut as that:
court was compoifed of refpedlable members, and
well inkilled in the laws of their count~ry, wMhen any
new ediat received its faI~n n, th~at w~as fufficient
to dispo~se the people to Implicit fubmillion.

WIIHEN the pradtice' of ver~ifyinmg and reggJ~ering

the royal ediAs in the parfliarrent of ]Paris became
cominon, th~e parliament contended that this was
necessary in order to gpive them legal authority. It
was established as a fundament~al maxim in French
jurisprudence,_ that no law could be published in
any o~ther~ manner; that, wvithout this formality, no
ediA or ordinance could have any effedt; that the
people were not bound to obey it, aind qught not
to confider it as an edid or ordinance until it was
.verified in the fulpreme court, after free delibera-
tion. Roche-flayin des Parlemens de France, 4to.
Gen. r62r. p. 92 . The parliament, at different
times, hath with great: for titude and integrity

opposed the will of threir sovereigns; and notwithe
standing their repeated and peremptory requisitions
and commands, hath relfufed to verify and publish
such edias as it conceived to be oppressive to the
peop~le, or sub~versive of the constitu~tion of the
kingdom. Roche-flavin reckons, that betwveen the
year 1562, and the year r589, the parliament re-
fused~ to verify more than a hundred edidts of th~e
Kings. Ibid. 925. Many instances of the spirit and
constancy with which the parliaments of France
~opposed pernicious laws;, and asserted their own
~privileges, are enumerated by Limmeus NJotitiki~
RHegni Franciae:, lib. i. c.. 9. p. a224.

BUT the power of the parliament to ~maintain

and defend this privilege, bore no proportion to its
importance, or to the courage with whicirthe mem-
bers asserted it. When any maonarch was deter-
m~ined that an edit thould be carried into execail

As I have endeavoured in the hifteryr to trace

the various fthps in the progreffs of the conflitu-
tion of the Empire , and to explain the peculiarities
in its policy very fu~lly, it is not neceff'ary to addE
mnuch by wYay' of illuffration. WIhat appears to-
be of anay importance, I fhlall· range und-er diftinc%

revenue of the Emperors. ~A very just idea. of
these may be formed by attendling to· the viewii
WYhich Pfeffel gives of the rights of the Emperor-s
at; twio difFerente periods.~ The sirs1 at the cr~ofe of
the' Saxon race, A. 3D. Izo24. Thre4~, accordincg to
his .enum~eration , were the ricght: of conferrinlg all
thle great ecclesiast~ical benefices in1 Germany; of
rseceivingS th~e xrevenu~es, of~ them dur~ing a vacancy~;

of Mlort-main, or of succeeding to the effeats of
ecclefiafticks who died intef~ate. Tfhe right of con-
firming, or of annulling the elea~ions of the Popes.
T~he right of assembling councils, and of appoint~-
ing them to decide concerning the affairs' of the
church. The right of conferring the title of King
upon their vassals. The right of granting vacant
'fiefs. T~he right of receiving the revenues of the
Empire, whether arifixig from the Imperial do-
maiins, from impoffs and tolls, from gold or silver
mines, from the taxes paid by the JewTs, or from
forfeitures. ~The right of governing Italy as its
proper sovereigns. T~he right of ereCding free
cities, and of efnablifhing faiirs in them, T~he right
of assembling the diets of the Empire, and of f~ix-
ing the time of their'duration. The right of coin-
in g money , and conferring that privilege on the
slates of the Empire. TBhe right of adminiffering
both high and lowv justice -within the territories of
the diff~erent Rtates. Abrigi, p,-160. THhe other
Iper~iod is at: the exrtindtion of the Emperors of the
families of Luxemburgh and Bavaria, A. D..i437- .
A~ccording to the fame author , the Imperial pre-
rog~atives _at that time were..the righ't of c~onferring
all dignities and titles, except the _privilege of
beingr, a slate of the Empire. Tfhe right of Preces
primaria, or of a ppointia g. Once during their reign
a dignitary in each chapter or religiouas hous~e.
IT~he right of granting difpendfations with refped
to the age o~f majority. ,T~he right of e'r~eding·
cities, and of conferring the privilege' of coining
mnoney. The right of calling the meetings of the

diet, and of presid~ing in them. AbrigP, &c. p.
go7. It were easy to sh~ow that M1r Pfe~ffel is well
founded in all thefie assertions , and to corifirm the~m
by the teffimony of the most; refpediable authlorp.
lIn the one period~, the Emperors appear as mighty
sovereigns with extensive prerogatives; ·in .the
other, as the heads of a confederacy with very-
limited powers.

THE revenues of the Emperors decreased itill
more than their authority. The early Emperors,
and particularly those of the Saxon line, besid~es
their vast: patrimonial or hereditary territories, pof-
sessed an extensive domain both in Italy and Ger-
many which belonged to them as -Emperors. Italy
belong~ed. to the Emperors as their proper king-
dom, and the revenues which they drew from it
were very considerable. TP'he first allienations .of
the Imperial revenue were made in this country.
·The Italian cities having acquired wealth, and
aspiring at independence, purchas~ed their liberty
"from different Ermperors, as I have obfrerved Note
·XV. The sums which they paid, and the Erm-
perors with whom they c~oncluded these barg~ains:,
are mentioned by Cafp. Klockins de 1Erario No-

is given by K~lockius de 1Erario, p. 84. Besides
this, the Emperors poff~effed- consider~able diffrias
of land lying intermixed with the estates of the
D·ukes and barons. They were accuffomed to vifiit
these frequently , and drew from ·them what' was
fuffi~cient to suppor~t their court during the time of
·their residence. Annaliftee. ap. Stray. tom. i. 6 r .
.A great part of these were. seized by the nobles
.during the long interregnum, or during the wars
occalloned$ by the contests between the Emperors
:and't-he court of REomae. At the fame time that

.profuse and inconsiderate ambition of Charles IV.
s.quandered w~hatever remained of the. Imperial re-

.chufe his son ~Wenceslaus K~ing of the Romans,
promised each of them a hundlred thousand crowns.
But being unable to pay so large a fum , and eager
to secure the eledtion to his sori, he alienated to
~the three ecclefiaffical; Eledorss, and to th~e Count

falatine, such coimtries as filil belonged to the
~I ien'al doinain on the b~ankcs ofT thle Rhne, andl

were thus alienated, and represent this as the last;
slnd fatal blow to the Imperial authority. Stray.

2. THE ancient mrode of eleain~g the Empe4

iors, andl theP various; chang-es~Fwhich it: underwent,

require s~ome illufiration. T~he Imperial crown
was originally attained by eledtion , as well as
those of most monarchies in Europe. An opinion
long prevailed among the antiquaries and publicki
lawyers of Germany, that the right of chuf~ing the
Emperors was vested in the archbifhops of Mdeneti,
C6ologne, andi Treves, the King of Bohemia, the
iDuke of Saxonyi, the Marquis of Br~andenburgh,
and th-e Count Palatine of the Rhine, by an ediA
of Otho III. confirmed by Gregory V. about the
year 996. . But the whole tenor of hiffory contra.
dias this opinion. It appears, that from the ear·
lieft period in the hiss ory of Germany , the person
wrho was to reign over all, was eledted by the fCuf·
fr-age of all. Thus Conrad I. was eledted by all
the people of the Franks, fay s~ome annalifts; by
all the princes and chief men , fay others; by all
the nation , fay others. See their words , Struv.

Acroamata Sex. Ebroduni, 1654. p.- 103. In the
year r024, pofferior to the s~uppos~ed regulations
of Otho III. Conrad II. was ·eledted by all the
chief men , and his eleation was approved and con·
firmed by the people, Struv. Corp. 284t. At the
leleion of Lotharius II. A. D. 125 , iixty thou-
fgod persons of all rankts were present. He was
.named by the chief men , and their nomination was
approved by the p!eople. Stray. ibid. ·p. 357. The
firfCt aiithor who ·Cnentions th~e, seven Eledfors is

: I~ l artinus Polonus, who flourished in the reign of

IFrederick II. which ended A. D. I250. W7e find
that in all the ancienit ele~aions to which I[ have

·eferred / the Princes of the greateft' power and
tuthiority were allowed by their countrymen to
pame the person whom they withed to appoint
Emperor, and the people approved or dis~approved
of their nomination. This privilege of voting firlt;
is called by the German lawyers the right of Prle
taxaztion. Pfeffel .AbrtgC, p. 316. This was the
first origin of the exclusive right which the Elec=-
tors acqu~ired. T'he Eledors poffeffed the most
extensive t~erritories of any Princes in the Empire;
all the great offices of the Ra~te were in their hanlds
by hereditary right; as soon as they obtained or en-
grossed so much influence in the eledion as to be
allowed the right of praetaxation, it became un-
necessary for the inferior ecclefianitcks and barons
to attend, when they had no other fundtion but
that of confirming the deed of those more powerful
Princes by their assent. During times of turbu-
lence, they could not resort to the place of eledion
without a numeroris retinue of armed vassals, the
expence of which they were'. obliged to defray out
of their own revenues. The rights of the seven
Eledtors were supported by all the des~cendants and
allies of their powerful families, who flhared in the
splendour and influence which they enjoyed by this
diftin~guilhin g privile ge. Pfeffel Abrig6 , p. 376.
The seven E~ledors were confxdered as the- repre-
fentatives of all the orders which composed the
ihigheft class of German nobilifty. T`here were three
archbilhops, chancellors of the three great difrriAs
into which the lEmpire.was anciently divided j one
Kiing; one' Duke s one IMarquis; and one Count.

All1 therie circ~umfiances contributedl to render the
introdudion of this considerable innovation ilif
the conflitution of the Germanick body extremelf
easy. Every thing of importance, relating to thii
-branch of the political slate of, the Emp~ire,. is well
illuffrated by Onuphrius Panvinius, an Augufiti
nian Monk of Verona, who lived in the reignr of
Charles V. ~His treatis~e, if we make some allow.
ance for that partiality which. he expreffews in favour
-of the powers which. the ]Popes claimed in, the
]Empire, has the merit of being one of the firlQ
works in which a controverted point in hiffory n

hifforians. I lt is inserted by Goldaftusin his~olit

As the JEledors have engrossed the sole righ)

oE chuling the ]Emperors, thejr have affune~d like;
wvife that ofdepofing them. This high power- thi
Eledors have not only prefumaed to claim, .but
have ventured, in more than one instance, to exef1
cife. In the year I298 , a part of the Eledo'r
deposed APdolphus of Naffatu and s~ubstituted Alber't
of Auffria in his place. The reasons on which
they found their sentence , show that this deed
~flowed from fam~tous, not frogm publick-fpiritedl
motives. Stray. Corp. vol. i. 640. In the fid)t
year of the fifteenth century, the Elediors deposed
W~enceslaus, and placed the Imifetiar' 'crirn:owi!
the head of RCupert,~EledSor Palatine. The aat oi

deposition is still extant. Goldaiti Conitit. vol. i.
379. It is pronounced in the name and by the
inthority of the Eledtors , and confirmed by several
prelates and barons of the Empire , who hivere
present. There exertions of the eledtoral power
dernonfirate that the Imperial authority wa~s funlk
very low.

T~HE other privileges of the Eledfors, and the

rights of the eledtoral college, are explainied by the
writers on the publick law in Germany.

3. WrrnT refped t~o the diets or general af~em~-

blies of ·the Empire, it would be necef fary , if rny
objea2 were to write a particular h~ilory of Ge~--
mgtny, to enter into a minute detail, concerning
the f~orms- of' assembling it, the persons- who have
a right to be p'ref~ent , their diviflon into s~everal Col.
leges or Benches , the objeats of their deliberation,
the mode in which they carry on their debates or
give their fuffrages, and the authority of their
de~cre~es or recesses. But irk a general hiffory it is
fufficient to obs~erve, that, originally, the diets of
.th~e Empire were: exadtly the fame with the
allemblies of I4.arch and of Mlay , held byi the
Kings ofFrance. They met, at leaflt once ayear.
Every freeman had a right to be present. T~hey
were assemblies, in wYhich a monarch deliberated
with. his fubjets , concerning their common in-
terest. ~Arurnaus de Comitiis R~om. Ge~rman. Im.
perii, 4to, Jens, 1660, cap. 7. N*J. zo, &c. But
when the Princes , d~igniFied ecclefiafticks, aa4 bap

rons acquired territorial and independent jurif.
di~ion, the diet became an ass~embly of~ the separate
slates, which: formed the confederacy of which
the Emperor was head. W~hile the conflitution
of the Empire remained in its primitive form,
attendance on the diets was a duty, like the other
-services due from feudal f~ubjeats to their fove-
reign, which the members were bound to perform
in person; and if any member who had a right
to be present in the diet negleAed to attend in
person, he not only loft his vote, but was liable
to an heavy penalty. Artimsus de Comit, c. 5.
N". 40. Wihereas,.from the time that the mem-
bers of the diet became independent Rtates, the
right of fiuffrage was annexed to the territory or
dtignity, not to the person. TThe members, if t~hey
could not, or would nit attend in person,- might
fend their deputies, as Princes fend ambaffadgors,
and they were ~entitled to exercise all the rights
.belonging to 'their constituents. 1bid. Na.42.46.
49.· By degrees, and upon the fame principle of
considering the diet as an assembly 0f ind~ependent
fCtates, in which each confederate had the right~of
fuffrage, if any member poffeffed more than one
of those Rtates or charad5ters which entitle to a feat
in th~e diet, he was allowed a proportional number
of fuffrages. Pfeffel AbrigC, 622. From the
fame cause the Imperial cities, as soon as they
became free, and acquired supreme and indepen-
dent jurif~diation within their own territories, were
received- as members of the diet. The powers of
the diet extend to eve~r thing relative to the conrn

mon concern of the Germanicke body, or that: cmli
interest or affed it as a, confederacy.. T~he diet
:takes, no cognizance of the interiogs adm~inistration
in, the different Rtates, unless that happens 'to
disturb or threaten the general safety.

4.~ T6VrraI ref~pedt to .the Imperial chamber, the

Sjurifdiation of w'hich has been the great source of
order and tranquillity.in Germany, it is neceff~aryr
to o~bserve, that this couirt was instituted in order
to put an~ end to the calamities occafoioed by
priv~ate. wars in Germanyr. I have already traced
the "rife and progres~s of this prad~icce, and pointed
outi its pernicious effeats as fully as their extensive
;influence during the middle ages merited. In
G~ermany, private wars seem to have been miore
frequent and prodSuaive. of.worfe confeiquences
than in, the other countries of Europe. T~here are
.obvious reas~ons for this. TIhe nobility of Ger-
many wrere extremely numerou~Ls, andi the causes
los their diffenflon multiplied.in proportion. T~he
·t~erritorial juri~fdicaion which the German nobles
acquiired, was more complete than that poffeffeh
iby their order in other nations. · T~hey becamne, in
~reality*, independent powers, and they claimed all
rthe privileges of that ch~arader. TPhe long Inter-
regnum froim A. D9. I255 to A. D9. lz273, accuf-i~
:tomed them to an uncontrouled licence, and led
them to forget that ~fabordination which is ne-
ceffary in order to maintain publick tranquillity.

of· this pradtice, the publick tribunals of juffice ,
became, in a great measure, ufelet~s, and were
almost entirely defCerted.

IN order to re-establish the auth~ority of: govern-

xnent, IVl~aximzilian inflituted the Imperial chamber,
at -the period which I have mentioned. This tri-
bunal consisted originally of a president, who was
always a nobleman of the firRt order, and of fixieen
judges. The president was appointed by the Ern-
peror,, and the judges, partly by him, and partly
by the, States, according to forms which it is un-
necessary to deferibe. A fumn was imposed, with
their own tdonfent, on the States of the Empire,
for paying the salaries of the judges,· and officers
in this court. The Imperial chamber was ei~a-
bl~ife~d firftP at Francfore on the - Maine. During
the reign'of Charles V. it was removed to Spires,
and continued in that city _above a century ~and a
half. It "is nowi fixed at WVetzlar. T~his court

Sconne~ed with .the pres~ervation of the publick

ALL rcauf'es relating to points of feudal right of4

jurifdiaion, together with such as refped5 the terri.
tories wthich hold of the Empire in Iltaly, belong
properly to. the jurifd~iaion of the Ab~lick co~imcil.
T'his tribunal was formed upon the m~odel of thb
ancient court of the palace instituted by the Em-
perors of Germany. It depended not upon the
Sitates of the Empire, but upon the Emperor; -he
having the right of appointinlg at plealkire all thi

order to procure· some compensa~tion- for the dimit

a great objeat of policy in the court of VTienna to

THE -Author ·of Obs~erva~tions on the religion,

m~ade ~som~e rema~rks o~ ~what: is contained in t~his

N~ote,· and that part of the text: to which it re-
~fers. It is with diffidence .I set my opinion in
opposition to that: of a person, who has ob'e-rved,
the government of the Turks with? attention,
a~nd has defecribed it wit~habilities. ~But~ after a
careful review of the f~ubjedt, to me the TSurkiflh
government itill appears of; fuLch a fpgecjes,~ as
canl be ranged in no cl~ass , but that to which
political writers have given the n~me of defio-
tifm. There is not in Turkey anly coaftitutional
reffraint upon the will of the sovereign, or any
barri~er· to circumscribe the exercise~ of his power,
but the two which I have mentionsed, o~ne.af-
~forded by re~ligEion, the princ-ple uppon which the
authority of the Sultan is f~ounded; the other
by the army, the infirument which; he must emn-
ploy to maintain his power. Th~e Author re-
presents the Uklma, or body. of the l~aw, ~as, an in-

authority of the Ulcma may impoe u~pon, the so-

of the law must be chole~n, are e~cclefaiaticks. It
is as interpreters of the Kioran or Divin\e 'Win8
that they are obje~ts of veneratiori. T~fhe check,
then , which they .give to the exescife of arbi-

cannot be very considerable. The· Multi, who

THE Author seems to. confider the CapiculyF,

or soldiery of the Porte , neither as formidable
infiruments oif the Sultan's powier , nor as any re-
firaint upon the exercif~ie of it. His reasons for·
this opinion are , that thbe number of the Capi-
cuily is small in proportion to the other, troops
wThich~ compose the Tu~rkilh amiess and .that in
time of peace they are 'undifciplined. Prefi. ad

SOLYMAN the Mbagnificent, to whom the T~Purkiflh

historians hatve given the firname! of Canuni, ori
institutor of rules, firlt brought the finances and
military eitablifhipent of the Turklh~ Empire into
a regular form. He divided thle military force
into the Capiculy or soldiery of the Porte, which
was properly the flanding army, and Serratacul~y
or soldiers appointed to guard the fr-ontiers. The
chief iRrength of the latter confilted of those- who
held Timariots and Ziams., There were portions
of land granted to certain pers~ons for life, in
mulch the fame manner as the military fiefs among
the riati'ons of Europe, in return for which mili-
tary service was perfoirmed. Solyrnan , in his
Canun-Namc' or book. of regulations, fixed with

g-reat accuracy the extent of these lands in each
province of his Empire, appointed .the: pr~ecise
number of s~oldiers, each pers~on who` held a Tima-
jrioe or a. Ziam thould bring into the fieldi and
eftablith~ed the· pay which ther thould receive whlile
engaged in service. Count Marfigli and Sir: Paul
Rycaut have given _extracts from this book' of re.
gulations; and it appears, that the ordinary efta-
blifmment of the -Turkilh army exceeded an hun-
dredf and fifty thousand men. W~hen these were
added to the s~oldiery; of the Por~te, th~ey formed
a. military power greatly sup~erior to wvhat~any

~and cornmeyrce during the middle ag~es, as wcell as
in my delineations of the political conflitution of

·ordinary man,' whose genius, no less enterprizing
'than universal, has attempted almost every different
Species of literary composition. In many of there
`he excels. In all, if he had left religion untouched,
he is infirudiv~e and agreeable. B~ut as he deldom
`imitates the example of modiern hiss orians in citing
the authors from whom they derived their infor-

prationl, I could not,: with propriety, appeal. to his
inthority in confirmaltion of any doubtful or un.
hitiwn fadt. I ha~ve often, hovueve~r, followed him
as my guide in' ther~e researches;- and he has. not
only pointed out the~ fadts with refp~ed to" which it
wvas of impprtaince to iniquire, but the conclulions
which it was proper to draw from them. If he
ha~d, at. the fame time, mentioned' the books which
relate- there particulars, -a great part of my la-
bour would have been unnecessary, and many ,of
his readers, who now confider him~ only as lan els-
~tertaining and lively writer, would find· that he 'is

readers, such a detail appeared to me, to be les~s

as were necessary towards completing my design in
this part of the work, I have mentioned under the
,different articlePs which are the fubjec?s of my dif-
quif~itins. T,hey slate of government, in all the
nations of Europe, h-taving be-en~ nearly. the fame
during fegral ages, nothing can tend xnore to illuS

trat~e the progress of the English conflitution, than
a careful inquiry ~into the laws and cust~oms of the
]kingdoms on the Continent. This source of in-
formation has -been too much negledfeled by the
English antiquaries and lawyers. F~il~led with ad-
miration of that happy confhtitution now est~ablished
in Great Britain, they have been more attentive to
its forms and principles, than to the condition
and ideas of remote times, which, in almost every
particular, differ froni the present. While engaged
in peruling the laws, charters and early historians
of the continental kingdoms, I have often been led
to think that an attempt to illuffrate the progress
of the English jurisprudence and policy, by a com-
parison with tho~e: of other k~ingdoms in a similar
lituation, would be of great utility, and mig~ht:
throw much light on s~ome points which are now
obscure, and decide others, which have been long
controverted.
