so ardent and vigorous, that large fortunes were

pursuit of discoveries merely poflible, the faintest

and the flightef information was sufficient to in-

s3-. of those adventurers did not extend beyond the

limits of the province to which the Spaniards have
given the name of Tierra Firme , a rhountainous
region covered with woods, thinly inhabited, and
extremely unhealthy, they returned with difnal
accounts concerning the distresses to which they
had been exposed , and the unpromising afpe of
the places which they had visited. Damped by
these tidings , the rage for discovery in that direc-
tion abated; and it became the general opinion,
that Balboa had founded visionary hopes, on the
tale of an ignorant Indian, ill underltood, or cal-
culated to deceive.

uLdert.ken But there were three persons fettled in Panama,
by fizarro, on whom the circumtances which deterred others

152 ement when all confidered Balboa's expectations of

discovering a rich country, by fleering towards
the ealt, as chimerical, they resolved to attempt
the execution of his scheme. The names of those
extraordinary men were Francisco Pizarro, Diego
de Almagro, and Hernando Luque. Pizarro was
the natural son of a gentleman of an hondrable
family by a very low woman, and, according to
the cruel fate which often attends the offspring of
unlawful love , had been so totally negletded in his
youth by the author of his birth, tat he seems
to have detined him never to rife beyond the

condition of his mother. In consequence of this un- B o o K
generous idea, he set him , when bordering on man- vi.
hood, to keep hogs. But the aspiring mind of 1524.
young Pizarro disdaining that ignoble occupation,
he abruptiy abandoned his charge, enlilted as a
soldier, and, after serving some years in Italy, err
barked for America, which, by opening such a
boundless range to ative talents, allured( every
adventurer whose fortune was not equal to his
ambitious thoughts. There Pizarro early distinguish-
ed himself. With a temper of mind no less daring
than the constitution of his body was robust, he
was foremolt in every danger, patient under the
greatest hardships, and ufubdued by any fatigue.
Though so illiterate that he could not even read,
he was soon confidered as a man formed to com-
mand. Every operation committed to his conduct
proved fuccef;ful, as, by a happy but rare con-
junction, he united perseverance with, ardor, and
was as cautious in executing, as he was bold in
forming his plans. By engaging early in ative 1
life, without any resource but his own talents
and industry, and by depending on himself alone
in his struggles to emerge from obscurity, he ac-
quired such a thorough knowledge of affairs, and
of men , that he was fitted to assume a superior part
in conluing the former, and in governing the
latter '.

Almagro had as little to boast of his descent

o o as Pizarro. The one was a baflard, the other a
vi. foundling. Bred, like his companion, in the
14. camp, he yielded not to him in any of the

soldierly qualities, of intrepid valor, indefatigable
.a2ivity, or ifurmountable conflancy in enduring
the hardflhips inseparable from military service in
thle New World.'. .ut in Almagro these virtues
were accompanied with the openness, generosity,
and candor, natural to men wofe profellion is
arms; in Pizarro, they were united with the ad-
dress , the craft, and the diflimulation of a politi-
cian, with the art of concealing his own pur-
poses, and with sagacity to penetrate into those
.of other men.

Hernando de Luque was an ecclefiaflic, who

aeted both as priest and fchoolmatter at Panama,
and, by means which the contemporary writers
have not described, had amafetd riches that in-
spired him with thoughts of rising to greater emi-

nence.

Terms o Such were the men deflined to overturn one of
their affoi. the rnot extensive empires on the face of the
acion,

earth. Their confederacy for this purpose was
authorized by Pedrarias, the governor of Panama.
Fach engaged to employ his whole fortune in the
adventure. Pizarro, the leafl wealthy of the
three, as he could not throw so large a fum as
his afToci;:tes into the common flock, engaged to
take the department of greatelt fatigue and (langer,
and to command i person the armament which was
to go first upon discovery. Alinagro offered to con-
duct the supplies of provisions and reinforcements

of troops, of which Pizarro might stand in need. B o o I
Luque was to remain at Panama to negociate with vi.
the governor, and superintend whatever was carry- 1524.
ing on for the general interest. As the spirit of
cnthufiafm uniformly accompanied that of ad-
venture in the New World, and by that firange
union both acquired an increase of force, this con-
federacy, formed by ambition and avarice, was
confirmed by the most solemn at of religion.
Luque celebrated mass, divided a consecrated host
into three, and reserving one part for himself, gave
the other two to his associates, of which they par-
took; and thus, in name of the Prince of Peace,
ritified a contradt of which plunder and bloodlhed
were the objets '.

ed to the humble condition of the three associates,
than to the greatness of the enterprise in which they
were engaged. Pizarro set fail from Panama with Nov. 14,
a single vessel, of small burden, and a hundred
and twelve men. But in that age, so little were
the Spaniards acquainted with the peculiarities ot
climate in America, that the time which Pizarro
chose for his departure was the most improper in
the whole year; the periodical winds, which were
then set in, being directly adverse to the course
which he purposed to fleer '. After beating about I*Â¶.
for seventy days, with much danger and incefTant
fatigue, Pizarro's progress towards the fouth-ealt

o o was not greater than what a fkilfu! navigator will
vi. now make in as many hours. He touched at fe-
Iss. vcral places on the coast of Tierra Firme, but

found every where the fame uninviting country
which former adventurers had described; the low
grounds converted into swamps by the overflowing
of rivers; the higher, covered with impervious
wood ; few inhabitants, and those fierce and hof-
tile. F:namine, fatigue, frequent rencounters with
the natives, and above all, the distempers of a
moist, flctry climate, combined in waing his

Attenled slender band of followers. The undaunted refo-
with little
fucctcf ]ution of their leader continued, however,for for me

time, to sustain their spirits, although no sign had
yet appeared of discovering those golden regions
to which he had promised to conduct them. At
length he was obliged to abandon that inhofpi-
table coaSt, and retire to Chuchama, opposite to
the pearl-iflands , where he hoped to receive a sup-
plv of provisions and troops fiom Panama.

But Almagro having failed from that port with

seventy men, stood directly towards that part of
the continent where he hoped to meet with his
associate. Not finding him there, he landed his
soldiers, who, in fcarching for their companions,
underwent the fame ditireffis , and were exposed to
the fame dangers, which had driven them out of the
country. Kepulfed at length by the Indians in a
fllarp conflict, inl which their leader loft one of his
eyes by the wound of an arrow, they ]ikewife were
compelled to rcinbark. Chance led them to he
place of Pizarro's retreat, where they found some

consolation in recounting to each other their ad- o o t
ventures, and comparing their sufferings. As Al- vi.
inagro had advanced as far as the river St. Juan ,
in the province of Popyan , where both the coun-
try and inhabitants appeared with a more pro-
mifing afpeet, that dawn of better fortune was sus-
ficicnt to determine inch sanguine projectors not to
abandon their fchcme , notwith flanding all that they
had suffered in prosecuting it '

as this reinforcement was, they did not hesitate
about resuming their operations. After a long

to those which they had already experienced, part
of the armament reached the Bay of St. Matthew,
on the coast of Quito, and lanling at Tacamez,
to the south of the river of Lmeraulds , they beheld
a country more champaign and fertile than any

I o o , Tacamez, and by the fond imagination of those

a handful of men enfeebled by fatigue and diseases.
They retired to the small island of Gallo, where
rizarro remained with part of the troops, and his
associate returned to Panama, in hopes of bringing
such a reinforcement as might enable them to take
possession of the opulent territories, whose existence
seemed to be no longer doubtful '.

Pizarro re- But some of the adventurers, less enterprising,
ovleIor of or less hardy than their leaders, having secretly
anama. conveyed lamentable accounts of their sufferings

and lofTes to their friends at Panama, Almagro met
with an unfavorable reception from Pedro de los
Rios, who had ficceeded Pedrarias in the govern-
ment of that settlement. After weighing the mat-
ter with that cold ceconomical prudence which ap-
pears the first of all virtues to persons whose limit-
ed faculties are incapable of conceiving or execut-
ing great designs, he concluded an expedition, at-
tended with fucli certain wafle of men, to be so
detrimental to an infant and feeble colony, that he
not only prohibited the raising of new levies , but
dispatched a veffcl to bring home Pizarro and his
companions from the island of Gallo. Almagro
and Luque, though deeply affected with those
rneafures, which they could not prevent, and durlt
not oppose, found means of communicating their
sentiments privately to Pizarro, and exhorted him

'Xerez, ixS. Herrera, dec. . lib. viii. c. I3.

not to relinquish an enterprise that was the founda- B o o
tion of all thuir hopes, and the only means of re- VI.
efliblifling their reputation and fortune, which I526.
were both on the decline. Pizarro's mind, bent
with inflexible obltinacy on all its purposes , needed
no incentive to persist in the scheme. He per- Perflts in
emptorily refused to obey.the governor of Pana- his design
ma's orders, and employed all his address and
eloquence in persuading his men not to abandon
him. But the incredible calamities to which they
had been exposed were fill so recent in their memo-
ries, and the thoughts of revisiting their families
and friends after a long absence, rushed with fiuch
joy into their minds, that when Pizarro drew a
line upon the sand with his sword, permitting such
as wified to return home to pass over it, only
thirteen of all the daring veterans in his service had
rcfolution to remain with their commander .

This small, but determined band, whose names

the Spanish historians record with deserved praise,
as the persons to wihofe persevering fortitude their
country is indebted for the molt valuable of all its
American poffefions, fixed their residence in the
island of Gorgona. This, as it was farther re-
moved from the coast than Gallo, and uninhabited,
they confidered as a more secure retreat, where,
uilmolclted, they might wait for supplies from
Panama, which they trulted that the activity of their
associates would be able to procure. Almagro and

B o o i Luque were not inattentive or cold solicitors, and

VT their incetltnt importunity was fcconded by the
xÂ¶ 6. s:enral voice of the colony, which exclaimed

lioudly against the infamy of exposing brave men,
engaged in the public fcrvicc, and chargeable
with no error but what flowed from an exccfs of
zeal and courage, to perish like the most odious
criminals in a desert island. Overcome by those
intreaties and expostulations , the governor at last
consented to fend a finall vessel to their relief. But
that he might not seem to encourage Pizarro to
any new enterprise, he would not permit one
landman to embark on board of it.

Hardshipshe By this time, Pizarro and his companions had
endured, remained five months in an island, infamous for

the most unhealthy climate in that region of Ame-
rica'Â°. During all this period, their eyes were
turned towards Panama, in hopes of succour from
their countrymen; but worn out at length with
fruitless expedtations, and dispirited with suffering
liardfhips of which they saw no end, they, in de-
fpair, came to a rcfolution of committing them-
selves to the ocean on a float, rather than continue
in that detestable abode. But, on the arrival of
the velfel from Panama, they were tranfl)olrted with
fich joy, that all their filfferings were forgotten.
Their hopes revived , and, with a rapid transition ,
not unnatura-l among men accufllomd by their
mode of life to fuidden vicinitutles of fortune,
hligh confidence succeeding to extreme dejection,

Â° Sec NOTE IlL

Pizarro easily induced not only his own followers, o o K
but the crew of the vessel from Panama, to resume VI.
his former scheme with fresh ardor. Instead of return- ,is6.
ing to Panama, they flood towards the south east,
and more fortunate in this than in any of their pall
efforts, they, on the twentieth day after their de-
parture from Gorgona, discovered. the coast of
Peru. After touching at several villages on the Dircovers
coast no wife inviting, they landed at Tumbez, a Peru.
place of some note, about three degrees south of
the line, diflinguifhed for its stately temple, and a
palace of the Incas or sovereigns of the country ".
There the Spaniards feasted their eyes with the first
view of the opulence and civilization of the Peru-
vian empire. They beheld a country fully peopled,
and cultivated with an appearance of regular in-
duftry; the natives decently clothed, and possessed
of ingenuity so far surpassing the other inhabitants,
of the New World, as to have the use of tame do-
mcrfic animals. But what chiefly attracted their
notice, was such a flow of gold and silver, not
only in the ornaments of their persons and temples
but in fevcral vessels and utensils for common use,
formed of those precious metals, as left no room
to doubt that they abounded with profusion in
the country. Pizarro and his companions seem-
ed now to have attained to the completion of their
molt sanguine hopes, and fancied that all their
wifles and dreams of rich domains, and inexhaUft-
ible treafurcs, would soon be realized.

Panamla. ranged, however, for some time along the coast,

maintaining every where a peaceable intercourse
with the natives, no less astonished at their new
visitants, than the Spaniards were with the uniform
appearance of opulence and cultivation which they
beheld. Having explored the country as far as
was requiite to ascertain the importance of the dif-
covery, Pizarro procured from the inhabitants some
of their Llamas or tame cattle, to which the Spa-
niards gave the name of Iheep, some vessels of gold
and silver, as well as fom specimens of their other
works of ingenuity, and two young men, whom
he proposed to infirud in the Castilian language,
that they might serve as interpreters in the expe-
dition which he meditated. With these he arrived
at Panama, towards the close of the third year from
the time of his departure thence ". No adventurer
of the age suffered hardships or encountered dan-
gers which equal those to which he was exposed
during this long period. The patience with which
lie endured the one, and the fortitude with which
he surmounted the other, exceed whatever is re-
corded in the history of the New World, where
so many romantic displays of those virtues occur.

had discovered, nor his bitter complaints on ac- vi.
count of that unseasonable recal of his forces,which 'e28

had put it out of his power to attempt making any ichemes
settlement there, could move the governor of Pa- oftheaffr.
nama to swerve from his former purpose. He fill cte
contended, that the colony was not in a condition
to invade such a mighty empire, and refused to
authorize an expedition which he foresaw would be
so alluring that it might ruin the province in which
he presided, by an effort beyond its strength. His
coldness, however, (lid not in any degree abate the
ardor of the three associates; but they perceived
that they could not carry their scheme into execu-
tion without the countenance offuperior authority,
and must solicit their sovereign to grant that per-
mission which they could not extort from his dele,
gate. With this view, after adjufRing among
themselves that Pizarro should claim the station of
governor, Almagro that of lieutenant-governor,
and Luque the dignity of bishop in the country
which they purposed to conquer, they sent Pizarro
as their agent to Spain, though their fortunes were
now so much exhausted by the repeated efforts
which they had made, that they found some diffi-
culty in borrowing the finall fum requisite towards

B o o a man conscious of what his services merited; atd

vi. he conduded his negociations with an insinuating
isss. dexterity of address, which could not have been

expected either from his education or former ha-
bits of life. His feeling description f his own sus-
ferings, and his pompous account of the country
which he had discovered , confirmed by the fpeci-
mens of its productions which he exhibited , made
such an imprclfion both on Charles and his minis-
tcrs, that they not only approved of the intended
expedition, but seemed to be interested in the fuc-
cess of its leader. Presuming on those dispositions
in his favor, Pizarro pid little attention to the

Neglefahis interest of his associates. As the pretensions of
aflboiates, Luque did not interfere with his own, he obtained

for him the ecclesiastical dignity to which he afpir-
ed. For Almagro, he claimed only the command
of the fortress which should be creted at Tumbez.
To himself he secured whatever his boundlcfs am-

July 2=. bition could desire. He was appointed governor,
and procures captain-general, and adelantado of all the country

two hundred leagues along the coast to the fonth
of the river St. Jago; to be independent of the
governor of Panama; an(d he had power to nomni-
nate all the officers who were to frve under him.
In return for those conceflions, which colt the court

the number; and after obtaining his patents from
the crown, he was obliged to feal privately out of
the port of Seville, in order to elude the scrutiny
of the officers who had it in charge to examine,
whether he had fulfilled the stipulations in his con.
tradt +. Before his departure , however, he received
some supply of money from Cortes, who having
returned to Spain about this time, was willing to
contribute his aid towards enabling an ancient com-
panion, with whose talents and courage he was well
acquainted, to begin a career of glory similar to
that which he himself had finifled 'I.

He landed at Nombre de Dios, and marchgd

three brothers, Ferdinand, Juan, and Gonzalo, of
whom the firfl was born in lawful wedlock, the two
latter, like himself, were of illegitimate birth, ani
by Francisco de Alcantara, his mother's brother.
They were all in the prime of life, and offuch abi-
lities and courage, as fitted them to take a diftin
guifled part in his subsequent tranfadcions.

voluntarily to relinquish the office of adelantado,
and promising to concur in soliciting that title

gradually mitigated the rage of an open-heartec

of the Spaniards in America had inspired them with o o si
fich ideas of their own fperiority, that Pizarro vr.
did not hesitate to fail with this contemptible force fml
to invade a great empire. Almagro was left at F'"bruary

from the sea-shore, both that he might easily effedc

But as the country in several parts on the coast
of Peru is barren, unhealthful and thinly peopled;
as the Spaniards had to pass all the rivers near

propriety; and without a suitable attention to
them, it is impofllble to account for the progress
which the Spaniards had already made, or to
unfold the causes of their subsequent success.

State of the At the time when the Spaniards invaded Peru,
Peruvian the dominions of its sovereigns extended in length,

from north to south, above fifteen hundred miles
along the Pacific Ocean. Its breadth, from east to
weft, was much less considerable; being uniformly
bounded by the vast ridge of the Andes, firetching
from its one extremity to the pther. Peru, like the
reft of the New World, was originally possessed
by small independent tribes, differing from each
other in manners, and in their forms of rude
policy. All, however, were so little civilized, that,
if the traditions concerning their mode of life,
preserved among their descendants, deserve credit,
they must be classed among the most unimproved
savages of America. Strangers to every species of
cultivation or regular indultry, without any fixed
residence, and unacquainted with those sentiments
and obligations which form the first bonds of social
union, they are said to have roamed about naked
in the forests, with which the country was then
covered, more like wild beasts than like men.
After they had struggled for several ages with the
hardfliips and calamities which arc inevitable in
such a fate, and when no circumstance seemcd
to indicate the approach of any uncommon effort

towards improvement, we are told that there i o o
appeared on the banks of the lake Titiaca, a man v.
and woman of majeltic form, and clothed in 5s3.
decent garments. They declared themselves to be
children of the Sun, sent by their beneficent
parent, who beheld with pity the miseries of the
human race, to inftrud and to reclaim them. At
their persuasion, enforced by reverence for the
divinity in whose name they were supposed to
speak, several of the dispersed savages united toge-
ther, and receiving their commands as heavenly
injunctions, followed them to Cuzco, where they
fettled, and began to lay the foundations of a
city.

Manco Capac and Mama Ocollo, for such were

the names of those extraordinary personages, having
thus collected some wandering tribes, formed that
social union, which, by multiplying the desires,
and uniting the efforts of the human species, excites
industry, and leads to inprovement. Nlanco Capac
inftruded the men in agriculture, and other useful
arts. Mama Ocollo taught the women to spin and
to weave. By the labor of the one sex, subsistence
became lets precarious; by that of the other, life
was rendered more comfortable. After securing
the objedts of firit neceflity in an infant slate, by
providing food, raiment, and habitations, for the
rude people of whom he took charge, Manco
Capac turned his attention towards introducing
such laws and policy as might perpetuate their
happiness. By his institutions, which fball be

that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions,
but the desire of diffusing the. blefin gs of civiliza-
tion, and the knowledge of the arts which they
poffelfcd, among the barbarous people whom they
reduced. During a fuccefiion of twelve monarchs,
it is said that not one deviated from this beneficent
character ".

Wlhen the Spaniards first visited the coalt of

Peru, in the year one thousand five hundred and(
twenty-fix, Hu,.na Capac, the twelfth monarch
from the founder of the fate, was feated on the
throne. He is represented as a prince distinguished
not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to the
race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his
x'idorious arms the kingdom of Quito was fubjeded,
a conquest of such extent and importance as almolt
doubled the power of the Peruvian empire. He
was fond of residing in the capital of that valuable
province, which he had added to his dominions;
and, notwithlanldiing the ancient and fundamental
law of the monarchy against polluting the royal
blood by any foreign alliance, he married the
daughter of the vanquilhed monarch of Quito.

s o o twenty-nine, he ap)ointed his ficceffor in that

vr. kingdom, leaxving the reft of his dominions to
1s34I. -tulfcar, his eldest fnn by a mother of the royal

race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory
of a monarch who had reigned with greater repu-
tation and splendor than any of his predecessors,
the deltination of Huana Capac concerning the
fuiLeffion, appeared so repugnant to a maxim
coeval with the empire, and founded on authority
deemed sacred, that it was no sooner known at
Cuzco than it excited general disgust. Encouraged
by th:ife sentiments of his fuibjedts, Huafcar required
Li brother to renounce the government of Quito,
and to acknowledge him as his lawful fperior.
But it had been the firfI care of Atahualpa to
gain a large body of troops wlich had accompanied
hi ftiaher to Quito. Thef' were the flower of the
Peruvian varri r , to whose valor Iuana Capac
had been indebted for all his victories. Kelying on
their fpport, Atahualpa first eluded his brother's
demand, and then mrched against him in hostile
array.

'Thus the ambition of two young men, the title

of the one founded on ancient usage, and that of
the other afTerted by the veteran troops, involved
Pelu in civil war, a calamity to which, under a
succession of virtnous princes, it had hitherto been
a stranger. In such a cont, ft the issue was obvious.
The force of arms triumphed over the authority of
laws. Atahualpa remained vidtorious, and made a
cruel ufc of his vidory. Confclous of the defect
in his own title tQ the crown, he attempted to

exterminate the royal race, by putting to death B o o t
all the children of the Sun descended from Manco vi.
Capac, whom he could seize either by force or I('.
firatagem. From a political motive, the life of his
unfortunate rival Iltafcar, who had been taken
prisoner in the battle which decided the fate of
the empire, wis prolonged for some time, that,
by iffTing orders in his name, the usurper might
more cafily eliabiflh his own authority".

could divert him from opposing his progress. But
at this time, the two competitors, though they
received early accounts of the arrival and violent
proceedings of the Spaniards, were so intent upon
the operations of a war, which they deemed more
interesting, that they paid no attention to the
motions of an enemy, too inconsiderable in number
to excite any great alarm, and to whose career, it
would be easy, as they imagined, to give a check
when more at leisure.

leflted, and advanced to the centre of a great
empire. before one effort of its power was exerted
to stop his career. During their progress, the
Spaniards had acquired sone imperfedc knowledge
of this struggle between the two contending
facdions. The firfi complete information with
refped to it, they received from messengers whoin
Huafcar sent to Pizarro, in order to solicit his aid
againlt Atahualpa, whom he represented as a
rebel and an usurper . Pizarro perceived at once
the importance of this intelligence, and foresaw so
clearly all the advantages which might be derived
from this divided state of the kingdom , which
he had invaded, that, without waiting for the
reinforcement which he expected from Panama, he
determined to push forward, while interline discord
put it out of the power of the Peruvians to attack
him with their whole force, and while, by taking
part, as circumstances fiould icline him , with
one of the competitors, he might be enabled with
greater cafe to crufli both. nterprifing as the

As he was obliged to divide his troops, in Stteufhis

order to leave a garrison in St. Mlichael, sufficient forccS.
to defend a station of equal importance as a place
of retreat in cafe of av difaler, and as a port
for receiving any supplics which fiould come
from Panama, he'began his march with a very
slender and ill.accoutred train of followers. They
confilted of fixty-two herfemen :', and a hundred

armed with cross-bows, and three with muskets.
IHe directed his course towards Caxamalca, a small
town at the distance of twelve days march from
St. MNichael, where Atahualpa was encamped with
a considerable body of troops. Before he had
proceeded far, an officer dispatched by the Inca
met him with a valuable present from that prince,
accompanied with a proffer of his alliance, and
aifturances of a friendly reception at Caxamalca.
Pizarrn, according to the usual artifice of his
countrymen in America, pretended to come as

th'i3d' they should confider their new guests as beings of
their de.
gins. a superior nature, who had visited them from

some beneficent motive, or as formidable avenger;
of their crimes, and enemies to their repose and
liberty. The continual professions of the Spaniards,
that they came to enlighten them with the
knowledge of truth, and lead them in the way
of happiness, favored the former opinion; the
outrages which they committed, their rapaciousness
and cruelty, were awful confirmations of the latter.
While in this slate of uncertainty, Pizarro's declara.
tion of his pacific intentions so far removed all the
Inca's fears, that he determined to give him a
friendly reception, In consequence of this resolution,
the Spaniards were allowed to march in tranquillity
across the sandy desert betw-een St. Michael and
Motupe, where the most feeble effort of an enemy,
added to the unavoidable difireffes which they
suffered in pafifng through that comfortless region,
must have proved fatal to them ". From Motupe
they advanced towards the mountains which en.
compassed the low country of Peru, and passed
through a defile so narrow and iacceffible, that
a few men might have defended it againfl a
numerous army. But here likewise, from the fame
inconsiderate credulity of the ic1ca, the Spaniards
met with no opposition, and took quiet poffellion

sent them presents of greater value than the
former.

On entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took poffeffior Arrive at
f a large court, on one fide of which was a Caxamaici
house which the Spanish hiflorians call a palace
of the Inca, and on 'the other a temple of the
un, the whole surrounded with a strong rampart

his advantageous station, he dispatched Hernando
oto, and his brother Ferdinand, to the camp of
tahualpa, which was about a league diltant
rom the town. He inftruded them to confirm
he declaration which he had formerly made of
is pacific disposition, and to desire an interview
vith the Inca, that he might explain more fully
he intention of the Spaniards in visiting his
ountry. They were treated with all the refpecdful
ofpitality usual among the Peruvians in the recep.
ion of their most cordial friends, and Atahualpa
romifed to visit the Spanifl commander next day

iLhzrrof wvere yet warm with admiration and desire of the

wealth which they had beheld, they gave filch a
dcfeiiption of it to their countrymen, as confirmed
Pizarro in a resolution which he had already taken.
From his own observation of American manners
during his long service in the New World, as
well as from the advantages which Cortes had
derived from seizing IMontezuma, he knew of what
consequence it was to have the Inca in his power.
For this purpose, he formed a plan as daring as
it was perlidious. Notwithftandingi the charater
that he had assumed of an ambassador from a
powerful monarch, who courted an alliance vwth
the Inca, and in violation of the repeated offers
which ihe had made to himn of his own fiiendfip

preparations for this were so tedious, that the day
was far advanced before he began his march.
Even then, left the order of the proceflion should
be deranged, he moved so slowly, that the Spa-
niards became impatient, and apprehensive that
some ffpicion of their intention might be the
cause of this delay. In order to remove this, Pi-
zarro dispatched one of his officers with frcfh affur-
anccs of his friendly disposition. At length the
Inca approached. First of all appeared four hun-
dredn men, in an uniform dress, as harbingers to
clear the way before him. He himself, fitting on
a throne or couch, adorned with plumes of various

incapable of expressing himself with propriety in
the language of the Inca, that its general tenor
was altogether incomprehensible to Atahualpa.
Some parts in it, of more obvious meaning, filled
him with afloniflment and indignation. His re-
ply, however, was temperate. He began with
observing, that he was lord of the dominions over
which he reigned by hereditary succession; and
addled, that he could not conceive how a foreign
priet should pretend to dispose of territories which
did not belong to him; that if fich a preposterous
grant had been made, he, who was the rightful
poffeforr, refused to confirm it; that he had no in-
clination to renounce the religious inltitutions eltab-
lifhed by his ancestors; nor would he forsake the
service of the Sun, the immortal divinity whom he
and his people revered, in order to worlhip the
God of the Spaniards, who was fibjed to death;

discourse, as he had never heard of them before,
and did not now uiderfand their meaning, he de-

with such a reinforcement as would almost double
the number of his followers ". The arrival of this
long-expeded succour was not more agreeable to
the Spaniards, than alarming to the Inca. He saw
the power of his enemies increase; and as he knew
neither the source whence they derived their sup-
plies, nor the means by which they were conveyed
to Peru, he could not soresec to what a height the
inundation that poured in upon his dominions
might rife. While disquieted with such apprehen- 1533.

to Cuzco, had visited his brother Hutafcar in the
placc where he kept him confined, and that the
c;ptive prince had represented to them the justice
of his own cause, and as an inducement to cfpoufe
it, had promised them a quantity of treasure greatly
beyond that which Atahualpa had engaged to pay
or his ransom. If the Spaniards fhonld liften to
lhis proposal, Atahualpa perceivcd his own de-

Iis other commands, with fcrlpnulous pun&uality ".

The Spani- Mleanwhile, Indians daily arrived at Caxamalca
irlsl' oa from dif'rent parts of the kingdom, loaded with
ther flil treasure. A great part of the flipulated quantity

was now armaifed, and Atahualpa assured the Spa-
niards, that the only thing which prevented the
whole from being brought in, was the remote-
ness of the provinces where it was deposited. But
such vaRn piles of gold presented continually to the
view of needy soldiers, had so inflamed their ava-
rice, that it was impossible any longer to restrain
their impatience to obtain polfeflion of this rich
booty. Orders were given for melting down the
whole, except some pieces of curious fabric, re-
served as a present for the emperor. After setting
apart the fifth due to the crown, and a hundred
thousand pesos as a donative to the soldiers which
arrived with Altnagro, there remained one million
five hundred and twenty-eight thousand five hun-
dlred pesos to Pizarro and his followers. 'lhe fcf-

out as a striking feature in the characer of the B o o
conquerors of the New World. Though assem- vi.
bled to divide the spoils of an innocent people, ,533-
procured by deceit, extortion, and cruelty, the
tranfadion began with a solemn invocation of the
name of God , as if they could have expected the
guidance of Heaven il distributing those wages of
iniquity. In this division above eight thousand
pesos, at that time not inferior in cffediive value
to as many pounds Sterling in the present century,
fell to the share of each horseman, and half that
film to each foot-foldier. Pizarro himself, and
his officers, received dividends in proportion to the
dignity of their rank.

There is no example in history of such a sudden The effee

acquisition of wealth by military frvice, nor was Of it
ever a fum so great divided among so small a num-
ber of soldiers. Many of them having received a
recompence for their services far beyond their most
sanguine hopes, were so impatient to retire from
fatigue and danger, in order to spend the remain-

The Inca 'The Spaniards having divided among them the
his liberty treasure amaed for the Inca's ransom , he insisted
in vin. with them to fulfil their promise of setting him at

liberty. But nothing was farther from Pizarro's
thoughts. During his long service in the New
World, he had imbibed those ideas and maxims of
his fellow-foldiers, which led them to confider its
inhabitants as an inferior race, neither worthy of
the name, nor entitled to the rights, of men. In
his compact with Atahualpa, he had no other ob-
jed than to amuse his captive with such a profpcd
of recovering his liberty, as might induce him to
lend all the aid of his authority towards colleding
the wealth of his kingdom. Having now accom-
plifled this, he no longer regarded his plighted
faith; and at the very time when the credulous
prince hoped to be replaced on his throne, he had
secretly resolved to bereave him of life. Many
circumstances seem to have concurred in prompting
him to this action, the most criminal and atrocious
that tains the Spanish name, amidPt all the deeds
of violence committed in carrying on the conquest
of the New World.

temper and address requisite for gaining the cons- B o o T
dence of his prisoner, he never reaped all the ad- vT.
vantages which might have been derived from be- I'3
ing malter of his person and authority. Atahualpa
wv.,s, indeed, a prince of greater abilities and dif-
cernment than Montezuma, and seems to have pe-
netrated more thoroughly into the characer and
intentions of the Spaniards. Mutual suspicion and
(liltruft accordingly took place between then. The
firi attention with which it was necessary to guard
a captive of such importance, greatly increased the
fatigue of military duty. The utility of keeping
him appeared inconsiderable; and Pizarro felt him
as an encumberance, from which he wifled to be
delivered .

Almagro and his followers had made a demand Almaro
of an equal share in the Inca's ransom; and though loers he.
Pizarro had bestowed upon the private men the 1madI hlis
large gratuity which I have mentioned, and en- lie.
deavoured to sooth their leader by presents of great
alue, they still continued dissatisfied. They were
apprehcnfive, that as long as Atahualpa remained
a prisoner, Pizarro's soldiers would apply whatever
trcafire should be acquired to make up what was
\vanting of the quantity flipulated for his ranforn,
and under that pretext exclude them from any part
of it. They insisted eagerly on putting the Inca
to death , that all the adventurers in Peru might
thereafter be on an equal footing'

i o o Pizarro himself began to be alarmed with an ac.

Xv. count of forces affcmbling in the remote provinces
' n'. of the empire, and fufpeded Atahualpa of having

lI1oiveq
,i i,. in- issued orders for that purpose. 'These fears and
.!i.,ic i. filficions were artfully increased by Philippillo,

7.1r onle of the Indians whom Pizarro had carried of
t uiuin t.

from Tumnbez in the year one thousand five hun.
dred and twenty-feven, and whom he employed as
an interpreter. The funfcion which he performed
admitting this man to familiar intercourse with the
captive monarch, he presumed, notwithstanding
the meanness of his birth, to raise his affections to
a Ca, or descendant of the Sun, one of Atahual
pa's wives; and feeing no profpet of gratifying
that pafion during the life of the monarch, he en.
deavoured to fill the ears of the Spaniards with such
accounts of the Inca's secret designs and prepara.
tions , as might awaken their jealousy, and incite
them to cut him off.

manded the life of the Inca, and Philippillo la.
bored to ruin him by private machinations , that
unhappy prince inadvertently contributed to haften

he was always uneasy, and overawed. This dread B o o
soon came to be mingled with contempt. Among all. v.
the European arts, what he admired molt was that 1I33.
of reading and writing ; and he long deliberated
with himself, whether he should regard it as a na-
tural or acquired talent. In order to determine
this, he desired one of the soldiers, who guarded
him to write the name of God on the nail of his
thumb. This he showed fucceffivcly to feverat
Spaniards, alking its meaning; and to his amaze-
ment, they all, without hesitation, returned the
fame answer. At length Pizarro entered; and on
presenting it to him, he bluflled , and with ome
confusion was obliged to acknowledge his igno-
rance. From that moment, Atahualpa confdered
him as a mean person, less inftruded th2n his own
soldiers; and he had not address enough to conceal
the sentiments with which this discovery inspired
lrn. To be the objec of a barbarian's scorn, not
only mortified the pride of Pizarro, but excited
fich rcfentment in his breast, as added force to all
the other considerations which prompted him to
put the Inca to death ".

silt the prisoner in his defence ; and clerks were
ordained to record the proceedings of the court. Be-
fore this strange tribunal, a charge was exhibited
fill more amazing. It confrited of various ar.
ticles; that Atahualpa, though a bastard, had dif.
pofleffcd the rightful owner of the throne, and
usurped the regal power; that he had put his bro-
ther and lawful sovereign to death; that he was
an idolater, and had not only permitted, but
commanded the offering of human sacrifices ; that
lie had a great number of concubines; that since
his imprisonment he had wafted and embezzled the
royal treasures, which now belonged of right to the
conquerors; that he had incited his fbjeds to
take arms against the Spaniards. On these heads
of accusation, some of which are so ludicrous,
others so absurd, that the effrontery of Pizarro, in
making them the foundation of a serious proce-
dure, is not less surprising than his injustice, did
this ftrangc court go on to try the sovereign of a
great empire, over whom it had no jurifdidtion.

of Pizarro. He ordered him to be led instantly
to cxecution; and,. what added to the bitterness
of his aft moments, the fame monk who had just
ratified his doom, offered to con sole, and attempted
to convert him. The most powerful argument
Valverde employed to prevail with him to embrace

torted from the trembling victim a desire of receiv-

which the empire had been thrown, firfl by the B o o
civil war between the two brothers, and then by vi
the invasion of the Spaniards, had not only de- 'l33.
ranged the order of the Peruvian government , but
alrnoft dissolved its frame. When they beheld
their monarch a captive in the power of strangers,
and at last suffering an ignominious death , the
people in several provinces , as if they had been
set free from every restraint of law and decency,
broke out into the molt licentious excesses '4. So
many descendants of the Sun , after being treatedt
with the utmost indignity, had been cut off by
Atahualpa, that not only their influence in the tate
diminished with their number, but the accuflomed
reverence for that sacred race sensibly decreased.
In consequence of this state of things , ambitious
men in different parts of the empire aspired to in-
dependent authority, and usurped a jurifdiion to
which they had no title. The general who com-
manded for Atahualpa in Quito , seized the brother
and children of his master , put them to a cruel
cath, and disclaiming any connexion with either
Inca, endeavoured to ellablill a separate kingdom
or himself 4'.

n o o hesitated to advance towards Cuzco, and he had

vi. received such considerable reinforcements, that he
i;3. could venture, with little danger, to penetrate so

far into the interior part of the country. The
account of the wealth acquired at Caxamalca
operated as he had forereen. No sooner did his
brother Ferdinand, with the officers and foldirs
to whom he had given their discharge after the
partition of the Inca's ransom , arrive at Panama,
and display their riches in the view of their
astonished countrymen, than fame spread the ac-
count with such exaggeration through all the
Spanish settlements on the South-Sea, that the
governors of Guatimala, Panama, and Nicaragua,
could hardly restrain the people under their jurif.
dilion, from abandoning their possessions, and
crowding to that inexhaustible source of wealth
ivhich feemeed to be opened in Peru . In spite of
every check and regulation, such numbers resorted
thither, that Pizarro began his march at the head
of five hundred men , after leaving a considerable
garrison in St. Mlichael, under the command of
Benalcazar. The Peruvians had aflembled ome
large bodies of troops to oppose his progress.
Several fierce encounters happened. But they
terminated like all the actions in America; a fexv
Spaniards were killed or wounded ; the natives
were put to flight with incredible slaughter. At
length Pizarro forced his way to Cuzco, and took

quiet possession of that capital. The riches found o o
there, even after all that the natives had carried off vr.
and concealed, cither from a fuperltitious venera- 533.
tion for the ornaments of their temples, or out of
harred to their rapacious conquerors, exceeded in
value what had been received as Ataliualpa's ran-
fonm. But as the Spaniards were now accufomred
to the wealth of the country, and it came to be
parcelled out aong a greater number of adven-
turers, this dividend did not excite the fame fur-
prise either from novelty , or the largeness of the
fum that f 1 to the share of each individual .

During the march to Cuzco, that son of

Atahualpa whom Pizarro treated as Inca, died;

they met with a cruel mortification there. The

[iftinclion as to serve on horseback. He landed at
lucrto Viejo, and without sufficient knowledge of
the country , or proper guides to conduct him,
attempted to march directly to Quito by follow-
ing the course of the river Guayquil, and crossing
the ridge of the Andes towards its head, But in
this route, one of the most impracticable in all

their way through forefis and marshes on the

iht: of enemies whoin he did not expect, advanced

o o some moderate men in each party, an amicable
vi. accommodation took place , and the fatal period,
t53 . when Spaniards suspended their conquests to em-

brue their hands in the blood of their countrymen,
was postponed a few years. Alvarado engaged to
return to his government, upon Almagro's paying
him a hundred thousand pesos to defray the expense
of;his armament. Most of his followers remained
in the country; and an expedition, which threat.
ened Pizarro and his colony with ruin , contributed
to augmeht its strength +7

onfrredon Spain. The immense quantities of gold and silver

Aiagro. less astonishment than they had excited in Panama

and the adjacent provinces. Pizarro was received
by the emperor with the attention due to the
bearer of a present so rich, as to exceed any idea
which the Spaniards had formed concerning the
value of their acquisitions in America, even after
they had been ten years masters of Mexico. In
recompence of his brother's services, his authority
was confirmed with new powers and privileges,
and the addition of seventy leagues , extending
a.long the coalt, to the southward of the territor
granted in his former patent. Almagro received
the honors which he had so long defred. Tlit
title of Adelantado, or governor, was conferred

mitted into the military order of St. Jago, a dif-
tindion always acceptable to a Spanifr gentleman,

nied by many persons of higher rank than had yet
fcrved in that country '.

Some account of his negociations reached Peru Reginningof

before he arrived there himself. Almagro no dbetlifi, i.
sooner learned that he had obtained the royal grant zarrnand

that Cuzco, the imperial residence of the Incas,

himself master of that important station. Juan
and Gonzalez Pizarro prepared to oppose him.
Each of the contending parties was supported by
powerful adherents, and the dispute was on the
point of being terminated by the sword, whea
Francis Pizarro arrived in the capital. The recon-
ciliation between him and Almagro had never been
cordial. The treachery of Pizarro in engrossing
to himself all the honors and emoluments, which
ought to have been divided with his afociate, was
always present in both their thoughts. The former,
conscious of his own perfidy, (lid not expet for-

X o o K avarice nd ambition had induced them not only

vr. to diffeble their sentiments, but even to ad in
J534. concert while in purfit of wealth and power, no

sooner did they obtain polfeffion of these, than the
fame pffions which had formed this temporary
union, gave rife to jealousy and discord. To each
of them was attached a finall band of interested
dependants, who , with the malicious art peculiar
to such men, heightened their suspicions, and mag.
nified every appearance of offence. But with all
those feeds of enmity in their minds, and thus
assiduously cherished, each was so thoroughly ac.
quainted with the abilities and courage of his rival,
that they equally dreaded the consequences of an
open rupture. The fortunate arrival of Pizarro at
Cuzco, and the address mingled with firmness
which he manifested in his expostulations witl
Almagro and his partisans , averted that evil for
the present. A new reconciliation took place i the
chief article of which was, that Almagro should
attempt the conquest of Chili; and if he did not
find in that province an eftabliflment adequate to
his merit and expectations, Pizarro, by way of in-
demnification , should yield up to him a part of
June i2, Peru. This new agreement, though confirmed with

the fame sacred folemnities as their first contract,
was observed with as little fidelity '.

Spanish or Indian , he applied himself with that zs34.
persevering ardor, which diftinguilhes his cha-
rader, to introduce a form of regular government
into the extensive provinces subjed to his autho-
rity. Though ill qualified by his education to
enter into any disquisition concerning the principles
of civil policy, and little accustomed by his former
habits of life to attend to its arrangements , his
natural sagacity supplied the want both of science
and experience. He distributed the country into
various difrrids ; he appointed proper magistrates
to preside in each; and established regulations con-
cerning the administration of justice, the collecion
of the royal revenue, the working of the mines,
and the treatment of the Indians, extremely simple,
but well calculated to promote the public profpe-
rity. But though, for the present, he adapted his
plan to the infant state of his colony, his aspiring
mind looked forward to its future grandeur. He Pouidation
confidered himself as laying the foundation of a ofLima.
great empire, and deliberated long, and with much
solicitude, in what place he should fix the feat of
government. Cuzco, the imperial city of the
Incas, was situated in a corner of the empire , above
four hundred miles from the tea, and much farther
rolnn Quito, a province of whose value he had
formed a high idea. No other fettlemcnt of the
l'eruvians was so considerable as to merit the name
of a town , or to allure the Spaniards to fix their
residence in it. But, in marching through the

E4

o o r country, Pizarro had been firuck with the beauty
v. and fertility of the valley of Rimac , one of the
1534. most extensive and belt cultivated in Peru. There,

on the banks of a finall river, of the fame name
with the vale which it waters and enriches, at the
diflance of fix miles from Callao, the molt com-
modious harbour in the Iacific Ocean, he founded
a city which he deitined to be the capital of his
government. He gave it the name of Ciudad de
'3. los Reyes , either from the circumstance of having

laid the firl stone , at that season when the church
celebrates the festival of the Three Kings, or, as
is more probable, in honor of Juana and Charles,
thefoverigtls of Caflile. Thil name it ltill retains
among the Spaniards , in all legal and formal
deeds; but it is better known to foreigners by that
of Limla, a corruption of the ancient appellation of
the valley in which it is fituared. Under his in-
fpeion , the buildings advanced with such rapi-
dity, that it soon afuimed the forin of a city, whiclh,
by a magniricent palace that he erecld for himself;
and by the stately hotifes built by several of his
otlicers, gave, even in its inlancy , forme indication
of i.s subsequent grandeur ".

In consequence of what had been agreed with

Almagro in-Pizarro, Almagro began his march tovwards Chili;
vades Chili.

and as he possessed in an eminent degree the virtues
molt admired by soldiers, bouinlef. liberality and
scarless courage , his standard was followed by live

acquired by all the Spaniards who had served
loi) in America, Almagro, instead of advancing
alolng the level country on the coat , chof to
m;rch across the mountains by a route that was
iliorter indeed, but almost impradticable. In this
attemnpt his troops were exposed to every calamity
vwhich men can susser, from fatigue, from famine,
and from the rigor of the climate in those elevated
regions of the torrid zone , where the degree of
cold is hardly inferior to what is felt within the
polar circle. Many of them perifhled; and the
ftrvivors , when they descended into the fertile
plains of Chili , had new difliculties to encounter.
They found there a race of men very different from
the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent,
lnd in their bodily constitution, as well as vigor
f spirit, nearly resembling the warlike tribes in
\orth-America. Though filled with wonder at
he firlt appearance of the Spaniards , and ill
iore astonished at the operations of their cavalry
nll the eflfcts of their fire-arms, the Chilefe soon
('covered so far from their surprise, as not only to
lcfend theinfelves with obstinacy, but to attack
lheir new enemies with more determined fiercenels
han any American nation had hitherto diicovered.
lhe Spaniards , however, continued to penetrate
lto the country, a(nd collected some considerable
lu;.ititics of gold ; but were so far from thinking

B o o ;r of making any settlement amidst such formidable

vi. neighbours, that, in spite of all the experience and
'$i< valor of their leader, the final issue of the expedi.

tion still remained extremely dubious, when they
were recalled from it by an unexpeced revolution
in Peru . The causes of this important eventI
shall endeavour to trace to their source.

An inrur- So many adventurers had flocked to Peru
rAtion of from every Spanish colony in America, and all
the Peru-
vians. with such high expectations of accumulating inde.

pendent fortunes at once, that, to men possessed
with notions so extravagant, any mention of ac-
quiring wealth gradually, and by schemes of
patient industry, would have been not only a
disappointment , but an insult. In order to find
occupation for men who could not with safety
be allowed to remain inaCtive , Pizarro encouraged
some of the molt diftinguilhed officers who had
lately joined him , to invade different provinces o
the empire, which the Spaniards had not hitherto
visited. Several large bodies were formed for this
purpose; and about the time that Almagro set out
for Chili, they marched into remote diftrits o
its ire, the country. No fooncr (lid Manco Capac , th

Inca, observe the inconfiderote security of the Spa
niards in thus dispersing their troops , and that onl

the happy period was at length come for vindicat- o o
ing his own rights, for avenging the wrongs of his vi.
country, and extirpating its opprelfors. Though Xs3s.
tritdly watched by the Spaniards, who allowed
him to reside in the palace of his ancestors at
Cuzco, he found means of communicating his
scheme to the persons who were to be intrusted
with the execution of it. Among people ac-
customed to revere their sovereign as a divinity,
every hint of his will carries the authority of a
command; and they themselves were now con-
vinced , by the daily increase in the number of
their invaders , that the fond hopes which they
had long entertained of their voluntary departure
were altogether vain. All perceived that a vi-
gorous effort of the whole nation was requisite to
expel them , and the preparations for it were car-
ried on with the secrecy and silence peculiar to
Americans.

After some unsuccessful attempts of the Inca aldprogrers.

to make his escape, Ferdinand Pizarro happening
to arrive at that time in Cuzco, he obtained per- 1536.
million from him to attend a great festival which
was to be celebrated a few leagues from the capi-
tal. Under pretext of that solemnity, the great
men of the empire were aflembled. As soon as
the Inca joined them, the standard of war was
erecded; and in a liort time all the fighting men,
from the confines of Quito to the frontier of Chili,
were in arms. Many Spaniards, living securely
on the settlements allotted them, were massacred.
Several detachments, as they marched carelessly

1536. An army amounting ( if we may believe the Spa.

nifh writers) to two hundred thousand men, at.
tacked Cuzco, which the three brothers endea.
voured to dfeni with only o;~i hun(lred and
seventy Spaniards. Another formidable body in.
vested Limla, and kept the governor closely fiut
up. There w.is no longer any communication be.
tween the two cities; the numerous forces of the
Peruvians spreading over the country, intercepted
every meflenger ; and as the parties in Cuzco and
Lima were equally unacquainted with the fate of
their countrymen, each boded the worst concerning
the other, and imagined that they themselves were
the only persons who had survived the general
extinction of the Spanish name in Peru ".

Siege of It was at Cuzco, where the Inca commanded
cU"cÂ°. in person, that the Peruvians made their chicf

effort. During nine months they carried on the
siege with incessant ardor, and in various forms;
and though they displayed not the fame undaunted
ferocity as the Mexican warriors, they cotnduted
some of their operations in a manner which disco-
vered greater sagacity, and a genius more fufccp.

rner, and turn the latter against them. They armed a vl.
considerable body of their bravest warriors with 1536-
the swords, the spears, and bucklers, which they
had taken from the Spanish soldiers whom they
had cut off in different parts of the country. These
they endeavoured to marshal in that regular com-
padc order, to which experience had taught them
that the Spaniards were indebted for their irre-
fiftible force in action. Some appeared in the field
with Spanifli muskets, and had acquired kill and
resolution enough to use them. A few of the
boldest, among whom was the Inca hirnfelf, were
mounted on the horses which they had taken, and
advanced briskly to the'charge like Spanish cava-
liers, with their lances in the reft. It was more by
their numbers, however, than by those imperfect
essays to imitate European arts and to employ Eu-
ropean arms, that the Peruvians annoyed the Spa.
niards . In spite of the valor , heightened by
despair, with which the three brothers defended
Cuzco, Manco Capac recovered possession of one
half of his capital ; and in their various efforts to
drive him out of it , the Spaniards loft Juan Pizar-

efcliping from a country which had been so fatal to
the Spanifli name . While they were brooding
over those defponling thoughts, which their officers
labored in vain to dispel , Almagro appeared fud.
denly in the neighbourhood of Cuzco.

Arrivalof The accounts transmitted to Almagro concern.
Almagro., ing the general infurredion of the Peruvians, were
and motives
f hiscon. such as would have induced him, without hefita.
dut. tion, to relinquish the conquest of Chili, and

halten to the aid of his countrymen. But in this
resolution he was confirmed by a motive less gene.
rous, but more interesting. By the fame messen.
ger who brought him intelligence of the Inca's
revolt, he received the royal patent creating him
governor of Chili, and defiining the limits of his
jurifdidion. Upon confidering the tenor of it, he
deemed it manifest beyond contradiction, that
Cuzco lay within the boundaries of his govern.
ment, and he was equally solicitous to prevent the
Peruvians from recovering possession of their capi.
tal, and to wreQ it out of the hands of the Pizarros.
From impatience to accomplifhl both, he ventured
to return by a new route; and in marching through
the sandy plains on the coast, he suffered, from
heat and drought, calamities of a new species,
hardly inferior to those in which he had been in.
volved by cold and famine on the summits of the
Andes.

His arrival at Cuzco was in a critical moment. B o o it
lie Spaniards and Peruvians fixed their eyes upon vl.
imn with equal solicitude. The former, as he 1537.

loss whether to welcome him as a deliverer, or
o take precautions against him as an enemy. The
atter, knowing the points in conteff between him
nd his countrymen, flattered themselves that they
ad more to hope than to dread from his opera-
ions. Almagro himself, unacquainted with the
etail of the events which had happened in his
bfence, and solicitous to learn the precise posture
f affairs, advanced towards the capital slowly,
nd with great circumfpetion. Various negocia-
ions with both parties were set on foot. The
nca conducted them on his part with much ad-
refs. At first he endeavoured to gain the friend.
ip of Almagro; and after many fruitless over-
ures, despairing of any cordial union with a Spa-
iard, he attacked him by surprise with a nume-
ous bodyof chosen troops. But the Spanifi difci-
line and valor maintained their wonted fuperiori.
. The Peruvians were repulsed with such flaugh-
er, that a great part of their army dispersed, and
Imagro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco with.
ut interruption.
The Pizarros, as they had no longer to make Take pnr.
ead against the Peruvians, directed all their at- r1i"" f
lction towards their new enemy, and took mea-
ires to obftrudc his entry into the capital. Pru-
cncc, however, restrained both parties for some
line from turning their arrus againit one another,

Almagro gained many adherents of the Piz3rros,
who were difgtufled with their harfl domineering
manners. Encouraged by this (ldfeion, he ad.
vanced towards the city by night, surprised the
centinels, or was admitted by them, and invelting
the house where the two brothers resided, compel.
led them, after an obstinate defence, to surrender
at difcrction. Almagro's claim of jurifdiclion over

of administration established in his name .

cut off by the Peruvians. This body, which, at

the capital before they knew that they had an
enemy more formidable than Indians to encounter

It was with atonlhment that they beheld their n o o
countrymen posted on the banks of the river Aban- vi.

wiflied rather to gain than to conquer them, and
by bribes and promises endeavoured to seduce their
leader. The fidelity of Alvarado remained un-
flhaken; but his talents for war were not equal to
his virtue. Almagro amused him with various
movements, of which he did not comprehend the
meaning, while a large detachment of chosen July I.
soldiers passed the river by night, fell upon his
crimp by surprise, broke his troops before they had
time to form, and took him prisoner, together

scruples which suited not the chief of a party who
had drawn his sword in civil war. Feelings of hu.
manity restrained him from shedding the blood of
his opponents; and the dread of being deemed a
rebel, deterred him from entering a province
which the king had allotted to another. Though
he knew that arms muff terminate the dispute be-
tween him and Pizarro, and resolved not to flun
that mode of decision, yet, with a timid delicacy
preposterous at such a juncture, he was so solicitous
that his rival should be confidered as the aggressor,

his approach".

exteroufly protradled the negociation to fuih a

desire of vengeance, excited by recollection of B O O 1K
their own recent disgrace and sufferings. After an vr.
unflccefsful attempt to cross the mountains in thle s3s.
lirecd road between Lina and Cuzco, they
marched towards the south along the coast as far
as Nafca, and then turning to the left, penetrated
through the defiles in that branch of the Andes
which lay between tlem and the capital. Almagro,
iiillead of hearkeniig to some of his officers,
lwho advised him to attempt the defence of those
diiiicult passes , waited the approach of the enemy
in the plain of Cuzco. Two reasons seem to have
induced him to take this resolution. His followers
amounted( hardly to five hundred, and he was
afraid of weakening such a feeble body, by fend-
ing any detachment towards the mountains. His
cavalry far exceeded that of. the adverse party,
both in number and discipline, and it was only
in an open country that he could avail himself of

of the conquerors stained the glory which they
acquired by this complete victory. The violence of
civil rage hurried on some to slaughter their coun-
trvmen with indiscriminate cruelty; the meanness
of private revenge inftigatJ others to tingle out
individuals as the objecs of their vengeance. Or-
gognez and several officers of diftindion were maf-
sacred in cold blood; above a hundred and forty
soldiers fell in the field; a large proportion, where
the number of combatants were few, and the heat
of the contest soon over. Amagro, thoug so
feeble that he could not bear the motion of a
horse, had infilled on being carried on a litter to an
eminence which overlooked the field of battle.

leaders who undertook any of those new expedi.

although his doom was determined by the Pizarros
from the moment that he fell into their hands,
prudence conftiained them to defer gratifying their
vengeainc, until the soldiers who had served under
him, as well as several of their own followers in
whom they could not perfedly-confide, had left
Cuzco. As soon as they set out upon their differ-
ent expeditions, Almagro was impeached of trea-
son, formally tried, and condemned to die. The condemnetd
sentence alonifhed him, and though he had often
braved death with undaunted spirit in the field,
its approach under this ignominious form appalled
him so much, that he had recourse to abjet sup-
plications, unworthy of his former fame. He be-
fought the Pizarros to remember the ancient friend-
ship between their brother and him, and how much
he had contributed to the prosperity of their fa-

to chalk out the line of conduct that ought to be

Spaniards, though more robust, and inured to a thley eldure
variety of climates suffered considerably, and loft

country their distress increased. During two
months it rained incessantly, without any interval
of fair weather long enough to dry their clothes '.
The vast plains upon which they were now entering,
either altogether without inhabitants, or occupied
by the rudest and east industrious tribes in the
New World, yielded little subsistence. They could
not advance a tep but as they cut a road through

than sufficient to have exhausted and dispirited any

rich countries before them, they persisted in ftrug-

grandeur. There, with infinite labor, they built

lowing the course of the MVaragnon , until it joined

doned his fellow-foldiers in a pathless desert, where
they had hardly any hopes of success, or even of
safety, bu what weie founded on the service which
they expected from the bark; his crime is, in some
imafure, balanced by the glory of having ventured
upon a navigation of near two thoufind leagues,

The vanity inatural to travellers who visit regions
unknown to the reft of mankind, and the art of an
adventurer, solicitous to magnify his own merit,
concurred in prompting him to mingle an extraor-
inary proportion of the marvellous in the narra-

'ered nations so rich, that the roofs of their
emrples were covered with plates of gold; and de-
ribed a republic of women so warlike and power-

defended the entry, and supported by his hail

iS4i. ness of his government in the latter years of his

life, the number of malecontents was considerable,
declared without hesitation in favor of Almagro,
and he was soon at the head of eight hundred of
the most gallant veterans in Peru, As his youth
and inexperience disqualified him, from taking the
command of them himself, he appointed Herrada
to ad as general. But thotugh lrmagro fpecdily
collected such a respectable force, the acquiescence
in his government was far fromr being general.
Pizarro had left many friends to whom his memory
was dear; the barbarous affalination of a man to
whom his country was so highly indebted, filled
every impartial person with horror. The igpomi-
nious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful
tite on which he founded his pretensions, led
others to confider him as an usurper. The officers
who commanded in some provinces refused to re-
cognise his authority, until it was confirmed by
the emperor. In others, particularly at Cuzco,
the royal standard was erected, and preparations
made to revenge the murder of their ancient
leader.

Arrivalof Those feeds of discord, which could not have
acarde lain long dormant, acquired great vigor and ai-

vity, when the arrival of Vaca de Castro was
known. After a long and disastrous voyage, he
was driven by stress of weather into a small har-
bour in the province of Popayan ; and proceeding
from thence by land, after a journey no Icfs tedious

thandifficult, he reached Quito. In his way he R o o K

withoQut hesitation by Benalcazar, Adelantado, or
ieitenant-general for the emperor in Popayan,
nd by edro de Puelles, who, in the absence of
Gonza!o Pizarro, had the command of the troops
eft in Quito. Vaca de Castro not only assumed
he supreme authority, but showed that he pof-
esed the talents which the exercise of it at that
undure required. By his influence and address he
bon affernbled such a body of troops, as not only
t him above all fear of being exposed to any in-
ult from the adverse party, but enabled him to
dvance frorm Quito with the dignity that became
is charader. By dispatching perfoins of confi-
ence to the different settlements in Peru, with a
ormal notification of his arrival and of his com-
iffiop, he communicated to his countrymen the
oyal pleasure with refped to the government of
he coyntry. By private emissaries, he excited
uch officers as had discovered their disapprobation
f Almagro's proceedings, to manifest their duty
o their sovereign by supporting the person honored
ith his commission. Those measures were pro-
tucive of great effets. Encouraged by the ap-
roach of the new governor, or prepared by his
anchinations, the loyal were confirmed in their
rinciples, and avowed them with greater bold-,

o' t ness; the timid ventured to declare their senti.

give an effectual check to it before the arrival of

for Cuzco, where the most considerable body of
opponents had erected the royal standard, under
the command of Pedro Alvarez Holguin. During
his march thither, Herrada, the skilful guide of
his youth and of his counsels, died; and from that
time his measures were conspicuous for their vio.
lence, but concerted with little sagacity, and exe.
cuted with no address. Holguin, who, with forces
far inferior to those of the opposite party, was de.

tenor of his past life to the habits of a sedentary 1Â¶42.
and pacific profession, he at once affuned the adi-
vity and discovered the decision of an officer long
accustomed to command. Knowing his strength to
be now far superior to that of the enemy, he was
impatient to terminate the contest by a battle.
Nor did the followers of Almagro , who had no
hopes of obtaining a pardon for a crime so atro-
cious as the murder of the governor, decline that
mode of decision. They met at Chupaz, about two Sept. I.
hundred miles from Cuzco, and fought with all
the fierce animosity inspired by the. violence of
civil rage, the rancor of private enmity, the
eagerness of revenge, and the last efforts of despair.

of his troops, his own intrepidity, and the martial
talents of Francisco de Carvajal, a veteran officer
formed under the great captain in the wars of
Italy, and who on that day laid the foundation of
his future fame in Peru, triumphed over the
bravery of his opponents, though led on by young
Almagro with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better
cause, and deserving another fate. The carnage
wvds great in proportion to the number of the com-
batants. Many of the vanquiflhed , especially fucl
as were conscious that they might be charged with
being accessory to the affiffination of Pizarro, rufn-

America, that rapid and extensive as the Spanish n o o
conquests there had been, they were not carried vi.
on by ay regular exertion of the national force, Is4j.
but by the occasional efforts of private adventurers.
After fitting out a few of the first armaments for
discovering new regions, the court of Spain, during
the busy reigns of Ferdinand and of Charles V,
the former the most intriguing prince of the age,
and the latter the moft.ambitious, was encumbered
with such a multiplicity of schemes, and involved
in war with so many nations of Europe, that it had
not leisure to attend to distant and less interesting
objects. The care of prosecuting discovery, or of
attempting conquest, ,was abandoned to individuals;
and with such ardor did men push forward in
this new career, on which novelty, the spirit of
adventure, avarice, ambition, and the hope of
meriting heaven, prompted them with combined
influence to enter, that in less than half a century
almost the whole of that extensive empire which
Spain now possesses in the New World, was sub-
jeted to its dominion. As the Spanifi court con-
tributed nothing towards the various expeditions
undertaken in America, it was not entitled to claim
much from their success. The sovereignty of the
conquered provinces, with the fifth of the gold
and silver, was reserved for the crown; every
thing else was seized by the associates in each ex-
pedition as their own right. The plunder of the
countries which they invaded served to indem-
nify them for what they had expended in equip-
ping themselves for the service , and the

B o o conquered territory was divided among them, ac

vi. cording to rules which custom had introduced, a

permanent establishments which their fuccefsfu
valor merited. In the infancy of those settlements
when their extent as wel! as their value were un
known , many irregularities escaped observation,
and it was found necessary to connive at- man)
cxceffcs. The conquered people were pillaged witi
deftrudive rapacity, and their country parcelled
out among its new masters in exorbitant shares, fai
exceeding the highest recompence due to thei
services. The rude conquerors of America, in.
capable of forming their eftablifhmcnts upon any
general or extensive plan of policy, attentive only
to private interest, unwilling to forego present gain
from the profped of remote or public benefit, seen
to have had no object but to amass sudden wealth,
without regarding what might be the consequence!
of the means by which they acquired 'it. But
when time at length discovered to the Spanifi
court the importance of its American poffeflions,
the necessity of new-modelling their whole frame
became obvious, and in place of the maxims and
practices , prevalent among military adventurers,
it was found requisite to fubltitute the iftitutions
of rcgl:lar government.

One evil in particular called for an immediate

remedy. The conquerors of Mexico and Peru
imitated the fatal example of their countrymen
fettled in the illands, and employed themselves in
searching for gold and silver with the fame inconi
fidarate cagernefs. Similar cfi'cds followed. Thl

natives employed in this labor by maflers, who in B o o K
imposing talks had no regard either to what they vI.
felt or to what they were able to perform, pined I42.
away and perished so fast, that there was reason to
apprehend that Spain, instead of pofefling coun-
tries peopled to such a degree as to be susceptible
of progressive improvement, would soon remain
proprietor only of a vast uninhabited desert.

The emperor and his ministers were so sensible
of this, and so solicitous to prevent the extinction
of the Indian race, which threatened to render their
acquisitions of no value, that from time to time
various laws, which I have mentioned, had been
made for securing to that unhappy people more
gentle and equitable treatment. But the distance
of America from the feat of empire, the feebleness
of government in the new colonies, the avarice and
audacity of soldiers unaccustomed to restraint, pre-
vented these salutary regulations from operating
with any considerable influence. The evil' conti-
nued to grow, and at this time the emperor found
an interval of leisure from the affairs of Europe to
take it into attentive consideration. He consulted Thl perrou
not only with his ministers and the members of the "it' ,,h""'
council of the Indies, but called upon several
persons who had resided long in the New World, to
aid them with the result of their experience and
observation. Fortunately for the people of Ame.
rica, among these was Bartholomew de las Casa%,
who happened to be then at MVldrd on a miflion
from a Chapter of his order at Chipa7. Though,

zeal in behalf of the former objets of his pit,
was so far from abating, that, from an increafei
knowledge of their sufferings, its ardor had aug
mented. He seized eagerly this opportunity
reviving his favorite maxims concerning th
treatment of the Indians. With the moving elo
quence natural to a man on whose nind thi
scenes which he had beheld had made a deec
impression, he described the irreparable waste
the human species in the New World, the Indiat
race almost totally swept away in the island it
less than fifty years, and hastening to extinction or
the continent with the fame rapid decay. Witi
the decisive tone of one strongly prepossessed with
the truth of his own system, he imputed all tlii
to a single cause, to the exactions and cruelty l
his countrymen, and contended that nothing could
prevent the depopulation of America, but the de
daring of its natives to be freemen, and treating
them as fubjetds, not as slaves. Nor did he con.
fide for the success of this proposal in the powers
of his oratory alone. In order to enforce them, he
composed his famous treatise concerning the de
itruction of America", in which he relates, with
many horrid circumstances, but with apparent
marks of exaggerated description, the devastation

self merely as an executive officer, without any dif.
cretionary power; and, regardless of whatever he
observed or heard concerning the state of the
country, he adhered to the letter of the regulations
with unrelenting rigor. In all the towns through
which he passed , the natives were declared to be
free, every person in public office was deprived of
his lands and servants ; and as an example of obe.
dicnce to others, he would not fffer a single In.
dian to be employed in carrying his own baggage
in his march towards Lima. Amazement and
conflrnation went before him as he approached;
and so little solicitous was he to prevent these from
augmenting, that, on entering the capital, he
opcily avowed that he came to obey the orders

f his sovereign, not to dispense with his laws. B o o t
his harlh declaration was accompanied with what vi.
cndered it still more intolerable, haughtiness in IS43
eportmcnt, a tone of arrogance and decision in
dicoliufe, and an insolence of office grievous to
en little accustomed to hold civil authority in
i;h refped. Every attempt to procure a sus.
ciifion or mitigation of the new laws, the viceroy
onlidered as flowing from a spirit of difaffecdion
hat tended to rebellion. Several persons of rank
were confined, and some put to death, without
ny form of trial. Vaca de Castro was arrested,

ank, and his merit in having prevented a general
nfirredtion in the colony, he was loaded with

and conquest of which Spain was indebted to his
family. These thoughts prompted him to seek si
vengeance, and to assert the rights of his family,
of which he now confidered himself as the guar.
dian and the heir. But as no Spaniard can easily
surmount that veneration for his sovereign which
seems to be interwoven in his frame, the idea of
marching in arms against the royal standard filled
him with horror. He hesitated long, and was ill
unresolved, when the violence of the viceroy, the
universal call of his countrymen, and the certainty
of becoming soon a victim himself to the feverityof
the new laws, moved him to quit his residence at
Chuquifaca de la Plata, and repair to Cuzco. All
the inhabitants went out to meet him, and re.
ceived him with transports of joy as the deliverer
of the colony. In the, fervor of their zeal, they
clected him procurator-general of the Spanifli na
tio n Peru, to solicit the repeal of' the late regu.
lations. They empowered him to lay their re.

assumed the supreme direction of affairs into their
own hands, ifTued a proclamation suspending the
execution of the obnoxious laws, and sent a mef.
sage to Pizarro, requiring him, as they had already
granted whatever he could request, to dismiss his
troops, and to repair to Lima with fifteen or
twenty attendants. They could hardly exped that
a man so daring and ambitious would tamely corn
ply with this requisition. It was made, probably,
with no such intention, but only to throw a de.
cent veil over their own conduct; for Cepeda, the
president of the court of audience, a pragmatical
and aspiring lawyer, seems to have held a secret
correspondence with Pizarro, and had already
formed the plan, which he afterwards executed,
of devoting himself to his service. The imprison-
rnent of the viceroy, the usurpation of the judges,
together with the univerftl confusion and anarchy
confeqent upon events so fingularand unexpected,
opened new and vast profpeds to Pizarro. He
now beheld the supreme power within his reach.

or did he want courage to push on towards the n o o x
object which fortune presented to his view. Car- vI.
vajal, the prompter of his resolutions, and guide 1544
of all his ations, had long fixed his eye upon it
s the only end at which Pizarro ought to aim.
Instead of the inferior function of procurator for
the Spanish settlements in Peru, he openly de-
manded to be governor and captain-general of the
whole province, and required the court of audi-
ence to grant him a commission to that effect. At
the head of twelve hundred men, within a mile of
Lima, where there was neither leader nor army to
oppose him , such a request carried with it the au-
thority of a command. But the judges, either
fiom unwillingness to relinquish power, or from
a desire of preserving some attention to appear-
ances, hesitated, orfeemed to hesitate, about com-
plying with what he demanded. Carvajal, impatient He affumet
of delay, and impetuous in all his operations, march- thegovern-
ed into the city by night, seized several officers
of diftindion bnoxious to Pizarro, and hanged
them without the formality of a trial. Next morn-
ing the court of audience issued a commiflion in
the emperor's name, appointing Pizarro governor
of Peru, with full powers, civil as well as mili-
Lary, and he entered the town that day with ex-
traordinary pomp, to take possession of his new
dignity '.

on board a vessel by the judges of the audience,
in order that he might be carried to Spain under

ber; as soon as they were out at sea, Alvarez,
either touched with remorse or moved by fear,
kneeled down to his prisoner, declaring him from
that moment to be free, and that he himself, and
every person in the ship, would obey him as the
legal representative of their sovereign. Nugnez
Vela ordered the pilot of the vessel to fliape his
course towards Tumbez, and as soon as he land-
ed there, ereted the royal standard, and refum-
ed his functions of viceroy. Several persons of
note, to whom the contagion of the fclitious
spirit which reigned at Cuzco and Limna had not
reached, inflantly avowed their resolution to sup.
port his authority". The violence of Pizarro's

unforgiving severity, soon augmented the number vl.
of the viceroy's adherents, as it forced some
leading men in the colony to fly to him for re-
ftge. While he was gathering such strength at
Tumbez, that his forces began to assume the ap-
pearance of what was confidered as an army in
America, Diego Centeno, a bold and aive offi-
cer, exasperated by the cruelty and oppression of
Pizarro's lieutenant-governor in the province of
Charcas, formed a conspiracy against his life,
cut him off, and declared for the viceroy '.

Pizarro, though alarmed with those appear- 14,.

assert the authority to which he had attained, with
the spirit and condut of an officer accustomed to

roy as the enemy who was nearest as well as most
formidable. As he was mailer of the public re-
venues in Peru, and most of the military men
were attached to his family, his troops were so
numerous, that the viceroy, unable to face them,
retreated towards Quito. Piza;rro followed him;
and in that long march, through a wild moun-
tainous country, suffered hardihips and encoun-
tered difficulties, which no troops but those ac-
customed to serve in America could have endured
or fulrmounted ". The viceroy had scarcely reached

abandoned a town incapable of defence, and witb
a rapidity more resembling a flight than a retreat
marched into the province of Popayan. Pizarrc
continued to pursue; but finding it impossible to
overtake him, returned to Quito. From thenc
he dispatched Carvajal to oppose Centeno, wha
was growing formidable in the southern province
of the empire, and he himself remained there to

urged him to make overtures of accommodation

this intention he marched back to Quito. Pizarro

was cut off, and placed on the public gibbet in
Quito, which Pizarro entered in triumph. The
troops assembled by Centeno were dfperfed son

o the mountains, where he remained for several
months concealed in a cave. Every person in
cru, from the frontiers o Popayan to those of

er Pedro de Hinojofa , he had not only the unri.
alled command of the South-Sea, but had taken

n o o during the first transports of their exultation, they

vr. ran into every exccs of licentious indulgence, with
1546. the riotous spirit usual among low adventurers

upon extraordinary ficcefs. But amidst this dif.
fipation, their chief and his confidents were obliged
to turn their thoughts sometimes to what was fe.
rious, and dliberated with much solicitude con.
ccrning the part that he ought now to take. Car.
vajal, no less bold and decisive in counsel than in
the field, had from the beginning warned Pizarro,
that in the career on which he was entering , it was
vain to think of holding a middle course; that lie
mufi either boldly aim at all, or attempt nothing.
From the time that Pizarro obtained poffcllion of
the government of Peru, he inculcated the fame
maxim with greater earnestness. Upon receiving
an account of the victory at Quito, he remonstrated
with him in a tone Rill more peremptory. "You
have usurped (said he, in a letter written to Pizarro
on that occasion) the supreme power in this coun.
try, in contempt of the emperor's comrnilion to
the viceroy. You have marched, in hostile array,
against the royal standard ; you have attacked the
representative of your fovercign in the field, have
defeated him, and cut off his head. Think not
that ever a monarch will forgive fich inflits on lhis
dign ity, or that any reconciliation with him can be
cordial or sincere. l)epend no longer on the pre.
carious favor of another. Allime yourself tlhe
fovereigty over a country, to the dominion of
which your family has a title founded on the riglis
both of discovery and concjucfl. It is in your

power to attach every Spaniard in Peru of any B o o K
confequcnce inviolably to your interest by liberal vi.
grants of lands and of Indians, or by infli.uting i546.
ranks of nobility, and creating titles of honor
similar to those which are courted with so much
eagerness in Europe. By cleablilning orders of
knighthood, with privileges and diftinAtions re-
fenbling those in Spain, you may bestow a grati-
fication upon the officers in your service, suited to
the ideas of military men. Nor is it to your coun-
trymen only that you ought to attend; endeavour
to gain the natives. By marrying the Coya, or
daughter of the Sun next in succession to the crown,
you will induce the Indians, out of veneration for
the blood of their ancient princes, to unite with
the Spaniards in support of your authority. Thus,
at the head of the ancient inhabitants of Peru, as
well as of the new settlers there, you may set at
defiance the power of Spain , and repel with ease
any feeble force which it can fend at such a dif-
tance." Cepeda, the lawyer, who was now Pi-
zarro's confidential counsellor, warmly seconded
Carvajal's exhortations, and employed whatever
learning he poflcffed in demonstrating, that all the
founders of great monarchies had been raised to
pre-eminence, not by the antiquity of their lineage,
or the validity of their rights , but by tleir own
asir-ing valor and pelfonal merit'.

wis46' But happily for the tranquillity of the world, few
courrof men possess that superior frength of mind, and
Spain, extent of abilities, which are capable of forming

and executing such daring schemes, as cannot be
accomplifled without overturning the eftablilled
order of society, and violating those maxims of
duty which men are accuflomed to hold sacred.
The mediocrity of Pizarro's talents circumscribed
his ambition within more narrow limits. Instead
of aspiring at independent power, he confined his
views to the obtaining from the court of Spain a
confirmation of the authority which he now pof-
sessed; and for that purpose, he sent an officer of
diftindtion thither, to give such a representation of
his condud, and of the state of the country, as
might induce the emperor and his ministers, either
from inclination or from necessity, to continue him
in his present station.

Conrulta. While Pizarro was deliberating with refped to
tions of the
Spanih m. the part which he flould take, consultations were
infltr. held in Spain , with no less solicitude, concerning the

measures which ought to be pursued in order tore.
eflablilh the emperor's authority in Peru. Though
unacquainted with the last excesses of outrage to
which the malecontents had proceeded in that coun,
try, the court had received an account of the infur,
rcdion against the viceroy, of his imprisonment, and
the usurpation of the government by Fizarro. A
revolution so alarming called for an immediate inter.
position of the emperor's abilities and authority.

But as he was fully occupied at that time in Ger. n o o
many, in conducting the war against the famous VI.
league of Smalkalde , one of the most interesting and 546
arduous enterprises in his reign, the care of providing
a remedy for the disorders in Peru devolved upon
his son Philip, and the counsellors whom Charles
had appointed to afTift him in the government of
Spain during his absence. At first view, the ac-
tions of Pizarro and his adherents appeared so re-
pugnant to the duty of fubjedts towards their so-
vereign, that the greater part of the ministers in-
sised on declaring them inflantly to be guilty of
rebellion, and on proceeding to punish them with
exemplary rigor. But when the fervor of their
zeal and indignation began to abate, innumerable
obstacles to the execution of this measure presented
themselves. The veteran bands of infantry, the
strength and glory of the Spanish armies, were
then employed in Germany. Spain, exhaufled of
men and money by a long series of wars, in which
ihe had been involved by the restless ambition of
two successive monarchs, could not easily equip an
armament of sufficient force to reduce Pizarro. To
transport any refpeCdable body of troops to a
country so remote as Peru, appeared almost imr
pollible. While Pizarro continued master of the
South.Sea, the diret route by Nombre de Dios
and Panama was impracticable. An attempt to
march to Quito by land through the new kingdom
of Granada, and the province of Popayan, across
regions of vast extent, desolate, unhealthy, or in-
habited by fierce and hostile tribes, would be

I3

B o attended with unfrmountable danger and hardnl;ph.

vi. The pallage to the South-Sea by the Straits of
14-. J\lagellan was so tedious, so uncertain, and so

little known in that age, that no confidence could
be placed in any effort carried on in a course of
navigation so remote and precarious. Nothing
then remained but to relilnqiih the system which
the ardor of their loyalty had lirft suggested, and
to attempt by lenient mcafures what could not be
effecded by force. It was manifcft, from Pizarro's
solicitude to represent his con(dut in a favorable
light to the emperor, that, notwithstanding the
excesses of which he had been guilty, he ftillre.
tained sentiments of veneration for his sovereign.
By a proper application to these, together vth
some fch concessions as flould discover a spirit
of moderation and forbearance in government,
there was fill room to hope that he might be yet
reclaimed , or the ideas of loyalty natural to Spa.
niards might so far revive among his followers,
that they would no longerlend their aid to uphold
his usurped authority.

trafcaap- The success, however, of this negociation, no
poiited cO
repairom less delicate than it was important, depended en.
V'eri as pre. tirely on the abilities and address of the person to
si"e"t. whom it flhonld be committed. After weighing

with much attention the comparative merit of
various persons, the Spanif miniLters fixed with
unanimiy of choice upon Pedro de la Gafca, a
prierf in no higher station than that of counsellor
to the Inquisition. Though in no pblic office, he
had been occarionally employed by government in

affairs of trust and consequence, and had condudt- n o o
ed them with no less skill than success; displaying vi.
a gentle and insinuating temper, accompanied with s46.
much firmness; probity, fiperior to any feeling of
private interest; and a cautious circumfpcction ill
concerting measures, followed by such vigor in
executing them, as is rarely found in alliance with
the other. These qualities marked him out for the
l{iunioil to which he was defined. The emperor,
to whom Gafca was not unknown, warmly ap-
proved of the choice, and communicated it to him
in a letter, containing cxpreflions of good-will and
confidence, no less honorable to the prince who
wrote, than to the subjet who received it. Gafca,
notwithflanding his advanced age and feeble
c.lnfitution, and though, from the apprchenfions
natural to a man, who, during the course of his
life, had never been out of his own country, he
dreaded the effedts of a long voyage, and of an
unhealthy climate ", did not hesitate a moment
about complying with the will of his sovereign.
But as a proof that it was from this principle His mnodera
alone he ated, he refnfed a bifliopric which was tol"'
offered to him, in order that lie might appear in
Peru with a more dignified charader; he would
accept of no higher title than that of president
of the court of audience in Lima; and declared
Ihat lie would receive no salary on account of
his discharging the duties of that oice. All he
required was, that the expense of fpporting his

v'. he was to go like a minifler of peace with his
I54s govwn and breviary, and without any retinue but

a few domestics, this would not load the revenue
with any enormous burden ".

Th- poers But while he discovered fch disinterested mo.
t',imited deration with rfped to whatever related pe fonally

to himself, he demanded his official powers in a
very different tone. He insisted, as he was to be
employed in a country so remote from the feat of
government, where he could not have recourse to
hi, fovrreign for new inftrudions on every emer.
gen c, an! as the whole success of his nego.
ciations mitfl depirid upon the confidence which
the people with whom he had to treat could place
in the extent of his powers, that he ought to be
invelved with unlimited authority); that his jllif-
dicio munuft reach to all persons and to all causes;
that he muff be empowered to pardon, to puniff,
or to reward, as circumflances and the behaviour
of different men might require; that, in cafe of
reffitance from the malecontents, he might be au-
thorized to reduce them to obedience by force of
arms, to levy troops for that purpose, and to call
for aiftance from the governors of all the Spanifi
settlements in America. These powers, though
manifestly conducive to the great objedts of his
million, appeared to the Spanifl miniflers to be

alicnable prerogatives of royalty, which ought n o o

ighlv satisfied with this fresh proof of his malter's
nfidence, Gafca hastened hWs departure, and,
'ithout either money or troops, set out to quell
formidable rebellion '. May 6.

ch dignity as to excite terror, that he was re-
ived with much refpecd. From Nombre de Dios
advanced to Panama, and met with a similar
ception from Hinojofa, whom Pizarro had in-
ulled with the government of that town, anid the
mmin(d of his fleet flationed there. In both
aces he held the fame language, declaring that

occupy the president's attention. The one was to
find immediately such employment for a multitude
of turbulent and daring adventurers with which
the country was filled, as might prevent them
from exciting new commotions. The other, to
bestow proper gratifications upon those to whose
loyalty and valor he had been indebted for his
success. The former of these was in some measure
accomplifled, by appointing Pedro de Valdivia to
prosecute the conquest of Chili; and by empower.
ing Diego Centeno to undertake the discovery of
the vast regions bordering on the river De la
Plata. The reputation of those leaders, together
with the hopes of acquiring wealth, and of
rising to consequence in some unexplored country,
alluring many of the most indigent and desperate
foldicis to follow their flandards, drained off no
inconsiderable portion of that mutinous spirit which
Gafca dreaded.

ave leisure to weigh the comparative merit of
eir several claims with accuracy, he retired,

a village twelve leagues from Cuzco. There

the genius and manners of that people. The
bfcurity in which the ignorance of its conquerors
nvolved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by
e superstition of those who succeeded them. As

R o O1 selfed, rather than peopled, by finall independent

vii. tribes, whose mode of life and manners resembled

those of the rudest savages which we have de.
fcribed. But about a period corresponding to the
beginning of the tenth century in the Christian
era, several tribes moved in fucceflive migrations
from unknown regions towards the north and
north-wef , and fettled in different provinces of
Anahuac, the ancient name of New Spain. There,
more civilized than the original inhabitants, began
to form them to the arts of social life. At length,
towards the commencement of the thirteenth cen,
tury, the 1Mexicans, a people more polished thaa
any of the former, advanced from the borderol
the Californian gulf, and took possession of tht
plains adjacent to a great lake near the centre ol
the country. After residing there about fifty years,
they founded a town, since distinguished by thi
name of Mexico, which from humble beginning!
soon grew to be the molt considerable city in thi
New World. The Mexicans, long after they wen
established in their new poffellions, continued, lik
other martial tribes in America, unacquainted vitl
regal dominion, and were governed in peace, an
conduced in war, by such as were entitled to pl
eminence by their wisdom or their valor. Bt
among them, as in other ates whose power an

B o o is fvorable to their progress, they advance so

vit. slowly towards any maturity of strength or policy,

that the recent origin of the Mexicans seems to be a
itrong presumption of some exaggeration, in the
splendid descriptions which have been given of their
government and manners.

Yacttwhich But it is not by theory or conjedures that his.
,rogetriir tory decides with regard to the fbte or charaler of

every judgment which it ventures to pronounce. In
colleding those which mull regulate our opinion
in the prefcnt inquiry, some occur that suggest an
idea of confilerable progress in civilization in the
Mexican empire, and others which seem to indi.
cate that it had advanced but little beyond the
savage tribes around it. Both shall be exhibited
to the view of the reader, that, from comparing
them, he may determine on which fide the evidence
preponderates.

The right of In the.Mexican empire, the right of private pro.
prPverty perty was perfectly underflood, and efablifhedin
fully f0ab? a eaie
blished, its full extent. Among several savage tribes, we

have seen, that the idea of a title to the separate and
exclusive poffefion of any objet was hardly known;
and that among all, it was extremely limited and
ill defined. But in Mexico, where agriculture and
industry had made some progress , the diflinion
between property in land and property in goods had
taken place. Both might be transferred from one
person to another by falc or barter; both might
descend by inheritance. Every person who could
be denominated a freeman had property in land.

Thi, however, they held by various tenures. Some B o o 1e
possessed it in full right , and it descended to their VII.
heirs. '1 he title of others to their lands was de-
rived from the office or dignity which they enjoyed;
and when deprived of the latter, they loft posses-
sion of the former. Both these modes of occupy-
ing land were deemed noble, and peculiar to citi-
zens of the highest class. The tenure, by which
the great body of the people held their property,
was very different. In every diflric a certain quan-
tity of land was measured out in proportion to the
number of families. This was cultivated by the
nint labor of the whole, its produce was depo-
ited in a common orehoufe, and divided among
hem according to their refpedtive exigencies. The
embers of the Calpullee, or afociations, could not
lienate their share of the common estate ; it was
nindivifible permanent property, destined f6r the
ipport of their families . In consequence of this
iftribution of the territory of the slate, every man
id an interest in its welfare, and the happiness
f the individual was conneded with the public
ecurity.

Another firiking circumfance , which diftin- The number

riod, from choice as well as from neceflity, or at
the utmost assemble in small hamlets on the banks
of the river which supplies them with food, or on
the border of some plain left open by nature, or
cleared by their own labor. The Spaniards, ac.
customed to this mode of habitation among all the
savage tribes with which they were then acquaint
ed, were aftonifled, on entering New Spain, to find
the natives residing in towns of fch extent as re.
fembled those of Europe. In the fir[t fervor of
their admiration, they compared Zempoalla, though
a town only of the second or third size, to the ci.
ties of greatest note in their own country. When
afterwards, they ifited in fuccelfion Tlafcala , Cho
lula, Tacuba, Tezeuco, and Mlexico itself, thei
amazement increased so much, that it led them to
convey ideas of their magnitude and populou
ness bordering on what is incredible. Even whet
there is leisure for observation , and no interest tha
leads to deceive, conjedural estimates of the nul
ber of people in cities are extremely loose, an
:ifually much exaggerated. It is not surprising
then, that Cortes and his companions, little i
customed to such computations , and powerfull
tempted to magnify, in order to exalt the merits
their own difcovcrics and conquefs , should has
been betrayed into this common error , and hav

For this reason, some considerable abatement ought v11.

viI. the mason, the weaver, the goldsmith, the painter,

and of several other crafts, were carried on by dif.
ferent pcrfons. Each was regularly inftruded in
his calling. To it alone his industry was confined;
and by afiduous application to one object, together
with the peifevering patience peculiar to Ameri.
cans, their artisans attained to a degree of neatness
and perfection in work, far beyond what could have
been expected from the rude tools which they em.
ployed. Their various producions were brought
into commerce ; and by the exchange of them in
the dated markets held in the cities, not only were
their mutual wants supplied , in such orderly in.
tercourfe as characterizes an improved slate of so.
ciety, but their industry was daily rendered perse.
vering and inventive.

The difinc. The diflinceion of ranks eftablifled in the Mexi.

tention. In surveying the savage tribes of Ame.
rica, we observed, that consciousness of equality,
and impatience of Subordination , are sentiments na.
tural to man in the infancy of civil life. During
peace, the authority of a fperior is hardly felt
among them, and even in war it is but little ac-
knowledged. Strangers to the idea of property,
the difference in condition resulting from the in-
equality of it is unlknown. Birth or titles confer

accoinplifhments that diftindion can be acquired. vii.
The form of focicty was very different among the
Mexicans. 'The great body of the people was in a
molt humiliating state. A considerable number,
known by the name of Mayeques, nearly resembling
in condition those peafints who, under various de-
nominations , were confidered, during the preva-
lence of the feudal fyftemr, as instruments of labor
attached to the foil. 'Ihe Mayeques could not change
their place of residence without permiflion of the
superior on whom they depended. They were
conveyed, together with the lands on which they
were fettled, from one proprietor to another; and
were bound to cultivate the ground, and to per-
form several kinds of servile work ". Others were
reduced to the lowest form of fubjedion, that of do-
meftic servitude, and felt the utmost rigor of that
wretched state. Their condition was held to be so
vile, and their lives deemed to be of so little value,
that a person who killed one of those slaves was
not fbjeded to any punishment ". Fven those
confidered as freemen were treated by their haughty
ords as beings of an inferior species. The nobles,
offeffed of ample territories, were divided into
Various classes, to each of which peculiar titles of
honor belonged. Some of these titles, like their
land , descended from father to son in perpetual
succession. Others were annexed to particular

joyed extensive power, and supreme dignity. Thus
the diftindion of ranks was completely etablifhed,
in a line of regular fibordination, reaching from
the highest to the lowest member of the commu.
lnity. Each of there knew what he could claim, and
what he owed. The people, who were not allowe
to wear a dress of the fame fashion, or to dwell in
houses of a form similar to those of the nobles, ac.
cofled them with the most fubmitlive reverence. In
the presence of their sovereign , they durfl not lif
their eyes from the ground, or look him in th
face ". The nobles themselves, vwhen admitted to
an audience of their sovereign, entered bare-footed
in mean garments, and, as his slaves, paid him
homage approaching to adoration. This refpet due
from inferiors to those above them in rank, wa
eftablifled with such ceremonious accuracy , thati
incorporated with the language, and influenced it
genius and idiom. The Mexican tongue abounde
.in exprelfions of reverence and courtesy. The sty
and appellations, used in the intercourse between
equals, would have been so unbecoming in th
mouth of one in a lower sphere, when he accosted

under the government of his predecessors, that we
can discover what was the original form and genius
of Mexican policy, From the foundation of the
monarchy to the election of Montezuma , it seems
to have subsisted with little variation. That body
of citizens, which may be diitinguifled by the
name of nobility formed the chief and mot re.
fpetable order in the state. They were of varioui
ranks, as has already been observed, and their
honors were acquired and transmitted in different
manners. Their number seems to have been great,
According to an author accustomed to exatni
with attention what he relates, there were in th
Mexican empire thirty of this order, each of whoa
had in his territories about a hundred thoufan
people , and fubordinate.to these, there were about
three thousand nobles of a lower class ". 1 he ter
ritories belonging to the chiefs of Tezeuco an
Tacuba, were hardly inferior in extent to thofeo
the Mexican monarch . Each of these polleled
complete territorial juriflidion , and levied taxes
from their own vassals. But all followed the stand
ard of Mexico in war, serving with a number o
men in proportion to their domain, and moll o
them paid tribute to its monarch as their fuprio
lord.

In tracing those great lines of the Mexican con- B o o it

rigid form rifes to view, and we discern its three
distinguishing characterifics, a nobility poffefling
almolt independent authority, a people deprefted
into the lowest state of fubjedion , and a king in-
trusted with the executive power of the state. Its
ipirit and principles seem to have operated in the
New \World in the fame manner, as in the ancient.
Thejurifdidtion of the crown was extremely limit-
ed. All real and effective authority was retained
by the Mexican nobles in their own hands, and the
hadow of it only left to the king. Jealous to ex-
cess of their own rights, they guarded with mofl
:igilant anxiety against the encroachments of their
overeigns. By a fundamental law of the empire,
twas provided that the king hould not determine
oncerning any point of general importance, with-
ut the approbation of a council composed of the
rime nobility `. Unless he obtained their consent
ecould not engage the nation in war, nor could

Chiefs of Tczeuco and Tacuba were always two.
From refpe-t for the family of their monarchs, the
choice fell generally upon some person fprunz
from it. But as the activity and valor of their
prince were of greater moment to a people perpe-
tually engaged in war, than a ftrid adherence to
the order of birth , collaterals of mature age or of
diftinguilhed merit were often preferred to those
who were nearer the throne in diret dlefcent ". To
this maxim in their policy, the Mexicans appear
to be indebted for such a succession of able and
warlike princes, as raised their empire in a short
period to that extraordinary height of power,
which it had attained when Cortes landed in New
Spain.

their mo.

their authority became more extensive, the fplen.
dor of their government augmented. It was in
this laPt state that the Spaniards beheld it; and
struck with the appearance of Montezuma's court,
they efcribc its pomp at great length , and with
much admiration. The number of his attendants,

which hath contributed more than all others to the vrr.
improvement of the species, were very rude, and
it advanced towards perfecion slowly, and by a
Fradnal progreflion. WVhen the warrior, eager
or fame, wished to transmit some knowledge of
is exploits to succeeding ages; when the grati-
tul of a people to their sovereign prompted them
o hand down an account of his beneficent deeds
to posterity; the first method of accomplishing
hi, that seems to have occurred to them, was to
]lineatc, in the belt manner they could, figures
eprefenting the ation of which they were folici-
nlns to preserve the memory. Of this, which has
erv properly been called picture-uwriting '", we find
races among some of the most savage tribes of
merica. When a leader returns from the field,
c trips a tree of its bark, and with red paint
itcheles upon it some uncouth figures, which re-
refcnt the order of his march, the number of his
llowers, the enemy whom he attacked, the scalps
nd captives which he brought home. To those

vided into three parts. The first contains th
history of the Alexican empire under its ten n
narchs. The second is a tribute-roll, reprefentin
what each conquered town paid into the roy
treaftry. The third is a code of their institutions
domestic, political, and military. Another spec
ncen of Mexican painting has been published
thirty-two plates, by the present archbiflop
Tolcdo. To both are annexed a full explanatio
of what the figures were intended to reprefen
wvhich was obtained by the Spaniards from In(li

therefore, be confidered as the earliest and most n o o K
imperfed essay of men in their progress towards vir.
discovering the art of writing. The defects in
this mode of recording tranfadtions muff have been
early felt. To paint every occurrence was, from
its nature, a very tedious operation; and as affairs
became more complicated, and events multiplied
in any society, its annals muff have swelled to an
enormous bulk. Besides this, no objects could
be delineated but those of sense; the conceptions
of the mind had no corporeal form, and as long
as piture-writing could not convey an idea of these,
it muff have been a very imperfect art. The ne-
ceffity of improving it must have roused and' harp-
ened invention, and the human mind holding the
fame course in the NewV World as in the Old,
might have advanced by the fame fucceflive steps,
first, from an atual pidcure to the plain hierogly-
phic; next, to the allegorical symbol; then to the
arbitrary charadter; until, at length, an alphabet
of letters was discovered, capable of expressing al
the various combinations of found employed in
peech. In the paintings of the Mexicans we, ac-
cordingly, perceive, that this progress was begun
mong them. Upon an attentive infpedion of the
lates, which I have mentioned, we may observe
ome approach to the plain or simple hieroglyphic,
vherc some principal part or circumstance in the
ubject is made to tand for the whole. In the an-
als of their kings, publifled by Purchas, the
owns conquered by each are uniformly represented
n the fame manner by a rude delineation of ;t

B o house; but in order to point out the particular

vii. towns which submitted to their vitorious arms,

peculiar emblems, sometimes natural objets, and
sometimes artificial figures, are employed. In the
tribute-roll, published by the archbilhop of To.
ledo, the house , which was properly the picture of
the town, is omitted, and the emblem alone is
employed to represent it. The Mexicans seem
even to have made some advances beyond this,
towards the use of the more figurative and fanciful
hieroglyphic. In order to describe a monarch,
who had enlarged his dominions by force of arms,
they painted a target ornamented with darts, and
placed it between him and those towns which he
,subdued. But it is only in one instance, the no.
tation of numbers, that we discern any attemptto
exhibit ideas which had no corporeal form. The
Mexican painters had invented artificial marks, or
J7qns of convention, for this purpose. By means of
these, they computed the years of their kings
reigns, as well as the amount of tribute to be
paid into the royal treafiry. The figure of a
circle represented unit, and in small numbers, the
computation was made by repeating it. Larger
numbers were expressed by a peculiar mark, nd
they had such as denoted all integral numbers,
from twenty to eight thousand. The short dura
tion of their empire prevented the Mexicans from
advancing farther in that long course which con.
ducts men from the labor of delineating real ob
jecs, to the simplicity and cafe of alphabetic
writing. Their records, notwithltanding some dawn

of such ideas as might have led to a more perfec n o o K
fyle, can be conlidered as little more than a species vii.
of picture -writing, so far improved as to mark their
superiority over the savage tribes of America; but
fill so defective, as to prove that they had not pro-
ceeded far beyond the first fpage in that progress
which mut be completed before any people can be
anked among polified nations .
Their mode of computing time may be confi- Thcirmode
ered as a more decisive evidence of their progress "oco'iit

n improvement. They divided their year into
ighteen months, each confirling of twenty days,
mounting in all to three hundred and sixty. But
sthey observed that the course of the fun was not
ompleted in that time, they added five days to
e year. These, which were properly intercalary
ays, they termed fupernumernry or wafle; and as
hey did not belong to any month, no work was
one, and no sacred rite performed on them; they
ere devoted wholly to festivity and pastime . This
ear approach to philosophical accuracy is a re.
,rkable proof that the Mexicans had bestowed some
ttention upon inquiries and speculations, to which
en in a very rude state never turn their thoughts ".

gratify their vengeance, by shedding the blood of
their enemies. In battle they were chiefly intent
on taking prisoners, and it was by the numberof
these that they estimated the glory of vidtory. No
captive was ever ransomed or spared. All were
sacrificed without mercy, and their flesh devoured
with the fame barbarous joy as among the fierce
savages. On fomc occasions it rose to even wilde
excesses. Their principal warriors covered them,
selves with the skins of the unhappy victims, an
danced about the streets, boafling of their own va

tercourfe was carried on by barter, and their igno

butes so much towards the comfort of life, may
justly mentioned as an evidence of the infant fat
of their policy. But even in the New World th
inconvenience of wanting some general inflrume
of commerce began to be felt, and some effor
were made towards supplying that defed. Th
Mlexicans, among whom the number and greatne
of their cities gave rife to a more extended co

employ a common itandard of value, which re
dered fnaller tranfations much more easy. A

consumption, that, in their stated markets, the

what one wished to dispose of, was estimated byth
number of nuts of the cacao, which he mighte
lpet in exchange for it. This seems to be theu

Bo o t appear to be highly embelliffied. There is not a more

Vit. frequent or a more fertile source of deception in de.

scribing the manners and arts of savage nations, or
of such as are imperfectly civilized , than that of ap.
plying to them the names and phrases appropriated
to the institutions and refinements of polished life,
WVhen the leader of a finall tribe, or the head o
a rude community, is dignified with the name o
king or emperor, the place of his residence can
receive no other name but that of his palace; and
wvhateverahis attendants may be, they must be called
his court. Under such appellations they acquire
in our estimation , an importance and dignity which
does not belong to them. The illusion spreads,
and giving a false color to every part of the nar.
rative, the imagination is so much carried away
with the resemblance, that it becomes difficult to
discern objects as they really are. The Spaniards,
when they first touched on the Mexican coast,
were so much firuck with the appearance of attain.
ments in policy and in the arts of life, far superior
to those of the rude tribes with which they were
hitherto acquainted, that they fancied they had
at length difcovcred a civilized people in theNew
World. This comparison between the people of
Mexico and their uncultivated neighbours, they ap.
pear to have kept constantly in view, and observing
with admiration many things which marked the pre.
eminence of the former, they employ in defcribilg
their imperfect policy and infant arts, such terms
as arc applicable to the infitutions of men far be.
yond them in improvement. Both these circum.

ances concur in detracting from the credit due to n o
e descriptions of Mexican manners by the early vil.
panifh writers. By drawing a parallel between
hem and those of people so much less civilized,
ey raied their own ideas too high. Btheirheir mode
fdefcribing them, they conveyed ideas to others
olefs exalted above truth. Later writers have
dopted the style of the original historians, and im-
roved upon it. The colors with which De Solis
elineates the characder and describes the ations of
lontezuma, the splendor of his court, the laws
d policy of his empire, are the fame that he muff
ave employed in exhibiting to view the monarch
d institutions of a highly polilhed people.
But though we may admit, that the warm ima-
nation of the Spanih writers has added some
bellifhment to their descriptions, this will not
lify the decisive and peremptory tone, with
hich several authors pronounce all their accounts
the Mexican power, policy and laws, to be the

hted in the marvellous. There are few hiflorical

vi1. testimony. Had Cortes ventured to impose upon

his sovereign, by exhibiting to him a picture of
imaginary manners, there wanted not enemies an
rivals who were qualified to detect his deceit, an
who would have rejoiced in exposing it. But a
cording to the jufremark of an author, whose in
genuity has illustrated, and whose eloquence ha
adorned, the history of America4", this fuppofitio
is in itself as improbable, as the attempt woul
have been audacious. Who among the deftroye
of this great empire was so enlightened by fcienc
or so attentive to the progress and operations
men in social life, as to frame a fidtitious system
policy so well combined and so consistent, as th
which they delineate, in their accounts of th
Mexican government? Where could they hay
borrowed the idea of many institutions in legil
tion and police, to which, at that period, the
was nothing parallel in the nations with which th
were acquainted ? There wasnot, at thebeginni
of the sixteenth century, a regular eftablifhmei
of polts for conveying intelligence to the foverei
of any kingdom in Europe. The fame obfervatio

nations, will often, at very early stages of it, discover R o o U
a premature and unexpeced dawn of those ideas, Vil.
which give rife to inflitutions that are the pride
and ornament of its most advanced period. Even
ina state as imperfectly polilhed as the Mexican
empire, the happy genius of some sagacious ob-
[erver, excited or aided by circumstances unknown
to us, may have introduced institutions which are
eldom found but in societies highly refined. But
it is almost ipoffible that the illiterate conquerors
of the New World should have formed in any one
inltance a conception of customs and laws, beyond
the fandard of improvement in their own age
nd country. Or if Cortes had been capable of
his, what inducement had those by whom he was
superseded to continue the deception ? Why should
orita, or Motolinea, or Acofta, have amused
heir sovereign or their fellow citizens with a tale
urely fabulous ?
In one particular, however, the guides whom Religion of

e more barbarous, perhaps, than they really were.
heir religious tenets, and the rites of their wor-

oonfiderable place in the thoughts of a savage,
whose conceptions of any superior power are ob-
cure, and his sacred rites few as well as fimplc,
was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular
yftem, with its complete train of priets, temples,
vidims, and fftivals. This, of itself, is a clear
proof that the fate of the Mexicans was very

B o o i different from that of the ruder American tribes,

VIl. But from the extravagance of their religious no.

tions, or the barbarity of their rites, no conclusion
can be drawn with certainty concerning the degree
of their civilization. For nations, long after their
ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to refine,
adhere to systems of superstition founded on the
crude conceptions of early ages. From the genius
of the Mexican religion we may, however, form
a molt just conclusion with refped to its influence
upon the characer of the people. The afpe of
fuperition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious,
Its divinities were clothed with terror, and de-
lighted in vengeance. They were exhibited to the
people under detetable forms, which created hor.
ror. The figures of serpents, of tigers, and of
other deftruCive animals, decorated their temples.
Fear was the only principle that inspired their vo.
taries. Fasts, mortifications, and penances, allri-
gid, and many of them excruciating to an ex.
treme degree, were the means employed to appease
the wrath of their gods, and the Mexicans never
approached their altars without sprinkling them
with blood drawn from their own bodies. But, of
all offerings, human sacrifices were deemed the
nmolt acceptable. This religious belief, mingling
with the implacable spirit of vengeance, andadding
new force to it, every captive taken in war was
brought to the temple, was devoted as a victim to
the deity, and sacrificed with rites no less solemn
than cruel . The heart and head were the portion

she spirit of the Mexicans was accordingly un-
eeling, and the genius of their religion so far
ounterbalanced the influence of policy and arts,
tht notwithstanding their progress in both, their
anners, instead of softening, became more fierce.
o what circumstances it was owing that super-
tiion assumed such a dreadful form among the
lexicans, we have notfufficient knowledge of their
history to determine. But its influence is visible,
id produced an effect that is singular in the history
f the human species. The manners of the people
n the New World who had made the greatest
rogrefs in the arts of policy, were the most
erocious, and the barbarity of some of theircuftoms
xceeded even those of the savage state.

as insults offered to the Deity. Each, without

the trespass with inevitable certainty, because

ferocious and desperate, would be more apt
ltiply crimes than to restrain them. But the

Milndenius The system of superstition on which the Inc
ofrlirrc. ingrafted their pretensions to such high authority

was of a genius very different from that eftablilc
among the Mexicans. Manco Capac turned th
veneration of his followers entirely towards natu
objects. The Sun, as the great source of light,
joy, and fertility in the creation, attracted th
principal homage. The Moon and Stars, as
operating with him, were entitled to fecondaryh
nors. Wherever the propensity in the hum
mind to acknowledge and to adore some fuperi
power, takes this direcion, and is employed
contemplating the order and beneficence that real
exist in nature, the spirit of superstition is mil
Wherever imaginary beings, created by the fan
and the fears of men, are supposed to preside
nature, and become the objeds of worship,
perdition always assumes a more severe and at
cious form. Of the latter we have an exam
among the Mexicans, of the former among
people of Peru. The Peruvians had not, i
deed, made such progress in obfcrvation or
quiry, as to have attained julf conceptions oft

per nane or appellation of the Supremne owe
which intimated, that they had formed any idea

ut by directing their veneration to that glorious VII.
minary, which, by its universal and vivifying
ergy, is the test emblem of divine beneficence,
e rites and observances which they deemed ac-
ptable to him were innocent and humane. They
ercd to the Sun a part of those productions
hich his genial warmth had called forth from the
sorn of the earth, and reared to maturity. They
criiced, as an oblation of gratitude, some of the
imals who were indebted to his influence for

mens of those works of ingenuity which his light
(I guided the hand of man in forming. But the
cas never stained his altars with human blood,
r could they conceive that their beneficent father
e Sun would be delighted with such horrid vic-

". Thus the Peruvians, unacquainted with

ofe barbarous rites which extinguish sensibility,

man sufferings, were formed, by the spirit of

nal character, more gentle than that of any

and on their Even the wars in which the Incas engaged, ve
i[iltary carried on with a spirit very different from thi

of other American nations. 'lhey fought not, li

Mexicans, to glut blood-thirsty divinities \vi

Prisoners seem not to have been exposed t th

muff be ascribed, like other peculiarities which v
have obfcrved in the Peruvian manners, to ti

[enius of their religion. The Incas, confidering the n o o K
homage paid to any other object than to the VII.
lheavenly powers which they adored as impious,
vere fond of gaining proselytes to their favorite
fyflem. The idols of every conquered province
vere carried in triumph to the great temple at
Cuzco ', and placed there as trophies of the
superior power of the divinity who was the
protecor of the empire: The people were treated
with lenity, and inftrudted in the religious tenets
f their new masters , that the conqueror might
have the glory of having added to the number
f the votaries of his father the Sun.

The state of property in Peru was no refs Peculiar

ingular than that of religion, and contributed, flatt of pr"o
ikcwife, towards giving a mild turn of character P
o the people. All the lands capable of cultivation
vere divided into three shares. One was confe-
rated to the Sun, and the product of it was
pplied to the eredion of temples, and furnishing
hat was requisite towards celebrating the public
ites of religion. The second belonged to the
nca, and was set apart as the provision made by
the community for the support of government.

maintenance of the people, among whom it was

of cultivating it, the idea of a common intere,

those around him, and knew that he depended
ors their friendly aid for what increase he was to
reap. A slate thus constituted may be confidered
as one great family, in which the union of the
members was so complete, and the exchange o
good offices so perceptible, as to create trongel

Inequality But, though the institutions of the Incas were

among their fubjedts, there was great inequality i"
their condition. The dillindion of ranks was fully
eft.blifhed in Peru. A great body of the inhabitants,

o o r their houses were very properly of a fabric extre.
vil. mely flight. But in the higher regions, where rain

falls, where the vicissitude of seasons is known
and their rigor felt, houses were conftruced with
greater solidity. They were generally of a square
form, the walls about eight feet high, built with
bricks hardened in the fun, without any windows,
and the door low and strait. Simple as these ftruc
tures were, and rude as the materials may seem
to be, of which they were formed, they were
so durable, that many of them still fubfit in
different parts of Peru, long after every monument
that might have conveyed to us any idea of the
domestic state of the other American nations has
vanished from the face of the earth. But it was
in the temples consecrated to the Sun, and in
the buildings destined for the residence of their
monarchs, that the Peruvians displayed the utmof
extent of their art and contrivance. The defcrip.
tions of them by such of the Spanish writers as
had an opportunity of contemplating them, while,
in ome meafurc, entire, might have appeared
highly exaggerated, if the ruins which frill remain,
did not vouch the truth of their relations. These
ruins of sacred or royal buildings are found in
every province of the empire, and by their fre.
quency (lemonftrate that they are monuments of
a powerful people, who must have fubfited,
during a period of some extent, in a state of no
inconsiderable improvement. They appear to have
been edifices various in their dimensions. Some of
a moderate size, many of immense extent, all

emarkable for solidity, and resembling each other o o

amac, together with a palace of the Inca, and a
rtrefs, were so connected together as to form
ne great ftrudure, above half a league in circuit.
n this prodigious pile, the fame singular taste in
nilding is conspicuous, as in other works of the
cruvians. As they were unacquainted with the
fe of the pulley, and.other mechanical powers,
nd could not elevate the large stones and bricks
hich they employed in building to any confider-
ble height, the walls of this edifice, in which they
em to have made their greatest effort towards
agnificence, did not rife above twelve feet from
he ground. Though they had not discovered the
fe of mortar or of any other cement in building,
he bricks or stones were joined with so much
icety, that the seams can hardly be discerned ".
he apartments, as far as the distribution of them
an be traced in the ruins, were ill-difpofed, and
forded little accommodation. There was not a
ngle window in any part of the building; and
s no light could enter but by the door, all the
partments of largest dimension must either have
een perfectly dark, or illuminated by some othet
eans. But with all these, and many other imper-
edions that might be mentioned in their art of

remain, must be confidered as stupendous efforts
of a people unacquainted with the use of iron,

Theirpublic These, however, were not the noblest or rmon
roads, useful works of the Incas. The two great roadl

from Cuzco to Quito, extending in an uninter
rupted stretch above fifteen hundred miles, are
entitled to ill higher- praise. The one was con
duded through the interior and mountainous
country, the other through the plains on the
sea-coast. From the language of admiration in
which some of the early writers express their
aftonifiment when they sirs viewed those roads,
and from the more pompous descriptions of later
writers, who labor to support some favorite theory
concerning America, one might be led to compare
this work of the Incas to the famous military ways
which remain as monuments of the Roman power.
But in a country where there was no tame animal
except the Llama, which was never used for
draught, and but little as a beast of burden, where
the high roads were seldom trod by 'any but a
human foot, no great degree of labor or art was
requisite in 'forming them. The Peruvian roads
were only fifteen feet in breadth ', and in many
places so slightly formed , that time has effaced
every veflige of the course in which they ran. In
the low country little more seens to have been
done, than to plant trees or to fix polls at certain
intervals, in order to mark the proper route to
travellers. To open a path through the mountain'

and bridges. The formation of those roads introduced anoth

improvement in Peru equally unknown over
the reft of America. In its course from south
north, the road of the Incas was interfeded by
the torrents which roll from the Andes towar
the WVeftern Ocean. From the rapidity of th
course, as well as from the frequency and violen
of their inundation, these were unnavigable. So
expedient, however, was to be found for pati
them. The Peruvians, from their unacquainta
with the use of arches, and their inability to wo
in wood, could not conftrud bridges either
stone or timber. But necessity, the parent
invention, suggested a device which supplied th
defeA. They formed cables of great strength,
twiling together some of the pliable withs
osiers, with which their country abounds; f
of these cables they stretched across the ftrea
parallel to one another, and made them faif
each fide. These they bound firmly together
interweaving smaller ropes so close, as to form
compact piece of net-work, which being covere
with branches of trees and earth, they passed alonl

for labor. Some were of flint, some of copper,

nations of America opposed their invaders wit
undaunted ferocity, though with little conduct or
success. The Mlexicans maintained the struggle in
defence of their liberties, with such perfeverin
fortitude, that it was with difficulty the Spaniard
triumphed over them. Peru was subdued at once,
and almolt without resistance; and the most favor
able opportunities of regaining their freedom, an
of crushing their oppressors, were loft through th
timidity of the people. Though the traditiona

principle in their government, unknown to us, was
the occasion of this political debility. Whatever
may have been the cause, the fad is certain, and
there is not an instance in history of any people so
little advanced in refinement, so totally destitute of
military enterprise. This charadter hath descended
to their posterity. The Indians of Peru are now
more tame and depressed than any people of Ame-
rica. Their feeble spirits, relaxed in lifeless in-
adion, seem hardly capable of any bold or manly
exertion.

But, besides those capital defecs in the poli-
tical state of Peru, some detached circumstances
and fads occur in the Spanilh writers, which dif-
cover a considerable remainder of barbarity in their
manners. A cruel custom, that prevailed in some of
tie molt savage tribes, subsisted among the Peru-
vians. On the death of the Incas, and of other emi-
nent perfors, a considerable number of their at-
tendants was put to death, and interred around their
Guacas, that they might appear in the next world
with their former dignity, and be served with the
fame refped. On the death of Huana-Capac, the
noft powerful of their monarchs, above a thousand
vicims were doomed to accompany him to the
tomb". In one particular, their manners appear
to have been more barbarous than those of moRt

plied to the Marquis de Croix, viceroy of Mexi
for such a body of troops as might enable them

rough defiles which were almost impassable, it

inated, in the year 1771, in the final fubmiflion
the tribes, which had been so long the object of

ice, the Spaniards marched through countries
owhich they seem not to have penetrated before
attime, and discovered mines offuch value, as was
onihing even to men acquainted with the riches
ntained in the mountains of the New World. At
eguilla, in the province of Sonora, they entered
ain of fourteen leagues in extent, in which, at
depth of only sixteen inches, they found gold in
ins of such a size, that some of them weighed
marks, and in such quantities, that in a fiort
e, with a few laborers, they collected a thousand
rksof gold in grains, even without taking time to

befo rich, that persons of skill computed that it

B o o account of tlis northern division, until I enter upun

it is intimately connetel; and, in relating it, I
ilall be able from authentic mat'erials , supplicd
both by Spain and Portugal , to give a full and
accurate defcripion of the operations and views of
the Jcfuits, in rearing that iingular fabric of po.
licy in America, which has drawn so much atten.
tion, and has been so imperfectly underltood. The
latter division of the province contains the govern.
ments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, and to theft
I f iall at present confine my observations.

Viewofthe The Spaniards entered this part of America by
latter. the river De la Plata; and though a succession of,

cruel disasters besel them in their early attempts to
establish their dominion in it, they were encouraged
to persist in the design , at first by the hopes of dif
covering mines in the interior cotntry, and after,
wards by the necessity of occupying it, in order to
prevent any other nation from fettling there, and
penetrating by this route into their rich poffcllioin
in Peru. But except at Buenos-Ayres, tecy hve
made no settlement of any consequence in all the
vast space which I have mentioned. There are
indeed , scattered over it, a few places on which
they have belowed the name of towns , and t
which they have endeavoured to add some dignityl
by ercdting them into bifloprics; but they are no
better than paltry villages, each with two or thre
hundred inhabitants. One circumfnance , how
cver , which was not originally foreseen, has co
tribeted to render this dillri , though thini

peopled, of considerable importance. Tle pro- Bn 0 r;
vince of Tucuman , together with the country to VIX.
the south of the Plata , instead of being covered
with wood like other parts of America, forms one
vast open plain , almolt without a tree. The foil
ii a deep fertile mould , watered by many fireams
descending from the Andes, and clothed in per-
pCtual verdure. In this rich pafltrage, the horses
and cattle imported by the Spaniards fr-om Europe
have multiplied to a degree which almost exceeds
belief. This has enabled the inhabitants not only
to open a lucrative trade with Peru, by supplying
t wvith cattle, horses, and mules, but to carry on
commerce no less beneficial, by the exportation
fhides to Europe. From both, the colony'has ,
erived great advantages. But its commodious
uation for carrying on contraband trade, has
en the chief source of its prosperity. Whiie the
ourt of Madrid adhered to its ancient fyfte , with
esped to its communication with America, the
iver De la Plata lay so much out of the course of
panifli navigation, that interlopers, almost with-
ut any rifque of bcing either observed' or ob-
ruided, could pour in European manufacures in
ucl quantities , thalt they not only f)pplied tlh
ants of the colony , but were conveyed into all
he ealtern diflrids of Peru. When the Pbrtu-
nefe in Brasil, extended their settlements to the
nks of Rio de la Plata, a new channel'was
pened, by which prohibited commodities flowed
to the Spanish territories, with flill more facility,
din greater abundance. This illegal trafic,

Cn?,tlo Ximenes de Quefada, two of the bra

anded at that time in Quito, attacked it from n o
e south; the latter made his invasion from Santa vii.
artha on the north. As the original inhabitants
this region were farther advanced in improve-
ent, than any people in America but the Mlexi-
,s and Peruvians ", they defended themselves
ith great resolution and good conduct. The
l:itles and perseverance of Benalcazar and Que-
da urmounted all opposition, though not with-
t encountcring many dangers , and reduced the
untry into the form of a Spanih province.
The New Kingdom of Granada is so far ele-
ted above the level of the sea, that though it
proaches almost to the equator , the climate is
markably temperate. The fertility of its vallieS
not inferior to that of the richest diftrits in
erica, and its higher grounds yield gold and
ecious stones of various kinds. It is not by

found; it is mingled with the foil near the fur-

sensibly felt. All these were occupied either
wandering tribes of hunters, or by such as
made but small progress in cultivation and

masters to take up a fixed reidlence, and to a
to regular labor; when talks were imposed

exaded with unrelenting severity, they poss
not vigor either of mind or of body to sustain
unusual load of oppression. Dcjedtion and de

latter was a permanent evil, which, with gra-
al consumption, wafted the nation. When the
vinces of Mexico and Peru were divided among
conquerors, each was eager to obtain a dif-

ous recompence for all his services. Soldiers,
ulomed to the carelessness and dissipation of a
itary life, had neither indufiry to carry on any
of regular cultivation, nor patience to wait
its flow, but certain returns. Instead of set-
gin the vallies occupied by the natives, where
fertility of the foil would have amply rewarded
diligence of the planter, they chore to fix their
tions in some of the mountainous regions, fre-
ent both in New Spain and in Peru. To search
mines of gold and silver, was the chief object
their activity. The profpecs which this opens,
the alluring hopes which it continually pre-
ts, correspond wonderfully with the firit of
terprife and adventure that animated the firll

the New World became so extensive, as might hav

that when towns were built, and formed into bo-

laid whatever intelligence, either public or fe- viii.
et, is received from America, and every scheme
improving the adminiltration, the police, or the
ommerce of the colonies, is ubmitted to its con-
eration. From the first institution of the coun-
of the Indies, it has been the conflant object of
e catholic monarchs to maintain its authority,
d to make such additions from time to time,
oth to its power and its splendor, as might render
formidable to all their fubjeds in the New
orld. Whatever degree of public order and
irtue flill remains in that country, where so many
rcumftances conspire to relax the former, and to

re to the wife regulations and vigilant infpedtion

rcial affairs as required the immediate and per.
nal infpedion of those appointed to superintend

house of trade, and was established in Seville,

Such is the great outline of that system of

vernment, which Spain has established in
American colonies. To enumerate the vari

administration of justice, in collecting the pu
revenue, and in regulating the interior police of

to inquire into the mode and effect of their ope

to secure all secure the producions of the colonies to the par

inion over such vast regions, or in retaining so vII.
any reluctant nations under the yoke, they dread-
the intrusion of firangers; they even shunned
eir inspection, and endeavoured to keep them at
dilfince from their coasts. This spirit of jea-
ufy and exclusion, which at first was natural,
d perhaps necessary , augmented as their poses-
onsin America extended , and the value of them
me to be more fully underltood. In consequence
it, a system of colonizing was introduced, to which
ere had hitherto been nothing similar among man.
ind In the ancient world, it was not uncom-
on to fend forth colonies. But they were of two
nds only. They were either migrations, which
rvcd to disburden a late of its superfluous sub-
ds, when they multiplied too fast for the terri-
ry which they occupied: or they were military
tachments stationed, as garrisons, in a conquered
ovince. The colonies of some Greek republics,
d the swarms of northern barbarians which fettled
different parts of Europe, were of the first fpccies.
he Roman colonies were of the second. In the
rmer, the connexion with the mother-country
ickly ceased, and they became independent states.
the latter, as the disjunction was not complete,
e dependence continued. In their American Rcgnlatioil
tlrnents, the Spanifli monarchs took what was fortl'l"
culiar to each, and studied to unite them. By p
(ding colonies to regions so remote, by eltablilh,
gin each a form of interior policy and adminif-
101on, under diltindt govcrnol , and witli put;uiia

B o liar laws, they disjoined them from the mothe

rights of legislation, as well as that of impofil
taxes, together with the power of nominating [
persons who filled every department of executiveg(
vernment, civil or military, they secured tird
pendence upon the parent state. Happily for Spaii
the situation of her colonies was such, as rendered
possible to reduce this new idea into pradtice. A
most all the countries which file had discovered an
occupied, lay within the tropics. The produdior

extensive commerce and flourishing manufac-

her colonies, from her own llores. The pro

change for there. But all that the colonies re.
ivel, as well as all that they gave, was con^

e colonies was ever permitted to carry the com-
odiies of America to Europe. Even the comr

y jealous reftridions. All that America yields

undlamental maxim of policy; and, as they pof.
[fed power, which enabled them to gratify the

'as. By degrees they obtained the privilege of
nverting a part of these into Mayorafqos, a
cies of fief, introduced into the Spaniih system

vidcd nor alienated. Thus a great portion of
nded property, under this rigid form of en-
il, is withheld from circulation, and descends
on father to son unimproved, and of little

ample provision which has been made for t
American church, many of its members enjoy t
ease and independence which are favorable to t
cultivation of science, the body of secular cler
has hardly , during two centuries and a hal
produced one author whose works convey fu
;useful information, or possess such a degree
merit, as to be ranked among those which attra
oftheregu. the attention of enlightened nations. But thegreat

ar'. part of the ecclesiastics in the Spanish fettleme

are regulars. On the discovery of America, a ne
field opened to the pious zeal of the mona
orders; and, with a becoming alacrity, th
immediately fcnt forth mifionaries to labor
it. The firlt attempt to ilftrudt and convert
Americans, was made by monks; and, as so
as the conquest of any province was complete
and its ccclefiaftical eftahliflment began to afi
some form, the popes permitted the mifnionar
of the four mendicant ordcrs, as a reward for tb

services, to accept of parochial charges in America, B o it
to perform all spiritual fundions, and to receive vIIr.
the tithes, and other emoluments of the benefice,
without depending on the jurifdidtion of the bishop
of the diocese, or being subjed to his censures.
n consequence of this, a new career of usefulness,
as well as new objects of ambition presented
themselves. Whenever a call is made for a frelh
fpply of missionaries, men of the most ardent
and aspiring minds, impatient under the restraint
of a cloister, weary of its insipid uniformity, and
fatigued with the irksome repetition of its frivolous
funcions, offer their service with eagerness, and
repair to the New World in quest of liberty and
difRindion. Nor do they pursue diflindion without
success. The highest ecclesiastical honors, as well
as the most lucrative preferments in Mexico and
Peru, are often in the hands of regulars; and it is
chiefly to the monastic orders that the Americans
are indebted for any portion of science which is
cultivated among them. They are almost the only
Spanish ecclesiastics, from whom we have received
any accounts, either of the civil or natural history
of the various provinces in America. Some of
them, though deeply tinged with the indelible
fuperflition of their profelfion, have publishcd
books which give a favorable idea of their abili-
ties. The natural and moral history of the New
rorl , by the Jesuit Acofta, contains more
accurate obfcrvations, perhaps, and more fiond
science, than are to be found in any dcfcription

different character. The giddy, the profligate,
the avaricious, to whom the poverty and rigid
discipline of a convent are intolerable, confider a
mission to America as a release from mortification
and bondage. There they soon obtain some
parochial charge, and far removed , by their
situation, from the infpetion of their monastic
superiors, and exempt, by their character, from
the jurifdidtion of their diocesan "7, they are
hardly subject to any control. According to the
testimony of the most zealous catholics, many of
the regular clergy in the Spanifi settlements are
not only destitute of the virtues becoming their
profession, but regardless of that external decorum
and refped for the opinion of mankind, which
preserve a semblance of worth, where the reality
is wanting. Secure of impunity, some regulars, in
contempt of their vow of poverty, engage openly
in commerce; and are so rapaciously eager in
amafling wealth, that they become the molt
grievous oppressors of the Indians, whom it was
their duty to have protcded. Others, with no
less flagrant violation of their vow of chastity,
indulge with little disguise in lhec most diflblutc
licentiousness".

Various schemes have been proposed for redref- n o o K
ig enormities so manifest and so offensive. Several vil1.

to the present moment, and ingroffed by the

and while their foresight rarely extends so far as
the next day, it is almost impossible to inspire
them with solicitude about the concerns of a
future world. Astonished equally at their slowness
of comprehension , and at their insensibility, some
of the early missionaries pronounced them a race
of men so brutish, as to be incapable of understand-
ing the first principles of religion. A council held
at Lima decreed, that, on account of this inca-

opulence pours in suddenly, and with too full a

brings along with it a taste for what is wild and

Such was the great and sudden augmentation
of power and revenue, that the possession of
America brought into Spain, and some symptoms
of its pernicious influence upon the political opera-
tions of that monarchy soon began to appear. For
iconfiderable time, however, the supply of trea-
fre from the New World was scanty and preca-
rinus, and the genius of Charles V. conducted
public measures with such prudence, that the effedts
of this influence were little perceived. But when

viii. far inferior to those of his father, and remittances

from the colonies became a regular and confider.
able branch of revenue, the fatal operation of this
rapid change in the lrate of the kingdom, both on
the monarch and his people, was at once confpi.
cuous. Philip, poffelling that spirit of unceasing
atfiduitv, which often charaterizes the ambition of
men of moderate talents, entertained such a high
opinion of his own resources, that he thought no.
thing too arduous for him to undertake. Shut up
himself in the olitude of the Escurial, he troubled
and annoyed all the nations around him. He
waged open war with the Dutch and English; he
encouraged and aided a rebellious faction in
France; he conquered Portugal, and maintained
armies and garrisons in Italy, Africa, and both
the Indies. By filch a multiplicity of great and
complicated opeiations, pursued with ardor during
the course of a long reign, Spain was drained
both of men and money. Under the weak
administration of his fcceffor, Philip III. th
vigor of the nation continued to decrease, and

revive its lftrcigth. Early in the cvcnteenth cen

armies, she was obliged to contrad her operations. B o o KT
Her flourishing manufatures were fallen into de- vII.
cay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all
Europe, were ruined. Her extensive foreign com-
merce was loft. The trade between different parts
of her own dominions was interrupted, and the
;lips which attempted to carry it on, were taken
and plundered by enemies whom [he once de-
spifed. Even agriculture, the primary objed of
indflry in every prosperous state, was neglected,
and one of the most fertile countries in Europe
hardly raised what was sufficient for the support of
its own inhabitants.
In proportion as the population and manufac- Rapil de.

her colonies continued to increase. The Spaniards, trde
like their monarchs, intoxicated with the wealth
which poured in annually upon them, deserted the
paths of industry, to which they had been accuf-
tomed, and repaired with eagerness to those
regions from which this opulence issued. By this
rage of emigration , another drain was opened, and
the flrength of the colonies augmented by exhaust-

than any statute, defeated its operations, an
constrained the Spaniards themselves to concu

ment to every branch of manufacture, flowed out
of the kingdom with such a rapid course, as neither
enriched nor animated it. On the other hand, the
artisans of rival nations, encouraged by this quick
sale of their commodities, improved so much in.
Ikill and industry, as to be able to afford them at
arate so low, that the manufactures of Spain,
which could not vie with theirs, either in quality
or cheapness of work, were till farther depressed.
This deftrudive commerce drained off the riches
of the nation faster and more completely, than
even the extravagant schemes of ambition carried
on by its monarchs. Spain was so much astonish-
ed and distressed, at beholding her American trea-
fures vanish almost as soon as they were imported,
that Philip III. unable to supply what was requisite
in circulation, issued an edidt, by which he endea-
voured to raise copper money to a value in cur-
rency nearly equal to that of silver ' ; and the lord
of the Peruvian and Mexican mines was reduced
to a wretched expedient, which is the last resource
of petty impoverilhed states.

E o o Thus the poffeflions of Spain in America have

viII. not proved a source of population and of wealth

to her, in the fame manner as those of other na.
tions. In the countries of Europe, where the fpi.
rit of industry subsists in full vigor, every per.
son fettled in filch colonies as are similar in their
situation to those of Spain is fippofed to give em-
ployment to three or four at home in supplying
his wants 9'. But wherever the mother-country can-
not afford this supply, every emigrant may be con-
fidered as a citizen loft to the community, and
strangers must reap all the benefit of answering his
demands.

increaredy Such has been the internal slate of Spain from
themodeof the close of the sixteenth century , and such her
regulating its
intercourse inability to supply the growing wants of her colo-
withAme- nies. The fatal effects of this disproportion be.

rca. tween their demands, and her capacity of answer-

ing them, have been much increased by the mode
in which Spain has endeavoured to regulate the in-
tercourfe between the mother country and the co-
lonies. It is from her idea of monopolizing the
trade with America, and debarring her fubjets
there from any communication with foreigners, that
all her jealous and systematic arrangements have
arifcn. I lefC are so singular in their nature and
confequcnces as to merit a particular explanation.
In order to secure the monopoly at which he aimed,
Spain did not vect the trade with her colonies in an
exclusive company, a plan which has been adopted

Child, on trade and culonics.,

by nations more commercial, and at a period when B o o E
mercantile policy was an objedt of greater attcn- Vill
tion, and ought to have been better underltood.
The Dutch gave up the whole trade with their
colonies, both in the East and Weft- Indies, to
exclifive companies. The English, the French, the
Danes, have imitated their example with refpecQ
to the Eat-Indian commerce; and the two former
have laid a imilar restraint upon some branches
of their trade with the New World. The wit of
nan cannot, perhaps, devise a method for check-
ng the progress of industry and population in a
new colony more effectual than this. The interest
fthe colony, and of the exclusive company, must
in every point be diametrically opposite; and as
he latter possesses such advantages in this unequal
onteft, that it can prescribe at pleasure the terms
fintercourfe, the former muf; not only buy dear
nd fell cheap, but must fffer the mortification of
avinlg the increase of its surplus stock discouraged
vthofe very persons to whom alone it can dispose
fits productions '.
Spain , it is probable, was preserved from fall- Thtscon
nginto this error in policy, by the high ideas finedtoone
hich fle early formed concerning the riches of Spati
le New World. Gold and silver were commo.
ities of too high value to vcft a monopoly of
hem in private hands. The crown wished to retain
he diredtion of a commerce so inviting; and, in
rdcr to secure that, ordained the cargo of every

fcqucnce of this regulation, all the trade of Spai
.with the New World centred originally in the por
of Seville, and was gradually brought into a for
in which it has been conducEed, with little variation
from the middle of the sixteenth century almost t
our own times. For the greater security of th
valuable cargoes sent to America, as well as forth
more easy prevention of fiaud, the commerce
Spain, with its colonies, is carried on by fleets whic
fail under strong convoys. These fleets confiftin
of two squadrons, one difinguified by the nam
of the Ga'eons, the other by that of the Flota, a
equipped annually. Formerly they took their d
parture from Seville; but as the port of Cadiz h

from it since the year 1720.

Bfadeffeas The trade of Spain with her colonies, whil
rangement. thus fettered and reltrided, came necessarily to b

conducted with the fame spirit, and upon the far
principle, as that of an exclusive company. B
ing confined to a single port, it was of cour
thrown into a few hands, and almoff the whole
it was gradually engrossed by a small number
wealthy houses, formerly in Seville, and now
Cadiz. These by combinations, which they c
:afily form, may altogether prevent that comp
tition which preserves commodities at their natur
price; and by adting in concert, to which they a
prompted by their mutual interest, they may ra
or lower the value of them at pleasure. In con
quence of this, the price of European goods
America is always high, and often exorbitant.
hundred, two hundred, and even three hundr
per cent. are profits not uncommon in the co
rnerce of Spain with her colonies". From t
fame engrolfing spirit it frequently happens,
traders of the second order, whose warehouses
not contain a complete assortment of commodit
for the American market, cannot purchase fr
the more opulent merchants such goods as t|
want, at a lower price than that for which t
are fold in the colonies. With the fame vigil
jealousy that an exclusive company guards ngal

the intrusion of the free trader, those overgrown i o o
monopolists endeavour to check the progress of VII.
every one whose encroachments they dread ". This
refraint of the American commerce to one port,
not only affecs its domeflic Rate, but limits its
oreign operations. A monopolist may acquire
ore, and certainly will hazard less, by a confined
rade which yields exorbitant profit, than by an
:xenfive commerce in which he receives only a
oderate return of gain. It is often his interest
otto enlarge, but to circumscribe the sphere of
is activity; and, instead of calling forth more
igorous exertions of commercial industry, it may
ethe object of his attention to check and set
0onds to them. By some such maxim, the mer-
ntile policy of Spain seems to have regulated its
tercourfe with America. Instead of furnishing
e colonies with European goods in such quantity
might render both the price and the profit mo-
rate; the merchants of Seville and Cadiz seem
have supplied them with a sparing hand, that
e agernefs of competition amongst customers
bliged to purchase in a scanty market, might en-
le the Spanilh fators to dispose of their cargoes
ith exorbitant gain. About the middle of the last
ntury, when the exclurfve trade to America from
'ille was in its molt flourishing state, the burden

rious powers who favored the pretensions eith
of the Austrian or Bourbon candidate for the Sp
nifh throne, sent formidable fleets and armies
their support; France, England, and Holland re
ritted immense fums to Spain. These we
spent in the provinces which became the theat
of war. Part of the American treasure, of whit
foreigners had drained the kingdom, flowed bac
thither. From this era, one of the most inteli
gent Spanish authors dates the revival of the mn

the only means of receiving from thence any part

ligor of its maxims as to open the trade with
Peru to her allies the French. The merchants of
St. Malo, to whom Louis XIV. granted the pri.
vilege of this lucrative commerce, engaged in 'it
with vigor, and carried it on upon principles very
different from those of the Spaniards. They sup-
plied Peru with European commodities at a mode-
rate price, and not in stinted quantity. The goods
which they imported were conveyed to every pro-
vince of Spanish America, in such abundance as
had never been known in any former period. If
this intercourse had been continued, the exportation
of European commodities from Spain muff have 't3a

mother-country have been at an end. The most
peremptory injunctions were therefore issued, pro-

of knowing what commodities might be importe

quence of information so authentic and expedi

lifh colonies who traded to the Spanifb main, wer
enabled to assort and proportion their cargoes
exatly to the demands of the market, that th
contraband commerce was carried on with a faci
lity, and to an extent unknown in any former pc
riod. '1 his, however, was not the most fatal cons

tlence of the Affiento to the trade of Spain. The n o
Ietls of the 'Britif South-Sea company, under vm.
over of the.importation which they were autho-
zed to make by the fiip sent annually to Porto-
clo, poured in their commodities on the Spanish
ntinent, without limitation or rcftraint. Instead
a flip of five hundred tons, as itipulated in the
eaty, they usually employed one which exceeded
ine hundred tons in burden. She was accom-
anied by two or three smaller effels, which;
ooring in some neighbouring creek, supplied her
andeflinely with fresh bales of goods, to replace
,:h as were fold. The infpedtors of the fair, and
iicers of the revenue, gained by exorbitant pre-
nts, connived at the fraud '". Thus, partly by
e operations of the company, and partly by the
ivity of private interlopers, almost the whole
ade of Spanish America was engrossed by ' so
igners. The immense commerce of the G-

most frequently resorted. As private interest co
curred with the duty which they owed to the pu
lic, in rendering the officers who commanded th
vessels vigilant and ative, some check was give
to the progress of the contraband trade, though i
dominions so extensive, and so accessible by sea, n
number of cruisers was sufficient to guard again
its inroads in every quarter. This interruption
an intercourse, which had been carried on with
much facility, that the merchants in the Brit
colonies were accustomed to confider it almost
an allowed branch of commerce, excited murmu
and complaints. These authorized, in fomemeafu
and rendered more interesting, by several unju
fiable ads of violence committed by the captai
of the Spanilh Guarda Costas, precipitated Gre
Britain into a war with Spain; in consequence
-which the latter obtained a final release from

commerce of her colonies, without being refrain
by any engagement with a foreign power.

vantage of accommodating their importations

they perceived the necessity of dcvifing some
thod of fpplying their colonies, different fr
their ancient one, of fending thither periodi

feets. That mode of communication had been n o o t
found not only to be uncertain, as the departure vin.
of the Galeons and Flota was sometimes re-
tarded by various accidents, and often prevented
by the wars vwhich raged in Europe; but long
experience had hown it to be ill adapted to afford
America a regular and timely supply of what it
vanted. The scarcity of European goods in the
panimf settlements frequently became excefive;
heir price rose to an enormous height; the vigi-
nt eye of mercantile attention did not fail to ob-
rve this favorable opportunity, an ample supply
as poured in by interlopers from the English, the
rench, and Dutch islands; and when the Galeons
tlength arrived, they found the marketsfo glut.
id by this illicit commerce, that there was no
emand for the commodities with which they were
oaded. In order to remedy this, Spain has per-
itted a considerable part of her commerce with
merica, to be carried on by regflerr ships. These
refitted out, during the intervals between the stated
afons when the Galeons and Flota fail, by mer.
hants in Seville or Cadiz, upon obtaining a licence
om the council of the Indies, for which they pay
very high premium, and are deffined for those
orts in America where any extraordinary demand
foreseen or expected. By this expedient, fich
regular supply of the commodities, for which there
the greatefl demand, is conveyed to the American
arket, that the interloper is no longer allured by
he fame profped of excessive gain, or the people
the colonies urged by the fame necessity to engage
I the hazardous adventures of contraband trade.

n 0o K In proportion as experience manifefled the ad

viii. vantages of carrying on trade in this mode, the

Tlhe Galeons number of register Lhips increased, and at lengt
bolished. in the year 1748, the Galeons, after having beer

employed upwards of two centuries, were finally
laid aside. From that period there has been noin
tercourfe with Chili and Peru but by single hips,
dispatched from time to time as occasion requires,
and when the merchants expect a profitable market
will open. These sips fail round Cape Horn, and
convey diredly to the ports in the South-Sea the pro.
duftions and manufactures of Europe, for which the
people, fettled in those countries, were formerly
obliged to repair to Porto-b1llo or Panama. These
towns, as has been formerly observed, must gradually
decline, when deprived of that commerce to which
they owed their prosperity. This disadvantage how
ever is more than compensated ; for the whole conti
nent ofSouth-America receives supplies of European
commodities, with so much regularity, and in fuc
abundance, as must not only contribute greatly tothe
happiness, but increase the population of all theco
lonies fettled there. But as all the register ships del
tined for the SouthSeas, muff still take their de
parture from Cadiz, and are obliged to retun
thither ', this branch of the American commerce
even in its new and improved form, continues subjei
to the reitraints of a species of monopoly, and feel
those pernicious effects of it, which I have alread
described.

the people of Europe have acquired, in confe-

tries which they conquered in America, that for
chocolate is one of the most universal. The us of
this liquor made with a panfe, formed of the nut,

eral parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the

ieince of this acknowledged superiority in the
uality of tacao in that province, and its commu-
ication with the Atlantic, which facilitates the
on:0cyance to Europe, the culture of the cacao
here is more extensive than in any dlifrid of Ame-

merchants, an excluive right to the commerc
with Caraccas and Cumana, on condition of the
employing, at their own expense, a fufficien
number of armed veftels to clear the coast of in
terlopers. This society, distinguished sometime
by the name of the Company of Guipufcoa, fro
the province of Spain in which it is eftablifled
and sometimes by that of the Company of Cara
cas, from the diftrid of America to which it trades
has carried on its operations with such vigor an
success, that Spain has recovered an importan
branch of commerce, which she had suffered
be wrefled from her, and is plentifully fupplie
with an article of extensive consumption at a m
derate price. Not only the parent state, but t
colony of Caraccas, has derived great advantag
from this intfitution; for although, at the fir
asped, it may appear to be one of those monop
lies, whose tendency is to check the spirit of i

events in her own colonies. But though this de-
sec i police was sensibly felt, and the remedy for
it w.i obvious, that jealous spirit with which the
Spanilh monarchs guarded the exclusive trade, re-
rtrained them from applying it. At length
Charles 11. frmounted those considerations which
had deterred his predecessors, and in the year 1764
appointed packet-boats to be dispatched on the
lrft day of each month , from Corugna to the
Havanna or Porto-Kico. From thence letters are
conveyed in fmallcr vessels to Vcra Cruz and
Porto-bello, and tanfnitted by poll through the
kingdoms of Tierra Firme, Granada , Peru, and
New Spain. With no less regularity packet- boats
il once in two months to Rio de la Plata, for the
ccommodation of the provinces to the east of the
ndes. T'hus provision is made for a speedy and
ertain circulation of intelligence throughout the
aft dominions of Spain, from which equal advan.
Iges mut redound to the political and mercantile

cntreft of the kingdom `o7. With this new arrange-
ent, a scheme of extending commerce has been
ore immediately conneted. Each of the packet-
oats, which are vessels of some considerable bur-
en, is allowed to take in half a loading of such
ommodities as are the product of Spain , and moRt

of those rigid laws, which confined the trade with
the New World to a single port, and the fir-t attempt
to admit the reft of the kingdom to some tiare

pernittld to the year 7 65 , Charles III. laid open the tradelo
several pro-
vinces. the windward islands, Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto.

Rico, Mlargarita, and Trinidad, to his fubjedsin
every province of Spain. He permitted them to
lil from certain ports in each province, which are
specified in the edicd, at any season, and with what.
ever cargo they deemed most proper, without any
other warrant than a simple clearance from the
custom-house of the place whence they took their
departure. He released them from the numerou
and oppreflive duties imposed on goods exportel
to America, and in place of the whole, fubftitutec
a moderate tax of fix in the hundred on the cor
modities sent from Spain. He allowed them t
return either to the fame port, or to any othe
.where they might hope for a more advantageou
market, and there to enter the homeward cargo
on payment of the usual duties. This ample pri
vilege, whlich at once broke through all the fence
which the jealous policy of Spain had been laboring

vinces of Yucatan and Campeachy '. v1T;

The propriety of this innovation, which may Bcic:i i

be confidered as the most liberal effort of Spanifil eC;sotit:
legifltion , has appeared from its effdts. Prior to
the edic: in f.vor of the free trade , Spain derived
hardly any benefit from its negledted colonies in
Hispaniola , Porto-Rico , Margarita, and Trinidad.
lt commerce with Cuba was inconsiderable, and
thit of Yucatan and Campeachy was engrossed al-
most entirely by interlopers. But as soon as a ge-
ner1l liberty of trade was permitted, the inter-
coiirfe with those provinces revived, and has gone
onwith a rapidity of progression , of which there
are few examples in the hifiory of nations. In less
thiin ten years, the trade of Cuba has been more
than tripled. Even in those fetrlements where,
om the languilhing state of industry , greater
fforts were requisite to restore its activity their
ommerce has been doubled. It is computed,
i;a fch a number of ships is already employed in
he free trade, that the tonnage of them far exceeds
bat of the Galeons and Flota , at the molt flourifli-
ng xcra of their commerce. The benefits of this
rrangement are not confined to a few merchants,

soon able to supply itfeif with several commodities
of extensive consumption, for which it formerly

other nations. This commodity, which has no

the Spaniards were obliged to purchase of foreig

the jealous maxims of the old system , all the pro-
vinces situated on the South-Seas were prohibited,
under the most severe penalties, from holding any
communication with one another. Though each
of these yield peculiar productions, the reciprocal
xchange of which might have added to the happi-

ted their progress in indufiry, so solicitous was

orrefpondence with their fellow-fubjeds, as tended
anifeftly to their mutual prosperity. Of all the nu-
erous reftridions devised by Spain for securing the
xclufve trade with her American settlements, none
erhaps was more illiberal, none seems to have been
ore fenribly felt, or to have produced more hurt-
effects. This grievance, coeval with the fettle-
ents of Spain in the countries situated on the Pacific
cean, is at last rcdrefed. In the year 1774,

which had been long felt, and long complained of,
are, in a great measure, removed. The countries

feat of government at Buenos-Ayres, will be com.
modious and accessible. The contraband trade with
the Portuguese, which was become so extensive,
as muff have put a final stop to the exportation of
commodities from Spain to her southern colonies,
may be checked more thoroughly, and with greater
facility, when the supreme magistrate, by his vi-
cinity to the places in which it is carried on, can
view its progress and effects with his own eyes.
Don Pedro Zevallos, who has been raised to this
new dignity, with appointments equal to those of
the other viceroys, is well acquainted both with
the state and the interest of the countries over
which he is to preside, having served in them long,
and with diftindion. By this dismemberment,

The limits of the viceroyalty of New Spain have Newgovern-

parate government. The Chevalier de Croix, who
intrusted with this command, is not dignified with
e title of viceroy, nor does he enjoy the appoint-
ents belonging to that rank, but his jurifdidion
altogether independent on the viceroyalty of New

Nor has their attention been so entirely engross
by what related to the more remote parts of the
dominions, as to render them negletful of what v
fill more important, the reformation of domed
errors and defects in policy. Fully sensible of
causes to which the declension of Spain, from h
former prosperity, ought to be imputed; they h
made it a great object of their policy, to reviv
spirit of industry among their fubjets, and to gi
such extent and perfection to their manufadur
that they may be able to supply the demands
America from their own stock, and to exclude
reigners from a branch of commerce which has b
so fatal to the kingdom. This they have end
voured to accomplish, by a variety of edicts if
since the peace of Utrecht. They have gran
bounties for the encouragement of some branc
of industry; they have lowered the taxes on othe
they have either entirely prohibited, or have loa
with additional duties, such foreign manusad
as come in competition with their own ; they i
inflituted societics for the improvement of tr

and agriculture; they have planted colonies of hus- R o o
bandmen in some uncultivated dillrids of Spain, viII.
and divided among them the waste fields; they
have had recourse to every expedientc, devised by
colnmercial wisdom, or commercial jealousy, for
reviving their own industry, and difcountenancing
that of other nations. These, however, it is not
my province to explain, or to inquire into their pro-
priety and effects. There is no effort of legislation
more arduous , no experiment in policy more un-
certain, than an attempt to revive the fpjrit of
indulfry where it has declined, or to introduce it
where it is unknown. Nations , already possessed
of extcnfive commerce, enter into competition with
ftuch advantages, derived from the large capitals
and extensive credit of their merchants, the dexte-
rity of their manufacurers, the alertness acquired
by habit in every department of business, that the
hate which aims at rivalling, or supplanting them,
must expedt to struggle with many difficulties, and
be content to advance slowly. If the quantity of
productive indufftry, now in Spain, be compared
with that of the kingdom under the lafl listless
monarchs of the Austrian line, its progress muff
appear considerable and is fufficent to alarm the
ieloufy, and to call forth the mofl vigorous es-
orts, of the nations now in possession of the lucra-
tive trade which the Spaniards aim at wrefling from
hemi. One circumfiance may render those exer-
oils of Spain an object of more serious attention
te other European powers. They are not to be
fribed wholly to the influence of the crown and

B o o i its mininters. The sentiments and spirit of the

vill. people seem to second the provident care of their

monarchs, and to give it greater effect. The na.
tion has adopted more liberal ideas, not only with
refped to commerce, but domestic policy. In all
the later Spanish writers, defects in the arrange.
mnents of their country concerning both are ac.
knowledged, and remedies proposed, which igno.
rance rendered their ancestors incapable of discern.
ing, and pride would not have allowed them to
confess "+. But after all that the Spaniards have
done, much remains to do. Many pernicious inlti
tutions and abuses, deeply incorporated with the
system of internal policy and taxation , which has
been long established in Spain, mutf be abolished,
before industry and manufactures can recover an
extensive activity.

Contraband Still, however, the commercial regulations o
trade. Spain with refpef to her colonies, are too rigi

and systematical to be carried into complete exe
cution. The legislature that loads trade with im
positions too heavy, or fetters it by reftridions to
severe, defeats its own intention; and is only mul
tiplying the inducements to violate its statutes
and proposing a high premium to encourag
illicit traffic. The Spaniards, both in Europ
and America, being circumscribed in their mutua
intercourse by the jealousy of the crown , o
oppressed by its exadions, have their inventiol

This spirit , counteracting that of the laws, per-
vades the commerce of Spain with America in all
itsbranches; and from the highest departments in
government, descends to the lowest. The very of-
icers appointed to check contraband trade, are
often employed as instruments in carrying it on;
and the boards instituted to restrain and pnilh it,
are the channels through which it flows. The
king is supposed, by the molt intelligent Spanish
writers, to be defrauded by various artifices, of
more than one half of the revenue which he ought

nply with all the valuable productions and manu. Vll.
aures of the East, as enabled it to open a trade
ith America, bya course of navigation, the longest
on hind to land on our globe. In the infancy
f this trade, it was carried on with Callao, on
he coast of Peru ; but experience having disco-
ered the impropriety of fixing upon that as the
ort of communication with Manila, the staple
fthe commerce between the east and weft was
moving from Callao to Acapulco, on the coast
New Spain.
After various arrangements, it has been brought
to a regular form. One or two hips depart an.
tally from Acapulco, which are permitted to carry
it silver to the amount of five hundred thousand
cos'", but they have hardly any thing else of value
board; in return for which, they bring back
ces, drugs, china, and japan wares, calicoes,
iintz, muslins, silks, and every precious article,
ith which the benignity of the climate, or the
genuity of its people, has enabled the East to sup.
y the reft of the world. For some time the mer-
hints of Peru were admitted to participate in this
afic, and might sent annually a flip to Acapulco,
wait the arrival of the vessels from Manila, and
ceive a proportional hare of the commodities
hich they imported. At length, the Peruvians

In consequence of this indulgence, the inhabi

ants of that country enjoy advantages unknow
in the other Spaniff colonies. The manufature
of the East are not only more suited to a wart
climate, and more filowy than those of Europq
but can be fold at a lower price; while, at the fam
time, the profits upon them are so considerable,
to enrich all those who are employed, either
bringing them from Manila, or vending them
New Spain. As the interest both of the buyer a
feller concurred in favoring this branch of co
merce, it has continued to extend in spite of reg
lations, concerted with the mot anxious jealousy

permit to be imported, great quantities of Ind
goods are poured into the markets of New Spain'
and when the flota arrives at Vera Cruz fro
Europe , it often finds the wants of the peo
already supplied by cheaper and more accepta
commodities.

it is almost impossible to determine with precision.
The extent of the Spanifl dominions in America,
the jealousy of government, which renders them
inaccessible to foreigners, the mysterious silence
which the Spaniards are accuflomed to observe
with refpec to the interior slate of their colonies,
combine in covering this subjed with a veil
which it is not easy to remove. But an account,
apparently no less accurate than it is curious,
has lately been publilled of the royal revenue
in New Spain , from which we may form fomen
idea with refped to what is collected in the other
provinces. According to that account, the crown
does not receive from all the departments of
taxation in New Spain above a million of our
money, from which one half mufl be deduced
as the expense of the provincial etablinlmeit ".
Peru, it is probable , yields a fum not inferior to
this; and if we fppofe that all the other regions
of America, illcluding the islands, furnifl a third
0lire of equal value, we liall not perhaps be far
wide from the truth , if we conclude, that the net
public revenue of Spain , railcd in America , does
not exceed a millionI and a half flerling. This

t b o ic falls far short of the immense fums to which sup.

vYii, positions, founded upon conjedure, have raised

the Spaninl revenue in America ". It is remark.
able, however, upon one account. Spain and Por.
tugal are the only European powers, who derive
a dired revenue from their colonies. All the ad.
vantage that accrues to other nations, from their
American dominions, arises from the exclusive
enjoyment of their trade; but beside this, Spain
has brought her colonies to contribute towards
increasing the power of the slate; and in return
for protection, to bear a proportional fliare of the
common burden.

Accordingly, the fum which I have computed

to be the amount of the Spanisfi revenue from
America, arises wholly from the taxes collcded
there, and is far from being the whole of what ac.
crues to the king from his dominions in the New
World. The heavy duties imposed on the com-
modities exported from Spain to America ', as well
as what is paid by those which he fends home in
return; the tax upon the negroe-flaves, with which
Africa supplies the New World, together with fe-
veral smaller branches of finance, bring large fums
into the treasury, the precise extent of which I can-

NOTE I. p. .

IN tracing the progress of the Spanilh arms in New
Spain, we have followed Cortes himself as our most
certain guide. His dispatches to the emperor contain a
minute account of his operations. But the unlettered
conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his ownr
exploits. Our information with refped to them, and other
tranfadions in Peru, is derived however from contemporary
and refpedable authors.

The molt early account of Pizarro's tranfadions in
Peru, was published by Francisco de Xerez, his secretary.
It is a simple unadorned narrative, carried down no far-
ther than the death of Atahualpa, in i5; : for the author
returned to Spain in 4, and oon after he landed,
printed at Seville his hort History of the Conquest of
Peru, addressed to the emperor.

Don Pedro Sancho, an officer who served under Pizarro,
drew up an account of his expedition, which was translated
into Italian by Ramuio, and inserted in his valuable
colledtion, but has never been published in its original
language. Sancho returned to Spain at the fame time
With Xerez. Great credit is due to what both there authors
relate concerning the progress and operations of Pizarro;
but the residence of the Spaniards in Peru had been so short,
h the time when they left it, 4nd their intercourse with

the natives so slender, that their knowledge of the Peruvian
manners and cuflons is very imperfet.

The next contemporary historian is Pedro Cieza de

Leon, who published his Chronica del Peru, at Seville, in
I i 3. If he had finished all that he proposes in the
general division of his work, it would have been the mofi
complete history which had been published of any region
in the New \X'orld. He was well qualified to execute it,
having served during seventeen years in America, and
having visited in person molt of the provinces concerning
which he had occasion to write. But only the first part
of his Chronicle has been printed. It contains a description
of Peru, and several of the adjacent provinces, with an
account of the institutions and customs of the natives, and
is written with so little art, and such an apparent regard
for truth, that one must regret the loss of the other parts
of his work.

This los is amply supplied by Don Augustine Zarate,

who publifled, in ix S , his Hiftoria del Defcubrimiento
y Conquifta de la Provincia del Peru. Zarate was a man
of rank and education, and employed in Peru as comp-
troller-general of the public revenue. His history, whether
we attend to its matter or composition, is a book o
considerable merit; as he had opportunity to be well in.
formed, and seems to have been inquisitive with refpe to
the manners and tranfations of the Peruvians, great credit
is due to his testimony.

Don Diego Fernandez publifled his Hiftoria del Peru,

in 71. His sole object is to relate the difenfions and
civil wars of the Spaniards in that empire. As he served
in a public fiation in Peru, and was well acquainted bot
with the country, and with the principal actors in thof
singular scenes which he dccribes, as he possessed foun
undcrltanding, and great impartiality, his work may b
rankled amnong those of the historians most diftinguiflied so
their induflry in research , or their capacity in judging wit
refped to the events which they relate.

The lalt author who can be reckoned among the con

temporary historians of the conquest of Peru, is Garcilaffo
de la Vega, Inca. For though the first part of his work,
entitled, Commnen;tarios Reales del Origenz de los Incas
feyes del Peru, was not published sooner than the year
1609, feventy-fix years after the death of Atahualpa the
last emperor, yet as he was born in Peru , and was the
son of an officer ofdiftintion among the Spanilh conquerors,
b a Coya, or lady of the royal race, on account of
which he always took the name of Inca as he was matter
of the language spoken by the Incas, and acquainted with
the traditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very
high, and often placed above that of all the other historians.
His work, however, is little more than a commentary
upon the Spanish writers of the Peruvain story, and
composed of quotations taken from the authors whom I have
mentioned. This is the idea which he himself gives of it,
Lib. i. c. . Nor is it in the account of facts only that
he follows them servilely. Even in explaining the institutions
and rites of his ancestors, his information seems not to
be more perfec than theirs. His explanation of the Quipos
is almost the fame with that of Acofta He produces no
specimen of Peruvian poetry, but that wretched one which
he borrows from Bias Valera, an early missionary, whose
memoirs have never been published. Lib. ii. c. . As
for composition, arrangement, br a capacity of diftinguilhing
bets'een what is fabulous , what is probable, and what is
true, one searches for them in vain in the commentaries
of the Inca. His work , however, notwithstanding its
great defeds, is not altogether destitute of use. Some
traditions which he received from his countrymen are
preserved in it. His knowledge of the Peruvian language
has enabled him to corredt ome errors of the Spanish
writets, and he has inserted in it ome curious facts, taken
f"iiis authors whose works were never published, and are
now loft.

HIS extravagant and unseasonable discourse of Valverde
been censured by all historians, and with justice. But
ugh he seems to have been an illiterate and bigotted
nlk, notnife resembling the good Olmedo, who accom-
nied Cortes; the absurdity of his address to Atahualpa must
ut be charged wholly upon him. His harangue is
idently a translation, or paraphrase of that form,
ncerted by a junto of Spanish divines and lawyers in the
ar 109, for explaining the right of their king to the
reignty of the New World, and for directing the
cers employed in America how they should take posses-
in of any new country. See Vol. i. Note xxiii. The
atiments contained in Valverde's harangue nuft not then
imputed to the bigotted imbecility of a particular man,
t to that of the age. But Gomara and Benzoni relate
circunftance concerning Valverde, which, if authen-
renders him an object, not of contempt only, but
horror. They atert, that during the whole aion,
dverde continued to excite the soldiers to laughter,
tling to them to strike the enemy, not with the edge,
twith the points of their swords. Gom. Chron. c. X i;.

vecry different from that of the Roman Catholic clergy

in other parts of America, where they uniformly exerte
their influence to protect the Indians, and to modera
the ferocity of their countrymen.

NOTE VII. p. 35.

T WO different fyftcms have been formed concernin
the condua of Atahualpa. The Spanish writers, in orde
to justify the violence of their countrymen, contend, tha
all the Inca's profellions of fiiendfhip were feigned; an
that his intention in agreeing to an interview with Pizarn
at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers at on
blow ; that for this purpose he advanced with such
numerous body of attendants, who had arms concealec
under their garments to execute this scheme. This is th
account given by Xerez and Zarate, and adopted b]
Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca to dero
the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he woul
have permitted them to march unmolested through th
desert of Motupe, or have neglected to defend the pass
in the mountains, where they might have been attacke
with so much advantage. If the Peruvians marched t
Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards
it is incunceivable, that of so great a body of men
prepared for ation, not one flould attempt to mak
resistance, but all tamely susser themselves to be butchere
hy an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Atahualia
node of advancing to the interview , has the aspect of ape
ceable procellion, not of a military enterprise. He himfclfan
his followers we.re, in their habits of ceremony, preceded,
on days of solemnity , by unarmed harbingers. Though u
nations are frequently cunning ad falle , yet, if a fchen
of deception and treachery mull be inputed either to
monarch, that had no grect reason to be alarmed at a vil
from firangers who solicited admiflion into his prceence
friends, or to an adventurer so daring, and so litt
fcrupulouus s P izarro, one cannot helitate in detclinill

where to fix the prefuiption of guilt. Even amidst the
endeavours of the Spanish writers to palliate the proceedings
of Pizarro, one plainly perceives, that it was his intention,
as well as his interest, to seize the Inca, and that he
had taken measures for that purpose previous to any suspicion
of that monarch's designs.

Garcilaffo de la Vega, extremely solicitous to vindicate

his countrymen, the Peruvians, from the crime of having
concerted the destruCtion of Pizarro and his followers, and
no less afraid to charge the Spaniards with improper
conduct towards the Inca, has framed another system. He
relaces, that a man of majestic form, with a long heard,
and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in
rilion to Viracocha, the eighth Inca , and declared, that he
was a child of the Sun, that monarch built a temple in
honor of this person, and ereced an image of him,
resembling as nearly as poflible the singular form in which
he had exhibited himself to his view. In this temple, divine
honors were paid to him, by the name of Viracocha. P. i.
lib. iv. c. 21. lib. v. c. 2. 'When the Spaniards firit
appeared in Peru, the length of their beards, and the
dress they wore, struck every perfun so much with their
likeness to the image of Viracocha, that they supposed then
to be children of the Sun, who had descended from heaven
to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the
Peruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne
would be occupied by new pofeffors. Atahualpa himself,
confidering the Spaniards as messengers from heaven, was
so far from entertaining any thoughts of reiflting them,
that he determined to yield implicit obedience to their
comnmnds. From those sentiments flowed his profefions
of love and refpedt. To those were owing the cordial
reception of Soto and Ferdinand Pizarro in his camp, and
the fubmiflive reverence with which he himself advanced
to vilit the Spanish general in his quarters; but from the
gr(s ignorance of Philipillo, the interpreter , the declaration
ol the Spaniards, and his answer to it. were so ill explained,
that by their mutual inability to comprchend ca;i other's

intentions, the fatal rencounter at Caxamalca, with all its
dreadful consequences, was occasioned.

It is remarkable, that no traces of this superstitious

veneration of the Peruvians for the Spaniards, are to be
found either in Xerez, or Sancho or Zarate, previous
to the interview at Caxanialta; and yet the two former
served under Pizarro at that time, and the latter visited
Peru soon fter the conquest. If either the Inca himself,
or his mefrengers, had addressed the Spaniards in the
words which Garcilaffo puts in their mouths, they mut
have been struck with such submissive declarations and
they would certainly have availed themselves of them to
accomplifl their own deligns with greater facility. Gar.
cilaffo himself, though his narrative of the intercourse
between the Inca and Spaniards, preceding the rencounter
at Caxamalca , is founded on the fuppolition of his
believing them to be Viracochas, or divine beings, P. ii.
lib. i. c. 17 , &c. yet with his usual inattention and
inaccuracy he admits, in another place, that the Peruvians
did not recollect the resemblance between them and the
god Viracocha, until the fatal difaficers fubfcqucnt to the
defeat at Caxamaica , and then only began to call them
Viracochas P. i. lib. v. c 2r. This is confirmed by
Herrera, dec. . lib. ii. c. 12. In many different parts
of America, if we may believe the Spanihl writers, their
countrymen were considered as divine beings who had|
descended from Heaven. But in this infiince , as in many
wh;ch occur in the intercourle between nations whore
progress in refinement is very unequal, the ideas of those
who used the exprellion were different friom the ideas of
those who heard it. For such is the idiom of the Indian
languages, or such is the implicity of thole who speak
them, that when they fee any thing with which they were
formerly unacquainted, and of which they do not know
the origin; they ay, that it came down from Heaven.

N OTHING can be a more striking proof of this, than
that three Spaniards travelled froin Caxamalca to Cuzco.
Ihe dilbince betveen them is fix hundred miles. In every

treated with all the honors which the Peruvians paid to
their fovercigns, and even to their divinities. Under

te Inca, they denlanded the pl:ttes of gold with which

crcd ornaments , and the pople refured to violate the
;rire of their God , the three Spaniards, with their own
.nds, robbed the Temple us parc of this valuable treafurc;

T HE Peruvians not only imitated the military arts of the
Spaniards, but had recourse to devices of their own. As
the cavalry were the chief object of their terror, they
endeavoured to render them incapable of ating, by means
of a long thong with a stone falened to each end. This,
ihcn thrown by a kilful hand, twitted about the horse
and its rider, and entangled them so as to obftrut their
motions. Herrera mentions this as an invention of their
Lwn. Dec. . lib. viii. c. 4. But as I. have observed,
rol. ii .

p . '6, this weapon is common among several

barbarous tribes towards the extremity of South-America;
and it is more probable, that the Peruvians had observed
the dexterity with which they used it in hunting, and on
this occasion adopted it themselves. The Spaniards ere
cnliderably annoyed by it. Herrera, ibid. Another instance
of the ingenuity of the Peruvians deserves mention. By
turning a river out of its channel, they overflowed a valley,

that it was with the utmost difficulty the Spaniards made

from the want of a decent drcfs, were obliged to keep

much afraid of giving offence to Pizarro, that they durit
not entertain or even converfr with them. One may
conceive what was the condition, and what the indignation
of men once accustomed to power and opulence, when

IN my inquiries concerning the manners and policy of
the Mexicans, I have received much information from
a large manuscript of Don Alonfo de Gorita, one of the
judges in the Court of Audience of Mexico. In the year
i 5 , Philip. I1. in order to discover the mode of levying
tribute from his Indian subjeCts, that would be most
beneficial to the crown, and least oppressive to them,
addressed a mandate to all the Courts of Audience in
America, enjoining them to answer certain queries which
he proposed to them, concerning the ancient form of
government established among the various nations of Indians,
and the mode in which they had been accustomed to pay
taxes to their kings or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate,
Corita, who had relided nineteen years in America, four-
teen of which he pafled in New Spain, conlpolcd the
work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his sovereign,
that he had made it an objecL during his refidcnce in
America, and in all its provinces which he had vilited, to
inquire diligently into the manners and cutloms of the

initives, that he had conversed for this purpose with many
aged and intelligent Indians, and consulted several of the
Spanish ecclesiastics, who understood the Indian languages
moll perfectly, particularly some of those who landed in
New Spain oon after the conquest. Corita appears to
be a man of some learning, and to have carried on his
inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to which he
pretends. Greater credit is due to his testimony from
one circumstance. His work was not composed with a
view to publication, or in support of any particular theory,
but contains simple, though full answers to queries pro-
poled to him officially. Though Herrera does not mention
him among the authors whom he had followed as guides
in his hifrory, I fiould suppose, from several sacs of which he
takes notice, as well as from several expreflions which he uses,
that this memorial of Corita was not unknown to him.

NOTE XXI. p. ig.

THE early Spanifl writers were so haRy and inaccurate
in etimating the numbers of people in the provinces and
towns of America , that it is impoflible to ascertain that of
\lexico itself with any degree of precision. Cortes describes
the extent and populousness of Mexico in general terms,
ihich imply that it was not inferior to the greatest cities

IT is to P. Torribio de Benavente , that I am indebted
for this curious observation. Palafox, bishop of Ciudad
de a Puebla Los Angeles, confirms and illustrates it more
fully. The Mexican (fays he) is the only language in
which a termination indicating refpedt, fylabas reverenciales
, de corte/Ia, may be affixed to every word. By adding
the final tlllable 2in or aain to any word, it becomes a
proper expreflfion of veneration in the mouth of an inferior.
If, in speaking to an equal, the word Father is to be
used, it is Ttil, but an inferior fays Tatzin. One priest
speaking to another, calls him Teopi.xqze; a person of
inferior rank calls him Teolixcatzin. The name of the
emperor who reigned when Cortes invaded Mexico, was
Aion:te2ztima, but his vassals, from reverence, pronounced
it Ionztezulmaii. Torribio, AIS. Palaf. Virtudes dl
Indio, p. 6. The Mexicans had not only reverential
nouns, but reverential verbs. The manner in which there
are formed from the verbs in common use, is explained

e ROM comparing several pailTgcs in Corita and llerrera,

one may collet with tbme degree of accuracy, the various
modes in which the Mlexicans contributed towards the
flpport of government. Some persons of the first order
eemn to have been cxcmpted from the payment of n"Y
tribute, and as their only duty to the public, were bound
to personal firvice in war, and to follow the banner of

c sovereign with their vafTals. 2. The immediate vafTals
tle crown were bound only to personal military fcrvice,
:t paid a certain proportion of the produce of their lands
n kin. i. Those who held offices of honor or trull,
,d a certain hnare of what they received in consequence
I holiin these. 4. Each CaIzdlle , or afuciation,
uki;vtcd ome part of the commo field allotted to it,
r the behoof of the crown, and deposited the produce
the royal granaries. S. Some part of whatever was
rouht to the public markets, whether fruits of the earth,
tr e various productions of their artists and manufacurers,
as demanded for the public use, and the merchants who
aid this were exempted from every other tax. 6. The
Iequer, or andJfiipti glebe, were bound to cultivate
ertin diftrids in every province, which may be confidered
i crow - lands, and brought the increase into public
rehouses. Thus the overeign received ome part of
hatever was useful or valuable in the country, whether
was the natural production of the foil, or acquired by
he industry of the people. What each contributed towards
e support of government, seems to have been inconfi-
erable. Corita, in answer to one of the queries put to
e Audience of Mexico by Philip II. endeavours to estimate
money the value of what each citizen might be supposed
pas, and does not reckon it at more than three or
ur reals, about eighteen pence or two flillings a head.

ORTES, who seems to have been as much afloniflcd
ith this , as with any inflance of Mexican ingenuity, gives
particular description of it. Along one of the causeways,

lnluits , comipoLfd of clay tempered with mortar , about
( aces in breadth , and rifed about fix feet. In one of
i1e' is conveyed a ftrcam of excellent water, as large as the

all the inhabitants plentifully. The other is empty, thpt whet
it is necefliry to clean, or repair the former , the slream o
water may be turned into it. As this conduit passes along tw
of the bridges , where there are breaches in the causeway
through which the fait - water of the lake flows , it is con
veyed over them in pipes as large as the body of an ox, the

As the Mexican paintings are the most curious monuments
tantof the earliest mode of writing, it will not be improper
give some account of the means by which they were pre-
ved from the general wreck of every work of art in America,
d communicated to the Public. For the most early
d complete collection of there published by Purchas, we
eindebted to the attention of that curious inquirer, Hakluyt.
on Antonio Mendoza , viceroy of New Spain , having
emed those paintings a proper present for Charles V. the
ip in which they were ent to Spain , was taken by a
ench cruizer, and they camhe into the po{feflion of Thevet,
king's geographer, who having travelled himfclf into the
ew World , and described one of its provinces , was a
rious observer of whatever tended to illustrate the manners
the Americans. On his death , they were purchased by
akluyt, at that time chaplain of the Englilh ambalrador to
Ierench court; and, being left by himn to Purchas,'were
blifed at the desire of the learned antiquary Sir Henry
chllan. Purchas. iii. io6 .
THE second fpecinlen of Mexican picture-writing, was
Ililhed by Dr. Francis Gemlli Carreri , in two copper-

it. The first is a m;p , or representation of the progref&
the anciJet Mexicans on their firlt arrival in the country,

and of the various flations in which they fettled, before the
founded the capital of their empire in the lake of Mexico
The second is a Chronological VWheel, or Cirele , reprefen
ing the manner in which they computed and marked thei
cÂ¢cle of fifty two years. The former was given to him b
Dr. Critioval de Guadalajora , in.the city of Puebla de
Angeles; the latter he received from Don Carlos de Siguenz
y Congorra. But as it seems now to be a received opinio
( founded I know not on what evidence ) that Carreri w
never out of Italy, and that his famous Giro del Monl
is an account of a fiditious voyage, I have not mentione
these paintings in the text. They have, however, manifefi
the appearance of being Mexican productions, and are allo
ed to be so by Boturini, who was well qualified to determin
whether they were genuine or supposititious. The style
painting in the former is considerably more perfect than an
other specimen of Mexican design ; but as the original
said to have been much defaced by time, I fufpeit that
has been improved by ome touches from the hand of
European artist. Carreri , Churchill, iv. p. 4.-. The chr
nological wheel is a just delineation of the Mexican mode
computing time , as described by Acofta, lib. vi. c. 2,
seems to resemble one which that learned Jesuit had seen
and if it be admitted as a genuine monument, it proves th
the lMexicans had artificial , or arbitrary characters, whi
represented several things belides numbers. Each month
there represented by a symbol expreflive of some work
rite peculiar to it.

Tllr: third specimen of Mexican painting was discover

by another Italian. In 736, Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci
out for New Spain , and was led by several incidents
flu ly the language of the lexicans , and to collec t
remains of their hiiforical monuments. He prfilled nine yea
in his researches , with the entlhulilfil of a projector, a
the patience of an antiquary. In 1746 , he published
Madrid , Idea de rlna Nevi HiJlorial General de la A'eri
Septentriolnal, containing an account of the result of his inq
rics; and he added to it a catalogue of his American lliltorln

ufeum, arranged under thirty-fix different heads. His idea
a New History appears to me the work of a whimsical
edulous nian. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings,
ibute-olls, calendars , &c. is much larger than one could
ve expected. Unfortunately a ship, in which he had ent
considerable part of them to Europe , was taken by an
nglilh privateer during the war between Great Britain and
ain which commenced in the year 1719 ; and it is pro-
able that they perished by flling into the hands of ignorant
aptors. Boturini himself incurred the displeasure of the
anifh court, and died in a hospital at Madrid. The history,
which the Idea , &c. was only a ,rooJec7ts , was never
blifhed. The remainder of his ufeum eems to have
eendifperfed. Some part of it came into the poifeflion of
e present archbishop of Toledo, when he was primate of
ewSpain, and he published from it that curious tribute-
I1 which I have mentioned.
The only other collection of Mexican paintings, as far as
can learn, is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order
ftheir Imperial Majesties, I have obtained such a specimen
:these as I desired, in eight paintings, made with so much
elity , that 1 am informed the copies could hardly be
iiinguifhed from the originals. According to a note in this
o.ex Mexicanis , it appears to have been a present from
nmanuel King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died
DD. i13. \fter pairing through the hands of several
ftrious proprietors , it fell into those of the cardinal of
xe -.ifenach , who presented it to the emperor Leopold.
iefe paintings are manifestly Mexican , but they are in a
le very different from any of the former. An engraving
i been made of one of them , in order to gratify such
fny readers, as may deem this an object worthy of their
tention. Were it an object of fulficient importance, it
igbt, perhips, be polible , by recourse to the plates of
archas, and the archbiflop of Toledo, as a key, to frnn
lufilhle conjectures concerning the meaning of this pidcure.
lany of the figures are evidently flinilar. A A. are targets

la tirts , alhllft i ths fiale form with thlof publiflhed by

Purchas, p. o0o, o7 , &c. B. B. are figures of temples
nearly resembling those in Purchas, p. o9 and 11 , a
in orenzana , Plate II. C. is a bale of mantles, or cotta
clothes, the figure of which occurs in almost every plate
Purchas and Lorenzana. E. E. E. seem to be Mexican captai
in their war dres , the fantaflic ornaments of which refe
ble the figures in Furchas, p. I I o, 1 1 I , 1t. I houl
suppose this piture to be a tribute- roll , as their mode
noting numbers occurs frequently. D. D. D &c. Accordin
to Boturini , the mode of computation by the number
knots , was known to the Mexicans as well as to the Per
vians, p. 8. and the manner in which the number of uni
is represented in the Mexican paintings in my poflfi,)n
seems to confirm this opinion. They plainly resemble a trin
of knots on a cord or slender rope.

Since 1 publiflled the former Edition, Mr. Waddilove

who is till pleated to continue his friendly attention to procu
me information, has discovered, in the Library of the Efcuria
a volume in folio , confiting of forty sheets of a kind
pasteboard, each the size of a common sheet of writi
paper, with great variety of uncouth and whimsical figur
of Mexican painting, in very fresh colors , and with
explanation in Spanish to most of them. The first twen
two sheets are the signs of the months, days , &c. Abo
the middle of each sheet are two or more large figures
the month, surroundea by the signs of the days. The
eighteen sheets are not so filled with figures. They feemn
be signs of Deities, and images of various objects. Accordi
to this Calendar in the Escurial , the Mexican year contain
286 days, divided into 2z months of days. Each day
rcprefented by a differcnt sign, taken from omen natu
oh jet, a serpent , a dog, a lizard, a reed, a house, &
The igns of days in the Calendar of the Escurial are pr
cic(ly the ftnie with those mentioned by Boturini, Idea,&
p. 4 . But , if we may give credit to that Author, t
Mexican year contained ;6o days, divided into 8 mont
of 20 days. The order of days in every month was colni
ed, according to him , first by what he calls a trildetennl

rogrefilo of days from one to thirteen, in the fme manner
in the Calendar of the Escurial, and then by aptenary
rogrefion of days from one to seven, making in all twenty.
this Calendar, not oly the igns which distinguish each
ay, but the qualities supposed to be peculiar to each month,
emarked. There are certain weaknesses which seem to
company the human mind through every stage of its progress
ob(ervation and science. Slender as was the knowledge of
e Mexicans in Astronomy, it appears to have been already
onneded with judicial Atrology. The fortune and character
persons born in each month are supposed to be decided
some superior influence predominant at the time of nativity.
nce it is foretold in the Calendar, that all who are born
one month will be rich , in another warlike , in a third
xurious , &c. The pasteboard , or whatever ubftance it
v be on which the Calendar in the Escurial is painted ,
ms, by Mr. \Waddilove's description of it , to resemble
early that in the Imperial Library at Vienna. In several
aticulars', the figures bear some likeness to those in the
late which 1 have published. The figures marked D. whlch
duced me to conjecture, that this painting might be a
ibute-roll similar to those published by Purchas and the
chbifhop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove supposes to be signs

servations, as to conclude his opinion to be well founded.
appears, from the charaders in which the explanations of
e figures are written , that this curious monument of
lexican art has been obtained, soon after the conquci of

Empire. It is ingular that it should never have been
ctioned by any Spanish Author.

I AM informed by a perfin who resided long in Nc
Spain, and vilited alnolt every pruvince ol it, that thr

is not, in all the extent of that vast empire, any mo-
nument, or veffige of any building more ancient than the
tonquect, nor of any bridge or highway, except ome
remains of the causeway from Guadaloupe to that gate of
Mexico by which Cortes entered the city. MS. penes me.
The author of another account in manuscript observes,
" That at this day there does not remain even the fialleft
reftige of the existence of any ancient Indian building,
piLblic or private, either in Mexico or in any province of
New Spain. I have travelled, fays he, through all the
countries adjacent to them, viz. New Galicia, New
1ifcay, New Mexico, Sonora, Cinaloa, the New Kingdom
of Leon, and New Santandero, without having observed
any monument worth notice, except the ruins near an
ancient village in the valley de Cadas Grandes, in lat. N.
go. 46'. longit. 28. 24'. from the island of Teneriffe,
or 460 leagues N. N. W. from Mexico. He describes this
minutely, and it appears to have been a paltry building of
urtfand stone, plastered over with white earth or lime. A
"llionary informed that gentleman, that he had discovered
the ruins of another settlement imilar to the former, about
a hundred leagues towards N.W. on the banks of the
River St. Pedro. MIS. penes me.

Those testimonies derive great credit from one cir-
cunftance, that they were not given in support of any parti-
cular fvftem or theory, but as simple answers' to queries
which I had proposed. It is probible, however, that
when these gentlemen aflert, that no ruins or monuments
of any ancient work whatever are now to be discovered in
the Mexican Empire, they meant that there were no such
ruins or monuments as conveyed any idea of grandeur or
magnificence, in the works of its ancient inhabitants. For
it appears from the testimony of several Spanish authors,
thait in Otumba , Tlafcal;a, Cholula, (&c some vestiges of
ancien buildings are still visible. Villa Segnor, Theatro
Amer p 41.. t1o. 1 . D. Fran. Ant lorenzana,

Cortes, which he published at Mexico, mentions some
ruins which arc Itill vilible in several of the towns through
which Cortes paflcd in his way to the capital, p. 4, &c.
Vut neither of there authors give any description of them,
end they feemi to be to very inconliderable, as to show
only that some buiildings had once been there. The large
mount of earth at Cholula, which the Spaniards digniied
with the n.oe of temp)le, still remains , but without any
fleps by which to ascend, or any .facing of ifone. It
appears now like a natural mount, covered with grass and
lhrubs, and poflibly it was never any thing more.
Torquerm. lib. iii. c. 19. 1 have received a minute
description of the remains of a temple near Cuernavaca,
-on the road fr(om Alexico to Acapulco. It is compoed of
large ltones , fitted to each other as nicely as those in the
buildings of the Peruvians, which are hereafter mentioned.
At the foundation it forms a square of zs yards; but as it
rites in height, it diminishes in extent, not gradually, buti
by being contracted suddenly at regular distances, so that
it must have resembled the figure B in the plate. It
terminated, it is said, in a spire.

NOTE XXXI. p. 89.

H E exaggeration of the Spanifl historians, with refpe&

to the number of human victims sacrificed in Mexico,l
appears to be very great. According to Gomara, there!
was no year in which twenty thousand human victims were?
not otlfred to the Mexican Divinities, and in some years,
they amounted to fifty thousand, Chron. c. 229. The'
skulls of those unhappy persons were ranged in order in
a building erected for that purpose, and two of Curtes's
officers who had counted them, informled onmara that their1
number was a hundred and thirty-fix thoufiuld. Ibid. c. 82.
Herrera's account is tIill more incredible, that the number
of victims was ft great, that five thousand have been
sacrificed in one day, nay, on ofme occafiors, no less than

twenty thousand. Dec. iii. lib; ii. c. ix6 Torquemada
goes beyond both in extravagance, for he asserts, that
tweity thouiand children , exclusive of other vidtimss
were laughtered annually. Mun. Irid. lib. vii. c. 2r The
moit respectable authority in favor of fich high nunibers is
that of Zumurraga, the first bililop of Mexico, who in a
letter to rhe chapter general of his order, ,5. D. 6 ,
asserts thtnt the Mexicans sacrificed ar:llillv twenty thoullnd
victims. D;lvila, Teatro cclef. 126. In opposition to all these
accounts, B1 de las Casas obServes, thiat if the're had been
such an annual waste of the human species, the couitry
could never have arrived at that degree of populuf;efs,
for which it vas remarkable when the Spaniards fitIt landed
there. This reasoning is jult If the number of vidtim
in all the provinces of New Spain had been so great, not
only mulf population have been prevented from increasing
but the human race mutl have been exterminated in a
short time. For betides the walte of the species by such
numerous sacrifices, it is observable that wherever the fate
of captives taken in war, is either certain death or perpetual
lavery. as men can gain nothing by ubmitting speedily to
an eem , they always rcfift to the uttermot, and war
becomes bloody and deftrutive to the lall degree. Las
C3fas positively afterts, that the Mexicans never sacrificed
more than fifty or a hundred persons in a year. See his
difpiue with Sepulveda, subjoined to hi's Bievifliina
Relacion, p. oq. Cortes does not specify what number
of victims was sacrificed annually, but B. Dial del Caftello
relates, that an inquiry having been made, with refped
to this, by the Franciscan Monks, who were sent into
New :Spiin immediately after the conquest, it was found
that about two thousand five hundred were sacrificed every
year in Mexico. C 207.

IT is hardly necessary to observe, that the Peruvian
Chronology is not only obscure, but repugnant to conclusions
deduced from the mos accurate and extenlive observations,
concerning the time that'elapfes during each reign, in
any given fucceflion of princes. The medium has been
found not to exceed twenty years. According to Acofta
and Garcilatfo de la Vega, Huana Capac, who died about
the year 1g27, was the twelfth Inca. According to this
rule of computing the duration of the Peruvian monarchy
ought not to have been reckoned above two hundred and
forty years; but they affirm that it had fubfifRed four
hundred years. Acofta, lib. vi. c. r9. Vega, lib. i.
c. 9- By this account each reign is extended at a mediun
to thirty-three years, instead of twenty, the number
ascertained by Sir Isaac Newton's observations; but so
imperfec were the Peruvian traditions, that though the
total is boldly marked, the number of years in each reign,
is unknown,

Peruvians offered human sacrifices. Xeres, p. 190. Zarate

Vega contends , that though this barbarous pratic
prevailed among their uncivilized ancestors, it was totall
abolished by the Incas, and that no human vidim wa
ever offered in any temple of the Sun. This allbrtion
and the plausible reasons with which he confirms it, ar
sufficient to refute the Spanifl writers, whose account
seem to be founded entirely upon report, not upon wha
they themselves had observed. Vega, lib. ii. c. 4. 1
one of their festivals, the Peruvians offered cakes of brea
moistened with blood drawn from the iarms, the e)

brows, and noses of their children. Id. lib. vii c. 6. This
rite may have been derived from their ancient pradtice, in
their uncivilized ate, of sacrificing human vidcims.

NOTE XXXIV. p. 203.

1 HE Spaniards have adopted both those customs of the
ancient Peruvians. They have preserved some of the
aqueducts or canals, made in the days of the Incas, and
have made new ones, by which they water every field
that they cultivate. Ulloa, Voyage, tom. i. 422, 477.

f great extent and solidity. Tom. i. 9 . Three
iricumfilnccs truclk all those observers: the vast fi7.e of

Bb }

the flones which the Peruvians employed in some of their
buildings. Acoft mcafured one, which was thirty feet
long, eighteen broad , and fix in thiclnefs; and yet, he
adds, that in the fortress at Cuzco, there were sones
cofiderably larger. It is difficult to conceive how the
Peruvians could move these, and raise them to the height
even of twelve feet. The second circuniftance is, the
imperfedion of the Peruvian art, when applied to working
in timber. By the patience and perseverance natural to
Americans, stones may be formed into any shape, merely
by rubbing one againlt another, or by the use of hatchets
or other instruments made of stone; but with such rude
tools, little progress can be made in carpentry. The
Peruvians could not mortize two beams together, or give
any degree f union, or flability to any work composed of
timber. As they could not form a centre, they were
totally unacquainted with the use of arches in building,
nor can the Spanish authors conceive how they were
able to frame a roof for those ample ftrudures which they
raised.

The third circuinfmance is a friking proof, which all

the monuments of the Peruvians furnish, of their want of
ingenuity and invention, accompanied with patience no
jess astonishing None of the stones employed in those
works were formed into any particular or uniform shape,
which could render them fit for being compadced together
in building. The Indians took them as they fell from the
mountains, or were raised out of the quarries. Some
were lquare, bonle t iangular, foime convex, some concave.
Their art and indufiry were employed in joining them
together, by forming such hollows in the one, as perfedtl
correlpondcd to the projections or risings in the other.
This tedious operation, which might have been o eafil
abridged, by adapting the surface of the stones to each!
other, either by rubbing, or by their hatchets of coppcr;
would be deemed incredible, if it were not put beyondl
doubt by inpedting the remains of those buildings. I1
gives them a very singular appearance to an European

eve. There is no regular layer or stratum of building
and no one flone refenbles another in dimensions or form.
At the fame time, by the persevering, but ill-direded
indlftry of the Indians, are all joined with that minute
nicety which I have mentioned. Ulloa made this observation
cocerning the form of the stones in the fortress of Sltun-
Cannar. Voy. i. p. 387. Pineto gives a similar description
of the fortress of Cuzco, the most perfed of all the
Peruvian works. Zapata, MS. penes me. According to
M. de la Condamine, there were singular strata of building
hi tome parts of Atun - Cannar , which he remarks as
singular , and as a proof of some progress in improve-
ment.

THE appearance of those bridges, which bend with
their own weight, wave with the wind, and are considerably
aitated by the motion of every person who pases along
them, is very frightful at first. But the Spaniards have
found them to be the easiest mode of palling the torrents
ii Peru, over which it would be difficult to throw more
lolid ftrucdures either of stone or timber. They form those
hanging bridges so strong and broad, that loaded mules
pars along them. All the trade of Cuzco is carried on
by means of such a bridge over the river Apurimac. Ulloa,

in pafling smaller streams: A basket, in which the

. Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated
m causes of the rapid depopulation of Alexico, to which
e gives the name of the Ten Plagues. Many of these
rnot peculiar to that province. i. The introduction of
e fall-pox. This disease was first brought into New
ain in the year 1 20, by a negroe- slave who attended
lrvaez in his expedition against Cortes. Torribio affirms,
at one half of the people in the provinces, visited
th this ditemper, died. To this mortality occaftoaed
the small-pox, Torquemada adds the deftrudive effects
itwo contagious distempers which raged in the years I 54

millions perished, according to an exact account taken

M was not introduced into Peru for several years after

invasion of the Spaniards, but there too that distemper
oved very fatal to the natives. Garcia, Origen, p. 88.
The numbers who were killed or died of famine in
eir war with the Spaniards, particularly during the siege
Mexico. ;. The great famine that followed after the
educdioln of Mexico, as all the people engaged, either on
c sidle or other, had neglected the cultivation of their
ds. Something similar to this happened in all the other

countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous
tasks imposed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging
to their Repartimientos. Â¢. The opprellive burden of
taxes which they were unable to pay, and from which
they could hope for no exemption. 6. The numbers
employed in collecting the gold, carried down by the torrents
from the mountains, who where forced from their own
habitations, without any provilion made for their subsistence
and subjected to all the rigor of cold in those elevate
regions. 7. The immense labor of rebuilding Mexico
which Cortes urged on with such precipitate ardor
as destroyed an incredible number of people. 8. Th
number of people condemned to servitude, under variou
pretexts, and employed in working the silver - mines
These, marked by each proprietor with a hot iron, lik
his cattle, were driven in herds to the mountains. Th
nature of the labor to which they were fubjeded there
the noxious vapors of the mines, the coldness of th
climate, and scarcity of food, were so fatal, tha
Torribio affirms, the country round several of tho
mines, particularly near Guaxago. was covered wit
dead bodies , the air corrupted with their stench, an
so many vultures, and other voracious birds, hovere
about for their prey, that the fun was darkened with thei
flight. xo. The Spaniards, in the different expeditio
which they undertook, and by the civil wars which the
carried on, destroyed many of the natives, whom the
compelled to serve them as Tamnemes, or carriers of burden
This last mode of oppre(fion was particularly ruinous to th
Peruvians. From the number of Indians who perilhed
Gonzalo Pizarro's expedition into the countries to the ea
of the Andes, one may form rome idea of what th
fufrered in similar services, and how fal they were was
by them. Torribio, MS. Corita in his Breve y Sumar

observations, to which he refers. MS. penes me.

NOTE XLV. p. 244.

IT is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of th
'state of population in those kingdoms of Furope where th
police is molt perfect, and where science has made t
greatest progress. In Spanish America, where knowled
is ill in its infancy, and few men have leisure to enga
in researches merely speculative, little attention has bee
paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 741, Phil
V. enjoined the viceroys and governors of the fever
provinces in America , to make an actual survey of t
people under their jurisdiction, and to transmit a repo
concerning their number and occupations. In confequen
of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of N
Spain, appointed D. Jos. Antonio d Villa Segnor y Sanche
to execute that commillion in New Spain. From the repor
of the magillrates in the several diftridts, as well as fro
his own obfcrvations, and long acquaintance with molt

e provinces, Villa Segnor published the result of his
quiries in his Theatro Americano. His report, however,
imperfeCt. Of the nine dioceses, into which the Mexican
npire has been divided, he has published an account of
ie only, viz. the archbishopric of Mexico, the bishoprics
Puebla de los Angeles, Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nueva
alicia. The bishoprics of Yucatan , Verapaz, Chiapa,
nd Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though the two latter
omprehend countries, in which the Indian race is more
numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his survey
the extensive diocese of Nueva Galicia, the ituation of
different Indian villages is described, but he specifies
e number of'people only in a small part of it. The In-
ans of that extensive province, in which the Spanish
ninion is imperfectly etabliihed, are not registered with
e fame accuracy as in other parts of New Spain. Ac-
rding to Villa Segnor, the aual state of population in
e five dioceses above mentioned is of Spaniards, negroes,
lattoes, and meltizos, in the dioceses of

Families,

Los Angeles - - - - 88,2

Nueva Galicia 6,222

294,391

At the rate of five to a family, the total number i:
X.47 1,9sq . We may rely with greater certainty on this
computation of the number of Indians, as it is taken from
the llatricit a, or register, according to which the tributf
paid by them is collected. As four diocefcs of nine arc
totally omitted ,and in that of Nueva Galicia the numbers are
imperfedly recorded, we may conclude, that the number o
Indians in the Mexican empire exceeds two millions.

The account of the number of Spaniards , &c. seems no

to be equally complete. Of many places, Villa Segnor o
serves in general terms, that several Spaniards, negroes, an
people of a mixed race, reside there, without specifying thei
number. If , therefore, we make allowance for these, an
for all who reside in the four dioceses omitted the numbe
of Spaniards , and of those of a mixed race, may probabl
amount to a million and a half. In foine places, Villa Segn
diltinguiihes between Spaniards and the three inferior rac
of negroes, mulattoes, and meitizos, and marks their numb
separately. But he generally blends them together. Butfro
the proportion observable in those places, where the numb
of each is marked, as well as from the account of the fta
of population in New Spain by other authors, it is manife
thar the number of negroes and persons of a mixed race
exceeds that of Spaniards. Perhaps the latter ought not to b
reckoned above oo,ooo to a million of the former.

Defective as this account may be, I have not been ab

to procure such intelligence concerning the number of peop
in Peru, as might enable me to form any conjecture equal
satisfying with rcfpect to the deg- of its population. I ha
been informed. that in the ear 176 , the procetor oft
Indians in the viceroyalty of Peru computed that 612,7S
paid tribute to the king. As all females, and pcrfons und
age, are exempted fiom this tax in Peru, the total numb
of Indians ought, by that account , to be 2,449,12Â°.
pener fie.

I shall mention another nlode by which one

compute, or at leall form a guels , concerning the itate
population in New Spain and Peru. According to an accou

wrhich I have reason to confider as accurate, the number
of copies of the bull of' Cruzada, exported to Peru on each
newpublication, is , , 9 ; t New Spain 2,649,326.
an informed , that but fw Indians purchase bulls , and
that they are fold chiefly to the Spanish inhabitants , and
those of mixed race, so that the number of Spaniards, and
ieople of a mixed race, will amount by this mode of com-
putation to at least three millions.

The number of inhabitants in many of the towns in

Spanish America , may give us some idea of the extent of
population, and correct the inaccurate, but popular notion
ntertained in Great Britain, concerning the weak and desolate
late of their colonies. The city of Mexico contains at. least
io,ooo people. It is remarkable that Torquemada , who
rote his Alonarquzia Izdlianza about the year 16 2, reckons
he inhabitants of Mlexico at that time to be only 7ooo
Spaniards and ooo Indians. Lib. iii. c. 26. Puebla de los
ngeles contains above 60,000 Spaniards, and people of a
mixed race. Villa Segnor , p. 247. Guadalaxara contains
bove 30,000 , exclusive of Indians. Id. ii. 206. Lima
contains 4,oo0. D. Cosine ueno, Defcr. de Peru, 1764.
arthagena contains 2,ooo0. Potofi contains 25,ooo.

287. Towns of a second class are till more numerous. The
ities in the most thriving settlements of other European
rations in America cannot be compared with these.
Such are the detached accounts of the number of people
several towns, which I found scattered in authors whom
thought worthy of credit. But I have obtained an enume-
ation of the inhabitants of the towns in the province of Quito,
the accuracy of which I can rely; and I communicate it
the Public, both to gratify curiosity, and to rectify the
ilaken notion which I have mentioned. St. Francisco de
uito contains between o and 60,000 people of all the
iffercnt races. Betides the city , there are in the Corregi.
ieto 29 curar or parishes established in the principal
illages, each of which has smaller hamlets depending upon
The inhabitants of these are mostly Indians and Mestizos.

St. Juan de Pasto has between 6 and 800o inhabitants
betides 27 dependent villages. St. Mliguel de Ibarra 700
citizens, and ten villages. The diftridt of Havala between l
and ao,ooo people. The diltrid of Tacunna between
and ,ooo. The diftrid of Ambato between 8 and o,oo0
besides 6 depending villages. The city of Riobamba betwee
I6 and o2, ooo inhabitants , and 9 depending villages
The diftric' of Chimbo between 6 and ooo. The city o
Guyaquil from 6 to 20, ooo inhabitants and 14 dependin
villages. The diltrid of Atuafi between q and 6000 , a
4 depending villages. The city of Cuenza between 2 an
3o, ooo inhabitants , and 9 populous depending villages
The town of Laxa from 8 to o, ooo inhabitants, and i
depending villages. This degree of population , though flende
if we confider the vast extent of the country, is far beyon
what is commonly supposed. I have omitted to mention, i
its proper place, that Quito is the only province in Spani
America that can be denominated a manufacturing country
hats, cotton stuffs , and coarse woollen cloths, are mad
there in such quantities, as to be sufficient not only for t
consumption of the province, but to furnish a confiderabl
article for exportation into other parts of Spanish Americ
I know not whether the uncommon industry of this provinc
should be confidered as the cau'e or the effet of its pop
loufnefs. But among the oentatious inhabitants of the Ne
World, the paflion for every thing that comes from Euru
is so violent, that I am informed the manufactures of Qui
are o much undervalued, as to be on the decline.

repeated recommendations , preferment in almost every lin

expires, continue to work in the mines of choice. Entreten.
p. 265. But his opinion concerning the wholefomnefs of
this occupation is contrary to the experience of all ages;
and wherever men are allured by high wages, they will
engage in any species of labor, however fatiguing or
pernicious it may be. D. Hern. Carillo Altemirano relates
a curious fad incompatible with this opinion. Wherever
mines are wrought, fays he., the number of Indians
decreases; but in the province of Campeachy, where there
are no mines, the number of Indians has increased more
thin a third since the conquest of Amnerica, though neither
the foil nor climate be so fvorable as in Peru or Mexico.

T HE strongest proof of this may be deduced from th
laws themselves. By the multitude and variety of regulation
to prevent abuses, e may form an idea of the numbe
of abules that prevail. Though the laws have, wifely
provided that no Indian fiall be obliged to serve in an
mine at a greater distance from his place of relidcnce tha
thirty miles; we are informed in a memorial of ). Herna
Carillo Altamirano presented to the king, that the Indian
of Peru are often compelled to serve in mines at th
dillance of a hundred , a hundred and ifty, and even tw
hundred leagues from their habitation. Colbert, Colled
Mlany mines are situated in parts of the country , so ba
ren, and b diltant from the ordinary lhabitations of th
Indians, that the nccellity of procuring laborers to wr

there, has obliged the Spanish monarchs to dispense with
their own regulations in several instances; and to permit
their viceroys- to compel the people of more remote pro.
vinces to resort to those mines. Efcalona, Gazophyl.
'eruv. lib. i c. 6. But in jullice to them it should be
obferred, that they have been studious to alleviate this
oppression as much as possible, by enjoining the viceroys
to employ every method, in order to induce the Indians
to fettle in some part of the country adjacent to the mines.

I have good reason to believe, that the manners of the
regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are still extremely in.
decent. Acofta himself acknowledges that great corruption
of manners had been the consequence of permitting monks
to forsake the retirement and discipline of the cloister, and
to mingle again with the world, by undertaking the charge
of the Indian parishes. De procur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv.
c, 1 , &c. He mentions particularly those vices, of which
I have taken notice, and confiders the temptations to them
as so formidable, that he leans to the opinion of those who
hold that the regular clergy should not be employed as
parifl priefis. Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for
the regulars admit, that many and great enormities
abounded among the monks of different orders, when set
free from the reitraint of monastic discipline; and from
the tone of their defence , one may conclude that the
charge brought against them was not destitute of truth.
In the French colonies , the state of the regular clergy is
nearly the fame as in the Spanish settlements, and the
fame consequences have followed. M. Biet, superior of
the secular priests in Cayenne, inquires with no less
appearance of piety than of candor, into the causes of
this corruption, and imputes it chiefly to the exemption
of regiulars from the jurifdition and censures of their
diocclfns; to the temptations to which they are exposed;
and to their engaging in commerce. Voy. p. 320. It is

N OT only the native Indians, but the .iefli2zos, or
chilldren of a Spaniard and Indian, were originally excluded
froil the priellhood, and reftied admiflion into any religious
order. But by a law ifued Sept. 28th, 88, Philip I1.
required the prelates of America to ordain such mestizos
born in lawful wedlock, as they should find to be properly
qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any
monaltery where they had gone through a regular noviciate.
Recopil. lib. i. tit. vii. 1. 7. Some regard seems to have
been paid to this law in New Spain; but none in Peru.
Upon a representation of this to Charles 1[. in the year 1697.
he issued a new edict enforcing the observation of it, and
profelling his delire to have all his fubjeds, Indians and
meltizos as well as Spaniards, admitted to the enjoyment
of the fame privileges. Such, however, was the aversion
of the Spaniards in America to the Indians, and their race,
tlat this seems to have produced little effect; for, in the
!ear 172 , Philip V. was obliged to renew the injunction
in a more peremptory tone. But so unsurmountable are the
hatred and contempt of the Indians among the Peruvian
Spaniards, that the present king has been constraincd to
enforce the former edics anew by a law, published Sep-
tember , 1774. Real Cedula, MS. pnes me.

Al. Clavigero has contradited what I have related concern-

ing the cccleiaflical Ifate of the Indians, particularly their
exclulion from the facranent of the Eucharill, and from
hily orders, either as Seculars or Regulars, in such a manner
is cannot fail to make a deep imprellion. He, fiom his own
know(ledge, anlerts, " that in New Spain not only are Indians
permitted to partake of' the sacrament of the altar, but that
Indian pricfis are so numerous that they may be counted by
hundreds; and among thcfe have been many hundreds (of
rectors, canons, and docors, and, as report goes, even a very
learned bilhop. At prcficnt, there are many prielts, and
not a fw rectors, among whom there have been three or
four our own pupils. " Vol. II. 348, &c. 1 owe it thcrc-

fore as a duty to the public, as well as to myself, to
confider each of there points with care, and to explain the
reafors which induced me to adopt the opinion which I
have published.

I knew that in the Chrillian church there is no diftindion

of perlbns, but that men of every nation who embrace the
religion of.Jefus, are equally entitled to every Christian
privilege which they are qualified to receive. I knew, like.
wife, that an opinion prevailed not only among most of the
Spanifi laity fettled in America, but among " many eccle.
fi;iltics, (I use the words ofHerrera, Dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 1i.)
that the Indians were not perfec or rational men, and
were not pofllefed of such capacity as qualified them to
partake of the sacrament of the altar, or of any other benefit
of our religion. " It was against this opinion that Las Casas
contended with the laudable zeal which I have described in
Books 111. and VI. But as the Bishop of Darien, Doctor
Sepulvida, and other refpeftable cclefiaftics, vigoroufy
supported the common opinion concerning the incapacity o
the Indians i became necefary , in order to determine the
point, that the authority of the Holy See should be inter
poscd ; and accordingly Paul 11I. iffhcd a bull A. D. 15t7
in which, as tr condemning the opinion of those who hel
that the Indians, as being on a level with brute beasts
should be reduced to servitude, he declares that they wer
really men, and as such were capable of embracing th
Chriltian religin , and participating of all its bleflings. M
account of' this bull, notwithllanding the cavils of Al. Clavi
qero , must appear jult to every person who takes the troub
of peruling it; and my account is the fame with that adopte
hy Tor(lquem;da, lib). xvi. c. 2z. and by Garcia, Orig. p. i11
I;ut even aser this decilion , so low did the Spaniards refid
ingl in America rate the capacity of the natives , that the fir

lndi;ans to the holy commiunion. Torqucm. lib. xvi. c. 20
In New Spain, the exclulion of Indians from the fcrinier
WVts iill more L.r icit. Ibid. After two centuries hav

elapsed, and notwithstanding all the Improvement that the
Indians may be supposed to have derived from their inter-
course with the Spaniards during that period, we are inform-
ed by D- Ant. Ulloa, that in Peru, where, as will appear
in the sequel of this note, they are supposed to be better
inflruted than in New Spain, their ignorance is so prodi-
gious that very few are permitted to communicate, as being
altogether destitute of the requisite capacity. Voy. I. 34r,
&c. Solorz. Polit. Ind. I. 20o.

With refped to the exclusion of Indians from the

priesthood, either as Seculars or Regulars, we may observe,
that while it continued to be the common opinion that the
natives of America, on account of their incapacity, should
not be permitted to partake of the holy sacrament, we can-
not suppose that they would be clothed with that sacred
character which entitled to consecrate and to dispense it.
When Torqueniada composed his Monarquia Indiana, it
was almost a century after the conquest of New Spain;
and yet in his time, it was still the general practice to
exclude Indians frem holy orders. Of this we have the
most satisfying evidence. Torquemada having celebrated
the virtues and graces of the Indians at great length, and
with all the complacency of a missionary, he farts as an
objecion to what he had asserted, " If the Indians really
pos'ess all the excellent qualities which you have described,
lhy are they not permitted to afume the religious habit ?
Why are they not ordained priers and bishops, as the
Jewish and Gentile converts were in the primitive church,
especially as they might be employed with uch fhperior
advantage to other persons in the infirud'ion of their coun-
trymen ? " Lib. xvii. c. 1;.

In answer to this objection, which eflialifhes, in the

most unequivocal manner, what was the gneral pradtice
at that period, Torqcuenada obfcrvcs, that although by
their natural dispositions the Indians are well fitted for a
filbordinate lituation , they are dcRfitute of all the qualities
reqifite in any fation of dignity and authority; and that
lley are in general so addicted to drunennefs, that, upon

the slightest temptation, one cannot promise on their be.
h.iving with the decency suitable to the clerical character.
The propriety of excluding them from it, on these ac.
counts, was, he observed, so well jultified by experience,
that when a foreigner of great erudition, who came from
Spain , cundemned the practice of the Mexican church,
he was convinced of his miliake in a public disputation
with the learned and molt religious Father ). Juan de
Gaona, and his retractation is still extant. Torquemada,
indeed , acknowledges , as M. Clavigero observes with
a degree of exultation , that, in his time, some Indians
liad been admitted into monasteries; but, with the art of
a disputant, he forgets to mention tlat Torquetnada fpe.
cifics only two examples of this, and takes notice that in
both inIlances those Indians had been admitted by miital.
Relying upon the authority of Torquemada with regard to
New Spain, and of Ulloa with regard to Peru, and con.
fidering the humiliating depreflion of the Indians in all the
Sp:'nifh settlements, I concluded that they were not ad.
mitted into the ecclesiastical order , which is held in the
liigheft veneration all over the New WXorld.

But when . Clavigero, upon his own knowledge, aferted

facVs so repugnant to the conclusion I had formed, I began
to di(truft it, and to wifl for farther information. In order
to obtain this , 1 applied to a Spanish nobleman , high in
oftice, and eminent for his abilities, who, on different occa-
sions , has permitted me to have the honor and benefit of
corresponding with him ; and I requelted my respectable friend
I\r. Lilton, the 3Bitilh \linifter at the court of Madrid , to
mnlie what inquiries he judged proper with relipcct to this
point. Fron the former , I have been favored with the
following anfver. " 'What you have written concerning the
acini!lion of Indians into holy orders , or into monalterics,
in Rook VII . cccially as it is explained and limited ir
'utc I,XXXVIII, of the quarto edition, is in general accurate
and cnlsormable to the authorities which you quote. An'
although the congregation of the council rclflved and declared
Feb. 13, A. 1). 68 , that the circumllancc of bcing a

Indian, a mulatto, or mestizo, did not disqualify any pcirfi:
from being admitted into holy orders, if he was poll'lllc of
what is required by the canons to entitle him to that privilege;
this only proves such ordinations to be legal and valid,( of whiic
Solorzano , and the Spanifhl lawyers and hillorians quoted
by him , Pol. Ind. lib. ii. c. 29.. were pcrfuaded ) , but it
neither proves the propriety of admitting Indians into holy
orders , nor what was then the common practice , with
reflect to this; but , on the contrary , it shows that there
was sone doubt concerning the ordaining of Indians , and
fonme repugnance to it.

"' Since that time, there have been onme examples of

admitting Indians into holy orders. We have now at lMadrid
an aged priest , a native of Tlafcala. Ilis name is D. Juan
Cerilo de Cafiilla Aquihual Catchutle , descended of a Cazique
converted to Chrillianity soon after the conquest. He ludied
the ecclesiastical ciences in a seminary of Puebla de los
Angeles. Het was a candidate , nevertheless, for ten years,
;ind it required much intcreft before Bishop Abren would
content to ordain him. This eccleliaftic is a mal of unex-
ceptionable charader , modest , felf-denied , and v'ith a
competent knowledge of what relates to his clerical functions.
lie came to Madril above thirty- four years ago , with the
sole view of soliciting admillion for the Indians into the
colleges and seminaries in New Spain , that if , after being
tell innfrudted and tried, they Ihould find an inclination to
enter into the eccleli;iflical Itate , they might embrace it ,
;ind perform its functions with the greateli benefit to their
countrynmen, whom they could addrels in their native tongue.
lie h;,s obtained various regulations fvorable to his chemen,
;articularly that the firlt college which becanic vacnnt in
consequence of the exclulion of the Jeluits , floulld e et

t'llmloed in New Spain. Whetcher their oppolition be well
lbunldcd or not, i a problem difficult to resolve, and tovwar;lrt

the solution of which, several diftinAions and modifications
are requilite.

" According to the accounts of this ecclesiastic, and the

information of other persons who have resided in the Spanish
dominions in America , you may reft assured that in the
kingdom of Tierra Firnim no such thing is known as either
an Indian secular priest or monk ; and that in New Spain
there arc very few eccilfiatics of Indian race. In Peru,
perhaps , the number may be greater , as in that country
there are more Indians who polfefs the means of acquiring
such a learned education as is necefflry for persons who aspire
to the clerical character. "

From Mr. Liston, owing to some incidents which it is

tinnecefTary to specify , I have not yet received an answer
to my queries. If the intelligence which, from my experience
of his obliging attention , I certainly expec , hall differ
materially from that which I have already received, I will
not fail to communicate it to the public, and will, without
hesitation or reluctance, make whatever alterations may be
necessary in my narrative. Meanwhile , in Vol. II. p. 286.

TY HEN the mines of Potofi were discovered in the year
I(45, the veins were so near the surface, that the ore was efily
extraded, and so rich that it was refined with little trouble
and at small expense , merely by the ation of fire. This
simple mode of refining by fusion alone continued until the
year 74 , when the use of mercury in refining silver, as
well as gold , was discovered. Those mines having been
wrought without interruption for two centuries, the veins are
now funk so deep , that the expense of extracting the ore
is greatly increased. Betides this , the richness of the ore,
contrary to what happens in most other mines , has become
ess, as the vein continued to dip. The vein has likewise
diminished to such a degree , that one is amazed that the
paniards hould persist in working it. Other rich mines have
een fuccefively discovered, but in general the value of the
res has decreased so much, while the expense of extracting
hem has augmented, that the court of Spain , in the year
1736 , reduced the duty payable to the king from a fifth

a tenth. All the quicksilver used in Peru , is extracted
om the famous mine of Guancabelica , discovered in the
ear is63. The crown has reserved the property of this
line to itself; and the persons who purchase the quicksilver
ay not only the price of it, but likewise a fifth, as a duty
othe king. But, in the yrar 176 , this duty on quicksilver
as abolished , on account of the increase of expense in
orking mines. Ulloa, Entretenimientos, xii.-xv. Voyage,

M ANY remarkable proofs occur of the advanced [ate

The number of cities in Spain was conliderable , and they
were peopled far beyond the proportion that was common
in other parts of Europe. The causes of this I have explained

species of industry which is peculiar to them increases, arti
ficers and manufacturers abound. The effect of the Americar
trade in giving activity to these is nlanifef, from a fingula
fact. In the year IS 4 , while Spain continued to depenc
on its own industry, for the supply of its colonies, o mud
work was bespoke from the manufacturers, that it was fuppofel
they could hardly finish it in less than fix years. Campom

motion, and have excited extraordinary efforts. Accordinly
we are informed , that in the beginning of Philip 11's reiPn

centred , gave employment to no fetrer than x6,ooo loo
in silk or woollen work , and that above go,ooo perfor
had occupation in carrying on there manufactures. Campon

the reigns of Charles V. and Philip II. " Lays he, C< the
nianufaltures of Spain and of the Low Countries subject to
her duminion were in a most flourishing slate. Those of
France and :ngland were in their infancy. The republic of
the United Provinces did rlot then exist. No European power
but Spain had colonies of any value in the New World.
Spain could supply her settlements there with the productions
of her own foil , the fabrics wrought by the hands of her
own artisans, and all she received in return for these belonged
to herself alone. Then the exclusion of foreign manufadures
was proper , because it might be rendered effectual. hen
Spain might lay heavy duties upon goods exported to America,
or imported from it, and might impose what restraints he
deemed proper upon a commerce entirely in her own hands.
But when time and successive revolutions had occasioned an
alteration in all those circumttances, when the manufadures
of Snain began to decline, and the demands of America were
pplied by foreign fabrics , the original maxims and regu-
ations of Spain should have been accommodated to the change
in her situation. The policy that was wife at one period,
became absurd in the other. "

T HE account of the mode in which the factors of the
South-Sea-Company condudted the trade in the fair of
Porto-bello, which was opened to them by the Affiento,
I have taken from Don Dion. Alcedo y Herrera, president
of the court of Audience in Quito, and governor of that
province. Don Dionylio was a pcrfon of such a refpcctahle
character for probity andt dilccrnment, that his tcllimony
in any point, would be of much weight; but greate
crelit is due to it in this cafe, as he was an eye-witncfi
of the transaCtions which he relates, and was often employed
in detecting and authenticating the frauds which hE
cideCribes, It is probable, however, that his representation

being composed at the commencement of the war which
broi:e out between Great Britain and Spain, in the year
7; 9 , may, in some instances, discover a portion of the
acrimonious spirit, natural at that juncture. His detail of
facis is curious; and even English authors confirm it in
some degree, by admitting both tilat various frauds were
pracifed in the tranfaitions of the annual hip , and that
the contraband trade from Jamaica, and other British
crlonics, was become enormously great. But for the credit
of the Engliflh nation it may be observed , that those
lriu:lulent operations are not to be confidered as deeds of
the company, but as the dishonorable arts of their faitors
aind agents. The company itself sustained a considerable
loss by the Aliento trade. Many of its servants acquired
inlmcnfe fortunes. Anderson, Chronol. deduct. ii. 388.

proince of Venezuela, or Caraccas, extends four hundred
miles along the coalt, and is one of the most fertile in
Anmerica ; it was so much neglccted by the Spaniards,
tht during the twenty years prior to the eltablifhlment of
the company, only five flips failed from Spain to that
province; and during r6 years, fromr 1706 to 1722,
not a lingle lhip arrived from the Caraccas in Spain. Noticias

S'ince the commercial operations of the company began in

During eighteen years subsequent to 171 , the number of
',lueeas imported was 869,247; and if we suppose the
itmiport.tion to be continued in the Ilme proportion during
the remainder of thirty years, it will amount to 1,448,746
Fanegas , which is an increase of 8os, Ftiiegas. Id.
p. 148. During eight years subsequent to 756 , there has
been imported into Spain by the Company, 88,482 arrobar
(each twenty-five pounds) of tobacco; and hides to the
number of 177,154. Id. 161. Since the publication of
the Noticias de Campania, in i.6 , its trade seems to
be on the increase. During five years subsequent to 1769,
it has imported I-9,T 6 Fanegas of cacao into Spain,
36,o08 arrobas of tobacco, 75,496 hides, and 221,432
pesos in specie. Canpomanes, ii. 62. The last article
is a proof of the growing wealth of the colony. It receives
cash from Mexico in return fbr the cacao, with which it
supplies that province, and this it remits to Spain, or lays
out in purchasing European goods. But, betides this, the
molt explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of cacao
raised in the province is double to what it yielded in 1711;
the number of its live-flock is more than treble , and its
inhabitants much augmented. The revenue of the bishop,
which arifrs wholly from tithes, has increased from eight
to twenty thousand pefbs. Notic. p. 69. In consequence
of the augmentation of the quantity of cacao imported into
Spain, its price has decreased from eighty pesos for

in their refpedtive difirids , or those most conveniently
1ituated for the exportation of their refpedive productions.
The following fads give a view of the increase of trade in
the settlements to which the new regulations extend. Prior
to the allowance of free trade, the duties colleced in ihe
custom-house at the Havanmah were computed to be
I04,2og pesos annually. During the five years preceding
1774, they rose at a medium to og8,ooo pesos a year.
In Yucatan, the duties have risen from 8,ooo to ir,ooo.
In Hispaniola, from 2,oo0 to ;,6oo. In Porto-Rico,
from ,2o0 to 7,000. The total value of goods imported
fiom Cuba into Spain, was reckoned, in 774 , to be

Artefanos y fu Fomento; the former puh!ifled in 1774,
and the latter in 177 , afford a itriking, proof of this,
Almolt every point of importance with respect to interiot
police, taxation, agriculture , ninut'atures , and trade,
donmetic as well as forcign, is examined in the course of
there works; and there are not many authors, even in
the nations molt eminent for commercial knowledge who
have carried on their inquiries with a more thorough
knowledge of those various fubjedts, and a more perect
freedom from vulgar and national prejudices, or who
have united more happily the calm researches of philosophy,
with the ardent zeal of a public-fpirited citizen. These
books are in high estimation among the Spaniards, and it i|
a decisive evidence of the progress of their own ideas,
that they are capable of relishing an author whose senti.
ments arc so liberal.

T HS price paid for the bull varies according to the
rank of diflircnt perions. Thofi in the lowest order,
who are servants or slaves, pay two reals of plata, or one
shilling; other Spaniards pay eight reals, and those in
public office, or who hold encomiendas, sixteen reals.

to Chilton, an English merchant who resided long in the

the lowest. Hackluyt, iii. 461. The price seems to have

AS Villa Segnor, to whom we are indebted for this 'i-
iorni tion contained in his Theatro Americano, publifhled
in Mexico , A. D. 1746, was acconiptant-gcncral in one of
the nlolt considerable departments of the royal revenue,
ndcl by that means had access to proper information, his
teftiniony with rcfpcdt to this point merits great credit. No
lic:h aiccurat detail of the Spanish revenues in any part of
linicrica, has hitherto been publifled in the English language,

and the particulars of it may appear curious and interesting
to some of my readers.

This fum amounts to 819,16i 1. Sterling; and if ve

add to it the profit accruing fiomn the file of ooo quintals
of quicksilver imported from the mines of Alnaden, in
Spain, on the king's account, and what accrues from the
Averia, and some other taxes which Villa Scgnor does not
estimate, the public revenue in New Spain may well be
reckoned above a million pounds sterling money. Theat.
Mex. vol. i.p. ; 3 , &c. According to Villa Segnor,
the total produce of the Miexican mines, amounts at a
medium to eight millions of pesos in silver annually, and
to 592 marks of gold. Ib. p. 44. Several branches of

the revenue have been explained in the course of the hiflorv;
fune, which there was no occasion of mentioning, require
a particular illuflration. The right to the tithics in the New
W'orld, is veted in the crown of Spain , by a bull of
Alexander VI. Charles V. appointed them to be applied in
the following manner: One fourth is allotted to the bishop
of the diocese , another fourth to the deun and chapter
and other officers of the cathedral. The remaining half is
divided into nine equal parts. Two of these, under the
denomination of los dos Novenns realcs, are paid to the
crown , and constitute a branch of the royal revenue. The
other seven parts are applied to the maintenance of the
parochial clergy, the building and support of churches, and
other pious uses. lRecopil. lib. i. tit. xvi. Ley. 23, &c.
Avendano, Thefaur. Indic. vol. i. p. 184.

The Alcavala is a duty levied by an excise on the fle
of goods. In Spain it amounts to ten per cent. In America,
to four per cent. Solorzano, Polit. Indiana, lib. vi. c. 8.
Avendano, vol. i. ir6.

The Alrlajlooifajgo, or custom paid in America on goods

imported and exported, may amount on an average to fifteen
per cent. Recopil. lib. viii. tit. xiv. Ley. . Avendano,
vol. i. i8gC.

Tihe Averia, or tax paid on account of convoys to guard
the ships failing to and from America, was first imposed
wdlen Sir Francis Drake filled the New \World with terror
by his expedition to the South-Sea. It amounts to two per
cent. on the value of goods. Avendano, vol. i. p. 189.
Hecopil. lib. ix. tit. ix. Ley. 4, 44.

I have not been able to procure any accurate detail of

the several branches of revenue in Peru , later than the
yecar 1614. From a curious manuscript, containing a
state of that vice-royalty in all its departments, presented
to the Malrquis of lontes-Claros, by Franc. Lopez Ca-
raintes , accomptant-general in the tribunal of Lima, it
"Ppears, that the public revenue, as nearly as I can
cotmpute the value of the money in which Caravantes

states his accounts, amounted in ducats at
4 s. d., to -2,317,769

Expenses of government - - 1,24,992

Net free revenue 1,129,776

The total in sterling money - L, 83;,o
Expenses of government - - 30o,68

Net free revenue 277,7 3

But several articles appear to be omitted in this compu.

tation, uch as the duty on flamped paper, leather, eccle.
fialtical annats, &c. so that the revenue of Peru may be well
supposed equal to that of Mexico.

In computing the expense of government in New Spain,

I may take that of Peru as a standard. There the annual
eftahlifhment for defraying the charge of administration,
exceeds one half of the revenue collected, and there is no
reason for supposing it to be less in New Spain.

I have obtained a calculation of the total amount of the

public revenue of Spain from America and the Philippines,
which, as the reader will perceive from the two lalt articles,
is more recent than any of the furmer.

Alcavalas ( Excise ) and Aduanas ( Cuf-

AN author , long conversant in commercial speculation ,
has computed , that from the mines of New Spain alone,
the king receives annually , as his fifth , the fum of two
millions of our money. flarris, Collectt. of Voy. ii. p. 164.
According to this calculation, the total produce of the mines
nuft be ten millions ftcrling ; a fum to exorbitant, and so
lirtle corresponding with all accounts of the annual importa-
tion from America, that the information on which ic is
founded must evidently be erroneous. According to Campo-
mni;cs , the total product of the American mines may be
computed at thirty millions of pesos, which , at four shillings
and lix pence a pcfo , amounts to 7,42, ooo 1. iterling, the
in!'s fifth of which ( if that were regularly paid ) would be
1,48l,ooo 1. But from this fum the cxpcrfe of adminiftra-
tion is to be dcdutced , which is very conliderable, as ap-
pelars from the preceding note. Educ. popular , vol. ii. p. 3 1.

NOTE LXXI. p. 340.

ACCORDING to Bern. de Ulla , all foreign goods ex-
ported from Spain to America pay duties of various kinds,
amounting in all to m:ire than 2s per cent. As mofl of the
goods with which Spain supplies her colonies are foreign;
such a tax upon a trade so extensive must yield a considerable
revenue. Retab. des Manus. & du Commerce d'Efp. p. iso.
He computes the value of goods exported annually from Spain
to America , to be about two millions and a half sterling,
p. 97.

NOTE LXXV. p. 342.

T HE Marquis de Serralvo , according to Gage, by
monopoly of salt , and by embarking deeply in the Manila
trade as well as in that to Spain, gained annually a million
of ducats. In one year he remitted a million of ducats to
Spain, in order to purchase from the Conde Olivares, and
his creatures , a prolongation of his government, p. 61. He
was successful in his suit, and continued in office from 1624
to 635, double the usual time.
