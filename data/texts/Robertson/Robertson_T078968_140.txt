# PREFACE.

PREFACE.
N fulfilling the engagement which I had

come under to the Public with refpcc to

the History of America, it was my intention
not to have publlifled any part of the work
until the whole was completed. The present
state of the British Colonies has induced me
to alter that resolution. While they are en-
gaged in civil war with Great Britain, inqui-
ries and speculations concerning their ancient
forms of policy and laws, which exist no
longer, cannot be interesting. The attention
and expectation of mankind are now turned
towards their future condition. In whatever
manner this unhappy contest may terminate,
a new order of things must arise in North
America, and its affairs will assume another
afpe&. I wait, with the solicitude of a good
citizen, until the ferment subside, and regular
government be re-eflablifhed, and then I shall
return to this part of my work, in which I had
made some progress. That, together with the
history of Portuguese America, and of the fettle-
ments made by the fcveral nations of Europe in
the Weft India islands, will complete my plan.

VOL. T. a TiHE

TIE three volumes which I now publifdr

contain an account of the discovery of the
New World, and of the progtefs of the Spa-
nifh arms and colonies there. This is not
only the most splendid portion of the Amerir-
can story, but so much detached, as, by itself,
to form a perfect whole, remarkable for the
unity of the fubjedt. As the principles and
maxims of the Spaniards in planting colonies,
which have been adopted in some measure
by every nation, are unfolded in this part of
my work; it will serve as a proper introduc-
tion to the history of all the European efta-r
blifhments in America, and convey such in-
formation concerning this important article of
policy, as may be deemed no less interesting
than curious.

IN describing the atchievements and infli-

tutions of the Spaniards in the New World,
I have departed in many instances from the
accounts of preceding hilforians, and have
often related facts which seem to have been
unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the
Public to mention the sources from which I
have derived such intelligence, as justifics me
either in placing tranfadions in a new light,
or in forming any new opinion with. refpef

,to

to their causes and effects. This duty I per-
form with greater fatisfaaion, as it will afford
an opportunity of expressing my gratitude to
those btenefadors, who have honoured me with
their countenance and aid in my researches.

As it was from Spain that I had to expe&

the most important information, with regard
to this part of my work, I considered it as
a very fortunate circumstance for me, when
Lord Grantham, to whom I had the honour
of being personally known, and with whose
liberality of fntimnent, and disposition to
oblige, I was well acquainted, was appointed
ambassador to the court of Madrid. Upon
applying to him, I met with such a reception
as satisfied me that his endeavours would be
employed in the most proper manner, in or-
der to obtain the gratification of my wishes;
and I am pcrfctly fenlible, that what pro-
grcfs I have made in my inquiries among the
Spaniards, ought to be ascribed chiefly to
their knowing how much his Lordlhip inte-
refted himself in my success.

BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord

Grantham, than the advantages which I have
derived from his attention in engaging Mr.
WVa4dilove, the chaplain of his embassy, to

a 2 take

take the conduct of my literary inquiries in
Spain, the obligations I lie under to him
would be very great. During five years,
that gentleman has carried on researches for
my belloof, with such activity, perseverance,
and knowledge of the fuljeEt, to which his
attention was turned, as have filled me with
no less astonishment than fatisfadion. He
procured for me the greater part of the Spa-
nifh books, which I have consulted; and as
many of them were printed early in the fix-
teenth century, and are become extremely
rare, the collecting of these was such an occu-
pation, as, alone, required much time and
afliduity. To his friendly attention I am in-
debted for copies of several valuable manu-
scripts, containing fats and details which I
might I have searched for in vain, in works
that have been made public. Encouraged by
the inviting good-will with which Mr. Wad-
dilovc conferred his favours, I tranfinittcd to
him a set of queries, with respect both to the
customs and policy of the native Americans,
and the nature of several injtitutions in the
Spanish fettlelnents, framed in such a manner,
that a Spaniard might answer them, without
disclosing any thing that was improper to be
communicated to a foreigner. He translated
thefi into Spanifli, and obtained from various

10 persons

persons who had resided in most of the Spa-
nifh colonies, such replies as have afforded
me much inftrution.

NOTWITHSTANDING those peculiar ad-

vantages with which my inquiries were
carried on in Spain, it is with regret I am
obliged to add, that their success must be
ascribed to the beneficence of individuals, not
to any communication by public authority.
By a single arrangement of Philip II. the re-
cords of the Spanish monarchy are deposited
in the Archivo of Simancas, near Valladolid,
at the distance of a hundred and twenty miles
from the feat of government, and the supreme
courts of justice. The papers relative to
America, and chiefly to that early period of
its history, towards which my attention was
direaed, are so numerous, that they alone,
according to one account, fill the largest apart-
ment in the Archivo; and according to an-
other, they compose eight hundred and seventy-
three large bundles. Conscious of poffefling,
in some degree, the industry which belongs
to an historian, the profpet of such a treasure
excited my molt ardent curiosity. But the
profpct of it, is all that I have .enjoyed.
Spain, with an excess of caution, has uni-
formly thrown a veil over her tranfadions

in

in America. From firangers they are con-
cealed with peculiar iblicilude. Even to her
own fubjeds the Archivo of Simancas is not
opened without a particular order from the
crown ; and after obtaining that, papers can-
not be copied, without paying fees of of-
fice f6 exorbitant, that the expence exceeds
what it would be proper to bestow, when
the gratification of literary curiosity is tile
only object. It is to be hoped, that the Spa-
niards will at lass discover this system of con-
ccalnent to be no less impolitic tlan illiberal.
From what I have experienced in the course
of my inquiries, I am satisfied, that upon a
more minute scrutiny into their early opera-
tions in the New World, however reprehen-
fible the actions of individuals may appear,
the conduct of the nation will be placed in a
more favourable light.

IN other parts of Europe very different

fentimcnts prevail. Having searched, with-
out success, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes to
Charles V. written soon after he landed in the
Mexican empire, which has not hitherto been
publifled ; it occurred to me, that as the em-
peror was setting out for Germany at the time
when the messengers fiom Cortes arrived in
Europe, thie lettcr with which thb!y were in-

9 truitcd

trusted might poflibly be preserved in the
Imperial library of Vienna. I communicated
this idea to Sir Robert Murray Keith, with
whom I have long. had the honour to live in
friendihip, and I had soon the pleasure to
learn, that upon his application, her Imperial
Majesty had been graciously pleased to iifue
an order, that not only a copy of that letter
(if it were found), but of any other papers in
the library, which could throw light upon
the Hiflory of America, should be transmited
to me. The letter from Cortes is not in the
Imperial library, but an authentic copy, at-
tefled by a notary, of the letter written by
the magistrates of the colony planted by him
at Vera Cruz, which I have mentioned, Vol. ii.
p. 269, having been found, it was tranf-
cribed and sent to me. As this letter is no
lets curious, and as little known as that which
was the object of my inquirics, I have given
some account, in its proper place, of what is
most worthy of notice in it. Together with
it, I received a copy of a letter from Cortes,
containing a long account of his expedition to
Honduras, with refpced to which, I did not
think it nccefary to enter into any particular
detail; and likcwiie thofi curious Mexican
paintings, which 1 have described, Vol. iii.
p. '73.

Mi'

MY inquiries at St. Peteriburgh were car-

ried on with equal facility and success. In
examining into the nearest communication
between our continent and that of America,
it became of consequence to obtain authentic
information concerning the discoveries of the
Ruffians in their navigation from Kamchatka
towards the coast of America. Accurate re-
lations of their first voyage, in I741, have
been published by Muller and Gmelin. Se-
veral foreign authors have entertained an
opinion, that the court of Russia studiously
conceals the progress which has been made by
more recent navigators, and suffers the Public
to be amused with false accounts of their
route. Such conduct appeared to me unfuit-
able to those liberal sentiments, and that pa-
tronage of science, for which the present so-
vereign of Russia is eminent; nor could I dif-
cern any political reason, that might render
it improper to apply for information concern-
ing the late attempts of the Ruffians to open a
communication between Asia and America.
My ingenious countryman, Dr. Rogerfon,
first physician to the empress, presented my
request to her Imperial Majesty, who not only
dilclaimed any idea of concealment, but in-
flantly ordered the journal of Captain 'Krenit-
zin, who conducted the only voyage of dif-

covcry

covery made by public authority since the
year x74I, to be translated, and his original
chart to be copied for my use. By consulting
them, I have been enabled to give a more ac-
curate view of the progress and extent of the
Ruffian discoveries, than has hitherto been
communicated to the Public.

FROM other quarters I have received in-

formation of great utility and importance.
M. le Chevalier de Pinto, the minister from
Portugal to the court of Great Britain, who
commanded for several years at Matagroffo,
a Setrtement of the Portuguese in the interior
part of Brazil, where the Indians are nume-
rous, and their original manners little altered
by intercourse with Europeans, was pleated to
fend me very full answers to some queries
concerning the character and inflitutions of
the natives of America, which his polite re-
ception of an application made to him in my
name, encouraged me to propose. These fa-
tisfied me, that he had contemplated with a
discerning attention the curious objects which
his firuation presented to his view, and I have
often followed him as one of my beft-inftrut-
ed guides.

M. SUARD, to whose elegant translation of
the History of the Reign of Charles V. I owe

OL , I. b the

the favourable reception of that work on the
continent, procured me answers to the fame
queries from M. de Bougainville, who had
opportunities of observing the Indians both
of North and South America, and from LL.
Godin le Jeune, who resided fifteen years
among Indians in Quito, and twenty years
in Cayenne. The latter are more valuable
from having been examined by M. de la
Condamine, who, a few weeks before his
death, made some short additions to them,
which may be confidered as the lass effort of
that attention to science which occupied a long
life.

My inquiries were not confined to one

region in America. Governor Hutchinson
took the trouble of recommending the confi.
deration of my queries to Mr. Hawley and
Mr. Brainerd, two protefiant miflionaries,
employed among the Indians of the Five
Nations, who favoured me with answers,
which discover a considerable knowledge of
the people whose customs they describe. From
William Smith, Efq. the ingenious historian
of New York, I received tome useful informa-
tion. When I enter upon the Hiflory of our
Colonies in North America, I shall have oc-
cation to acknowledge how much I have been

indebtcd

indebted to many other gentlemen of that
country.

FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages

made by Alexander Dalrymple, Efq. with
whose attention to the History of Navigation
and Discovery the Public is well acquainted,
I have received some very rare books, parti-
cularly two large volumes of Memorials,
partly manuscript, and partly in print, which
were presented to the court of Spain during
the reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV. From
these I have learned many curious particulars
with refpeE to the interior state of the Spa-
nifh colonies, and the various schemes formed
for their improvement. As this Collecion
of Memorials formerly belonged to the Colbert
Library, I have quoted them by that title.

ALL those books and manuscripts I have

consulted with that attention which the re.
sped due from an Author to the Public re-
quired; and by minute references to them,
I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever
I relate. The longer I reflet on the nature
of historical composition, the more I am con-
vinced that this scrupulous accuracy is necef-
fary. The historian who records the events
of his own time, is credited in proportion to

b 2 the

the opinion which the Public entertains with
refped to his means of information and his
veracity. lie who delineates the tranfaaions
of a remote period, has no title to claim
assent, unless he produces evidence in proof
of his assertions. Without this, he may
write an amusing tale, but cannot be said to
have composed an authentic history. In those
sentiments I have been confirmed by the opi-
nion of an Author*, whom his industry,
erudition, and diicernincnt, have deservedly
placed in a high rank among the most emi-
nent hiltorians of thc age. Emboldened by
a hint from him, I have published a catalogue
of the Spanish books which I have consulted.
This practice was frequent in the last century,
and was confidered as an evidence of laudable
industry in an author; in the present, it may,
perhaps, be deemed the effet of ostentation;
but as many of there books are unknown in
Great Britain, I could not otherwise have re-
fcrred to them as authorities, without encum-
bering the page with an insertion of their full
titles. To any person who may chute to fol-
low me in this path of inquiry, the catalogue
,lutLL be very ufcful.

Mr, GibLon.

Mr

MY readers will observe, that in men.

tioning fums of money, I have uniformly
followed the Spanish method of computing
by pesos. In America, the peso fuerte, or
duro, is the only one known, and that is
always meant when any fum imported from
America is mentioned. The peso fuerte, as
well as other coins, has varied in its nume-
rary value but 1 have been advised, with-
out attending to such minute variations, to
confider it as equal to four hillings and
sixpence of our money. It is to be remem-
bered, however, that in the sixteenth cen.
tury, the effective value of a peso, i. e. the
quantity of labour which it reprefleted, or
of goods which it would purchase, was five
or fix times as much as at present,

N. B. Since this edition was put into the

press, a History of Mexico, in two volumes
in quarto, translated from the Italian of the
Abbe D. Francesco Saverio Clavigero, has
been published. From a person, who is a
native of New Spain, who has resided forty
years in that country, and who is acquaint-
ed with the Mexican language, it was nas
tural to expet much new information.
Upon perusing his work, however, I find

b 3 that

that it contains hardly any addition to the
ancient History of the Mexican empire, as
related by Acofta and Herrera, but what is
derived from the improbable narratives and
fanciful conjectures of Torquemada and Bo-
turini. Having copied their splendid de-
ifriptions of the high ltate of civilization in
the Mexican empire, M. Clavigero, in the
abundance of his zeal for the honour of his
native country, charges me with having mif.
taken some points, and with having mifre-
presented others, in the History of it. When
an author is conscious of having exerted in-
duftry in research and impartiality in decision,
he may, without prefunption, claim what
praise is due to these qualities, and he cannot
be insensible to any accusation that tends to
weaken the force of his claim. A feeling of
this kind has induced me to examine such
ltrictures of M. Clavigero on my EHitory of
America as merited any attention, especially
as these are made by one, who seemed to pof.
fess the means of obtaining accurate informa-
tion; and to ihew that, the greater part of
them is destitute of any just foundation. This
I have done in notes upon the pafliges in my
Hitory, which gave rife to his criticisms

pling the various parts of the earth, has been -

extremely flow. Several ages elapsed before they 'h1arhh
removed far from those mild and fertile regions peopled.
in which they were originally placed by their
Creator. The occasion of their first general dif-
perfion is known; but we are unacquainted with
the course of their migrations, or the time when
they took poffelfion of the different countries which
they now inhabit. Neither history nor tradition
furnish such information concerning those remote
events, as enables us to trace, with any certainty,
the operations of the human race in the infancy of
society.

WE may conclude, however, that all the early Firamigra

tions by
migrations of mankind were made by land. The la,,d

as the various arms of the sea which separate one
region from another, though destined to facilitate
the communication between distant countries, seem,
at first view, to be formed to check the progress of
man, and to mark the bounds of that portion of
the globe to which nature had confined him. It
was long, we may believe, before men attempted
to pass there formidable barriers, and became so
Ikilful and adventrous as to commit themselves to
the mercy of the winds and waves, or to quit their
native Ihores in quest of remote and unknown re-
gions.

Fir/t at- NAVIGATION and fLip-building are arts so nice
tempts to- ,

ards navi. and complicated, that they require the ingenuity,
sation. as well as experience, of many successive ages to

b ing them to any degree of perfe&ion. From the
last or canoe, which first served to carry a savage
over the river that obltruAcd him in the chace, to
the conftrution of a veflel capable of conveying a
numerous crew with safety to a ditlant coast, the
progress in improvement is immense. Many efforts
would be made, many experiments would be tried,
and much labour as well as invention would be
employed, before men could accomplish this ardu-
ous and important undertaking. The rude and im-
perfect Iate in which navigation is fill found
among all nations which are not considerably civil-
ized, corresponds with this account of its progress,

7 and

and demonstrates that, in early times, the art was B O O K
not so far improved as to enable men to undertake . _
distant voyages, or to attempt remote discoveries.

As soon, however, as the art of navigation be- Introduc-

came known, a new species of correspondence commerce.
among men took place. It is from this ara, that
we mult date the commencement of such an inter-
course between nations as deserves the appellation
of commerce. Men are, indeed, far advanced in
improvement before commerce becomes an objec
of great importance to them. They must even
have made some considerable progress towards ci-
vilization, before they acquire the idea of property,
and ascertain it so perfecly as to be acquainted
with the most simple of all contracts, that of ex-
changing by barter one rude commodity for ano-
ther. But as soon as this important right is efta-
blifhed, and every individual feels that he has an
exclusive title to possess or to alienate whatever he
has acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the
wants and ingenuity of his nature suggest to him a
new method of increasing his acquisitions and en-
joyments, by disposing of what is superfluous in his
own tfores, in order to procure what is necessary or
desirable in those of other men. Thus a commer-
cial intercourse begins, and is carried on among
the members of the fame community. By degrees,
they discover that neighbouring tribes possess what
they themselves want, and enjoy comforts of which

B a they

B O 0 K they wish to partake. In the fame mode, and

1.
a-_ upon the fame principles, that domestic traffic is

carried on within the society, an external commerce
is efihblifled with other tribes or nations. Their
mutual interest and mutual wants render this inter-
courle desirable, and imperceptibly introduce the
maxims and laws which facilitate its progress and
render it secure. But no very extensive commerce
can take place between contiguous provinces, whose
foil and climate being nearly the lame, yield fimi-
'lar productions. Rcinote countries cannot convey
their commodities by land, to those places, where
on account oftheir rarity thtv are desired, and be-
come valuable. It is to navigation that men are
indebted for the power of transporting the super-
fluous Itock of one part of the earth, to supply the
wants of another. The luxuries and blessings of a
particular climate are no longer confined to itself
alone, but the enjoyment of them is communica-
ted to the mnoft distant regions.

IN proportion as the knowledge of the advan-

tlges derived from navigation and commerce con-
tinued to spread, the intcrcourfe among nations ex-
tended. The ambition of conquest, or the necef-
fity of procuring new settlements, were no longer
the sole motives of visiting distant lands. The de-
fire of gain became a new incentive to activity,
routed adventurers, and ient them forth upon long
voyages, in fearcll of countries, whole products or

4 wants

wants might increase that circulation, which nou- B o o K
rilhes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade i.
proved a great source of discovery, it opened un-
known seas, it penetrated into new regions, and
contributed more than any other cause, to bring
men acquainted with the situation, the nature, and
commodities of the different parts of the globe.
But even after a regular commerce was established
in the world, after nations were considerably civil-
ized, and the sciences and arts were cultivated with
ardour and success, navigation continued to be so
imperfect, that it can hardly be said to have ad-
vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement in
the ancient world,

AMONG all the nations of antiquity the ftrufture Imperfec-

tion of 11.

of their velrels was extremely rude, and their me- vigrtion
thod of working them very defective. They were anic.nt,.:
unacquainted with several principles and operations
in navigation, which are now confidered as the first
elements on which that science is founded. Though
that property of the magnet, by which it attraets
iron, was well known to the ancients, its more im-
portant and amazing virtue of pointing to the poles
had entirely escaped their observation. Destitute
of this faithful guide, which now conduts the pilot
with so much certainty in the unbounded ocean,
during the darkness of night, or when the heavens
are covered with clouds, the ancients had no other
method of regulating their course than by obferv-

a3 ing

B o o K ing the fun and stars. Their navigation was of
A, - consequence uncertain and timid. They durst fel-

dom quit fight of land, but crept along the coast,
exposed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the
obftruAions, unavoidable in holding such an auk-
ward course. An incredible length of time was re-
quifite for performing voyages, which are now
finilhed in a short space. Even in the mildest cli-
mates, and in seas the least tempestuous, it was
only during the summer months that the ancients
ventured out of their harbours. The remainder of
the year was loft in inacivity. It would have been
deemed most inconsiderate rashness to have braved
the fury of the winds and waves during winter .

WHILE both the science and pra&tice of naviga-

tion continued to be so defeEtive, it was an under-
taking of no small difficulty and danger to visit any
remote region of the earth. Under every difad-
vantage, however, the acive spirit of commerce

lavigation exerted itself. The Egyptians, soon after the efta-
and com-
merceof blifhment of their monarchy, are said to have
tansy' opened a trade between the Arabian Gulph or

Red Sea, and the western coast of the great Indian
continent. The commodities which they imported
from the east, were carried by land from the Ara-
bian Gulph to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed
down that river to the Mediterranean. But if the
Egyptians in early times applied themselves to com-

merce,

merce, their attention to it was of short duration. B O O K
The fertile foil and mild climate of Egypt pro- -X .
duced the necessaries and comforts of life with
such profusion, as rendered its inhabitants so inde-
pendent of other countries, that it became an efta-
blilhed maxim among that people, whose ideas and
institutions differed in almost every point from
those of other nations, to renounce all intercourse
with foreigners. In consequence of this, they
never went out of their own country; they held all
sea-faring persons in detestation, as impious and
profane; and fortifying their own harbours, they
denied itrangers admittance into them b. It was in
the decline of their power, and when their venera-
tion for ancient maxims had greatly abated, that
they again opened their ports, and refilmed any
communication with foreigners.

THE characer and situation of the Phenicians OfthePhe-

were as favourable to the spirit of commerce and icans.
discovery as those of the Egyptians were adverle to
it. They had no difinguilhing peculiarity in their
manners and institutions; they were not addi&ed
to any singular and unsocial form of superstition;
they could mingle with other nations without
scruple or relutance. The territory which they
possessed was neither large nor fertile. Commerce
was the only source from which they could derive

B 4 opulence

B 01o K opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade car-
~ - eried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was

more extensive and enterprising than that of any
Irate in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe-
nicians, as well as the object of their policy and the
spirit of their laws, were entirely commercial.
They were a people of merchants who aimed at the
empire of the sea, and actually poffefled it. Their
lhips not only frequented all the ports in the Me-
diterranean, but they were the firit who ventured
beyond the ancient boundaries of navigation, and
palling the Streights of Gades, visited the western
coatts of Spain and Africa. In many of the places
to which they retorted, they planted colonies, and
communicated to the rude inhabitants some know-
ledge of their arts and improvements. While they
extended their discoveries towards the north and
the weft, they did not neglect to penetrate into the
more opulent and fertile regions of the Ibuth and
call. Havingrendered themselves maLters offeve-
ral commodious harbours towards the bottom of
the Arabian Gulph, they, after the example of the
Egyptians, eltablifhed a regular intercourse with
Arabia and the continent of India on the one hand,
and with the eastern coast of Africa on the other.
From thef countries they imported many valuable
commodities, unknown to the reft of the world,
and, during a long period, engrossed that lucrative
branch of commerce without a rival .

c See NOTE I. at the End of the Volume.

THE

THE vast wealth which the Phenicians acquired B o K

by monopolizing the trade carried on in the Red - _
Sea, incited their neighbours the Jews, under the OfteJ".
prosperous reigns of David and Solomon, to aim
at being admitted to some share of it. This they
obtained, partly by their conquest ofIdumea, which
firetches along the Red Sea, and partly by their
alliance with Hiram king of Tyre. Solomon fit-
ted out fleets, which, under the diretion of Pheni,
cian. pilots, failed from the Red Sea to Tarlhifl
and Ophir. These it is probable were ports in In-
dia and Africa which their conductors were ac-
cufiomed to frequent, and from them the Jewish
ships returned with such valuable cargoes as fud-
denly diffused wealth and splendour through the
kingdom of Ifraeld. But the singular institutions
of the Jews, the observance of which was enjoined
by their divine legislator, with an intention of pre-
serving them a separate people, uninfeaed by ido-
latry, formed a national charater incapable of that
open and liberal intercourse with trangers which
commerce requires. Accordingly, this unibcial
genius of the people, together with the disasters
which besel the kingdom of Israel, prevented the
commercial spirit which their monarchs laboured to
introduce, and to cherish, from spreading among
them. The Jews cannot be numbered among the

nations

B oo oK nations which contributed to improve navigation,

^or to extend discovery.

Of the Car- BUT though the inftru&ions and example of the
tagians. Phenicians were unable to mould the manners and

temper of the Jews, in opposition to the tendency of
their laws, they transmitted the commercial spirit
with facility, and in full vigour, to their own de-
fcendants the Carthaginians. The commonwealth
of Carthage applied to trade and to naval affairs,
with no less ardour, ingenuity, and success, than its
parent state. Carthage early rivalled, and soon
surpassed Tyre, in opulence and power, but seems
not to have aimed at obtaining any Ihare in the
commerce with India. The Phenicians had en.
grofled this, and had such a command of the Red
Sea, as secured to them the exclusive poleffelon of
that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial
activity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another
diretlion. Without contending for the trade of the
east with their mother-country, they extended their
navigation chiefly towards the weft and north.
Following the course which the Phenicians had
opened, they passld the Streights of Gades, and
pushing their discoveries far beyond those of the
parent state, visited not only all the coasts of Spain,
but those of Gaul, and penetrated at last into Bri-
tain. At the fame time that they acquired know-
ledge of new countries in this part of the globe,

they

they gradually carried their researches towards the B o o K
South. They made considerable progress, by land, i
into the interior provinces of Africa, traded with
some of them, and fubje6ted others to their em-
pire. They failed along the western coast of that
great continent, almost to the tropic of Cancer,
and planted several colonies, in order to civilize the
natives, and accustom them to commerce. They
discovered the Fortunate Islands, now known by
the name of the Canaries, the utmost boundary of
ancient navigation in the western ocean'.

NOR was the progress of the Phenicians and
Carthaginians in their knowledge of the globe,
owing entirely to the desire of extending their
trade from one country to another. Commerce
was followed by its usual effets among both these
people. It awakened curiosity, enlarged the ideas
and desires of men, and incited them to bold enter-
prises. Voyages were undertaken, the sole objec
of which was to discover new countries, and to ex-
plore unknown seas. Such, during the prosperous
age of the Carthaginian republic, were the famous
navigations of Hanno and Himilco. Both their
fleets were equipped by authority of the senate, and
at public expence. Hanno was direced to ftcer
towards the south, along the coast of Africa, and
he seems to have advanced much nearer the equi-

no&ial

B 0o K notial line than any former navigator . Himilco
X _, * had it in charge to proceed towards the north, and

to examine the western coasts of the European con-
tinent g. Of the fame nature was the extraordinary
navigation of the Phenicians round Africa. A
Phenician fleet, we are told, fitted out by Necho
king of Egypt, took its departure about fix hundred
and four years before the Christian ara, from a port
in the Red Sea, doubled the Southern promontory
of Africa, and after a voyage of three years, re-
turned by the Streights of Gades, to the mouth of
the Nileh. Eudoxus of Cyzicus is said to have
held the fame course, and to have accompliihed
the fame arduous undertaking '.

THESE voyages, if performed in the manner

which I have related, may justly be reckoned the
greatelf effort of navigation in the ancient world;
and if we attend to the imperfect fate of the art at
that time, it is difficult to determine, whether we
should moll admire the courage and sagacity with
which the delign was formed, or the condu&a and
good fortune with which it was executed. But un-
fortunately, all the original and authentic accounts

of

of the Phenician and Carthaginian voyages, whether B o 0 K
undertaken by public authority, or in prosecution . '-_
of their private trade, have perished. The in-
formation which we receive concerning them from
the Greek and Roman authors, is not only obscure
and inaccurate, but, if we except a Ihort narrative
of Hanno's expedition, is of suspicious authority k.
Whatever acquaintance with the remote regions of
the earth the Phenicians or Carthaginians may have
acquired, was concealed from the reft of mankind
with a mercantile jealousy. Every thing relative
to the course of their navigation was nut only a
mystery of trade, but a secret of ltate. Lxtraor-
(linary facts are recorded concerning their solicitude
to prevent other nations from penetrating into what
they iiflied fllould remain undivulged'. Many of
their discoveries seem, accordingly, to have been
scarcely known beyond the precincts of their own
slate. The navigation round Africa, in particular,
is recorded by the Greek and Roman writer;,
rather as a firange amuting tale, which they did not
comprehend, or did not believe, than as a r:il
tranfaftion, which enlarged their knowledge and
influenced their opinions'". As neither the pro-
grefs of the Phenician or Carthaginian discoveries,

to the curiosity and conjectures of antiquaries, his-
tory must reft satisfied with relating the progress of
navigation and discovery among the Greeks and
Romans, which, though less splendid, is better
ascertained. It is evident that the Phenicians, who
inftruEted the Greeks in many other useful sciences
and arts, did not communicate to them that exten-
five knowledge of navigation which they them-
selves poffefied; nor did the Romans imbibe that
commercial spirit and ardour for discovery which
distinguished their rivals the Carthaginians.-
Though Greece be almost encompassed by the lea,
which formed many spacious bays and commodious
harbours, though it be surrounded by a great num-
ber of fertile islands, yet, notwithstanding such a
favourable situation, which seemed to invite that
ingenious people to apply themselves to navigations
it was long before this art attained any degree of
perfection among them. Their early voyages, the
object of which was piracy rather than commerce,
were so inconsiderable, that the expedition of the
Argonauts from the coast of Thessaly to the
Euxine lea, appeared such an amazing effort of
skill and courage, as entitled the conductors of it

to

to be ranked among the demigods, and exalted the B o oK
vessel in which they failed to a place among the
heavenly conRellations. Even at a later period,
when the Greeks engaged in their famous enter-
prize againfl Troy, their knowledge in naval
affairs seems not to have been much improved.
According to the account of Homer, the only poet
to whom history ventures to appeal, and who, by
his scrupulous accuracy in describing the manners
and arts of early ages, merits this diftinc'ion, the
science of navigation, at that time, had hardly ad-
vanced beyond its rudest slate. The Greeks in the
heroic age seem to have been unacquainted with
the use of iron, the molt serviceable of all the
metals, without vhich no considerable progress
was ever made in the mechanical arts. Their
vessels were of inconsiderable burthen, and moltly
wi:hout decks. They had only one malt, which
was erected or taken down at pleasure. They
were Strangers to the use of anchors. All their
operations in failing were clumsy and unskilful.
They turned their observation towards flars, which
were improper for regulating their course, and
their mode of obfcrving them was inaccurate and
fallacious. When they had finishcd a voyage they
drew their paltry barks ashore, as savages do their
canoes, and these remained on dry land until the
season of returning to sea approached. It is not
then in the early or heroic ages of Greece that we
can expeC to obfcrve the science of navigation,

and

0 o OK and the spirit ofdifcovery, making any considerable
a, -. progress. During that period of disorder and ig-

norance, a thousand causes concurred in reitrain-
ing curiosity and enterprize within very narrow
bounds.

BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a

slate of greater civilization and refinement. Go-
vernment, in its most liberal and perfect form,
began to be established in their different commu-
nities; equal laws and regular police were gradu-
ally introduced; the sciences and arts which are
useful or ornamental in life were carried to a high
pitch of improvement, and several of the Grecian
commonwealths applied to commerce with such
ardour and success, that they were confidered, in
the ancient world, as maritime powers of the first
rank. Even then, however, the naval victories of
the Greeks mufl be ascribed rather to the native spirit
of the people, and to that courage which the enjoy,
ment of liberty infpirct, than to any extraordinary
progress in the science of navigation. In the Persian
war, thoft exploits which the genius of the Greek
hiltorians has rendered so famous, were performed
by fleets, conmpofcd chiefly of fnmall vessels without
lccks"; the crews of which ruflhed forward with
impetuous valour, but little art, to board those ot

highly soever it may have been estimated in an-
cient times, was in proportion to this low condition
of their marine. The maritime itates of Greece
hardly carried on any commerce beyond the limits
of the Mediterranean sea. Their chief intercourse
was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted
in the lesser Asia, in Italy and Sicily. They some-
times visited the ports of Egypt, of the fourhern
provinces of Gaul, and of Thrace; or passing through
the Hellespont, they traded with the countries si-
tuated around the Euxine Tea. Amazing instances
occur of their ignorance even of those countries
which lay within the narrow precinfs to which their
navigation was confined. When the Greeks had
afiembled their combined fleet against Xerxes at
Egina, they thought it unadvifable to fail to Samos,
because they believed the distance between that
island and Egina to be as great as the distance be-
tween Egina and the Pillars of Hercules*. They
were either utterly unacquainted with all the parts
of the globe beyond the Mediterranean sea, or what
knowledge they had of them was founded on con-
jeEture, or derived from the information of a few
persons, whom curiosity and the love of science had
prompted to travel by land into the Upper Asia,
or by sea into Egypt, the ancient feats of wildom

a o 0 K and arts. After all that the Greeks learned from
i_-.y'm them, they appear to have been ignorant of the

most important sacs on which an accurate and
scientific knowledge of the globe is founded.

THE expedition of Alexander tie Great into the

east, considerably enlarged the sphere of naviga-
tion and of geographical knowledge among the
Greeks. That extraordinary man, notwithstanding
the violent pafions which incited him, at Come
times, to the wildest aations, and the most extra-
vagant enterprises, possessed talents which fitted
him not only to conquer, but to govern the world.
He was capable of framing those bold and original
schemes of policy, which gave a new form to hu-
man affairs. The revolution in commerce, brought
about by the force of his genius, is hardly inferior
to that revolution in empire occasioned by the
success of his arms. It is probable, that the op-
position and efforts of the republic of Tyre, which
checked him so long in the career of his viaories,
gave Alexander an opportunity of observing die
vast resources of a maritime power, and conveyed
to him some idea of the immense wealth which the
Tyrians derived from their commerce, especially
that with the East Indies. As Coon as he had ac-
complifhed the delfrucion of Tyre, and reduced
Fgypt to fubjedion, he formed the plan of ren-
dcring the empire which he proposed to fetablilh,
the center of commerce as well as the feat of do-

minion.

mninion. With this view he founded a great city, B 0o0 K
which he honoured with his own name, near one y
of the mouths of the river Nile, that, by the Medi-
terranean sea, and the neighbourhood of the Ara-
bian Gulf, it might command the trade both of
the east and wetl P. This situation was chosen with
such discernment, that Alexandria soon became the
chief commercial city in the world. Not only
during the subsistence of the Grecian empire in
Egypt and in the east, but amidst all the successive
revolutions in those countries, from the time of
the Ptolemies to the discovery of the navigation
by the Cape of Good Hope, commerce, particu-
larly that of the East Indies, continued to flow in
the channel which the sagacity and foresight of
Alexander had marked out for it.

His ambition was not satisfied with having

opened to the Greeks a communication with India
by sea; he aspired to the Sovereignty of those re-
gions which furnished the reft of mankind with so
many precious commodities, and conducted his
army thither by land. Enterprising, however, as
he was, he may be said rather to have viewed,
than to have conquered that country. He did
not, in his progress towards the ealf, advance be-
yond the banks of the rivers that fall into the In-
dus, which is now the weflern boundary of the vast

B 0 0 K continent of India. Amidfit the wild exploits
I _-^- which distinguish this part of his history, he pur-

sued measures that mark the superiority of his ge-
nius, as well as the extent of his views. He had
penetrated as far into India as to confirm his opi-
nion of its commercial importance, and to perceive
that immense wealth might be derived from inter-
course with a country, where the arts of elegance
having been more early cultivated, were arrived at
greater perfection than in any other part of the
earth q. Full of this idea, he resolved to examine
the course of navigation from the mouth of the In-
dus to the bottom of the Persian Gulf; and if it
should be found practicable, to establish a regular
communication between them. In order to effect
this, he proposed to remove the cataraEts, with
which, the jealousy of the Persians, and their aver-
sion to correspondence with foreigners, had ob-
Itruaed the entrance into the Euphratesr; to carry
the commodities of the east up that river, and the
Tigris, which unites with it, into the interior parts
of his Asiatic dominions; while, by the way of the
Arabian Gulf, and the river Nile, they might be
conveyed to Alexandria, and distributed to the rer
of the world. Nearchus, an officer of eminent
abilities, was entrusted with the command of the
fleet fitted out for this expedition. He performed

this voyage, which was deemed an enterprise so B 0O K
arduous and important, that Alexander reckoned it
one of the most extraordinary events which diftin?
guifhed his reign. Inconsiderable as it may now
appear, it was, at that time, an untertaking of no
little merit and difficulty. In the prosecution of it,
striking instances occur of the small progress which
the Greeks had made in naval knowledge . Hav-
ing never failed beyond the bounds of the Medi-
terranean, where the ebb and flow of the sea are
hardly perceptible, when they first observed this
phanomenon at the mouth of the Indus, it ap-
peared to them a prodigy, by which the gods tefti-
fled the displeasure of Heaven against their enter-
prise . During their whole course, they seem
never to have loft fight of land, but followed the
bearings of the coast so servilely, that they could
not much avail themselves of those periodical winds
which facilitate navigation in the Indian ocean.
Accordingly, they spent no less than ten " months
in performing this voyage, which, from the mouth
of the Indus to that of the Persian Gulf, does not
exceed twenty degrees. It is probable, that amidst
the violent convulsions and frequent revolutions
in the East, occasioned by the contests among the
successors of Alexander, the navigation to India,
by the course which Nearchus had opened, was
discontinued. The Indian trade carried on at

OftheRo. THE progress which the Romans made in navi-

gation and discovery, was still more inconsiderable
than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Ro-
man people, their military education, and the fpi-
rit of their laws, concurred in estranging them
from commerce and naval affairs. It was the ne-
ceffity of opposing a formidable rival, not the de-
fire of extending trade, which first prompted them
to aim at maritime power. Though they soon
perceived that, in order to acquire the universal
dominion after which they aspired, it was neceflary
to render themselves masters of the Tea, they fill
confidered the naval service as a subordinate fta-
tion, and reserved for it such citizens as were not
of a rank to be admitted into the legions . In the
history of the Roman republic, hardly one event
occurs, that marks attention to navigation any far-
ther than as it was instrumental towards conquest.
When the Roman valour and discipline had filb.
dued all the maritime states known in the ancient
world; when Carthage, Greece, and Egypt had
submitted to their power, the Romans did not im-
bibe the commercial spirit of the conquered na-
tions. Among that people offoldiers, to have ap-

plied to trade would have been deemed a degrada- B 0 K
tion of a Roman citizen. They abandoned the me-
chanical arts, commerce, and navigation, to slaves,
to freedmen, to provincials, and to citizens of the
lowest clai. Even after the subversion of liberty,
when the severity and haughtiness of ancient man-
ners began to abate, commerce did not rife into
high estimation among the Romans. The trade of
Greece, Egypt, and the other conquered coun-
tries, continued to be carried on in its usual chan-
nels, after they were reduced into the form of Ro-
man provinces. As Rome was the capital of the
world, and the feat of government, all the wealth
and valuable productions of the provinces flowed
naturally thither. The Romans, satisfied with this,
seem to have suffered commerce to remain almost
entirely in the hands of the natives of the refpe&ive
countries. The extent, however, of the Roman
power, which reached over the greatest part of the
known world, the vigilant infpe&ion of the Roman
magistrates, and the (pirit of the Roman govern-
ment, no less intelligent than aaive, gave such ad-
ditional security to commerce, as animated it with
new vigour. The union among nations was never
so entire, nor the intercourse so perfec, as within
the bounds of this vast empire. Commerce, un-
der the Roman dominion, was not obftruted by
the jealousy of rival states, interrupted by frequent
hostilities, or limited by partial reftritions. One
fuperintcnding power moved and regulated the in-

c 4 duftry

B 0 0 K duflry of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits of their

L ,' joint efforts.

NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved

under it. As soon as the Romans acquired a taste
for the luxuries of the East, the trade with India
through Egypt was pushed with new vigour, and
carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the
Indian continent, navigators became acquainted
with the periodical course of the winds, which, in
the ocean that separates Africa from India, blow
with little variation during one half of the year from
the east, and during the other half blow with equal
steadiness from the weft. Encouraged by obferv-
ing this, the pilots who failed from Egypt to India
abandoned their ancient flow and dangerous course
along the coast, and as soon as the western monsoon
set in, took their departure from Ocelis, at the
mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and itretched boldly
across the ocean . The uniform direEtion of the
wind supplying the place of the compass, and ren-
dering the guidance of the liars less necessary, con-
duded them to the port of Muiris, on the western
shore of the Indian continent. There they took on
board their cargo, and returning with the eastern
monsoon, finished their voyage to the Arabian Gulf
within the year. This part of India, now known
by the name of the Malabar coast, seems to have
been the utnoft limit of ancient navigation in that

quarter

quarter of the globe. What imperfect knowledge B o o
the ancients had of the immense countries which -
stretch beyond this towards the east, they received
from a few adventurers, who had visited them by
land. Such excursions were neither frequent nor
extensive, and it is probable, that while the Roman
intercourse with India subsisted, no traveller ever
penetrated farther than to the banks of the Ganges .
The fleets from Egypt which traded at Mufiris
were loaded, it is true, with the spices and other
rich commodities of the continent and islands of
the farther India; but these were brought to that
port, which became the staple of the commerce be-
tween the East and Weft, by the Indians themselves,
in canoes hollowed out of one tree *. The Egyp-
tian and Roman merchants, satisfied with acquiring
those commodities in this manner, did not think it
necelfary to explore unknown seas, and venture
upon a dangerous navigation in quest of the coun-
tries which produced them. But though the dif-
coveries of the Romans in India were so limited,
their commerce there was such as will appear con-
fiderable, even to the present age, in which the In-
dian trade has been extended far beyond the prac-
tice or conception of any preceding period. We
are informed by one author of credit", that the
commerce with India drained the Roman empire
every year of more than four hundred thousand

Diroveries THE discovery of this new method of failing to
Of the an-
cients by India, is the most considerable improvement in na-

vigation made during the continuance of the Ro-
man power. But in ancient times, the knowledge
of remote countries was acquired more frequently
by land than by sea d; and the Romans, from their
peculiar disinclination to naval affairs, may be said
to have negleted totally the latter, though a more
easy and expeditious method of discovery. The
progress, however, of their victorious armies
through a considerable portion of Europe, Afla,
and Africa, contributed greatly to extend discovery
by land, and gradually opened the navigation of
new and unknown seas. Previous to the Roman
conquests, the civilized nations of antiquity had
little communication with those countries in Eu-
rope, which now form its most opulent and power-
ful kingdoms. The interior parts of Spain and
Gaul were imperfecly known. Britain, separated
from the reft of the world, had never been visited,
except by its neighbours the Gauls, and by a few
Carthaginian merchants. The name of Germany
had scarcely been heard of. Into all these coun-
tries the arms of the Romans penetrated. They
entirely subdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered

the

the greatest and most fertile part of Britain; they B o o
advanced into Germany, as far as the banks of the _
river Elbe. In Africa, they acquired a confider-
able knowledge of the provinces which stretch
along the Mediterranean sea, from Egypt weft-
ward to the straits of Gades. In Asia, they not only
fubje&ed to their power most of the provinces
which composed the Pruflian and Macedonian
empires, but, after their vi&ories over'Mithridates
and Tigranes, they seem to have made a more ac-
curate survey of the countries contiguous to the
Euxine and Caspian seas, and to have carried on a
more extensive trade than that of the Greeks with
the opulent and commercial nations, then feated
round the Euxine sea.

FROM this fuccinc survey of discovery and na- a,=P

vigation, which I have traced from the earliet graphical
dawn of hiRforical knowledge to the full eftablilh- among the
ment of the Roman dominion, the progress of both cie
appears to have been wonderfully flow. It seems
neither adequate to what we might have expeted
from the a&ivity and enterprise of the human
mind, nor to what might have been performed by
the power of the great empires which fuccellively
governed the world. If we rejet accounts that
are fabulous and obscure; if we adhere fleadily to
the light and information of authentic history,
without substituting in its place the conje&ures
of fancy, or the dreams of etymologits, we must

conclude,

B 00 K conclude, that the knowledge which the

ancientO
t--..- had acquired of the habitable globe was extremely

confined. In Europe, the extensive provinces in
the eastern part of Germany were little known to
them. They were almost totally unacquainted
with the vail countries which are now subject to
the kings of Denmark, Sweden, Pruflia, Poland,
and the Ruffian empire. The more barren re-
gions, that firetch within the arctic circle, were
quite unexplored. In Africa, their researches did
not extend far beyond the provinces which border
on the Mediterranean, and those situated on the
western shore of the Arabian Gulf. In Asia, they
were unacquainted, as I formerly observed, with
all the fertile and opulent countries beyond the
Ganges, which furnish the most valuable commo-
dities that, in modern times, have been the great
object of the European commerce with India; nor
do they seem to have ever penetrated into those
immense regions occupied by the wandering tribes,
which they called by the general name of Sarma-
tians or Scythians, and which are now possesscd by
Tartars of various denominations, and by the
Asiatic subjects of Russia.

A remark- BUT there is one opinion, that universally pre-
able proof vailed among the ancients, which conveys a more

itriking idea of the small progrcfs they had made
in the knowledge of the habitable globe, than can
be derived from any detail of their discoveries.

10 'I'lhcy

They supposed the earth to be divided into five B 0o K
regions, which they diftinguified by the name of
zones. Two of these, which were nearest the
poles, they termed frigid zones, and believed that
the extreme cold which reigned perpetually there,
rendered them uninhabitable. Another, feated
under the line, and extending on either fide to-
wards the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and
imagined it to be so burnt up with unremitting
heat, as to be equally destitute of inhabitants. On
the two other zones, which occupied the remain-
der of the earth, they bestowed the appellation of
temperate, and taught that there, being the only
regions in which life could subsist, were allotted to
man for his habitation. This wild opinion was
not a conceit of the uninformed vulgar, or a fan-
ciful fiction of the poets, but a system adopted by
the most enlightened philosophers, the mos accu-
rate historians and geographers in Greece and
Rome. According to this theory, a vast portion
of the habitable earth was pronounced to be unfit
for sustaining the human species. Those fertile
and populous regions within the torrid zone,
which are now known not only to yield their own
inhabitants the necessaries and comforts of life
with most luxuriant profusion, but to communi-
cate their superfluous stores to the reft of the world,
were supposed to be the mansion of perpetual fte-
rility and deollation. As all the parts of the globe
with which the ancients were acquainted, lay with-

in

B o o K in the northern temperate zone, their opinion that
_t * rthe other temperate zone was filled with inha-

bitants, was founded on reasoning and conjecture,
not on discovery. They even believed that, by
the intolerable heat of the torrid zone, such an in-
superable barrier was placed between the two tem-
perate regions of the earth, as would prevent for
ever any intercourse between their refpecive inha-
bitants. Thus this extravagant theory not only
proves that the ancients were unacquainted with
the true itate of the globe, but it tended to ren-
der their ignorance perpetual, by representing all
attempts towards opening a communication with
the remote regions of the earth, as utterly imprac-
ticable '.

BUT, however imperfect or inaccurate the geo-

graphical knowledge which the Greeks and Ro-
mans had acquired may appear, in refpe&t of the
present improved ifate of that science, their pro-
grefs in discovery will seem considerable, and the
extent to which they carried navigation and com-
merce must be reckoned great, when compared
with the ignorance of early times. As long as the
Roman empire retained such vigour as to preserve
its authority over the conquered nations, and to
keep them united, it was an obje& of public po-
lice, as well as of private curiosity, to examine and

their armies on its frontier; the empire tottered to

Roman Rate, it was impossible that the sciences
should go on improving. The efforts of genius
were, at that period, as languid and feeble as those
of government. From the time of Ptolemy, no
considerable addition seems to have been made to
geographical knowledge, nor did any important
revolution happen in trade, excepting that Con-

trffts of AT length, the clouds which had been so long
thcir con-
qucls on gathering round the Roman empire, burst into a
comnltrcial iatrwouirfc. torm. Barbarous nations rushed in from several

quarters with irresistible impetuosity, and, in the
general wreck, occasioned by the inundation which
overwhelmed Europe, the arts, sciences, inven-
tions, and discoveries of the Romans, perished in
a great measure, and disappeared g. All the various
tribes, which fettled in the different provinces
of the Roman empire, were' uncivilized, ftran-
gers to letters, destitute of arts, unacquainted with
regular government, subordination, or laws. The
manners and inititutions of Tome of them were so
rude, as to be hardly compatible with a state of
social union. Europe, when occupied by fich in-
habitants, may be said to have returned to a second
infancy, and had to begin anew its career in im-
provement, science, and civility. The first effet
of the settlement of those barbarous invaders was
to dissolve the union by which the Roman power
had cemented mankind together. They parcelled
out Europe into many small and independent states,
differing from each other in language and customs.

and even laws were established, which rendered it
disagreeable and dangerous to visit any foreign
country b. Cities, in which alone an cxtenfive
commerce can be carried on, were few, inconfl-
derable, and destitute of those immunities which
produce security or excite enterprise. The fci-
ences, on which geography and navigation are
founded, were little cultivated. The accounts of
ancient improvements and discoveries, contained in
the Greek and Roman authors, were negleced or
misunderstood. The knowledge of remote re-
gions was loft, their situation, their commodities,
and almost their names, were unknown.

_
-i» quest; and commerce continued to flourish there

when it was almost extin& in every other part of
Europe. The citizens of Constantinople did not
confine their trade to the islands of the Archipelago,
or to the adjacent coasts of Asia; they took a
wider range, and following the course which the
ancients had marked out, imported the commo-
dities of the East Indies from Alexandria. When
Egypt was torn from the Roman empire by the
Arabians, the industry of the Greeks discovered a
new channel, by which the productions of India
might be conveyed to Constantinople. They
were carried up the Indus, as far as that great river
is navigable; thence they were transported by land
to the banks of the river Oxus, and proceeded
down its stream to the Caspian sea. There they
entered the Volga, and failing up it, were carried
by land to the Tanais, which conducted them into
the Euxine sea, where vessels from Constantinople
waited their arrival'. This extraordinary and te-
dious mode of conveyance merits attention, n(,
only as a proof of the violent paflion which the
inhabitants of Constantinople had conceived for the
luxuries of the east, and as a specimen of the ardour
and ingenuity with which they carried on com-

AT the fame time, a gleam of light and know- and among

the Atrbi-

ledge broke in upon the eadt. The Arabians hav- an.
ing contrated some relish for the sciences of the
people, whose empire they had contributed to over-
turn, translated the books of several of the Greek
philosophers into their own language. One of the
first was that valuable work of Ptolemy, which I
have already mentioned. The study of geogra-
phy became, of consequence, an early objet of
attention to the Arabians. But that acute and
ingenious people cultivated chiefly the speculative
and scientific parts of geography. In order to
ascertain the figure and dimensions of the terres-
trial globe, they applied the principles of geome-
try, they had recourse to astronomical obferva-

which, Europe, in more enlightened times, has
been proud to adopt and to imitate. At that pe-
riod, however, the fame of the improvements
made by the Arabians did not reach Europe.
The knowledge of their discoveries was reserved
for ages capable of comprehending and of per-
secing them.

gular government, and some reliffi for the func-
tions and comforts of civil life, Europe began to
awake from its torpid and unaftive state. The first
symptoms of revival were discerned in Italy. The
northern tribes, which took pofliefon of this coun-
try, made progress in improvement with greater
rapidity than the people fettled in other parts of
Europe. Various causes, which it is not the obje&
of this work to enumerate or explain, concurred
in restoring liberty and independence to the cities

revived, navigation was attended to and improved.
Constantinople became the chief mart to which
the Italians resorted. There they not only met with
a favourable reception, but obtained such mercan-
tile privileges as enabled them to carry on trade
with great advantage. They were supplied both
with the precious commodities of the east, and
with many curious manufactures, the produc of an-
cient arts and ingenuity which till subsisted among
the Greeks. As the labour and expence of con-

exorbitant price, the industry of the Italians dif- a o o
covered other methods of procuring them in
greater abundance, and at an easier rate. They
sometimes purchased them in Aleppo, Tripoli,.
and other ports on the coast of Syria, to which
they were brought by a route not unknown to the
ancients. They were conveyed from India by Tea,
up the Persian Gulf, and ascending the Euphrates
and Tigris, as far as Bagdat, were carried by land
across the defart of Palmyra, and from thence
to the towns on the Mediterranean. But from the
length of the journey, and the dangers to which
the caravans were exposed, this proved always a
tedious, and often a precarious mode of convey-
ance. At length, the Soldans of Egypt, having
revived the commerce with India in its ancient
channel, by the Arabian Gulf, the Italian mer-
chants, notwithstanding the violent antipathy to
each other with which Chriflians and the followers
of Mahomet were then possessed, repaired to Alex-
andria, and enduring, from the love of gain, the
insolence and exactions of the Mahometans, efta-
blifhed a lucrative trade in that port. From that
period, the commercial spirit of Italy became a&ive
and enterprising. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose from
inconsiderable towns, to be populous and wealthy
cities. Their naval power increased j their vessels
frequented not only all the ports in the Mediter-
ranean, but venturing sometimes beyond the
Streights, visited the maritime towns of Spain,

D 3 France,

B 0o0 K France, the Low Countries, and England; and,
A- -

began to communicate to its various nations some
taste for the valuable produtions of the east, as
well as some ideas of manufacures and arts, which
were then unknown beyond the precin&s of Italy.

Their pro- WHILE the cities of Italy were thus advancing
grcfr fa-
voured by in their career of improvement, an event happen-

t ed, the most extraordinary perhaps in the history

of mankind, which, instead of retarding the com-
mercial progress of the Italians, rendered it more
rapid. The martial spirit of the Europeans, height-
ened and inflamed by religious zeal, prompted
them to attempt the deliverance of the Holy Land
from the dominion of infidels. Vast armies, corn.
posed of all the nations in Europe, marched to.
wards Asia, upon this wild enterprise. The Ge.
noefe, the Pifans, and Venetians furnished the tranf-
ports which carried them thither. They supplied
them with provisions and military flores. Beside
the immense fums which they received on this
account, they obtained commercial privileges and
eftabli(hments, of great consequence in the fettle-
ments which the Crusaders made in Palestine, and
in other provinces of Asia. From those sources,
prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I
have mentioned. This was accompanied with a
proportional increase of power, and, by the end of
the Holy War, Venice, in particular, became a

3 grca(

great maritime slate, poflfefing an extensive corn- m 0 o K
merce, and ample territories'. Italy was not the _-
only country in which the Crusades contributed to
revive and diffuse such a spirit as prepared Europe
for future discoveries. By their expeditions into
Asia, the other European nations became well ac-
quainted with remote regions, which formerly they
knew only by name, or by the reports of igno-
rant and credulous pilgrims. They had an oppor-
tunity of observing the manners, the arts, and the
accommodations of people more polilhed than
themselves. This intercourse between the east
and weft subsisted almost two centuries. The ad-
venturers, who returned from Asia, communicated
to their countrymen the ideas which they had ac-
quired, and the habits of life they had contraced
by visiting more refined nations. The Europeans
began to be sensible of wants with which they
were formerly unacquainted: new desires were ex-
cited; and such a taste for the commodities and
arts of other countries gradually spread among
them, that they not only encouraged the retort of
foreigners to their harbours, but began to perceive
the advantage and necessity of applying to com-
merce themselves ".

; |o the countries in which the Crusaders carried on

their operations, and to travel by land into the
more remote and opulent regions of the east. The
vild fanaticism, which seems at that period to have
mingled in all the schemes of individuals, no less
than in all the counsels of nations, first incited men
to enter upon those long and dangerous peregrina-
tions. They were afterwards undertaken from
profpecs of commercial advantage, or from mo-
tives of mere curiosity. Benjamin, a Jew of Tu-
dela, in the kingdom of Navarre, possessed with a
fuperftltious Veneration for the law of Moses, and
solicitous to visit his countrymen in the east, whom
he hoped to find in such a ltate of power and opu-
lence as might redound to the honour of his fe&,

by land to Constantinople, proceeded through the
countries to the north of the Euxine and Calpian
seas, as far as Chinese Tartary. From thence he
took his route towards the south, and after traverf-
ing various provinces of the farther India, he em-
barked on the Indian ocean, visited several of its
islands, and returned at the end of thirteen years
by the way of Egypt, to Europe, with much in-
formation concerning a large diRtri& of the globe,
altogether unknown at that time to the western
world". The zeal of the head of the Christian

church co-operated with the fuperitiion of Ben- B o o
jamin the Jew, in discovering the interior and re- - A
mote provinces of Asia. All Christendom having 1146.
been alarmed with accounts of the rapid progreis
of the Tartar arms under Zengis Khan, innocent
IV. who entertained most exalted ideas concerning
the plenitude of his own power, and the fubmif-
sion due to his injunctions, sent father John de
Piano Carpini, at the head of a mifion of Francis-
can monks, and father Afcolino, at the head of
another of Dominicans, to enjoin Kayuk Khan,
the grandson of Zengis, who was then at the head
of the Tartar empire, to embrace the Chriftiaqi
faith, and to desist from desolating the earth by his
arms. The haughty descendant of the greatest
conqueror Asia had ever beheld, aftonilhed at this
strange mandate from an Italian priest, whose name
and jurifdition where alike unknown to him, re-
ceived it with the contempt which it merited,
though he dismissed the mendicants who de-
livered it with impunity. But, as they had pene-
trated into the country by different routes, and fol-
lowed for some time the Tartar camps, which
were always in motion, they had opportunity of
visiting a great part of Asia. Carpini, who pro-
ceeded by the way of Poland and Ruflia, travelled
through its northern provinces as far as the extre-
mities of Thibet. Afcolino, who seems to have
landed somewhere in Syria, advanced through its

i^;3. NOT long after, St. Louis of France contributed

farther towards extending the knowledge which
the Europeans had begun to acquire of those dif-
tant regions. Some designing impostor, who took
advantage of the slender acquaintance of Christen-
dom with the fiate and character of the Asiatic
nations, having informed him that a powerful
Chan of the Tartars had embraced the Christian
faith, the monarch listened to the tale with pious
credulity, and instantly resolved to fend ambaffa-
dors to this illustrious convert, with a view of in-
citing him to attack their common enemy the Sa-
racens in one quarter, while he fell upon them in
another. As monks were the only persons in that
age who possesed such a degree of knowledge as
qualified them for a service of this kind, he em-
ployed in it father Andrew, a Jacobine, who was
followed by father'William de Rubruquis, a Fran-
cifcan. With refpe& to the progress of the former,
there is no memorial extant. The journal of the
latter has been published. He was admitted into
the presence of Mangu, the third Khan in fuccef-
sion from Zengis, and made a circuit through
the interior parts of Asia, more extensive than

To those travellers, whom religious zeal sent

forth to vifir Asia, succeeded others who ventured
into remote countries, from the profpet of com-
mercial advantage, or from motives of mere cu-
riofity. The firit and moss eminent of there was
Marco Polo, a Venetian of a noble family. Hav- r6*.
ing engaged early in trade, according to the cuf-
tom of his country, his aspiring mind wilhed for a
sphere of acivity more extensive than was afforded
to it by the established traffic carried on in those
ports of Europe and Asia, which the Venetians
frequented. This prompted him to travel into
unknown countries, in expectation of opening a
commercial intercourse with them, more suited to
the sanguine ideas and hopes of a young adven-
turer.

As his father had already carried some Euro-

pean commodities to the court of the great Chan
of the Tartars, and had disposed of them to advan-
tage, he resorted thither. Under the protection
of Kublay Chan, the most powerful of all the fuc-
ceffors of Zengis, he continued his mercantile pe-
regrinations in Asia upwards of twenty-fix years;
and, during that time, advanced towards the cast,

B o o K far beyond the utmost boundaries to which any
,..,.._ European traveller had ever proceeded. Inflead

of following the course of Carpini and Rubruquis,
along the vast unpeopled plains of Tartary, he
passed through the chief trading cities in the more
cultivated parts of Asia, and penetrated to Cam-
balu, or Peking, the capital of the great kingdom
of Cathay, or China, subject at that time to the fuc-
cefiors of Zengis. He made more than one voy-
age, on the Indian ocean, he traded in many of the
inands, from which Europe had long received (pice.
ries and other commodities, which it held in high
estimation, though unacquainted with the particular
countries to which it was indebted for those pre-
cious productions; and he obtained information
concerning several countries, which he did not visit
in person, particularly the island Zipangri, proba-
bly the fame now known by the name of Japan '.
On his return, he astonished his contemporaries
with his descriptions of vast regions, whose names
had never been heard of in Europe, and with such
pompous accounts of their fertility, their popu-
loufnefs, their opulence, the variety of their ma-
nufactures, and the extent of their trade, as rose
far above the conception of an uninformed age.

his example, visited most of the countries in the B o o K
cast which he had described, and, like him, pub- .....-
lilhed an account of them'. The narrations of
those early travellers abound with many wild inco-
herent tales, concerning giants, enchanters, and
monsters. But they were not, from that circum-
Itance, less acceptable to an ignorant age, which
delighted in what was marvellous. The wonders
which they told, mostly on hearsay, filled the mul-
titude with admiration. The fa&s which they re-
lated from their own observation, attracted the at-
tention of the more discerning. The former, which
may be confidered as the popular traditions and
fables of the countries through which they had
passcd, were gradually disregarded as Europe ad-
vanced in knowledge. The latter, however incre-
dible some of them may have appeared in their
own time, have been confirmed by the obferva-
tions of modern travellers. By means of both,
however, the curiosity of mankind was excited
with refpcet to the remote parts of the earth, their
ideas were enlarged, and they were not only insen-
sibly dilpofcd to attempt new discoveries, but re-
ceived luch information as direed to that particu-
lar courli in which these were afterwards carried on.

tributed

B o o K tributed more than all the efforts and ingenuity of
-. ... preceding ages, to improve and to extend naviga-

tion. That wonderful property of the magnet, by
which it communicates such virtue to a needle or
slender rod of iron, as to point towards the poles
of the earth, was observed. The use which might
be made of this in directing navigation was imme-
diately perceived. That valuable, but now fami-
liar instrument, the mariners compass, was conflrucQ-
ed. When, by means of it, navigators found that,
at all seasons, and in every place, they could dif-
cover the north and south with so much ease and
accuracy, it became no longer necessary to depend
merely on the light of the stars and the obferva-
tion of the sea coast. They gradually abandoned
their ancient timid and lingering courle along the
lhore, ventured boldly into the ocean, and relying
on this new guide, could Reer in the darkef night,
and under the molt cloudy sky, with a security
and precision hitherto unknown. The compass
may be said to have opened to man the dominion
of the sea, and to have put him in full posses-
sion of the earth, by enabling him to visit every
part of it. Flavio Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi,'a
town of considerable trade in the kingdom of Na-
ples, was the author of this great discovery, about
the year one thousand three hundred and two. It
hath been often the fate of those illustrious bene-
faCtors of mankind, who have enriched science
and improved the arts by their inventions, to de-

rive

rive more reputation than benefit from the happy B o o K
efforts of their genius. But the lot of Gioia has *.;
been still more cruel; through the inattention or
ignorance of contemporary historians, he has been
defrauded even of the fame to which he had such a
just title. We receive from them no information with
rcfpe& to his profeflion, his characer, the precise
time when he made this important difc6very, or
the accidents and inquiries which led to it. The
knowledge of this event, though produ&ive of
greater effets than any recorded in the annals of
the human race, is transmitted to us without any
of those circumitances, which can gratify the cu-
riofity that it naturally awakens'. But though the
use of the compass might enable the Italians to
perform the short voyages to which they were ac-
cultomed, with greater security and expedition, its
influence was not so sudden or extensive, as imme-
diately to render navigation adventurous, and to
excite a spirit of discovery. Many causes com-
bined in preventing this beneficial invention from
producing its full effett instantaneously. Men re-
linquifl ancient habits (lowly, and with reluctance.
They are averse to new experiments, and venture
upon them with timidity. The commercial jea-
louly of the Italians, it is probable, laboured to
conceal the happy. dilcovery of their countryman
from other nations. The art of fleering by the

halfa century elapsed from the time of Gioia's dif-
covery, before navigators ventured into any seas
which they had not been accustomed to frequent.

ome ap- THE first appearance of a bolder spirit may be
pearance of
a bolder dated from the voyages of the Spaniards to the
navgation. Canary or Fortunate Islands. By what accident

they were led to the discovery of those small illes,
which lie near five hundred miles from the Spanish
coast, and above a hundred and fifty miles from
the coast of Africa, contemporary writers have not
explained. But, about the middle of the fourteenth
century, the people of all the different kingdoms
into which Spain was then divided, were accuf-
tomed to make piratical excursions thither, in or-
der to plunder the inhabitants, or to carry them offl
as naves. Clement VI. in virtue of the right
claimed by the holy fee, to dispose of all countries
possesscd by infidels, ere&ted those isles into a king-
dom, in the year one thousand three hundred and
fbrty-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la Cerda,
descended from the royal family of Castile. Bt

fert his nominal title, having never visited the Ca-
naries, John de Bcthcncourt, a Norman baron,

stile '. Bethencourt, with the valour and good for- -
tune which diftinguilhed the adventurers of his
country, attempted and affe&ed the conquest, and
the poffeflion of the Canaries remained for some
time in his family, as a fief held of the crown of
Castile. Previous to this expedition of Bethen-
court, his countrymen fettled in Normandy are
said to have visited the coast of Africa, and to have
proceeded far to the south of the Canary islands.
But their voyages thither seem not to have been 136s
undertaken in consequence of any public or regu-
lar plan for extending navigation and attempting
new discoveries. They were either excursions
suggested by that roving piratical spirit, which de-
scended to the Normans from their anceRtors, or
the commercial enterprises of private merchants,
which attraced so little notice, that hardly any me-
morial of them is to be found in contemporary
authors. In a general survey of the progress of
discovery, it is fulficient to have mentioned this
event; and leaving it among those of dubious ex-
iftencc, or of small importance, we may conclude,
that though much additional information concern-
ing the remote regions of the East had been re-
ceived by travellers who visited them by land, na-

ift rcgu- AT length the period arrived, when Providence

lar plan of
dtrcovery, decreed that men were to pars the limits within

which they had been so long confined, and open to
themselves a more ample field wherein to display
their talents, their enterprise, and courage. The
first considerable efforts towards this were not
made by any of the more powerful states of Eu-
rope, or by thole who had applied to navigation
with the greatest afliduity and success. The glory
of leading the way in this new career was reserved

formed hy for Portugal, one of the smallest and least powerful
huese.r" of the European kingdoms. As the attempts of

the Portuguese to acquire the knowledge of those
parts of the globe with which mankind were then
unacquainted, not only improved and extended the
art of navigation, but roused such a spirit of curio-
fity and enterprise, as led to the discovery of the
New World, of which I propose to write the his-
tory, it is neceflhry to take a full view of the rife,
the progress, and success of their various naval ope-
rations. It was in this school that the discoverer
of America was trained; and unlcfs we trace the

\V.. ;IOUS

VARIOUS circumstances prompted the Portu- B 6 6 K

guefe to exert their acivity in this new diretion, '
ahd enabled them to accomplish undertakings ap- Crcum-
parently superior to the natural force of their mo- which led
narchy. The kings of Portugal, having driven
the Moors out of their dominions, had acquired
power, as well as glory, by the success of their
arms against the infidels. By their viaories over
them, they had extended the royal authority be-
yond the narrow limits within which it was ori-
ginally circumscribed in Portugal, as well as in
other feudal kingdoms. They had the command
of the national force, could rouse it to ad with
united vigour, and, after the expulsion of the
Moors, could employ it without dread of inter-
ruption from any domeRfic enemy. By the per-
petual hostilities carried on for several centuries
against the Mahometans, the martial and adven-
turous spirit which diftingui(hed all the European
nations during the middle ages, was improved and
heightened among the Portuguese. A fierce civil
war towards the close of the fourteenth century,
occasioned by a disputed succession, augmented the
military ardour of the nation, and formed or called
forth men of such acive and daring genius, as are
fit for bold undertakings. The situation of the
kingdom, bounded on every fide by the dominions
of a more powerful neighbour, did not afford free
scope to the ativity of the Portuguese by land, as
the strength of their monarchy was no match for

£ 2 that

B OO0 K that of Caltile. But Portugal was a maritime slate,
I - _ in which there were many commodious harbours;

rhe people had begun to make some progress in
the knowledge and practice of navigation; and the
sea was open to them, presenting the only field of
enterprise in which they could distinguish them-
selves.
FirR at- SUCH was the state of Portugal, and such the

disposition of the people, when John I. surnamed
the Bastard, obtained secure possession of the crown
by the peace concluded with Castile, in the year
one thousand four hundred and eleven. He was
a prince of great merit, who, by superior courage
and abilities, had opened his way to a throne,
which of right did not belong to him. He
instantly perceived that it would be impossible
to preserve public order, or domestic tranquillity,
without finding some employment for the reft-
less spirit of his fubjets. With this view he
alTembled a numerous fleet at Lilbon, composed
of all the ships which he could fit out in his own
kingdom, and of many hired from foreigners.
This great armament was destined to attack the
3r41 Moors fettled on the coast of Barbary. While it

was equipping, a few veflels were appointed to fail
along the western 1hore of Africa bounded by the
Atlantic ocean, and to discover the unknown
countries situated there. From this inconsiderable
attempt, we may date the commencement of that

spirit

spirit of discovery, which opened the barriers that B 0O K
had so long fbut out mankind from the knowledge .
of one half of the terreitrial globe.

AT the time when John lent forth there {hips

on this new voyage, the art of navigation was still
very imperfeCt. Though Africa lay so near to
Portugal, and the fertility of the countries already
known on that continent invited men to explore it
more fully, the Portuguese had never ventured to
fail beyond Cape Non. That promontory, as its
name imports, was hitherto confidered as a bound-
ary which could not be passed. But the nations
of Europe had now acquired as much knowledge,
as emboldened them to disregard the prejudices
and to correEt the errors of their ancestors. The
long reign of ignorance, the conflant enemy of
every curious inquiry, and of every new undertak-
ing, was approaching to its period. The light of
science began to dawn. The works of the an-
cient Greeks and Romans began to be read with
admiration and profit. The sciences cultivated
by the Arabians were introduced into Europe by
the Moors fettled in Spain and Portugal, and by
the Jews, who were very numerous in both these
kingdoms. Geometry, astronomy, and geography,
the sciences on which the art of navigation is
founded, became objers of fludious attention.
The memory of the discoveries made by the an-
cients was revived, and the progress of their navi-

£ 3 gation

B O Q K gation and commerce began to be traced. Some

1. y... of the caufcs which have obftruEed the cultivation

of science in Portugal, during this century and the
laR, did not exifl, or did not operate in the fame
manner, in the fifteenth century ; and the Portu-
guefe, at that period, seem to have kept pace with
other nations on this fide of the Alps in literary
pursuits.
ts fucccrs. As the genius of the age favoured the execution

of that new undertaking, to which the peculiar
state of the country invited the Portuguese, it
proved successful. The vessels sent on the disco-
very doubled that formidable Cape, which had
terminated the progress of former navigators, and
proceeded a hundred and sixty miles beyond it,
to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which
stretched a considerable way into the Atlantic, ap-
peared more dreadful than the promontory which
they had passed, the Portuguese commanders durst
not attempt to fail round it, but returned to Lif-
bon, more satisfied with having advanced so far,
than ashamed of having ventured no farther.

dirtorof creased the palfion for discovery, which began to

on

on to new undertakings. In order to render there B oo K
successful, it was necessary that they should be con- ,
duted by a person who possessed abilities capable
of discerning what was attainable, who enjoyed
leisure to form a regular system for prosecuting
discovery, and who was animated with ardour that
would persevere in spite of obstacles and repulses;
Happily for Portugal, she found all those qualities
in Henry Duke of Viseo, the fourth son of king
John by Philippa of Lancaster, sifter of Henry IV.
king of England. That prince, in his early youth,
having accompanied his father in his expedition to
Barbary, distinguished himself by many deeds of
valour. To the martial spirit, which was the cha-
racteriftic of every man of noble birth at that
time, he added all the accomplishments of a more
enlightened and polished age. He cultivated the
arts and sciences, which were then unknown and
despised by persons of his rank. He applied with
peculiar fondness to the study of geography; and
by the inftruEtion of able masters, as.well as by the
accounts of travellers, he early acquired such know-
ledge of the habitable globe, as discovered the
great probability of finding new and opulent coun-
tries, by failing aling the coast of Africa. Such
an object was formed to awaken the enthusiasm
and ardour of a youthful mind, and he efpoulfd
with the utmofi zeal the patronage of a design
which might prove as beneficial, as it appeared to
be fplerdid and honourable. In order that he

E 4 might

B o0 °K might pursue this great scheme without interrup-

vL tion, he retired. from court immediately after his

return from Africa, and fixed his residence at Sa-
gres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the profpet of
the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts continually
towards his favourite projec, and encouraged him
to execute it. In this retreat he was attended by
some of the most learned men in his country, who
aided him in his researches. He applied for in-
formation to the Moors of Barbary, who were ac-
cuflomed to travel by land into the interior pro-
vinces of Africa, in quest of ivory, gold-duft, and
other rich commodities. He consulted the Jews
fettled in Portugal. By promises, rewards, and
marks of refpedt, he allured into his service several
persons, foreigners as well as Portuguese, who were
eminent for their ikill in navigation. In taking
those preparatory steps, the great abilities of the
prince were seconded by his private virtues. His
integrity, his affability, his refpe& for religion, his
zeal for the honour of his country, engaged per-
sons of all ranks to applaud his design, and to fa-
vour the execution of it. His schemes were al-
lowed by the greater part of his countrymen to
proceed neither from ambition nor the desire of
wealth, but to flow from the warm benevolence of
a heart eager to promote the happiness of mankind,
and which justly entitled him to assume a motto for
his device, that described the quality, by which he
wished to- be diftinguilhed, the talent of doing good.

His

His first effort, as is usual at the commence- B o 0o

ment of any new undertaking, was extremely in-.
considerable. He fitted out a tingle Ihip, and Dacoveryos
giving the command of it to John Gonzalez Zarco to;
and Tristan Vaz, two gentlemen of his household,
who voluntarily offered to conduct the enterprise,
he iniftructed them to use their utmost efforts to
double Cape Bojador, and thence to steer towards
the south. They, according to the mode of navi-
gation which still prevailed, held their course
along the shore; and by following that direction,
they must have encountered almost insuperable
difficulties in attempting to pass Cape Bojador.
But fortune came in aid to their want of skill, and
prevented the voyage from being altogether fruit-
less. A sudden squall of wind arose, drove them
out to sea, and when they expected every moment
to perish, landed them on an unknown island,
which from their happy escape they named Porto
Santo. In the infancy of navigation, the discovery
of this small island appeared a matter of such
moment, that they initantly returned to Por-
tugal with the good tidings, and were received by
Henry with the applause and honour due to for-
tunate adventurers. This faint dawn of success
filled a mind ardent in the pursuit of a favourite
object with liclh ianguine hopes as were fufficicnt
incitements to proceed. Next year, Henry sent 14'9.
out three ships under the fame commanders, to
whom he joined Bartholomew PereItrello, in order

to

B 0 0 K to take possession of. the island which they had
avP ~ discovered. When they began to fettle in Porto

Santo, they observed towards the south a fixed
spot in the horizon like a frnall black cloud. By
ofMadclra. degrees, they were led to conjecure that it might

be land, and fleering towards it, they arrived at a
considerable iflind, uninhabited and covered with
wood, which on that account they called Madeira".
As it was Henry's chief objcrt to render his dif-
coveries ufcful to his country, he immediately
equipped a fleet to carry a colony of Portuguese to
1420. these ifands. By his provident care, they were

furnished not only with the feeds, plants, and do-
meftic animals common in Europe; but as he
forelaw that the warmth of the climate and ser-
tility of the foil would prove favourable to the
rearing of other productions, he procured flips of
the vine from the island of Cyprus, the rich wines
of which were then in great request, and plants of
the sugar-cane from Sicily, into which it had been
lately introduced. These throve so prosperously
in this new country, that the benefit of cultivating
them was immediately perceived, and the sugar
and wine of Madeira quickly became articles of
some consequence in the commerce of Portu,
galx.

As

As soon as the advantages derived from this first B o K

settlement to the weft of the European continent -, j
began to be felt, the spirit of discovery appeared
less chimerical, and became more adventurous.
By their voyages to Madeira, the Portuguese were
gradually accustomed to a bolder navigation, and
initead of creeping servilely along the coast, ven-
tured into the open sea. In consequence of taking Double
this course, Gilianez, who commanded one of drP Boja
Prince Henry's ships, doubled Cape Bojador, the
boundary of the Portuguese navigation upwards of
twenty years, and which had hitherto been deemed
unpaffable. This successful voyage, which the 1433.
ignorance of the age placed on a level with the
most famous exploits recorded in history, opened a
new sphere to navigation, as it discovered the vast
continent of Africa, still waihed by the Atlantic
ocean, and itretching towards the south. Part of
this was soon explored; the Portuguese advanced Advance

they discovered the river Senegal, and all the coast

their discoveries, or encouraged to attempt them, they difcQ.
by the light and information which they received vrctldcr.
from the works of the ancient mathematicians and
geographers. But, when they began to enter the
torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among the
ancients, that the heat, which reigned perpetually

there,

B 0 0 K there, was so exceffTve as to render it uninhabt.
,__1 able, deterred them, for some time, from proceed-

ing. Their own observations, when they first
ventured into this unknown and formidable region,
tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity con-
cerning the violent operation of the direc rays of
the fun. As far as the river Senegal, the Portu-
guefe had found the coast of Africa inhabited by
people nearly resembling the Moors of Barbary.
When they advanced to the south of that river,
the human form seemed to put on a new appear-
ance. They beheld men with skins black as
ebony, with ihort curled hair, flat notes, thick
lips, and all the peculiar features which are now
known to distinguish the race of negroes. This
firprifing alteration they naturally attributed to the
influence of heat, and if they should advance
nearer to the line, they began to dread that its
effects would be still more violent, Those dangers
were exaggerated, and many other obje&ions
against attempting farther discoveries were pro-
pocfd by some of the grandees, who, from igno-
rance, from envy, or from that cold timid pru-
dlence which rejects whatever has the air of novelty
or enterprise, had hitherto condemned all prince
Henry's chlienes. They represented, that it was
altogether chimerical to expect any advantage from
countries situated' in that region which the wivldoni
and experience of antiquity had pronounced to be
unfit for the habitation of menj that their forc-

fathers, satisfied with cultivating the territory B o K
which Providence had allotted them, did not waste
the strength of the kingdom by fruitless projects,
in quest of new settlements; that Portugal was
already exhausted by the expence of attempts to
discover lands which either did not exist, or which
nature deflined to remain unknown; and was
drained of men, who might have been employed
in undertakings attended with more certain success,
and producive of greater benefit. But neither their
appeal to the authority of the ancients, nor their
reasonings concerning the interests of Portugal)
made any imprefcion upon the determined phi-
fophic mind of prince Henry. The discoveries
which he had already made convinced him that
the ancients had little more than a conjectural
knowledge of the torrid zone. He was no less
satisfied that the political arguments of his oppo-
nents with refpet to the interest of Portugal were
malevolent and ill founded. In those sentiments
he was strenuously supported by his brother Pedro,
who governed the kingdom as guardian of their
nephew Alphonfo V. who had succeeded to the 1431.
throne during his minority; and infRead of flack-
ening his efforts, Henry continued to pursue his
discoveries with fresh ardour.

BUT, in order to silence all the murmurs of Papal grant

opposition, he endeavoured. to obtain the fantion O' whatlu
of the highest authority in favour of his operations. ',,!,iit

With cor.

n o O K With this view, he applied to the Pope, and re-

presented, in pompous terms, the pious and
unwearied zeal, with which he had exerted himself
during twenty years, in difco*ering unknown
countries, the wretched inhabitants of which were
utter firangers to true religion, wandering in hea-
then darkness, or led affray by the delusions of
Mahomet. He besought the holy father, to whom,
as the vicar of Christ, all the kingdoms of the
earth were fubjest, to confer on the crown of
Portugal a right to all the countries possessed by
Infidels, which flould be discovered by the in-
duffry of its fubjeds, and fubduec by the force of
its arms. He intreated him to enjoin all Christian
powers, under the highest penalties, not to molest
Portugal while engaged in this laudable enterprise,
and to prohibit them from fettling in any of the
countries which the Portuguese should discover.
He promised that, in all their expeditions, it should
be the chief objeat of his countrymen to spread
the knowledge of the Christian religion, to
establish the authority of the holy fee, and to in-
crease the flock of the universal pastor. As it was
by improving with dexterity every favourable con-
junture for acquiring new powers, that the court
of Rome had gradually extended its usurpations,
Eulgcne IV. the Pontiff to whom this application
was made, eagerly seized the opportunity which
now presented itself. Ie initantly perceived, that
by complying with Prince Henry's request, he

might

might exercise a prerogative no less flattering in B 0 K
its own nature, than likely to prove beneficial in . -
its consequences. A bull was accordingly issued,
in which, after applauding in the strongest terms
the past efforts of the Portuguese, and exhorting
them to proceed in that laudable career on which
they had entered, he granted them an exclusive
right to all the countries which they should disco-
ver, from Cape Non to the continent of India.

EXTRAVAGANT as this donation, comprehend-

ing such a large portion of the habitable globe,
would now appear even in Catholic countries, no
person in the fifteenth century doubtedt that the
Pope, in the plenitude of his apoflolic power, had
a right to confer it. Prince Henry v:as soon fen-
fible of the advantages which hc derived from this
transaction. His fchemcs were authorised and
fandified by the bull approving of them. The
ipirit of discovery was conncted with zeal for
religion, which, in that age, was a principle of
such activity and vigour, as to influence the con-
duct of nations. All Christian princes were de-
terred from intruding into those countries which the
Portuguese had discovered, or from interrupting
the progress of their navigation and conquests r.

the sphere of navigation so suddenly enlarged, and

formed theories concerning those unexpected dif-
coveries. The vulgar inquired and wondered;
while enterprising adventurers crowded from every
part of Europe, soliciting Prince Henry to em-
ploy them in this honourable service. Many Ve-
netians and Genoese, in particular, who were, at
that time, superior to all other nations in the
science of naval affairs, entered aboard the Portu-
guefe lhips, and acquired a more perse& and ex-
tensive knowledge of their profeflion in that new
school of navigation. In emulation of these
foreigners, the Portuguese exerted their own
talents. The nation seconded the deligns of the
446. prince. Private merchants formed companies,

with a view to search for unknown countries. The
Cape de Verd islands, which lie off the promontory
of that name, were discovered, and soon after the
isles called Azores. As the former of these are
above three hundred miles from the African coast,
and the latter nine hundred miles from any conti-
nent, it is evident, by their venturing so boldly
into the open seas, that the Portuguese had, by
this time, improved greatly in the art of navigation.

notwithstanding all the advantages which they
derived from these, the Portuguese, during his
life, did not advance, in their utmost progress
towards the south, within five degrees of the equi-
noctial line; and, after their continued exertions
for half a century, hardly fifteen hundred miles of From r14X

acquainted with the efforts of navigation in its
state of maturity and improvement, those leays of
its early years muff necessarily appear feeble and
unskilful. But, inconsiderable as they may be
deemed, they were sufficient to turn the curiosity
of the European nations into a new channel, to
excite an enterprising spirit, and to point the way
to future discoveries.

It ceased to be a national objet, and became the
concern of a private man, more attentive to his
own gain, than to the glory of his country.
Some progress, however, was made. The Por-

to their astonishment, found that region of the

with intolerable heat, to be not only habitable,

with addi- poffeifcd talents capable both of forming and exe-
tional ar-

while prince, had arisen from duties on the trade
with the newly discovered countries, this naturally
turned his attention towards them, and satisfied him
with refipec to their utility and importance. In
proportion as his knowledge of these countries
extended, the polfeflion of them appeared to be
of greater conlcquence. While the Portugucef
proceeded along the coast of Africa, from Cape
Non to the river of Senegal, they found all that
extcnlive tract to be sandy, barren, and thinly
inhabited by a wretched people, profeling the
Mahometan religion, and fubje& to the valt em-

the power and religion of the Mahometans were
unknown. The country was divided into small
independent principalities, the population was con-
fiderable, the foil fertilez, and the Portuguese soon
discovered that it produced ivory, rich gums,
gold, and other valuable commodities. By the
acquisition of there, commerce was enlarged, and
became more adventurous. Men, animated and
rendered acive by the certain profpe&t of gain,
pursued discovery with greater eagerness, than
when they were excited only by curiosity and hope.

Tats spirit derived no small reinforcement of itsprogref,
vigour from the countenance of such a monarch as
John. Declaring himself the patron of every
attempt towards discovery, he promoted it with
all the ardour of his grand-uncle prince Henry,
and with fiuperior power. The effecs of this
were immediately felt. A powerful fleet was fitted 14"4.

Benin and Congo, advanced above fifteen hundred

lirft time, beheld a new heaven, and observed the
fars of another hemisphere. John was not only
lolicitous to discover, but attentive to secure the
poflcflion of those countries, He built forts on

force of arms. A regular and well-digefted system
was bfrmed with rcfpect to this new object of
policy, and by firmly adhering to it, the Portu-
guefi power and commerce in Africa were efta.

received from the natives, added to what they had

profpetes more extensive, and to fuggedt the idea
of schemes more important, than those which
had hitherto allured and occupied them. They

give credit to the accounts of the ancient Pheni-

deemed fabulous, and led them to conceive hopes
that by following the fame route, they might arrive
at the East Indies, and engross that commerce
which has been the source of wealth and power to
every nation possessed of it. The comprehensive
genius of prince Henry, as we may conjetvure
from the words of the pope's bull, had early form-
ed some idea of this navigation. But though his
countrymen, at that period, were incapable of
conceiving the extent of his views and schemes, all
the Portuguese mathematicians and pilots now
concurred in representing them as well-founded
and practicable. The king entered with warmth

the danger to which he was exposed, by a fuccef- i
sion of violent tempests in unknown seas, and by
the frequent mutinies of his crew, nor the cala-

enterprise. In recompence of his labours and
perseverance, he at last descried that lofty pro-
montory which bounds Africa to the south. But
to descry it, was all that he had in his power to
accomplish. The violence of the winds, the
ihattered condition of his ihips, and the turbulent
spirit of his sailors, compelled him to return, after
a voyage of sixteen months, in which he discover-
ed a far greater extent of country than any former
navigator. Diaz had called the promontory which
terminated his voyage Cabo Tormentofo, or the
stormy Cape; but the king, his master, as he now

the art of drawing. To these he applied with such
ardour and predile&ion, on account of their con-
necion with navigation, his favourite object, that
he advanced with rapid proficiency in the tfudy of
1461. them. Thus qualified, he went to sea at the age

of fourteen, and began his career on that element
which conducted him to so much glory. His early
voyages were to those ports in the Mediterranean
which his countrymen the Genoese frequented.
This being a sphere too narrow for his active mind,
1467- he made an excursion to the northern seas, and

visited the coasts of Iceland, to which the Englifl
and other nations had begun to resort on account
of its fiflery. As navigation, in every direction,
was now become enterprising, he proceeded be-
yond that ifand, the Thule of the ancients, and ad-
vanced several degrees within the polar circle.
Having satisfied his curiosity, by a voyage which
tended more to enlarge his knowledge of naval
affairs, than to improve his fortune, he entered
into the fervicc of a famous fea-captain, of his own
name and family. This man commanded a fniall
ftiuadron, fitted out at his own expcnce, and by

with some Venetian caravals, returning richly laden
from the Low Countries, the vessel on board which
he served took fire, together with one of the
enemy's ihips, to which it was fast grappled. In
this dreadful extremity his intrepidity and pretence
of mind did not forsake him. He threw himself
into the sea, laid hold of a floating oar, and by the
support of it, and his dexterity in swimming, he
reached the shore, though above two leagues dif-

ing gained the esteem of a Portuguese lady, whom
he married, fixed his residence in Litbon. This
alliance, initead of detaching him from a lea-faring

A-,< * knowledge, and to excite a desire of extending it

ftil farther. His wife was a daughter of Bartho-
lomew Pereftrello, one of the captains employed
by prince Henry in his early navigations, and who,
under his protection, had discovered and planted the
islands of Porto Santo and Madeira. Columbus got
possession of the journals and charts of this expe-
rienced navigator, and from them lie learned the
course which the Portuguese had held in making
their discoveries, as well as the various circum-
fRances which guided or encouraged them in their
attempts. The study of these toothed and in-
flamed his favourite passion; and while he con-
templated the maps, and read the descriptions of
the new countries which Pereftrello had seen, his
impatience to visit them became irresistible. In
order to indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira,
and continued during 1;:veral years to trade with that
island, with the Canaries, the Azores, the settlements
in Guinea, and all the other places which the Portu-

aimed

aimed at something more. The successful progress B 0O K
of the Portuguese navigators had awakened a spirit I..-e-
of curiosity and emulation, which set every man
of science upon examining all the circumstances that
led to the discoveries which they had made, or that
afforded a profpe& of succeeding in any new and
bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus,
naturally inquisitive, capable of deep refleaion,
and turned to speculations of this kind, was so
often employed in revolving the principles upon
which the Portuguese had founded their schemes
of discovery, and the mode on which they had
carried them on, that he gradually began to form
an idea of improving upon their plan, and of ac-
complilhing discoveries which hitherto they had
attempted in vain.

To find out a paifage by Tea to the East Indies, He tormn

the idea ol

was the great object in view at that period. From a new
the time that the Portuguese doubled Cape de Indsa.
Verd, this was the point at which they aimed in
all their navigations, and, in comparison with it,
all their discoveries in Africa appeared inconfidcr-
able. The fertility and riches of India had been
known for many ages; its spices and other valuable
commodities were in high request throughout Eu-
rope, and the vast wealth of the Venetians arising
from their having engrossed this trade, had raised
the envy of all nations. But how intent soever the
Portuguese were upon dilcovering a new route to

those

B 10 K those desirable regions, they searched for it only by
i- o Afleering towards the south, in hopes of arriving at

India, by turning to the east, after they had failed
round the farther.extremity of Africa. This course
was still unknown, and, even if discovered, was of
such immense length, that a voyage from Europe
to India must have appeared, at that period, an
undertaking, extremely arduous, and of very uncer-
tain issue. More than half a century had been em-
ployed in advancing from Cape Non to the equa-
tor; a much longer space of time might elapse be-
fore the more extensive navigation from that to
India could be accomplished. These reflections
upon the uncertainty, the danger and tediousness
of the course which the Portuguese were pursuing,
naturally led Columbus to confider whether a
shorter and more direct passage to the East Indies
might not be found out. After revolving long and
seriously every circumitance filggefted by his fu-
perior knowledge in the theory as well as practice
of navigation, after comparing attentively the ob-
itrvations of modern pilots with the hints and
conjectures of ancient authors, he at last concluded,
that by failing directly towards the weft, across the
Atlantic ocean, new countries, which probably
formed a part of the great continent of India, muit
iiifllibly be discovered.

adopt this opinion, seemingly as chimerical as it B o°° K
was new and extraordinary. The spherical figure -yJ
of the earth was known, and its magnitude afcer-
tained with some degree of accuracy. From this
it was evident, that the continents of Europe, Asia,
and Africa, as far as they were known at that time,
formed but a small portion of the terraqueous
globe. It was suitable to our ideas concerning the
wifiom and beneficence of the Author of Nature,
to believe that the vast space still unexplored, was
not covered entirely by a waste unprofitable ocean,
but occupied by countries fit for the habitation of
man. It appeared likewise extremely probable,
that the continent, on this fide of the globe, was
balanced by a proportional quantity of land in the
other hemifpliere. These conclusions concerning
the existence of another continent, drawn from the
figure and ftru&ure of the globe, were confirmed
by the observations and conjecures of modern na-
vigators. A Portuguese pilot, having stretched
farther to the weft than was usual at that time,
took up a piece of timber artificially carved, float-
ing upon the sea; and as it was driven towards
him by a westerly wind, he concluded that it came
from some unknown land, situated in that quarter.
Columbus's brother-in-law had found, to the weft
of the Madeira iles, a piece of timber fashioned in
the fame manner, and brought by the fame windj
and had seen likewise canes of an enormous size
floating upon the waves, which resembled those

trees, torn up by the roots, were often driven upon
the coasts of the Azores, and at one time the dead
bodies of two men with singular features, refeim-
bling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of
Africa, were cast ashore there.

As the force of this united evidence, arising

from theoretical principles and practical obferva-
tions, led Columbus to expect the discovery of
new coun:ries in the western ocean, other reasons
induced him to believe that there must be con-
nected with the continent of India. Though the
ancients had hardly ever penetrated into India
farther than the banks of the Ganges, yet some
Greek authors had ventured to describe the pro-
vinces beyond that river. As men are prone, and
at liberty, to magnify what is remote or unknown,
they reprcfcnted them as regions of an immense
extent. Ctelias affirmed that India was as large
as all the reli of Asia. Oneficritus, whom Pliny
the naturalist follows ,. contended that it was equal
to a third part of the habitable earth. Nearchus
.lilerted, that it would take four months to march
in a flraight line from one extremity of India to
th, other'. The journal of Marco Polo, who

had proceeded towards the East far beyond the B O O
limits to which any European had ever advanced, ,.--
seemed to confirm there exaggerated accounts of
the ancients. By his magnificent descriptions of
the kingdoms of Cathay and Cipango, and of many
other countries, the names of which were unknown
in Europe, India appeared to be a region of vast
extent. From these accounts, which, however de-
feEtive, were the most accurate that the people of
Europe had received at that period, with refpe&t
to the remote parts of the East, Columbus drew a
just conclusion. He contended, that, in propor-
tion as the continent of India ifretched out towards
the East, it must, in consequence of the spherical
figure of the earth, approach nearer to the islands
which had lately been discovered to the weft of
Africa; that the distance from the one to the
other was probably not very considerable; and that
the most direct, as well as shortest course to the
remote regions of the east, was to be found by fail-
ing due weft . This notion concerning the vicinity
of India to the western parts of our continent, was
countenanced by some eminent writers among the
ancients, the fancion of whose authority was ne-
ceffary, in that age, to procure a favourable recep-
tion to any tenet. Aristotle thought it probable
that the Columns of Hercules, or Straits of Gibral-
tar, were not far removed from the East Indies, and
that there might be a communication by sea be-

Spain to India, in a few days'. The famous At.
lantic island described by Plato, and supposed by
many to be a real country, beyond which an un-
known continent was situated, is represented by
him as lying at no great distance from Spain. After
weighing all there particulars, Columbus, in whose
character the modesty and diffidence of true genius
was united with the ardent enthusiasm of a pro-
je&tor, did not reft with such absolute afllirance
either upon his own arguments, or upon the au-
thority of the ancients, as not to consult such of his
contemporaries as were capable of comprehending
the nature of the evidence which he produced in
support of his opinion. As early as the year one

municated his ideas concerning the probability of
discovering new countries, by failing westwards, to

knowledge of cofinography, and who, from the
learning as well as candour which he discovers in
his reply, appears to have been well entitled to the
confidence which Columbus placed in him. He
warmly approved of the plan, suggested several fats
in confirmation of it, and encouraged Columbus
to persevere in an undertaking so laudable, and

those reasonings, and observations, and authorities, cution
would have served only as the foundation of some
plausible and fruitless theory, which might have
furnished matter for ingenious discourse, or fanciful
conjecture. But with his sanguine and enterprising
temper, speculation led diretly to ation. Fully
satisfied himself with refpet to the truth of his
system, he was impatient to bring it to the test of
experiment, and to set out upon a voyage of dif-
covery. The first ftep towards this was to secure
the patronage of some of the considerable powers
in Europe, capable of undertaking such an enter-
prise. As long absence had not extinguished the
affe&ion which he bore to his native country, he
wilhed that it should reap the fruits of his labours
and invention. With this view, he laid his scheme Heappiu,
before the Senate of Genoa, and making his totec'
country the first tender of his service, offered to
fail under the banners of the republic, in quest of
the new regions which he expeced to discover.
But Columbus had resided for so many years in
foreign parts, that his countrymen were unac-
quainted with his abilities and charater; and,

jector, and loft for ever the opportunity of re-
Itoring their commonwealth to its ancient fplen-

to the kirg HAVING performed what was due to his coun-
o'ortual; try, Columbus was so little discouraged by the

repulse which he had received, that, instead of
relinquilhing his undertaking, he pursued it with
fresh ardour. He made his next overture to
John II. king of Portugal, in whose dominions he
had been long tftablifhed, and whom he confidered,
on that account, as having the second claim to his
service. Here every circumifance seemed to pro.
mile him a more favourable reception. He ap-
plied to a monarch of an enterprising genius, no
incompetent judge in naval affairs, and proud of
patronising every attempt to discover new coun-
tries. His fubjetds were the moit experienced
navigators in Europe, and the leaf apt to be inti-
midated either by the novelty or boldness of any
maritime expedition. In Portugal, the professional
skill of Columbus, as well as his personal good
qualities, were thoroughly known; and as the

former rendered it probable that his scheme was B 0 O K
not altogether visionary, the latter exempted him . J
from the suspicion of any sinister intention in pro-
posing it. Accordingly, the king listened to him
in the most gracious manner, and referred the
consideration of his plan to Diego Ortiz, bilhop
of Ceuta, and two Jewish physicians, eminent
cosmographers, whom he was accustomed to con-
fult in matters of this kind. As in Genoa, igno-
rance had opposed and disappointed Columbus; in
Lilbon, he had to combat with prejudice, an
enemy no less formidable. The persons, accord-
ing to whose decision his scheme was to be adopted
or rejeted, had been the chief directors of the
Portuguese navigations, and had advised to search
for a passage to India, by steering a course diretly
opposite to that which Columbus recommended as
shorter and more certain. They could not, there-
fore, approve of his proposal, without submitting
to the double mortification, of condemning their
own theory, and of acknowledging his superior
sagacity. After teasing him with captious quef- bywlhomhc
tions, and starting innumerable objetions, with a
view of betraying him into such a particular expla-
nation of his system, as might draw from him a
full discovery of its nature, they deferred pasing a
final judgment with refpe& to it. In the mean
time, they conspired to rob him of the honour and
advantages which he expecled from the success of

on this occasion the sentiments becoming a mo-

But the pilot, chosen to execute Columbus's plan,
had neither the genius, nor the fortitude of its
author. Contrary winds arose, no fight of ap-
proaching land appeared, his courage failed, and
he returned to Lisbon, execrating the projet as

determined to break off all intercourse with a

instantly quitted the kingdom, and landed in Spain

liberty to court the protetion of any patron,
whom he could engage to approve of his plan, and
to carry it into execution, he resolved to propose it

tion of his proposals in the Spanish court. Spain
was, at that juncure, engaged in a dangerous war
with Grenada, the last of the Moorish kingdoms
in that country. The wary and suspicious temper
of Ferdinand was not formed to relish bold or
uncommon designs. Isabella, though tore gene.
rous and enterprising, was under the influence of
her husband in all her a&ions. The Spaniards
had hitherto made no efforts to extend navigation
beyond its ancient limits, and had beheld the
amazing progress of discovery among their neigh-
bours the Portuguese, without one attempt to
imitate or to rival them. The war with the Infi-
dels afforded an ample field to the national activity
and love of glory. Under circumstances so unfa-
vourable, it was impossible for Columbus to make
rapid progress with a nation, naturally flow and
dilatory in forming all its resolutions. His cha-
rater, however, was admirably adapted to that
of the people, whose confidence and protetion he
solicited. He was grave, though courteous in hi&

By qualities so refpe'table, he not only gained
many private friends, but acquired such general

appearance, suitable to the mediocrity of his for-
tune, he was not confidered as a mere adventurer,
to whom indigence had suggested a visionary pro-
je&, but was received as a person to whose propo.

countrymen as were supposed best qualified to
decide with refpecd to a fubje& of this kind. But
true science had, hitherto, made so little progress
in Spain, that the pretended philosophers, fcleded
to judge in a matter of fich moment, did not
comprehend the first principles upon which Co-
hlnlbus founcled his conjcthlres and hopes. Some
of them, from miftakcn notions concerning the
dimensions of the globe, contended that a voyage
to those remote parts of the eafrl, which Columbus
expected to discover, could not be performed in
Icls than three years. Others concluded, that
either he would find the ocean to be of infinite
extent, according to the opinion of some ancient

philofi-

hlilofophers; or, if he should persist in fleering B o o A
towards the weft beyond a certain point, that the _ _
convex figure of the globe would prevent his re-
turn, and that he mult inevitably perifll, in the
vain attempt to open a communication between the
two opposite hemispheres, which nature had for
ever disjoined. Even without deigning to enter
into any particular difcuflion, many rejected the
scheme in general, upon the credit of a maxim,
under which the ignorant and unenterprifingfhelter
themselves in every age, " That it is prefumptu-
ous in any person, to suppose that he alone possesses
knowledge superior to all the reft of mankind
united." They maintained, that if there were
really any such countries as Columbus pretended,
they could not have remained so long concealed,
nor would the wisdom and sagacity of former ages
have left the glory of this invention to an obscure
Gcnoefe pilot.

IT required all Columbus's patience and address who mak

to negociate with men capable of advancing such nbule
strange propositions. He had to contend not only crt-
with the obstinacy of ignorance, but with what is
till more intractable, the pride of false knowledge.
After innumerable conferences, and wafting five
years in fruitless endeavours to inform and to satisfy
judges so little capable of deciding with propriety,
l'alavcra, at last, made such an unfavourable re-
port to Ferdinand and Isabella, as induced them to

acquaint

5 o O K acquaint Columbus, that until the war with the
- l . Moors ihould be brought to a period, it would

be imprudent to engage in any new and extensive
enterprise.

WHATEVER care was taken to soften the harti.

ness of this declaration, Columbus confidered it as
a final rejection of his proposals. But happily for
mankind, that superiority of genius, which is ca.
pable of forming great and uncommon designs,
is usually accompanied with an ardent enthusiasm,
which can neither be cooled by delays, nor damped
by disappointment. Columbus was of this fan-
guine temper. Though he felt deeply the cruel
blow given to his hopes, and retired immediately
from a court, where he had been amused so long
with vain expectations, his confidence in the just-
ness of his own fytem did not diminish, and
his impatience to demonstrate the truth of it by
an atual experiment, became greater than ever.
Having courted the proteEtion of Sovereign fates
without success, he applied, next, to persons of
inferior rank, and addressed fucceflively the dukes
of Medina, Sidonia, and Medina Celi, who,
though fubjets, were poffefled of power and
opulence more than equal to the enterprise which
he projected. His negociations with them proved
as fruitless, as those in which he had been hitherto
engaged; for these noblemen were either as little
convinced by Columbus's arguments as their fupe-

riors,

riors, or they were afraid of alarming the jealousy, B o K
and offending the pride of Ferdinand, by counte- .t /_
nancing a scheme which he had reje&ed *.

AMID the painful sensations occasioned by such Necai-
a fucceflion of disappointments, Columbus had to brother in
sustain the additional distress, of having received zn~Dd
no accounts of his brother, whom he had sent to
the court of England. In his voyage to that coun-
try, Bartholomew had been so unfortunate as to
fall into the hands of pirates, who having stripped
him of every thing, detained him a prisoner for fe-
veral years. At length, he made his escape, and
arrived in London, but in such extreme indigence,
that he was obliged to employ himself, during a
considerable time, in drawing and felling maps,
in order to pick up as much money as would pur-
chafe a decent dress, in which he might venture to
appear at court. He then laid before the king the
proposals, with which he had been entrusted by his
brother, and, notwithstanding Henry's exceflfvc
caution and parsimony, which rendered him averse
to new or expensive undertakings, he received Co-
lumbus's overtures, with more approbation, than
any monarch to whom they had hitherto been pre.
sented.

MEANWHILE, Columbus being unacquainted Colmbun

court

B o OK court of England in person, in hopes of meeting

UI . with a more favourable reception there. He had

already made preparations for this purpose, and
taken measures for the disposal of his children
during his absence, when Juan Perez, the guardian
of the monastery of Rabida, near Palos, in which
they had been educated, earnestly solicited him to
defer his journey for a short time. Perez was a
man of considerable learning, and of some credit
with Queen Isabella, to whom he was known
personally. He was warmly attached to Columbus,
with whose abilities as well as integrity he had
many opportunities of being acquainted. Prompt-
ed by curiosity or by friendship, he entered upon
an accurate examination of his system, in conjunc-
tion with a physician setted in the neighbourhood,
who was a considerable proficient in mathematical
knowledge. This investigation satisfied them so
thoroughly, with refpec to the solidity of the
principles on which Columbus founded his opinion,
and the probability of success in executing the plan
which he proposed, that Perez, in order to pre-
vent his country from being deprived of the glory
and benefit, which must accrue to the patrons of
such a grand enterprise, ventured to write to Ifa-
bella, conjuring ler to confider the matter anew,
with the attention which it merited.

MOVED by the representations of a person whom
she refpcdcd, I akblla desired Percz to repair im-

mediately

mediately to the village of Santa FC, in which, on 3 0 0 K
account of the siege of Granada, the court resided . ~
at that time, that The might confer with him upon this
important fubje&. The first effect of their inter- g491.
view was a gracious invitation of Columbus back
to court, accompanied with the present of a finall
fum to equip him for the journey. As there was
now a certain profpet, that the war with the Moors
would speedily be brought to an happy ifrue by
the reduction of Granada, which would leave the
nation at liberty to engage in new undertakings;
this, as well as the mark of royal favour, with
which Columbus had been lately honoured, en-
couraged his friends to appear with greater con-
fidence than formerly in support of his scheme.
The chief of these, Alonfo de Quintanilla, comp-
troller of the finances in Castile, and Luis de San -
tangel, receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues in
Aragon, whose. meritorious zeal in promoting this
great design entitles their names to an honourable
place in history, introduced Columbus to many
persons of high rank, and interested them warmly
in his behalf.

dinand with favourable fcntiments. He fill re- *'po"'ied
garded Columbus's project as extravagant and chi-
merical; and in order to render the efforts of his
partizans ineffectual, he had the address to employ
in this new negociation with him, fomc of the per-

4 1'ons

B o K sons who had formerly pronounced his scheme to

I^_, be impracticable. To their aftonilhment, Colum-

bus appeared before them with the fame confident
hopes of fuccefl as formerly, and inified upon the
fame high recompence. He propoled that a small
feet ihould be fitted out, under his command, to
attempt the discovery, and demanded to be ap-
pointed hereditary admiral and viceroy of all the
seas and lands which he should discover, and to
have the tenths of the profits arising from them,
fettled irrevocably upon himself a'nd his de-
fcendants. At the fame time, he offered to ad-
vance the eighth part of the fum necessary forac-
complifhing his design, on condition that he should
be entitled to a proportional share of benefit from
the adventure. If the enterprise Ihould totally
miscarry, he made no flipulation for any reward or
emolument whatever. Instead of viewing this con-
duc as the clearefd evidence of his full persuasion
with refpe& to the truth of his own system, or being
struck with that magnanimity which, after To many
delays and repulses, would stoop to nothing inferior
to its original claims, the persons with whom Co-
lumbus treated, began meanly to calculate the ex-
pence of the expedition, and the value of the re-
ward which he demanded. The expence, moderate
as it was, they represented to be too great for
Spain, in the present exhaufled tlate of its finances.
They contended, that the honours and emolu-
ments claimed by Columbus, were exorbitant, even

9 if

if he should perform the utmost of what he had B 0 O K
promised; and if all his sanguine hopes should prove
illusive, such vast conceflions to an adventurer
would be deemed not only inconsiderate, but ridi-
culous. In this imposing garb of caution and pru-
dence) their opinion appeared so plausible, and was
so warmly flipported by Ferdinand, that Isabella
declined giving any countenance to Columbus, and
abruptly broke off the negociation with him which
ihe had begun.

THrs was more mortifying to Columbus than
all the disappointments which he had hitherto met
with. The invitation to court from Isabella, like
an unexpeced ray of light, had opened such pro-
Ipe&s of success, as encouraged him to hope that
his labours were at an end; but now darkness and
uncertainty returned, and his mind, firm as it was,
could hardly support the Ihock of such an unfore-
seen reverse. He withdrew in deep anguish from
court, with an intention of profccuting his voyage
to England, as his last resource.

*4'9' the vigilant and discerning patrons of Columbus,

took advantage of this favourable situation, in or-
der to make one effort more in behalf of their
friend. They addressed themselves to Isabella, and
after exprefling some surprise, that she, who had
always been the munificent patroness of generous
undertakings, should hesitate so long to counte-
nance the most splendid scheme that had ever been
proposed to any monarch; they represented to her,
that Columbus was a man of a found understanding
and virtuous character, well qualified, by his ex-
perience in navigation, as well as his knowledge
of geometry, to form just ideas with refpe& to the
structure of the globe and the situation of its va-
rious regions; that, by offering to risk his own life
and fortune in the execution of his scheme, he gave
the most satisfying evidence both of his integrity
and hope of success; that the fum requisite for
equipping such an armament as he demanded was
inconsiderable, and the advantages which might
accrue from his undertaking were immense; that
he demanded no recompence for his invention and
labour, but what was to arise from the countries
which he should discover; that, as it was worthy
of her magnanimity to make this noble attempt to
extend the sphere of human knowledge, and to
open an intercourse with regions hitherto unknown,
so it would afford the highest fatisfaCion to her

faith in those provinces of Spain from which it had _ _
been long banished, to discover a new world, to '49'
which Ihe might communicate the light and blef-
sings of divine truth; that if now she did not
decide inflantly, the opportunity would be irre-
trievably loftl that Columbus was on his way to
foreign countries, where some prince, more for-
tunate or adventurous, would close with his pro-
pofals, and Spain would for ever bewail the fatal
timidity which had excluded her from the glory
and advantages that ihe had once in her power to
have enjoyed.

THESE forcible arguments, urged by persons of
such authority, and at a juncture so well chosen,
produced the dcfired effect. They dispelled all
Isabella's doubts and fears; she ordered Columbus
to be instantly recalled, declared her resolution of
employing him on his own terms, and regretting
the low estate of her finances, generouly offered to
pledge her own jewels, in order to raise as much
money as might be needed in making preparations
for the voyage. Santangel, in a transport of gra-
titude, kissed the queen's hand, and in order to
save her from having recourse to such a mortify-
ing expedient for procuring money, engaged to ad-
vance immediately the fum that was requisite °.

diffidence frill mingled itflf with his joy. But the
cordial reception which he met with from Isabella,
together with the near profpet of setting out upon
that voyage which had so long been the objet of
his thoughts and wishes, soon effaced the remem-
brance of all that he had suffered in Spain, during
eight tedious years of solicitation and furpenfe.
The negociation now went forward with facility
and dilpatch, and a treaty or capitulation with
Columbus was signed on the seventeenth of April,
one thousand four hundred and ninety-two. The
chief articles of it were, x. Ferdinand and Isabella,
as sovereigns of the ocean, conflituted Columbus
their high admiral in all the seas, islands, and con-
tinents which ihould be discovered by his indtftry;
and stipulated that he and his heirs for ever should
enjoy this office, with the fame powers and prero-
gatives which belonged to the high admiral of
Caltile, within the limits of his jurisdiction. 2. They
appointed Columbus their viceroy in all the islands
and continents which he ihould discover; but if,
fbr the better administration of affairs, it should
hereafter be necessary to establish a separate go-
vernor in any of those countries, they autlorilid
Columbus to name three persons, of whom they

would

would choose one for that office; and the dignity B 0 o Ic
of viceroy, with all its immunities, was likewise to v
be hereditary in the family of Columbus. 3. They '491.
granted to Columbus and his heirs for ever, the
tenth of the free profits accruing from the pro-
dutions and commerce of the countries which he
should discover. 4. They declared, that if any
controverty or law-suit ihall arise with rcfpec to
any mercantile tranfa&ion in the countries which
should be discovered, it ihould be determined lby
the sole authority of Columbus, or of judges to be
appointed by him. 5. They permitted Columbus to
advance one-eighth part of what should be expended
in preparing for the expedition, and in carrying on
commerce with the countries which he should dif-
cover, and intitled him, in return, to an eighth part
of the profit P,

THOUGH the name of Ferdinand appears con-

joined with that of Isabella in this tranfaAion, his
distrust of Columbus was still so violent that he
refused to take any part in the enterprise as king
of Aragon. As the whole expence of the expe-
dition was to be defiayed by the crown of Catlile,
Isabella refcrved for her subje&s of that kingdom
an exclusive right to all the benefits which might
redound from its fucccfs,

i- 3 rations

B o O K rations for the voyage endeavoured to make some

ev reparation to Columbus for the time which he had
'495* loft in fruitless solicitation. By the twelfth of May,

all that depended upon her was adjusted; and Co-
lumbus waited on the king and queen, in order
to receive their final inftrudions. Every thing re-
ipe&ing the destination and conduct of the voyage,
they committed implicitly to the disposal of his pru-
dence. But that they might avoid giving any juit
cause of offenee to the king of Portugal, they
firictly enjoined him not to approach near to the
Portuguese settlements on the coast of Guinea, or
in any of the other countries to which the Portu-
guefe claimed right as discoverers. Isabella had
ordered the ships, of which Columbus was to take
the command, to be fitted out in the port of Palos,
a small maritime town in the province of Anda-
lufia. As the guardian Juan Perez, to whom Co-
lumbus had already been so much indebted, resided
in the neighbourhood of this place, he, by the in-
fluence of that good ecclesiastic, as well as by his
own connection with the inhabitants, not only raised
among them what he wanted of the fum that he
was bound by treaty to advance, but engaged fe-
veral of them to accompany him in the voyage.
The chief of these associates were three brothers
of the name of Pinzon, of considerable wealth, and
of great experience in naval affairs, who were
willing to hazard their lives and fortunes in the
expedition.

BUT,

BUT, after all the efforts of Isabella and Co- B o o K

11.

lumbus, the armament was not suitable, either to v_-
the dignity of the nation by which it was equipped, 1*49'
or to the importance of the service for which it was
destined. It consisted of three vessels. The largelt,
a Ship of no considerable burden, was commanded
by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name
of Santa Maria, out of refpet for the Blessed Vir-
gin, whom he honoured with singular devotion.
Of the second, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon
was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The
third, named the Nigna, was under the command
of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. These two were light
vessels, hardly superior in burden or force to large
boats. This squadron, if it merits that name, was
vi&ualled for twelve months, and had on board
ninety men, motily sailors, together with a few
adventurers who followed the fortune of Columbus,
and some gentlemen of Isabella's court, whom (he
appointed to accompany him. Though the ex-
pence of the undertaking was one of the circ!nl-
stances which chiefly alarmed the court of Sp.in,
and retarded so long the negociatlon with Co-
lumbus, the fum employed in fitting out this fqua-
dron did not exceed four thousand pounds.

As the art of ship-building in the fifteenth cen-

tury was extremely rude, and the bulk of vefils
was accommodated to the flort and easy voyuges

H 4 along

Bo o K along the coast which they were accustomed to

perform, it is a proof of the courage as well as en-
349». terprifing genius of Columbus, that he ventured,

with a fleet so unfit for a distant navigation, to ex-
plore unknown seas, where he had no chart tq
guide him, no knowledge of the tides and currents,
and no experience of the dangers to which he
might be exposed. His eagerness to accomplish
the great design which had b1 long engrossed his
thoughts, made him overlook or difiegard every
circumstance that would have intimidated a mind
kss adventurous. He pushed forward the prepa-
rations with such ardour, and was seconded so es-
fec&ually by the persons to whom Isabella committed
the superintendence of this business, that every
thing was soon in readiness for the voyage. But
as Columbus was deeply impressed with sentiments
of religion, he would not set out upon an expedi-
tion so arduous, and of which one great object was
to extend the knowledge of the Christian faith,
without imploring publicly the guidance and pro-
tetion of Heaven. With this view, he, together
with all the persons under his command, marched
in solemn procellion to the monastery of Rabida.
After conffliing their fins, and obtaining ablolution,
they received the holy ficrament from the hands
of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs
for the success of an enterprise which he had so
zcalouny patronized.

NEXT morning, being Friday the third day of B 0o o

ninety-two, Columbus set fail, a little before fun- Hi9ar.

sent up their supplications to Heaven for the pro-
fperous issue of the voyage, which they wished ra-
ther than expected. Columbus fleered directly for Augul i3,
the Canary Islands, and arrived there without any
occurrence that would have deserved notice on any
other occasion. But, in a voyage of such expecta-
tion and importance, every circumitance was the
objet of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke
loose, the day after she left the harbour, and that
accident alarmed the crew, no less fuperflitious thai
urhfkilful, as a certain omen of the unfortunate
destiny of the expedition. Even in the short run
to the Canaries, the Ihips were found to be To crazy
and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a na-
vigation which was expected to be both long and
dangerous. Columbus refitted them, however, to
the best of his power, and having supplied himself
with frelh provisions, he took his departure from
Gomera, one of the most westerly of the Canary
illands, on the sixth day of September.

HERE the voyage of discovery may properly be The courf

gation, and firetched into unfrequented and'un.

B o o K he made but little way; but on the second, he loft

fight of the Canaries; and many of the tailors, de-
1492- je&ed already and dismayed, when they contem-

plated the boldness of the undertaking, began to
beat their breasts, and to shed tears, as if they were
never more to behold land. Columbus comforted
them with assurances of success, and the profpec
of vast wealth, in those opulent regions whither he
was conducing them. This early discovery of the
spirit of his followers taught Columbus, that he
must prepare to firuggle, not only with the un-
avoidable difficulties which might be expe&ed
from the nature of his undertaking, but with such
as were likely to arise from the ignorance and ti-
midity of the people under his command; and he
perceived that the art of governing the minds of
men would be no less requisite for accomplishing
the discoveries which he had in view, than naval
flill and undaunted courage. Happily for himself;
and for the country by which he was employed,
he joined to the ardent temper and inventive genius
of a projector, virtues of another species, which are
rarely united with them. He possessld a thorough
knowledge of mankind, an insinuating address, a
patient perseverance in executing any plan, the
perfect government of his own passions, and the
talent of acquiring an afccndant over those of other
men. All these qualities, which fornmed him for
command, were accompanied with that superior
knowledge of his profeflion, which begets conti-

dence

dence in times of difficulty and danger. To un- B 0o K
skilful Spanish sailors, accustomed only to coasting a
voyages in the Mediterranean, the maritime science vigi9ancw
of Columbus, the fruit of thirty years experience, and ..
improved by an acquaintance with all the inventions lumbu».
of the Portuguese, appeared immense. As loon
as they put to sea, he regulated every thing by his
sole authority; he superintended the execution of
every order; and allowing himself only a few
hours for sleep, he was at all other times upon
deck. As his course lay through seas which had
not formerly been visited, the founding-line, or
infiruments for observation, were continually in
his hands. After the example of the Portuguese
discoverers, he attended to the motion of tides
and currents, watched the flight of birds, the ap-
pearance of fishes, of sea-weeds, and of every
thing that floated on the waves, and entered every
occurrence, with a minute exa&nefs, in the jour-
nal which he kept. As the length of the voyage
could not fail of alarming sailors habituated only
to Ihort excursions, Columbus' endeavoured to
conceal from them the real progress which they
made. With this view, though they run eighteen
leagues on the second day after they left Gomera,
he gave out that they had advanced only fifteen,
and he uniformly employed the fame artifice of
reckoning Ihort during the whole voyage. By the
fourteenth of September, the fleet was above two
hundred leagues to the weft of the Canary Isles,

at

B 0 0 K at a greater distance from land than any Spaniard
~,_^ had been before that time. There they were struck

flo.. and They observed that the magnetic needle, in their
al ,ins of
h.. crew. compaffcs, did not point exacly to the polar star, but

varied towards the weft; and as they proceeded,
this variation increased. This appearance, which
is now familiar, though it still remains one of the
mnyflcries of nature, into the cause of which the
lagacity of man hath not been able to penetrate,
tilled the companions of Columbus with terror.
They were now in a boundless and unknown ocean,
far from the usual course of navigation; nature
itself seered to be altered, and the only guide
which they had left was about to fail them. Co-
lunimbs, with no less quickness than ingenuity,
invented a reason for this appearance, which,
though it did not satisfy himself, seemed so plat-
fible to them, that it dispelled their fears, or
silenced their murmurs.

HIE still continued to fleer due welt, nearly in

the fame latitude with the Canary islands. In this
course he came within the sphere of the trade wind,
which blows invariably from east to welt, between
the tropics and a few degrees beyond' them. He
advanced before this steady gale with fiuch uniform
rapidity, that it was seldom necefary to shift a fail.
When about four hundred leagues to the weft of
the Canaries, he found the sea fb covered with

3 weC(ds,

teeds, that it resembled a meadow of vast extent, a o o K
and in some places they were so thick, as to retard -_
the motion of the vessels. This strange appear- ',9s-
ance occasioned new alarm and difquietc The
sailors imagined that they were now arrived at the
utmost boundary of the navigable ocean; that
these floating weeds would.obftruct their farther
progress, and concealed dangerous rocks, or fume
large tra& of land, which had funk, they knew
not how, in that place. Columbus endeavoured to
persuade them, that what had alarmed, ought ra-
ther to have encouraged them, and was to be con-
fidered as a sign of approaching land. At the
fame time, a brisk gale arose, and carried them
forward. Several birds were seen hovering about
the fhipP, and directed their flight towards the
weft. The desponding crew resumed some degree
of spirit, and began to entertain frelh hopes.

UPON the first of October they were, according Tiher in.

to the admiral's reckoning, seven hundred and ""''
seventy leagues to the weft of the Canaries; but
left his men should be intimidated by the prodi-
gious length of the navigation, he gave out that
they had proceeded only five hundred and eighty-

BOO K the deceit. They had now been above three

- - O weeks at sea; they had proceeded far beyond what

49-' former navigators had attempted or deemed poffi-

ble; all their prognostics of discovery, drawn from
the flight of birds and other circumstances, had
proved fallacious; the appearances of land, with
which their own credulity or the artifice of their
commander had from time to time flattered and
amused them, had been altogether illusive, and
their profped of success seemed now to be as dif-
tant as ever. These reflections occurred often to
men, who had no other obje& or occupation than
to reason and discourse concerning the intention
and circumstances of their expedition. They made
imprelfion, at first, upon the ignorant and timid,
and extending, by degrees, to such as were better
informed or more resolute, the contagion spread at
length from Ihip to ship. From secret whispers
or murnurings, they proceeded to open cabals and
public complaints. They taxed their sovereign
with inconsiderate credulity, in paying such regard
to the vain promises and rash conjectures of an in-
digent foreigner, as to hazard the lives of so many
of her own subjects, in prosecuting a chimerical
scheme. They affirmed that they had fully per-
formed their duty, by venturing so far in an un-
known and hopeless course, and could incur no
blame, for refuting to follow, any longer, a def-
perate adventurer to certain deftruftion. They
contended, that it was necessary to think of return-

ing

ing to Spain, while their crazy vessels were still in B 0 o o
a condition to keep the sea, but expressed their
fears that the attempt would prove vain, as the "49
wind, which had hitherto been To favourable to
their course, must render it impoflible to fail in
the opposite diretion. All agreed that Columbus
should be compelled by force to adopt a measure
on which their common safety depended. Some
of the more audacious proposed, as the most ex-
peditious and certain method for getting rid at once
of his remonstrances, to throw him into the sea,
being persuaded that, upon their return to Spain,
the death of an unsuccessful projector would excite
little concern, and be enquired into with no curio-
fity.

COLUMBUS was fully sensible of his perilous Theaddrers

of Colum-

situation. He had observed, with great uneasiness, burn
the fatal operation of ignorance and of fear in ft"m.
producing difaffcdlion among his crew, and saw
that it was now ready to burst out into open mu-
tiny. He retained, however, perfect presence of
mind. He asseted to seem ignorant of their ma-
chinations. Notwithstanding the agitation and so-
licitude of his own mind, he appeared with a
cheerful countenance, like a man satisfied with the
progress he had made, and confident of success.
Sometimes he employed all the arts of insinuation,
to soothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to
work upon their ambition or avarice, by magnifi-

- -j were about to acquire. On other occasions, he
492. 8afLumed a tone of authority, and threatened them

with vengeance from their sovereign, if, by their
dastardly behaviour, they should defeat this noble
effort to promote the glory of God, and to exalt
the Spanilh name above that of every other nation.
Even with seditious sailors, the words of a man
whom they had been accustomed to reverence,
were weighty and persuasive, and not only restrain-
ed them from those violent excesses, which they
meditated, but prevailed with them to accompany
their admiral for some time longer.

As they proceeded, the indications of approach-

-ing land seemed to be more certain, and excited
hope in proportion. The birds began to appear
in flocks, making towards the south-west. Co-
lumbus, in imitation of the Portuguese navigators,
who had been guided, in several of their difcovc-
ries, by the motion of birds, altered his courie
from due welf towards that quarter whither they
pointed their fight. But, after holding on for
teveral days in this new direction, without any
better success than formerly, having seen no objett,

bled tumultuonfly on the deck, expoftulated with

ceived that it would be of no avail to have recourse
to any of his former arts, which having been tried
so often, had loll their effe&; and that it was im-
poflible to rekindle any zeal for the success of the
expedition among men, in whose breasts fear had
extinguished every generous sentiment. He fiw Diflrefsof
that it was no less vain to think of employing either
gentle or severe measures, to quell a mutiny so
general and so violent. It was necelary, on all
there accounts, to soothe pafllons which he could
no longer command, and to give way to a torrent
too impetuous to be checked. He promised so-
lemnly to his men that he would comply with their
request, provided they would accompany him, and
obey his commands for three days longer, and if,
during that time, land were not discovered, he
would then abandon the enterprise, and direE his
course towards Spain. .

B 0 o K this propofltion did not appear to them unreason-

'-_ - able. Nor did Columbus hazard much in confining
1492. hinfelf to a term so short. The presages of

discovering land were now so numerous and pro-
mifing, that he deemed them infallible. For some
days the founding line reached the bottom, and the
foil which it brought up indicated land to be at no
great distance. The flocks of birds increased, and
were composed not only of sea fowl, but of such
land birds as could not be supposed to fly far from
the Ihore. The crew of the Pinta observed a cane
floating, which seemed to have been newly cut,
and likewise a piece of timber artificially carved.
The sailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch
of a tree with red berries, perfectly frelh. The
clouds around the setting fun assumed a new ap-
pearance; the air was more mild and warm, and,
during night, the wind became unequal and varia-
ble. From all thele lymnptoms, Columbus was
so confident of being near land, that on the even-
ing of the eleventh of October, after public
prayers for filccefs, he ordered the fails to be
furled, and the ships to lie to, keeping strict
watch, left they should be driven ashore in the
night. During this interval of fufipenfe and ex-
pectation, no man shut his eyes, all kept upon
deck, gazing intently towards that quarter where
they expected to discover the land, which had
been so long the object of their wishes.

ABoUT

ABOUT two hours before midnight, Columbus B 0o0 K

flanding on the forecastle, observed a light at a '
distance, and privately p'; .. i. out to Pedro Land49,i.
Guttierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Gut- covered
tierez perceived it, and calling to Salcedo, comp-
troller of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as
if it were carried from place to place. A little
after midnight the joyful found of land, land, was
heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of
the other ships. But, having been so often de-
ceived by fallacious appearances, every man was
now become flow of belief, and waited, in all the
anguilh of uncertainty and impatience, for the
return of day. As soon as morning dawned, all Fiiday,
doubts and fears were dispelled. From every ship
an island was seen about two leagues to the north,
whose flat and verdant fields, well frored with
wood, and watered with many rivulets, presented
the aspet of a delightful country. The crew of
the Pinta instantly began the Te Deum, as a hymn
of thanksgiving to God, and were joined by those
of the other ships, with tears of joy and transports
of congratulation. This office of gratitude to
Heaven was followed by an a& of justice to their
commander. They threw themselves at the feet
of Columbus, with feelings of felf-condemna-
tion mingled with reverence. They implored him
to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and info-
lence, which had created him so much unnecessary

lately reviled and threatened, to be a person inspired
by Heaven with sagacity and fortitude more than
human, in order to accomplish a design so far
beyond the ideas and conception of all former
ages.

;rs inter- As soon as the fun arose, all their boats were
,i wnath manned and armed. They rowed towards the

ifand with their colours displayed, with warlike
music, and other martial pomp. As they ap-
proached the coast, they saw it covered with a
multitude of people, whom the novelty of the
fpe6lacle had drawn together, whose attitudes and
geltures expressed wonder and astonishment at the
Itrange objects which presented themselves to their
view. Columbus was the first European who set
foot in the New World which he had discovered.
He landed in a rich drcfs, and with a naked sword
in his hand. His men followed, and kneeling
down, they all kilned the ground which they had
so long desired to fee. They next ereted a cru-
cifix, and proflrating tl, nmlcflves before it, returned
thanks to God for conducting their voyage to flch
an happy ilrue. They then took solemn polltf-
lion of the country for the crown of Castile and

were accustomed to observe in acts of this kind, * ,-

THE Spaniards, while thus employed, were Theirmu-

surrounded by many of the natives, who gazed, in ni, to.
silent admiration, upon actions which they could
not comprehend, and of which they did not fore-
fee the consequences. The dress of the Spaniards,
the whiteness of their skins, their beards, their
arms, appeared itrange and surprising. The vait
machines in which they had traverscd the ocean,
that seemed to move upon the waters with wings)
and uttered a dreadful found resembling thunder,
accompanied with lightning and smoke, firuck
them with such terror, that they began to refpe&
their new guests as a superior order of beings, and
concluded that they were children of the Sun, who
had descended to visit the earth.

THE Europeans were hardly less amazed at the

scene now before them. Every herb, and Ihrub,
and tree, was different from those which flourishcd
in Europe. The foil seemed to be rich, but bore
few marks of cultivation. The climate, even to
the Spaniards, felt warm, though extremely de-
lightful. The inhabitants appeared in the simple

COLUMBUS, who now assumed the title and Columbus

authority of admiral and viceroy, called the island ttle of ad.
which he had dilcovered San Salvadcr. It is ,i'io.nd
better known by the name of Guanatani, which
tie natives gave to it, and is one of that large
culter of illands called the Lucaya or Bahama ides.
It is situated above three thousand miles to the wellt
of Goimera, from which the squadron took its de-
1)arture, and only four degrees to the Ibuth of it;

determined to direc his course, in fill confidence
of finding there thole opulent regions which had
been the object of his voyage, and would be a re-
compence for all his toils and dangers. He took
along with him seven of the natives of San Salva-
dor, that, by acquiring the Spanish language, they
might serve as guides and interpreters; and tlhoe
innocent people confidered it as a mark of dif-
tin6ion when they were fclc'ed to accompany

those which he had already visited, but so diverfi-
fled with rising grounds, hills, rivers, woods, and

he resolved to careen his ihips in that place, he
sent some Spaniards, together with one of the
people of San Salvador, to view the interior part
of the country. They, having advanced above
sixty miles from the shore, reported, upon their
return, that the foil was richer and more cultivated
than any they had hitherto discovered; that, be-
fides many scattered cottages, they had found one
village, containing above a thousand inhabitants;
that the people, though naked, seemed to be more
intelligent than those of San Salvador, but had
treated them with the fame refpecful attention,
killing their feet, and honouring them as sacred
beings allied to Heaven; that they had given them
to eat a certain root, the taste of which resembled
roafied chefnuts, and likewise a singular species of
corn called maize, which, either when roasted
whole or ground into meal, was abundantly pala-
table ; that there seemed to be no four-footed ani-
mals in the country, but a species of dogs, which
could not bark, and a creature resembling a rabbit,
but of a much smaller size ; that they had obfcrved
some ornaments of gold among the people, but of
no great value .

THESE

B O K THESE messengers had prevailed with some of

c-, the natives to accompany them, who informed Co-
s49Z:c- lumbus, that the gold of which they made their
,rTis ithi ornaments was found in Clbanacan. By this word

they meant the middle or inland part of Cuba;
but Columbus, being ignorant of their language,
as well as unaccustomed to their pronunciation,
and his thoughts running continually upon his own
theory concerning the discovery of the East Indies,
he was led, by the relemblance of iound, to ful,-
pose that they fpioke of the Great Khan, and ima-
gined that the opulent kingdom of Cathay, de-
lcribcd by Marco Polo,, was not very remote.
This induced him to employ some time in viewing
the country. Hie visited almost every harbour,
from Porto del Principe, on the north coast of
Cuba, to the eafiern extremity of the ifand: but,
though delighted with the beauty of the scenes
which every where presented themselves, and
amazed at the luxuriant fertility of the foil, both
which, from their novelty, made a more lively
impression upon his imagination x, he did not find
gold in such quantity as was sufficient to satisfy
either the avarice of his followers, or the ex-
pe&tations of the court to which he was to re-
turn. The people of the country, as much alto-
nifhed at his eagerness in quest of gold, as the
Europeans were at their ignorance and simplicity,

pointed

pointed towards the ease, where an ifand which B o K
they called Hayti was situated, in which that metal J
was more abundant than among them. Columbus '49
ordered his squadron to bend its course thither;
but Martin Alonfo Pinzon, impatient to be the
first who should take poffefion of the treasures
which this country was supposed to contain, quit-
ted his companions, regardless of all the Admiral's
signals to flacken fail until they ihould come up
with him.

COLUMI1BUS, retarded by contrary winds, did nDikond

not reach Hayti till the sixth of December. He Hifpaioa3-
called the port where he first touched St. Nicholas,
and the island itself Efpagnola, in honour of the
kingdom by which he was employed; and it is the
only country, of those he had yet discovered,
which has retained the name that he gave it. As
he could neither meet with the Pinta, nor have any
intercourse with the inhabitants, who fled in great
conflernation towards the woods, he Coon quitted
St. Nicholas, and failing along the northern coast
of the island, he entered another harbour, which
he called Conception. Here he was more fortu-
nate; his people overtook a woman who was flying
from them, and after treating her with great gen-
tlences, dismissed her with a present of such toys
as they knew were most valued in those regions.
The description which she gave to her countrymen
of the humanity and wonderful qualities of the

itrangers;

o o K ifrangers; their admiration of the trinkets, which
1. tlhe shewed with exultation; and their eagerness
*5'' to participate of the fame favours; removed all

their fears, and induced many of them to repair to
the harbour. The strange objets which they be-
held, and the baubles, which Columbus bestowed
upon them, amply gratified their curiosity and
their wilhes. They nearly resembled the people
of Guanahani and Cuba. They were naked like
them, ignorant, and simple; and seemed to be
equally unacquainted with all the arts which ap-
pear molt nccefihry in poliflied societies; but tecy
were gentle, credulous, and timid, to a dcgrec
which rendered it easy to acquire the ascendant
over them, especially as their excefive admiration
led them into the fame error with the people of
the other islands, in believing the Spaniards to be
more than mortals, and descended immediately
from -Heaven. They pofeffed gold in greater
abundance than their neighbours, which they
readily exchanged for bells, beads, or pins; and
in this unequal traffic both parties were highly
pleated, each confidering themselves as gainers by
the tranfadtion. I-lcre Columbus was visited by a
prince or cazique of the country. He appeared
with all the pomp known among a simple people,
being carried in a fort of palanquin upon the
shoulders of four men, and attended by many of
his fubjeas, who served him with great respeCt.

tirved towards his own people, but with Columbus a o o

the admiral some thin plates of gold, and a girdle '14o
of curious workmanship, receiving in return prc-
if nts offmall value, but highly acceptable to him Y.

COLUMBUS, still intent on discovering the mines

which yielded gold, continued to interrogate all the
natives with whom he had any intercourse con-
cerning their situation. They concurred in point-
ing out a mountainous country, which they called
Cibao, at tome distance from the fca, and farther
t,.vrds the east. Struck with this found, which
appeared to him the fame with Ci;ango, the name
by which Marco Polo, and other travellers to the
taft, distinguished the island of Japan, he no longer
doubted with refpet to the vicinity of the countries
which he had discovercd to the remote parts of
Asia; and, in full expecation of reaching soon
those regions which had been the object of his voy-
age, he dirceted his course towards the cast. ile
put into a commodious harbour, which he called St.
Thomas, and found that diltrit to be under the
government of a powerful cazique, named Guaca-
nabari, who, as he afterwards learned, was one of
the five sovereigns among whom the whole island
was divided. lie immediately sent mefelngers to
Columbus, who, in his name, delivered to him the

° the twenty-fourth of December, with a fair wind,

and the sea perfecly calm; and as, amidst the mul-
tiplicity of his occupations, he had not Ihut his
eyes for two days, he retired at midnight in order
to take some repose, having committed the helm
to the pilot, with ftri: injuncions not to quit it for
a moment. The pilot, dreading no danger, care-
lefsly left the helm to an unexperienced cabin boy,
and the fliip, carried away by a current, was dashcd
against a rock. The violence of the shock awak-
ened Columbus. He ran up to the deck. There,
all was confusion and despair. I-te alone retained
prelence of mind. lHe ordered bome of the fltilors
to take a boat, and carry out an anchor astern;
but, inltead of obeying, they made off towards the
Nigna, which was about half a league diltant. IHe
then commanded the malts to be cut down, in

and filled so fast with water that its loss. was inevi- . ",

afiftance of boats from the Nigna, enabled the
crew to save their lives. As soon as the illanders
heard of this disaster, they crowded to the Ihorc,
with their prince Guacanahari at their head. In-
stead of taking advantage of the diltrcfs in which
they beheld the Spaniards, to attempt any thing to
their detriment, t..ey lamented their misfortune
with tears of lincere condolance. Not iatisfied with
this unavailing exprefflon of their sympathy, they
put to sea a number of canoes, and, under the di-
rection of the Spaniards, affifled in saving what-
ever could be got out of the wreck; and by the
united labour of so many hands, almost every thing
of value was carried alhore. As fast as the goods
were landed, Guacanahari in person took charge
of them. By his orders they were all deposited in
one place, and armed centinels were polled, w ho
kept the multitude at a distance, in order to pre-
vent them not only from embezzling, but from .
infpecling too curiously what belonged to their
guests'. Next morning this prince visited Co-
lumbus, who was now on board the Nigna, and
endeavoured to console him for his loss, by offer-
ing all that he possessd to repair it'.

There remained but one vefflel, and that the smalleRs
and most crazy of the squadron, to traverse such a
vast ocean, and carry so many men back to Eu-
rope. Each of those circumstances was alarming,
and filled the mind of Columbus with the utmost
solicitude. The desire of overtaking Pinzon, and
of effacing the unfavourable impreiflons which his
misrepresentations might make in Spain, made it

.erolves to necessary to return thither without delay. The

fertility of the country, and the gentle temper of
the people, had already induced him to form. He
resolved to leae a part of his crew in the ifand,
that, by refidirn there, they might learn the lan-
guage of the natives, study their disposition, ex-
amine the nature of the country, search for mines,
prepare for the commodious settlement of the co-
lony, with which he purposed to return, and thus
secure and facilitate the acquisition of those advan-
tages which he expe&ted from his discoveries.
When he mentioned this to his men, all approved
of the design and from impatience under the fa-

Guacanahari; and his unfiufpicious simplicity fbon
preiented to the admiral a favourable opportunity
of proposing it. Columbus having, in the best
manner he could, by broken words and signs, ex-
pressed sone curiosity to know the cause which had
moved the islanders to fly with such precipitation
upon the approach of his ships, the cazique in-
formed him that the country was much infcfted by
the incursions of certain people, whom he called
Carribeans, who inhabited several islands to the
south-east. These he described as a fierce and
warlike race of men, who delighted in blood, and
devoured the flesh of the prisoners who were To
unhappy as to fall into their hands; and as the
Spaniards, at their first appearance, were supposed
to be Carribeans, whom the natives, however nu-
merous, durst not face in battle, they had recourse
to their usual method of securing their safety, by
flying into the thickest and most impenetrable
woods. Guacanahari, while speaking of those
dreadful invaders, discovered such fynptoms of
terror, as well as such consciousness of the in-.

VOL. r. K ability

B 0 K ability of his own people to resist them, as led Co-

il.
_ 1 lumbus to conclude that he would not be alarmed
'491. at the proposition of any scheme which afforded

him the profpet of an additional security against
their attacks. He inffantly offered him the afliit-
ance of the Spaniards to repel his enemies; he en-
gaged to take him and his people under the pro-
tecion of the powerful monarch whom he served,
and offered to leave in the island such a number of
his men as should be sufficient, not only to defend
the inhabitants from future incursions, but to avenge
their past wrongs.
tuilds a THE credulous prince closed eagerly with the

proposal, and thought himself already safe under
the patronage of beings sprung from Heaven, and
superior in power to mortal men. The ground
was marked out for a finall fort, which Columbus
called LNavidlal, because he had landed there on
Christmas day. A deep ditch was drawn around
it. The ramparts were fortified with pallifades,
and the great guns, saved out of the admiral's ship,
wvere planted upon them. In ten days the work
was finifled; that simple race of men labouring
with inconsiderate afliduity in erecting this first
monument of their own servitude. During this
time, Columbus, by his careses and liberality, la-
boured to increase the high opinion which the na-
tives entertained of the Spaniards. But while he
endeavoured to inspire them with confidence in

their

their disposition to do good, he wilhed likewise to B o K
give them some striking idea of their power to G
punilh and defroy such as were the objets of their 1491.
indignation. With this view, in presence of a vast
assembly, he drew up his men in order of battle,
and made an oflentatious but innocent display of
the sharpness of the Spanilih I'ords, of the force of
their spears, and the operation of their cross-bows.
These rude people, strangers to the use of iron,
and unacquainted with any hostile weapons, but
arrows of reeds pointed with the bones of fishes,
wooden swords, and javelins hardened in the fire,
wondered and trembled. Before this surprise or
fear had time. to abate, he ordered the great guns
to be fired. The sudden explosion struck them
with such terror, that they fell flat to the ground,
covering their faces with their hands; and when
they beheld the astonishing effect of the bullets
among the trees, towards which the cannon had
been pointed, they concluded that it was impollible
to resist men, who had the command of such de-
ftruftive instruments, and who came armed with
thunder and lightning againit their enemies.

AFTER giving such impressions both of the be- Hisinlruc.

neficence and power of the Spaniirds, as might t!"iorl icit
have rendered it easy to prcferve an ascendant over i" i
the minds of the natives, Columbus appointed
thirty-eight of his people to remnain in the island.
-He entrusted the command of these to Diego de

K 2 Arada,

E 0 0 K Arado, a gentleman of Cordova, investing him

IL
,_^. with the fame powers which he himself had re-

'49-' ceived from Ferdinand and Isabella; and furnished

him with every thing requisite for the subsistence
or defence of this infant colony. He ftritly en-
joined them to maintain concord among themselves,
to yield an unreserved obedience to their com-
mander, to avoid giving offence to the natives by
any violence or exaction, to cultivate the friend-
fiip of Gnacanahari, but not to put themselves in
his power, by straggling in finall parties, or march-
ing too far from the fort. He promised to revisit
them soon, with filch a reinforcement of strength
as might enable them to take full polcnion of the
country, and to reap all the fruits of their disco-
veries. In the mean time, he engaged to mention
their names to the king and queen, and to place
their merit and services in the mofl advantageous
light b.

HAVING thus taken every precaution for the si-

curity of the Colony, he left Navidad on the fourth
':,;. of January, one thouland four hundred and ninety-

three, and freering towards the east, dilcovered,
anld gave names to most of the harbours on the
norrhern conaf of the iland. On the sixth, he

endeavoured to justify his condu&, by pretending B O O K
that he had been driven from his course by frefs L 1
of weather, and prevented from returning by con- '493.
trary winds. The admiral, though he still sus-
peted his perfidious intentions, and knew well
what he urged in his own defence to be frivolous as
well as false, was so sensible that this was not a
proper time for venturing upon any high strain of
authority, and felt such fatisfation in this juntion
with his consort, which delivered him from many
disquieting apprehensions, that lame as Pinzon's
apology was, he admitted of it without difficulty,
and restored him to favour. During his absence
from the admiral, Pinzon had visited several har-
bours in the island, had acquired some gold by
trafficking with the natives, but had made no dif-
covery of any importance.

FROM the condition of his ships, as well as the Rrolvs to

ceffary to haften his return to Europe. The for-
mer, having suffered much during a voyage of such
an unusual length, were extremely leaky. The
latter expressed the utmost impatience to revisit
their native country, from which they had been so
long absent, and where they had things so wonderful
and unheard-of to relate. Accordingly, on the
sixteenth of January, he directed his course to-
wards the north-east, and soon loft fight of land.
He had on board some of the natives, whom he

all the produEtions which were likely to become
subje&s of commerce in the several countries, as
well as many unjknown birds, and other natural
curiosities, which might attract the attention of the
learned, or excite the wonder of the people. The
voyage was prosperous to the fourteenth of Febru-
ary, and he had advanced near five hundred leagues

which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every
thing that the naval skill and experience of Colum-
bus could devise was employed, in order to save
the ships. But it was impossible to withstand the
violence of the storm, and, as they were frill fir
from any land, deftrudlion feemced inevitable. The
sailors had recourie to prayers to Almighty God,
to the invocation of faints, to vows and charms,
to every thing that religion dictates, or fupertition
suggests, to the affrighted mind of man. No
profpcd of deliverance appearing, they abandoned
thcmficves to despair, and expcted every moment
to be swallowed up in the waves, Betides the pas-
sions which naturally agitate and alarm the human
mind in filch awful fitiations, when certain death,

to perish; mankind were to be deprived of every * __
benefit that might have been derived from the 4493'
happy success of his schemes, and his own name
would descend to posterity as that of a rath deluded
adventurer, instead of being transmitted with the
honour due to the author and conductor of the
most noble enterprise that had ever been under-
taken. These reflections extinguished all sense of
his own personal danger. Less affe&ed with the
loss of life, than solicitous to preserve the memory
of what he had attempted and atchieved, he retired
to his cabin, and wrote, upon parchment, a short
account of the voyage which he had made, of the
course which he had taken, of the situation and
riches of the countries which he had discovered,
and of the colony that he had left there. Having
wrapped up this in an oiled cloth, which he in-
closed in a cake of wax, he put it into a calk care-
fully stopped up, and threw it into the sea, in hopes
that some fortunate accident might preserve a de-
posit of so much importance to the world'.

crown of Portugal. There, after a violent con-
test with the governor, in which Columbus dif.
played no less spirit than prudence, he obtained a
supply of fresh provisions, and whatever else he
needed. One circumstance, however, greatly dif-
quieted him. The Pinta, of which he had loft
fight on the first day of the hurricane, did not
appear; he dreaded for some time that Ihe had
foundered at sea, and that all her crew had perish-
ed: afterwards, his former suspicions recurred, and
he became apprehensive that Pinzon had borne
away for Spain, that he might reach it before him,
and, by giving the firfl account of his discoveries,
might obtain some lhare of his fame.

hitherto deemed peculiarly their own, and in its _
first eflay, not only rivalling, but cclipfing their ,49.-
fame, Columbus was received with all the marks
of diftinCion due to a man who had performed
things so extraordinary and unexpected. The
king admitted him into his pretence, treated him
with the highest refpe&, and listened to the ac-
count which he gave of his voyage with admiration
mingled with regret. While Columbus, on his
part, enjoyed the fatisfaftion of describing the
importance of his discoveries, and of being now
able to prove the solidity of his schemes to those
very perolns, who, with an ignorance disgraceful
to themselves, and fatal to their country, had
lately rejeced them as the projets of a visionary

COLUMBUS was so impatient to return to Spain, Returnte

that he remained only five days in 1,ifbon. On lpa
the fifteenth of March he arrived in the port of
Palos, fcven months and eleven days from the
time when he set out thence upon his voyage. As
loon as the ship was discovered approaching the
the port, all the inhabitants of Palos ran eagerly
to the shore, in order to welcome their relations
and fellow-citizens, and to hear tidings of their
voyage. When the prosperous issue of it was
known, when they beheld the strange people, the
unknown animals, and singular productions brought

'493' bells were rung, the cannon fired; Columbus was

received at landing with ro",al honours, and all the
people, in solemn procefflon, accompanied him
and his crew to the church, where they returned
thanks to Heaven, which had so wonderfully con-
duEed and crowned with success, a voyage of
greater length and of more importance, than had
been attempted in any former age. On the even-
ing of the fame day, he had the fatisfaaion of

had driven far to the north, enter the harbour.

king and queen, who were then at Barcelona, of
his arrival and fucccfs. Ferdinand and Isabella,
no less aftonilhed than delighted with this unex-
pecEed event, desired Columbus, in terms the
molt refpecful and flattering, to repair immedi-
ately to court, that from his own mouth they
might receive a full detail of his extraordinary
services and discoveries. During his journey to
Barcelona, the people crowded from the adjacent
country, following him every where with admira-
tion and applause. His entrance into the city was
condueed, by order of Ferdinand and Isabella,
'with pomp suitable to the great event, which added
such diftingui(hing lustre to their reign. The
people whom he brought along with him from the

countriesc

countries which he had discovered, marched first, B 00 o
and by their singular complexion, the wild pecu- ,_
liarity of their features, and uncouth finery, ap- 93.
peared like men of another species. Next to
them were carried the ornaments of gold, fashioned
by the rude art of the natives, the grains of
gold found in the mountains, and dust of the fame
metal gathered in the rivers. After these, appeared
the various commodities of the new discovered
countries, together with their curious productions.
Columbus himself closed the proceflion, and at-
traEted the eyes of all the fpecators, who gazed
with admiration on the extraordinary man, whose
superior sagacity and fortitude had condu6ted their
countrymen, by a route concealed from past ages,
to the knowledge of a new world. Ferdinand
and Isabella received him clad in their royal robes,
and feated upon a throne, under a magnificent
canopy. When he approached, they flood up, and
raising him as he kneeled to kifs their hands, com-
manded him to take his feat upon a chair prepared
for him, and to give a circumifantial account of
his voyage. He delivered it with a gravity and
composure no less suitable to the disposition of the
Spanish nation, than to the dignity of the audi-
ence in which he spoke, and with that modest fim-
plicity which charaterifes men of fiperior minds,
who, satisfied with lRaving performed great ations,
court not vain applause by an ostentatious display
of their exploits. When he had finished his nar-

ration,

y49;3 very of those new regions, from which they ex-

peted so many advantages to flow in upon the
kingdoms subjed to their governmente. Every
mark of honour that gratitude or admiration could
suggest was conferred upon Columbus. Letters
patent were issued, confirming to him and to his
heirs all the privileges contained 1i; the capitulation
conl 1u'dd at Santa Si; his family was ennobled;
tl:h king an,! queen, and, after their example, the

cerning the new-found countries, and what division
of the earth they belonged to. Columbus adhered
tenaciously to his original opinion, that they should
be reckoned a part of those val: regions in Asia,
comprehended under the general name of India.
This fcntiment was confirmed by the observations
which he made concerning the productions of the
countries he had discovered. Gold was known tr
abound in India, and he had met with filch, pro-
milnog samples of it in the islands which hle visited,
as led him to believe that rich mines of it miglht
be found. Cotton, another production of the Elall
Indies, was common there. The pimento of the

to set out upon the voyage. Volunteers of every B oO K
rank solicited to be employed. Allured by the * j

and avarice, neither the length nor danger of the
navigation intimidated them. Cautious as Ferdi-
nand was, and averse to every thing new or adven-
turous, he seems to have catched the fame spirit
with his subjects. Under its influence, prepara-
tions for a second expedition were carried on with
a rapidity unusual in Spain, and to an extent that
would be deemed not inconsiderable in the present
age. The fleet consisted of seventeen ships, some
of which were of good burden. It had on board
fifteen hundred persons, among whom were many
of noble families, who had served in honourable
ifations. The greater part of there being destined
to remain in the country, were furnished with every
thing requisite for conquest or settlement, with all
kinds of European domeRfic animals, with such
feeds and plants as were most likely to thrive in
the climate of the Weft Indies, with utensils and
instruments of every fort, and with such artificers
as might be most useful in an infant colony k

B 0 0K made it necelfary to obtain from the Roman pontiff
'-- _ a grant of those territories which they wished to
1493. occupy. The Pope, as the vicar and reprefenta-

tive of Jefis Chrifl, was supposed to have a right
of dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth.
Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every crime
which disgraces humanity, filled the papal throne
at that time. As he was born Ferdinand's fubje&,
and very solicitous to secure the proteeion of Spain,
in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious
schemes in favour of his own family, he was ex-
tremely willing to gratify the Spanish monarchs.
By an act of liberality which cost him nothing, and
that served to eftablilh the jurisdiction and preten.
sions of the papal fee, he granted ih full right to
Ferdinand and Isabella all the countries inhabited
by Infidels, which they had discovered, or lhould
discover; and, in virtue of that power which he
derived from Jesus Christ, he conferred on the
crown of Castile valt regions, to the poffeflion
of which he himrflf was so far from having any
title, that he was unacquainted with their situation,
and ignorant even of their existence. As it was
necefTary to prevent this grant from interfering
with that formerly made to the crown of Portu-
gal, he appointed that a line, flppofed to be drawn
fiom pole to pole, a hundred leagues to the weft-
ward of the Azores, fliould serve as a limit be-
tween them; and, in the plenitude of his power,
bellowed all to the east of this imaginary line upon

Spaniards". Zeal for propagating the Christian A
faith was the consideration employed by Ferdinand 1493.
in soliciting this bull, and is mentioned by Alex-
ander as his chief motive for iffluing it. In order
to manifest some concern for this laudable object,
several friars, under the direcion of Father Boy],
a Catalonian monk of great reputation, as apofto-
lical vicar, were appointed to accompany Colum-
bus, and to devote themselves to the inftru&ion of
the natives. The Indians, whom Columbus had
brought along with him, having received some
tinaure of Christian knowledge, were baptized
with much solemnity, the king himself, the prince
his son, and the chief persons of his court, ltanding
as their godfathers. Those first fruits of the New
World have not been followed by such an increase
as pious men wifled, and had reason to expe&.

which he gave the name of Defeada, en account
of the impatience of his crew to discover some part
of the New World. After'this he visited fuccef-
fively Dominica, Marigalante, Guadalupe, Antiga,
San Juan de Puerto Rico, and several other islands,
scattered in his way as he advanced towards the
north-west. All these he found to be-inhabited by
that fierce race of people whom Guacanahari had
painted in such frightful colours. His descriptions
appeared not to have been exaggerated. The
Spaniards never attempted to land without meet,

tial and daring 'pirit of the natives; and in their
habitations were found relics of those horrid feasts
which they had made upon the bodies of their ene-

It with the necesaries of which he supposed it B 0 0 K
to be in want, he made no flay in any of those
islands, and proceeded dire&ly to Hispaniola'. '493
When he arrived off Navidad, the itation in which
he had left the thirty-eight men under the com-
mand of Arada, he was aftonified that none of
them appeared, and expe&ed every moment to fee
them running with transports of joy to welcome
their countrymen. Full of solicitude about their
safety, and foreboding in his mind what had be-
fallen them, he rowed instantly to land. All the
natives from whom he might have received inform-
ation had fled. But the fort which he had built
was entirely demolilhed, and the tattered garments,
the broken arms and utensils scattered about it, left
no room to doubt concerning the unhappy fate of
the garrison'. While the Spaniards were shedding
tears over those fad memorials of their fellow-citi-
zens, a brother of the cazique Guacanahari arrived.
From him Columbus received a particular detail The fate of

with the Spaniards tended gradually to diminish the
superstitious veneration with which their firlt ap.

own indiscretion and ill condut, the Spaniards
speedily effaced those favourable imprefllons, and

B o o K soon convinced the natives, that they had all the

. wants, and weaknesses, 'and paflions of men. As
1493- soon as the powerful restraint which the presence

and authority of Columbus impoied was withdrawn,
the garrison threw off all regard for the officer
whom he had invclted with command. Regardless
of the prudent inftrutions which he had given
them, every man became independent, and gra.
tified his desires without control. The gold, the
women, the provisions of the natives, were all the
prey of tholi licentious oppressors. They roamed
in small parties over the island, extending their ra-
pacity and insolence to every corner of it. Gentle
and timid as the people were, those unprovoked
injuries at length exhausted their patience, and
rouzed their courage. The cazique of Cibao,
whole country the Spaniards chiefly infested on
account of the gold which it contained, surprised
and cut offfeveral of them, while they straggled in
as perse& security as if their conduEt had been al-
together inoffenlive. He then assembled his sub-
jeCts, and lfrrounding the fort, set it on fire. Some
of the Spaniards were killed in defending it, the
reft perished in attempting to make their escape by
crofling an arm of the sea. Guacanahari, whom
all their exactions had not alienated from the Spa-
niards, took arms in their behalf, and, in endeavour-
ing to proteec them, had received a wound, by
which he was lill confined .

THOUGl

THouo H. this account was far Irom removing the B o0 K

fifpicions which the Spaniards entertained with re- -.-.
fpe& to the fidelity of Guacanahari, Columbus per- His.d't
ceived so clearly that this was not a proper juncture condu".
for inquiring into his conduct with scrupulous ac-
curacy, that he rejeted the advice of several of his
officers, who urged him to seize the person of that
prince, and to revenge the death of their country-
men by attacking his fuibjeds. He represented to
them the necessity of securing the friend lhip of
some potentate of the country, in order to facilitate
the settlement which they intended, and the danger
of driving the natives to unite in some dcfperate
attempt against them, by such an ill-timed and un-
availing exercile of rigour. Instead of wafting his
time in punihfing past wrongs, he took precautions
for preventing any future injury. With this view
he made choice of a situation more healthy and
commodious than that of Navidad. He traced
out the plan of a town in a large plain near a spa-
cious bay, and obliging every person to put his
hand to a work on which their common safety de-
pended, the houses and ramparts were soon so far
advanced by their united labour, as to afford them
ihelter and security. This rising city, the first that
the Europeans founded in the New World, he
named Isabella, in honour of his patroness the
queen of Castile r.

country, but he had to contend with what was
more insuperable, the laziness, the impatience, and
mutinous disposition of his followers. By the
enervating influence of a hot climate, the natural in.
activity of the Spaniards seemed to increase. Many
of them were gentlemen, unaccustomed to the fa.
tigue of bodily labour, and all had engaged in the
enterprise with the sanguine hopes excited by the
splendid and exaggerated description of their coun.
trymen who returned from the first voyage, or by
the mistaken opinion of Columbus, that the country
which he had discovered was either the Cipango of
Marco Polo, or the Ophir', from which Solomon
imported those precious commodities which fud-
denly diffused such extraordinary riches through
his kingdom. But when, instead of that golden
harvest which they had expe&ed to reap without
toil or pains, the Spaniards saw that their profpet
of wealth was remote as well as uncertain, and that it
could not be attained but by the flow and perfever-
ing efforts ofinduftry, the disappointment ofthofe
chimerical hopes occasioned such dejetion of mind
as bordered on despair, and led to general difcon-
tent. In vain did Columbus endeavour to revive
their spirits by pointing out the fertility of the foil,

which, by allowing his people leisure to brood over iEntamn

the interior part of the country. He sent a de-
tachment, under the command of Alonfo de Ojeda,
a vigilant and enterprising officer, to visit the di-
ftri& of Cibao, which was said to yield the greatest
quantity of gold, and followed him ir person with
the main body of his troops. In this expedition, March ,.
he displayed all the pomp of military magnificence
that he could exhibit, ir order to firike the ima-
gination of he natives. He marched with colours

B o OK sometimes in the rear. As those were the first

11 horses which appeared in the New World, they
'494- were objecs of terror no less than of admiration to

the Indians, who having no tame animals them-
selves, were unacquainted with that vast accession
of power, which man hath acquired by fubjeting
them to his dominion. They supposed them to
be rational creatures. They imagined that the
horse and the rider formed one animal, with whose
speed they were aflonilhed, and whose impetuosity
and strength they confidered as irrefiflible. But
while Columbus endeavoured to inspire the natives
with a dread of his power, he did not neglea the
arts of gaining their love and confidence. He ad-
hered scrupulously to the principles of integrity and
justice in all his tranfaftions with them, and treated
them on every occasion, not only with humanity,
but with indulgence. The diftrit bs Cibao an-
fwered the description given of it by the natives.
It was mnuntainous and uncultivated, but in every
river and brook gold was gathered either in duff
or in grains, rome of which were of considerable
size. The Indians had never opened any mines in
search of gold. To penetrate into the bowels of
the earth, and to refine the rude ore, were opera-
tions too complicated and laborious for their talents
and industry, and they had no such high value for
gold as to put their ingenuity and invention upon
the stretch in order to obtain it ". The fnall quan-

was either picked up in the beds of the rivers, or . -..-a
waffed from the mountains by the heavy rains that I49-
fall within the tropics. But, from those indica-
tions, the Spaniards could no longer doubt that the
country contained rich treasures in its bowels, of
which they hoped loon to be masters". In order
to secure the command of this valuable province,
Columbus erected a small fort, to which he gave
the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridicule upon
some of his incredulous followers, who would not
believe that the country produced gold, until they
saw it with their own eyes, and touched it with
their hands'.

THE account of those promising appearances of Thediftref

wealth in the country of Cibao came very season- feaion of
ably to comfort the desponding colony, which was thrinecal
affe&ed with distresses of various kinds. The
stock of provisions which had been brought from
Europe was mostly confumedi what remained was
so much corrupted by the heat and moisture of the
climate, as to be almost unfit for use; the natives
cultivated so small a portion of ground, and with
so little ikill, that it hardly yielded what was fuffi-
cient for their own subsistence; the Spaniards at
Isabella had hitherto neither time nor leisure to

mer voyage, who, by, their splendid but deceitful
descriptions of Hispaniola, had allured them to quit
Spain for a barbarous uncultivated land, where
they mufl either be cut off by famine, or die of
unknown distempers. Several of the officers and
persons of note, instead of checking, joined in those
editious complaints. Father Boyl, the apoftolical
vicar, was one of the most turbulent and outrage-
ous. It required all the authority and address of
Columbus to re-establish Subordination and tran-
quillity in the colony, Threats and promises were
alternately employed for this purpose; but nothing
contributed more to sooth the malcontents, than
the profpe&t of finding, in the mines of Cibao, such
a rich store oftreafure as would be a recompence
for all their sufferings, and efface the memory of
former disappointments.

his brother Don Diego, with the alifiance of a
council of officers, to govern the island in his ab-
fence; and gave the command of a body of soldiers
to Don Pedro Margarita, with which he was to
visit the different parts of the illand, and endeavour
to establiSh the authority of the Spaniards among
the inhabitants. Having left them very particu-
lar inftruaions with refpe& to their condut, be
weighed anchor on the twenty-fourth of April,
with one ship and two small barks under his com-
mand. During a tedious voyage of full five
months, he had a trial of almost all the numerous
hardships to which persons of his proflfion are cx-
posed, without making any discovery of importance,
except the island of Jamaica. As he ranged along
the southern coast of Cuba', he was entangled
in a labyrinth formed by an incredible number
of small islands, to which he gave the name of the
Qleen's Garden. In this unknown cburfe, among

often almost inccfrant between the tropics. At
length his provisions fell flort; his crew, exhausted
with fatigue as well as hunger, murmured and
threatened, and were ready to proceed to the most
desperate extremities against him. Beset with dan-
ger in such various forms, he was obliged to keep
continual watch, to obfcrve every occurrence with

extent of his kill and experience as a navigator so
much tried. To thcfc the squadron owed its safety.
But this unremitted fatigue of body, and intense
application of mind, overpowering his constitution,
though naturally vigorous and robust, brought on a
feverish disorder, which terminated in a lethargy,
that deprived him of sense and memory, and had
almost proved fatal to his life ".

between them. Bartholomew, after finishing his _--
negociation in the court of England, had set out 1494
for Spain by the way of France. At Paris he re-
ceived an account of the extraordinary discoveries
which his brother had made in his first voyage, and
that he was then preparing to embark on a second
expedition. Though this naturally induced him to
pursue his journey with the utmost dispatch, the
admiral had failed for Hispaniola before he reached
Spain. Ferdinand and Ilabella received him with
the refpeet due to the nearest kinfinin of a person
whose merit and fcrvices rendered him so confpi-
cuous; and as they knew what confolati.n his pre-
fence would afford to his brother, they persuaded
him to take the command of three ships, which
they had appointed to carry provisions to the co-
lony at Ifabellaz.

For although the provisions now brought from
Europe, afforded a temporary relief to the Spani-

the island did not hitherto yield what was sufficient

a another danger, Rfill more formidable than the re.

diate attention. No sooner did Columbus leave the
island on his voyage ofdifcovery, than the soldien
under Margarita, as if they had been set free from
discipline and subordination, scorned all restraint.
Instead of conforming to the prudent inftrustions
of Columbus, they dilperfed in straggling parties
over the island, lived at discretion upon the natives,
wafted their provisions, seized their women, and
treated that inoffensive race with all the insolence
of military oppreflion '.

As long as the Indians had any profpe& that

their sufferings might come to a period by the vo-
luntary departure of the invaders, they Submitted in
silence, and diflembled their sorrow; but they now
perceived that the yoke would be as permanent as
it was intolerable. The Spaniards had built a
town, and surrounded it with ramparts. They
had ereaed forts in different places. They had
enclosed and sown several fields. It was apparent
that they came not to visit the country, but to set-
tle in it. Though the number of those strangers
was inconsiderable, the state of cultivation among
this rude people was so imperfet, and in such exa&
proportion to their own consumption, that it was

with difficulty they could aff'ord subsistence to their B oO K
new guests. Their own mode of life was so indolent "_j
and inafaie, the warmth of the climate so enervating, '49
the confitution of their bodies naturally so feeble,
and so unaccustomed to the laborious exertions of
industry, that they were satisfied with a proportion
of food amazingly small. A handful of maize, ora
little of the insipid bread made of the caffada-root,
was sufficient to support men, whose strength and
spirits were not exhausted by any vigorous efforts
either of body or mind. The Spaniards, though
the mos abstemious of all the European nations,
appeared to. them excessively voracious. One
Spaniard consumed as much as several Indians.
This keenness of appetite surprised them so much,
and seemed to be so insatiable, that they supposed
the Spaniards had left their own country, because
it did not produce as much as was requisite to gra-
tify their immoderate desire of food, and had come
among them in quef of nourilhment b. Self-pre-
servation prompted them to with for the departure
of guess who wafted so fast their slender Rtock of
provisions. The injuries which they suffered,
added to their impatience for this event. They
had long expected that the Spaniards would retire
of their own accord. They now perceived that, in
order to avert the deltruCtion with which they were
threatened, either by the flow consumption of fa-
mine, or by the violence of their oppressors, it was

War with SUCH were the sentiments which universally pre-

vailed among the Indians, when Columbus re-
turned to Isabella. Inflamed by the unprovoked
outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree of rage
of which their gentle natures, formed to susser and
submit, seemed hardly susceptible, they waited only
for a signal from their leaders to fall upon the co-
lony. Some of the caziques had already surprised
and cut off several firagglers. The dread of this
impending danger united the Spaniards, and re-
established the authority of Columbus, as they saw
no prospect of safety but in committing themselves
to his prudent guidance. It was now necessary to
have recourse to arms, the employing of which
againit the Indians, Columbus had hitherto avoided
with the greatelf solicitude. Unequal as the con-
flic may seem, between the naked inhabitants of
the New World, armed with clubs, flicks hard-
ened in the fire, wooden swords, and arrows pointed
with bones or flints; and troops accultomed to the
discipline, and provided with the instruments of
deltruCion known in the European art of war, the
situation of the Spaniards was far from being exempt
from danger. The vail liiperiority of the natives

were teduced to a very small number. Dfeafes,
engendered by the warmth and humidity of' the
country, or dccafioned by their own licentdoiufnes,
had raged among them with much violence; e*-

Coluiibtis had hitherto iriculcated, with refpea to
the mode of treatiing'them. But intrigues were
carrying' on in the cOurt'of Spain at this juncture,
·in order to undeteriniie his power, and discredit" hs
operations, which constrained him to depart from
his own system of administration. Several' unfa-
vourable accounts of his condu&t, as well as of the
countries discovered by him, had been transmitted
to Spain. Margarita and Father Boyl were now at
court; and in order to justify their own conduct,
or to gratify. their resentment, watched with male-
volent attention for every opportunity of spreading
insinuations to his detriment. Many of the cour-
tiers viewed his growing reputation and power with
envious eyes. Fonseca, archdeacon of Seville,
who was entrusted with the chief diretion of In-
dian affairs, had conceived such an unfavourable
opini6h of Columbus, for some reason which the
contemporary writers have not mentioned, that he
listened with partiality. to every inveaive against
him. It was not cafy for an unfriended stranger,
unpratifed in courtly arts, to counteract the ma-
chinations of To many enemies. Columbus saw that
there was but one method of supporting his own
credit, and of silencing all his adversaries. He
muff produce filch a quantity of gold as would

gour; and may be pleaded in excuse for Iis de-
viating on this occasion from the mildnerfs and
humanity with which' he uniformly treated that un-
happy people.-

recourse to an expedient for obtaining deliverance
from this yoke, which demonfirates the excefl of
their impatience and despair. They formed a
scheme of starving those oppressors whom they
durst not attempt to expel; and from the' opinion
which they entertained with respect to the vora-

execution of it to 'be very'prascicable. With this

This desperate resolution ptoduced in some degree t+9s'
the cffets which they expeced. The Spaniards
were reduced to extreme want; but they received
such seasonable supplies of provisions from Europe,
and found so many resources in their own ingenuity
and industry, that they suffered no great loss of
men. The wretched Indians were the viaims of
their own ill-concerted policy. A great moltitude
of people, shut up in the mountainous or wooded
part of the country, without any food but the fpon.
taneous productions of the earth, soon felt the ut-
most distresses of famine. This brought on conta-

B O K were all represented as the effects of his restless and

- inconsiderate ambition. His prudent attention to
1495. preserve discipline and subordination was deno,

minated excess of rigour; the punishments which
he inflited upon the mutinous and disorderly were
imputed to cruelty. There accusations gained such
credit in a jealous court, that a commifloner was
appointed to repair to Hispaniola, and to infpe&
into the conduct of Columbus. By the recom-
mendation of his enemies, Aguado, a groom of the
bed-chamber, was the person to whom this import-
ant trust was committed. But in this choice they
seem to have been more influenced by the obfe-
quious attachment of the man to their interest,
than by his capacity for the flation. Puffed up
with such sudden elevation, Aguado displayed, in
the exercise of this office, all the frivolous self-
importance, and aAed with all the disgusting info-
lence, which are natural to little minds, when raited
to unexpe&ed dignity, or employed in fimutions
to which they are not equal. By listening with
eargernefs to every accusation against Columbus,
and encouraging not only the malcontent Spa-
niards, but even the Indians, to produce their grie-
vances, real or imaginary, he fomented the spirit of
dissension in the island, without eflablilhing any re-
gulation of public utility, or that tended to redress
the many wrongs, with the odium of which he
wished to load the admiral's adminifiration. As
Columbus felt sensibly how humiliating his fitua-

tion

tion must be, if he should remain in the country B 0 o K
while such a partial infpeEtor observed his motions, i n.
and controlled his jurifdi&ion, he took the refolu-. 45s
tion of returning to Spain, in order to lay a full
account of all his tranfaftions, particularly with re-
fpe& to the points in dispute between him and his
adversaries, before Ferdinand and Isabella, from
whose justice and discernment he expe&ed an equal
and a favourable decision. He committed the ad- 1496.
ministration of affairs, during his absence, to Don
Bartholomew his brother, with the title of Adelan-
tado, or Lieutenant Governor. By a choice less
fortunate, and which proved the source of many
calamities to the colony, he appointed Francis
Roldan chief justice, with very extensive powers'.

IN returning to Europe, Columbus held a course Rturns t

different from that which he had taken in his for- Spain.
mner voyage. He ifeered almost due east from
Htfpaniola, in the parallel of twenty-two degrees
of latitude; as experience had not yet discovered
the more certain and expeditious method of iretch-
ing to the north, in order to fall in witli the south-
well winds. By this ill-advifed choice, which, in
the infancy of navigation between the New and
Old Worlds, can hardly be imputed to the admi-
ral as a defe in naval lkill, he was expoiid to in..
finite fatigue and danger, in a perpetual ftrugg{e

At length his provisions began to fail, the crew
was reduced to the scanty allowance of fix ounces of
bread a-day for each person. The admiral fared
0o better than the meanest sailor, But, even in
this extreme diltrefs, he retained the humanity
which diflinguifhes his charater, and refused to
comply with the earnest solicitations of his crew,
some of whom proposed to feed upon the Indian
prisoners whom they were carrying over, and
others infiRed to throw them over-board, in order
to lessen the consumption of their small flock. He
represented that they were human beings, reduced
by a common calamity to the fame condition with
themfclves, and entitled to Ihare an equal fate. His
authority and remonllrances diafipated. those wild
ideas fuggefled by derpair. Nor had they time to

The gold, the pearls the cotton, and other com-
modities of value which Columbus produced,
seemed fully to refute what the malcontents had
propagated with refpe& to the poverty of the
country. By reducing the Indians to obedience,
and imposing a regular tax upon them, he had fe-
cured to Spain a large accession of new subjects,
and the eftabliffiment of a revenue that promised
to be considerable. By the mines which he had
found out and examined, a source of wealth till
more copious was opened. Great and unexpeced
as those advantages were, Columbus represented
them only as preludes to future acquilitions, and
as the earnest of more important discoveries, which
he fill meditated, and to which those he had al-
ready made would conduct him with cafe and cer-

B o o K the colony in Hispaniola with every thing which
-- .i could render it a permanent establishment, and to
*6. furnish Columbus with such a fleet, that he might

proceed to search for those new countries, of whose
existence he seemed to be confident. The mea.
fures most proper for accomplishing both these de-
fgns were concerted with Columbus. Discovery
had been the sole objecQ of the first voyage to the
New World; and though, in the second, fettle.
ment had been proposed, the precautions taken for
that purpose had either been insufficient, or were
rendered ineffedual by the mutinous spirit of the
Spaniards, and the unforeseen calamities arificg
from various causes. Now a plan was to be formed
of a regular colony, that might serve as a model
in all future establishments. Every particular was
confidered with attention, and the whole arranged
with a scrupulous accuracy. The precise number
of adventurers who should be permitted to embark
was fixed. They were to be of different ranks
and profeflions; and the proportion of each was
eftablified, according to their ufefvlnefs and the
wants of the colony. A suitable number of wo-
men was to be chosen to accompany there new
settlers. As it was the first object to raise provi-
£ions in a country where scarcity of food had been
the occasion of (b much distress, a considerable
body of hulhandlnen was to be carried over. As
the Spaniards had then no conception of deriving
any be e!tit fioli: those produdtilns of thel Npv

World which have since yielded such large returns B o K
of wealth to Europe, but had formed magnificent ,v-_
ideas, and entertained sanguine hopes with respect 146.
to the riches contained in the mines which had
been discovered, a band of workmen, skilled in the
various arts employed in digging and refining the
precious metals, was provided. All these emigrants
were to receive pay and fubfiftance for some years,
at the public expence k.

THUS far the regulations were prudent, and well A de&aia
adapted to the end in view. But as it was foreseen i'
that few would engage voluntarily to fettle. in a
country, whose noxious climate had been fatal
to so many of their countrymen, Columbus pro-
posed to transport to Hispaniola such malefators
as had been convicted of crimes, which, though
capital, were of a lets atrocious nature; and that
for the future a certain proportion of the offenders
Dually sent to the gallies, Ihould be condemned to
labour in the mines which were to be opened.
This advice, given without due refletion, was as
inconsiderately adopted. The prisons of Spain
were drained, in order to colled members for the
intended colony; and the judges'empowered to try
criminals, were inflruted to recruit it by their fu.
ture sentences. It is not, however, with such ma-
terials that the foundations of a society, destined
to be permanent, should be laid. Industry, fb-

the political body, the vices of those unsound and

and must certainly be producive of violent and

partly by that tedious formality and spirit of pro-

Afbonilhed at the reception which he met with
upon his return, and overawed by his presence,
they gave way, for some time, to a tide of favour
too strong for them to oppose. Their enmity,
however, was too inveterate to remain long in-
aftive. They refunmed their operations, and by
the atliftance of Fonfcca, the rminifter for Indian
affairs, who was now promoted to the bishopric of
Badajos, they threw in so many obstacles to pro-
;rat the preparations for Columbus's expedition,
that a year elapsed before he could procure two

came under the equinoctial line, and then to itretch
to the weft before the favourable wind for such t
course, which blows invariably between the tro-

at the Canary, and then at the Cape de Verd

his ihips with a supply of provisions for the colony
in Hispaniola: with the other three, he continued
his voyage towards the south. No remarkable oc-
currence happened until they arrived within five
JIuy 19. degrees of the line. There they were becalmed,

and at the fame time the heat became so excessive,
that many of their wine casks burif, the liquor in
others toured, and their provisions corrupted'.
The Spaniards, who had never ventured so far to
the south, were afraid that the ships would take
fire, and began to apprehend the reality of what
the ancients had taught concerning the deftrustive
qualities of that torrid region of the globe. They
were relieved, in some mcafilres from their fears
by a seasonable fall of rain. This, however, though
so heavy and unintermitting that the men could
hardly keep the deck, did not greatly mitigate the
intenseness of the heat. The admiral, who with

trained him to yield to the importunities of his
crew, and to alter his course to the north-west, in
order to reach some of the Caribbee islands, where
he might refit, and be supplied with provisions.

ON the firit of August, the man fRationed in nrfovrs

the round top furpriled them with the joyful cry ,hent of^
of land. They flood towards it, and discovered a ',ia.
considerable island, which the admiral called Tri-
nidad, a name it fRill retains. It lies on the coast
of Guiana, near the mouth of the Orinoco. This,
though a river only of the third or fourth magni-
tude in the New World, far furpafies any of the
freams in our hemisphere. It rolls towards the
ocean such a vast body of water, and rushes into it
withfilch impetuous force, that when it meets the
tide, which on that coast rites to an uncommon
height, their collision occasions a swell and agita.

1498. As soon as the consternation which this occasioned3

permitted him to reflec upon the nature of an ap-
pearance so extraordinary, he discerned in it a
source of comfort and hope. He justly concluded,
that such a vast body of water as this river con-
tained, could not be supplied by any island, but
mull flow through a country of immense extent,
and of consequence that he was now arrived at
that continent which it had long been the obje&
of his wifles to discover. Full of this idea, he
stood to the weft along the coast of those provinces
which are now known by the names of Paria and
Cumana. He landed in several places, and had some
intercourse with the people, who resembled those
of Hispaniola in their appearance and manner of
life. They wore, as ornaments, small plates of
gold, and pearls of considerable value, which they
willingly exchanged for European toys. They
seemed to possess a better underItanding, and
greater courage than the inhabitants of the islands.
The country produced four-footed animals of fe-
veral kinds, as well as a great variety of fowls and
fruits '. The admiral was so much delighted with
its beauty and fertility, that with the warm enthu-
fiafin of a discoverer, he imagined it to be the

not only of discovering to mankind the existence
of a New World, but made considerable progress
towards a perse& knowledge of it; and was the
firif man who condu&ed the Spaniards to that vast
continent which has been the chief feat of their
empire, and the source of their treasures in this
quarter of the globe. The hattered condition of
his ihips, scarcity of provisions, his own infirmi-
ties, together with the impatience of his crew,
prevented him from pursuing his discoveries any
farther, and made it necessary to bear away for His-
paniola. In his way thither he discovered the
islands of Cubagua and Margarita, which after-
wards became remarkable for their pearl-fifhery.
When he arrived at Hispaniola, he was wafted to Aug. 304
an extreme degree with fatigue and sickness, but
found the affairs of the colony in such a situation,
as afforded him no profpe& of enjoying that re-
pose of which he flood so much in need.

"_on the opposite fide of the island, and laid the
J49*. foundation of St. Domingo", which was long the

most considerable European town in the New
World, and the feat of the supreme courts in the
Spanish dominions there. As soon as the Spa.
niards were cftablifhed in this new settlement, the
adelantado, that they might neither languish in in-
activity, nor have leisure to form new cabals,
marched into those parts of the island which his
brother had not yet visited or reduced to obedi-
ence. As the people were unable to resist, they
submitted every where to the tribute which he
imposed. But they soon found the burden to be
so intolerable, that, overawed as they were by
the superior power of their oppressors, they took
arms against them. Those infurretions, how-
ever, were not formidable. A conflic with timid
and naked Indians was neither dangerous nor of
doubtful issue.

to be the guardian of order and tranquillity in the
colony. A turbulent and inconsiderate ambition

unbecoming his rank. The arguments which he B O O K
employed to reduce his countrymen were frivolous __
and ill-founded. He accused Columbus and his 1498
two brothers of arrogance and fevcrity; he pre-
tended that they aimed at establishing an independ-
ent dominion in the country; he taxed them with
an intention of cutting off part of the Spaniards
by hunger and fatigue, that they might more easily
reduce the remainder to fubjetion; he reprefcnted
it as unworthy of Castilians, to remain the tame
and passive saves of three Genoese adventurers.
As men have always a propensity to impute the
hardships of which they feel the pressure, to the
misconduct of their rulers; as every nation views
with a jealous eye the power and exaltation of so-
reigners, Roldan's insinuations made a deep im-
pression on his countrymen. His chara&er and
rank added weight to them. A considerable num-
ber of the Spaniards made choice of him as their
leader, and taking arms againfi the adelantado and
his brother, seized the king's magazine of provi-
sions, and endeavoured to surprise the fort at St.
Domingo. This was pref:rvcd by the vigilance
and courage of Don Diego Columbus. The mu-
tineers were obliged to retire to the province of
Xaragua, where they conrimned not only to dif-
claim the adelantado's aucho;it-v t:e!cinflvcs, but ex-

BOO K SUCH was the difiraced slate of the colony

. , when Columbus landed at St. Domingo. He was
458.a altonifhed to find that the three hips which he had

dilpatched from the Canaries were not yet arrived.
By the unfkilfulnefs of the pilots, and the violence
of currents, they had been carried a hundred and
sixty miles to the weft of St. Domingo, and forced
to take lhelter in a harbour of the province of
Xaragua, where Roldan and his seditious follow-
ers were cantoned. Roldan carefully concealed
from the commanders of the ships his infurretion
against the adelantado, and employing his utmost
address to gain their confidence, persuaded them
to set on Ihore a considerable part of the new set-
tiers whom they brought over, that they might
proceed by land to St. Domingo. It required but
few arguments to prevail with those men to
cfpoufe his cause. 'Ihey were the refuse of the
jails of Spain, to whom idleness, licentiousness,
and deeds of violence were familiar; and they re-
turned eagerly to a course of life nearly resembling
tInt to which they had been accullomed. The
eclnmanders of the Ihips perceiving, when it was
too late, their imprudence in disembarking so
many of their men, stood away for St. Domingo,
and got safe into the port a few days after the ad-
miral; but their flock of provisions was so wafted
during a voyage of fcll long continuance, that
they brought little relief to the colony'.

deftrution. At the fame time, he observed, that
the prejudices and paflions which incited the rebels
to take arms, had so far infected those who fill
adhered to him, that many of them were adverse,
and all cold to the service. From such sentiments,
with refpet to the public interest, as well as from
this view of his own situation, he chose to nego-
ciate rather than to fight. By a fcafonable pro-
clamation, offering free pardon to such as ihould
merit it by returning to their duty, he made im-
pression upon some of the malcontents. By en-
gaging to grant such as ihould desire it the liberty
of returning to Spain, he allured all those unfor-
tunate adventurers, who, from sickness and difap-
pointment, were disgusted with the country. By
promising to re-eftablilh Roldan in his former
office, he soothed his pride; and, by complying
with most of his demands in behalf of his fol-
lowers, he satisfied their avarice. Thus, gradually

_' gociations, he dissolved this dangerous combination

the appearance of order, regular government, and
tranquillity y.

A new IN consequence of this agreement with the mu-
modc of set-
tlrcen, tineers, lands were allotted them in different parts

tion of ground for the use of those new matiers.

place of the tribute formerly imposed; and how
necessary lbcver such a regulation might be in a
lickly and feeble colony, it introduced among the
Spaniards the Repartimientos, or distributions of
Indians established by them in all their settlements,
which brought numberless calamities upon that
unhappy people, and fubjeEted them to the most
grievous oppreffionz. This was not the only bad
effect of the insurrection in Hispaniola; it pre-
vented Columbus from prosecuting his discoveries
on the continent, as felf-prefervation obliged him
to keep near his person his brother the adelantado,
and the sailors whom he intended to have em-
ploycd in that service. As soon as his affairs
would permit, he sent some of his flips to Spain

its dissolution, but of having obftrusted every

their unprovoked rebellion against their superiors,
and proposed several regulations for the better
government of the island, as well as the extinction
of that mutinous spirit, which, though fupprefled
at present, might soon burst out with additional
rage. Roldan and his associates did not neglect to
convey to Spain, by the fame flips, an apology
for their own conduct, together with their recri-
minations upon the admiral and his brothers. Un-
fortunately for the honour of Spain, and the hap-
piness of Columbus, the latter gained most credit

B 0 0 K and their conneCtion with the history of the New

11.
---..- *World. While Columbus was engaged in his fuc-

'4993 ceffive voyages to the weft, the spirit of discovery

did not languish in Portugal, the kingdom where
it first acquired vigour, and became enterprising.
Self-condemnation and regret were not the only
sentiments to which the success of Columbus, and
reflection upon their own imprudence in rejecting
his proposals, gave rife among the Portuguese.
They excited a general emulation to surpass his
performances, and an ardent desire to make some
reparation to their country for their own error.
With this view, Emanuel, who inherited the en-
terprifing genius of his predecessors, perrifted in
their grand scheme of opening a passage to the
East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, and soon
after his acceflion to the throne, equipped a fqua-
dron for that important voyage. He gave the
command of it to Vasco de Gama, a man of noble
birth, poffefled of virtue, prudence, and courage,
equal to the ltation. The squadron, like all those
fitted out for discovery in the infancy of naviga-
tion, was extremely feeble, confifing only of three
vessels, of neither burden nor force adequate to the
service. As the Europeans were at that time little
acquainted with the course of the trade-winds and
periodical monsoons, which render navigation in
the Atlantic ocean, as well as in the Tea that separates
Africa from India, at some seasons easy, and at others
not only dangerous, but almost impracticable, the

time

time chosen for Gama's departure was the moe f B 00 K
improper during the whole year. He set fail from . -,
Lisbon on the ninth of July, and standing towards 499s
the south, had to firuggle for four months with '497-
contrary winds, before he could reach the Cape
of Good Hope. Here their violence began to Nov.
abate; and during an interval of calm weather,
Gama doubled that formidable promontory, which
had so long been the boundary of navigation, and
directed his course towards the north-east, along
the African cafit. He touched at several ports;
and after various adventures, which the Portuguese
historians relate with high but just encomiums upon
his conduct and intrepidity, he came to anchor be-
fore the city of Melinda. Throughout all the valt
countries which extend along the coast of Africa,
from the the river Senegal to the confines of Zan-
guebar, the Portuguese had found a race of men
rude and uncultivated, strangers to.ietters, to arts,
and commerce, and differing from the inhabtants
of Europe, no less in their features and complexion,
than in their manners and institutions. As they
advanced from this, they obfcrved, to their inex-
prcflible joy, that the human form gradually al-
tered and improved; the Asiatic features began to
predominate, marks of civilization appeared, letters
were known, the Mahometan religion was ella-
blilied, and a commerce, far from being inconfi-
derable, was carried on. At that time ftveral vefl
fels from India were in the port of Melinda. Gama

B o o i now pursued his voyage with almost absolute cer.

-^ j tainty of success, and, under the conduct of a Ma-
1499. hometan pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon the coast

of Malabar,on the twenty-fecond of May one thou.
sand four hundred and ninety-eight. What he be.
held of the wealth, the populousness, the cultiva-
tion, the industry and arts of this highly civilized
country, far surpassed any idea that he had formed,
from the imperfect accounts which the Europeans
had hitherto received of it. But as he possessed
neither sufficient force to attempt a settlement, nor
proper commodities with which lie could carry on
commerce of any confcqucnce, he hastened back
to Portugal, with an account of his success in per-
forming a voyage, the longest, as well as most dif-
ficult, that had ever been made, since the first in-
vention of navigation. He landed at Lisbon on
the fourteenth of September, one thousand four
hundred and ninety-nine, two years two months
and five days from the time he left that port .

THUS, during the couriif of the fifteenth cen-

tury, mankind made greater progress in exploring
the slate of the habitable globe, than in all the ages
which had elapsed previous to that period. The
spirit of discovery, feeble at first and cautious,
moved within a very narrow sphere, and made its
efforts with hesitation and timidity. Encouraged
by success, it became adventurous, and boldly ex-

tended its operations. In the course of its progref- B o o K
sion, it continued to acquire vigour, and advanced . I
at length with a rapidity and force which burst '49.
through all the limits within which ignorance and
fear had hitherto circumscribed the aaivity of the
human race. Almost fifty years were employed
by the Portuguese in creeping along the coast of
Africa from Cape Non to Cape de Verd, the latter
(f which lies only twelve degrees to the south of
the former. In less than thirty years they ven-
tured beyond the equinoclial line into another
hemisphere, and penetrated to the southern ex-
tremity of Africa, at the distance of forty-nine de-
grees from Cape de Verd. During the last seven
years of the century, a New World was discovered
in the weft, not inferior in extent to all the parts
of the earth with which mankind were at that time
acquainted. In the east, unknown seas and coun-
tries were found out, and a communication, long
desired, but hitherto concealed, was opened be-
tween Europe and the opulent regions of India.
In comparison with events so wonderful and unex-
pected, all that had hitherto been deemed great or
Iplendid, faded away and disappeared. Valt ob-
jets now presented themselves. The human mind,
roused and interested by the profped, engaged with
ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its acfive
powers in a new diretion.

7 TH

B 0 O K THIS spirit of enterprise, though but newly

II.

^ v-V awakened in Spain, began soon to operate exten.
Di4rie. fively. All the attempts towards discovery made
carriedon in in that kingdom, had hitherto been carried on by
bpain by
private ad Columbus alone, and at the expence of the lovc-
vnt-;i,'. reign. But now private adventurers, allured by

the magnificent descriptions he gave of the regions
which he had visited, as well as by the specimens
of their wealth which he produced, offered to fit
out squadrons at their own risk, and to go in
quell of new countries. The Spanish court, whose
scanty revenues were exhausted by the charge of
of its expeditions to the New World, whicl,
though t;cy opened alluring profpecs of future
benefit, yielded a very sparing return of present
profit, was extremely willing to devolve the bur-
den of discovery upon its fubjeLs. It seized with
joy an opportunity of rendering the avarice, the
ingenuity, and efforts of projectors, instrumental
in promoting designs of certain advantage to the
public, though of doubtful success with refpec to
oft. rll themselves. One of the firlt propositions of this

i kind was made by Alonfo de Ojeda, a gallant and

antive officer, who had accompanied Columbus in
his second voyage. Ilis rank and characer pro-
cured him fucl credit with the merchants of Se-
ville, that they undertook to equip four flips,
provided he could obtain the royal licence, autlio-
riling the voyage. The powerful patronage of the

bilhop

bilhop of Badajos easily secured success in a suit so B 0 o K
agreeable to the court. Without consulting Co-
lumbus, or regarding the rights and jurisdiction '499
which he had acquired by the capitulation in one
thousand four hundred and ninety-two, Ojeda was
permitted to set out for the New World. In order
to direct his course, the bishop communicated to
him the admiral's journal of his last voyage, and
his charts of the countries which he had dif-
covered. Ojeda struck out into no new path of May.
navigation, but adhering servilely to the route
which Columbus had taken, arrived on the coast
of Paria. He traded with the natives, and stand-
ing to the welt, proceeded as far as Cape de Vela,
and ranged along a considerable extent of coast
beyond that on which Columbus had touched.
Having thus ascertained the opinion of Columbus,
that this country was a part of the continent,
Ojeda returned by way of Hispaniola to Spain, Ohlobr.
with some reputation as a discoverer, but with
little benefit to those who had raised the funds for
the expedition b.

AMERIGO VESPUCCI, a Florentine gentleman, I.cccmpo-

accompanied Ojeda in this voyage. In what fta- ,id o
tion he served, is uncertain; but as he was an ex- v'i~U,'
perienced sailor, and eminently skilful in all the
sciences fubfcrvient to navigation, he seems to have

B o OK acquired such authority among his companions,
- . _, that they willingly allowed him to have a chief

349*. fharc in direeing their operations during the

voyage. Soon after his return, he transmitted an
account of his adventures and discoveries to one
of his countrymen; and labouring with the vanity
of a traveller to magnify his own exploits, he had
the address and confidence to frame his narrative,
so as to make it appear that he had the glory of
having firfl discovered the continent in the New
World. Amerigo's account was drawn up not
only with art, but with iome elegance. It con-
tained an amusing hiflory of his voyage, and! ju.
dicious oblcrvations upon the natural productions,
the inhabitants, and the customs of the countries
which he had visited. As it was the first defcrip-
tion of any part of the New World that was pub-
lifhed, a performance so well calculated to gratify
the paflion of mankind for what is new and mar-
vellous, circulated rapidly, and was read with ad-

Fromwvlom 1niration. The country of which Amerigo was
ihmhe0 ,.ni fipljolt'd to be the discoverer, came gradually to
ivcnlioi,,f b called by his namen. The caprice of mankind,
New Wrlld.

often as unaccountable as uijult, has perpetuated
this error. By the univcrfal conltent of nations,
AMERICA is the name bellowed on this new quar-
ter of the globe. The bold pretcnfions of a for-
tunate illll)plor have robbed the diiioverer of the
New Woi ld of a dilliiicio which belonged to him.
The name of Amerigo has fiupplanted that of Co-

lumbus;

lumbus; and mankind may regret an a&t of injuf- B o o K
tice, which, having received the fanaion of time,
it is now too late to redress '. 499.

DURING the fame year, another voyage of dif- voyagr of

covery was undertaken. Columbus not only in- Nigno.
troduced the spirit of naval enterprise into Spain,
but all the first adventurers who diflinguifhed them-
selves in this new career, were formed by his in-
ftrutions, and acquired in his voyages the skill and
information which qualified them to imitate his
example. Alonfo Nigno, who had served under
the admiral in his lait expedition, fitled out a single
ship, in conjuntion w.ith Christopher Guerra, a mer-
chant of Seville, and failed to the coast of Paria.
This voyage seems to have been condu&ed with
greater attention to private emolument, than to
any general or national objedt. Nigno and Guerra
made no discoverics of any importance; but they
brought home filch a return of gold and pearls, as
inflamed their countrymen with the desire of en-
gaging in finilar adventures d.

which Pinzon had ftopt ihort, was more fully dil-
covered. The fucccfsful voyage of Gama to the
East Indics having encouraged the king of Por-
tugal to fit out a fleet so powerful, as not only to
carry on trade, but to attempt conquest, lie gave
the command of it to Pedro Alvarez Cabral. In
order to avoid the coast of Africa, where he was
certain of meeting with variable breezes, or fre-
luent calms, which might retard his voyage,
Cabral flood out to sea, and kept so far to the welt,
that, to his surprise, he found himfclf upon the Ihore
of an unknown country, in the tenth degree be-
yond the line. He imagined, at sirs, that it was
tome island in tie Atlantic ocean, hitherto unob-
served; but, proceeding along its coast for several
days, he was led gradually to believe, that a coun-
try o cextenfive formed a part of some great conti-
nent. This latter opinion was well founded. The
country with which lie fell in belongs to that pro-

high idea of the fertility of the foil, and agreeable- 1S"°
ness of the climate, he took poelefion of it for the
crown of Portugal, and dispatched a ship to Liibon
with an account of this event, which appeared to be
no less important than it was unexpeced f. Colum-
bus's discovery of the New World was the effort
of an active genius, enlightened by science, guided
by experience, and afting upon a regular plan,
executed with no less courage than perseverance.
But from this adventure of the Portuguese, it ap-
pears that chance might have accomplished that
great design which it is now the pride of human
reason to have formed and perfesld. If the saga-
city of Columbus had not conduted mankind to
America, Cabral, by a fortunate accident, might
have led them, a few years later, to the knowledge
of that extensive continent .

the union and weakened the force of the mutineers,
it did not extirpate the feeds of discord out of the
ifjand. Several of the malcontents continued in
arms, refusing to submit to the admiral. He and
his brothers were obliged to take the field alter-
nately, in order to check their incursions, or to
punish their crimes. The perpetual occupation
and difqiuiet which this created, prevented him from
giving due attention to the dangerous machinations
of his enemies in the court of Spain. A good
number of such as were most dissatisfied with his
administration, had embraced the opportunity of
returning to Europe with the ships which he dif-
patched from St. Domingo. Tlle final disappoint-
ment of all their hopes inflamed the rage of theft
unfortunate adventurers against Columbus to tile
utmofl pitch. Their poverty and diflrefs, by ex-
citing compaflion, rendered their accusations cre-
dible, and their complaints interefllig. They teazed
Ferdinand and Ifabclla incelf.ntly with memorials,
containing the detail of thcir own grievances, and
the articles of their charge against Columbus.

ever they met them, reproaching them as the -
offspring of the projector, whose fatal curiosity had '5'
discovered those pernicious regions which drained
Spa;r, of its wealth, and would prove the grave of
its people. These avowed endeavours of the mal-
contents from America to ruin Columbus, were

pence of the armaments fitted out. The glory of
the discovery, together with the profpe& of re-
mote commercial advantages, was all that Spain
had yet received in return for the efforts which she
had made. But time had already diminished the

« v- dered Spain, on this account, as having loft by the

500°' enterprise of Columbus, and imputed it to his mif-

conduct and incapacity for government, that a
country abounding in gold had yielded nothing of
value to its conquerors. Even Isabella, who from
the favourable opinion which fle entertained of
Columbus, had uniformly protected him, was fha-
ken at length by the number and boldness of his ac-
cufers, and began to lffpect that a difaffcion so
general must liave been occasioned by real grie-
vances, which called for redress. The bishop of
Badajos, with his usual animosity againIt Columbus,
encouraged these suspicions, and conlirmed them.

Farl effctas As soon as the queen began to give way to the
ejt' this.

hi torrent of calumny, a resolution fatal to Columbus

was taken. Francis de Bovadilla, a knight of Ca-
latrava, was appointed to repair to Hispaniola, with
fill powers to enquire into the conduct of Colum-
bus, and, if he should find the charge of mal-admi-
niftration proved, to supersede him, and affime the
government of the ifand. It was impoflible to
escape condemnation, when this preposterous com-
minion made it the interell of the judge to pro-
nounce the person whom he was sent to try, guilty.
Though Columbus had now composed all the dif-
fenfions in the island; though he had brought both
Spaniards and Indians to submit peaceably to his
government; though he had made fuich effectual

provision

provision for working the mines, and cultivating B °°

o

the country, as would have secured a considerable - _r
revenue to the king, as well as large profits to in- '
dividuals, Bovadilla, without deigning to attend to
the nature or merit of those services, discovered,
from the moment that he landed in Hispaniola, a
determined purpose of treating him as a criminal.
He took pofeflion of the admiral's house in St.
Domingo, from which its master happened at that
time to be absent, and seized his effects, as if his
guilt had been already fully proved; he rendered
himself master of the fort and of the king's stores
by violence; he required all persons to acknow-
ledge him as supreme governor; he set at liberty
the prisoners confined by the admiral, and fum-
moned him to appear before his tribunal, in order
to answer for his conduct; tranfinitting to him, to-.
gether with the summons, a copy of the royal
mandate, by which Columbus was enjoined to
yield implicit obedience to his commands.

COLUMBUs, though deeply affected with the in- Culumbus

gratitude and injustice of Ferdinand and Ifabella,.chainsto
did not hesitate a moment about his own conduct. spi,.b
He submitted to the will of his fovcreigns with a
refpetful silence, and repaired diredly to the
court of that violent and partial judge whom they
had authorized to try him. Bovadilla, without
admitting him into his presence, ordered him in-
iantly to be arrclted, to be loaded with chains,

o 3 aind

a OO K and hurried on board a ship. Even under this hu.
. . ._ miliating reverse of fortune, the firmness of mind
's5' which diflinguihes the charaEter of Columbus, did

not forsake him. Conscious of his own integrity,
and solacing himself with reflecing upon the great
things which he had atchieved, he endured this
infuit offered to his character, not only with com-
pofure, but with dignity. Nor had he the confola-
tion of sympathy to mitigate his sufferings. Bova-
dilla had already rendered himself so extremely
popular, by granting various immunities to the
colony, by liberal donations of Indians to all who
applied for them, and by relaxing the reins ofdif-
cipline and government, that the Spaniards, who
were mostly adventurers, whom their indigence
or crimes had impelled to abandon their native
country, exprelied the most indecent fatisfation
with the disgrace and imprisonment of Columbus.
They flattered themselves, that now they Ihould
enjoy an uncontrouled liberty, more suitable to
their disposition and former habits of life. Among
persons thus prepared to censure the proceedings,
and to asperse the characer of Columbus, Bova-
dilla collceted materials for a charge against him.
All accusations, the most improbable, as well as
inconiftent, were received. No informer, how-
ever infimous, was rejected. The result of this
inqucft, no less indecent than partial, he transmit-
ted to Spain. At the fame time, lie ordered Co-
lumbus, with his two brothers, to be carried thi-

ther

ther in fetters; and, adding cruelty to insult, he B o o k
confined them in different Ihips, and excluded .l "
them from the comfort of that friendly intercourfie i's^
which might have soothe' their common diftrefi.
put while the Spaniards in Hispaniola viewed the
arbitrary and insolent proceedings of Bovadilla
with a general approbation, which reflects dif-
honour upon their name and country, one man (till
retained a proper sense of the great actions which
Columbus had performed, and was touched with
the sentiments of veneration and pity due to his
rank, his age, and his merit. Alonfo de Valleje,
the captain of the vefel on board which the ad-
miral was confined, as soon as he was clear of the
island, approached his prisoner with great refpeet,
and offered to release him from the fetters with
which he was unjutfly loaded. If No," replied
Columbus, with a generous indignation, "I weat
there irons in consequence of an order from my
sovereigns. They shall find me as obedient to this
as to their other injunctions. By their command I
have been confined, and their command alone fliall
set me at liberty '."

«.-y»- what universal astonishment this event must occa-

it muff make. All Europe, they foresaw, would
be filled with indignation at this ungenerous re-
quital of a man who had performed acions worthy
of the highest recompence, and would exclaim
against the injustice of the nation, to which he had
been such an eminent benefacor, as well as against
the ingratitude of the princes whose reign he had
rendered illustrious. Aflamed of their own con-
duct, and eager not only to make some reparation
for this injury, but to efface the stain which it
might fix upon their chara&er, they inRfantly issued
pec. 7. orders to set Columbus at liberty, invited him to

court, and remitted money to enable him to appear
there in a manner suitable to his rank. When he
entered'the royal presence, Columbus threw him-
self at the feet of his sovereigns. He remained
for some time silent; the various paflions which
agitated his mind suppressing his power of utter-
ance. At length he recovered himielt; and vin-
dicated his conduc in a long tdifcourfe, producing
the most satisfying proofs of his own integrity,
as well as good intention, and evidence, no less
clear, of the malevolence of his caemies, who,
not satisfied with having ruined his fortune, labour-
ed to deprive him of what alone was now left, his
honour and his fame. Ferdinand received him
with decent civility, and liabella with tenderness

ings, they did not rfRtore to Columbus his jurif-
didion and privileges as viceroy of those countries
which lie had dilcovered. Though willing to ap-
pear the avengers of Columbus's wrongs, that
illiberal jealouly which prompted them to invest
Bovadilla with such authority as put it in his
power to treat the admiral with indignity still sub-
sifted. They were afraid to trust a man to whom
they had been so highly indebted, and retaining
him at court under various pretexts; they appointed
Nicholas de Ovando, a knight of the military or-

COLUMnUS was deeply affected with this new

injury, which came from hands that seemed to be
employed in making reparation for his pail susser-

every thing that implies any suspicion of their in-
tegrity, or that wears the afpeft of an affront, is
exquisite. Columbus had experienced both from

BEFORE these adventurers returned from their Ovandoap-

pointed go-

voyages, a fleet was equipped, at the public ex- vrnnor of
pence, for carrying over Ovando, the new go- Hiaio,
vernor, to Hispaniola. His presence there was
extremely requisite, in order to tfop the inconfi-
derate career of Bovadilla, whose imprudent ad-
ministration threatened the settlement with ruin.
Conscious of the violence and iniquity of his pro.
ceedings against Columbus, he continued to make
it his sole objec to gain the favour and support of
his countrymen, by accommodating himself to
their paflions and prejudices. With this view, he
cltablifhed regulations, in every point the reverse
of those which Columbus deemed essential to the
prosperity of the colony. Intead of the severe dif-
cipline, necessary in order to habituate the dissolute
and corrupted members of which the society was
compoied, to the rnftraints of law and fubordina-
tion, he suffered them to enjoy filch uncontrouled
licence, as encouraged the wildest excesses. In-
stead of protecing the Indians, he gave a legal

s15. of the Spaniards was too rapacious and impatient to

try any method of acquiring wealth but that of
Searching for gold, this servitude became as grie-
vous as it was unjust. The Indians were driven
in crowds to the mountains, and compelled to
work in the mines by mailers, who imposed their
talks without mercy or discretion. Labour, so dif-
proportioned to their flrength and former habits
of life, wafted that feeble race of men with such
rapid consumption, as muff have soon terminated
in the utter extincion of the ancient inhabitants of

proclamation was issued, declaring the natives to ^

to be exaced contrary to their own inclination,
and without paying them an adequate price for
their labour. With respect to the Spaniards them-
selves, various regulations were made, tending to
suppress the licentious spirit which had been so
fatal to the colony, and to eftablilh that reverence
for law and order on which society is founded, and
to which it is indebted for its increase and liability.
In order to limit the exorbitant gain which private
persons were supposed to make by working the
mines, an ordinance was published, directing all the
gold to be brought to a public finelting-houfc, and
declaring one half of it to be the property of the

s50o. The greatness of his discoveries, and the profpe&t

of their increasing value, made Ferdinand confider
the conceflions in the capitulation as extravagant
and impolitic. He was afraid of entrusting a sub.
je& with the exercise ofa jurifdiion that now ap.
peared to be so extremely extensive, and might
grow to be no lets formidable. He inspired Ifa.
bella with the fame fifpicions; and under various
pretexts equally frivolous and unjust, they eluded
all Columbus's requisitions to perform that which
a solemn compact bound them to accompliih.
After attending the court of Spain for near two
years, as an humble suitor, he found it impolible
to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehen-
sions; and perceived, at length, that he laboured in
vain, when he urged a claim of juflice or merit
with an interested and unfeeling prince.

le forms BUT even this ungenerous return did not difcou-
ichemes of rage him from pursuing the great object which sirs
ffcovry. called forth his inventive genius, and excited him

to attempt discovery. To open a new passage to
the East Indies was his original and favourite
scheme. This still engrossed his thoughts; and
cither from his own observations in his voyage to
Paia, or from some obscure hint of the natives, or
from the accounts given by Baftidas and de la
Cosa, of their expedition, he conceived an opinion

that,

that, beyond the continent of America, there was B o o K
a lea which extended to the Ealf Indies, and hoped . "
to find some itrait or narrow neck of land, by 's'"
which a communication might be opened with it
and the part of the ocean already known. By a
very fortunate conjeture, he fluppofed this firait or
ithmus to be situated near the gulf of Darien.
Full of this idea, though he was now of an ad-
vanced age, worn out with fatigue, and broken
with infirmities, he offered, witld the alacrity of a
youthful adventurer, to undertake a voyage which
would ascertain this important point, and pcrfecc
the grand scheme which from the beginning he
proposed to accomplifl. Several circulltances
concurred in dilpofing Ferdinand and Ifibella to
lend a favourable ear to this proposal. They were
glad to have the pretext of any honourable em-
ployment for removing from court a man with
whose demands they deemed it impolitic to com-
ply, and whose services it was indecent to neglct.
Though unwilling to reward Columbus, they were
not insensible of his merit, and from their expe-
perience of his skill and condu&, had reason to give
credit to his conjectures, and to confide in his fuc-
cess. To these considerations, a third must be
added of till more powerful influence. About this
time the Portuguefi fleet, under Cabral,arrivcd from
the Indies; and, by the richness. of its cargo, gave
the people of Europe a more perfect idea than they
had hithcrto beei able to form, of the opulence and

fertility

B 0 0 K fertility of the east. The Portuguese had been

- _-. more fortunate in their difcdveries than the Spa-
1502. niards. They had opened a communication with

countries where industry, arts, and elegance flou-
rifhed; and where commerce had been longer efta-
blifhed; and carried to greater extent, than in any
region of the earth. Their firfi voyages thither
yielded immediate as well as vast returns of profit,
in commodities extremely precious and in great
request. Lisbon became immediately the feat of
commerce and wealth; while Spain had only the
expectation of remote benefit, and of future gain,
from the western world. Nothing, then, could be
more acceptable to the Spaniards than Columbus's
offer to condua them to the east, by a route which
he expeted to be fforteir as well as leis danger-
ous, than that which the Portuguese had taken.
Even Ferdinand was routed by such a profpet,
and warmly approved of the undertaking.

His foulth BUT interesting as the object of this voyage was
vOYsie. to the nation, Columbus could procure only four

fiall barks, the largest of which did not exceed
seventy tons in burden, for performing it. Ac-
customed to brave danger, and to engage in arduous
undertakings with inadequate force, he did not he-
fitate to accept the command of this pitiful fqua-
dron. His brother Bartholomew, and his second
son Ferdinand, the historian of his ations, accom-
panied him. He failed from Cadiz on the ninth

of

of May, and touched, as usual, at the Canary islands; B 0 K
from thence he proposed to have stood dire&ly
for the continent; but his largest 'reffel was bo '5c.
clumsy and unfit for service, as constrained him to
bear away for Hispaniola, in hopes of exchanging
her for some ihip of the fleet that had carried out
Ovando. When he arrived at St. Domingo, he June ,
found eighteen of these flips ready loaded, and on
the point of departing for Spain. Columbus im-
mediately acquainted the governor with the defti-
nation of his voyage, and the accident which had
obliged him to alter his route. He requested per-
million to enter the harbour, not only that he
might negociate the exchange of his ship, but
that he might take lhelter during a violent hur-
ricane, of which he dilcerned the approach from
various prognostics, which his experience and fa-
gacity had taught him to observe. On that ac-
count, he advised him likewise to put off for some
days the departure of the fleet bound for Spain.
But Ovando refused his requell, and derpifed his
counseL Under circumflances in which humanity
would have afforded refuge to a tranger, Colum-
bus was denied admittance into a country of which
he had discovered the exiflence and acquired
the pofflefion. His salutary warning, which me-
rited the greatest attention, was regarded as the
dream of a visionary prophet, who arrogantly pre-
tended to predit an event beyond the reach of
human foresight. The fleet set fail for Spain.

VOL. I. p Next

B o o K Next night the hurricane came on with dreadsid
Ir.4 impetuosity. Columbus, aware of the danger,
Iscz. took precautions against it, and saved his little

squadron. The fleet destined for Spain met with
the fate which the rashness and obstinacy of its
commanders deserved. Of eighteen ships two or
three only escaped. In this general wreck pe-
rifhed Bovadilla, Roldan, and the greater part of
those who had been the most active in persecuting
Columbus, and oppressing the Indians. Together
with themselves, all the wealth which they had
acquired by their injustice and cruelty was fwal-
lowed up. It exceeded in value two hundred
thouiand pesos; an immense fum at that period,
and liufficient not only to have screened them from
any fcvere scrutiny into their conduct, but to have
lecured them a gracious reception in the Spanish
court. Among the Ihips that escaped, one had on
board all the effects of Columbus which had been
recovered from the ruins of his fortune. Hifto-
rians, firuck with the exaCt discrimination of cha-
ratcrs, as well as the just distribution of rewards
and punishments, conspicuous in those events, uni-
verfally attribute them to an immediate interpo-
fition of divine Providence, in order to avenge the
wrongs of an injured man, and to punish the op-
)lellors of an innocent people. Upon the igno-
rant and fuperflitious race of men, who were wit-
nciflis of this occurrence, it made a different im-
preflion. From an opinion which vulgar admi-

appeared to be a people more civilized, and who
had made greater progress in the knowledge of
useful arts, than any whom he had hitherto dif-
covered. In return to the inquiries which the
Spaniards made, with their usual eagernes, con-
cerning the places where the Indians got the gold
which they wore by way of ornament, they di-
re&ed them to countries situated to the weft, in
which gold was found in such profusion, that it
was applied to the most common uses. Instead of

on shore several times, and advanced into the
country, he did not penetrate so far as to cross the
narrow isthmus which separates the gulf of Mexico
from the great southern ocean. He was so much
delighted, however, with the fertility of the coun-
try, and conceived such an idea of its wealth, from
the specimens of gold produced by the natives,
that he resolved to leave a small colony upon the

But the ungovernable spirit of the people under his
command, deprived Columbus of the glory ofplant-
ing the first colony on the continent of America.
Their intolence and rapaciousness provoked the
natives to take arms, and as these were a more
hardy and warlike race of men than the inhabitants

the only misfortune that besel Columbus; it was ""lca
followed by a lilcceiflon of all the disasters to which
navigation is exposed. Furious hurricanes, with
violent storms of thunder and lightning, threat-
ened his leaky vessels with deflruction; while his
discontented crew, exhausted with fatigue, and defti-
tute of provisions, was unwilling or unable to exe-
cute his commands. One of his ships perished;
he was obliged to abandon another, as unfit for
service; and with the two which remained, he
quitted that part of the continent which in his an-
guilh he named the Coast of Vexation i, and bore
away for Hitpaniola. New difIreffes awaited him

count of his situation to Hispaniola, appeared im-
practicable; and without this it was vain to expec
relief. His genius, fertile in resources, and most
vigorous in those perilous extremities when feeble
minds abandon themselves to despair, discovered
the only expedient which afforded any profpeft of
deliverance. He had recourse to the hospitable
kindness of the natives, who confidering the Spa.
niards as beings of a superior nature, were eager,
on every occasion, to minister to their wants. From
them he obtained two of their canoes, each formed
out of the trunk of a tingle tree hollowed with fire,
and so mis-shapen and aukward as hardly to merit
the name of boats. In these, which were fit only
for creeping along the coast, or crossing from one
fide of a bay to another, Mendez, a Spaniard, and
Fiefchi, a Genoese, two gentlemen particularly at-
tached to Columbus, gallantly offered to set out
for Ilifpaniola, upon a voyage of above thirty
leagues'. This they accomplished in ten days,
after surmounting incredible dangers, and enduring
such fatigues, that several of the Indians who ac-
companied them funk under it, and died. The
attention paid to them by the governor of Hifpa-
niola was neither such as their courage merited,

nor

nor the diitrefs of the persons from whom they B 0O K
came required. Ovando, from a mean jealousy of 1
Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to set foot s"53.
in the island under his government. This ungene-
rous pasion hardened his heart against every tender
sentiment, which refletion upon the services and
misfortunes of that great man, or companlion for
his own fellow-citizens involved in the fame cala-
mities, must have excited. Mendez and Fiefchi
spent eight months in soliciting relief for their
commander and associates, without any profpet
of obtaining it.

DURING this period, various paflions agitated Hi difref

verfity. At first the expetation of speedy deliver-
ance, from the success of Mendez and Fiefchi's
voyage, cheered the spirits of the most desponding.
After some time the more timorous began to
fufpea that they had miscarried in their daring at-
tempt. At length, even the molt sanguine con- ,o54.
cluded that they had perilbed. The ray of hope
which had broke in upon them, made their condi-
tion appear now more dismal. Despair, heightened
by disappointment, fettled in every breafi. Their
last resource had failed, and nothing remained but
the profpea of ending their miserable days among
naked savages, far from their country and their
friends. The seamen, in a transport of rage, rote

P. 4 whom

B 0 0 K whom they reproached as the author of all their
.--v-- calamities, seized ten canoes, which he had pur-
5i04. chased from the Indians, and despising his remon-

itrances and entreaties, made off with them to a
distant part of the island. At the fame time the
natives murmured at the long refilence of the Spa-
niards in their country. As their industry was not
greater than that of their neighbours in I-ifpaniola,
like them they found the burden of supporting so
many strangers to be altogether intolerable. They
began to bring in provisions with reluctance, they
furnished them with a sparing hand, and threatened
to withdraw those supplies altogether. Such a re-
solution rhuft have been quickly fatal to the Spa-
niards. Their safety depended upon the good-
will of the Indians; and unless they could revive
the admiration and reverence with which that fim-
pie people had at firfl beheld them, defltrultion was
unavoidable. Though the licentious proceedings
of the mutineers had, in a great measure, es-
faced those impreflions which had been tb fa-
vourable to the Spaniards, the ingenuity of Co-
lumbus fuggcetcd a happy artifice, that not only
restored but heightened the high opinion which the
Indians had originally entertained of them. By

who dwells in heaven, who made and governs the
world; that he, offended at their refuting to support
men who were the objects of his peculiar favour,
was preparing to punish this crime with exemplary
severity, and that very night the moon should
withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue, as
a sign of the divine wrath, and an emblem of the
vengeance ready to fall upon them. To this mar-
vellous prediction tome of them listened with the
careless indifference peculiar to the people of Ame-
rica; others, with the credulous astonishment na-
tural to barbarians. But when the moon began
gradually to be darkencd, and at length appeared
of a red colour, all were ltruck with terror. They
ran with confern.ation to their houfles, and return-
ing instantly to Coliimbus loaded with provisions,
threw them at his feet, conjuring him to intercede
with the Great Spirit to avert the dellruction with
which they were threatened. Columbus, seeming
to be moved by their entreaties, promised to com-
ply with tleir delire. The eclipse went off, the
moon recovered its splendour, and from that day
the Spaniards were not only furniflled profusely
with provisions, but the natives, with superstitious
attention, avoided every thing that could give them
oflnce '.

DURINo

r o o K DURING those tranfaftions, the mutineers had
_--_ made repeated attempts to pass over to Hispaniola
,c50?4 in the canoes which they had seized. But, from
dition to their own mifcondu6, or the violence of the winds

and currents, their efforts were all unsuccessful.
Enraged at this disappointment, they marched to-
wards that part of the island where Columbus re-
mained, threatening him with new insults and dan-
ger. While they were advancing, an event hap-
pened, more cruel and affliting than any calamity
which he dreaded from them. The governor of
Hispaniola, whole mind was still filled with tome
dark suspicions of Columbus, sent a small bark to
Jamaica, not to deliver his distressed countrymen,
but to spy out their condition. Left the sympathy
of those whom he employed ihould afford them re-
lief, contrary to his intention, he gave the com-
mand of this vessel to Efcobar, an inveterate ene-
my of Columbus, who adhering to his inftrutions
with malignant accuracy, cast anchor at ofme
diffance from the island, approached the fllore in a
small boat, observed the wretched plight of the
Spaniards, delivered a letter of empty compliments
to the admiral, received his answer, and departed.
When the Spaniards first descried the vessel ifand-
ing towards the island, every heart exulted, as if
the long-expeted hour of their deliverance had at
length arrived; but when it disappeared so ftd-
denly, they funk into the deepest dejedion, and
all their hopes died away. Columbus alone, though
he felt mofl sensibly this wanton insult which Ovando

added

added to his past negle&, retained such composure B O K
of mind, as to be able to cheer his followers. He -
assured them, that Mendez and Fiefchi had reached '5s"
Ilifpaniola in safety; that they would speedily pro-
cure ships to carry them off; but as Eficobar's
vessel could not take them all on board, that he
had refused to go with her, because he was deter-
mined never to abandon the faithful companions of
his distress. Soothed with the expetation offpeedy
deliverance, and delighted with his apparent gene-
rofity in attending more to their preservation than
to his own fafcty, their spirits revived, and he
regained their confidence ".

WITHOUT this confidence, he could not have

refilled the mutineers, who were now at hand. All
his endeavours to reclaim those desperate men had
no effect but to increase their frenzy. Their de-
mands became every day more extravagant, and
their intentions more violent and bloody. The
common safety rendered it necessary to oppole
them with open force. Columbus, who had been
long affliced with the gout, could not take the
field. His brother, the adelantado, marched May zo.
against them. They quickly met. The muti-
neers rejected with scorn terms of accommodation,
which were once more offered them, and rulhed
on boldly to the attack. They fell not upon an

this, the relt fled with a dastardly fear, suitable to

hopclefs. In this, however, was Columbus doomed
to employ the close of his days. As soon as his

THE
HISTORY

OF
AME R I C A.

B O O K Il.
W HILE Columbus was employed in his lafi B o o K

voyage, several events worthy of notice

happened in Hispaniola. The colony there, the St t\of th
parent and nurse of all the subsequent eftabliflments co:n^y i
of Spain in the New World, gradually acquired the
form of a regular and prosperous society. The
humane solicitude of Isabella to protect the Indians
from oppreflion, and particularly the proclamation,
by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel
them to work, retarded, it is true, for some time,
the progress of improvement. The natives, who
confidered exemption from toil as supreme felicity,
scorned every allurement and reward by which
they were invited to labour. The Spaniards had
not a sufficient number of hands either to work the
mines or to cultivate the foil. Several of the first
colonists, who had been accustomed to the service

4 of

B o o K of the Indians, quitted the island, when deprived
-^ of those inltruments, without which they knew not
'504. how to carry on any operation. Many of the new

settlers who came over with Ovando, were seized
with the diltempers peculiar to the climate, and in
a short fpacc above a thousand of them died. At
the fame time, the exacing one half of the produfe
of the mines as the royal flare, was found to be a
demand so exorbitant, that no adventurers would
engage to work them upon such terms. In order
to save the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to
°o55. relax the rigour of the royal edicts. He made a

new distribution of the Indians among the Spaniards,
and compelled them to labour, for a ttated time,
in digging the mines, or in cultivating the ground;
but, in order to screen himself from the imputation
of having fubjeted them again to servitude, he en-
joined their maeftrs to pay them a certain fum, as
the price of their work. He reduced the royal
share of the gold found in the mines from the half
to the third part, and soon after lowered it to a
fifth, at which it long remained. Notwithifanding
Isabella's tender concern for the good treatment of
the Indians, and Ferdinand's eagerness to improve
the royal revenue, Ovando persuaded the court to
approve of both theic regulations'.

thendians,. oppreflion, though during a Ihort interval, now

felt the yoke of bondage to be Co galling, that they B o 0 K
made several attempts to vindicate their own li.- a
berty. This the Spaniards confidered as rebellion, 5sos.
and took arms in order to reduce them to subjec-
tion. When war is carried on between nations
whose state of improvement is in any degree fimi-
lar, the means of defence bear some proportion to
chose employed in the attack; and in this equal
contef such efforts must be made, such talents are
displayed) and such paflions rouscd, as exhibit
mankind to view in a situation no less striking than
interesting. It is one of the noblest functions of
history, to observe and to delineate men at a junc-
ture when their minds are most violently agitated,
and all their powers and passions are called forth.
Hence the operations of war, and the struggles
between contending states, have been deemed by
historians, ancient as well as modern, a capital and
important article in the annals of human acions.
But in a contest between naked savages, and one of
the most warlike of the European nations, where
science, courage, and discipline on one fide, were op-
posed by ignorance, timidity, and disorder on the
other, a particular detail of events would be as un-
pleasant as uninftru&ive. If the simplicity and.inno.
cence of the Indians had inspired the Spaniards with
humanity, had softened the pride of superiority into
compaflion, and had induced them to improve the
inhabitants of the New World, instead of oppref-

' ^ too rigorous chastisements of impatient inftrutors,
35C. might have been related without horror. But, un-

fortunately, this consciousness of superiority ope-
rated in a different manner. The Spaniards were
advanced so far beyond the natives of America in
improvement of every kind, that they viewed them
with contempt. Theyconceived the Americans to
be animals of an inferior nature, who were not in,
titled to the rights and privileges of men. In
peace, they fubjeted them to servitude. In war,
they paid no regard to those laws, which, by a tacit
convention between contending nations, regulate
hostility, and set some bounds to its rage. They
confidered them not as men fighting in defence of
their liberty, but as slaves, who had revolted againit
their maiters. Their caziques, when taken, were
condemned, like the leaders of banditti,' to the
most cruel and ignominious punishments; and all
their fubjets, without regarding the diRirinion of
ranks established among them, were reduced to the
fame itate of abjet slavery. Wi th fich a spirit
and tentiments were hostilities carried on ;against
the cazique of Higuey, a province -at the calem
extremity of the island. This war was ociaioned
by the perfidy- of the Spaniards, in violating a
treaty which they had made:with the natives;' and
it was terminated by hanging up :th caziqua ); hov

THE condu&t of Ovando, in afother part of:the Thecnel

and trea-
island, was still more treacherous and cruel, The' hrous

province anciently named Xaragua, which. extends O vdo.
from the fertile plain where Leogane is now situated,
to the western extremity of the island. was fubje&
to a female-cazique, named Anacoana. highly re-
fpcted by the natives. She, from that partial
fondness with which the women of America were
attached to the Europeans, (the cause of which
shall be afterwards explained,) had always courted
the friendship of the Spaniards, and loaded them
with benefits. But some of the adherents of Rol-
dan.having fettled in her country, were so much
exasperated at her endeavouring to restrain their
excesses, that they accused her of having formed a
plan to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate the
Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well what
little credit was due to such profligate menj
marched, without further inquiry,, towards Xara-
gua, with three hundred foot and seventy horse-
men. To prevent the Indians from taking alarm
at thia hotik appearance, he gave out that his sole
intention was to visit Anacoana, to.whom his
countrymen had been so muah indebted, in the
most rcfpeftul manner, and to regulate with her

150S' illustrious guest with due honour, aflembled the

principal men in her dominions, to the number of
three hundred, and advancing at the head of there,
accompanied by a great croud of persons of infe-
rior rank, she welcomed Ovando with songs and
dances, according to the mode of the country,
and conduted him to the place of her residence.
There he was feasted for some days, with all the
kindness of simple hofp.italiry, and amused with
the games and spectacles usual among the Americans
'upon occasions of mirth and festivity. But, amidst
the security which this inspired, Ovando was me.
ditating the deftru&ion of his unfufpicious enter-
tainer and her subje&s; and the mean perfidy with
which he executed this scheme, equalled his bar-
barity in forming it. Under colour of exhibiting
to the Indians the parade of an European tourna-
ment, he advanced with his troops, in battle array,
towards the hotlfe in which Anacoana and the chiefs
who attended her were affinbled. The infantry
took pofeftion of all the avenues which led to the
village. The horsemen encompalfed the houfc.
These movements were the object of admiration
without any mixture of fear, until, tpon a signal
which had been concerted, the Spaniards suddenly
drew their swords, and ruffed : upon the Indians;
defentelefs, and aftonifled at an at of treachery
which exceeded the conception of undesigning

men. In a moment Anacoana was recured. All B oa
her attendants were seized and bound. Fire was '
set to the house; and, without examination or con-
vi&ion, all these unhappy persons, the moR iflu.f
trious in their own country, were consumcd in the
flames. Anacoana was reserved for a more igno-
minious fate. She was carried in chains to St.
Domingo, and, after the formality of a trial before
Spanilh judges, she was condemned, upon the
evidence of those very men who had betrayed
her, to be publicly hanged '.

OVERAWED and humbled by this atrocious treat- Red',ion

ment of their princes and nobles, who were objets dians, and
of their highest reverence, the people in all the 'i" ffcal
provinces of Hispaniola submitted, without farther
refitance, to the Spanish yoke. Upon the death
of Isabella, all the regulations tending to mitigate
the rigour of their servitude were forgotten. The
small gratuity paid to them as the price of their
labour was withdrawn; and at the fame time the
tasks imposed upon them were increased. Ovando, s
without any restraint, distributed Indians among
his friends in the inand. Ferdinand, to whom the
queen had left by will one half of the revenue
arising from the settlements in the New World,
conferred grants of a similar nature upon his cour-

countrymen fettled in Hispaniola' and that wretched
people, being compelled to labour in order to
satisfy the rapacity of both, the exa&ions of their
0ppreflors no longer knew any bounds. But, bar-
barous as their policy was, and fatal to the inha-
bitants of Hispaniola, it produced, for some time,
very considerable effe&s, By calling forth the
force of a whole nation, and exerting it in one
direcion, the working of the mines was carried
on with amazing rapidity and success. During
several years, the gold brought into the royal
fmelting-houfes in Hispaniola amounted annually to
four hundred and sixty thousand pesos, above a
hundred thousand pounds sterling; which, if we
attend to the great change in the value of money
since the beginning of the sixteenth century to the
present times, must appear a considerable fum.
Vast fortunes were created, of a sudden, by some.
Others diflipated in ostentatious profusion, what
they acquired with facility. Dazzled by both, new
adventurers crowded to America, with the molt
eager impatience, to lhare in those treasures which
had enriched their countrymen; and, notwithltand-
ing the mortality occasioned by the unhealthiness
ps the climate, the colony continued to increase d.

OVANDO

OVANDO governed the Spaniards with.wifdom B o o I

and justice, not inferior to the rigour with which .
he treated the Indians. He eftablilhed equal laws, Ps,
and, by executing them with impartiality, ac- th'eCony
customed the people of the colony to reverenc
them. He founded several new towns in differert
parts of the island, and allured inhabitants to them,
by the concession of various immunities. He en-
deavoured to turn the attention of the Spaniards to
tome branch of indufry more useful than that of
searching for gold in the mines. Some flips of the
sugar-cane having been brought from.the Canary
ifands by way of experiment, they were found to
thrive with such increase in the rich foil and warm
climate to which they were transplanted, that the
cultivation of them soon became an objec of com-
merce. Extensive plantations were begun; fitgar.
works, which the Spaniards called ingtnio's, from
the various machinery employed in them, were
ereted, and in a few years the manufacture of this
commodity was the great occupation of the inha-
bitants of Hispaniola, and the most considerable
source of their wealth'.

THE prudent endeavours of Ovando, to promote Pol!ic4

the welfare of the colony, were powerfully seconded otr^di.

and welfare of the colony, a calamity impended Indaudi.
which threatened its dissolution. The original in- S"
habitants, on whole labour the Spaniards in Hifpa-

existence, wafted so fast, that the extin&ion of the
whole race seemed to be inevitable. When Colum-
bus discovered Hispaniola, the. number of its in-
habitants was computed to be at least a million'.
They were now reduced to sixty thouiand in the
space of' fifteen years. This consumption of the
human species, no lefi amazing than rapid, was the
effca of several concurring causes. The natives of
the American islands were of a more feeble confti-
tution than the inhabitants of the other hemisphere.
They could neither perform the fame work, nor
endure the fame fatigue, with men whose organs
were of a more vigorous conformation. The lilt-
kIes indolence in which they delighted to pass their

._ '- buted likewise to increase it, and rendered them, from
»So7. habit as well as contitution, incapable of hard la-

bour. The food on which they fibfifted afforded
little nourishment, and they were accustomed to
take it in small quantities, not sufficient to invigo-
rate a languid frame, and render it equal to the
efforts of active industry. The Spaniards, without
attending to those peculiarities in the conflitution
of the Americans, imposed talks upon them, which,
though not greater than Europeans might have per-
formed with cafe, were so disproportioned to their
strength, that many funk under the fatigue, and
ended their wretched days. Others, prompted by
impatience and despair, cut (hort their own lives
with a violent hand. Famine, brought on by
compelling such numbers to abandon the culture of
their lands, in order to labour in the mines, proved
fatal to many. Diseases of various kinds, some
occasioned by the hardships to which they were
exposed, and others by their intercourse with the
Europeans, who communicated to them some of
their peculiar maladies, completed the desolation
of the island. The Spaniards being thus deprived
of the instruments which they were accustomed to
employ, found it impofible to extend their im-
provements, or even to carry on the works which
Iscs. they had already begun. In order to provide an

immediate remedy for an evil so alarming, Ovando
proposed to transport the inhabitants of the Lucayo

islands

islands to Hispaniola, under pretence that they a 0 0 o
might be civilized with more facility, and in- ^ A-..
struted to greater advantage in the Christian re- lSO
ligion, if they were united to the Spanish colony,
and placed under the imnmediate infpe&ion of the
miillonaries setted there. Ferdinand, deceived
by this artifice, or willing to connive at an aa of
violence which policy represented as necessary,
gave his assent to the proposal. Several veflels
were fitted out for the Lucayos, the commanders
of which informed the natives, with whose language
they were now well acquainted, that they came from
a delicious country, in which the departed ancestors
of the Indians resided, by whom they were efnt to
invite their descendants to resort thither, to partake
of the blif enjoyed there by happy spirits. That
funple people listened with wonder and credulity;
and, fond of visiting their relations and friends in
that happy region, followed the Spaniards with
eagerness, By this artifice, above forty thouland
were decoyed into Hispaniola, to share in the sus-
ferings which were the lot of the inhabitants of that
island, and to mingle their groans and tears with
thole of that wretched race of men '.

B cs0 K have engroled heir whole attention. The Spirit

of discovery languiihed; and, since the lait voyage
1$1' of Columbus, no enterprize of any moment had

been undertaken. But as the decrease of the In.
dians rendered it impossible to acquire wealth in
that island with the fame rapidity as formerly, this
urged some of the more adventurous Spaniards to
search for new countries, where their avarice might
be gratified with more facility. Jwn Ponce de
Leon, who commanded under Ovando in the east-
em diftrit of Hispaniola, passed over to the island
of St. Juan de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had
discovered in his second voyage, and penetrated
into the interior part of the country. As he found
the. foil to be fertile, and expeted, from some
symptoms, as well as from the information of the
inhabitants, to discover mines of gold in the moun-
tains, Ovando permitted him to attempt making a
settlement in the island. This was easily effe&ed
by an officer eminent for conduct no less than for
courage. In a few years Puerto Rico wit;-fub-
jected to the Spanish government, the natives were
reduced to servitude; and, being treated with the
fame inconsiderate rigour as their neighbours in
Hispaniola, the race of-original inhabitants, worn
out with fatigue and fdfferings, was soon exter-
minated .

in this voyage, it deserves notice, because it led to
discoveries of greater importance. For the fame

I l_-. that, at the expence of being deemed unjust as
's5l well as ungrateful, he had wrested them from Co-

lumbus, it is not surprising that he should be un-
willing to confer them on his son. Accordingly,
Don Diego wafted two years in incessant but
fruitless importunity. Weary of this, he endea-
voured at length to obtain, by a legal sentence,
what he could not procure from the -favour of an
interested monarch. He commenced a suit against
Ferdinand before the council which managed In-
dian affairs, and that court, with integrity which
reflects honour upon its proceedings, decided
against the king, and sustained Don Diego's claim
of she viceroyalty, together with all the other
privileges stipulated in the capitulation. Evenr
aser this decree, Ferdinand's repugnance to put a
lubjed in poffeflion of such exrcnfive rights, might
have thrown in new obstacles, if Don Diego had
not taken a ftep which interested very powerful
perfors in the success of his claims. The ferntnce
of the council of the Indies gave him a title to a
rank so elevated, and a fortune so opulent, that he
found no difficulty in concluding a marriage with
Donna Maria, daughter of Don Ferdinand de
Toledo, great commendator of Leon, and brother
of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of the first
rank; and nearly related to the king. The duke
and his family efpoutld so warmly the caure of their

Columbus seemed now to enjoy the honours and

itfdf required new lustre by the accession of so

were found on its coast, that it did not long escape
the inquisitive avarice of the Spaniards, and be-
came a place of considerable retort. Large for-
tunes were acquired by the fishery of pearls, which
wvas carried on with extraordinary ardour. The
Indians, cfpecially those from the Lucayo islands,

find that the continent of America firetched on

ocean; They landed in different places, to take
poflflion in name of their sovereign; but though
the country appeared to be extremely fertile and
inviting, their force was so small, having been
fitted out rather for discovery than making fettle-

Their voyage served, however, to give the Spa-

now seriously attempted, and with eonfiderable

terprifing spirit of private adventurers. This
scheme took its rife from Alonfo de Qjeda, who

the money requisite to defray the charges of the
expedition. About the fame time, Diego de Ni-
cueffa, who had acquired a large fortune in Hifpa-
niola, formed a similar design. Ferdinand encou-
raged both; and though he refused to advance the
fimalleft fium, was extremely liberal of titles and
patents. He ereted two governments on the con-
tinent, one extending from Cape de Vela to the
gils of Darien, and the other from that to Cape
Gracias a Dios. The former was given to Ojeda,

' .~ not accomplihl by persuasion. The contemporary
0So9. writers enter into a very minute detail in relating

their tranfaftions; but as they made no discovery
of importance, nor established any permanent set-
tlement, their adventures are not entitled to any
considerable place in the general history of a pe.
riod, where romantic valour, firuggling with incre-
dible hardships, diftinguilh every effort of the Spa-
nifh arms. They found the natives in those coun-
tries of which they went to assume the government,
to be of a character very different from that of their
countrymen in the islands. They were fierce and
warlike. Their arrows were dipped in a poison so
noxious, that every wound was followed with cer-
tain death. In one encounter they flew above
seventy of Ojeda's followers, and the Spaniards, for
the first time, were taught to dread the inhabitants
of the New World. Nicueffa was opposed by
people equally resolute in defence of their pof.
sessions. Nothing could soften their ferocity.
Though the Spaniards employed every art to
soothe them, and to gain their confidence, they
refused to hold any intercourse, or to exchange any
friendly office, with men whose residence among
them they confidered as fatal to their liberty and
s5,o. independence. This implacable enmity of the na-

tives, though it rendered an attempt to eflablifl a
settlement in their country extremely difficult as
well as dangerous, might have been surmounted at

length

length by the perseverance of the Spaniards, by the B 0 OK
superiority of their arms, and their skill in the art
of war. But every disaster which can be accumu- '5'
lated upon the unfortunate, combined to complete
their ruin. The loss of their ships by various acci-
dents upon an unknown coast, the diseases peculiar
to a climate the most noxious in all America, the
want of provisions, unavoidable in a country im-
perfetly cultivated, dissension among themselves,
and the inceflant hostilities of the natives, involved
them in a fuccellion of calamities, the bare recital
of which strikes one with horror. Though they
received two considerable reinforcements from His-
paniola, the greater part of those who had engaged
in this unhappy expedition, perished, in iefs than a
year, in the most extreme misery. A few who
survived, fettled as a feeble colony at Santa Maria
el Antigua, on the gulf of Darien, under the com-
mand of Vafio Nugnez de Balboa, who, in the
most desperate exigencies, displayed such courage
and condu&, as tirft gained the confidence of his
countrymen, and marked him out as their leader in
more splendid and successful undertakings. Nor
was he the only adventurer in this expedition who
will appear with lustre in more important scenes.
Francisco Pizarro wa one of Ojeda's companions,
and in this school of adversity acquired or improved

acions which he afterwards performed. Hernan

tinAion. While this spirit continued warm and 1 O O
vigorous, every attempt either towards discovery or \.
conquest was applauded, and adventurers engaged t's
in it with emulation. The paflion for new under-
takings, which chara&erifes the age of discovery in
the latter part of the fifteenth and beginning of the
sixteenth century, would alone have been sufficient
to prevent the Spaniards from flopping lhort in
their career. But circumstances peculiar to His-
paniola at this juncture, concurred with it in ex-
tending their navigation and conquests. The ri-
gorous treatment of the inhabitants of that ifand
having almost extirpated the race, many of the
Spanilh planters, as I have already observed, find-
ing it impossible to carry on their works with the
fame vigour and profit, were obliged to look out
for settlements in some country where people were
not yet wafted by oppreflion. Others, with the
inconsiderate levity natural to men upon whom
wealth pours in with a sudden flow, had fquan-
dered in thoughtless prodigality, what they acquired
with cafe, and were driven by necessity to embark
in the most desperate schemes, in order to retrieve
their affairs. From all there causes, when Don
Diego Columbus proposed to conquer the ifand of isut;
Cuba, and to eftabliih a colony there, many persons
of chief diftintion in Hispaniola engaged with ala-
crity in the measure. He gave the command of
the troops destined for that service to Diego Velaf-
quez, one of his father's companions in his second

R. voyagec

o o K voyage, and who, having been long fettled in Hits
. ., paniola, had acquired an ample fortune, with such
'44I reputation for probity and prudence, that he leemed

to be well qualified for conducting an expedition of
importance. Three hundred men were deemed
sufficient for the conquest of an island of above
seven hundred miles in length, and filled with in-
habitants. But they were of the fame unwarlike
character with the people of Hispaniola. They
were not only intimidated by the appearance of
their new enemies, but unprepared to resist them.
For though, from the time that the Spaniards took
pofeflion of the adjacent island, there was reason to
expec' a descent on their territories, none of the
small communities into which Cuba was divided,
bad either made any provision for its own defence,
or had formed any concert for their common safety,
The only obstruction the Spaniards met with was
from Hatuey, a cazique, who had fled from Hifpa-
nliola, and had taken pofleflion of the eastern extre,
mity of Cuba. He stood upon the defensive at
their first landing, and endeavoured to drive them
back to their ships. His feeble troops, however,
were soon broken and dispersed; and he himself
being taken prisoner, Velasquez, according to the
barbarous maxim of the Spaniards, confidered him
as a slave who had taken arms against his master,
and condemned him to the flames. When Hatuey
was fastened to the stake, a Franciscan friar la-
bouring to convert him, promiscd him immediate

admittance

admittance into the joys of heaven, if he would B o Or
embrace the Christian faith. "Are there any Spa- ^
' niards," fays he, after some pause, " in that re- 5s4"
' gion of bliss which you describe?" "' Yes,"
replied the monk, " but only such as are worthy
" and good." " The belt of them," returned the
indignant cazique, " have neither worth nor good-
' ness; I will not go to a place where I may meet

with one of that accursed race ." This dread-

ful cxample of vengeance struck the people of
Cuba with. such terror, that they scarcely gave any
opposition to the progress of their invaders; and
Velasquez, without the loss of a man, annexed this
extensive and fertile island to the Spanilh mo-
narchy r.

THE facility with which this important conquest Dlrcov.y

was completed, fcrved as an incitement to others ,ortid
undertakings. Juan Ponce de Leon, having ac-
quired both fame and wealth by the reduction of
Puerto Rico, was impatient to engage in some new
enterprise, He fitted out three ships at his own 1s51.

tion foop dre v together a respectable body of fol-
lowers. He directed his course towards the Lu-
cayo islands; and after touching at several of them,
as well as of the Bahama isles, he flood to the

lie attempted to land in different places, but met
with such vigorous opposition from the natives, who
were fierce and warlike, as convinced him that an
increase of force was requisite to effet a Settlement.
Satisfied with having opened a communication with
a new country, of whose value and importance he
conceived very sanguine hopes, he returned to
Puerto Rico, through the channel now known by
die name of the Gulf of Florida.

IT was not merely the pafflon of searching for

new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to
undertake this voyage; he was influenced by one of
those visionary ideas, which at that time often
mingled with the spirit of discovery, and rendered
it more aCtive. A tradition prevailed among the
natives of Puerto Rico, that in the isle of Bimini,
one of the Lucayos, there was a fountain of such
wonderful virtue as to renew the youth, and recal
the vigour of every person who bathed in its falu-
tary waters. In hopes of finding this grand refo-
rative, Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged
through the islands, searching, with fruitless folici-
tude and labour, for the fountain, which was tie
chief objecR of their expedition. That a tale so
fabulous tliould gain credit among simple unin-

ftructetl

firucled Indians is not surprising. That it lhould B o o I
make any imprefllion upon an enlightened peo- _
pie appears, in the present age, altogether in- 's" -
credible. The fa&, however, is certain; and the
molt authentic Spanish historians mention this ex-
travagant sally of their credulous countrymen. The
Spaniards, at that period, were engaged in a career
of acivity which gave a romantic turn to their
imagination, and daily presented to them strange
and marvellous objects. A New World was opened
to their view. They visited islands and continents,
of whose existence mankind in former ages had no
conception. In those delightful countries nature
seemed to afiume another form: every tree and
plant and animal was different from those of the
ancient hemisphere. They seemed to be tranf-
ported into enchanted ground; and, after the won-
ders which they had seen, nothing, in the warmth
and novelty of their admiration, appeared to them
To extraordinary as to be beyond belief. If the ra-
pid succession of new and striking scenes made such
impreflion even upon the found understanding of
Columbus, that he boasted of having found the feat
of Paradise, it will not appear strange that Ponce
de Leon should dream of discovering the fountain
of youth '

L. . very of much greater importance was made in an-
proSrsof other part of America. Balboa having been raised
Balboa in to the government of the small colony at Santa

Maria in Darien, by the voluntary suffrage of his
associates, was so extremely desirous to obtain from
the crown a confirmation of their election, that he
dispatched one of his officers to Spain, in order to
lolicit a royal commilflon, which might invest him
with a legal title to the supreme command. Con-
icious, however, that he could not expe&t success
from the patronage of Ferdinand's ministers, with
whom he was unconneted, or from negociating in
a court to the arts of which he was a stranger, he
endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he
aspired, and aimed at performing rome signal ser-
vice that would secure him the preference to every
competitor. Full of this idea, he made frequent
inroads into the aijacent country, subdued several
of the caziques, and collected a considerable quan-
tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of
the continent than in the islands. In one of those
excursions, the Spaniards contended with such
cagernefs about the division of some gold, that
they were at the point of proceeding to ads of vio-
lence against one another. A young cazique, who
was present, aftonifled at the high value which
they let upon a thing of which he did not discern
the use, tumbled the gold out of the balance with
indignation; and, turning to the Spaniards, ,"Why

7 do

do you quarrel (fays he) about such a trifle ? If you Ba o K
are so paflionately fond of gold, as to abandon your i
own country, and to disturb the tranquillity of 'S'.
distant nations for its fake, I will condut you to
a region where the metal which seems to be the
chief object of your admiration and desire, is so
common that the meanest utensils are formed of
it." Transported with what they heard, Balboa
and his companions inquired eagerly where this
happy country lay, and how they might arrive at
it. He informed them that at the distance of fix
funs, that is of fix days journey towards the south,
they should discover another ocean, near to which
this wealthy kingdom was situated; but if they in-
tended to attack that powerful slate, they muff as-
femble forces far superior in number and strength
to those with which t!ey now appeared .

THIS was the sirs information which the Spa- The

niards received concerning the great southern til, h
ocean, or the opulent and extensive country known 0"'"'
afterwards by the name of Peru. Balboa had now
before him obje&s filited to his boundless ambition,
and the enterprising ardour of his genius. lHe im-
mediately concluded the ocean which the cazique
mentioned, to be that for which Columbus had
searched without success in this part of America, in
hopes of opening a more dire& communication

B o o K with the East Indies; and he conjectured that the
- -_ rich territory which had been described to him,
,sxz. must be part of that vast and opulent region of the

earth. Elated with the idea of performing what so
great a man had attempted in vain j and eager to
accomplish a discovery which he knew w6uld be no
less acceptable to the king than beneficial to his
country, he was impatient until he could set out
upon this enterprise, in comparison of which all
his former exploits appeared inconsiderable. But
previous arrangement and preparation were reqti-
site to ensure success. He began with courting and
securing the friend(hip of the neighbouring ca-
ziques. He sent some of his officers to Hifpa-
niola with a large quantity of gold, as a proof of
his pail: success, and an earned of his future hopes.
By a proper distribution of this, they secured the
favour of the governor, and allured volunteers into
the service. A considerable reinforcement from
that iflandjoined him, and he thought himself in
a condition to attempt the discovery.

Difficulty TIE iffhmus of Darien is not above sixty miles
,ng' XtU in breadth; but this neck of land, which binds to-

gether the continents of North and South Ame-
rica, is strengthened by a chain of lofty mountains
stretching through its whole extent,which render it a
barrier of solidity sufficient to resist the impuilfe of
two opposite oceans. The mountains are covered
with forests almost inaccessible. The valleys in that

moist

moist climate, where it rains during two-thirds of B O K
the year, are marihy, and so frequently overflowed, _
that the inhabitants find it necessary, in many places, ,s'"
to build their houses upon trees, in order to be ele-
vated at some distance from the damp foil, and the
odious reptiles engendered in the putrid waters .
Large rivers rulh down with an impetuous current
from the high grounds. In a region thinly inha-
bited by wandering savages, the hand of industry
had done nothing to mitigate or correct those natu-
ral disadvantages. To march across this unexplored
country, with no other guides but Indians, whose
fidelity could be little trufled, was, on all those ac'
counts, the boldef enterprise on which the Spa-
niards had hitherto ventured in the New World.
But the intrepidity of Balboa was such as diltin-
guifled him among his countrymen, at a period
when every adventurer was conspicuous for daring ;13.
courage. Nor was bravery his only merit; he was
prudent in conduct, generous, afifble, and pofflcfed
of those popular talents which, in the most defpe-
rate undertakings, inipire confidence and secure at-
tachment. Even after the jundion of the volun-
lunteers from Hispaniola, he was able to muster only
an hundred and ninety men tir his expedition. But
they were hardy veterans, inured to the climate of
America, and ready to follow him through every
danger. A thousand Indians attended them to carry

B oO K their provisions; and to complete their warlike ar-
.... ray, they took with them several of those fierce

s113. dogs, which were no lets formidable than deftruc-

tive to their naked enemies.

Discovers BALBOA set out upon this important expedition
.south on the firfl of September, about the time that the

periodical rains began to abate. He proceeded by
sea, and without any difficulty, to the territories of
a cazique whose friendship he had gained; but no
sooner did he begin to advance into the interior part
of the country, than he was retarded by every ob-
ifacle, which he had reason to apprehend, from the
nature of the territory, or the disposition of its inha-
bitants. Some of the caziques, at his approach,
fled to the mountains with all their people, and car-
ried off or destroyed whatever could afford fubfilt-
ence to his troops. Others colleced their fubjedts,
in order to oppose his progress, and he quickly per-
ceived what an arduous undertaking it was, to con-
du& such a body of men through hostile nations,
across swamps and rivers, and woods, which had
never been paned but by straggling Indians. But
by sharing in every hardship with the meanest fol-
dier, by appearing the foremost to meet every dan-
ger, by promising confidently to his troops the
enjoyment of honour and riches superior to what
had been attained by the most successful of their
countrymen, he inspired them with such enthufi-
aflic resolution, that they followed him without

murmuring.

murmuring. When they had penetrated a good B O K
way into the mountains, a powerful cazique ap- _
peared in a narrow pass, with a numerous body of 's'l
his fubjeEs, to obltru& their progress. But men
who had surmounted so many obstacles, despised
the opposition of such feeble enemies. They at-
tacked them with impecuofity, and having dispersed
them with much ease and great slaughter, continued
their march. Though their guides had represented
the breadth of the isthmus to be only a journey of
of fix days, they had already spent twenty-five in
forcing their way through the woods and mountains.
Many of them were ready to fink under such un-
interrupted fatigue in that sultry climate, several
were taken ill of the dysentery and other diseases
frequent in that country, and all became impatient
to reach the period of their labours and sufferings.
At length the Indians assured them, that from the
top of the next mountain they Ihould discover the
ocean which was the objet of their wishes. When,
with infinite toil, they had climbed up the greater
part of that steep ascent, Balboa commanded his
men to halt, and advanced alone to the fummir,
that he might be the first who lhould enjoy a spec-
tacle which he had so long desired. As soon as he
beheld the South Sea stretching in endleft profpe&
below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his
hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God, who
had conducted him to a discovery so beneficial to
his country, and so honourable to himself. Uis

with great alacrity, when Balboa advancing up to
the middle in the waves with his buckler and sword,
took pofeflion of that ocean in the name of the
king his master, and vowed to defend it, with these
arms, against all his enemiesc.

THAT part of the great Pacific or Southern

ocean, which Balboa first discovered, still retains
the name of the Gulf of St. Michael, which he
gave to it, and is situated to the east of Panama.
From several of the petty princes, who governed
in the diftri&s adjacent to that gulf, he extorted
provisions and gold by force of arms. Others sent
them to him voluntarily. To these acceptable
presents, some of the caziques added a confider-
able quantity of pearls; and he learned from them,
with much fatisfa&ion, that pearl oysters abounded
in the sea which he had newly discovered.

was a mighty and opulent kingdom situated at a B o o K
considerable distance towards the fouth-ealt, the in- l -
habitants of which had tame animals to carry their 'sq,
burdens. In order to give the Spaniards an idea
of these, they drew upon the sand the figure of the
Llamas or sheep, afterwards found in Peru, which
the Peruvians had taught to perform such services
as they described. As the Llama, in its form,
nearly resembles a camel, a beast of burden deemed
peculiar to Asia, this circumstance, in conjuncion
with the discovery of the pearls, another noted
producion of that country, tended to confirm the
Spaniards in their miltaken theory with refpet

own conjeAures and hopes, rendered him extremely
impatient to visit this unknown country, his pru-
dence restrained him from attempting to invade it
with an handful of men, exhausted by fatigue, and
weakened by diseases . He determined to lead
back his followers, at present, to their settlement at
Santa Maria in Darien, and to return next season
with a force more adequate to such an arduous en-
rerprize. In order to acquire a more extensive
knowledge of the isthmus, he marched back by a

1514. Balboa returned to Santa Maria, from which he

had been absent four months, with greater glory
and more treasure than the Spaniards had acquired
in any expedition in the New World. None of
Balboa's officers distinguished themselves more in
this service than Francilco Pizarro, or alfifted with
greater courage and ardour in opening a commu-
nication with those countries, in which he was
deffined to act oon a most illustrious part'.

Pcdrarnis BALBOA'S first care was to fend information to
gPvrn'or Spain of the important discovery which he had
ot uDaren. made; and to demand a reinforcement of a thou-

sand men, in order to attempt the conquest of that
opulent country, concerning which he had received
such inviting intelligence. The firlt account of
the difcovcry of the New World hardly occasioned
greater joy, than the unexpected tidings that a
pafhage was at last found to the great southern
cean. The communication with the East Indies,
by a course to the westward of the line of demarc-
ation, drawn by the Pope, seemed now to be
certain. The vast wealth which flowed into Por-
tugal from its fcttlements and conqucfts in that

country, excited the envy and called forth the B o K
emulation of other states. Ferdinand hoped now
to come in for a share in this lucrative commerce, '514
and in his eagerness to obtain it, was willing to
make an effort beyond what Balboa required. But
even in this exertion, his jealous policy, as well as
the fatal antipathy of Fonseca, now Bishop of Bur-
gos, to every man of merit who diltinguifhed him-
self in the New World, were conspicuous. Not-
withstanding Balboa's recent fervices,which marked
him out as the most proper perlbn to finish that
great undertaking which he had begun, Ferdinand
was so ungenerous as to overlook theef, and to ap-
point Pedrarias Davila governor of Darien. He
gave him the command of fifteen flout vessels, and
twelve hundred soldiers. These were fitted out at
the public expence, with a liberality which Ferdi-
nand had never displayed in any former armament
destined for the New World; and such was the ar-
dour of the Spanish gentlemen to follow a leader
who was about to conduct them to a country, where,
as fame reported, they had only to throw their nets
into the Tea and draw out gold s, that fifteen hun-
dred embarked on board the fleet, and if they had

they found Balboa, of whose great exploits they
had heard so much, and of whose opulence they
had formed such high ideas, clad in a canvas jacket,
and wearing coarse hempen sandals used only by the
meanest peasants, employed, together with orne
Indians, in thatching his own hut with reeds. Even
in this simple garb, which corresponded so ill with
the expectations and wishes of his new guests, Bal-
boa received them with dignity. The fame of his
discoveries had drawn so many adventurers froti
the islands, that he could now muster four hundred
and fifty men. At the head of those daring vete-
rans, he was more than a match for the forces
which Pedrarias brought with him. But though
his troops murmured loudly at the injustice of the
king in superseding their commander, and com-
plained that strangers would now reap the fruits of
their toil and success, Balboa Submitted with impli-
cit obedience to the will of his sovereign, and re-
ceived Pedrarias with all the deference due to his
chara&ter'.

mortification of being fubje&ted to trial and to pu-
nifhment in a place where he had so lately occupied
the first station. Pedrarias could not conceal his
jealousy of his superior merit; so that the resent,
ment of the one, and the envy of the other, gave
rife to dissensions extremely detrimental to the co-
lony. It was threatened with a calamity still more
fatal. Pedrarias had landed in Darien at a most July,
unlucky time of the year, about the middle of the
rainy season, in that part of the torrid zone where
the clouds pour down such torrents as are unknown
in more temperate climates k. The village of Santa
Maria was scated in a rich plain, environed with
tnarlhes and woods. The constitution of Europeans
was unable to withstand the pestilential influence of
such a situation, in a climate naturally so noxious,
and at a season so. peculiarly unhealthy. A violent
and deftru&ive malady carried off many of the fol-
diers who accompanied Pedrarias. An extreme
scarcity of provisions augmented this distress, as it
rendered it impoflible to find proper refreshment
for the tick, or the necessary sustenance for the
healthy 1. In the space of a month, above fix hun-
dred persons perished in the utmost misery. De-
jection and despair spread through the colony.

gion. Pedrarias endeavoured to divert those who
remained from brooding over their misfortunes, by
finding them employment. With this view, he
sent several detachments into the interior parts of
the country, to levy gold among the natives, and
to search for the mines in which it was produced.
Those rapacious adventurers, more attentive to pre-
sent gain than to the means of facilitating their fu-
ture progress, plundered without diftintion where-
ever they marched. Regardless of the alliances
which Balboa had made with several of the ca-
ziques, they stripped them of every thing valuable,
and treated them, as well as their subjects, with the
utmost insolence and cruelty. By their tyranny and
exadions, which Pedrarias, either from want of
authority or of inclination, did not restraint all the
country from the gulf of Darien to the lake of
Nicaragua was desolated, and the Spaniards were
inconsiderately deprived of the advantages which
they might have derived from the friendihip of the
natives, in extending their conquests to the South
Sea. Balboa, who saw with concern that such ill-
judged proceedings retarded the execution of his
favourite scheme, sent violent remonstrances to
Spain against the imprudent government of Pedra-
rias, which had ruined a happy and flourishing co-
lony. Pedrarias, on the other hand, accuscd him

I of

of having deceived the Iing, by magnifying his Bn o K
own exploits, as well as by a false representation of .
the opulence and value of the country". s514

FERDINAND became sensible at length of his im- violent

prudence in superseding the most ative and expe- ings agait
rienced officer he had in the New World, and, by
way ofcompenfation to Balboa, appointed him Ade-
lantado, or Lieutenant-governor of the countries
upon the South Sea, with very extensive privileges
and authority. At the fame time he enjoined Pe-
drarias to support Balboa in, all his operations, and
to consult with him concerning every measure which
he himself pursued. But to effet such a sudden rtS1
transition from inveterate enmity to perfet con-
fidence, exceeded Ferdinand's power. Pedrarias
continued to treat his rival with negle&; and Bal-
boa's fortune being exhausted by the payment of his
fine, and other exations of Pedrarias, he could
not make suitable preparations for taking polTeflion
of his new government. At length, by the inter-
position and exhortations of the bishop of Darien,
they were brought to a reconciliation; and, in or-
der to cement this union more firmly, Pedrarias
agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Balboa.
The first effect of their concord was, that Balboa s5t6.
was permitted to make several fmoall incursions into

ivll dence, as added to the reputation which he had al-
;5'6. ready acquired. Many adventurers resorted to him,

and, with the countenance and aid of Pedrarias, he
began to prepare for his expedition to the South
Sea. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary
to build vessels capable of conveying his troops to
.'C7. those provinces which he purposed to invade, As-

ter surmounting many obstacles, and enduring a
variety of those hardships which were the portion
of the conquerors of America, he at length finished
four small brigantines. In thcfe, with three hun-
dred chosen men, a force fiuperior to that with which
Pizarro afterwards undertook the fame expedition,
he was ready to fail towards Peru, when he re-
ceived an unexpected message from Pedrarias". As
his reconciliation with Balboa had never been cor-
dial, the progress which his fon-in-law was making
revived his ancient enmity, and added to its ran-
cour. He dreaded the prosperity and elevation of
a man whom he had injured so deeply. He fiifpe-t-
ed that success would encourage him to aim at in-
dependence upon his jurifditlion; and so violently
did the passions of hatred, fear, and jealousy, ope-
rate upon his mind, that, in order to gratify his
vengeance, he scrupled not to defeat an enterprii:
of the grcatcft moment to his country. Under
pretexts which were falie, but plausible, he desired
Balboa to poftponc his voyage for a short time, and

to repair to Acla, in order that he might have an B o o K
interview with him. Balboa, with the unfufpicious I
confidence of a man conscious of no crime, in- '517.
ftantly obeyed the summons; but as soon as he tn-
tered the place, he was arrested by order of Pedra-
rias, whose impatience to satiate his revenge did
not fuflfr him to languifl long in confinement,
Judges were immediately appointed to proceed to
his trial. An acculation of diloyalty to the king,
and of an intention to revolt againlt the governor,
was preferred againit him. Sentence of death was
pronounced; and though the judges who pased it,
fcconded by the whole colony, interceded warmly
for his pardon, Pedrarias continued inexorable; and
the Spaniards beheld, with aftoniihment and sorrow,
the public execution of a man whom they univer-
sally deemed more capable than any who had borne
command in America, of forming and accomplish-
ing great designs 0. Upon his death, the expedition
which he had planned was relinquished. Pedrarias,
notwithflanding the violence and injustice of his
proceedings, was not only screened from punifli-
ment by the powerful patronage of the bishop of
Burgos and other courtiers, but continued in power.
Soon after, he obtained permiflion to remove
the colony from its unwholesome station of Santa
Maria to Panama, on the opposite fide of the ifth.
mus; and though it did not gain much in point of
healthfulness by the change, the commodious fitua-

rupted tenour, fevcral important events occurred
with refpeet to the discovery, the conquest, and
government, of other provinces in the New World.
Ferdinand was so intent upon opening a communi-
cation with the Molucca or Spice Islands by the
well, that, in the year one thousand five hundred
and fifteen, he fitted out two ships at his own ex-
pence, in order to attempt such a voyage, and gave
the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who
was deemed one of the most skilful navigators in
Spain. He stood along the coast of South Ame-
rica, and on the first of January one thousand five
hundred and sixteen, entered a river which he call-
ed Janeiro, where an extensive commerce is now
carried on. From thence he proceeded to a fpaci-
ous bay, which he supposed to be the entrance into
a strait that communicated with the Indian ocean ;
but upon advancing farther, he found it to be the
mouth of Rio de Plata, one of the vafi rivers by
which the southern continent of America is watered.
In endeavouring to make a descent in this country,

in pieces, roasted and devoured them. Difcou- U'-
raged with the loss of their commander, and terrified 'st7
at this (hocking fpe&acle, the surviving Spaniards
set fail for Europe, without aiming at any farther
discovery s. Though this attempt proved abortive,
it was not without benefit. It turned the attention
of ingenious men to this course of navigation, and
prepared She way for a more fortunate voyage, by
which, a few years posterior to this period, the
great design that Ferdinand had in view was ac-
complifhed.

THOUGH the Spaniards were thus aCtively em- Stateoftlie

ployed in extending their discoveries and fettle- iili'ola
ments in America, they still confidered Hispaniola
as their principal colony, and the feat of govern-
ment. Don Diego Columbus wanted neither in-
clination nor abilities to have rendered the mem-
bers of this colony, who were most immediately
under his jurifdietion, prosperous and happy. But
he was circumscribed in all his operations by the
suspicious policy of Ferdinand, who on every occa-
lion, and under pretexts the most frivolous, re-
trenched his privileges, and encouraged the trca-
furer, the judges, and other subordinate officers,
to counteract his measures, and to dispute his au-
thority. The most valuable prerogative which
the governor polTeffed, was that of diltributing In.

,- _ The rigorous servitude of those unhappy men hav-
5'7' ing been but little mitigated by all the regulations

in their favour, the power of parcelling out such
necessary instruments of labour at pleasure, secured
to the governor great influence in the colony. In
order to strip him of this, Ferdinand created a new
office, with the power of distributing the Indians,
and bestowed it upon Rodrigo Albuquerque, a rela-
tion of Zapata, his confidential minister. Mortified
with the injustice, as well as indignity, of this inva-
sion upon his rights, in a point so essential, Don
Diego could no longer remain in a place where his
power and consequence were almost annihilated. He
repaired to Spain with the vain hopes of obtain-
ing redress'. Albuquerque entered upon his of-
fice with all the rapacity of an indigent adventurer,
impatient to amass wealth. He began with taking
the exact number of Indians in the island, and
found, that from sixty thousand, who, in the year
one thousand five hundred and eight, survived after
all their sufferings, they were now reduced to four-
teen thousand. These he threw into separate divi-
sions or lots, and bestowed them upon such as were
willing to purchase them at the highest price. By
this arbitrary distribution, several of the natives
were removed from their original habitations, many
were taken from their ancient matiers, and all of
them fubje&ed to heavier burdens, and to more in-

with the fatal consequences which attended them, refpee to

the treat-

not only excited complaints among such as thought mcnt of

who retained any sentiments of humanity. From
the time that Ecclesiastics were sent as infru6tors
into America, they perceived that the rigour with
which their countrymen treated the natives, ren-
dered their ministry altogether fruitless. The mif-
fionaries, in conformity to the mild spirit of that
religion which they were employed to publish, early
remonstrated againit the maxims of the planters
with refpe& to the Americans; and condemned
the repartimientos, or diJiributions, by which they
were given up as slaves to their conquerors, as no
less contrary to natural justice and the precepts of
Christianity, than to found policy. The Domini-
cans, to whom the inftrution of the Americans
was originally committed, were most vehement in
testifying against the repartimientos. In the year
one thousand five hundred and eleven, Montefino,
one of their most eminent preachers, inveighed
against this practice in the great church at St. Do-

B OO K mingo, with all the impetuosity of popular ela-

._^ quence. Don Diego Columbus, the principal
517.- officers of the colony, and all the laymen who had

been his hearers, complained of the monk to his
superiors; but they, instead of condemning, ap-
plauded his doctrine, as equally pious and season-
able. The Franciscans, influenced by the spirit of
opposition and rivalfhip which subsists between the
two orders, discovered some inclination to take
part with the laity, and to espouse the defence of
the repartiiiientos. But as they could not with
decency give their avowed approbation to a sys-
tem of oppreffon, so repugnant to the spirit of
religion, they endeavoured to palliate what they
could not justify, and alleged, in excuse for the con-
duEt of their countrymen, that it was impoflible
to carry on any improvement in the colony, un-
less the Spaniards possessed such dominion over the
natives, that they could compel them to labour'.

Contrary THE Dominicans, regardless of such political
decilions concrning and interested considerations, would not relax in
ta point. any degree the rigour of their sentiments, and

even refused to absolve, or admit to the sacrament,
such of their countrymen as continued to hold the
natives in servitude". Both parties applied to the
king for his decision in a matter of such import-

ance. Ferdinand empowered a committee of his B 0 o K
privy-council, assisted by some of the most emi- -.j
nent civilians and divines in Spain, to hear the '5'?'
deputies sent from Hispaniola, in support of their
refpetive opinions. After a long difcufion, the
speculative point in controversy was determined in
favour of the Dominicans, the Indians were de-
clared to be a free people, intitled to all the na-
tural rights of men; but, notwithstanding this
decision, the repartimientos were continued upon
their ancient footingw. As this determination
admitted the principle upon which the Dominicans
founded their opinion, they renewed their efforts to
obtain relief for the Indians with additional bold-
ness and zeal. At length, in order to quiet the
colony, which was alarmed by their remonstrances
and censures, Ferdinand issued a decree of his
privy council, declaring, that after mature confi-
(leration of the Apostolic Bull, and other titles by
which the crown of Castile claimed a right to its s3.
poffelsions in the New World, the fcrvitude of the
Indians was warranted both by the laws of God and
of man; that unless they were fubjeaed to the do-
minion of the Spaniards, and compelled to reside
under their infpe&tion, it would be impoflible to
reclaim them from idolatry, or to inftrut them in
the principles of the Christian faith; that no far-
ther scruple ought to be entertained concerning

B O O K the lawfulness of the repartimientos, as the king
a.-,-,a and council were willing to take the charge of
'5'7 that upon their own consciences; and that there-

fore the Dominicans, and monks of other religious
orders, should abstain, for the future, from those
invectives, which, from an excess of charitable
but ill-informed zeal, they had uttered against
that pratice Y.

THAT his intention of adhering to this decree

might be fully understood, Ferdinand conferred
hew grants of Indians upon several of his courtiersZ.
But in order that he might not seem altogether in-
attentive to the rights of humanity, he publilhed an
edi&t, in which he endeavoured to provide for the
mild treatment of the Indians under the yoke to
which he subjeCted them; he regulated the nature
of the work which they should be required to per-
form, he prescribed the mode in which they Should
be clothed and fed, and gave diretions with refpe&
to their inftruEtion in the principles of Christianity'.

Erfca of BUT tih Dominicans, who from their experience
thcft. of what was palt, judged concerning the future,

soon perceived the inefficacy of those provisions,
and foretold, that as long as it was the interest of
individuals to treat the Indians with rigour, no pub-
lic regulations could render their servitude mild or

their own time and strength in attempting to comn-
municate the sublime truths of religion to men, Pty.
whose spirits were broken, and their faculties im-
paired by opprellion. Some of them, in despair,
requeifed the permiflion of their superiors to remove
to the continent, and to pursue the objec of their
million among such of the natives as were not hi-
therto corrupted by the example of the Spaniards,
or alienated by their cruelty from the Christian
faith. Such as remained in Hispaniola continued
to remonstrate, with decent firmness, against the
servitude of the Indians b.

THE violent operations of Albuquerque, the new Bthoo-

distributor of Indians, revived the zeal of the Do- , dc'dl
minicans against the repartimie#tos, and called forth per in ,
an advocate for that oppressed people, who pof- the ndianl
sessed all the courage, the talents, and activity re-
quifite in supporting such a desperate cauIe. This
was Bartholomew de las Casas, a native of Seville,
and one of the clergymen sent out with Columbus
in his second voyage to Hispaniola, in order to
fettle in that island. He early adopted the opinion
prevalent among ecclesiastics, with refpe&t to the
unlawfulness of reducing the natives to servitude;
and that he might demonstrate the sincerity of his
conviction, he relinquished all the Indians who had

he became the avowed patron of the Indians; and
by his bold interpositions in their behalf, as well as
by the refpet due to his abilities and character, he
had often the merit of setting some bounds to the
excesses of his countrymen. He did not fail to
remonstrate warmly against the proceedings of Al-

tion to his own interest rendered this rapacious
officer deaf to admonition, he did not abandon the
wretched people whose cause he had espoused. He

guilt of having authorised this impious measure, a o o0
which had brought misery and deftrufion upon a
numerous and innocent race of men, whom Provi- 's'
dence had placed under his protetion. Ferdinand,
whose mind as well as body was much enfeebled by
his distemper, was greatly alarmed at this charge of
impiety, which at another junture he would have
despised. He listened with deep compun&ion to
the discourse of Las Casas, and promiied to take
into serious consideration the means of redrelling
the evil of which he complained. But death pre-
vented him from executing his resolution. Charles
ofAuftria, to whom all his crowns devolved, resided
at that time in his paternal dominions in the Low
Countries. Las Casas, with his usual ardour, pre-
pared immediately to set out for Slanders, in order
to occupy the ear of the young monarch, when car-
dinal Ximenes, who, as regent, assumed the reins of
government in Calile, commanded him to desist

Coon fixed upon a plan which astonished the mini-
fters, trained up under the formal and cautious admi-
niftration of Ferdinand. Without regarding either
the rights of Don Diego Columbus, or the regula-
tions eftablilhed by the late king, he resolved to

U.all the colonies there, with authority, after examin-
*5'7. ing all circumstances on the spot, to decide finally

with refpe& to the point in question. It was a
matter of deliberation and delicacy to chute men
qualified for such an important station. As all the
laymen fettled in America, or who had been con-
fulted in the administration of that department, had
given their opinion that the Spaniards could not
keep poffiefon of their new Settlements, unless they
were allowed to retain their dominion over the
Indians, he saw that he could not rely on their im-
partiality, and determined to commit the trust to
ecclesiastics. As the Dominicans and Franciscans
had already espouscd opposite fides in the contro-
verfy, he, from the fame principle of impartiality,
excluded both these fraternities from the- commis-
sion. He confined his choice to the monks of
St. Jerome, a small, but refpe&able order in
Spain. With the afllftance of their general, and
in concert with Las Casas, he soon pitched upon
three persons whom he deemed equal to the
charge. To them he joined Zuazo, a private
lawyer of distinguished probity, with unbounded
power to regulate all judicial proceedings in the
colonies. Las Casas was appointed to accom-
·pany them, with the title of proteetor of the
Indians '.

gerous, that they refused to issue the dispatches ne-
ceffary for carrying it into execution. But Xime-
nes was not of a temper patiently to brook oppo-
fition to any of his schemes. He sent for the
refratory ministers, and addressed them in such a
tone, that in the utmost consternation they obeyed
his orders . The fuperintendants, with their affo-
ciate Zuazo, and Las Casas, failed for St. Domingo.
Upon their arrival, the first aft of their authority
was to set at liberty all the Indians who had been
granted to the Spanish courtiers, or to any person
not residing in America. This, together with the
information which had been received from Spain
concerning the object of the commillion, spread
a general alarm. The colonists concluded that they
were to be deprived at once of the hands with
which they carried on their labour, and that, of
consequence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fa-
thers of St. Jerome proceeded with such caution
and prudence, as soon diflipated all their fears.
They discovered, in every ftep of their conduct, a

1517- persons trained up in the solitude and austerity of a

monafdic life. Their ears were open to information
from every quarter, they compared the different
accounts which they received, and, after a mature
consideration of the whole, they were fully satisfied
that the state of the colony rendered it impoflible
to adopt the plan proposed by Las Casas, and re-
commended by the Cardinal. They plainly per-
ceived that the Spaniards fettled in America were
so few in number, that they could neither work the
mines which had been opened, nor cultivate the
country; that they depended for effecRing both,
upon the labour of the natives, and if deprived of
it, they mufft instantly relinquilh their conquests,
or give up all the advantages which they derived
from them; that no allurement was so powerful as
to surmount the natural aversion of the Indians to
any laborious effort, and that nothing but the au-
thority of a master could compel them to work;
and if they were not kept constantly under the eye
and discipline of a superior, so great was their na-
tural listlessness and indifference, that they would
neither attend to religious inftrution, nor obfrve
those rites of Christianity which they had been al-
ready taught. Upon all those accounts, the super-
intendents found it neceflary to tolerate the repar-
tiinientos, and to susser the Indians to remain under
fubjecion to their Spanish matters. They used

their

their utmost endeavours, however, to prevent the B o o K
fatal effe&ts of this establishment, and to secure to . 1_1
the Indians the consolation of the best treatment 's17
compatible with a state of servitude. For this pur-
pose, they revived former regulations, they pre.
fcribed new ones, they negle&ed no circumstance
that tended to mitigate the rigour of the yoke;
and by their authority, their example, and their
exhortations, they laboured to inspire their coun-
trymen with sentiments of equity and gentleness
towards the unhappy people upon whose industry
they depended. Zuazo, in his department, fe-
conded the endeavours of the superintendents. He
reformed the courts of justice, in such a manner
as to render their decisions equitable as well as ex-
peditious, and introduced various regulations which
greatly improved the interior police of the colony.
The fatisfaftion which his condut, and that of the
superintendents gave, was now universal among the
Spaniards fettled in the New World, and all ad-
mired the boldness of Ximenes, in having departed
from the ordinary path of bufiners in forming his
plan, as well as his sagacity, in pitching upon
persons, whose wisdom, moderation, and difin-
tereftednefs rendered them worthy of this high
trust .

that the Indians were by nature free, and, as their
protecor, he required the superintendents not to
bereave them of the common privilege of huma-
nity. They received his most virulent remon-
Itrances without emotion, but adhered firmly to
their own system. The Spanish planters did not
bear with him so patiently, and were ready to tear
him in pieces for insisting in a requisition so odious
to them. Las Calas, in order to screen himself
from their rage, found it necessary to take ihelter
in a convent; and perceiving that all his efforts in
America were fruitless, he soon set out for Europe,
with a fixed resolution not to abandon the pro-
teetion of a people whom he deemed to be cruelly

to all the tranfations in his new kingdom, and
they, with an indiscreet eagerness, intruded them-
selves into every business, and seized almost every
department of administration'. The direction of
American affairs was an objet too alluring to
escape their attention. Las Calis observed their
growing influence, and though projectors are
usually too sanguine to condu& their schemes with
much dexterity, he possessed a bustling indefati-
gable a&ivity, which sometimes accomplishes its
purposes with greater success, than the most ex-
quifite discernment and address. He courted the
Flemish Ministers with assiduity. He represented
to them the absurdity of all the maxims hitherto
adopted with refpedt to the government of Ame-
rica, particularly during the administration of Ser-
dinand, and pointed out the defets of those
arrangements which Ximenes had introduced.
The memory of Ferdinand was odious to the
Flemings. The superior virtue and abilities of
Ximenes had long been the object of their envy.

B o oK They fondly wished to have a plausible pretext
eL. ,_ for condemning the measures, both of the mo-

J5s7 narch and of the minister, and of reflecting fonme

discredit on their political wisdom. The friends
of Don Diego Columbus, as well as the Spanith
courtiers, who had been dissatisfied with the Car-
dinal's adminitfration, joined Las Casas in censuring
the fclheme of fending superintendents to America.
This union of so many interests and passions was
irresistible; and, in consequence of it, the fathers
of St. Jerome, together with their associate
Zuazo, were recalled. Rotderigo de Figueroa, a
lawyer of rome eminence, was appointed chief
judge of the island, and received inftruAions, in
compliance with the request of Las Casas, to ex-
amine once more, with the utmost attention, the
point in controversy between him and the people
of the colony, with refpedt to the treatment of the
natives; and in the mean time to do every thing in
his power to alleviate their sufferings, and prevent
the extinction of the race'.

Schtmcof THIS was all that the zeal of Las Casas could
the Colonies procure, at that juncture, in favour of the Indians.
goine. T'he impoflibility of carrying on any improvement

in America, unllcfs the Spanish planters could
command the labour of the natives, was an infu-
perable objection to his plan of treating them as

free subje&s. In order to provide some remedy B o o K
for this, without which he found it was in vain to il,
mention his scheme, Las Casas proposed to pur- 's'y
chafe a sufficient number of negroes fromt the Por-
tuguefe settlements on the coast of Africa, and to
transport them to America, in order that they
might be employed as slaves in working the mines
and cultivating the ground. One of the firit ad-
vantages which the Portuguese had derived from
their discoveries in Africa, arose from the trade in
saves. Various circumstances concurred in reviv-
ing this odious commerce, which had been long.
abolished in Europe, and which is no less repug-
nant to the feelings of humanity, than to the prin-
ciples of religion. As tearly as the year one
thousand five hundred and three, a few negro
slaves had been sent into the New Worldk. In
the year one thousand five hundred and eleven,
Ferdinand permitted the importation of them in
greater numbers'. They were found to be a more
robust and hardy race than the natives of America.
They were more capable of enduring fatigue,
more patient under servitude, and the labour of
one negro was computed to be equal to that of four
Indians". Cardinal Ximenes, however, when
solicited to encourage this commerce, perempto-
rily rejected the proposition, because he perceived
the iniquity of reducing one race of men to slavery,

while

B o K while he was consulting about the means of re-
v- flatoring liberty to another". But Las Casas, from
s,7- the inconsistency natural to men who hurry with

headlong impetuosity towards a favourite point,
was incapable of making this diftination. While
he contended earnefily for the liberty of the peo-
ple born in one quarter of the globe, he laboured
to enslave the inhabitants of another region; and
in the warmth of his zeal to save the Americans
from the yoke, pronounced it to be lawful and
expedient to impose one fill heavier upon the
Africans. Unfortunately for the iarter, Las Cafas's
plan was adopted. Charles granted a patent to
one of his Flemish favourites, containing an ex-
clufive right of importing four thousand negroes
into America. The favourite fold his patent to
fomc Genoese merchants for twenty-five thousand
ducats, and they were the first who brought into a
regular form that commerce for slaves between
Africa and America, which has since been carried
on to such an amazing extent°.

propourc operations, at firl, with the rapacity of monopo-
iboursto lilts, demanded fich an high price for negroes,

Las Casas, whosl zeal was no less inventive than

inde-

indefatigable, had recourse to another expedient for Ba o o
the relief of the Indians. He observed, that most , l'".i
of the persons who had fettled hitherto in America, 5s17
were sailors and soldiers employed in the discovery
or conquest of the country; the younger sons of
noble families, allured by the prospect of acqui-
ring sudden wealth; or defperatc adventurers, whom
their indigence or crimes forced to abandon their
native land. Initead of such men, who were dillo-
lute, rapacious, and incapable of that fober perse-
vering industry which is requisite in forming new
colonies, he proposed to supply the settlements in
Hispaniola and other parts of the New World with
a sufficient number of labourers and husbandmen,
who should be allured by fuitnble premiums to re-
move thither. These, as they were accustomed to
fatigue, would be able to perform the work, to
which the Indians, from the fccbleness of their con-
ftitution, were unequal, and might soon become
useful and opulent citizens. But though Hispaniola
stood much in need of a recruit of inhabitants, ha-
ving been visited at this time with the small-pox,
which fwvept off almost all the natives who had fur-
vived their long-continued oppreflion, and though
Las Casas had the countenance of the Flemish mi-
nifters, this scheme was defeated by the bishop of
Burgos, who thwarted all his projecs P.

LAS CASAS now despaired of procuring any re- Forms the

niards

B 0 0 K ards were already fettled. The evil was become so

v-- inveterate there, as not to admit of a cure. But
I517' such discoveries were daily making in the continent,

as gave an high idea both of its extent and popu-
loufnefs. In all those vaef regions there was but
one feeble colony planted; and except a small spot
on the isthmus of Darien, the natives still occupied
the whole country. This opened a new and more
ample field for the humanity and zeal of Las Casas,
who flattered himfilf that lie might prevent a per-
nicious system from being introduced there, though
he had failed of success in his attempts to overturn
it, where it was already eftablihed. Full of this
idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccupied
country, stretching along the sea-coast from the
gulf of Paria to the western frontier of that province
now known by the name of Santa Martha. He
proposed to fettle there with a colony composed of
husbandmen, labourers, and ecclesiastics. He en-
gaged, in the space of two years, to civilize ten
thousand of the natives, and to inftrut them so
thoroughly in the arts of lbcial life, that, from the
fruits of their induatry, an annual revenue of fifteen
thousand ducats should arise to the king. In ten
years he expected that his improvements would be
so far advanced, as to yield annually sixty thousand
ducats. He stipulated, that no tailor or soldier
should ever be permitted to fettle in this diltrid;
and that no Spaniard whatever flmould enter it with.
out his permifflon. He even projected to clothe

9 tllC

the people whom he took along with him in some B o o :
distinguishing garb, which did not resemble ;he E-.,
Spaniih dress, that they might appear to the natives 1'7-
to be a different race of men from those who had
brought so many calamities upon their country.
From this scheme, of which I have traced only the
great lines, it is manifest that Las Casas had formed
ideas concerning the method of treating the Indi-
ans, similar to those by which the Jesuits afterwards
carried on their great operations in another part of
the fame continent. He flippofed that the Europe-
ans, by availing themselves of that ascendant which
they possessed in consequence of their fuperiorpro-
grefs in science and improvement, might gradually
form the minds of the Americans to relish those
comforts of which they were destitute, might train
them to the arts of civil life, and render them ca-
pable of its funtions.

BUT to the bishop of Burgos and the council of Favourably

the Indies this projec appeared not only chime- received.
rical, but dangerous in a high degree. They
deemed the faculties of the Americans to be natu-
rally so limited, and their indolence so excessive,
that every attempt to inftruc or to improve them
would be fruitless. They contended, that it would
be extremely imprudent to give the command of a
country extending above a thousand miles along
the coast, to a fanciful prefumptuou enthufiaf, a.

£5'7· far from being discouraged with a repulse, which

he had realbn to expe&, had recourse once more
to the Flemish favourites, who zealously patronized
his scheme, merely because it had been rejected by
the Spanish ministers. They prevailed with their
master, who had lately been raised to the Imperial
dignity, to refer the consideration of this measure
to a felec number of his privy-counfellors; and
Las Casas having excepted againfl the members of
the counsel of the Indies, as partial and interested,
they were all excluded. The decision of men
chosen by recommendation of the Flemings, was
perfecly conformable to their sentiments. They
warmly approved of Las Cafas's plan; and gave
orders for carrying it into execution, but reftriaed
the territory allotted him to' three hundred miles

to adopt the sentiments of his ministers, with such
fubmifllve deference as did not promise that deci- s,'7*
five vigour of mind which distinguishmd his riper
years, could not help fufpe&ing that the eagerness
with which the Flemings took part in every affair
relating to America, flowed from some improper
motive, and began to discover an inclination to
examine in person into the state of the question
concerning the characer of the Americans, and the
proper manner of treating them. An opportunity June ao.
us making this inquiry with great advantage soon
occurred. Quevedo, the bishop of Darien, who
had accompanied Pedrarias to the continent in the
year one thousand five hundred and thirteen, hap-
pened to land at Barcelona, where the court then
resided. It was quickly known, that his senti-
ments concerning the talents and disposition of the
Indians differed from those of Las Casas; and
Charles naturally concluded that by confronting
two refpecable persons, who, during their refi-
dence in America, had full leisure to observe tle
manners of the people whom they pretended to
describe, he might be able to discover which of
them had formed his opinion with the greatest dif-
cernment and accuracy.

A DAY for this solemn audience was appointed.

The emperor appeared with extraordinary pomp,
and took his feat on a throne in the great hall of

u a the

B o0 K the palace. His principal courtiers attended. Don

ill. Avl-^ Diego Columbus, admiral of the Indies, was fum-
1517' moned to be present. The bishop of Darien was

called updn first to deliver his opinion. He, in a
short discourse, lamented the fatal desolation of
America, by the extinction of so many of its in-
habitants; he acknowledged that this must be im-
puted, in some degree, to the exceflive rigour and
inconsiderate proceedings of the Spaniards; but
declared, that all the people of the New World,
whom he had seen either in the continent or in the
islands, appeared to him to be a race of men
marked out, by the inferiority of their talents,
for servitude, and whom it would be impoflible to
inftrua or improve, unless they were kept under
the continual infpescion of a master. Las Casas, at
greater length, and with more fervour, defended
his own system. He rejeced with indignation the
idea that any race of men was born to servitude, as
irreligious and inhuman. He asserted, that the
faculties of the Americans were not naturally defpi-
cable, but unimproved; that they were capable of
receiving inltrucion in the principles of religion,
as well as of acquiring the industry and arts which
would qualify them for the various offices of social
life ; that the mildncis and timidity of their nature
rendered them so fibmiflive and docile, that they
might be led and formed with a gentle hand. lie
professed, that his intentions in proposing the
scheme now under consideration were pure and dif-

CHARLES, after hearing both, and consulting with T!ie fihe

his ministers, did not think himself sufficiently in- approved

perfea confidence in the integrity of Las Casas,

him the diftria in Cumana formerly mentionedt

which cultivated their estates, his progrcfs in engag-

received an account of a new obstacle to the execu-
tion of his scheme, more insuperable than any he
had hitherto encountered. When he left America
in the year one thousand five hundred and sixteen,
the Spaniards had little intercourse with any part
of the continent, except the countries adjacent to
the gulf of Darien. But as every species of inter-
nal industry began to stagnate in Hispaniola, when,
by the rapid decrease of the natives, the Spaniards
were deprived of those hands with which they had
hitherto carried on their operations, this prompted
them to try various expedients for supplying that
loss. Considerable numbers of negroes were im-
ported; but, on account of their exorbitant price,
many of the planters could not afford to purchal:
them. In order to procure slaves at an easier
rate, some of the Spaniards in Hispaniola fitted
out veiffls to cruize along the coast of the conti-
nent. In places where they found themselves in-
ferior in ftrcngth, they traded with the natives, and
gave European toys in exchange for the plates of
gold worn by them as ornaments; but, wherever
they could filrprife or overpower the Indians, they
carried them off by force, and fold them as

slaves.

Caves'. In those predatory excursions, such atro- B OO K
cious a&s of violence and cruelty had been commit-
ted, that the Spanish name was held in detestation all 's7.
over the continent. Whenever any lhips appeared,
the inhabitants either fled to the woods, or rushed
down to the shore in arms, to repel those hated
disturbers of their tranquillity. They forced some
parties of the Spaniards to retreat with precipitation;
they cut offothers i and in the violence of their resent-
ment agairft the whole nation, they murdered two
Dominican miflionaries, whose zeal had prompted
them to fettle in the province of Cumana ". This
outrage against persons revered for their fanftity,
excited such indignation among the people of His-
paniola, who, notwithstanding all their licentious
and cruel proceedings, were possessed with a won-
derful zeal for religion, and a fuperflitious refpe&
for its ministers, that they determined to inflict ex-
emplary punishment, not only upon the perpetra-
tors of that crime, but upon the whole race. With
this view, they gave the command of five flips and
three hundred men to Diego Ocampo, with orders
to lay waste the country of Cumana with fire and
sword, and to transport all the inhabitants as slaves
to H-Iiraniola. This armament Las Casas found at
Puerto Rico, in its way to the continent; and as
Ocampo refused to defer his voyage, he immedi-
ately perceived that it would be impossible to
attempt the execution of his pacific plan in a

Labours to
surmount unfortunate incident, he set fail directly for St. Do-
tlleni mingo, leaving his followers cantoned out among

the planters in Puerto Rico. From many concur-
ring causes, the reception which Las Casas met
with in Hispaniola was very unfavourable. In his
negociations for the relief of the Indians, he had
censured the condut of his countrymen fettled
there with such honest severity as rendered him uni-
verfally odious to them. They confidered their
own ruin as the inevitable consequence of his fuc-
cess. They were now elated with hope of receiving
a large recruit of slaves from Cumana, which must
be relinquilhed if Las Casas were aflifled in fettling
his proje ted colony there. Figueroa, in confe-
quence of the inftrusions which he had received in
-Spain, had made an experiment concerning the ca-
pacity of the Indians, that was represented as decisive
against the system of Las Casas. He colleced in His-
paniola a good number of the natives, and fettled
them in two villages, leaving them at perfect li-
berty, and with the uncontrolled dire&ion of their
own actions. But that people, accustomed to a
mode of life extremely different from that which
takes place wherever civiliz:lion has made any con-
fiderable progress, were incapable of afuming new

so devoid of solicitude or foresight in providing for

them as children, who should be kept under the

he had planted at a place which he named Toledo,

his residence, though deserted both by the troops
appointed to protect him, and by those under the
command of Ocampo, who foresaw and dreaded
the calamities to which he must be exposed in that
wretched fation. He made the best provision in
his power for the safety and fubfiltence of his fol-
lowers; but as his utmost efforts availed little to-
wards fccuring either the one or the other, he re-
turned to Hispaniola, in order to solicit more
effetual aid for the preservation of men, who from
confidence in him had ventured into a post of so
much danger. Soon after his departure, the na-
tives, having discovered the feeble and defenceless
ifate of the Spaniards, assembled secretly, attacked
them with the fury natural to men exasperated by
many injuries, cut off a good number, and com-
pelled the reft to fly in the utmost consternation to

THOUGH the expulfGon of the colony from Cu-

dred and twenty-one, I have chosen to trace the
progress of Las Cafas's negociations from their first
4fe to their final issue without interruption. His
system was the obje& of long and attentive dif-
cuffion; and though his efforts in behalf of the op-
pressed Americans, partly from his own raflinefs
and imprudence, and partly from the malevolent
opposition of his adversarics, were not attended
with that success which he promised with too fan-
guine confidence, great praise is due to his humane
activity, which gave rife to various regulations that
were of some benefit to that unhappy people. I

the

B 0c K die most flourishing of the Spanish settlements,

..---.. The fame of this allured thither many persons from
's51' the other colonies, in hopes of finding either some

permanent establishment or some employment for
their activity. As Cuba lay to the weft of all the
islands occupied by the Spaniards, and as the ocean,
which stretches beyond it towards that quarter, had
not hitherto been explored, these circumstances nA-
turally invited the inhabitants to attempt new disco.
veries. An expedition for this purpose, in which aCi-
vity and resolution might conduc to sudden wealth,
was more suited to the genius of the age, than the
patient industry requisite in clearing ground, and ma.-
nufa&turing sugar. Infligated by this spirit, several
officers, who had served under Pedrarias in Darien,
entered into an association to undertake a voyage of
discovery. They persuaded Francisco Hcrnandez
Cordova, an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of
diitinguifhed courage, to join with them in the ad-
venture, and chore him to be their commander. Ve-
lafquez not only approved of the design, but aifi(lcd
in carrying it on. As the veterans from Darien were
extremely indigent, he and Cordova advanced money
for purchasing three finall vetels, and furnifling
them with every thing requisite either for traffic or
for war. A hundred and ten men embarked on
board of them, and failed from Sc. Jago de Cuba
on the eighth of February one thousand five hun-
dred and fievnteen. By the advice of their chief
pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had served under

the

the firit admiral Columbus, they flood direcly weft, B 0 0 K
relying on the opinion of that great navigator, who
uniformly maintained that a westerly course would 15'
lead to the most important discoveries.

ON the twventy-firft day after their departure

from St. Jago, they saw land, which proved to be
Cape Catoche, the eaflcrn point of that large pe-
ninfula projecting from the continent of America,
which Rfill retains its original name of 2Tucatan. As Yucatan.
they approached the ihore, five canoes came off
full of people decently clad in cotton garments; an
aftonilhing spectacle to the Spaniards, who had
found every other part of America possesed by
naked savages. Cordova endeavoured by small
presents to gain the good-will of there people.
They, though amazed at the ifrange objects now
presented for the firIf time to their view, invited
the Spaniards to visit their habitations, with an ap-
pearance of cordiality. They landed accordingly,
and as they advanced into the country, they ob-
served with new wonder some large houses built
with itonc. But they soon found that, if the people
of Yucatan had made progreIs in improvement
beyond their countrymen, they were likewise more
artful and warlike. For though the caziquc re-
ceived Cordova with many tokens of friendship, he
had posted a considerable body of his fubjets in
ambush behind a thicket, who, upon a signal given
by him, rushed out and attacked the Spaniards

with

B o o0 with great boldness, and some degree of martial

_- order. At the first flight of their arrows, fifteen
15'7- of the Spaniards were wounded; but the Indians

were f-ruck with such terror by the sudden explo-
sion of the fire-arms, and so surprised at the exe-
cution done by them, by the cross-bows, and by
the other weapons of their new enemies, that they
fled precipitately. Cordova quitted a country
where he had met with such a fierce reception,
carrying off two prisoners, together with the orna-
ments of a small temple, which he plundered in his
retreat,

IFE continued his course towards the weft, with-

out losing fight of the coafP, and on the sixteenth
campea- day arrived at Campeachy. There the natives re-

y ceived them more hospitably; but the Spaniards

were much surprised, that on all the extensive coast
along which they had failed, and which they ima-
gined to be a large island, they had not observed
any river . As their water began to fail, they ad-
vanccd, in hopes of finding a supply; and at length
they dilcovered the motith of a river at Poton-
chan, tonie leagues beyond Campeachy.

killed upon the spot, and one man only of the whole -
body escaped unhurt. Their commander, though 's'7.
wounded in twelve different places, direted the
retreat with presence of mind equal to the courage
with which he had led them on in the engagement)
and with much difficulty they regained their ships.
After this fatal repulse, nothing remained but to
haften back to Cuba with their ihattered forces.
In their passage thither they suffered the most ex-
quifite distress for want of water, that men wounded
and sickly, shut up in small veftels, and exposed to

of heightening the merit of their own exploits, were
more than sufficient to excite romantic hopes and
expectations. Great numbers offered to engage
in a new expedition. Velasquez, solicitous to dif-
tinguilh himself by some service so meritorious as
might entitle him to claim the government of Cuba
independent of the admiral, not only encouraged
their ardour, but at his own expence fitted out four
ships for the voyage. Two hundred and forty
volunteers, among whom were several persons of
rank and fortune, embarked in this enterprise.
The command of it was given to Juan de Grijalva,
a young man of known merit and courage, with
inftruftions to observe attentively the nature of the
countries which he should discover, to barter for
gold, and, if circumstances were inviting, to fettle a

men who had been slain there, concurred with their '1'
ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, '51s-
that they might chastise the Indians of that diftri&
with such exemplary rigour, as would strike terror
into all the people around them. But though they
disembarked all their troops, and carried ashore
some field, pieces, the Indians fought with such
courage, that the Spaniards gained the vi&ory
with difficulty, and were confirmed in their opinion
that the inhabitants of this country would prove
more formidable enemies than any they had met
with in other parts of America. From Poton-
chan, they continued their voyage towards the weft,
keeping as near as poflible to the shore, and casting
anchor every evening, from dread of the dangerous
accidents to which they might be exposed in an
unknown sea. During the day, their eyes were
turned continually towards land, with a mixture of
surprise and wonder at the beauty of the country,
as well as the novelty of the obje&ts which they be-
held. Many villages were scattered along the coast,
in which they could diftinguilh houses of stone that
appeared white and lofty at a distance. In the
warmth of their admiration, they fancied these to be
cities adorned with towers and pinnacles; and one
of the soldiers happening to remark that this coun-
try resembled Spain in its appearance, Grijalva,
with universal applause, called it New Spain, the

They were extremely fond of trading with their
new vifirants, and in fix days the Spaniards obtained
ornaments of gold, of curious workmanship, to the
value of fifteen thousand pelbs, in exchange for
European toys of finall price. The two prisoners
whom Cordova had brought from Yucatan, had
hitherto served as interpreters; but as they did not
understand the language of this country, the Spa-

Alvarado, he himself, with the remaining vessels,

corrupted by the heat of the climate, as to be al-
most unfit for use; they had loft some men by
death; others were sickly; the country was crowded
with people who seemed to be intelligent as well as
brave; and they were under the government of
one powerful monarch, who could bring them to

plant a colony under so many circumstances ofdif-
advantage, appeared a scheme too perilous to be
attempted. Grijalva, though pofhefled both of am-
bition and courage, was destitute of the superior
talents capable of f)rming or executing such a great
plan. Hie judged it more prudent to return to
Cuba, having fulfilled the purpose of his voyage,

From Potonchan they had pursued their course for _
many hundred miles along a coast formerly unex- s318'
plored, stretching at first towards the weft, and
then turning to the north; all the country which
they had discovered appeared to be no less valuable
than extensive. As soon as Alvarado reached Cu-
ba, Velasquez, transported with success so far be-
yond his most sanguine expectations, immediately
dispatched a person of confidence to carry this im-
portant intelligence to Spain, to exhibit the rich
productions of the countries which had been dif-
covered by his means, and to solicit such an in-
crease of authority as might enable and encourage
him to attempt the conquest of them. Without
waiting for the return of his meflfnger, or for the
arrival of Grijalva, of whom he was become so
jealous or distrustful that he resolved no longer to
employ him, he began to prepare such a powerful
armament, as might prove equal to an enterprise of
so much danger and importance.

was now intent, terminated in conquests of greater
moment than what the Spaniards had hitherto at-
chieved, and led them to the knowledge of a peo-

which to me appear unanswerable. Ramufio has accom-
panied his tr;inflation of this curious voyage with a differ-
tation tending to illuflrate it. Racolte de Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 112. M. de Bougainville has, with great learning and

according to the mode of ancient navigation, undertook
this voyage in finall vcls, so coiilruclcd, that he could
keep close in with the coalt. Ile fuiled from Gades to the
island of Cerne in twelve days. This is probably what is
known to the moderns by the name of the ifc of Arguim.
It became the chicf flation of the Carthaginians on that
coalt; and M. de Bougainville contends, that the ciflcrns
found there are nmonumtnts of the Carthaginian power
and ingenuity. Proceeding from Cerne, and fill follow-
ing the winding of the coait, he arrived, in seventeen days,
at a promontory which lhe called ThIe IVy.el Horn, probably
Cape Palmas. From this he advanced to another pro-
montory, which he named The South 1iornm and which is
inanifeftly Cape de Tres Puntas, about live degrees north
of the line. All the circumstances contained in tile fliort
abflrad of his journal, which is handed down to us, con-
cerning the appearance and state of the countries on the
coast of Africa, are confirmed and illustrated by a com-
parison with the accounts of modern navigators. Even

bility, lhavL been produced'to invalidate the credibility of
his relation, tcend to confirm it. lie obfcrvcs, that in the
country to the south of Cerne, a profound silence reigned

through

through the day; but during the night innumerable fires
were kindled along the banks of the rivers, and the air
resounded with the noise of pipes and drums, and cries
of joy. The fame thing, as Ramufio obfcrves, till takes
place. The excessive heat obliges the negroes to take
flielter in the woods, or in their houses, during the day.
As soon as the fun sets, they sally out, and by torch-light
enjoy the pleasure of music and dancing, in which they

What occurred to M. Adlanfon, on the fame coast, may
explain this: " As soon," fays he, " as the fun dipped
beneath the horizon, and night overspread the earth with
darkness, the sea lent us its friendly light. While the
prow of our vcffel ploughed the foaming surges, it fcemcd
to set them all on fire. Thus we failed in a luminous
inclofurc, which surrounded us like a large circle of rays,
from whence darted in the wake of the flip a long Ifream

the sea observed by Hunter, has been mentioned as an

When Alexander marchcd along the banks of the Hy-

the Hydafpes to Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. Io2o.
This amazing error did not arise from any ignorance of
geography peculiar to that monarch; for we are informed
by Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular atten-
tion in order to acquire the knowledge of this science,
and had accurate maps or descriptions of the countries
through which he marched. Lib. ii. p. 120. But in his

T is probable that the ancients were seldom induced to
advance so far as the mouth of the Ganges, either by

motives of curiosity, or views of commercial advantage.
In consequence of this, their idea concerning the position
of that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places
that branch of the Ganges which he diftinguiflles by the
name of the Great Mouth, in the hundred and forty-fixth
degree of longitude from his first meridian in the Fortu-
nate Islands. But its true longitude, computed from that
meridian, is now determined by altronomical obferva.
tions to be only a hundred and five degrees. A geogra-

phcr so eminent must have been betrayed into an error of
this magnitude by the imperfecion of the information
which lie had received concerning those distant regions;
and this aflbrds a flriking proof of the intercourse with
them being extremely rare. With refpe& to the coun-
tries of India beyond the Ganges, his irtelligence was fill
mnore defe&ivc, and his errors more enormous. I flall

placed the country of tile Seres, or China, no less than

ports but, in a considerable part of that great continent,
they have done little more than survey its coasts, and
mark its capes and harbours. Its interior regions are in
a great measure unknown. The ancients, who had a very
imperfe& knowledge of its coasts, except where they are
waihed by the Mediterranean or Red Sea, were accuf-
tomcd to penetrate into its inland provinces, and, if we
may rely on the testimony of Herodotus and Diodorus
Siculus, had explored many parts of it now altogether
unknown. Unlcfs both modes of discovery be united,
the geographical knowledge of the earth must remain

iir. notion of the ancients concerning such an ex-
ceflive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rcn-

dered it uninhabitable, and their persisting in this error
long after they began to have some commcrcial i:;tcr-
course with fcveral parts of India lying within the tropics,
must appear so singular and absurd, that it may not be
unacceptable to some of my readers to produce ceidence
of their holding this opinion, and to account for the ap-
parent inconfitRence of their theory with their experience.
Cicero, who had bellowed attention upon every part of
philosophy known to the ancients, seems to have believed
that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, and, of confe-
quencc, that there could be no intercourse between the
northern and southern temperate zones. Ie introduces
Africanus thus addressing the younger Scipio: " You fee
this earth encompassed, and as it were bound in by certain
zones, of which, two, at the grcateft diflance from each
other, and fuRaining the opposite poles of heaven, are
frozen with perpetual colil i the middle one, and the

largest

largcft of all, is burnt with the heat of the fun; two are
habitable, the people in the southern one are antipodes
to us, with whom we have no connetion." Somnium
Scipitonit, c. 6. Geminus, a Greek philofopber, contem-
porary with Cicero, delivers the fame docrine, not in a
popular work, but in his Elteaycr n is qavpvao,t a treatise
purely scientific. "' When we speak," fays he, " of the
southern temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and con-
cerning those who are called antipodes, it must be always
understood, that we have no certain knowledge or inform-
ation concerning the southern temperate zone, whether it
be inhabited or not. But from the spherical figure of the
earth, and the course which the fun holds between the
tropics, we conclude that there is another zone, situated
to the south, which enjoys the fame degree of tempera-
ture with the northern one which we inhabit." Cap. xiii.

vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturalist, with refpea
to both these points, was the fame: " There are five di-
visions of the earth, which are called zones. All that
portion which lies near to the two opposite poles is op-
pressed with vehement cold, and eternal frost. There,
unblest with the aspeCt of milder stars, perpetual darkness
reigns, or at the utmost a feeble light refle&ed from fur-
rounding snows. The middle of the earth, in which is
the orbit of the fun, is scorched and burnt up with flames
and fiery vapour. Between these torrid and frozen dif-
tries lie two other portions of the earth, which are tem-
perate; but, on account of the burning region inter-
posed, there can be no communication between them;
Thus Heaven has deprived us of three parts of the
earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers his opinion to the
fame effect, in terms no less explicit: (" The portion of

the

the earth which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone,
is rendered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. 154. To
these I might add the authority of many other refpeaable
philosophers and historians of antiquity.

IN order to explain the sense in which this dotrine

was generally received, we may observe, that Parmenides,
as we are informed by Strabo, was the first who divided
the earth into five zones, and he extended the limits of
the zone which he supposed to be uninhabitab!e on ac-
count of heat, beyond the tropics. Aristotle, as we learn
likewise from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the different
zones in the fame manner as they are defined by modern
geographers. But the progress of discovery having gra-
dually demonstrated that several regions of the earth which
lay within the tropics were not only habitable, but popu-
lous and fertile, this induced later geographers to circum-
scribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not easy to as-
certain with precision the boundaries which they allotted'
to it. From a passage in Strabo, who, as far as I know,
is the only author of antiquity from whom we receive any
hint concerning this fubjcEt, I flhould conjee&ure, that
those who calculated according to the measurement of
the earth by Eratosthenes, supposed the torrid zone to
comprehend near sixteen degrees, about eight on each fide
of the equator; whereas such as followed the computa-
tion of Pofidonius allotted about twenty-four degrees, or
somewhat more than twelve degrees on each fide of the
equator to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib. ii. p. 151. Ac-
cording to the former opinion, about two-thirds of that
portion of the earth which lies between the tropics was
confidered as habitable according to the latter, about one
half of it. With this reftrifCion, the dofrine of the an-
cients concerning the torrid zone appears less absurd } and
we can conceive the realon of their aflerting this zone to

be

be uninhabitable, even after they had opened a commu-
nication with several places within the tropics. When
men of science spoke of the torrid zone, they confidered
it as it was limited by the definition of geographers to
sixteen, or at the utmost to twenty-four degrees; and as
they knew almost nothing of the countries nearer to the
equator, they might still suppose them to be uninhabit-
able. In loose and popular discourse, the name of the
torrid zone continued to be given to all that portion of
the earth which lies within the tropics. Cicero seems to
have been unacquainted with those ideas of the later geo-
graphers, anti adhcring to the division of Parmcnides,
describes tile torrid zone as the largest of the five. Some
of the ancients rejeted the notion concerning the into-
lerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular error. This,
we are told by Plutarch, was the sentiment of Pythago-
ras, and we learn from Strabo, that Eratosthenes and
Polybius hlid adopted the fame opinion, lib. ii. 154.
Ptolemy fccms to have paid no regard to the ancient doc-
trine and opinions concerning the torrid zone.

founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was only
nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees weft
from the Fortunate or Canary Ifands; and the naviga-
tion, in that direcion, was much shorter than by the
course which the Portuguese were pursuing. Marco
Polo, in his travels, had described countries, particularly
the island of Cipango or Zipangri, supposed to be Japan,
considerably to the east of any part of Asia known to the
ancients. Marcus Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii.
c. 70. lib. iii. c. 2. Of course, this country, as it ex-
tended further to the east, was still nearer to the Canary
Ilands. The conclusions of Columbus, though drawn from
inaccurate observations, were just. If the suppositions of
Marinus had been well founded, and if the countries,
which Marco Polo visited, had been situated to the caf of
those whose longitude Marinus had ascertained, the proper
and neareit course to the East Indies must have been to
steer directly weft. Herrera, dec. i. lib. i. c. 2. A more
extensive knowledge of the globe has now discovered the
great error of Marinus, in supposing China to be fifteen
hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees east from
the Canary Islands, and that even Ptolemy was mistaken,
when he reduced the longitude of China to twelve hours,
or one hundred and eighty degrees. The longitude of
the western frontier of that vast empire is seven hours,
or one hundred and fifteen degrees from the meridian of
the Canary Illands. But Columbus followed the light
which his age afforded, and relied upon the authority of
writers, who were, at that time, regarded as the in-
ltlueors and guides of mankind in the science of
gcogr;nphy.

As the Portuguese, in making their discoveries, did

not depart far from the coast of Africa, they con-

cluded that birds, whbfe flight they observed with great
attention, did not venture to any considerable distance
froni land. In the infancy of navigation, it ias not
known, that birds often stretched their flight to an im-
mense diltance from any ihore. In failing towards the
WeVft-Idian iflarids, birds arc often feet at the distance
of two htindred leagues from the nearest coast. Sloane's
Nat. Hit. of Janmaia, vol. i, p. 36. Catefby saw an owl
at sea, when the ship *as fix hindred leagues distant
from land. Nat. Hist. bs Carolina, pref. p. 7' Hist. Na-
turelle de M. Buffon, tonl. xvi. . 32. From which it
appears, that this indication of land, on which Columbus
seems to have relied with some confidence, was extremely
uncertain. This observation is confirmed by Capt. Cookl
the most extensive and experienced navigator of any age
or nation. " No one yet knows (fays he) to what difb
tance any of the oceanic birds go to sea for my own
parts I do not believe that there is one in the wholetribe
that can be relied on in pointing out the vicinity of land."

·N a letter of the admiral's to Ferdinand and tfabellaj

he describes one of the harbours in Cuba, with all the

enthusiastic admiration of a discoverer.--" I discovered a
river which a galley might easily enter; the beauty of it
induced me to found, and I found from five to eight fa-
thoms of water. Having proceeded a considerable way
up the river, every thing invited me to fettle there. The

g 2 beauty

beauty of the river, the clearness of the water, through
which I could fee the sandy bottom, the multitude of
palm-trees of different kinds, the tallest and finest I had
seen, and an infinite number of other large and flourifbing
trees, the birds, and the verdure of the plains, are so
wonderfully beautiful, that this country excels all others
as far as the day surpasses the night in brightness and
splendour, so that I often said, that it would be in vain
for me to attempt to give your highnesses a full account
of it, for neither my tongue nor my pen could come up
to the truth; and indeed I am so much amazed at the
fight of such beauty, that I know not how to describe
it." Life of Columb. c. 30.

NOTE XV. p. 27.
T H account which Columbus gives of the huma-

nity and orderly behaviour of the natives on this

occasion is very striking. " The king (fays he, in a let-
ter to Ferdinand and Isabella) having been informed of
our misfortune, expressed great grief for our loss, and
immediately sent aboard all the people in the place in
man)flarge canoes; we soon unloaded the ship of every
thing that was upon deck, as the king gave us great
affifance: he himself, with his brothers and relations,
took all poflible care that every thing lhould be properly
done, both aboard and on shore. And, from time to
time, he sent some of his relations weeping, to beg of me
hot to be dejeted, for he would give me all that he had.
I can assure your highnesses, that so much care would not
have been taken in securing our effets in any part of
Spaiti, as all our property was put together in one place
near his palace, until the houses which he wanted to pre-
pare for the custody of it, were emptied. IIe immedi-
ately placed a guard of armed men, who watchcd during

r tthe

the whole night, and those on Oiore lamented as if they
had been much interested in our loss. The people are so
affeAtionate, so tractable, and so peaceable, that I swear
to your highnefies, that there is not a better race of men,
nor a better country in the world. They love their neigh-
bour as themselves; their conversation is the sweetest and
mildest in the world, cheerful, and always accompanied
with a smile. And although it is true that they go naked,
yet your highnesses may be afflured that they have many
very commendable customs; the king is served with great
slate, and his behaviour is so decent, that it is pleasant to
fee him, as it is likewise to observe the wonderful me.
mory which there people have, and their desire of knowing
every thing, which leads them to inquire into its caufea
and effets." Life of Columbus, c. 32. It is probable,
that the Spaniards were indebted for this officious atten-
tion, to the opinion which the Indians entertained of them
as a superior order of beings,

E VERY monument of such a man as Columbus is

valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdinand

and Isabella, describing what palsed on this occasion, ex-
hibits a molt striking picure of his intrepidity, his hu.
manity, his prudence, his public spirit, and courtly ad.
dress. 9" I would have been lecs concerned for this mif-
fortune, had I alone been in danger, both because my life
is a debt that I owe to the Supreme Creator, and because
I have at other times been exposed to the most imminent
hazard. But what gave me infinite grief and vexation
was, that after it had pleased our Lord to give me faith to
undertake this enterprise, in which I had now been so fuc.
cefsful, that my opponents would have been convinced,

and the glory of your highnefcs, and the extent of your
territory increased by me; it ihould please the Divine
Majesty to Rfp all by my death. All this would
have been more tolerable, had it not been attended with
the loss of those men whom I had carried with me, upon
promise of the greatest prosperity, who feeing themselves
in such distress, cursed not only their coming along with
me, but that fear and awe of me, which prevented them
from returning as they often had resolved to have done,
But besides all this, my sorrow was greatly increased, by
recollecing that I had left my two sons at school at Cor-
dova, destitute of friends, in a foreign country, when it
could not in all probability be known that I had done such
services as might induce your highnefres to remember
them. And though I comforted myself with the faith
that our Lord would not permit that, which tended so
much to the glory of his church, and which I had brought
about with so much trouble, to remain imperfect, yet I
confidered, that on account of my fins, it was his will to
deprive me of that glory, which I might have attained in
this world. While in this confused slate, I thought on
the good fortune which accompanies your highnesses, and
imagined, that although I Chould perish, and the veflel be
loft, it was poflible that you might somehow come to the
knowledge of my voyage, and the success with which it
was attended. For that reason I wrote upon parchment
with the brevity which the situation required, that I had
discovered the lands which I promised, in how many days
I had done it, and what course I had followed. I men-
tioned the goodncfs of the country, the charater of the
inhabitants, anld that your higneffes fubjcds were left in
pofliflon of all that I had discovered. Having fealed
this writing, I aiddrciTed it to your highnef'es, and pro-
mifed a thousand ducats to any person who should deliver

it

it fealed, so that if any foreigners found it, the promrifed
reward might prevail on them not to give the information
to another. I then caused a great calk to be brought to
me, and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and
afterwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the cask, and
having ftopt it well, I cast it into the sea. All the men
believed that it was tome a. of devotion. Imagining
that this might never chance to be taken up, as the ships
approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like
the first, and placed it at the top of the poop, so that if the
(hip funk, the calk remaining above water might be com-
mitted to the guidance of fortune."

NOTE XVII. p. 140.
SOME Spanish authors, with the meanness of national

jealousy, have endeavoured to detra& from the glory

of Columbus, by insinuating that he was led to the disco-
vcry of the New World, not by his own inventive or
enterprising genius, but by information which he had re-
ccived. According to their account, a veflel having been
driven from its coutfe by easterly winds, was carried be-
fore them far to the weft, and landed on the coast of an
unknown country, from which it returned with difficulty;
the pilot, and three sailors, being the only persons who
survived the diftrefles which the crew suffered, from want
of provisions, and fatigue in this long voyage. In a few
days after their arrival, all the four died; but the pilot
having been received into the house of Columbus, his in-
timate friend, disclosed to him, before his death, the fe-
cret of the discovery which he had accidentally made, and
left him his papers containing a journal of the voyage,
which served as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking.
(;omara, as far as I know, is the first author who publifli-

Y4 ed

ed this story, Hist. c. 13. Every circumstance is defti.
tute of evidence to support it. Neither the name of the
veficl nor its destination is known. Some pretend that it
belonged to one of the sea-port towns in Andalusia, and
was failing either to the Canaries, or to Madeira; others,
that it was a Bifcayner in its way to England; others, a
Portuguese Ihip trading on the coast of Guinea. The
name of the pilot is alike unknown, as well as that of the
port in which he landed on his return. According to
some, it was in Portugal; according to others, in Madei-
ra, or the Azores. The year in which this voyage was
made is no less uncertain. Monfon's Nav. Tracs.
Churchill, iii. 371. No mention is made of this pilot or
his discoverics, by And. Bernaldes, or Pet. Martyr, the
contemporaries of Columbus. Herrera, with his usual
judgment, passes over it in silence. Oviedo takes notice
of this report, but confiders it as a tale fit only to amuse the
vulgar. Hist. lib. ii. c. 2. As Columbus held his course
directly weft from the Canaries, and never varied it, some
later authors have supposed, that this uniformity is a proof
bs his being guided by some previous information. But
they do not recolle& the principles on which he founded
all his hopes of success, that by holding a westerly course,
he mufl certainly arrive at those regions of the east de-
rcribed by the ancients. His firm belief of his own system
led him to take that course, and to pursue it without
deviation.

THE Spaniards are not the only people who have called

in question Columbus's claim to the honour of having dif.
covered America. Some German authors ascribe this
honour to Martin Behaim, their countryman. He was
of the noble family of the Behaims of Schwartzbach, citi-
zens of the first rank in the Imperial town of Nuremberg.

Hlaving

Having studied under the celebrated John Muller, better
known by the name of Regiomontanus, he acquired such
knowledge of cosmography, as excited a desire of exploring
those regions, the ftuation and qualities of which he had
been accustomed, under that able master, to investigate
and describe. Under the patronage of the Duchess of
Burgundy he repaired to Lisbon, whither the fame of the
Portuguese discoveries invited all the adventurous spirits of
the age. There, as we learn from Herman Schedel, of
whofc Chronicon Mtndi a German translation was printed
at Nuremberg A. D. 1493, his merit as a cosmographer
raised him, in conjuntion with Diego Cano, to the com-
mand of a squadron fitted out for discovery in the year
1483. In that voyage, he is said to have discovered the
kingdom of Congo. He fettled in the island of Fayal, one
of the Azores, and was a particular friend of Columbus.
Herrera, dec. i. lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terrestrial
globe made by Behaim, on which he demonstrated the
course that he purposed to hold in search of the commu-
nication with the South Sea, which he afterwards disco-
vered. Gomara Hist. c. 19. Herrera, dec. I . lib. ii.
c. 19. In the year 1492, Behaim visited his relations in
Nuremberg, and left with them a map drawn with his
own hand, which is still preserved among the archives of
the family. Thus far the story of Martin Behaim seems
to be well authenticated; but the account of his having
discovered any part of the New World appears to be
merely conjectural.

IN the first edition, as I had at that time hardly any

knowledge of Behaim but what I derived from a frivolous
Dissertation de vero Novi Orbis Inventore, published at
Francfort, A. D. 1714, by Jo. Frid. Stuvenius, I was in.
duced, by the authority of Hcrrera, to suppose that Behaim

was

was not a native of Germany; but from more full and ac-
curate information, communicated to me by the learned
Dr. John Reinold Forster, I am now satisfied that I was
mistaken. Dr. Forfer has been likewise so good as to fa-
vour me with a copy of Behaim's map, as publithed by
Doppelmayer in his account of the Mathematicians and
Artists of Nuremberg. From this map, the imperfeation
of cosmographical knowledge at that period is manifest.
Hardly one place is laid down in its true fituatiou. Nor
can I discover from it any reason to suppose that Behaim
had the least knowledge of any region in America. He
delineates, indeed, an island to which he gives the name
of St. Brandon. This, it is imagined, may be some part
of Guiana, supposed at first to be an island. He places it
in the fame latitude with the Cape Verd isles, and I fufpec
it to be an imaginary island which has been admitted into
some ancient maps on no better authority than the legend
of the Irish St. Brandon or Brendan, whose flory is so
childishly fabulous as to be unworthy of any notice. Gi-
rald. Cambricnis ap. Miflingham Florilegium Santorum,

THE prctenfions of the Welsh to the discovery of Ame-

rica seem not to reft on a foundation much more solid. In
the twelfth century, according to Powell, a dispute having
arisen among the sons of Owen Guyneth, king of North.
Wales, concerning the fucceflion to his crown, Madoc,
one of their number, weary of this contention, betook him-
self to sea in qucft of a more quiet settlement. He steered
due weft, leaving Ireland to the north, and arrived in an
unknown country, which appeared to him so desirable,
that he returned to Wales, and carried thither several of
his adherents and companions. This is said to have hap-
pened about the year 1170, and after that, he and his co.

lony

lony were heard of no more. But it is to be observed,
that Powell, on whose testimony the authenticity of this
Rory refts, published his history above four centuries from
the date of the event which he relates. Among a people
as rude and as illiterate as the Welsh at that period, the
memory of a tranfaEion so remote must have been very
imperfectly preserved, and would require to be confirmed
by some author of greater credit, and nearer to the era of
Madoc's voyage than Powell. Later antiquaries have in-
deed appealed to the testimony of Meredith ap Rhees, a
Welsh bard, who died A. D. 1477. But he too lived at
such a distance of time from the event, that he cannot be
confidered as a witness of much more credit than Powell.
Besides, his verses, published by Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 1.
convey no information, but that Madoc, difratisfied with
his domestic situation, employed himself in searching the
ocean for new pofleffions. But even if we admit the au-
thenticity of Powell's story, it does not follow that the
unknown country which Madoc discovered by fleering
weft, in such a course as to leave Ireland to the north,
was any part of America. The naval Ikill of the Wel(h
in the twelfth century was hardly equal to such a voyage.
If he made any discovery at all, it is more probable that
it was Madeira, or some other of the western isles. The
affinity of the Welsh language with Come diale&s spoken
in America, has been mentioned as a circumstance which
confirms the truth of Madoc's voyage. But that affinity
has been observed in so few instances, and in some of
these is so obscure, or so fanciful, that no conclusion can
be drawn from the casual resemblance of a small number
of words. There is abird, which, as far as is yet known,
is found only on the coasts of South America, from Port
Desire to the Straits of Magellan. It is diltinguifhed by
fle name of Penguin. This word in the Welfli language

fignifie

signifies White-head. Almost all the authors who favour
the pretensions of the Welsh to the discovery of America,
mention this as an irrefragable proof of the affinity of the
Welsh language with that spoken in this region of Ame-
rica. But Mr. Pennant, who has given a scientific defcrip-.
tion of the Penguin, observes, that all the birds of this
genus have black heads, " so that we must resign every
hope (adds he) founded on this hypothesis of retrieving
the Cambrian race in the New World." Philof. TranfaEt.
vol. lviii. p. 9;, &c. Beside this, if the Welsh, towards
the close of the twelfth century, had fettled in any part of
America, some remains of the Chriltian doctrine and rites
mult have been found among their descendants, when
they were discovered about three hundred years posterior
to their migration; a period so short, that, in the course
of it, we cannot well suppose that all European ideas and
arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttelton, in his
notes to the fifth book of his History of Henry II. p. 3 7 .
has examined what Powell relates concerning the disco-
veries made by Madoc, and invalidates the truth of his
story by other arguments of great weight.

TI-XE pretensions of the Norwegians to the discovery of

America, seem to be better founded than those of the
Germans or Wel(h. The inhabitants of Scandinavia were
remarkable in the middle ages for the boldness and extent
of their maritime excursions. In 874, the Norwegians
discovered, and planted a colony in Iceland. In 982,
they discovered Greenland, and eftablifbed settlements
there. From that, Come of their navigators proceeded
towards the weft, and discovered a country more inviting
than those horrid regions with which they were acquainted.
According to their representation, this country was sandy
on the coasts, but in the interior parts level and covered

with

with wood, on which account they gave it the name of
Helle-land, and MAark-land, and having afterwards found
some plants of the vine which bore grapes, they called it
Win-land. The credit of this story refts, as far as I know,
on the authority of the saga, or chronicle of king Olaus,
composed by Snorro Sturlonides, or Sturlufonr, published
by Perinfkiold at Stockholm A. D. 1697. As Snorro was
born in the year I179, his chronicle might be compiled
about two centuries after the event which he relates. His
account of the navigation and discoveries of Biorn, and
his companion Lief, is a very rude confused tale, p. 104.
10. 326. It is impofible to discover from him, what
part of America it was in which the Norwegians landed.
According to his account of the length of the days and
nights, it must have been .as far north as the fifty-eighth
degree of latitude, on some part of the coast of Labradore,
approaching near to the entry of Hudson's Straits. Grapes,
certainly, are not the producion of that country. Torfeus
supposes that there is an error in the text, by recifying of
which, the place where the Norwegians landed may be
supposed to be situated in latitude 49°. But neither is
that the region of the vine in America. From pctufing
Snorro's tale, I should think that the situation of New-
foundland corresponds best with that of the country dif-
covered by the Norwegians. Grapes, however, are not
the produ&ion of that barren island. Other conjectures
are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. a 1'Hiit. de Dcnnem.
175, &c. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the lite-
rature of the north, to examine them. It seems manifest,
that if the Norwegians did discover any part of America
at that period, their attempts to plant colonies proved
unfuccefaful, and all knowledge of it was soon loll.

S° firmly were men of science, in that age, persuaded

that the countries which Columbus had discovered

were connected with the East Indies, that Bernaldes, the
Cura de los Palacios, who seems to have been no incon-
fiderable proficient in the knowledge of cosmography,
contends that Cuba was not an island, but a part of the
continent, and united to the dominions of the Great
Khau. T'his he delivered as his opinion to Columbus

himself,

from his second voyage and he supports it by several ar-
guments, mostly founded on the authority of Sir John

secretary to the magistracy of Genoa towards the close of
the fifteenth century; published a short account of the
navigations and discoveries of his countryman Columbus,
annexed to his Opufcula Hiftorica de rebus populi Genu-
ensis; in which he informs us, from letters of Columbus
which he himself had seen, that it was his opinion, founded
upon nautical observations, that one of the islands he had
discovered was distant only two hours or thirty degrees
from Cattigara, which, in the chartthc geographers of
that age, was laid down, upon the I[rity of Ptolemy,
lib. vii. c. 3. as the most easterly place in Asia. From
this he concluded, that if so:ne unknown continent did
not obftru&t the navigation, there must be a ihort and easy
access, by holding a westerly course, to this extreme region
of the East. luratori Scriptores Rer. Italicarurn, vol.

C. LUMBUs seems to have formed some very singular

opinions concerning the countries which he hadnlow

discovered. The violent swell and agitation of the wa.
ters on the ooaft of Trinidad led him to conclude this to

be

be the highest part of the terraqueous globe, and he
imagined that various circumstances concurred in proving
that the sea was here visibly elevated. Having adopted
this erroneous principle, the4parent beauty of the coun-
try induced him to fall in with a notion of Sir John Man.
deville, c. 102. that the terrestrial paradise was the highest
land in the earth; and he believed that he had been so
fortunate as to discover this happy abode. Nor ought we
to think it strange that a person of so much sagacity flould
be influenced by the opinion or reports of such a fabulous
author as Mandeville. Columbus and the ether discoverers

T is jearkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo,
the most ancient Spanish historians of America, nor

Herrera, confider Ojcda, or his companion Vespucci, as
the first difcovrers of the continent of America. They
uniformly ascribe this honour to Columbus. S ave
supposed that national resentment against Vefp for
deserting the service of Spain, and entering intoit of
Portugal, may have prompted these writers to cdhceal the
a&ions which he performed. But Martyr and Benzoni,
both Italians, could not be warped by the fame prejudice.

ascribe to Vespucci the. honour of having first discovered
the continent. Benzoni went as an adventurer to Ame-

time. He appears to have been animated evith a warm
zeal for the honour of Italy, his native country, and yet
does not mention the exploits and discoveries of Vespucci-
Herrera, wr' compiled his general history of America

of both the voyages which he made to the New World,
and of confounding the one with the other, in order that
he might arrogate to himself the glory of having disco-
vered the continent. Her. dec. I. lib. iv. c. . He aflerts,

they returned dire&ly to Cadiz from the coast of Paria,
and touched at Hispaniola only in their second voyage;
and that he had finished the voyage in five months;
whereas, according to Vespucci's account, he had employ-

the year 1510, and probably sooner. Vita di Am. Vefp.

first given to the New World, is not certain.

T HE form employed on this occasion served as a model

to the Spaniards in all their fubfcquent conquests in

America. It is so extraordinary in its nature, and gives
uofuch an idea of the proceedings of the Spaniards, and
the principles upon which they founded their right to the
exsenfive dominions which they acquired in the New
World, that it well merits the attention of the reader.
at I Alonfo de Ojeda, servant of the motu high kandpower-

ful

*ful kings bs Castile and Leon, the conquerors of barbarous
nations, their messenger and captain, notify to you and
declare, in as ample form as I am capable, that God our
Lord, who is one and eternal, created the heaven and the
earth, and one man and one woman, !of whom you and
we, and all the men who have been or shall be in the
world, are descended. But as it has come to pass,
through the number of generations during more than five
-thousand years, that they have been dispersed into differ-
ent parts of the world, and are divided into various king-
doms and provinces, because one country was not able to
contain them, nor could they have found in one the means
of subsistence and preservation; therefore God our Lord
gave the charge of all those people to one man, named
St. Peter, whom he constituted the lord and head of all
the human race, that all men, in whatever place they
are born, or in whatever faith or place they are educated,
might yield obedience unto him. He hath fubjeaed the
whole world to his jurifdi&ion, and commanded him to
establish his residence in Rome, as the most proper place
for the government of the world. He likewise promised
and gave him power to ellablifh his authority in every
other part of the world, and to judge and govern all
Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and all other people,
of whatever fed or faith they maybe. To him is given
the name of Pope, which signifies admirable, great father
and guardian, because he is the father and governor of all
men. Those who lived in the time of this holy father
obeyed and acknowledged him as their lord and king, and
the superior of the universe. The fame has been observed
with refpet to them who, since his time, have been
chosen to the pontificate. Thus it now continues, and
will continue to the end of the world.

" ONE of these pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath made

a grant of these islands, and of the Tierra Firmc of the
ocean sea, to the Catholic kings of Castile, Don Ferdinand
and Donna Isabella, of glorious memory, and their fuc-
ceflors, our sovereigns, with all they contain, as is more
fully exprefled in certain deeds palTed upon that occasion,
which you may fee, if you desire it. Thus his majfty is
king and lord of there islands, and of the continent, in vir-
tue of this donation; and, as king and lord aforesaid,
mosl of the islands to which his title hath been notified,
have recognised his majesty, and now yield obedience and
fubjc&ion to him as their lord, voluntarily and without
rcfitance; and instantly as soon as they received informa-
tion, they obeyed the religious men sent by the king to
preach to them, and to inftru& them in our holy faith;
and all there, of their own free will, without any recom-
pence or gratuity, became Christians, and continue to be
so; and his majesty having received them graciouly under
his proteaion, has commanded that they should be treated
in the fame manner as his other subje&s and vaflals. You
are bound and obliged to aa in the fame manner. There-
fore I now entreat and require you to confider attentively
what I have declared to you; and that you may more per-
fe&ly comprehend it, that you take such time as is reason-
able, in order that you may acknowledge the Church as the
superior and guide of the universe, and likewise the holy
father called the Pope, in his own right, and his majesty
by his appointment, as king and sovereign lord of these
islands, and of the Ticrra Firm ; and that you consent that
the aforesaid holy fathers (hall declare and preach to you
the dotrincs above mentioned. If you do this, you at
well, and perform that to which you are bound and oblig-
ed; and his majesty, and I in his name, will receive you
with love and kindness, and will leave you, your wives and

children,

children, free and exempt from servitude, and in the en-
joyment of all you possess, in the fame manner as the in-
habitants of the islands. Besides this, his majesty will
bestow upon you many privileges, exemptions, and re-
wards. But if you will not comply, or maliciously delay
to obey my injunction, then, with the help of God, I will
enter your country by force, I will carry on war against
you with the utmost violence, I will subje&t you to the
yoke of obedience to the church and the king, I will take
your wives and children, and will make them slaves, and
fell or dispose of them according to his majesty's pleasure;
I will seize your goods, and do you all the mischief in my
power, as rebellious fubjets, who will not acknowledge
or submit to their lawful sovereign. And I protest, that
all the bloodshed and calamities which shall follow are to be
imputed to you, and not to his majesty, or to me, or the
gentlemen who serve under me; and as I have now made
this declaration and requisition unto you, I require the no-
tary here present to grant me a certificate of this, subscribed
in proper form." Herrera, dec. i. lib. vii. c. 14.

BALBOA, in his letter to the king, observes, that of the

hundred and ninety men whom he took with him,

there were never above eighty fit for service at one time.
So much did they fuffcr from hunger, fatigue, and
sickness. Herrera, dec. x. lib. x. c. 16. P. Mart.

F ONSECA, bishop of Palencia, the principal direaor of

American affairs, had eight hundred Indians in pro-

perty; the commendator Lope de Conchillos, his chief
associate in that department, eleven, hundred; and other
favourites had considerable numbers. They feat overseers
to the islands, and hired out those slaves to the planters.

T HOUGH America is more plentifully supplied *itl

water than the other regions of the globe, there is no

river or fream of water in Yucatan. This peninsula
projecs from the continent a hundred leagues, but, where
broadest, does not extend above twenty-five leagues. It
is an extensive plain, not only without mountains, but al-
most without any inequality of ground. The inhabitants
arc supplied with water from pits, and wherever they dig
them, find it in abundance. It is probable, from all
those circumstances, that this country was formerly co-
vered by the sea. Herrerae Defcriptio India: Occidentalis,

NOTE XXVII. p. 306.
M. CLAVIGERO censures me for having reprerented the

Spaniards who failed with Cordova and Grijalva,

as fancying, in the warmth of their imagination, that they
saw cities on the coaa of Yucatan adorned with towers
and cupolas. I know not what translation of my history

he

lie has copfulted, (for his quotation from it is not taken
from the original,) but I never imagined that any build-
ing erected by Americans could fuggell the idea of a cu-
pola or dome, a structure which their utmost Ikill in ar-
chiteclure was incapable of rearing. My words are, that
they fancied the villages which they fiw from their ships
"( to be cities adorned with towers and pinacles." By
pinacles I meant some elevation above the reft of the build-
ing; and the pa(fage is translated almost literally from
lHcrrera, dec. 2. lib. iii. c. i. In almost all the accounts
of new countries given by the Spanifi discoverers in that
age, this warmth of admiration is conspicuous; and led
them to describe these new objelcs in the most splendid
terms. When Cordova and his companions first beheld
an Indian village of greater magnitude than any they had
beheld in the islands, they dignified it by the name of
Grand Cairo, B. Diaz. c. 2. From the fame cause Gri-
jalva and his aflbciates thought the country along the coast
of which they held their courfc, entitled to the name of
New Spain.
