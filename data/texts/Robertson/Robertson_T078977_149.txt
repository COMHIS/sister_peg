FIRST EDIT I0 ON,
T DELIVERS this book to the world with all the difi-

. dencc and anxiety natural to an author on pub-
lifliing his sirs- performance. The time I have
employed, and thei pains I have taken, in order to
render it worthy of the public approbation, it is,
perhaps, prudent to conceal, until it be known
vwhcther that approbation flall evcr be bestowed
upon it.

Bur as I have departed, in many inflances, from

former lhiforians, as I have placcd fasts in a difteirent
igilt, and have drawn characrcrs with new colours, ]
oughIt to account for this conduc to my readers; and
to produce the evidence, on which, at the dif-ance of

A 2 two

two centuries, I presume to contradict the tefimony
of less remote, or even of contemporary hiitorians.

THE tranfadtions in Mary's reign gave rife to two

parties, which were animated againfi each other with
the fiercest political hatred, cmbittered by religious
zeal. Each of these produced historians of confider-
able merit, who adopted all their sentiments, and
defended all their ations. Truth was not the sole
objec& of these authors. Blinded by prejudices, and
heated by the part which they themselves had acted
in the fccncs they describe, they wrote an apology for
a facion, rather than the hillory of their country.
Succeeding Historians have followed these guides
almost implicitly, and have repeated their errors and
misrepresentations. But as the fame paflions which
inflamed parties in that age have descended to their
posterity; as almofl every event in Mary's reign has
become the objed of doubt or of dispute; the eager
spirit of controversy soon discovered, that without
some evidence more authentic and more impartial than
that of such Historians, none of the points in quefiion
could be decided with certainty. Records have there-
fore been searched, original papers have been pro-

duced,
l^.;. .

duced, and public archives, as well as the repositories
of private men, have been ransacked by the zeal and
curiosity of writers of different -};rties. The attention
of Cecil to collect whatever related to that period, in
which he acred so conspicuous a part, hath providced
such an immense fore of original papers foi ilhi-uraning
this part of the English and Scottifil hiitory, as are
almof: sufficient to satisfy the utmofR av-idity ol an
Antiquarian. Sir Robert Cotton (whose library is
now the property of the Public) made great and va-
luable additions to Cecil's collection; and from this
magazine, Digges, the compilers of the Cabala, An-
derfon, Keith, Haines, Sorbes, have drawn i-mol of
the papers which they have printed. No History of
Scotland, that merits any degree of attention, has
appeared since these colleions were published. By
consulting them, I have been enabled, in many in-
flances, to corre& the inaccuracies of former -ifto-
rians, to avoid their mirtakes, and to detect their
misrepresentations.

BUT many important papers have escaped the notice

of those industrious Colledors, and after all they have
produced to light, much flill remained in darkness,

5 ~ i-iunobferved

unobfcrved or unpublifced. It was my duty to
fcarch for these, and I found this unpleasant task
attended with considerable utility.

THE library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edin-

burgh, contains not only a large collection of original
papers relating to the affairs of Scotland, but copies
of others no less curious, which have been preserved
by Sir Robert Cotton, or are extant in the Public
Offices in England. Of all these the Curators of
that library were pleased to allow me the perusal.

THOUGH the Britifi Mufxzum be not yet open to

the Public, Dr. Birch, whose obliging disposition is
well known, procured me access to that noble col-
lesaion, which is worthy the magnificence of a great
and polished nation.

THAT vant and curious colledion of papers relating

to the rcign of Elizabeth, which was made by Dr.
Sorbes, and of which he published only two volumes,
having been purchased Lince his death by the Lord
Viscount Royflon, his Lordflip was so good as to
allow me the use of fourteen volumes in quarto, con-

taining

taining that part of them which is conneted with
my fubje&.

SIR Alexander Dick communicated to mc very

valuable colledion of original papers, in two large
volumes. They relate chiefly to the reign of James.
Many of them are marked with Archbishop Spotif-
wood's hand; and it appears from several paflages
in his history, that he had perused them with great
attention.

MR. Callerwood, an eminent Presbyterian Clergy-

man of the last century, compiled an liitory of Scot-
land from the beginning of the reign of James V. to
the death of James VI. in fix large volumes: wherein.
he has inserted many papers of consequence, which
are no where else to be found. This I-ficory has not
been publiflled, but a copy of it, which Rill remains
in manuscript, in the poffefion of the church of
Scotland, was put into my hands by my worthy friend
the Reverend Doctor George Wifhart, principal Clerk
of the church.

SIR David Dalrympile not only communicated to rme
dte papers whiclh Ie has colleced relating to Gowric's

conf3iracy v

cons'piracy; but, by explaining to me his sentiments
with regard to that problematical pafiage in the
Scottish hifory, has enabled me to place that tranf-
an-ion in a light which dispels much of the darkness
and confusion in which it has been hitherto involved.

MR. Goodall, though he knew my sentiments with

regard to the condu& and characer of Queen Mary
to be cxtremely different from his own, communicated
to me a volume of manuscripts in his pofiefion,
which contains a great number of valuable papers
copied from the originals in the Cottonian Library
and Paper office, by the late Reverend Mr. Crawford,
Regius Profeifor of Church Hiflory in the University
of Edinburgh. I likewise received from him the
original Register of letters kept by the Regent Lennox
during his administration.

I HAVE consulted all these papers, as far as I

thought they could be of any use towards illuslating
that period of which I write the history. With
what success I have employed them to confirml what
was already known, to ascertain what was dubious,
or to determine what was controverted, the Public
must judge.

I MIGHT

I lMIGHT cafily havc drawn, iflrom the difi7rc'nt rcpo-

fitorics to which I had accef,, as many papers as
would have rcndcced my Appendix cqual in fizc to
the mofI bulky collieioni ors ry prcdcccflors. iBut
I have fatislied myself \with publifilin; a ifew of thle
imofi curious among tlelm, to whiich I found it nc-
ceflary to appeal as vouchlers for my own veracity.
None of1 tlihci, as flr as I cal recollcC, cver appeared
in anry former collcdiion.

TO THE

ELEVENTH EDITION°
IT is now twenty-eight years since I publifed the

Hiflory of Scotland. During that time I have

been favoured by ny friends with several remarks
upon it; and various ftridures have been made by
persons, who entertained sentiments different from
mine, with rel)ct to thle tranfaiions in the reign
of Qucen Mary. From whatever quarter information
came, in whatever mode it has been commlunicated, I
have confidcred it calmly and with attention. Wherc-
evcr I perceived that I had erred, either in relating
events, or in delineating cha-racers, I have, without
hesitation, correcld those errors. Wherever I am
satisfied that my original ideas were just and well-

6 founded,

foundlcd, I adhere to them ; and rerling upon their
conformity to evidence already produced, I enter
into no difcuifion or controversy in order to support
them. Wherever the opportunity of consulting ori-
ginal papers either in print or in manuscript, to which
I had not formerly access, has enabled me throw new
light upon any part of the I-iilcory, hlave made
alterations and additions, which, I flatter myself, will
be found to be of tome importance.

ConIl/ainig a Review of the SCO'r'iTsI-I Hif¥-oOy previozus

to the death of JAMES V.
I H- E si irfl ages of the Scottifll history are dark and fabulous. 1 o K

Nations, as well as men, arrive at maturity by degrees,

and the events, which happened during their infancy or early iatl,,h'rl'o-l
youth, cannot be recolledced, and dfcllrve not to be remember- lus u1nd ob-
ed. The gross ignorance which anciently covered all the Nortl
of Europe, the continual migrations of its inhabitants, and the
frequent and deftrutive revolutions vwhich these occasioned, render
it impoflible to give any authentic account of the origin of the
different kingdoms now eftablifled there. Every thing beyond
that fliort period to which well-attefted annals reach, is obscure;
an immense space is left for invention to occupy; each nation,
with a vanity infreparable from humaln nl.ature, hath filled that void

Origin of th TIlE Scots carry their pretcnfions to antiqitiy as high as any- of
S'OS'" th-eir neighlbours. Relying up1on Lunccrtain legends, and the tradi-

tions of their bards, f.ill more uncertain, they- reckon up a ferice
of kings ieveral ages before the birth of Chlriit; and give a parti-
cular detail of the occurrences wlich happened in their reigns.
But with regard to tlie Scots, as w-ell as the other noithelrn nation-,
w\e receive tle earlie:i accounis on which we can depend, not from
A.D. s. their own, but f-oi'm the Roman autihors. M\len the Romans,

under Agricola, lirft carried their arms into the northern parts of
Britain, they found it pofTefled by the Caledonians, a fierce and
warlike people; and having repu!ll;el, rather than conquered them,
they erected a firong wall between the firths of Forth and Clyde,
and there fixed the boundaries of their empire. Adrian, on ac-
count of the difficulty of defending fucl a difant frontier, con-
A. D. ,t=. traded the limits of the Roman province in Britain, by building a

Iecond wall, which ran between Newcafile and Carliflc. The
ambition of fuccceding Emperors endeavoured to recover what
Adrian had abandoned; and the country between the twvo walls was
alternately under tle dominion of the Romans,; and that of the
Caledonians. About the beginning of the fifth century, the in-
roads of the Goths and other Barbarians obliged the Romans, in
order to defend the centrc of their empire, to recal those legions
vwhich guarded the frontier provinces; and at that time they quitted
all their conquests in Britain.

NORTTII BRITAIN Wvasl, th ir rctreat, left under the donin;lion

of the Scots and P'its. iThe ilrmer, who are not mincitionci1d by
any Roman author before the end of tle lourth century, w\ere prto-
bably a colony of the Cclt.e or Ciauls: Their alinity to v.hloI
appears flom their language, tihir mailnners, andl reiigiois rites;
circumfiances more decisive, with regard to the origin of nationa,
thar either fabulous traditions, or the talcs of ill-inforied and crc-
dulous Annalif-s. The Scots, if we may believe the common ac-
counts, iettled at firfl ill Ireland; alnd, extending themifelves by
degrees, landed at last on the coast: opposite to that island, and
fixed their habitations there. Fierce and bloody wars wcre, (uring
several ages, carried on between them and the Pids. At length,
Kenneth II. the iixty-ninth King of the Scots (according to their A.. 5). .
own fabulous authors) obtained a complete victory over the PiCts,
and united under one monarchy, all the country, from the wall of
Adriian, to the northern ocean. The kintgdom, enceforward, be-
came known by its preIlcit name, whiich it derived from a people
who at lirfl ifttlel there as firangers, and remained long obscure
and inconliierable.

j'lo.M this periotl tie hihLory of Scotland wSould merit some l[ifiorv of

attention, were it accompalnied with any certainty. But as our re-
mote antiqulities are involved ill the sinCe (arknefs with thole of

o 'sll:'''-

other nations, a calamity peculiar to ourtilves has thrown aimofl
an equal (blcurity over our more recent tranfictions. This was
occalioncd by the nmalicious po)licy of dwvardl I. of England. 'o -
wards the cld, ofthe thl irteenth century, this monarch called in

B 2 qucfion

B 0 I0 queltion the independence of Scotland; pretending that the king-
- dar ndom was held as a fief of the crown of .ngland, and fibjc'ced to

all the conditions of a feudal tenure. In order to elablifh his
claim, he seized the public archives, he ransacked churches and
molnafleries, and getting poecfilon, by force or fraud, of many
hiflorical monuments, which tended to prove the antiquity or free-
dolm of the kingdom, he carried some of them into England, and
commanded the reft to be burned Z. An universal oblivion of
past tranfadtions might have been the effed of this fatal event, but
rome imperfect Chronicles had escaped the rage of Edward;
foreign writers had recorded olme important fads relating to Scot-
land; and the traditions concerning recent occurrences wvere frefli
and worthy of credit. These broken fi-agments John de Fordun,
who lived in the fourteenth century, colleted with a pious industry,
and from them gleaned materinis vwilch he formed into a regular
history. His work was received by his countrymen with applause;
and, as no recourfc could be had to more ancient records, it sup-
plied the place of the authentic annals of the kingdom. It was
copied in many monasteries, and the thread of the narrative was
continued by different monks, through the subsequent reigns. In
the beginning of the sixteenth century, John Major and Hector
Boethius published their histories of Scotland, the former a fuccint
and dry writer, the latter a copious and florid one, and both equally
credulous. Not many years after, Buchanan undertook the fame
work; and if his accuracy and impartiality had been, in any de-
gree, equal to the elegance of his taste, and to the purity and vigour
of his style, his history might be placed on a level with the
most admired compositions of the ancients. But, instead of
rejecting the improbable tales of Chronicle writers, he was at the

and graces of filion, thlfe legends, which formerly had only its
wvldnef! and extravagance.

TH'E history of Scotland may properly be divided into four Fourl re-
ecriods. The iirft reaches from the origin of the monarchy, to .I,-;II ill

Scottilh

the reign of Kenneth II. IThe fccond fiom Kenneth's conqucif of hillory.
tlhe Picls, to the death of Alexander III. The third extends to the
death of James V. The lafl, from thence to the acccfion of
James-VI. to the crown of England.

TIHE first period is the region of pure fable and conjeature,

and ought to be totally neglcct ed, or abandoned to the industry
and credulity of antiquaries. Truth begins to dawn in the fccond
period, with a light, fccble at fritl, but gradually increasing; and
the events which then halppened may be llightly touched, but
merit no particular or laborious inquiry. In the third period, the
history of Scotland, chiefly by means of records preserved in Eng-
land, becomes more authentic: not only are events related, but
their caulfs and efflcts explained; the charadcrs of the actors
are displayed ; the manners of the age dcfcribed; the revolutions
in the conflitution pointed out: and here every Scotfinan should
begin not to read only, but to fludy the history of his country.
During the fourth period, tlhe afairs of Scotland were so mingled
with those of other nations, its ,ituation in the political state of
Europe was so important, its influence on the operations of the
neighbouring kingdoms was so visible, that its history becomes an
objeC of attention to foreigners; and without some knowledge of
the various and extraordinary revolutions which happened there,
they cannot form a just notion with refpear either to the moif

'ITHE period fromI the death of Alexander III. to the death of

James VT. contains upwards of twvo centuries and a half, from the
year one tilouiand two hundred and eighty-fix, to the year one

lte;'nii1' sdcncc of Scotland. 3Bfore the union of the two kingdoms, this
llle htl)CC1'- as al queFion of mucl importance. If the one crown had been
;cltla2Il. confidered not as imperial and independent, but as feudatory to

the other, a treaty of union could not have been concluded on
equal terms, and every advantage which the dependent kingdom
procured, mufl have been deemed the conceflion of a Sovereign to
his vaflal. Accordingly, about the beginning of the present
century, and while a treaty of union between the two kingdoms was
negociating, this controversy was agitatedl wlith all the heat which
national animofities naturally infiire. VWhat was then the ftubljca
of serious concern, the union of the two kingdoms had rendered
a niatter of mere curiosity. But though the objeets which at that

time

line warmed and interi cled both nations, cxiti no longer, a queflion 1' o 0 K

though theec petty principalities -ierc gradually formed into one

the Daines, and ofi'cn Lubjectldd to the yokle of thore formidable
pirates, feldoin turned their arms towards Scotland, and were little
able to eftablilh new rights in that country. The first Kings of the
Norman race, bufled with introducing their own laws and man-
ners into the kilngdom which they had conquered, or with main-
taining thcmfelvcs on the throne which some of them pofleffed
by a very dubious title, were as little iblicitous to acquire new
authority, or to form new pretensions in Scotland. An unexpe&-
ed calamity that besel one of the Scottish Kings first encouraged
the Englill to think of bringing llis kingdom under dependence.
William firnamed the Lion beling takeen prisoner at Alnwick,
-Henry II. as the price of his liberty, not only extorted from him
an exorbitant ransom, and a promise to surrender the places of
grcateft Ilrength in his dominions, but comp)elled him to do
homage for his whole kingdom. Richard I. a generous Prince,
solemnly renounced this claim of homage, and absolved William
fiom the hard conditions which Henry had imposed. Upon the
death of Alexander III. near a century after, Edward I. availing
himself of the situation of affairs in Scotland, acquired an influ-
ence in that kingdom which no Englifl Monarch before him ever
pofllned, and, imitating the interested policy of Henry, rather
than tle magnanimity of Richard, revived the claim of Ibvcrcignty
to which the former had pretended.

F.r * .;.o MR.MARGlARET of Norway, Grandaughter of Alexander, and heir
.n L ,lcc : to hi's crovwn, did not long lirvive him. The right of sic-

.n;;cj. ccitio belonged to the descendants of David Earl of Huntingdon,

third

,hird son of King David I. Among these, Robert Bruce, and John B 0 0 K
Baliol, two illustrious competitors for the crown, appeared. Bruce ,-- ~
was the son of Isabel, Earl David's second daughter; Baliol, the
grandson of Mv-rgaret the eldest daughter. According to the rules
of succession which are now established, the right of Baliol was
preferable, and, notwithstanding Bruce's plea of being nearer in
blood to Earl David, Baliol's claim, as the rcprcicntativc of his
mother and grandmother, would be deemed inconteflable. But in
that age, the order of fucceflion was not ascertained with the fame
precision. The question appeared to be no lcfs intricate, than it
wras important. Though the prejudices of the people, and perhaps
the laws of the kingdom, favoured Bruce, each of the rivals was
supported by a powerful fa&Eion. Arms alone, it was feared, mu:ll
terminate a dispute too weighty for the laws to decide. But, in
order to avoid the miseries of a civil war, Edward was chotfen
umpire, and both parties agreed to acquiesce in his decree. This
had well nigh proved fatal to the independence of Scotland; and
the nation, by its eagerness to guard against a civil war, was not
only exposed to that calamity, but almost iubjeded to a foreign
yoke. Edward was artful, brave, entcrprifing, and commanded a
powerful and martial people, at peace witl the whole world. The
anarchy which prevailed in Scotland, and the ambition of com-
petitors ready to sacrifice their country in order to obtain even a
dependent Crown, invited him first to feizc, and then to fubjecl
the kingdom. The authority of an umpire, which had been un-
warily bellowed upon him, and from which the Scots dreaded no
dangerous consequences, enabled him to execute his schemes with
the greater facility. Under pretence of examining the queflion
with the utmost solemnity, he summoned all the Scottifil Barons
to Norham, and having gained some, and intimidated others, he
prevailed on all who were present, not excepting Bruce and Baliol,

VOL. I. C the

B 010 li the competitors, to acknowledge Scotland to be a fief of the

'-- - ' Englifi Crown, and to swear fealty to hitn as their Sove;reign or

Lige Lord/. This ftep led to another fsill more important. As it
was vain to pronounce a sentence which lie had not power to
execute, Edward demanded pofleffion of the kingdom, that lie
might be able to deliver it to him whose right flould be found pre-
ferable ; and fitch was the pusillanimity of the nobles, and the
impatient ambition of the competitors, that both afientcd to this
firange demand, and Gilbert de Umfi-aville, Earl of Angus, was
the only man wlho refused to fiurrender the cafiles in his custody to
the enemy of his country. Edward finding Baliol the moPs obfc-
quious and the leafl formidable of the two competitors, soon after
gave judgment in his favour. Baliol once more profcefed himfell
the vaflal of England, and submitted to every condition which the
Sovereign whom lie had now acknowledged was pleased to prc-
fcribc.

EDWARD, having thus placed a creature of his own upon the

throne of Scotland, and compelled the nobles to renounce the
ancient liberties and independence of their country, had reason to
conclude that his dominion was now fully eftablified. But he
began too soon to aflume the master; his new vafials, fierce and in-
dependent, bore with impatience a yoke, to which they were not
accustomed. Provoked by his haughtiness, even the paflive
spirit of Baliol began to mutiny. But Edward, who had no longer
use for such a pageant king, forced him to resign the Crown, and
openly attempted to seize it as fallen to himself Ly the rebellion
of his vassal. At that critical period arose Sir William Wallace, a
hero, to whom the fond admiration of his countrymen hath as-
cribed many fabulous ads of prowess, though his real valour, as
well as integrity and wisdom, are such as need not the heightenings

of

of fi&ion. I-Ie, almost tingle, ventured to take arms in defence of '3 01°0 K
the kingdom, and his boldness revived the spirit of his country-
men. At last, Robert Bruce, the grandson of him who flood in
competition with Baliol, appeared to affcrt his own rights, and to
vindicate the honour of his country. The nobles, afliamcd of
their former bafcnefs, and enraged at the many indignities offlcred
to the nation, crowded to his standard. In order to crush him at
once, the Englilh Monarch entered Scotland, at the head of a
mighty army. Many battles were fought, and the Scots, though
often :anquified, were not subdued. The ardent zeal with which
the nobles contended for the independence of the kingdom, the
prudent valour of Bruce, and above all a national enthuliafin in-
-ipircd by such a caufc, bafflcd the repeated efforts of Edward, and
counterbalanced all the advantages which he derived from the
number and wealth of his fulbjcls. Though the war continued
with little intermiflion upwards of fevcnty years, Bruce and his
poftcrity kept pofeifflion of the throne of Scotland, and reigned
with an authority not inferior to that of its former Monarchs.

BUT while the sword, the ultimate judge of all difputcs between

contending nations, was employed to terminate this controversy,
neither Edward nor the Scots seemed to diflruft the justice of their
cause; and both appealed to history and records, and from there
produced, in their own favour, such evidence as they pretended to
be unanfwcrablc. The letters and memorials addressed by each
party to the Pope, who was then reverenced as the common
father, and often appealed to as the common judge of all Christian
Princes, are fill extant. The fabulous tales of the early British
history; the partial testimony of ignorant Chroniclers; filppofiti-
tious treaties and charters; are the proofs on which Edward found-
ed his title to the sovereignty of Scotland; and the homage done

Ill-founded, however, as their right was, the Englifl did not fail
to revive it, in all the subsequent quarrels between the two king-
doms; while the Scots difciairned it with the utmost indignation.
To this we mutt impute the fierce and implacable hatred to each
otler, which long inflamed both. Their national antipathies were
excited, not only by the usual circumstances of frequent holfilitics,
and reciprocal injuries; but the Englifi confidered the Scots as
vaflals who had presumed to rebel, and the Scots, in their turn,
regarded the Englill as usurpers who aimed at enslaving thci
country.

Lord; we are apt to pronounce him a powerful, nay an abfclute _.

ariftocratical. \Vith all the cnfigns of royalty, and with many
appearances of dcfpotic power, a fcudal king was the mofl limited

name of benqizcia orfiefs, was divided amongst his principal of-
ficers. As the common safety required tlat these officers should,

_ -_ defence, and should continue obedient to their General, they

bound themselves to take the field, when called, and to serve him
with a number of men, in proportion to the extent of their ter-
ritory. These great officers again parcelled out their lands among
their followers, and. annexed the fame condition to the grant. A
feudal kingdom was properly the encampment of a great army;
military ideas predominated, military subordination was efta-
bliflhed, and the possesSion of land was the pay which soldiers re-
ceived for their personal fcrvice. In consequence of these notions,
the pofieflion of land was granted during pleasure only, and Kings
were elective. In other words, an officer disagreeable to his Ge-
neral was deprived of his pay, and the person who was most
capable of conduciing an army was chosen to command it. Such
were the firfl rudiments, or infancy of feudal government.

BUT long before the beginning of the fourteenth century, the

feudal fyfltcmi had undergone many changes, of which the fol-
lowing were the most considerable. Kings, formerly eleaive, were
then hereditary; and fiefs, granted at first during pleasure, de-
icendcd from father to son, and were become perpetual. These
changes, not less advantageous to the nobles than to the prince,
made no alteration in the ariftocratical spirit of the feudal confti-

General tution. The king, who at a distance seemed to be invested with

vwhen embaflies to foreign courts were rare; when armies were -
composed of soldiers who fcrved witlout pay; it was not ncceflary
that a king flould pofieTs a great revenue; nor did the condition
of Europe, in those ages, allow its princes to be opulent. Com-
merce made little progress in the kingdoms where the feudal go-
vernment was eftablilhed. Institutions, which had no other obje&c
but to inspire a martial spirit, to train men to be soldiers, and to
make arms the only honourable profeflion, naturally dilfouraged
the commercial arts. The revenues, arising from the taxes im-
posed on the different branches of commerce, were by confrc-
quence inconsiderable; and the prince's trcafury received little
supply, from a source, which, among a trading people, flows with
such abundance, and is almost inexhaustible. A fixed tax was
not levied even on land; such a burthen woulld have appeared
intolerable to men who received their cfates as the reward of
their valour, and who confidered their service in the field as a full
retribution for what they possessed. The king's ilchfi(ics, or the
portion of land which he fill retained in his own hands unalien-
ated, furnifhled fubfiflence to his court, and defrayed the ordinary
expence of government g. The only stated taxes which the feudal
law obliged vassals to pay to the king, or to those of whom they
held their lands, were three; one when his eldefi ton was made
a knight ; another when his eldest daughter was married ; and a
third in order to ranfomn him if he fiould happen to be taken
prisoner. Besides these, the king received the feudal casualties of
the ward, marriage, &c. of his own vafials. And, on romne extra-
ordinary occasions, his subjects granted him an aid, which they
diftinguifed by the name of a be;icvolezce, in order to declare
that he received it not in consequence of any right, but as a gift,

feudal Inonarch to aim at diminishing the exorbitant power and
wealth of the nobility, but instead of enabling him to carry on
his fchlcmes with full cffect, kept him in continual indigence,
anxiety, and dependence.

They hnd NOR could the king supply the defea of his revenues, by the
no ltanding
armies. terror of his arms. Mercenary troops and flanding armies were

unknown, as long as the feudal government subsistcd in vigour.
Europe was peopled with soldiers. The vassals of the king, and
the fub-vafials of the barons, were all obliged to carry arms.
\Vhile the poverty of princes ipl .:red them from fortifying
their frontier towns, whliile a campaign continued but a few weeks,
and while a fierce and impetuous courage was impatient to bring
every quarrel to the decision of a battle, an army, without pay
and with little discipline, was fuflicient for all the purposes both of
the security and of the glory of the nation. Such an army, how-
ever, far from being an engine at the king's disposal, was often
no less formidable to him, than to his enemies. The more war-
like any people were, the more independent they became; and
the fame persons being both soldiers and fubjeds, civil privileges
and immunities were the consequence of their victories, and the
reward of their martial exploits. Conquerors, whom mercenary
armies, under our present forms of government, often render the
tyrants of their own people, as well as the scourges of mankind,
were commonly, under the feudal conflitution, the most indulgent
of all princes to their subjects, because they flood most in need
of their aftfiance. A prince, whom even war and vitories did
not render the master of his own army, possessed hardly any

soldiers mingled with his other fubjeas; not a tingle man received -_-.
pay from him; many ages elapsed even before a guard \wass ap-
pointed to defend his person; and destitute of that great inflru-
ment of dominion, a ifanding army, the authority of the king
continued always feeble, and was often contemptible.

NOR were these the only circumflances which contributed to- Their jurlf-

wards depressing the regal power. By the feudal fyftcm, as has di.tiou wia
been already observed, the king's judicial authority was extremely
circumscribed. At firfi, princes seem to have been the supreme
judges of their people, and, in person, heard and determined all
controversies among them. The multiplicity of causes soon made
it necessary to appoint judges, who, in the king's name, decided
matters that belonged to the royal jurifdiaion. But the Barba-
rians, who over-ran Europe, having detfroyed most of the great
cities, and the countries which they seized being cantoned out
among powerful chiefs, who were blindly followed by numerous
dependants, whom, in return, they were bound to protea from
every injury; the administration of juflice was greatly interrupted,
and the execution of any legal sentence became almofi impracicable.
Theft, rapine, murder, and disorder of' all kinds, prevailed in every
kingdom of Europe, to a degree almost incredible, and scarce com-
patible with the fubfifence of civil focicty. Every offender fhel-
tered himself under the protection of some powerful chieftain,
who screened him from the pursuits of juflice. To apprehend,
and to punish a criminal, often required the union and effort of
half a kingdom i. In order to remedy there evils, many persons

----- ' within their own territories. But what we may presume was, at

first, only a temporary grant, or a personal privilege, the incroach-
ing spirit of the nobles gradually converted into a right, and ren-
dered hereditary. The lands of some were, in process of time,
erected into Baronoies, those of others into Regalities. The jurif-
diaion of the former was extensive; that of the latter, as the
name implies, royal, and almost unbounded. All causes, whether
civil or criminal, were tried by judges, whom the lord of the
regality appointed; and if the king's courts called any person
within his territory before them, the lord of regality might put
a flop to their proceedings, and by the privilege of replrnizsgg, re-
move the cause to his own court, and even punish his vafatl, if
he fiiubmittd to a foreign jurisdiction ". Thus almost every question,
in which any person who resided on the lands of the nobles was
interefled, being determined by judges appointed by the nobles
thcimfelves, their vaifals were hardly sensible of being, in any
degree, fubje to the crown. A feudal kingdom was split into

many small principalities, almost independent, and held together B o0 K
by a feeble and commonly an imperceptible bond of union. The ,-
king was not only firipped of the authority annexed to the person
of a supreme judge, but his revenue suffered no finall diminution,
by the loss of those pecuniary emoluments, which were, in that
age, due to the person who administered juflicc.

IN the fame proportion that the king funk in power, the nobles

rose towards independence. Not satisfied with having obtained a
hereditary right to their fiefs, which they formerly held during
pleasure, their ambition aimed at fomcthing bolder, and by intro-
ducing entails, endeavoured, as far as human ingenuity and in-
vention can reach that end, to render their pofleffions unalienable
and everlasting. As they had full power to add to the inherit-
ance tranfinitted to them from their anccflors, but none to diminill
it; time alone, by means of marriages, legacies, and other acci-
dents, brought continual acceflions of wealth and of dignity; a
great family, like a river, became considerable from the length
of its course, and as it rolled on, new honours and new property
flowed fucceflively into it. Whatever influence is derived from
titles of honour, the feudal barons likewise pofieffed in an ample
manner. These marks of diftinlion are, in their own nature,
either official or personal, and being annexed to a particular
charge, or bestowed by the admiration of mankind upon illus-
trious characters, ought to be appropriated to these. But the son,
however unworthy, could not bear to be stripped of that appella-
tion by which his father had been diftinguifked. His prefump-
tion claimed, what his virtue did not merit; titles of honour be-
came hereditary, and added new lustre to nobles already in pol-
feflon of too much power. Something more audacious and more
extravagant fdill remained. The supreme direction of all affairs,

D 2 both

B 0 K ) both civil and military, being committed to the great officers of
3-t the crown, the fame and safety of princes, as well as of their

people, depended upon the fidelity and abilities of these officers.
lBut such was the preposterous ambition of the nobles, and so fuc-
cefsful even in their wildest attempts to aggrandize themselves,
that in all the kingdoms where the feudal institutions prevailed,
imoi of the chief offlces of slate were annexed to great families,
and held, like fiefs, by hereditary right. A person whose undu-
tifil behaviour rendered him odious to his prince, or whose inca-
pacity expoicd him to the contempt of the people, often held a
place of power and trust of the greatest importance to both. In
Scotland, the offices of Lord Jultice General, Great Chamber-
lain, High Steward, High Conflable, Earl Marshal, and I-igh
Admiral, were all hereditary; and in many counties, the office
of Sheriff was held in the fame manner.

NOBLES, whose property was so extensive, and whose power

was so great, could not fail of being turbulent and formidable.
Nor did they want instruments for executing their boldest designs.
That portion of their lands, which they parcelled out among
their followers, supplied them with a numerous band of faithful
and determined vassals; while that which they retained in their
own hands, enabled them to live with a princely splendor. The
great hall of an ambitious baron was often more crowded than
the court of his sovereign. The strong castles in which they
resided, afforded a secure retreat to the discontented and seditious.
A great part of their revenue was spent upon multitudes of indi-
gent, but bold retainers. And if at any time they left their re-
treat to appear in the court of their sovereign, they were accom-
panied, even in times of peace, with a vast train of armed fol-
lowers. The usual retinue of'William the sixth Earl of Douglas

consisted

consisted of two thousand horse. Those of the other nobles were B 0 0 i'
magnificent and formidable in proportion. Impatient of fubor- -,--
dination, and forgetting their proper rank, tich potent and
haughty barons were the rivals, rather than the fllljeds, of their
prince. They oftcn despised his orders, inifltcd his person, and
wrcftcd from him his crown. The history of Europe, during
several ages, contains little else but the accounts of the wars and
revolutions occasioned by their exorbitant ambition,

BUT, if the authority of the barons far exceedcd its proper 'IThirpower

balance which ought to be prcferved between a king and'his nobles thla il; any
was almost entireiy loft in Scotland. The Scottish nobles enjoyed, don-.
in common with those of other nations, all the means for cxtending
their authority which arise from the ariftocratical genius of the
feudal government. Belides thcfe, they poflenficd advantages pe-
culiar to themselves: the accidental lourccs of their power were
considerable; and singular circumstances concurred with the iiirit
of the conflitution to aggrandize them. To enumerate the mofl The parti-

and rivers, fct bounds to despotic power, and amidst there is the
natural feat of freedom and independence. In such places did the

it being almost inpracticable to lead an army, through a barren
country, to places of difficult access to a ingle man. The fame
causes which checked the progress of the Roman arms, and ren-
dered all the efforts of Edward I. abortive, often protected the
Scottish nobles from the vengeance of their prince; and they owed
their perbsnal independence to those very mountains and marshes
which saved their country from being conquered.

Tie 'imall II. TIIE want of great cities in Scotland contributed not a little
number of
great cities. to increase the power of the nobility, and to weaken that of the

prince. Wherever numbers of men assemble together, order muff
be established, and a regular form of government instituted; the
authority of the magistrate muff be recognized, and his decifio-ls
meet with prompt and full obedience. Laws and subordination
take rife in cities; and where there are few cities as in Poland,
or none as in Tartary, there are few or no traces of a well-arranged
police. But under the feudal governments, commerce, the chief
means of aflembling mankind, was negleced; the nobles, in order
to ftrengthcn their influence over their vafials, resided among
them, and seldom appeared at court, where they found a superior,
or dwelt in cities, where they met with equals. In Scotland, the
fertile counties in the South lying open to the Englilh, no town
situated there could rife to be great or populous amidst continual
inroads and alarms: the residence of our monarchs was not fixed
to any particular place; many parts of the country were barren
and uncultivated; and in consequence of there peculiar circum-
frances, added to the general causes flowing from the nature of
.the feudal inflitutions, the towns in Scotland were extremely few,
and very inconsiderable. The vassals of every baron occupied a
.diftinC portion of the kingdom, and formed a separate and almost

protection, they were all in arms for his defence, and obftruQed
the operations of juitice to the utmost. The prince was obliged to
connive at criminals whom lie could not reach ; the nobles, con-
fcious of this advantage, were not afraid to offend; and the difli-
culty of punifhingt almost assured them of impunity.

in rendering the nobles considerable. The nations which over- clans.
ran Europe were originally divided into many small tribes ; and
when they came to parcel out the lands which they had conquered,
it was natural for every chieftain to bestow a portion, in the firti
place, upon those of his own tribe or family. Theie all held
their lands of him ; and as the safety of each individual ldelpctlccd
on the general union, thcie finall societies clung together, and
were distinguished by tome common appellation, either patrony-
mical or local, long before the introduLd'ion of i;Lr-namcs, or c'-
figs armorial. But when there became common, the dcicclndaiits
and relations of every chieftain assumed the fame name and arms
with him; other vafiils were proud to imitate their example,
and by degrees they were communicated to all those who held of
the fame superior. Thus clanhiips were formed; and in a ge-
neration or two, that consanguinity, which was at first in a great
measure imaginary, was believed to be real. An artificial union
was converted into a natural one; men willingly followed a leader
whom they regarded both as the funerior of their lands and the
chief of their blood, and served him not only with the fidelity of
vaflals, but with the afiecion of fiiends. In the other feudal king-l
doms we may observe such unions as we have described imperfctly
formed; but in Scotland, whether they were the produltion of

genealogies both genuine and fabulous, clanfhips were universal.
Such a confederacy might be overcome, it could not be broken; and
no change of manners, or of government, has been able, in some
parts of the kingdom, to dissolve associations which are founded
upon prejudices so natural to the human mind. How formidable
were nobles at the head of followers, who, counting that cause
jufi and honourable which their chief approved, rushed into the
field at his command, ever ready to sacrifice their lives in defence
of his person or of his fame ? Against such men a king con-
tended with great disadvantage; and that cold service which
money purchaics, or authority extorts, was not an equal match
for their ardour and zeal.

hc fInail lrIV. THE smallness of their number may be mentioned among
number of
tle nobles. the caufcs of the grandeur of the Scottish nobles. Our annals

reach not back to the first division of property in the kingdom;
but so far as we can trace the matter, the original poffeflions of
the nobles seem to have been extcnfive. The ancient Thanes
were the equals and the rivals of their prince. Many of the
earls and barons who succeedcd them, were matters of territories
no lces ample. France and England, countries wide and fertile,
afforded fettlcmcnts to a numerous and powerful nobility. Scot-
land, a kingdom neither extensive nor rich, could not contain many
tich overgrown proprietors. But the power of an aristocracy always
diminiflhes in proportion to the increase of its-numbers; feeble
if divided among a multitude, irresistible if centered in a few.
When nobles are numerous, their operations nearly refemblethofe
of the people; they are routed only by what they feel, not by
what they apprehend; and submit to many arbitrary and opreflive

than any tic whatever, they gave much umbrage to our kings,
and contributed not a little to the power and independence of the

Douglas entered into a league of this kind with the earls of Craw-

has placed no barrier between the two kingdoms; a river, almost
every where fordable, divides them towards the cafl: on the weft
they are separated by an imaginary line. The slender revenues
of our kings prevented them from fortifying, or placing garrisons
in the towns on the frontier ; nor would the jealousy of their sub-
jces have permitted such a method of defnlce. The barons,
whole eflates lay near the borders, confidered themfclves as bound
both in honour and in interest to repel the enemy. The 'varden-
f.Jips of the different omarckes, offices of great power and dignity,
were generally bcflowcd on them. This gained them the leading
of the warlike counties in the south ; and their vatfals, living in
a Rate of perpetual hofility, or enjoying at bell an insecure peace,
became more inured to war than even the rect of their country-

men, and more willing to accompany their cl-ieftain in his moSt I ,°
hardy and dangerous entcrprifes. It was the valour no le-s than ---.-J
the number of their followers, that rendered the Doullafes great.
The nobles in the northern and midland counties were ofteln duti-
ful and ob(lquious to the crown, but our monarchi s as found
it inmpracicable to lfbduc the mutinous and undgovernable liriti of
the borderers. In all our domeflic quarrels, tliole vho could draw
to their lide the inhabitants of the ibutlrn counrties, wesre al-
lmof filr- of victory ; and conscious of this advantage, the lords
wh1o poflhcfiedl authority thcre, were apt to forget the dut)y which
lhyc owed their forercign, and to aliire beyond the rank of
fubjicets.

VII. Tni- calamities whilch besel our kings contributed more I'he requent

miiorities

than any other caule to climiiiflh the royal authority. Never was which hap-
any race of monarchs so unfortunate as the Scottifl. Of fix fuc- pencd in
ceflive princes, from Robert III. to James VI. not one died a na-
tural death; and the mlinorities, during that time, were longer,
and more frequent, than ever happened in any other kingdom.
From Robcrt Bruce to James VI. we reckon ten princes; and
ficven of there were called to the throne while they were minors,
and alinofl infants. Even the moil: regular and bcfl: cflablied
governments feel enTfibly the pernicious efrlcts of a minority, and
either become languid and inactive, or are thrown into violent
and unnatural convulsions. But, under the ilnperfecL- and ill-
adjutled tfflem of government in Scotland, there eflecQs were fill
more fatal; the fierce and mutinous spirit of the nobles, unrc-
firained by the authority of a king, feorned all fubjecdion to the
delegated jurifdiCion of a regent, or to the feeble commands of
a minor. The royal authority was circumferibed within narrower
limits than ever; the prerogatives of the crown, naturally incon--

E 2 fideral)le,

B 0 0 K fdlerablc, were reduced almost to nothing; and the ariftocratical

i.. .---,--; lpower gradually rose upon the ruins of tlh monarchical. I.eft

the personal power of a regent Ihould enable him to acl with too
much vigour, the authority anncxed to that office was sometimes
rendered inconsiderable, by being diviled ; or, if a iingle regent
was cholcn, the greatcr nobles, and the heads of the more illus-
trious families, were seldom raiscd to that dignity. It wvas often
conerr-cd upon men who poffeflcd little influence and excited no
jcaloulfy. They, conscious of thcir own weaknces, were obliged
to overlook iome irregularities, and to permit others; and
in order to support their authority, which was destitute of real
Ilrength, tllcy endcavoured to gain the nmoft powerful and acqive
barons, by granting them lpofneflions and nlimnunitics, which raised
theml to still greater power. \;lhen the king himielf came to
afTume the reins of government,, he found his revenues walled or
alienated, the crown lands seized or given away, and the nobles
so accustomed to independence, that, after the struggles of a whole
reign, he was seldom able to reduce them to the fame state in
which they had been at the beginning of his minority, or to wrest

ileview of froin them what they had uilrped during that time. If we take
the events fia-
vouran'le to a view of what happened to each of our kings, who was so un-
the nobles fortunate as to be placed in this situation, the truth and importance
during cachi
minority. of this obfcrvation will fully appear.

turbcd lby the pretensions of Idward Baliol, who, relying on the
aid of Ingl:nd, and on time fipplort of fomnec diflTfilcld barons
among the Scots, invaded the kingdom. The fuccels which at
first attended his arms, obliged the young king to retire to France;
and Baliol took possession of the throne. A finall body of the
nobles, however, continuing faithful to their exiled prince, drove

13aliol

Baliol out of Scctland; and after an albfcice of nine years, 5axvid B C ' '
returned froin l:'iance, and tookt tie governmcent of the kingdom i .
into llis own1 hands. Itut nobles, who wvre thus watning their
blood and treCafn.: ill dcence of tlhe crowl, had a rilght to the un-
diturlcdtl lpofeio of the1ir ancient privileges ; and even lrlnc title
to arrogate ncw ones. It Icemis to have been a 1maxim inl tlat

his uncle Robert duke of itAlbany, and then by lMurdo the fln
of Robert. Ioth these noblemen afliredl to the crown ; and theiir
unnatural ambition, if we may believe moll of our hiilorianls, not
only cut flort the days of prince David, the king's elder brother,
but prolonged the captivity of James. They flattered thcifelves
that tlicy might ftep with le's oppolition into a throne, when
almofl vacant: and, dreading the king's return as thie extindion
of their authority and the end of their hopes, they carried on
the negociations for obtaining his liberty with cxtrcrec rcmiillTes.
At the fame time, they neglctled nothing that could either sooth
or bribe the nobles to approve of their fchImce. They slackened
the reins of government; they allowed the prerogative to be en-
croached upon; they fuficrcd the most irregular acds of power,

and

.B O K and even wanton ins-ances of oppression, to pass with impunity;

5._ they dealt out the patrimony of the crown anong thofc whose

.enmity they dreaded or hose favtour tihey hlad gained ; and re-
duced the royal authority to a Rlate of imbecility, from which
succeeding monarchs laboured in vain to raile it.

as well as the cuftoly of tlhe king's person were committed to Sir

-;tjlaes l. EIIIGT persons were chosen to govern the kingdom during the

minority of James III. Lord Boyd, however, by fcizing the per-
ion of the young king, and by the afccndant which lie acquired
over him, ioon cngrofled the whole authority. I-Ie formed the am-
bitious projctl of rairing his family to the fame pitch of power
and grandeur with tholf of the prime nobility; and he efleted it.
While intent on this, lie relaxed the vigour of gox-ernment, and
tlhe barons bccame accufomncd, once more, to anarchy and indc-
pendcnce. The power, which Boyd had been at lb much pains
to acquire, was of no long continuance, and the fall of his family,
according to thc fate of favourites, was fildden and deilrudive ;

but upon its ruins the family of Hamilton rose, which soon B 0°o F
attained the hlighefl rank in the kingdom.

As the minority of James V. was longer, it was likewise more James V,

tubulent, than thlofe of the prccding kings. And the contend-
i:n nobles, encouraged or protcrecd either by tlle king of France,
or of l. ugland, formed theimlelves into more regular factions, and
diliecgarldcd nmore than ever the relt-aints of order and authority.
Tle French had the advantage of secing one, devoted to their

native of France, and a grandson of James II. But Alexander

voked by thee repeated inflanccs of contempt, the regent aban-
doned his troublesome flation, and, retiring to France, 1referred
the tranquillity of a private life, to an olfice dcsitute of real

To tlicrc, and to many other causes, omitted or unolblrerved by

Their impatience to obtain this, precipitated H-enry III. of Eng-
land, Edward II. and tome other weak princes, into rafil and pre-
mature attempts againit the privileges of the barons, in which
they werc difippointed or perilied. Princes, of greater abilities,
were content to mitigate evils which they could not cure; they
fought occupation for the turbulent spirit of their nobles, in fre-
qluent .wars; and allowed their fiery courage to evaporate in so-
reign expeditions, which, if they brought no other aclvantage,
lecurcd at ceaft domeIric tranquillity. But time and accidents

' Ihcattre-pts ripened the feudal governments for dellruclion. Towards the end
;'n lumlb!c the
,iItc lnCes of the fifteenth century, and beginning of the sixteenth, all the
1r:,ice allnd princes of Europe attacked, as if by concert, the power of their

in I nd. nobles. Men of genius then undertook, with success, what tleir

unikilful predeceflors had attempted in vain. Lewis XI. of France,

till foine dillant period. Nor did tllcy produce confcquenccs lcts
oppolite. Lewis boldly added to the crown whatever lie wrestcd
firom the nobles. Henry undermined his Barons, by encouraging
them to'fell their lands, which enriched the commons, and gave
them a weight in tlhe legillature untnown t their predcccflors.
But while tlicfe great revolutions wer carrying on in two kingdoms But the no-

happened there ; our kingll could neither extend their own prero- Scotl'ad.
gative, nor enable the commons to cncroach upon the ariflocracy;
the nobles not only retained rmofl of their ancient privileges and
poneflfions, but continued to make new acquisitions.

Ti s was not owing to the inattention of our princes, or to Our kings
their want of ambition. They were abundanltly fenlble of tlhe nlvu

to extend lihe

exorbitant power of the nobility, and extremely solicitous to hu mble roy'l atlio-
that order. They did not, however, peoflcfs means ftificient for
accomplifling this end. The resources of our monarlcls were
xxrw, and tlhe progrcfs which they made was of course inconfidcr-
able. 3iut as the number of their follower-s, and the extent of General

menans to-

ftldom agree in acknowledging the authority of any common
filperior or judge, and their impatient spirit would seldom -vait
the ilow decisions of jufticc, their quarrels were usually terminated
by the sword. The offended baron afFcmbled his vafrals, and vwated
the lands, or sied the blood of his enemy. To forgive an injury,
was mean; to forbear revenge, infamous or cowardly '". Hence
quarrels were transmitted from father to son, and, under the name
of deadcly fl/iz , Ibfiflc(d lor many generations with unmitigated
rancour. It was the intcrefi of the crown to foment rather than
to extinguish tliefe quarrels; and by scattering or cherishing the
feeds of discord among the nobles, that union, which would have
rendered the aristocracy invincible, and which must at once have
annihilated the prerogative, was effectually prevented. To the
famc caufc, our kings; were indebted for the success with vhicl
they fometimcs attacked the most powerful chieftains. They em-

: The spirit of revenge was encouraged, not only by the manners, but, what

is more remarkable, by the laws of those ages. If any person thought the prose-
cution of an injury offered to his family too troublefomc, or too dangerous, the Sa-
lique laws permitted hini publicly to desist from demanding vengeance; but the
fame laws, in order to puniflh his cowardice, and want of affecSion to his family,
deprived him of the right of succession. Henault's Abrege Chronol. p. 8I. Among
the Anglo-Saxons, we find a singular inflitution distinguished by the name of fa-
litium ; a voluntary allbciation, the objec whereof was the personal security of
those who joined in it, and which the feebleness of government at that time rendered
neccflary. Among other regulations, which are contained in one of these still ex-
tant, the following defervcs notice: ' If any afiociate fihall either eat or drink with
a person who has killed any member of the folaltitum, unless in the presence of the
king, the bishop, or the count, and unless he can prove that he (lid not know the
person, let him pay a great fine." HIicks Dilfert. Epifiolar. apud Thefaur. Ling.

arming againfl the pcrfbn who had incurrcd their dilfpleafure thole

fiharing among them the spoils of the vanqriilhedl. But this expe-
dient, though it served to humble individuals, did not weaken the
body of the nobility. Thofi whio were now the inflruments of
their prince's vengeance became, in a ihort time, the olbjcas of
his fear. I-aving acquired power and wcealth l)y serving the
crown, they, in their turn, set up for independence: and thl ugh
there might be a ftuituation of power and of property; though
old families fell, and new ones role upon their ruins; the rights
of the ariflocracy remained entire, and its vigour unbroken.

II. As the administration of justice is one of the most powerful Extcnd the

juiltieti on

ties between a king and his fubljcts, all our molnarchs were at the of the king's
utmost pains to circumtcribe thec juriifidion of tle barons, and courts.
to extend that of the crown. The external sorns of fubordi-
nation, natural to the feudal yfcircm, favoured this attempt. An
appeal lay fi-om the judges and courts of the barons, to tlhot of
the king. Tle right, however, of judging in tlle liilf inlance
belonged to the nobles, and they cafily found means to defeat the
eflQca of appeals, as well as of many other feudal regulations. T'he
royal jurisdiction was almofl confined within the narrow litnits of
the king's demesnes, beyond which his judges claimed indeed mIuch
authority, but pooll:lcld next to none. Our kings were (cnllibllc eo
thelic limitations, and blore them with impatience. But it was
imnpofliblc to overturn in a moment, what 'was I deeply rooted;
ori' to i:'Vip tle nobles, at oilce, of privileges which tlhey had hldld

fe:udall contll'ttion. Tlo accon-lliil tiis, however, was an obl)jet
(f unilborlm ad anxious attelntion to all our prinues. James I. led

t--. __, and perfect police. HIe made choice, among the estates of par-

liament, of a certain number of persons, vwhom he difiinguifled
1)y the name of Lords of Scjion, and appointed them to hold
courts for determinining civil causes three times in the year, and
forty days at a time, in whatever place he pleased to name. Their
jurisdiCtion extended to all matters which iormerly came under the
cognizance of the king's council, and being a committee of par-
liament, their decisions were final. James II. obtained a law,.
annexing all regalities, which should be forfeited, to the crown,
and declaring the right of jurifdition to be unalienable for the
future. James III. imposed severe penalties upon those judges
appointed by the barons, whlofe decisions flhould be found on a
review to be unjust ; and, by many other regulations, endeavoured
to extend the authority of his own court . James IV., on pre-
tence of remedying the inconveniencies arising from the filort
terms of the court of Scflion, appointed other judges called Lords'
of Dajil Cozoiuil. The Sjfionz was an ambulatory court, and met
seldom: the Daildj C'ouncil was fixed, and fat constantly at Edin-
burgh; and though not composed of members of parliament, the
fame powers which the Lords of Seflion enjoyed were veiled in it.
At last James V. erected a new court that still fubtifts, and which
he named the Co/lr'e of 7iJlZice, the judges or Senators of which
were called Lords of Coouncil and ,S/iol. This court not only
exercised the fame jurifdilion which formerly belonged to the
Session and Daily Council, but new rights were added. Privileges
of great im!-ortance were granted to its members, its forms were
prefeiibed, its terms ficdl, and regularity, power, and fiplendour
conferred upon it°. The persons constituted judges in all these

confitl'on was unavoidable ; and many ponleftled their lands by
titlcs extremely dcefielivc. IDuring one of tliole truccs betwccn
the two nations, occasioned rather by their being weary of war

occafioed a dangerous conipiracy against his life.

James I. TIIE civil tranf1ci'ons in Scotland are better knownl since the

beginning of the reign of Jamcs I. and a complete series of our
laws iupplies the clefcSts of our historians. The Englilf made
some amends for their illiuflice in detaining that prince a prisoner,
by their generous care of his education. During his long refidencc
in E ngland le had an opportunity of observing the feudal fyficm
in a more advanced flatc, and refined fromn many of the imper-
feicions which /lill adhered to it in his own kingdom. I-Ie wrv

of men were accufiomcd to obecy them. Full of thele ideas, he re-
turned into his native country, which presented to him a very differ-
ent icene. The royal authorlity, never great, was now contemptible,
by having been ;) long- dlcgated to regents. The ancient patri-
mony and revenues of the crown were almnc:l totally alienated.

Ilis operations with much lprudence. I-Ie was in friendfhiip with
England, and clotely allied vith the French king: he was adored
by the people, wlo c enjoyed unusual security and happiness under
llis adminiitlration: and all his acquisitions, however fatal to the
body of the nobles, had been gained by attacks upon individuals ;
were obtained by lcciiIons of law ; and being founded on circum-
flances peculiar to the jerlblos Wvlho u-liced, might excie murmurs

jailes lI. CRcCIITON, the most able man of those who had the clireclion

of afrairs during the minority of James II. had been the minifler
of James 1. and well acquainted witl his resolution of humbling
the nobility. HIe did not relinquifl the design, and he endea-
voured to inlpire his pupil with the fame sentiments. But what
James had attempted to eflel: slowly, and by legal means, his son
and Criclton pursued with the inpetuofity natural to Scotrmen,
and with the 1iercenefs peculiar to that age. William the sixth
earl of Douglas was the firl- victim to their barbarous policy.
That young nobleman (as we have already oblerved), contemnin-
the authority of an infant prince, almnof openly renounced his
allegiance, and afplired to independence. Criclton, too high
spirited to bear ucll an insult, but too weak to curb or to bring
to justice so powerful an offender, decoyed him by many promises
to an interview in the castle of Edinburgh, and, notwithstanding
thcfe, murdered both him and his brother. Crichton, however,
gained little by this a&c of treachery, which rendered him uni-
verfally odious. WJilliam the eighth earl of Douglas was no
less powerful, and no lels formidable to tlhe crown. By form-
ing the league which wve already mentioned with the earl of'
Crawford and other baronrs, lie had united against his fovcrreign.
alhnof one half of hiis kingdom. 13ut his credulity led him
into the fame snare -which had been fatal to the former carl.

-;xplcdcl the signal to e. ;age, thle carl ordered thlcil to retire to
thcir camp ; and Sir lames Hamilton of Cadl.ow, the person in
whom lie placed the greatest confidence, convinced of his want of
genius to improve an opprtunity, or of his want of courage to
iL ize a crowni, deserted hlim that very night. lThis CxmpllC was
follwed vby ma ll ,; andl the earl, ciclfeicd or f-1r',ikcn by all, -as

BY one of these, not only all the vafi pofFefTions of the earl of

Douglas were annexed to the crown, but all prior and future

granted in time to come, without the consent of parliament ;
a condition which implied almosl an express prohibition. Those
nobles who already poflefled that ,reat privilege, would naturally be
solicitous to prevent it firom becoming common, by being bellowed
on many. Those who had not themselves attained it, would cnvy
others the acquisition of Iucli a flattering ldillindion, and both would

and to filrrcndler fomc of tlie firongell caRlcs and moil valuable

chlafed at the price of his own honour and the ilndependence of lhis
country, was punillually granted him, and the dukc'of Gloucester
twEith a powerful army conduled him towards Scolland. The
danger of . foreign invalion olliged Jalecs to implore the afsllt-
ancc of thole nobles whom lie had to long treated with con-
tempt. Some of them were in clofc confederacy with the duke of
Albany, alnd approved of all his pretcnllons. Others Cwre im-

pre-cminncei. They fcmced, however, to enter with zeal into

army of their followers, but with a itronger difpolition to rcdtrcs
their own grievanccs than to annoy the enemy; and with a fixed
relolution of punlilling thnfle minions wllofe insolence they could

B 0 o K discovers the capriciousness of James's charater, and accounts for
t_- __ the indignation of the nobles, when they beheld the favour due to

them, beitowed on such unworthy objeas.

JAMES had no reason to confide in an army so little under his

command, and, dismissing it, shut himself up in the cafile of Edin-
burgh. After various intrigues, Albany's lands and honours were
at length restored to him, and he seemed even to have regained
his brother's favour by some important services. But their friend-
Thip was not of long duration. James abandoned himself once
more to the guidance of favourites; and the fate of those who
had suffered at Lauder did not deter others from courting that
dangerous pre-eminence. Albany, on pretext that an attempt
had been made to take away his life by poison, fled from court,
and, retiring to his castle at Dunbar, drew thither a greater number
of barons than attended on the king himself. At the fame time
lhe renewed his former confederacy with Edward; the earl of
Angus openly negociated that infamous treaty; other barons were
ready to concur with it; and if the sudden death of Edward had
not prevented Albany's receiving any aid from England, the crown.
of Scotland would probably have been the reward of this unworthy
combination with the enemies of his country. But, instead of
any hopes of reigning in Scotland, he found, upon the death of
Edward, that he could not reside there in safety; and, flying first
to England and then to France, he seems from that time to have
taken no part in the affairs of his native country. Emboldened
by his retreat, the king and his ministers multiplied the insults
which they offered to the nobility. A standing guard, a thing
unknown under the feudal governments, and inconsistent with the
familiarity and confidence with which monarchs then lived amidif
their nobles, was raised for the king's defence, and the command

7 of

of it given to Rainfay, lately created earl of Bothwell, the fame 'B 0o O
person who had so narrowly escaped when his companions were -
put to death at Lauder. As if this precaution had not been sus-
ficicnt, a proclamation was ifIued, forbidding any person to appear
in arms within the precincts of the court '; which, at a time
lwhenc no man of rank left his own houfc without a numerous
retinue of armed followers, was, in efFet, dcbarring the nobles
from all acccfs to the king. James at the fame time became
fonder of retirement than ever, and, fink in indolence or super-
ftition, or attentive only to amufcments, devolved his whole
authority upon his favourites. So many injuries provoked the
most contiderable nobles to take arms, and having pcrfuadcd or
obliged the duke of Rothesay, the king's eldest son, a youth of
fifteen, to set himself at their head, they openly declared their
intention of depriving James of a crown of which he had dif-
covered himself to be so unworthy. Roused by this danger, the
king quitted his retirement, took the field, and encountered them
near Bannockburn; but the valour of the Borderers, of whom
the army of the malccontents was chiefly composed, soon put his
troops to flight, and he himself was slain in the pursuit. Sufpi-
cion, indolence, immoderate attachment to favourites, and all the
vices of a feeble mind, are visible in his whole conduct ; but the
character of a cruel and unrelenting tyrant seems to be unjustly
affixed to him by our historians. His negle& of the nobles irri-
tated, but did not weaken them ; and their discontent, the immo-
derate ambition of his two brothers, and their unnatural confe-
deracies witl England, were sufficient to have disturbed a more
vigorous administration, and to have rendered a prince of superior
talents unhappy.

B1 o0 K TI-IH indignation which many persons of rank expresscd againfr
--v,-... the conduct of the conspirators, together with the terror of the

fentcncc of excommunication wnhich the pope pronounced againfi
them, obliged them to use their vidcory with great moderationl
and Ihumanity). Being conscious how detclcable the crime of im-
bruing, their hands in the blood of their foyercign appeared, they-
endeavourcd to regain the good opinion of their countrymen, and
to atone for the treatment of the fathcr, by their loyalty and duty
towards the son. They placed him inflantly on the throne, and
the rwhole kingdom soon united in acknowledging his authority.
James IV. JAMES IV. was naturally generous and brave; he felt, in an

high degree, all the pallons which animate a young and noble
mind. He loved magnificence, he delighted in war, and was
eager to obtain fame. During his reign the ancient and here-
ditary nmiity between the king and noble es ems almost entirely
to have ceafcl. I-Ie envied not their fplcndor, because it contri-
buted to the ornlal.it of his court ; nor did 11c dread their power1,
;v'hich he confidered as the security of his kingdom, not as an
object of terror to himficlc. This confidence on his part met with
the proper return of duty and ai-cCion on theirs; and, in his
war with England, lie experienced how much a king beloved by
his nobles is able to perform. Though the ardour of his courage
and the spirit of chivalry, rather than the profpcct of any national
advantage, were the motives of that expedition, such was the zeal
of his fubjels for the king's glory, that lie was followed by as
gallant an army as ever any of his anccf'ors had led upon Englifi
ground. But though James himself formed no scheme dangerous
or detrimental to the aristocracy, his reign was diflinguilled by an
event extremely fatal to it; and one accidental blow humbled it
more than all the premeditated attacks of preceding kings. In

the

ence, and of tlie impotence of his own authority. After fcveral

Ilould ailLime the government, and that eight persons should be
appointed to attend him by turns, and to advise and affli him in

I-v ' divided power. He gained some of his colleagues, removed

others, and intimidated the reft. When the term of his attend-
ance expired, he fill retained authority, to which all were obliged
to submit, because none of them was in a condition to dispute it.
The affedtion of the young king was the only thing wanting, to
fix and perpetuate his power. But an adive and high-fpirited
prince submitted, with great impatience, to the restraint in which
he was kept. It ill suited his years, or disposition, to be confined
as a prisoner within his own palace; to be treated with no refpeC,
and to be deprived of all power. lie could not, on some occa-
sions, conceal his resentment and indignation. Angus foresaw
that he had much to dread from these ; and as he could not gain
the king's heart, he resolved to make sure of his person. James
was continually surrounded by the earl's spies and confidents;
many eyes watched all his motions, and observed every ftep he
took. But the king's eagerness to obtain liberty eluded all their
vigilance. I-Ic escaped from Falkland and fled to the castle of Stir-
ling, the reiidence of the queen his mother, and the only place of
strength in the kingdom which was not in the hand of the
Douglases. The nobles, of whom some were influenced by their
hatred to Angus, and others by their refped for the king, crowded
to Stirling, and his court was soon filled with persons of the greatest
diftinetion. The earl, though astonished at this unexpected
revolution, resolved, at first, to make one bold puih for recover-
ing his authority, by marching to Stirling at the head of his fol-
lowers; but he wanted either courage or strength to execute this
resolution. In a parliament held soon after, he and his adherents
were attainted, and after escaping from many dangers, and en-
during much misery, he was at length obliged to fly into Eng-
land for refuge.

JAMES

JAMES had now not only the name, but, though extremely B oo I0

young, the full authority of a king. I-e was inferior to no prince <--
of that age in gracefulness of person or in vigour of mind. I-Iis
undcrflanding was good, and his heart warm ; the formcr capable
of great improvement, and the latter iufceptible of the best im-
pressions. But, according to the usual fate of princes who are
called to the throne in their infancy, his education liad been ne-
glcQed. Flis private preceptors were more ready to flatter than
to instruct hlim. It was the intcreft of those who governed the
kingdom, to prevent him fiomn knowving too much. The earl of
Angus, in order to divert him from bulmclfs, gave him an early
taste for iluch plcafiires as afterwards occupied and engroflsed him
more than became a king. Accordingly we difcovcr in James all
the features of a great hut uncultivated spirit. On the one hand,
violent pailions, implacable resentment, an immoderate desire of
power, and the utmofl rage at dilappointmcnt. On the other,
love to his people, zeal for the puniflinent of private oppressors,
confidence in his favourites, and the most engaging openness and
affability of behaviour.

WIIHA he himfclf had suffered from the exorbitant power of

the nobles, led him early to imitate his predeccffors in their
attempts to humble them. The plan he formed for that purpose
was more profound, more systematic, and pursued with greater
conflancy and steadiness, than that of any of his ancefiors: And
the influence of the evcnts in his reign upon those of the fublE-
quent period render it necefary to explain his conduct at greater
length, and to enter into a more minute detail of his aCtions. He
had penetration enough to dilcover those defects in the schemes
adopted by former kings, which occalioned their miscarriage. The
example of James I. had taught him,. that wile laws operate slowly

on.

D o0 o K on a rude people, and that the fierce spirit of the feudal nobles
,--y--- , was not to be subdued by these alone. The effects of the violent

meafilres of James II. convinced hlin, that the oppression of one
great family is apt either to excite the suspicion and resentment of
the other nobles, or to enrich with its fipoils some new frimily,
which would foort adopt the me entirnents, and become equally
formidable to the crown. He fhw, froln the fatal end of James III.
that neglet was itill more intolerable to the nobles than opprclion,
and that the miniltry of new men and favourites was both dii-
honourable and dangerous to a prince. At the fame time he felt
that the authority of the crown was not fuficient to counterbalance
the power of the ariflocracy, and that without Ibmne new accecfion
of strength he could expcc no better success in the struggle than
his anceflors. In this extremity he applied himIelf to the clergy,
hoping that they would both rclilllhis plan, and concur, with all
their influence, in enabling him to putt it in execution. Under
the feudal govc-rnmcnt the church, being reckoned a third efrate,
had its reprcfentativcs in parliament; the number of these was
considerable, and thely poflclfcd great influence in that assembly.
The fuperflition of former Ikings, and tlce zeal of many ages of
ignorance, had ecfowed

l on ccclcliafics a great proportion of the

national wealth; and the authority which they acquired by the
reverence of the people, was fulperior even to that which they
derived from their ricles. This powerful body, however, de-
pended entirely on the crown. The popes, notwithstanding their
attention to extend their uflrpations, had neglected Scotland as a
dillant and poor kingdom, and permitted its kings to exercise
powers which they difltutcd with more considerable princes. The
Scottifi monarchs had the sole right of nomination to vacant
bilhoprics and abbeys '; and James na.urally concluded, that men

merit it, by promotingh his designs. Happily for him, the nobles -_
liad not yet recovered the blow which fell oil their order at Flow-
den ; and if we may judge cither from their conldul, or from
the cha raletr given of tihcm ly Sil Ralph Sadlcr, thle iinilifi envoy
in Scotland, tlhe were men of little genius, of no experience in
bu!inels, and incapable of ading cither with unanimity, or with
vigour. l/Ianv of tli clergy, onl the odiCr liind, were: ditinguiflch

him, but avenge tlicmlclvcs, and hoped to aggrandiie their own
order, lb deprcfnlg thole whro were their sole rivals. Secure of
s0i poerful a concurrence, James ventured to proceeld with greater
bloldncts. In the li-rt heat of resentment, lie liad driven the eari
of Angus out of the kingdom ; and, lenfible that a pcerfon io far
superior to the other nobles in abilities, might create man)- ob-
flacles whvich would retard or render ineflTcual all his felccies,
lie Iolenly Iwore, tlat lie would never permit himn to return into

Stirling, and otlier cafldes, and to fill his magazines with arlms and

'Thole ofhiccs, whlich they were apt, from long pofl'flion, to con-

alic s, who alone poflefld the king's car, and, together with a

James no longcr concealed his diflrufi of the nobles, and fuifered
no opportunity of mortifying them to efcapc. Slight offenccs
-were aggravated into real crimes, and punifhd with severity.
Every accusation against pcrfons of rank was heard with pleasure,

trial proved fatal to those who vwere accused: The banishing I-iep-

ing the cldcPi son of lord Sorbes without fuflicient evidence of his
guilt, and the condemning lady Glamis, a filser of the earl of
Angus, to be burnt for the crime of witchcraft, of which even
that credulous age believed her innocent, are monuments both of
the king's hatred of the nobility, of the fevcrity of his government,
and of the 'lrctches he made towards abfolutc power. By these
a©s of authority, he tried the flirit of the nobles, and how much
they were willing to bear. Their patience increased his contempt
for themi, and added to the ardour and boldncfs with which lie
pursucd his plan. Mleanwhile they obfcrvcd the tendency of his
schemes with concern, and with rcfcntment; but the king's ftga-
city, the vigilance of ills miniflers, and the want of a proper
leader, made it dangerous to concert any mcafures for theihr de-
fence, and impoflible to act with becoming vigour. james and

tiCe clergy dreaded an union, which mufi: have been eftabli.'lcd on
tlhe ruins of the church. HI-enry had taken great pains to infufc
into his neplhew his own1 fenltiincnts concerning religion, and had
frequently solicited hiimi, by abadors, to renounce the Utlliirped
dominion of the pope, which was no lets dilhonourable to princes
than grievous to their fiubjcecs. The clergy had hitherto, with
great addrets, diverted thie king from regarding these solicitations.
But, in an amicable conference, Henry exlpeeced, and they feared,
that James would yield to his entreaties, or be convinced by his
arguments. They knew that the revenues of the church were an
alluring objecQ to a prince who wanted money, and who loved it;
that tlhe pride and ambition of ccclefiafiics raised the indignation
of the nobles ; that tleiir indecent lives gave offence to the people;
that the proteffant opinions wvere 1preading fast throughout the
nation; and that an univcrfal defcdtion from the eflablilhed church
would be the coniequence of giving the finalleft, degree of encou-
ragement to thcfc principles. Por these reasons, they employed
all their credit with the king, and had recouric to every artifice
and insinuation, ill order to divert him from a journey, wvhich mnuP:
have been so fatal to their intere. They endeavoured to illnfire
him with fear, by magnifying- the danger to whicl he would ex-
pofc his person, by venturing so far into England, without any
security but the word of a prince, who having violated every thing
venerable and sacred in religion, was no longer to be trulted;
and by way of compensation for the fiins which he might have
received from Henry, they offered an annual donative of fifty
thousand crowns; they promised to contribute liberally towards car-
rying on a war with England, and flatteled him with the profIpeC

of

tleir contempt of his authority. Scarcity of' proxifions, and the
rigour of the season, having obliged the Ingliil army, which lad
invaded Scotland, to retire, James imagined that lie could attack
them, with great advantage, ill their retreat ; but the principal
barons, with an obstinacy and dilfdain wlhich greatly aggravated
their difobeliencc, refused to advance a ftep beyond the limits of
their own country. Provoked by this insult to hiiifelf, and sus-

one or two of its citizens to appear in tlle name of the corporation;
and the idea of rcprfezntalio?2 was fiift introduced in this manner.
An innovation till more important naturally followed. The
vaifals of the crown were originally few in number, and extremely
powerful; but as it is impoflible to render property fixed and per-
manent, many of their poflefiions came, gradually, and by va-
rious methods of alienation, to be split and parcelled out into
different hands. -Iencc arose the diftincion betwecen the Greater
and the LcrTcr .arons. The former were those who retained their
original fiefs undivided; the latter were the new and less potent
vassals of the crown. Both were bound, however, to perform all
feudal services, and, of confequencc, to give attendance in Par-
liament. To the lefier barons, who formed no inconsiderable
body, this was an intolerable grievance. Barons fometilmes denied
their tenure, boroughs renounced their right of elefting, charters
were obtained containing an exemption from attendance; and the
anxiety with which our anceflors endeavoured to get siee from
the obligation of fitting in parliament, is furpafted by that only
with which their posterity solicit to be admitted there. In order
to accommodate both parties, at once, to secure to the king a sus-
ficient number of members in his great council, and to ihve his
vassals from an unneceflary burden, an easy expedient was found
out. The obligation to personal attendance was continued upon
the greater barons, from which the lesser barons were exempted,
on condition of their eleCting, in each county, a certain number
.of rcprf;jta/ives, to appear in their name. Thus a parliament
became complete in all its members, and was composed of lords
spiritual and temporal, of knights of the flires, and of bur-
gefles. As many causes contributed to bring govrnment earlier

to perfection in England than in Scotland; as the rigour of the 1 i
feudal inrfitutions abated foolnc;, and its dcfeds were fiipplied witlh - --
greater facility in the one kingdom than in tlle other; England
led the way in all these changes, and burgefies and knights of the
fllire appcared in the parliaments of that nation, before they
were hcard of in ours. Bulrgeics were first admitted into the A. D. .;:',
Scottish parliamcnts by R.obcrt Bruce '; and in tlie preamble to tle
laws of Robert III. they are rankled among the conPlitucnt Inclu-
bers of that aflcmbly. The Icfle r barons were indebted to James I. 1i.:,-
for a ftatltc exempting them from pcrlonal attendance, and per-
mitting them- to clct rcprefentatives: the exemption was eagerly
laid hold on ; but the privilege was so little valued, that, except
one or tw.o inflances, it lay negleCed during one hundred and sixty
years; and James VI. firftc obliged them to fend rcprefentativcs
regularly to parliament '.

A SCOTTISI parliament, then, confitted anciently of great

barons, of ecclesiastics, and a few representatives of boroughs.

posed one assembly, in which the lord chancellor prcfidcd '. In

J In England, the peers and commons seem early to have met in separate houses;

and James I. who was fond of imitating the Englifil in all their customs, had pro-
bably an intention of introducing some considerable difliincion between the greatcr
and leflfr barons in Scotland; at least he determined that their consultations should
not be carried on under the direction of the fame president; for by his law, A. D.
1327, it is providlcd, " that out of the commiffioncrs of all the flires shall bc
chofrc a wife and expert man, called the common speaker of the parliament, who
shall propose all and sundry needs and causes pertaining to the commons in the par-
liamlnt or general council." No fulch speaker, it would seem, was ever cholen;
and by a fubfcqucnt law the chancellor was declared perpetual prcfident of par-
liament.

K z m-ude

B o0 K rude ages, when the science of government was extremely irnper-

L~ - rsed among a martial people, unacquainted with the arts of peace,

itrangers to the talents which make a figure in debate, and despising
them, -parliaments were not held in the fame estimation as at pre-
sent; nor did haughty barons love those courts, in which they
appeared with such evident marks of inferiority. Parliamentswere
often haitily assembled, and it was, probably, in the king's power,
by the manner in which he issued his writs for that purpose, to
exclude such as were averse from his measures. At a time when
deeds of violence were common, and the reflraints of law and
decency were little regarded, no man could venture with safety
to oppose the king in his own court. The great barons, or lords
of parliament, were extremely few ; even so late as the beginning
of the reign of James VI. they amounted only to fifty-three.
The ecclefiailics equalled them in number, and being devoted im-
plicitly to the crown, for reasons which have been already ex-
plained, rendered all hopes of vitory in any struggle desperate.
Nor were the nobles themselves so anxious as might be ima-
gined, to prevent ads of parliament favourable to the royal pre-
rogative; conscious of their own strength, and of the kling's ina-
bility to carry these ads into execution without their concurrence,
they trusted either to elude or to contemn them; and the statute
revoking the king's property, and annexing alienated jurifdidions
to the crown, repeated in every reign, and violated and tde1pifed
as often, is a standing proof of the impotence of laws, when op-
posed to power. So many concurring causes are sufficient, perhaps,
to account for the ascendant which our kings acquired in parlia-
ment. But, without having recourse to any of there, a single
circumstance, peculiar to the constitution of the Scottifl parliament,

the mentioning of which we have hitherto avoided, will abundantly B o K
explain this fact, seemingly so repugnant to all our reasonings con- ---- '
cerning the weakncfs of the king, and the power of the nobles.

As far back as our records enable us to trace the constitution of

our parliaments, we find a committee, distinguished by the name
of L sr,'s f Art/icl's. It was their business to prepare and to di-
gcti all mattcrs which were to be laid belore the parliament. There
was rarely any business introduced into parliament, but what had
rpafld through the channel of this committee; every motion for a
new law was ilrft made there, and approved of, or rejeced by t1e,
members of it ; what they approved was formed into a bill, and
presclntcd to parliament ; and it seems probable, that what they
rcjctced could not be introduced into the hoult. This committec
owed the extraordinary powers vested in it, to the military genius
of the ancient noblels; too inpatient to filubmit to the druclldgery oc:
civil bulinelf, too impetuous to obfcrvc the forms, or to cltcr inio
the details nccelliry in conduting it, they wcre glad to lay that
burdein upon a finall number, while they thenifllves had no othc:
Iabour than ftinply to give, or to refuse, their nilaflit to the bi!l'
which wcere preclnted to them. The lords of articles, then, inr
orly dircecd all the proceedings ol parliament, lbut pofeflhd ;
:negative before debate. That committee was cliofen and confLi-
tutcd in fich a manner, as put this valuable privilege entircly in
the king's liands. It is extremely probable, that our klings once
had the folc right of nominating the lords oi articlcs ". T!ey

c atllc

It appears from authentic records, that a parlialent .was eppointed to be held

March 12, 1566, and that the lords of articles were chosen and met on the 7th,
live days before the assembling of parliament. If they could be regularly celetctc
so long before the meeting of parliament, it is natural to conclude, that the prince
alone po0fcnicd the right of clitCing them. There are two diieirent accou.nts of the

B o o 0K came aftcrwards to be elctcd by the parliament, and consisted of

..-I,--.., an equal number out of each estate, and molt commonly of eight

temporal and eight spiritual lords, of eight reprefcntatives of bo-
roughs, and of the eight great officers of the crown. Of this
body, the eight eccclefiaiics, together -with the officers of the
crown, were entirely at the king's devotion, and it was scarce
poflible that the choice could fall on such temporal lords and bur-
gcfls as would unite in opposition to his meafurcs. Capable
either of influencing their elction, or of gaining them when
elected, tle king commonly found the lords of articles no lets ob-
fcquious to his will, than his own privy council, and, by means
of his authority with them, he could put a negative upon his
parliament lefore debate, as well as after it; and what may feemc
altogether incredible, the most limited prince in Europe actually
poflnield, in one infLuice, a prerogative which the mofl- abfolutc
could never attain °

To

manner of their election at that time, one by Mary herself, in a letter to the arch-
bishop of Glasgow: " le, accompanied with our nobility for the time, past to

the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, for holding of our parliament on the 7th day of

" this inflant, amn clclted the lords articulars." If we cxplain these words,
according to the ftJli grammar, we mufr conclude that the queen herself elected
them. It is, however, more probable that Mary meant to fay, that the nobles then
prfelnt with her, viz. her privy counsellors, and others, elected the lords of ar-
ticles. Keith's Hist. of Scotland, p. 331. The other account is Lord Ruthven's,
who expressly aflrms that the queen hcrfelf elec'ed them, Keith's Append. 126.
Whether we embrace the one or the other of there opinions, is of no consequence.
If the privy counsellors and nobles attending the court had a right to elce the lords
of articles, it was equally advantageous for the crown, as if the prince had had the
folc nomination of them.

° Having deduced the history of the committee of lords of articles as low as

the s'ubjec of this preliminary book required, it may be agreeable, perhaps, to some
of my readers, to know the fuibfcquent variations in this singular inflitution, and
the political use which our kings made of these. XVhen parliaments became more
numerous, and more considerable by the admiflion of the reprcfentatives of the lefllr

that period, where the following history commences. A tho- rope at tile

beginning of

barons, the prefcrving their influence over the lords of articles became, likewise, ccntury.
a;l object of greater importance to our kings. James VI. on pretence that the lords
of articles could not find leisure to confider the great multitude of aftairs lnid before
them, obtained an ah, appointing four perfbns to be named out of eachli /a/, wiho
should meet twenty days before the commencemeni of parliamcent ', to receive all
supplications, &c. and rcjcling what they thought frivolou, fliould cngrcfs inl .
book whalt they thought worthy the attention of the lords of articles. No pro-
viSion is ml.lde in the a&t for the choice of this felcct body, and the king would, of
coiarle, have claimed that privilege. In I633, when Charles I. was beginning to
introduce those innovations which gave lb much oiffence to the llation, lie dreaded
tile opposition of his paulialment, and in order to prevent that, all artifice was nmade
une of to secure the lords of articles for the crown. TIhe temporal peers were
appointed to choose cight biliops, and the bishops eight peers; thci l fxtcen met
togethcr, and eleiced eight knights of the shire, and cight hburgcels, andl to thcf
the crown officcrs were atded as ufuial. if we can only fuppole cight perlbns of tb

the court, tthle,, it is obvious, would be the men wlhom the biillops would chooti,
and of conficquence the whole lords of articles were the tools andl creatucule of the-
king. This practice, To inconifirent with liberty, was abolifned dur-in; the ci.'il
war: and the statute of James VI. was repealed. After the reltoarti')n, par-
liaicents became more fcrvile than ever. What was only a temporary device, irn

J 0 0 K rough knowledge of that general system, of which every kilngldonr
_ ....... in Eiurope forms a part, is not less requisite towards understanding

the liiftory of a nation, than an acquaintance with its peculiar go-
vcrlnment and lasws. The latter niay enable us to comprehend
domelftic occurrences and revolutions; but without the former,
foreign tranfations mufi be altogether myf-crious and unintel-
ligible. By attending to this, many dark passages in our hifiory
may be placed in a clear light; and where the bull of historians
havc fcen only the effcE, we may be able to discover the cauce.

TH-E fubvc-rion of the feudal government in France, and its

declension in the ncighbouring kingdoms, occasioned a remarkable
alteration in the political ifate of Europe. Kingdoms, which
were inconsiderable when broken, and parcelled out among nobles,
acquired frninefs and ilrength, by being united into a regular
monlarchy. Kings became conscious of their own power and
importance. They meditated schemes of conquest, and engaged
in wars at a distance. Numerous armies were raised, and great
taxes imposed for thcir subsistence. Considerable bodies of in-
fantry were kept in constant pay; that service grew to be honour-
able; and cavalry, in which the strength of European armies had
hitherto consisted, though proper enough for the short and volun-
tary excursions of barons who served at their own expence, were
found to be unfit either for making or defending any important
conquest.

IT was in Italy, that the powerful monarchs of France and Spain

and Germany first appeared to make a trial of their new strength.
The division of that country into many frall flates, the luxury of
the people, and their effeminate aversion to arms, invited their
more martial neighbours to an easy prey. The Italians, who had

been
7

been accufrtolmd to mock battles only, and to decide their interior B 0 0 K
quarrels by innocent and bloodless vidtories, were aftoniillcd, _, .
\lwhnc the Prench invadcd their country, at the light of real war;
andl as they coult not refrif the torrent, they 'uflfercd it to take its
courfc, and to fpeind its rage. Intrigue and policy supplied the
vwant of ftrcngthl. Ncceflity and fclf-prc1ervation led tliat ingenious
people to the great iccret of modern politics, by teaching them how
to balance tlhe powcr of one pi-iucc, by tlrowing tliat of another
iito the oppoflte fealc. By this happy device, the liberty of Italy
was long plrclcrvcd. The feales were poiled by very fkilfl hands;
the fiiallflt variations were attended to, and no prince was allowed
to retain any fupcriority, tlat could be dangcrous.

A SYSTEiI of conlduc- , pursucd with so much success in Italy,

was not long confined to that country of political refinement. The
maxim of preserving a balance of power is founded so much upon
obvious rcafoning, and the situation of Europe rendered it so ne-
cefl.iry, that it soon became a matter of chief attention to all wife
politicians. Every flep any prince took was observed by all his
neighbours. Ambafiadors, a kind of honourable spies, authorised
by the mutual jcaloufy of kings, resided almost constantly at every
differcnt court, and had it in charge to watch all its motions.
Dangers wvcre forefcen at a greater distance, and prevented with
more cale. Confederacies were formed to humble any power
whlich role above its due proportion. Revenge or felf-defence were
no longer the only causes of hostility, it became common to take
arms out of policy; and war, both in its commencemc nt and in
its operations, was more an exercise of the judgment, than of the
paflions of men. Almost every war in Europe became general,
and the most inconsiderable states acquired importance, because
they could add weight to either scale,

Vo0L 1. 1, FRANCIS

B o o I: FRANCIS I. who mounted the throne of France in the year one

_--- _ thouland five hundred and fifteen, and Charles V. who obtained

the Imperial Crown in the year one thousand five hundred and
nineteen, divided between them the firength and afifccions of all
Europe. Their perpetual enmity was not owing solely either to
perfonlal jeioufy, or to the caprice of private paffon, but was
founded so much in nature and true policy, that it subsisted be-
tween their pofl erity for several ages. Charles succeeded to all the
dominions of the houfi of Auflria. No family had ever gained
so muchl by wiie and fortunate marriages. By acquisitions of this
kind the Au.ilrianl princes rose, in a short time, fromn obfciure
counts of r'Hap-boulr, to be archdukles of AuPiria and kinlgs of
i3ohemia, and Iwere in poffiLfion of the Imperial dignity by a sori
of hereditary right. Becfides these territories in Germany, Charles
was heir to the crown of Spain, and to all the dominions which
belonged to the lioufe of Blurgundy. The Burgundian provinces
cungroiled, atthat time, the riches and commerce of one half of
-urope ; and lie drew from then, on many occasions, tlofe ini
-nmerl fums, which no people itlout trade and liberty are able
to contribute. Spain flrnil'ied lhm a gallant and hardy infa;trly
to whose discipline he was indebted for all his conqu.elis. At
the fame time, by the dliscovery of the new world, a vein of
wealth ,was opened to him, which all the extravagance of anl.i-
tion could not exhaufn. Trhec advantages relndered Charles the
Irrft prince in Eu;rc1pe; but he wished to be more, and opcly
ai;ired to univerlil monarchy. H-is genius was of that kind
v.:hich ripens foowly, and lies long concealed ; but it grew up,
withlout ocbfer-vatioo, to an unexpectd height and vigour. i-e

many of the emperor's designs.

TIIE retU of Europe obfcrvcd all the motions of these mighty

rivals with a jealous attention. On the one fidc, tlh Italians fawr
the dianger which threatened Chriflendom, and in order to avert
it, had rccourfe to the expedient which they had often employed
with success. They cndeavoured to divide the power of the two
contending monarchs into equal scales, and, by the union of several
small states, to countcrpoife him whose power became too great.
But whlat they concerted with much wisdom, they were able to
execute with little vigour; and intrigue and refinement were feeble
fences against the incroachments of military power.

ON the other fide, HenryVIII. of England held the balance
with lcs delicacy, but with a stronger hand. He was the third

L 2 prince

B 0 0 I prince of the age in dignity and in power; and the advantageous
"^- - situation of his dominions, his domestic tranquillity, his immenfc

wealth, and absolute authority, rendered him the natural guardian
of the liberty of Europe. Each of the rivals courted him with
emulation; he knew it to be his interest to keep the balance even,
and to restrain both, by not joining entirely with either of them.
But he was seldom able to reduce his ideas to pracice; lie was
governed by caprice more than by principle; and the pallions of
the man were an overmatch for the maxims of the king. Vanity
and resentment were the great springs of all his undertakings, and
his neighbours easily found the way, by touching tlefe, to force
him upon many rafli and inconfiften enterpriiis. I-is. reigrn was
a perpetual series of blunders in politics; and while he esteemed
himself the wisest prince in Europe, he was a constant dupe to those
who found it neceflary, and could fuibmit, to flatter him,

IN this situation of Europe, Scotland, which had hitherto waftcc

her strength in the quarrels between France and England, emergce
from her obscurity, took her Peation in the system, and began to
have oime influence upon the fate of distant nations. -Ier afitl-
ance was frequently of consequence to. the contending parties, and
the balance was often so nicely adjufled, that it was in her power'
to make it lean to either fide. The part assigned her, at this junc-
ture, was to divert Henry from carrying his arms into the con-
tinent. That prince having routed the French at Guinegat and
invested Teroucinne, France attempted to divide his forces, by
engaging James IV. in that unhappy expedition which ended with
his life. For the fame reason Francis encouraged and afiflted the
duke of Albany to ruin the families of Angus and IHome, which
were in the interest of England, and would willingly have per-
fuaded the Scots to revenge the death of their king, and to. enter

into

into a new war with that kingdom. Henry and Francis having 1B IO I
united not long after against the emperor, it was the interest of ---
both kings, that the Scots flhould continue inactivc; and a long
tranquillity was the cfucl- of their union. Charles endeavoured
to break this, and to cmbarrafis Henry by another inroad of the
Scots. For this end he made great advances to [ames V. flatter-
ing the vanity of the young monarch, by clctcing himii a knight
of the Golden Fleece, and by otffrin hinim a match in the Imperial
family ; while, in return for thefl elmpty honours, he demanded
of him to renounce his alliance vwihi Franlcc, and to declare war
agnaiinfl England. !But James, who hadl mIuch to lol, and who
could gain little by closing with the emperor's prol:oltls, rcjcicd
them with decency, and keeping firm to his ancient allies, left
Icnry at full liberty to al upon tlhe continent with his whole
firength.

HIE NR:lY himself began his reign by imitating the example oY

his anccifors with regard to Scotland. HIe held its power in l:fic
extreme contempt, that he was at no pains to gain its fricndflip;
but, on the contrary, he irritated the whole nation, by reviving
the antiiquattcd pretcnfions of the crown of England to the lovc--
lcignty over Scotland. But his own experience, and the example
of his enemies, gave him a higher idea of its importance. It was
impofiible to defend an. open and extenfivc frontier against the
incursions of an aclive and martial people. During any war on the
continent, this obliged him to divide the strength of his kingdom.
It was nccefiary to maintain a kind of army of observation in the
North of England ; and after all precautions, the Scottish borderers,
who were superior to all mankind in the practice of irregular war,
often made liccefsful inroads, and spread terror and desolation over
many counties. He fcll, at last, upon the true secret of policy,

with

, 0 o with lrcfpedr to Scotland, which his predecefllbrs had too little pc-
Lc_.. . net-ration to difcovcr, or too muchl pride to employ. The fitua-

tion of the country, and the bravery of the people, made the
conoluct of Scotland iinpoilible; but the national poverty, and
the violence of fadion, rendered it an easy matter to divide,
and to govern it. He abandoned, therefore, the former design,
and resolved to employ his utmost address in executing the
latter. It had not vet become honourable for one prince to receive
pay from another, under the more decent name of a subsidy.
But in all ages the fame arguments have been good in courts, and
of weight with miniflers, fadtious leaders, and favourites. M/hat
were the arguments by which Henry brought over so many to his
intcrefl during the minority of James V. we know by the original
warrant flill extant P, for remitting considerable funms into Scotland.
By a proper dillribution of there, many persons of note were gained
to his party, and a facion which held secret correspondence with
England, and received all its directions from thence, appears hence-
forward in our domeflic contests. In the fcquel-of the history, we
flall find Henry labouring to extend his influence in Scotland.
His fucceflors adopted the fame plan, and improved upon it. The
affairs of the two kingdoms became interwoven, and their interests
were often the fame. Elizabeth divided her attention almost
equally between them, and the authority which she inherited in the
one, was not greater than that which she acquired in the other.

o I Tle government of an infant queen was still more destitute of real

-v' authority; and the profpedt of a long and feeble minority invited

to faCtion by the hope of impunity. James had not even pro-
vided the common remedy against the disorders of a minority, by
committing to proper persons the care of his daughter's education,
and the adminifhration of affairs in her name. Though lhe saw
the clouds gathering, and foretold that they would quickly burst
into a storm, he was so little able to disperse them, or to defend
his daughter and kingdom against the imminent calamities, that,
in Imere dcfpair, he abandoned them both to the mercy of fortune,
and left open to every pretender, the office of regent, which he
could not si to his own latistfacion.

vourite of the nation. Those among the nobles who wished for a
reformation in religion dreaded his severity, and others confidered
the elevation of a churchman to the highest office in the kingdom
as a depression of thenfelves. At their instigation, James Hamilton
earl of Arran, and next heir to the queen, rouled himself from
his inacdivity, and was prevailed on to aspire to that flation, to
which proximity of blood gave him a natural title. The nobles,

ra&er, than the earl of Arran and cardinal Beatoun. The cardinal
was by nature of immoderate ambition; by long experience he had
acquired address and refinement; and infolcnce grew upon him
from continual Iiiccefs. His high station in the church placed him
in the way of great civil employments; his abilities were equal to
the greatelt of thcfe; nor did he reckon any of them to be above
his merit. As his own eminence was founded upon the power of
the church of Rome, he was a zealous defender of that superstition,
and for the fame reason an avowed enemy to the doctrine of the re-
formers. Political motives alone determined him to support the
one, or to oppose the other. His early application to public bufi-
ness kept him unacquainted with the learning and controversies of
the age; he gave judgment, however, upon all points in dispute,
with a precipitancy, violence, and rigour, which contemporary
hiflorians mention with indignation.

TIIE character of the earl of Arran was, in almost every thing, of Arran,

the reverse of Beatoun's. IHe was neither infected with ambition,
nor inclined to cruelty: The love of cafe extinguished the former,
the gentleness of his temper preserved him from the latter. Ti-
midity and irresolution were his predominant failings, the one occa-
sioned by his natural constitution, and the other arising from a con-
:cioufnefs that his abilities were not equal to his Ration. With these
dilfofitions he might have enjoyed and adorned private life; but

.-=---i ence. The perpetual slave of his own fears, and, by consequence,

the perpetual tool of those who found their advantage in pradcif-
ing upon them. But as no other person could be set in opposition to
the cardinal, with any probability of success, the nation declared
in his favour with fucli general content, that the artifices of his
rival could not withstand its united strength.

to events of the mort fatal consequence to limfelf, and to the
kingdom. After the death of James, I-Ienry VIII. was no longer
afraid of any interruption from Scotland to his designs against
France; and inimediately conceived hopes of rendering this fe-
curity perpetual, by the marriage of Edward his only son with the
young queen of Scots. I-Ie communicated his intention to the
prisoners taken at Solway, and prevailed on them to favour it, by
the promise of liberty, as the reward of their success. In the
mean time he permitted them to return into Scotland, that, by
their prefcnce in the parliament which the regent had called, they
might be the better able to persuade their countrymen to fall in
with his proposals. A cause, intrufled to such able and zealous
advocates, could not well miss of coming to an happy issue. All
those who feared the cardinal, or who desired a change in religion,
were fond ofan alliance, vwhich afforded prote&cion to the dorine

had betrayed the kingdom to its molt inveterate enemies, and
sacrificed its honour to his own ambition. He foretold the ex-
tinction of the true catholic religion, under the tyranny of an
excommunicated heretic; but above all, he lamented to fee an
ancient kingdom consenting to its own servitude, descending into
the ignominious station of a dependent province; and, in one hour,
the wcaknefs or treachery of a single man surrendering every thing
for which the Scottish nation had struggled and fought during so
many ages. These remonstrances of the cardinal were not withi-
out effet. They were addressed to prejudices and pafions which
are deeply rooted in the human heart. The fame hatred to the
ancient enemies of their country, the fame jealousy of national
honour, and pride of independence, which, at the beginning of
the present century, went near to prevent the Scots from con-
senting to an union with England, upon terms of great advantage,
did at that time induce the whole nation to declare against the
alliance which had been concluded. In the one period, an hun-
dred and fifty years of peace between the two nations, the habit
of being fubjeted to the fame king, and governed by the fame
maxims, had considerably abated old animofities, and prepared
both people for incorporating. In the other, injuries were still
frcfh, the wounds on both fides were open, and in the warmth
of resentment, it was natural to seek revenge, and to be averse from
reconcilement. At the Union in one thousand seven hundred and
seven, the wisdom of parliament despised the groundless murmurs
occasioned by antiquated prejudices; but in one thousand five
hundred and forty-three, the complaints of the nation were better
founded, and urged with a zeal and unanimity, which it is neither

just

just nor safe to diliregard. A rafl measure of tle king of England 13B o K
added greatly to the violence of this national animosity. The
Scots, relying on the treaty of marriage and union, fitted out
several ships for France, with which their trade had been inter-
rupted for some time. These were driven by stress of weather to
take refuge in different ports of England; and Henry, under
pretext that they were carrying provisions to a kingdom with
which he was at war, ordered them to be leized and condemned
as lawful prizes . The Scots, aflonifhed at this proceeding of a
prince, whose intcrefl it was manifefIly, at tlat juncture, to court
and to sooth them, felt it not only as an injury, but as an insult,
and exprcfelcd all the rcfentment natural to an high-fpirited people ".
Their rage rose to such an height, that the English ambaflador
could hardly be protected from it. One spirit fcbmed now to

d In the MS. Collclion of Papers belonging to the Duke of IHamilton, Sir

Ralph Sadler def-ribes the spirit of the Scots as extremcly outrageous. In his letter
from Edinburgh, September i, I5o 3, he fays, " The Ilay of the ships has brought the
people of this town, both men and v.omen, and especially the merchants, iiito such
a rage and fury, that the whole town is commoved agaiinii me, and swear great
oaths, that if their ships are not restorcd, that they would have their amends of me
and mine, and that they would Iet my house here on fire over my lhed, lb that one
of us flould not escape alive; and allo it hath much incensed and provoked the
people againif the governor, faying, that he hath coloured a peace with your lIa-
jefty only to undo them. This is the unreasonableness of the people, which live here
infuch a beastly liberty, that they neither regard God nor governor ; nor yetjuftice,
or any good policy, doth take place among them; alluring your highness that,
unless the ships be delivered, there will be none abiding here for me without danger."
Vol. 451. In his letter of September 5, he writes, that the rage of the people
flill continued so violent, " that neither I nor any of my folks dare go out of my
doors; and the provost of the town, who hath much ado to stay them from assault-
ing me in my house, and keepeth watch therefore nightly, hath sent to me sundry
times, and prayed me to keep myself and my folks within, for it is scant in his
power to rcprcfs or resist the fury of the people. They fay plainly, I shall never pars
out of the town alive, except they have their ships restored. This is the rage and
beaft!inefs of this nation, which God keep all honel men from." Ib. 471.

~-...J.. gr-cat rum towards prcferving the church from the dominion of a

princc, whose Iyflemr of reformation was so fatal to their power.
The nobles, after having mortified the cardinal so lately in fuclh a
cruel manner, were now ready to applaud and to fccond him, as
the defender of the honour and liberty of his country.

mother, and added to his party the splendour and authority of the
royal name . He received, at the ifame time, a more real accession
to his ftrcngth, by the arrival of Matthew Stewart earl of Lennox,
whose return from France he had earnestly solicited. This young
nobleman was the hereditary enemy of the house of Hamilton. IHe
had many claims upon the regent, and pretended a right to cx--
elude him, not only from succeeding to the crown, but to deprive
him of the poffIffion of his private fortune. The cardinal flattered
his vanity with the profplet of marrying the queen dowager, and
aftifced to treat him with to much refiecc, that the rceent became
jealous of him as a rival in power.

Tins suspicion was artfully heightened by the abbot of Paisley

who returned into Scotland some time before the earl of Lennox,
and aced in concert with the cardinal. He was a natural brother
of the regent, with whlom he had great credit; a warm partisan of
IFrance, and a zealous defender of the eftablifiled religion. He took
hold of the regent by the proper handle, and endeavoured to bring
about a change in his Ientiments, by working upon his fears. The

JMEANWHIILE, the day appointed for the ratification of the

treaty with England, and the delivery of the heftages, approached,
and the regent was still undetermined in his own mind. He acted

aiid to porfC- .SOON after this sudden revolution in his political principles, the
forc he rze regent changed his sentiments concerning religion. The spirit of

controversy was then new and warm; books of that kind were
eagerly read by men of every rank ; the love of novelty, or the
conviction of truth, had led the regent to express great esteem for
the writings of the reformers; and having been powerfully sup-
ported by those who had embraced their opinions, he, in order to
gratify them, entertained in his own family two of the most noted
preachers of the protestant doctrine, and in his first parliament,
consented to an act, by which the laity were permitted to read
the scriptures in a language which they understood h. Truth
needed only a fair hearing to be an over-match for error. Ab-
furdities, which had long imposed on the ignorance and credulity
of mankind, were detected and exposed to public ridicule; and
under the countenance of the regent, the reformation made great
advances. The cardinal observed its progress with concern, and
was at the utmost pains to obftrud it. He represented to the
regent his great imprudence in giving encouragement to opinions
so favourable to Lennox's pretensions; that his own legitimacy
depended upon the validity of a sentence of divorce, founded
on the pope's authority; and that by suffering it to be called in
queflion, he weakened his own title to the succession, and fur-
nifhed his rival with the only argument by which it could be ren-

B 0 i earl of Arran, who having by his inconstancy forfeited the public
t-.J-- esteem, was contemned by one half of the nation, and little trusted

by the other. The pretcnfions of the earl of Lennox were the
only thing which remained to embarrass him. I-Ie had very fuc-
cefsfuliy made use of that nobleman to work upon the regent's
jealousy and fear, but as he no longer stood in need of such an
infirumcnt, le was willing to get rid of him with deccncy,
Lennox soon began to suspect his intention; promises, flattery,
and rcfpcd-, were the only returns he had hitherto received for
fubllantial ferviccs; but at last the cardinal's artifices could no
longer be concealed, and Lennox, instead of attaining power and
dignity himlflf, llw that he had been employed only to procure
thcfc for another. Refcntmcnt and disappointed ambition urged
him to fcek rev-enge on that cunning prelate, who, by sacrificing his
intereli-, had ib ungenerously purchased the earl of Arran's fiiend-
:ship. Ie vithdrew, for that reason, from court, and declared
for the party at enmity with the cardinal, which, with open arms,
received a convert who added so much luftrc to their cause.

Ti'II two Ilacions iwhich divided the kingdom were flill the fame,

without any alterations in their views or principles; but by one of
tlofic flrange revolutions which were frequent in that age, they
had, in the course of a few weeks, changed their leaders. The
regent was at the head of the partisans of France and the defenders
of popery, and Lennox in the fame station with the advocates for
the Englifli alliance, and a reformatiou in religion. The one
laboured to pull down his o\;wn work, lwhich the other upheld
with the fame hand that had hitherto endeavoured to defiroy it.

and with his land forces retired safely to the English borders, de-
livering the kingdom, in a few days, from the terror of an invasion,
concerted with little policy, carried on at great expencc, and at-
tended with no advantage. If Henry aimed at the conquefi of
Scotland, he gained nothing by this expedition; if the marriage
lhe had proposed was flill in his view, he loft a great deal. Such
a rough courtship, as the earl of Huntly humorously called it, dif-
gustcd the whole nation; their aversion for the match grew into
abhorrence; and, cxafperated by so many indignities, the Scots
were never at any period more attached to France, or more alien-
ated from England.

TrIE carl of Lennox alone, in spite to the regent and French

king, continued a corrcfpondence with England, which ruined
his own interefl, without promoting I-Ienry's '. Many of his
own vassals, preferring their duty to tleir country before their
affcetion to him, refuted to concur in any design to favour the
public enemy. After a few feeble and unsuccessful attempts to
disturb the regent's adminifiration, he was obliged to fly for safety
to the court of England, where Henry rewarded services which
he had the inclination, but not the power to perform, by giving
him in marriage his niece the lady Margaret Douglas. This
unhappy exile, however, was deflined to be the father of a race
of kings. I-e ma his son lord Darnley mount the throne of Scot-
land, to the perpetual exclusion of that rival who now triumphed
in his ruin. From that time his posterity have held the sceptre
in two kingdoms, by one of which he was cast out as a criminal,
and by the other received as a fugitive.

; o 0o i and inactive war, by a peace, in which England, France, and Scot-
i.',_J.. land were comprehended. Henry laboured to exclude the Scots

from the benefit of this treaty, and to reserve them for that venge-
ance which his attention to the afltirs of the continent had hitherto
delayed. But although a peace with England was of the lafc con-
sequence to Francis I. whom the emperor was preparing to attack
with all his forces, he was too generous to abandon allies who had
Icrvcd him with fidelity, and he chose rather to purchase Henry's
fi-iendfiip with difadcvantage to himself, than to leave them exposcd
to danger. By yielding some things to the interest, and more to
the vanity of that haughty prince ; by submission, flattery, and
address, he at length prevailed to have the Scots included in the
peace agreed upon.

hie murdcr AN event which happened a short time before the conclusion of
ot lI;etoun.

this peace, rendered it more acceptable to the whole nation. Car-
dinal Beatoun had not uscd his power with moderation, equal to
the prudence by whichl he attained it. Notwithitanding his great
abilities, he had too many of the paIlions and prejudices of an
angry leader of a fadcion, to govern a divided people with temper.
-lis relentmcnt againfl one party of the nobility, his inollence to-
wards the reft, his fevcrity to the reformers, and, above all, the
barbarous and illegal execution of the famous George WVifhart, a
man of honourable birth and of primitive fandity, wore out the
patience of a fierce age; and nothing but a bold hand was wanting
to gratify the public wish by his deflruCtion. Private revenge,
inflamed and fanicificd by a false zeal for religion, quickly flipplied
this want. Norman Lefly, the cldfcr son of the earl of Rothes,
had been treated by the cardinal with injuitice and contempt. It
was not the temper of the man, or the spirit of the times, quietly
to digest an affront. As the profeflion of his adversary fIreened

h~imr

him fromI the efltc's of what is called an honourable rcteiutmcnt, Cn 0 ° K
he rciflved to take that fatisfadlion which he could not demand. ·-- ---
This rclolution defervcs as much censure, as the singular courage
and conductL with which he put it in CxCcution excite wonder.
The cardinal at that time rcfided in tlic caflce of Saint 'Andrcw's,
whichll he had fortilied at -great ex-pncc, andt in the opinion of the
age had rendcrced it impregnable. H-Iis retinue was numerous, the
to.wn at his devotion, and thi neighbourling country full of his de--
pendents. In tlis litnation, fixtceni pcrbl'ns undertoolk to furprifc
his caflIc, and to afhildinatc lhimfilf; alnd their ifuccct was

v equal to

the boldncl; of the attempt. Early in the morning they Icized Ir,.a.I
on tile gate of the caflle, which was iet open to the workmen Vwho I '1
were employed in lininfing the fortifications ; and having placed
sentries at the door of the cardinal's apartment, they awakened his
numerlous domneflics one by olle, and turning them out of the caflec,
they, without noilf or tumult, or violence to any other pecrfor,
delivered their country, though by a mos uinjtflifiable aclioil,
from an ambitious man, wholfe pride was intllpportable to tile
nobles, as his cruelty and cunning were great chccks to the rc-
ormnatio0n.

I-Is death was fatal to the catholic religion, and to tlic French Tiie rechi,

intcrerc in Scotlanid. The ialme zeal for both continued among a I'li, t, .
great party in the nation, but when deprived of the

e genius anld , ut-

authority of lo flilfill a leader, operated withl lels ctll. Nothing
can cqual the consternation which a blowv tI unexpeCtd occasioned
among fitch as were attached to him; while the regent fecrctly
enijoced an event, which removed out of his way a rival, who had
not only cclipfcd his ,reatunets, but alimoi cxtinguifi-edt his power.

'-- ----' the cardinal had detained for some time at Saint Andrew's, in

pledge of his fidelity, and who, together with the castle, had allen
into the hands of the conspirators, induced him to take arms, in
order to rcvcnge the death of a man whom he hated.

I-IE threatened vengeance, but was unable to execute it. One

part of military fcicncc, the art of attacking fortified places, was
then imperfctly underrfood in Scotland. The weapons, the dif-
ciplinc, and irmpctuofity of the Scots, rendered their armies as
unfit for ficges, as they wcre acive in the field. An hundred
and fifty ncn, which was the greatcft numnber the conspirators
ever aflcinbled, refited all the efforts of the regent for five
months :, in a place which a single battalion, with a few battering
cannon, would now reduce in a few hours. This tedious liege
was concluded by a truce. The regent undertook to procure for
the conspirators an absolution from the pope, and a pardon in par-
liament; and upon obtaining theti, they engaged to surrender the
cafilc, and to cft his son at liberty.

IT is probable, that neither of them were finccre in this treaty.

On both fides they fought only to amufc, and to gain time. The
regent had applied to France for affiftancc, and cxpected soon to
have the conlpirators at mercy. On the other hand, if Lcfly and
his affociatcs were not at firfl incited by H-enry to murder the car-
dinal, they were, in the sequel, powerfully supported by him.
Notwithstanding the silence of contemporary hiflorians, there are
violent presumptions of the formcr; of the latter there is un-
doubted certainty ". During the siege, the conspirators had received
from England supplies both of money and provisions; and as

virtues of others. His rapaciouliiefs, his profusion, and even his
tyranny, by deprehing the ancient nobility, and by adding new
property and power to the commons, laid or ftrcetgthcned the
foundations of the British liberty. His other passions contributed
no less towards the downfhl of popery, and the efiablihlinent of
religious freedom in the nation. His refcntmcnt led hiln to abolifli

them this important prize. The presumptive heir to the crown in
the hands of the avowed enemies of the kingdom, was a dreadful

IN the beginning of SeptemberCi , tlh carl of -Hertford, now duke Scotland in-

of Somcinrlt, and protedor of F.ngland, entered Scotland at the Englilh
hicad of cightccn thouhand men, and, at the iame time, a fleet of
lixty hlips appeared on the coall to fccond his land forces. The
Scots had for foi- b time oblervcd this ftorin gathering, and were
prepared for it. Their armly was almofl: double to that of the
cncey, and potled to the greatest advantage on a rising ground,
above lMuftIlburgh, not far from the banks of the river IEfe.
Both there circuifl-ances alarmed the duke of Somerset, wlho fai
his dallner, and would willingly have extricated himself out of it,
by a new overture of peace, on conditions extremely rea[onable.
But this moderation being ilmputed to fear, his propoflils were
rejecctd with that scorn which tihe confidence of success inl)fircs ;
and if the conduct of the regent, who commanded the Scottish

0 2 army,

B 0 0 K army, had been in any degree equal to his confidence, the de-
_-.-.-- fltruition of the English must have been inevitable. They were

in a situation precisely similar to that of their countrymen under
Oliver Cromwell in the following century. The Scots had chofcn
their ground so well, that it was impoflible to force them to
give battle; a few days had exhausted the forage and pro-
vilion of a narrow country; the fleet could only firnifil a
tcanty and precarious subsistence ; a retreat therefore was ne-
cefary; but disgrace, and perhaps ruin, were the consequences of
retreating.

ON both these occasions, the national heat and impetuosity of

the Scots saved the Englifli, and precipitated their own country
into the utmofl danger. The undifciplilnd courage of the private
men became impatient at the fight of an enemy. The general
-was afraid of nothing, but that the Englifl might escape from

Battle of himi by flight; and leaving his flrong camp, he attacked the duke
Pinkecy, September of Somerset near Pinkey, with no better success than his rashness

eminence, and had now the advantage of ground on his fide.
The Scottifi army confited almost entirely of infantry, whose
chief weapon was a long spear, and for that reason their files were
very deep and their ranks close. They advanced towards the
enemy in three great bodies, and, as they pafied the river, were
considerably exposcd to the fire of the English fleet, which lay in
the bay of Muffelburgh, and had drawn near the shore. The
English cavalry, fluffhed with an advantage which they had
gained in a skirmish some days before, began the attack with
more impetuosity than good conduc. A body so firm and com-
pa& as the Scots easily resifted the impreflion of cavalry, broke
them, and drove them off the field. The English infantry, how-

ever,

ever, advanced, and the Scots were at once exposed to a flight of B °0 0
arrows, to a fire ill flankl fiom four hundred forcign fufilccrs who L-v----0
servcd the enemy, and to their cannon, which were planted be-
hind the infantry on the highcll part of the eminence. 'The depth
and clofenclis of their orderl making it impofible for the Scots to
fland long in this situation, thc carl of An s, wh-lo commanlded
the vang:it'd, cndleavourcd to change hiis ground, and to 1rtire
towards the main body. But lis fiiends unhappily miloolk his
motion for a flight, and fell into confusion. At that very inflant,
the broken cavalry, having rallied, returned to the charigc; the foot
purl-ut the advantage they liad gained ; lie pirof]ic of vicctory
redoubled the ardou11r of both : And in a moment the rout of tlhe
Scottili army became univcrfal and irretrievable. The encounter
in the siecl dwas not long nor bloody; but in the purfiit, the Enllifl
dilcovered all the rage and ficrcenefs whicl national antipathy,
kinidlcdc by loln emulation, and inflamcd by reciprocal injuries, is
apt to infllire. Tic piurlit was continued for five hours, and to
a great dlillance. All the three roads by which the Scots fled, were
ircvecd witlh pears, and fiords, and targets, and covcrcd wtith
the bodies of the slain. Above ten thouland men fell on this day,
one of tlhe most fatal Scotland had ever fene. A few were taken
prisoners, and among thlefe lomc pcrfons of diflindion. The
protccdor had it now in his power to become mafcer of a kingdom,
out of which, not many hours before, he was almost obliged to

were acceflible by ita, he would have laid the kingdom open to
the l nglifh, and, in a flort time, the Scots muI t either have
accepted of his terms, or have submitted to his power. By such
anl improvement of it, tle viaory at Dunbar gave Cromwell the
command of Scotland. The battle of Pinkey had no other effect
but to precipitate the Scots into newv engagements with France.
'lic' situation of the Engliifh court may, indeed, be pleaded in

few or none, and appoint their fight most commonly always a-foot. They come to the
field well furniflicd all with jack and skull, dagger and buckler, and swords all broad
niid thil, of exceeding good temper, and universally so made to slice, that as I nctcr
lawv none so good, lb I think it halrd to devise the better. Hereto every man his pike,
.and a great kcrcher wrapped twice or thrice about his neck, not for cold, but for
crllting. In their array towards joining with the enemy, they cling and thrust so
.near in the fore rank, fiouldicr and fbouldcr together, with their pikes in both their
hands llraihlt aore them, and their followers in that order so hard at their backs,
laying their pikes over their forcgoers floulders, that if they do afilil undifcovcied,
no force can well withstand them. Standing at defence they thrust floulders likewise
so nigh together, the fore ranks well nigh to kneeling, tfoop low before, their fellows
behind holding their pikes with both hands, and therewith in their left their bucklers,
the one end of their pike against their right foot, and the other against the enemy
breaft-high; their followcrs crofling their pike points with theml forward ; and thus
each with other so nigh as fpacc and place will fuflcr, through the whole ward, so
thick, that as cafily lhall a bare finger pierce through the flcin of an angry hedge-hog,
as any encounter the front of their pikes." Other curious particulars are found in

with I,'' ancc

dinal Beatoun, Mary of Guise, the queen doswager, took a con-
fiidcerable lhare in the dire&ion of aftairs. She was warmly attached
by blood, and by inclination, to the Frcench interefl; and, in order
to promote it, improved with great dexterity every event which
occurred. 'The I)irit and flrength of tih Scots were broken at
Pinkcy; and in an afnembly of nobles which met at Stirling to
consult upon the situation of the kingdom, all eyes were turned
towards France, no prolipcc of fafcty appearing but in afiflancc
from thence. But I-Icnry II. being then at peace with England,
the queecn rcprefented that they could not cxpedc: him to take part
in their quarrel, but upon views of personal advantage ; and that
w'itlhout extraordinary coiccflions in hi]: li vour, no afliri'ane, ill
proportion to their prcefn' cexigencies, could be obtained. T'he
prejudices of the nation towcrfilly fIeconded tlhel rcprfelatjions
of the queen. What often happens to individuals, took place

4 lam ono-

B o IK among the nobles in this convention; they were slvayed en-
·---.--. tirely by their paflions; and in order to gratify them, they dc-

ferted their former principles, and disregarded their true intercit.
In tlhe violence of rcfentment, they forgot that zeal for the inde-
pendence of Scotland, which had prompted them to rejet the

nnd to oiFcr proposals of IIenry VIII.; and by offering, voluntarily, their
their quc, n
in mnarrige young ,queen in marriage to the dauphin, cldef soon of Henry II.,
to the dau-
phin. and, which was flill more, by propoling to fend her immediately

into France to be educated at his court, they granted, fi-om a
thirLf of vengeance, what formerly they would not yield upon
any consideration of their own safety. To gain at once such a
kingdom as Scotland, was a matter of no small consequence to
France. IHenry, without hesitation, accepted the offers of the
Scottilh ambassadors, and prepared for the vigorous defence of his
new acquisition. Sis thousand veteran soldiers, under the cornm-
mand of Monsieur Defse, assisted by tome of the best officers who
were formed in the long wars of Francis I. arrived at Leith. They
:frved two campaigns in Scotland, with a spirit equal to their
.orlmer fame. But their exploits were not considerable. Tle
Scots, soon becoming jealous of their designs, negle-ed to support
tlhem with proper vigour. The caution of the Englilh, in acing
wholly upon the dcfenfive, prevented the French from attempting
nny enterprise of coniequence; and obliged them to exhaust their
firclgth in tedious fiegcs, undertaken under Iany dilidvantages.
Their efforts, however, -were not without iOme benefit to the
Scots by compelling the Englith to evacuate I-Iaddingtoun, and to
surrender fevcral finall forts, which they possessed in different parts
of the kingdom.

Nations, which hold the fn-Rf rank in politencfs, are frequently no leis
tenacious out of pride. The Greeks were so in the ancient world;
and the French arc the fame in the modern. Full of thenilelvcs
flattered by the imitation of their ncighbours ; and accuflomed to
confider their own modes as the standards of elegance; they scorn
to difguifc, or to lay aiide, the diflinguifhing manners of their own
nation, or to make any allowance for what may diser from them
among others. For this rcafon, the behaviour of their armies
has, on every occalfon, been inflpportalle to ftraiigcrs, and has
always exposcd theml to hatred, and ofci'E to deflrucioon. In that
age, they over-ran Italy four several times by their valour, and lofr
it as often by their inibIlnc. The Scots, naturally an irascible
and hilh-fpiritcd people, and who, of all nations, can least beac
the mofi diiflant ilfinLuation of contempt, were not of a temper to
admit all the prctllnfions of iich afiTmin- g gutcs. T'he lc lptoms
of alienation wcie ioon vifibl)le; y econded tdecl military ope-
rations of the French troops with the utmofl coldness; their diilfuft
grew inifnfibly to a degree of indignation that could hardly be

with fatal violence. A private French soldier engaging in an idle
quarrel with a citizen of Edinburgh, both nations took arms, with
equal rage, in defence of their countrymen. The provost of
Edinburghl, his hl, anld fiveral citizens of diltilncion, were killed
in the fray ; and the French were obliged to avoid the fi:.ry of the
inhabitants, by retiring out of the city. Notwithfiandintg the

example reached Scotland, and the iappy cf'eclts of ccclefiaftical
liberty in tlle one nation, inqiuircd tlc other with an equal desire of
recovering it. The reformers hiad, hitherto, been obliged to con-
dut.c thenifelvcs with the utmost caution, and seldom ventured to
p!reach, but in private houses, and at a diflance from court; they
gaillned crclit, as happens on tlhe firi-f publication of every new
religion, chiefly among perlons in the lower and middle rank of
liif. IBut ibveral noblemen, of the grcatcfl' diftincsion, having,
about this time, openly efpouled their principles, they were no
longer under the ncceiity of aling with the tame r-cfrve; and
witlh more securi'ty and encoulragement, they iadl likewise greater

ing hiim, and of opening to herf'lf a way to ficcecd llini in that high-
di. Iity.. T-Ier l)rot'hcrs entered warmlly into tilis clilce, and
filp.ortlcid it with all thlii credit at the court of France. The
I.recnchl I. iing willingly concurred in a meaurc, by whliich hle hoped
to bring, Scotland entirely under managncment, and, in any future
broil witli England, to turn its whole force upon that kingdom.

IN order to arrive at tle dcfircd elevation, the cqueen dowager

hadc only one of tw1o ways to chinfc; eit:her violently to wrecf the
powcr out oftlle hands of the regent, or to obtain it by his con-I
Icnt. Uiidcr a minority, and among a lwarlike and faclious
people,i the former was a vcry uncertain and dangerous experi-
ilent. T'lie latter ap)Carld to be no lel's ilmplradcicable. To per-
tlicade a man volu ltiarilyv to abdicate the iuLpreme power; to dic-
Itccnd to a level with thole, above whom he was railed ; and to
lbe cointeni: with the second place where he hath hleld the firfl, may
well pats for a wild and chimierical projec. This, however, the
(lquen attemlptcd; and the lprudence of the attemcnt was iliicicntly
juLlfiicd by its fucccfs.

T-ru regent's inconflancy and irrcellution, together with the

calamities which had befallen the kingdom under his adminirlifa-
tion, raild tlhe prejudices both of the nobles and of the people
againfi him, to a great height; and the queen l ecrctly fomented

tlhele

tlhce with much induflry. All who willicd for a change mect with 1 °00 K
a gracious reception in her court, and their ipirit of clilaffclion ------
was nourifiled by ficli hopes and promises, as in every age iinpore
on the credulity of the factious. Tile favourers of thc Reformation Courts i,,
being the most numerous and ii'rcading body of the regcnt's cne-
mics, fhc applied to them with a particular attcntion and the
gentleness of her diflpohtion, anld ieemingi indifierence to the re-
ligious points in clilpute, made all her promises of protcLtioii and
indulgence pass upon them for fincerc. Finding to great a part
of the rtation willing to fall in with her mcaflires, tlhe queen lcet
out for France, under prctcnce of visiting her daughter, and took oa. 15o.
along with her thole noblemcn whio poltiflcdi the greatct I power and
credit among their countrymen. Softened by the plcatircs of an
clcgant court, flattered by the civilitics of the rcench king and the
carclies of the lioufe of Guiii, and influenced by tle fcalonablc
dillribution of a cfwv favours, and the liberal promiic of mnany
more, they were brought to approve of all the queen's prc-
tenlions.

VnrIIIr. flhe advanced by tlhcf flow but sure Rcps, the regent

cither did not foresee the danger wliicli threatened him, or nc-
gllccled to provide againfl it. The firll dicovery of the train which
was laid, came from two of his own1 confidents, Carncgie of Kin-
naird, and Panter biihop of Rols, whom the queen had gained
over to her intecrct, and then cmployed) as the imofl proper inliru-
mients for obtaining his conficnt. The overture was made to him
in the name of the French king, enforced by proper thrcatenings,
in order to work upon his natural timidity, and fwxeetened by
evcry proinife that could reconcile him to a proposal so dihfgrecable.
On the one hand, the confirmation of his French title, together
with a considerable pcenfion, tile parliamcntary acknowledglment

V'ol . 1. of

B O O 1K of his right of succession to the crown, and a public ratification of

his conduCt during his regency, were offered him. On the other
hand, the displeasure of the French king, the power and popularity
of the queen dowager, the difaffecion of the nobles, with the
danger of an after-reckoning, were repreicntcd in the firongefi
colours.

Ir was not poflible to agree to a pr-oposal so extraordinary and
lncxpe¢led, without some previous struggle; and had the arch-
bilhop of St. Andrew's been prefcnt to fortify the irresolute and
pafive spirit of the regent, he, in all probability, would have
r-ejcted it with didlain. Happily for the queen, the sagacity and
ambition of that prelate could, at this time, be no obftrudion to
her views. IIe was lying at the point of death, and in his absence
the influence of the queen's agents on a flexible temper counter-
balanced several of the firongef paflions in the human mind,,
and obtained his content to a voluntary surrender of the supreme

power.
Dec. 1551. AFTER gaining a point of such difliculty with so much ease,

the queen returned into Scotland, in full expectation of taking
immediate poffefion of her new dignity. But by this time the
archbishop of St. Andrew's had recovered of that diflemper, which
the ignorance of the Scottifli phyllcians had pronounced to be
incurable. This he owed to the afliftance of the famous Cardan,
one of those irregular adventurers in philosophy, of whom Italy
produced so many about this period. A bold genius led him to
some uleful discoveries, which merit the esteem of a more discern-
ing age; a wild imagination engaged him in those chimerical
sciences, which drew the admiration of his coterporaries. As a
pretender to astrology and magic, he was revered and consulted

5 by

by all Europe; as a proficient in natural philofopih, he vwas but 010 k
liiLle known. Thle archbishop, it is probable, conlficderci him as a ---^
1p)owerful magician, elicn lIe applied to him for relief; but it was his
knowledge as a pliilofolpher, which enabled himn to cure his difcafi '.

TOGETIIER Vwith his health, the archbiiihop recovered the entire

government of the regent, and (quickly pcri.U:cicd him to recal that
dishonourable promise, which he hadl been f'duced by the artifices
of the queen to grant. IIowever great her 1iilprilc and iindigna-
tion were, at this frefi inllance of hlis inconilancy, Iihe was obliged
to difllnblc, tliat fle mitght have leiilr to renew icr intrigues
with all parties; with tle protcPtants, 'lwhonl flic favoured and
courted more than ever; with the nobles, to wiomn flhe rendered
licriclf agreeable by various arts; and with the regent himself, ia
order to gain lwhom, fihe employed every argument. Bult what-
ever impreflions her emifaries night have miade on tile regent, it
was no easy matter to over-reach or to intimidate the arcihbifhiop.
Under ilis management, the negociations were spun out to a great
length, and his brother maintained his fLation with that address and
lirnncfs, vwhich its importance so well merited. The univerlal
decfccion of the nobility, the gcrowing powver of the protestants,
who all adhered to the queen dowager, the reiterated solicitations
of the French king, and, albove all, the interposition of the young
queen, who was now entering the twelfth year of her age, and
claimed a right of nominating whom fle plealted to be regent ', Preva.ils on

the rceent to
obliged him at lal: to rcfign that high- officc, which he had held rcfi^ is

oliice.

Cardan hinfelf was more desirous of being confidcred as an astrologer than a

pililofophlcr; in his book Do Ge'ituris, we find a calculation of the archbiflilp's
nativity, from which he pretends both to have prcdied( his disease, and to have
cfi-ceted his cure. IHe received from the archbifliop a reward of Igoo crowns:

Reformation VIIILE the queen dowager of Scotland contributed so much,
continues to
maake great towards the progress of the Reformation, by the protecaion whicl
progrcf. flhe afforded it, from motives of ambition ; the English queen,

by her indiscreet zeal, filled the kingdom with persons active in
July 6, 1553. promoting the fame cause. Mlary alcended the throne of Eng-

land on the death of her brother Edward, and soon after married
Philip II. of Spain. To the persecuting spirit of the Romish fu-
perflition, and the fiercencfs of that age, fle added the private re-
fentment of her own and of her mother's sufferings, with which
flie loaded the reformed religion ; and the peeviflnefs and severity
of her natural temper carried the acrimony of all there pafiions to
the utmo-f extreme. The cruelty of her persecution equalled the
deeds of those tyrants who have been the greateftl reproach to,
human nature. The bigotry of her clergy could scarce keep pace
witl the impetuosity of her zeal. Even the unrelenting Philip
was obliged, on some occasions, to mitigate the rigour of her
proceedings. Many among the mosl eminent reformers fufferedt

not abate the warmth and zeal of their indignation against popery.
Thlir attacks were bolder and more iLlccefssiiul than ever; and their
dlocdines made a rapid progrcfs among all ranks of men.

T'LIESI: do&rines, calculated to rcEify lhc opinions, and to

rclform the mannlers, of mankind, hlad hitllerto produced no other
ctifC:;; but tlhev oon began to operate with greater violence, and
proved the occasion, not only offlibverting the cftablifhed religion,
but of filaking the throne and lendangering tie kingdom. The A view of the

political

caules which facilitated tlhe introdu(tion of thece new opinions into caures which
Scotland, and which diflniinated them io fatl through the nation, towardLs tha.
llclit, on tlhat account, a particular and careful inquiry. The
Refbormation is one of the grcateft events in thec history of man-
kilnd, and, iln whatever point of liglit we view it, is infiruclive
and intcrcfling.

TiE revival of learning in the fifteenth and fixteenthl centuries

roiued the wvorldl from that lethargy in which it liad been Ifunk for
nmany ages. The human mind felt its own strength, broke the
fttters of authority by which it had been lo long rcifraincd, and
Clenturing to move in a larger fllhere, puflled its inquiries ilitc
cC)-ery tiibjec with great boldncis and flurprifing fucceis.

No tooncr did mankind recover tile capacity of exrcifing their

rcaton, than religion was one of the firfi oljeCts which drew thcir
:attcntion. I.ong before Lutler publificd his famous Theses

liichll fookc the papal throne, cicence and philosophy had laid.
oenl, to inaniy of the Italians, the impofliure and. absurdity of the

el-abliflled

B1 0 0 established superstition. That subtle and refined people, satisfied

»..-, _ with enjoying thole discoveries in secret, were little dilpofcd to

assume the dangerous charadcer of reformers, and concluded tile
knowledge of truth to be the prerogative of the wife, while vulgar
minds must be overawed and governed by popular errors. But,
animated with a more noble and dilintercfed zeal, the German
theologian boldly erected the fiandard of truth, and upheld it with
an unconquerable intrepidity, which merits the admiration and
gratitude of all succeeding ages.

TIiE occasion of Luther's being firfl disgusted with the tenets of

the Romish church, and howv, from a fnIall rupture, the quarrel
.widened into an irreparable breach, is know.rn to every one who
has been the least conversant in hiPfory. From the heart of Ger-
many his opinions spread, with altonilfing rapidity, all over
Europe; and, wherever they came, endangered or overturned the
ancient, but ill-founded system. The vigilance and address of the
court of Rome, co-operating with the power and bigotry of the
Aunfrian family, fupprefTed these notions on their firfl appearance,
in the ibuthern kingdoms of Europe. But the fierce spirit of the
north, irritatcd by multiplied inpofitions, could neither be mollified
by the fame arts, nor subdued by the fame force; and encouraged
by ibme princes fiomn piety, and by others out of avarice, it
cafily bore down the feeble opposition of an illiterate and immoral
clergy.

TIE fupelrfition of popery seems to have grown to the most

extravagant height in thoie countries which are situated towards
the different extremities of Europe. The vigour of imagination,
and sensibility of frame, peculiar to the inhabitants of ibuthern
climates, rendered them susceptible of the deepest impreflions of

filperilitious

fiiperifiticus tcrror and credulity. Ignorance and barbarity were B 0 0 I
no Icts favourable to the progress of thmesMe ifpirit among the ._.,
northern nations. They knew" little, and were dilfofc,1l to believe
evcrv thing. The nmolt glaring abfiudities cli not shock their
grols undcrtlandings, and the motl improbable fiicions wcre re-.
ccived with imllicit aic nt and admiiration.

ACCORDINGLY, tliat form of popery wlich prevailed in Scot-

land was of the nof bigolltted and illiberal kind. Thoce docrinhes
wh1ich arc moil apt to shlock the human ulndfleltand(ling, and tlhoe
legends which fiarthlc exceed belief, were proposed to tho people
wirhout any attempt to palliate or difguiif them; nor did they
ever call in queflion the rcafonablcnefs of the one, or the truth of
the other.

Tll;. power and wealth of the church Iept pace with the pro-

grels of il pcrfittion ; for it is the nature of that fiirit to olbfcrve
no bounds in its ref eE: and liberality towards tliore whoie cha-.
racir it eficems lacred. The Scottifl kings early demonrflratec
how muchl they were under its influence, by their vast: additions
to the immunities and riches cf the clergy. The profuse piety of
David I. who acquired on that account tile name of Saint, tranf-
fcrr-cd alinofi the whole crown lands, lwhich were at that time of
-;reat extcnt, into the hands of eccleiaftics. The example of
that virtuous prince was imitated by his successors. The spirit

rwread among all, orders of men, who daily loaded the pricfliood

with new pofeifionis. The riches of the church all over Europe
were exorbitant ; but Scotland was one of those countries, wherein
they ihad fartlhen: exceeded the just proportion. The Scottish
clergy paid one half of every tax imposed on land ; and as there
;s no realon to think that in that age they would be loadcd with

aai -\r

B 0 0 Ir any unequal share of the burden, we may conclude that, by the

_a- time of the Reformation, little less than one half of the property in

the nation had fallen into the hands of a society, which is always
acquiring, and can never lose.

THE nature, too, of a confilerable part of their property ex-

tended the influence of the clergy. Many estates, throughout the
kingdom, held of the church ; church-lands were let in lease at an
cafy rent, and were poffefied by the younger tbns and defeend-
ants of the best families '. The connelion between fi/pcrior and
vJcilz/, between landlord and tenant, created dependences, and
gave rife to an union of great advantage to the church; and in
cftimating the influence of the popifil ecclefaftics over the nation,
tliefe, as well as the real amount of their revenues, rnuft be at-
tended to, and taken into the account.

TISs extraordinary share in the national property was accom-

popish clergy arc remarkable, both as causes and effeas of that B oI° K
dominion which they had acquired over the reft of mankind.
They were regarded by the credulous laity as beings of a superior
fpecics; they were neither subject to the fame laws, nor tried by
the fame judges'. Every guard that religion could fipply, was
placed around their power, their possessions, and their persons;
and endeavours were used, not without fucceis, to rcprefent them
all as equally sacrcd.

TIrE reputation for Icarning, which, however inconsiderable,

was wholly cngrofied lby the clergy, added to the reverence which
they derived from religion. The principlcs of found philosophy,
and of a jflt taste, were altogether unknown ; in place of tlefe
lwerce fil)flitlutcd fludics barbarous and uninifrudtivc; but as the
ecclcriaftics alone were converfallt in them, this procured them
clteein; and a very flcnder portion of knowledge drew the admi-
ratiol of rutde agcs, which klnewv little. War was the sole pro-
fenlion of the nobles, and hlnting their chief amusement; they
divided their time betwecl thle le unacquainted with the arts, and
unimproved by icicnlce, they disdaincd any employment foreign
from military aftiirs, or xwhich -required rather penetration and
addrcfl , than bodily vi gour. \Vherever the former were neceflary,
the clergy were intruicd b; bccaule they alone were properly qua-
lified for the trufl. AlmloPi all the higlh offices in civil government'

How far this claim of the clergy to exemption fiom lay-jurifdiifion extended,

appears from a remarkable tranfalCtion in the parliament held in I546. When that
court was proceeding to the forfeiture of the murderers of cardinal Bcatoun, and
were about to include a priest, who w:s one of the afflifis, in the general sentence
of condemnation, odious as the crime was to ccclelfiatics, a delegate appeared in
their name, and r cir.hc'dl or claimtild c.xemption of himn from the judgment of par-

From the earliest ages of the monarchy, to the death of cardinal
Beatoun, fifty-four pcrfons had held that high office; and of
these, forty-three hlad been ecclefiaRicsY . The lords of iCflion
wvere supreme judges in all matters of civil right; and by its ori-
ginal conflitution, the president and one lhail of the senators in this
court were churchmen.

To all this we may add, that the clergy bein lfelparated from

.the refL of mankind by the law of celibacy, and undifiraced by
those cares, and unincunllercd with thofie burdens, which occupy
and oppreis other men, the intelell of their order became their
only olbjec, and they were at full lcifure to purife it.

TJIE nature of their funcllion gave tlnem access to all persons,

and at all leafons. They could employ all the inotives of fear
and of hope, of terror and of consolation, which operate mofr
powerfully on tlce human mind. They haunted tlie weak and
tlhe credulous; they besiegcd the beds of the lick and of the dying;
they flufflred few to go out of the wlorld without leaving marks
of their liberality to the church, and taught them to compound
with the Almighty for their fins, by befcowing riches upon those
who called themselves his servants.

barons should view the power and poflefions of the church with
envy; and regard the lazy ard inative charaser of churchmen
with the utmost contempt; while, at the fame time, the indecent
and licentious lives of the clergy gave great and just offence to the
people, and considerably abated the veneration which they were
accustomed to yield to that order of men.

IMMENSE wealth, extreme indolence, gross ignorance, and,

above all, the severe injunction of celibacy, had concurred to in-
troduce this corruption of morals among many of the clergy, who,
presuming too much upon the submission of the people, were at
no pains either to conceal or to disguise their own vices. Accord-
ing to the accounts of the reformers, confirmed by several popish
wrriters, the most open and scandalous difiolution of manners pre-
vailed among the Scottill clergy " Cardinal Beatoun, with the
fame public pomp which is due to a legitimate child, celebrated
the marringe of his natural daughter with tle earl of Crawfurd's

' A remarkable proof of the dissolute manners of the clergy is found in the public

records. A greater number of letters of legitimation was granted during the first
thirty years after the Reformation, than during the whole period that has elapsed
since that time. Thefc were obtained by the sons of the popifli clergy. The cccle-
fiaftics, who were allowed to retain their benefices, alienated them to their children;

ecclcfiaftics, cither out of pride or ignorance, neglected the proper

ation, than the authority of the church and the decrees of

they infife(l in their difcouries to the people; and the duty of
preaching being left wholly to monks of the lowest and most illi-

conceived the queen to have offered an intilt both to their un-

so much dignity; to the latter, by imagining that they were
tame enough not to complain of an affront, which, in no former
age, would lhave been tolerated witli imlpunity.

\rWHILE their minds Rwere in this dlifpofition, an incident hap-

pened which inflamed their aversion fiom French councils to
the highef: degree. Ever since the famous contest between the
houses of Valois and Plantagenct, the French had been accuflomed
to embarrass the English, and to divide their strength by the fud-
den and formidable incursions of their allies, the Scots. But, as
these inroads were seldom attended with any real advantage to
Scotland, and cxpofed it to the dangerous resentment of a power-
ful neighbour, the Scots began to grow less traclable than for-
merly, and scrupled any longer to serve an ambitious ally at the
price of their own quiet and security. Tlhe change, too, which
was daily introducing in the art of war, rendered the affiflance of
the Scottifi forces of less importance to the French monarch. For
these rea:tons, Henry having resolved upon a war with Philip I.
and forefecing that the queen of England would take part in her
husband's quarrel, was extremely solicitous to secure in Scotland
the afiflance of tome troops, which would be mrore at his command
than an unditfiplined army, led by chieftains who were almost
independent. In prosecution of this design, but under prctence

of relieving the nobles from the cxpence and danger of defending 00 K
the borders, the queen regent proposed, in parliament, to regiftcr .---..-
the value of lands throughout the kingdom, to impoie on them a 55
finall tax, and to apply that revenue towards maintaining a body
of regular troops in conrfant pay. A fixed tax upon land, which
the growing expence of government hath introduced into alinofl
every part of Europe, was unknown at that time, and teemed
altogether inconfiPfent with the genius of feudal government.
Nothing could be more flocking to a generous and brave nobility,
than the intrusting to mercenary hands, the defence of those ter-
ritories which had been acquired, or preserved, by the blood of
their ancestors. They received this proposal with the utmost: dif-
fatisfacion. About three hundred of the leier barons repaired in
a body to the queen regent, and represented tleir sense of the
intended innovation, with that manly and determined boldness
which is natural to a free people in a martial age. Alarmed at a
remonstrance delivered in so firm a tone, and supported by such
formidable numbers, the queen prudently abandoned a scheme,
which flhe found to be universally odious. As the queen herself
was known perfecly to underfland the circuinfances and temper
of the nation, this mcafure was imputed wholly to the suggestions
of her foreign counsellors; and the Scots were ready to proceed
to the most violent extremities againfl them.

and attempted to excite them to invade England. But, as Scot-
land had nothing to dread from a princess of Mary's charaaer-,

fubjeEts; the nobles, who were affelnbled by the queen regents
at Newbattle, listened to the solicitations of the French monarch
with extreme coldness, and prudently declined engaging the king-
domn in an enterprise so dangerous and unneceflary. What ihe
could not obtain by persuasion, tlh queen regent brought about by
:a flratagein. Notwithfltanding the peace which fubfiPed between
the two kingdoms, she commanded her French soldiers to rebuild
a finall fort near Bcrwick, which was appointed, by the last treaty,.
to be rafed. The garrison of Berwick sallied out; interrupted the
vwork ; and ravaged the adjacent country. This insult roused the
fiery spirit of the Scots, and their promptness to revenge the leaP,
appearance of national injury, diflipated, in a moment, the wife
and pacific resolutions which they had so lately formed. XWar
was determined, and orders inPfantly given for raising a numerous
army. But before their forces could assemble, the ardour of their
indignation had time to cool, and the Englifli having discovered no
intention to pufl the war with vigour, the nobles resumed their
pacific fyflem, and rcfolved to stand altogether upon the defensive.
1556. They marched to the banks of the Tweed, they prevented the

incursions of the enemy; and hallving done what they thought
tuflicient for the fafcty and honour of their country, the queen
could not induce them, cither by her entreaties or her artifices, to
advance another ftcp.

'WIIILE the Scots persisted in their inativity, D'Oyfel, the

commander of the French troops, who poffefled entirely the conli-
dence of the queen regent, endeavoured, with her connivance, to
engage the two nations in hostilities. Contrary to the orders
of the Scottifi general, he marched over the Tweed with his own

soldiers,

Scots, inflead of seconding his attempt, werc enraged at hiss prc-
fumption. The queen's partiality towards France had long been
fufhlpecd ; but it was now vibl)le that fhc wantonly sacrificcd the
peace and tffcty of Scotland, to the intcrcf: of that ambitious and
aflfuming ally. Under the feudal governlments, it was in camps
that fubjcE-s were accustomed to address the boldest ricionftranccs
to their sovereigns. While arms were in their hands, they felt
their own strength; and at that time all their reprefcntations olf
grievances carried the authority of comm-ands. On this occasion,
the resentment of the nobles broke out with such violence, that
the queen, pcrceiving all attempts to engage them in acion to be
vain, abruptly difiniflced her army, and retired with the utmost:
shame and disgust; having difcovcred the impotence of her own
authority, without effec.ing any thing which could be of advantage
to France ::o

IT is observable, that this first inl-ance of contempt for the re-

gent's authority can, in no degree, be imputed to the influence of
the new opinions in religion. As the queen's prctenfions to the
regency had been principally fulpported by those who favoured the
Reformation, and as fllc fill needed them for a countirpoife to the
archbishop of St. Andrew's, and the partilans of the houcf of

-Hamilton; sic continued to treat them with great rcipcd, and
admitted them to no inconsiderable fliare in her favour and con-
lidence. Kirkaldy of Grange, and the other surviving conspirators
against cardinal Bcatoun, were, alout this time, recalled by her
from baniflment; and, through her connivance, the priotefta,.t
preachers clnjoyed an interval of tranquillity, which was of great
advantage to their cause. Soothed by these inflanccs of the quecn.',

the bloom ¢f youth, and considerable as the territories were, which
she wvould hrve added to the French monarchy; reasons were not
wanting to difiuade HIenry from completing his first plan of marry-
ing her to his son. The constable Montmorency had employed
all his interest to defeat an alliance which refleced so much lustre
on the princes of Lorrain. He had represented the impossibility
of maintaining order and tranquillity among a turbulent people,
during the absence of their sovereign; and for that reason had
advised I-lenry to bestow the young queen upon one of the princes
of the blood, who, by residing in Scotland, might preserve that
kingdom an useful ally to France, which, by a nearer union to
the crown, would become a mutinous and ungovernable province''
But at this time the conflable was a prisoner in the hands of the
Spaniards; the princes of Lorrain were at the height of their power;
and their influence, seconded by the charms of the young queen,
triumphed over the prudent, but envious, remonstrances of their
rival.

L.,_ -- , into Scotland, this accident was universally imputed to the effects

of poison, which was supposed to have been given them by the
emifl'ries of the house of Guise. The historians of all nations
discover an amazing credulity with refped to rumours of this kind,
which arc so well calculated to please the malignity of some men,
and to gratify the love of the marvellous which is natural to all,
that in every age they have been 1iPallowed without examination,
and believed contrary to reason. No wonder the Scots should
easily give credit to a suspicion, which received such firong co-
lours of probability, both fiom their own resentment, and from
the known charadcer of the princes of Lorrain, so little scrupulous
about the juflice of the ends which they pursued, or of the means
which they employed. For the honour of human nature it
mufft, lhowever, be observed, that as we can discover no motive
which could induce any man to perpetrate such a crime, so there
appears no evidence to prove that it was committed. But the
Scots of that age, influenced by national animofities and prejudices,
were incapable of examining the circumstances of the cafe with
calmness, or of judging concerning them with candour. All
parties agreed in believing the French to have been guilty of this
detefrable aclion; and it is obvious how much this tended to
increase tle aversion for them, which was growing among all
ranks of men.

' --"-~- opinions, and of exercising that worship, which so great a part of

the nation deemed to be founded in truth, and to be acceptable to
the Deity. This indulgence, to which the whole weight of
prieflly authority was opposed, there were only two ways of ob-
taining. Either violence must extort it from the relutant hand
of their sovereign, or by prudent compliances they might expecl it
from her favour or her gratitude. The former is an expedient
for the redress of grievances, to which no nation has recourse fid-
denly; and fuilje&s seldom venture upon refitance, which is their
laIc remedy, but in cafes of extreme necessity. On this occasion
the Reformers wifely held the opposite course, and by their zeal
in forwarding the queen's designs, they hoped to merit her pro-
tecion. This disposition the queen encouraged to the utmost,
and amused them so artfully with many promises, and some con-
ceflions, that, by their aflfilance, she surmounted in parliament
the force of a national and laudable jealousy, which would other-
vwife have swayed with the greater number.

ANOTHER circumstance contributed somewhat to acquire the

regent such considerable influence in this parliament. In Scotland,
all the bishoprics, and those abbeys which conferred a title to a feat
in parliament, were in the gift of the Crown '. From the time
of her accession to the regency, the queen had kept in her own
hands almost all those which became vacant, except such as were,
to the great disgust of the nation, betlowed upon foreigners.
Among these, her brother the cardinal of Lorrain had obtained
the abbeys of Kelfo and Melrofs, two of the molt wealthy found-
ations in the kingdom ". By this conduct, she thinned the ec-

Tii:i earl of Argyll, and James Stcwart prior of St. Andrew's,

one the most powerful, and the other the mofil popular leader

law in England. The acceflion of a queen, who, under very dif-
ficult circumstances, had given strong indications of those eminent
qualities, which, in the sequel, rendered her reign so illustrious,
attracted the eyes of all lurope. Among the Scots, both parties
obcerved her first motions with the utmost solicitude, as they easily
foresaw that fle would not remain long an indifferent fpedator of
their tranl-actions.

w.-hoe mofl indcfttigable zeal could not latisfy the avidity of thofc
who deftred their inrhruclions. Among a people bred to arms,
and as prompt as the Scots to aci with violence; and in an age
when religious paflions had taken such firong pofioofficn of the
hulmall mind, and moved and agitated it with so much violence,
the peaceable and regular demeanor of tb numerous a party is

tyranny, they did, in no instance, tranfgrcfs those bounds of duty

their own leaders, and the protection which the queen regent,
from political motives, afforded them, the moderation of the arch-
bishop of St. Andrew's encouraged this pacific disposition. That
prelate, whoLe private life cotemporary writers tax with great irre-

B 0 IK attended every proposal for reformation, addrcffed to that order of
.. men. To abandon usurped power, to renounce lucrative error,

are sacrifices, which the virtue of individuals has, on tome oc-
cafions, offered to truth; but from any society of men no ilchl
effort can be expecRed. The corruptions of a society, recom-
mended by common utility, and juflified by universal practice,
are viewed by its members without shame or horror; and reform-
ation never proceeds from themselves, but is always forced upon
them by some foreign hand. Suitable to this unfeeling and in-
flexible spirit was the behaviour of the convocation in the present
conjuncture. All the demands of the protestants were rejeted with
contempt; and the popifib clergy, far from endeavouring, by any
prudent conceflions, to sooth and to reconcile such a numerous
body, asSertcd the doctrines of their church, concerning some
of the most exceptionable articles, witll an ill-timed rigour, which
gave new offence '.

gan to ifpect tfome change in the regent's disposition towards
them. Though joined with them for many years by interest, and
united, as they conceived, by the strongest ties of affection and of
gratitude, fle discovered, on this occasion, evident symptoms, not
only of coldneis, but of a growing disgust and aversion. In order
to account for this, our hiflorians do little more than produce the
trite observations concerning the influence of prosperity to alter
the character and to corrupt the heart. The queen, fay they,
having reached the utmost point to which her ambition aspired, no
longer preserved her accustomed moderation, but, with an info-
lence usual to the fortunate, looked down upon those by whose

in the depravity of the human heart, nor in the ingratitude of the

prcfcnt condut. These were derived fiom another, and a more
remote fourcc, which, in order to clear the fubfcquent tranfaaions,
wve shall endeavour to open with some care.

TH-E ambition of the princes of Lorrain had been no less sic- Ambitiou,

iews of the

cefsful than daring; but all their fchcllls were diflinguiflcd by princes of
being v;ft and unbounded. Though i-rangers at the court of Lorain.
France, their cminent qualities had raised them, in a fiort time,
to an height of power, superior to that of all other iubjccs, and had
placed themn on a level even with the princes of the blood them-
selves. The church, the army, the revenue, were under their
diretion. Nothing but the royal dignity remained unattained,
and they were elevated to a near alliance with it, by the marriage
of the queen of Scots to the dauphin. In order to gratify their
own vanity, and to render their niece more worthy the heir of
France, they set on foot her claim to the crown of England, which
was founded on prctences not unplaufiblc.

T-IE tragical amours and marriages of Henry VIII. are known

to all the world. Moved by the caprices of his love, or of his
refentmcnt, that impatient and arbitrary monarch had divorced
or behiadcd four of the fix queens whom he married. In order
to gratify him, both his daughters had been declared illegitimate
by aSI of parliament; and yet, with that fantastic inconfiflence
which diRinguiincs his charater, he, in his lafi will, whereby he
was empowered to fettle the order of succession, called both of
them to the throne upon the death of their brother Edward; and,
at the fame time, pafling by the posterity of his eldest filter Mar-

IN confcquencc of thllis defination, the vlidity whereof was

admitted by the English, but never recognized by foreigners,
iMary had irigned in Enlland without the leaf complaint of
neighbouring princes. But the fame causes which facilitatcd her
accejcion to the throne, were obstacles to the elevation of her sifter
Eliz-iabcth, and rendered her poficseion of it precarious and infe--
cure. Rome trembled for the catholic faih, under a proteflant
queen of fuich eminent abilities. The fame ulperficitious fears
alarmed the court of Spain. France beheld with concern a throne,
to whlich the queen of Scots could form so many pretcnfions,
occup)ied by a rival, hitoe birth, i the opion f all good catholis,
excluded her from any legal right of succession. The impotent
hatred of the Roman pontiff, or the flow councils of Philip II.

on all occasions. No preparations, however, were made to ilup-
port this impolitic and premature claim. Elizabeth was already

the only method for flupprefling religious opinions known in that
age, or dictated by the delpotic and 11tng-liinary i)irit of the
Romnifl fiiperftition, this, in its utmofi violence, they determined
to employ. The earl of Argyll, tle prior of St. Andrew's, and
other leaders of the party, were marked out by them for imme-
diate deftrution d; and they hoped, by puniflling them, to inti-
midate their followers. Inftrudions for this purpoif2 were sent
from France to the queen regent. That humane and sagacious
princess condemned a incafure which was equally violent and
impolitic. By long residence in Scotland, she had become ac-
quainted with the eager and impatient temper of the nation; fiie

then could be gained by routing this dangerous spirit, which
hitherto all the arts of policy had fcarccly been able to restrain ? If
it once broke loose, the authority of a regent would be little ca-
pable to fubduc, or even to moderate, its rage. If, in order to
quell it, foreign forces were called in, this would give the alarm
to the whole nation, irritated already at tlle excefivc power which

inflexible in all their rclolutions, they infitcld on the full and

the intcircil of lrance, and ready, on all occalions, to sacrifice her

Summons Tr-HE indignation which betrayed the queen into this rafl cx-
their prcach-
crs 5to appear prcflion, was nothing in comparison of that with which she was

borc h. animated, upon hearing that the public exercise of the reformed

religion had been introduced into the town of Perth. At once
she threw off the mafkl, and iflued a mandate, summoning all
the protcftant preachers in the kingdom to a court of justice, which
was to be held at Stirling on the tenth of May. The protestants,
who, fron their union, began about this time to be diftinguifled
by the name of the CONGREGATION, ,were alarmed, but not
intimidatcd by this danger; and instantly rcfolved not to abandon
the men to whom they were indebted for the inoft valuable of
all bleflings, the knowledge of truth. At that time there prevailed
in Scotland, with rcfpe- to criminal trials, a cuftorm, introduced
at firil by the inllitutions of vafalage and clanfllip, and tolerated
afterwards under a feeble government; pcrfons accused of any
crime were accompanied to the place of trial by a retinue of their
fiiends and adherents, aflcmbled for that purpose from every quarter
of the kingdom. Authorised by this ancient pratice, the reformed
convened in great numbers, to attend their pallors to Stirling.
The queen dreaded their approach with a train so numerous, though
unarmed; and in order to prevent them from advancing, she
cmpovered John Erskine of Dun, a person of eminent authority
with the party, to promise in her name, that flhe would put a
flop to the intended trial, on condition the preachers and their
retinue advanced no nearer to Stirling. Erskine, being convinced
himself of the queen's sincerity, served her with the utmost zeal;
and the protestants, averse fiomn proceeding to any ad of violence,
Jiftened with pleasure to so pacific a proposition. The preachers,

with

with a few lcaders of the party, remained at Perth ; the multi- i.0
tudce wlhich had gathcrecl from diflrrcntt parts of the kingdomll ..

cge t". be the refu lt of no groundless or uniiccefl-lry fear. No fooncr were

the protcflant forces difinifcd, than file broke every article in the
treaty. She introduced Ircnch troops into Perth, fined onic of
the inhabitants, banishnd others, rem.oved the magiflrates out of
office, and, on her retiring to Stirling, she left behind her a gar-
rifon of fix hundred men, with orders to allow the exercise of no
other religion than the Roman catholic. The situation of Perth,
a place at that time of foine st-rength, and a town among the molt
proper of any in the kingdom for the station of a garrison, seems
·to have allured the queen to this unjutifiable and ill-judged breach
of public faith; which she endeavoured to colour, by alleging that
the body of men left at Perth was entirely composed of native Scots,
though kept in pay by the king of France.

ThnE queen's scheme began gradually to unfold; it was now

apparent, that not only the religion, but the liberties of the king-
dom were threatened ; and that the French troops were to be em-
ployed as inflrumcnts for subduing the Scots, and wreathing the
yoke about their necks. Martial as the genius of the Scots then
was, the poverty of their country made it inpoifible to keep their

armies

armies long aflembled; and even a very frnall body of rcgular E 00 K
troops might have proved formidable to the nation, though con- I .- -j
filling wholly of soldiers. But what number of French forces 5j9'
were then in Scotland, at what times, and under what pretext
they returned, after having left the kingdom in one thousand live
lhmndred and fifty, we cannot with any certainty determine.
Contemporary hifiorians often ielea with little judgment the
circumftanccs which they tranfinit to posterity; and with relfpel
to matters of the greatefn curiosfty and importance, leave succeed-
ing ages altogether in the dark. \Vre may conjecture however,
from fomc pafllgcs in Buchanan, that the French and Scots in
Frcnch pay amounted at lcafn to three thousand men, under the
command of Moniteur D'Oyfcl, a creature of the house of Guifc;
and they were soon augmented to a much morc formidable
1numlber.

TuE queen, encouraged by having so considerable a body of

wcll-difciplined troops at her command, and infligated by the
:-iolcnt counsels of D'Oyfcl, had ventured, as we have observed,
to -iolate the treaty of Perth, and, by that rafl ation, once more
threw the nation into tlhe most dangerous convulsions. The earl The pro:crf

of Argyll and prior of St. Andrew's inflantly deserted a court, take arNs.
where faith and honour seemed to them to be no longer regarded;
and joined the leaders of the Congregation, who had retreated to
the eaflern part of Fife. The barons from the neighbouring
countics rcpaired to them, the preachers roused the people to arms,
aind wherever they came, the fame violent operations which acci-
dent had occasioned at Perth, were now encouraged out of policy.
The enraged multitude was let loose, and churches and mona-
ftcries, the monuments of ccclefiaftic -pride and luxury, were
lacrificed to their zeal.

m--- ent, put her troops in motion; but the zeal of the Congrc-
I;59' gation got the flart once more of her vigilance and aativity. In

that warlike age, when all men were accuflomed to arms, and on
the leafl profpc of danger were ready to run to them, the leader;
of the protestants found no difficulty to raise an army. Though
they set cut from St. Andrew's with a slender train of an hundred
horse, crowds flocked to their standards from every corner of the
country through which they marched; and before.they reached
Falkland, a -village only ten miles distant, they were able to meet
the queen with superior force'..

THE queen, surprised at the approach of so formidable a bod)y,

which was drawn up by its leaders in such a manner as added
greatly in appearance to its numbers, had again recourse to nego-
ciation. She found, however, that the preservation of the pro-
teftant religion, their zeal for which had at first roused the leaders
of the Congregation to take arms, was not the only object they had
now in view. They were animated with the warmest love of
civil liberty, which they conceived to be in imminent danger from
the attempts of the French forces; and these two patfons min-

Theyamig at gling, added reciprocally to each other's ftrcngth. Together with
vil as c:l as more enlarged notions in religion, the Reformation filled the
reigiious
griev.irCs, human mind with more liberal and generous sentiments concern-

ing civil government. The genius of popery is extremely favour-
able to the power of princes. The implicit fubmiflion to all her

companied them in othcr I:ienccs, and diicovcred every-where the d-le
Ilme manly zeal for truth. A ncew itudy, introduced at the fame
time, added greater force to the spirit of liberty. Men became
more acquainted with the G(reek and Rooman authors, who deiribed
exquiiite models of free governmenlt, far superior to the inaccurate
and oppressive system eflabliilced by tlte feudal law; and produced
filch illustrious examples of public virtue, as wonderfully suited
both the circumstances and spirit of tlat age. Many amo!ng the
nmof eminent reformers were thcifelves considerable mnailers in
,ancient learning; and all of them eagerly adopted the maxims
and spirit of the ancients, with regard to government . The
most ardent love of liberty accompanied the proteflant religion
throughout all its progress ; and wherever it was embraced, it
routed an independent spirit, which rendered men attentive to
their privileges as fubjecs, and jealous of the encroachments of
their sovereigns. IKnox, and the other preachers of the Reform-
ation, infiued generous sentiments concerning government into
the minds of their hearers ; and the Scottinl barons, naturally free
and bold, were prompted to afcert their rights with more freedom
and boldncfs than ever. Inftcad of obeying the queen regent,
who had enjoined thenm to lay down their arms, they demanded

conccffion without the concurrence of the French monarch ; and
as tome time was requisite in order to obtain that, she hoped,
during this interval, to receive such reinforcements from France,
as would insure the accompliflhment of tlat dclign which she had
June 13. twice attempted with unequal strength. Meanwhile, she agreed

to a ceiattion of arms for eight days, and before the expiration
of these, engaged to transport the French troops to the south fide
of the Forth ; and to fend commiflioners to St. Andrew's, who
should labour to bring all differences to an accommodation.
As ic hoped, by means of the French troops, to overawe the
proteflants in the southern counties, the former article in the

merely to amuse the Congregation, was no longer remembered.

ing flbjceted to the iniblencc and exaaions of the garrison which
the quecn hadI left there, implored the aliflance of the Congre-

former trcaty, they prepared to besiege it in form. The queen
employed the earl of Huntly and lord Erskine to divert them from
this enterprifi. But her wonted artifices were now of no avail;

AFTER the lols of Perth, the queen endeavoured to seize Stir-

nearly resembling those pagan originals whence it had been copied.

did their leaders labour to refIrain this impetuous spirit of reform-
ation. Irregular and violent as its sallies were, they tended direcly
to that end which they had in view; for, by demolitliing the
monasteries throughout the kingdom, and setting at liberty their
wretched inhabitants, they hoped to render it impossible ever to
rebuild the one, or to r-e-assemble the other.

BUT amidst these irregular proceedings, a circumstance which

does honour to the conduct and humanity of the leaders of the
Congregation deserves notice. They so far restrained the rage of
their followers, and were able so to temper their heat and zeal,
that few of the Roman catholics were exposed to any personal
insult, and not a single man suffered death '

Ar the fame time we discover, by the facility with which these B 0 0 K

great rcvoliUtions were cffeled, how violcntly the current of _-.-
national favour ran towards the Reformation. No more than 559'
three hundred men marched out of Perth under the earl of
Argyll and prior of St. Alndrew's m; with this inconsiderable force
they advanced. But wherever they came, the people joined them
in a 1)odY!; their army was fcldom less numerous than five thou-
sand men; the gates of every town were thrown open to receive
them; and, without striking a single blow, they took pofieflion June 29
of the capital of the kingdom.

T7I1s rapid and astonishing success seems to have encouraged the

reformers to extend their views, and to rife in their demands.
Not fatislicd with their irit. claim of toleration for their religion,
they now openly aimed at cftablihling the protestant docrine on
the ruins of popery. For this reaion they determined to tix their
rclidcnce at Edinburgh; and by their appointment Knox, and
some other preachers, taking- poffellion of thle pulpits, which Iiad
been abandoned by the afirightened clergy, declaimed against the
errors of popery with ficlh fervent zeal as could not fail of gaining
many profcly tes.

IN the mean time the queen, who had prudently given way to

a torrent which flie could not rcfiR', obfcrved with pleasure that it
now began to fubfidc. The leaders of the Congregation had been.
above two months in arms, and by the expences of a campaign

i-. As intelligence is procured in civil wars with little difliculty, what-

ever was tranlated at Edinburgh was soon known at Dunlbar.
The queen, regulating her own conducl by the fituationl of her
advcrlaries, artfully amulcd thenm with the profipec of an immlediate
accommodation ; while, at the fame timle, Che by fiudicd delays
(pun out.the negociations for that purpose to fuchl a length, that,
in the end, the party dwindled to an inconsiderable number; and,
as if peace had been already re-cflablifhed, became careless of mili-
tary difeipline. The queen, ,who watched for such an opportunity,
advanced unexpcctedly, by a sudden march in the night with all
her forces, and appearing before Edinburgh, filled that city with
the utmost conflernation. The proteflants, weakened by the in-
prudent difierfion of their followers, durst not encounter the
French troops in the open field ; and were even unable to defend
an ill-fortified town against their assaults. Unwilling, however;
to abandon the citizens to the queen's mercy, they endeavoured,
by facing the enemy's army, to gain time for colleccing their oiwn
asSociates. But the queen, in spite of all their refiflance, would
have easily forced her way into the town, if the seasonable con-
clufion of a truce had not procured her adminFion without the
effusion of blood.
A third trei- TH-EIR dangerous situation easily induced the leaders of the Con-

ty. gregation to lifnen to any overtures of peace.; and as the queen

was looking daily for the arrival of a strong reinforcement from
France, and expected great advantages from a cefllation of arms,
flhe also agreed to it upon no unequal conditions. Together with
a suspension of hostilities, from the twenty-fourth of July to the
tenth of January, it was ilipulated in this treaty, that, on tlhe

0110

one hand, the proteflants flould open the gates of Edinburgh next 13 °0 TX
morning to the queen regent; remain in duLtifill fubjeCion to her ---
government; abflain from all future violation of religious lioufes;
and give no interruption to the eftabliihcd clergy, either in the
dilcharge of their fuincions, or in the enjoyment of their benefices.
On tlic other hland, the queen agreed to give no molestation to
the preachers or profcfbors of the protrefant rcligion ; to allow the
citizens of Edinburgh, during the cclation of hollilities, to enjoy
the exercise of religious worllip according to the form most agree-
able to the confcicncc of each individual; and to permit the free
and public profeflion of the protcflant faith in every part of the
kinlcldoin". The queen, by these liberal conceflions in behalf of
their religion, hoped to sooth the proteflants, and expected, from
indulging their favourite paflion, to render them more compliant
with refcp&c to other articles, particularly the expulsion of the
French troops out of Scotland. The anxiety which the queen
exprefcid for retaining this body of men, rendered them more and
more the objects of national jealousy and aversion. The imme-
diate expulsion of them was therefore demanded anew, and with
greater warmh l; but the queen, taking advantage of the diflrefs
of the advcrfi party, eluded the request, and would content to
nothing more, than that a French garrilon should not be intro-
duced into Edinbur.l i.

THiE dcftpcratc sPate of their anrairs imposed on the Congregation

_L-.--. A small body of those troops, maintained in constant pay, and

of a martial people, though animated with zeal both for religiod
and liberty. The finalleft addition to their number, and a con-
fiderable one was daily cxpeEled, might prove fatal to public
liberty, and Scotland might be exposcd to thec danger of being re-
duced from an independent kingdom, to the mean condition of a
province, annexed to the dominions of its powerful ally.

IN order to provide against this inminent calamity, the duke of

Chatelherault, and earl of I-Iuntly, immediately after concluding
the truce, desired an interview with the chiefs of the Congregation.
These two noblemen, the most potent at that time in Scotland,
were the leaders of the party which adhered to the eflablifhed
church. They had followed tlhe queen, during the late commo-
tions, and having access to observe more narrowly the dangerous
tendency of her councils, their abhorrence of the yoke which was
preparing for their country surmounted all other considerations,
and determined them rather to endanger the religion which they
professed, than to give their aid towards the execution of her per-
nicious designs. They proceeded farther, and promiscd to Argyll,
Glencairn, and the prior of St. Andrew's, who were appointed to
meet them, that if the queen should, with her usual inlinccrity,
violate any article in the treaty of truce, or refute to gratify the
wilhes of the whole nation, by difmnifing her French troops, they
would then inflantly join with their countrymen in compelling her
to a measure, which the public faifety, and the preservation of
their liberties, rendered necessary °.

that alccndant over the spirit of his mafler, vwhlich his great expe-

Accession of TIIE tragical and untimely death of the French monarch put

to the crown an end to all moderate and pacific measures with regard to Scot-

the acceflion of Francis II. a prince void of genius and without
experience, assumed the chief diretion of French affairs. Allied
lo nearly to the throne, by the marriage of their niece the queen
of Scots with the young king, they now wanted but little of regal
dignity, and nothing of regal power. This power did not long
remain inaaive in their hands. The fame vafl: fiemes of am-
bition, which they had planned out under the former reign, were
again resumed; and they were enabled, by poflefing such ample
authority, to pursue them with more vigour and greater proba-
bility of success. They beheld, with infinite regret, the progress
of the proteflant religion in Scotland; and, sensible what an un-
surmountable obstacle it would prove to their designs, they bent
all their strength to check its growth, before it rose to any greater
height. Ior this purpose they carried on their preparations with
all poffllble expedition, and encouraged the queen their sifter to
cxpc:t, in a short time, the arrival of an army so powerful as

NoR were the lords of the Congregation cither ignorant of tlicAC

violent couniels, which prevaiicl in the court o' I'ralnce lince the
death of I-Ienry, or carclefs of providing againfi the danger which
tlhreatened then fiom that quarter. The ifccclS of their caulc,
as well as their personal ahfer),, dependiling entirly on the utna-
nimity and vigour of their own relollutions, tlhey cdcavouled to
guard against division, and to cement together more clolily, by
entering into a ftri-cer bond of col'nfedracy and mnutual ldeence.
Two persons concurred in this new allbciation, who brought a
great acceflion both of reputation and of power to the party.
Thcfe were the duke of Chatellirault, and his clelcll oii the earl
of Arran. This young nobleman, having refielcd tome years in
irance, where lie commanded the Scottilli guards, had imbibct
the protcflant opinions concerning religion. Iu/rried along by
tlhe heat of youth and the zeal of a proilyte, he had uttered
sentiments with rcip eC: to the points in controversy, which did
not suit the temper of a bigottcd court, intent at tlnt jllunture
on the extinction of the protestant religioln; in order to accoinplilh
which, the grcatcfl ccceflcs of violence wcre committed. The
church was suffercd to wreak its utmost fury upon all who -were
fuLfptcaed of hcrefly. Courts were erelctd in diiTr-cnt parts of
France, to take cognizance of this crime, and by tlcir fentcnces
several persons of diflincion were condemned to the i]alics.

BUT, in order to inspire more univcrfal terror, the princes cf

Lorrain resolved to felc&, for a sacrifice, some perifn whose iaM
might convince all ranks of men, that neither fplcndour of birth,
nor eminence in rfation, could exempt from punifhmcnt those who

flould

B 0o o; K fould be guilty of this unpardonable tranfgrcflion. The earl of
.;-----~- Arran was the person destined to be the unhappy vi&in r. As

1s'9' he was allied to one throne, and the presumptive heir to another;

as he ponelffed the firCl rank in his own country, and enjoyed an
honourable flation in France; his condemnation could not fail of
making the desired impression on the twhole kingdom. But the
cardinal of Lorrain having let fall some expreflions, which raifedl
Arran's fuNflicions of tile design, he escaped the intended blow by
a timely flight. Indignation, zeal, refentmenr, all prompted hin
to seek revenge upon tlhee persecutors of himself and of the
religion whxich lhe profeflcd ; and as he pafIed through England,
on llis return to his native country, Elizabeth by hopes and pro-
miles inflaimed those paflions, and sent him back into Scotland,
animated xvith tihe anme implacable aversion to France, vhlih polf

.:itl of Ar- ICfced a great part of his countrymen. IIe quickly communicated
ranjo'ns the
prot:ctaL;s. theftc iUntimcnts to his father the duke of Chatelhcrault, who was

already extremely dilgullled with the measures carrying on in
Scotland; and as it was the fate of that nobleman to be governed
in every infitance by those about him, he now fulered himself to be
drawn from the queen regent; ancd, having joined the Congrega-
tion, was confidered, from that time, as the head of the party.

BUT mwith refpccL to him, this diftin[ion was merely nominal.
iames Stewart, prior of St. Andrew's, was the person who moved
and acluated the whole body of the protestants, among whom he
pofrcflucd that unbounded confidence, which his fircnuous adherence
to their interert and his great abilities lb jufily merited. I-e was
the natural son of James V. by a daughter of lord i rfline; and
as that amorous monarch had left ieveral others a burden upon

tlhe crown, they were all dcflinced for the church, where thecy 1 °' 0 Ki
could be placed in flations of dignityr and alliunc. In co lC- ----
quence of this rcfolution, the priory of St. Andrew's h1:d bee'.
conferred upon James: but, during 1) bhufy a period, lie iboo
became clifgurfed with the indolence and 'rtirl'cicnt olf a motaflic
life; and his cntcrplrifing genius called hill forlh, tO ad a prinlcipal
part on a mori public and coinliicuous tlheatre. The ifence in
which he. appeared requircd talents of (difCrent kinds : military
virtue, and political difcerrinent, were equally ncccflnry in order
to render himn illustrious. These lhe ponclhcd in an emninent degree.
To the mofi unquestionable pcrfonal l)ravery, lhe added great tfill
in the art of war, and in every entcrprilf his arms were crowned
with success. I-Iis sagacity and penetration in civil affairs enabled
him, amidlf the reeling and turbulence of factions, to hold a
prolf erous couri'; vwhile his boldness in defence of the Reform-
ation, together with the decency, and even severity, of his man-
ners, fccured him the reputation of being inlcercly attached to
religion, without which it was impossible in that age to gain an
a!cendant over mankind.

I'r was not witlhout rcafon that the queen dreaded the enmlity

of a man io capable to obstruct her dcligns. As she could not,
witi all her address, make the leafl impreflion on his fidelity to
his aflbciates, ihle endeavoured to lessen his influence, and to icattcr
amlong tlhemi the feeds ofjcaloufy and diflruft, by insinuating tiat
the ambition of the prior aspircd beyond tie condition of a fubjedt,
and aimed at nothing lcfs than the crown itself.

AN accuiation so improbable gaincd but little credit. What-

ploy, in defence of helr rights, the forces of a kingdom much
more pov-e'eri thian her own ; and to ftbiftitute in her place, a
pcrfon sxiwhom the illegitimacy of his birth, by the praclice of all
civilized nations, rendered incapable of any inheritance either
public or private, was a projc t b chimerical as the niofP extra-
vagant almbition would hardly entertain, and could never conceive
to l)e I'racicable. The promile too, which the prior made to
Milclvil, of rcfiding conLlantly iln Irance, on condition the public
grievances were redrelcid' ; the confidence reposed in him by
tic duke of Chlatclhcrault and his son, the presumptive heirs to
the crown; and the concurrence of almost all the Scottish nobles,
in promloting the mcanibrcs by wihich he gave offence to the French
curtI, go far towards his ivindication from tliofe illegal and crimi-

terms, their diflatisfaclion with the meafurcs lile was pursuing,
and beseeching her to quiet the fears and jealousics of the nation
by desisting from fortifying Leith. The queen, conscious of her
present advantageous situation, and elated with the hopes of frefli
succours, was in no disposition for liltcning to demands utterly
inconfiftcnt with her views, and urged with that bold importunity
which is so little acceptable to princes'.

The rtcgnt modation. As the cucen was ready on all occasions to discover
dhirfregon an extraordinry deference for the opinions of her countrymen,

mcafures they were driving on, took care to place near her such
persons as betrayed her, by their insinuations, into many aaions,
which her own unbiaffed judgment would have highly condemned.
As their fucccfs in the present junCture, when all tlhigs were
hafcening towards a crisis, depended entirely on the queen's firm-
ncfs, the princes of Lorrain did not trust wholly to the influence
of their ordinary agents; but, in order to add the greater weight
to their councils, they called in aid the ministers of religion
and, by the authority of their sacred character, they hoped effec-
tually to recommend to their filter, that system of severity which
they had espoused". ` With this view, but under pretence of
confounding the protestants by the skill of such able masters in
controversy, they appointed several French divines to reside in
Scotland. At the head of there, and with the charaEter of legate
from the pope, was Pclleve bishop of Amiens, and afterwards
archbiflop and cardinal of Sens, a furious bigot ", servilely devoted
to the house of Guise, and a proper instrument for recommending
or executing the most outrageous measures.

AMIDST the noise and danger of civil arms, these dodcors had

little opportunity to display their address in the use of their theo-
logical weapons. But they gave no finall offence to the nation by
one of their actions. They persuaded the queen to seize the

NOR did the queen mean while neglec to have recourse to

those arts which flhe had often employed to weaken or divide her
advcrfarics. Br private iolicitations and promises lhe /hook the
fidelity, or abated the ardour, of fomie. By open reproach and
accusation she blalecl the reputation, and diminifled the authority
of others. Her emiflaries were every where at work, and not-
withstanding the zeal for religion and liberty, which then ani-
mated the nation, they seem to have laboured not without success.
WVe find Knox, about this period, abounding in complaints of the

they conceived to be destructive to the peace and liberty of the
kingdom; and in this address they spoke in a firmer tone, and
avowed, more openly than ever, their resolution of proceeding to
the utmofl extremities, in order to put a flop to such dangerous
encroachments. To a remonfirance of this nature, and urged
with so much boldness, the queen replied in terms no less vigorous.

placed in the firongeft light. On all these accounts, the Congre-
gation maintained, that the nobles, as counfillors by birth-right
to their monarchs, and the guardians and defenders of the
confituti on, had a right to intcrpotc ; and therefbre, by virtue
of this right, in the name of the king and queen, and with
many exprellions of duty and flibmiffion towards them, they
deprived the queen regent of her office, and ordained that, for

B3 0 O0 VIOLENT as this adion may appear, there wanted not prin-

--- ' ciples in the constitution, nor precedents in the history of Scotland,

55 to justify and to authoriic it. Under the ariftocratical form of

government established among the Scots, the power of the fove-
reign was extremely limited. The more considerable nobles were
themselves petty princes, poiTefling cxtenfive jurisdiCtions, alnoft
independent of the crown, and followed by numerous vassals,
who, in every contest, espoused their chieftain's quarrel, in oppo-
fition to the king. HI-ence the many instances of the impotence
of regal authority, which are to be found in the Scottifl history.
In every age, the nobles not only claimed, but cxercifed, the right
of controlling the king. Jealous of their privileges, and ever
ready to take the field in defence of them, every error in admi-
niftration was observed, every encroachment upon the rights of
the aristocracy excited indignation, and no prince ever ventured
to transgress the boundaries which the law had prescribed to pre-
rogative, without meeting resistance, ,which shook or overturned
his throne. Encouraged by the spirit of the conflitution, and
countenanced by the example of their ancestors, the lords of the
Congregation thought it incumbent on them, at this juncture,
to inquire into the mal-administration of the queen regent,
and to preserve their country from being enslaved or con-
quered, by depriving her of the power to execute such a per-
nicious scheme.

TIIE a& of deprivation, and a letter from the lords of the

Congregation to the queen regent, are flill extant . They dif-
cover not only that macfuline and undaunted spirit, natural to
men capable of so bold a resolution; but are remarkable for a

ON this second blo\w, the hopes and spirits of the Congregation

liunk altogetler. They did not think themfelvbes secure even within
the walls of Edinburgh, but inflantly determined to retire to fomc

of St. Andrewl's, and a few others, oppose this cowardly and igno-
minious flight. The dread of the present dlanger prevailed over

fluctuated in a ftatc of irrcfolution, and did not act heartily for
the common cause. Lord Erskine, governor of Edinburgh cafllc,

B o o K tion to their cauif. Maitland had early applied to public bufinc fs
_ ----. admirable natural talents, improved by an acquaintance with the

' ;9' liberal arts; and at a time of life whin his countrymen of tlhe lamne

quality were following tlic pleafurcs of the chacc, or serving as ad-
venturers in the armiei of France, he was admitted into all the
secrets of the cabinet, and put uponl a level with persons of the
most confummatc experience in the management of afitirs. He
pofieffcd, in an eminent degree, that intrepid spirit which delights
;l pursuing bold deligns, and was no lets master of that political
dexterity which is neccetllry for carrying them on with success.
But these qualities were deeply tindiured with the neighbourn-
vices. I-s address fonctimes degenerated into cunning; his
acuteness bordered upon exces ; his invention, over-fertile, fug-
gefed to him, on bime occasions, chimerical systems of policy, too
refined for the genius of his age or country; and his enterprifinl
3pirit engaged him in projcEs vanl and filendid, but beyond his
-ttmofL power to execute. All the cotemporary wvriters, to /what-
evcr lfaCion they belong, mention him with an admiration which
notling could have excited but the grcatcfe superiority of penceration
and abilities.

Tunr precipitate retreat of the Congregation increascd to fich a

degree the terror and confusion which had seized the party at Ediin-
burgh, that, before the army reached Stirling, it dwindled to an in-
conliderable number. The jfpirit of Knox, howeevr, still remained
undaunted and ercl, and having mounted the pulpit, he addreiehd,

in which they had so fatally experienced their own wcakncis, and
the ftrcngth of their adversaries. MIaitland, as the mofl able nc-
groeiator of the party, was employed in t!is embafly. In lhis ab-

ditinifs their followers, worn out by the fatigues of a campaign
which had lo far exceeded the usual time of service. But, in or-
der to preserve tlie counties mofi: devoted to their interest, the
prior of St. Anlrew's, with part of the leaders, retired into IiilC.
The (luke of Chatelherault, with the reit, fixed his refidcnce at
Hamilton. There was little need of Mlailand's addrels or elu-
quence to induce Elizabeth to take his country under her protecdion.

the consideration of her privy council, still remain';; they are
entitled, " A short difcuflion of the weighty matter of Scotland,"
and do honour to the indulsry and penetration of that great mi-
niflcr. The motives which determined the queen to cfpoure so
warmly the defence of the Congrcgation, arc represented with per-
fpiicuity and force; and the consequences of fulrfering the French
to eftablifl themfclves in Scotland, arc preldiaccd with great accu-
racy and discernment.

-IE lays it down as a principle, agreeable to the laws both of

God and of nature, that every focicty hath a right to defend itlelf,
not only from present dangers, but from ifch as may probably
cnfue; to which he adds, that nature and rcalon teach every
prince to defend himfllf by the Ihme means vlhich his adversaries
employ to ilifirefs him. Upon tlicel grounds he cflabliflies the
right of England to interpose in the affairs of Scotland, and to
prevent the colnqulcf of that kingidom, at which the French openly
aimed. The French, hle obfervcs, are the ancient and implacable
enemies of England. I-Ioilities had ihbfiifled between the two
uations for many centuries. No treaty of peace into lwhich they
entered had ever been cordial or sincere. No good cflcd. was there-
fore to be expcled from the peace lately agreed upon, which, being
extorted by prefcnt neceflity, would be negligently observcd, and
broken on the slightest pretences. In a very short time, France
would recover its former opulence; and though now drained of

English nation. Tlhey openly called in qucflion the legitimacy of
the cqueen's birth, and by advancing the title and lprctcnlions of
their niece the queen of Scotland, studicd to deprive lElixabcth of
her crown. WVith this view, they had labourcd to exclude the
E:nglish from the treaty of Chateau en Cambrifis, and cndcavourcd
to conclude a feparatc peace with Spain. They had pcrluatdcd
I-lenry It. to permit his dauglter-in-law to afulnmc the title and
arms of queen of England ; and even since the conclusion of the
peace, they lhad solicited at Rome, and obtained, a bull declariii,
I lizabctl's birth to be illegitimate. Though thle wvitom and mo-
dcration of the Conflable Montmorency had for foine tine cleckcd
their career, yet there refiraints being now rc:noved by the death
of Henry II. and the dilgrace of his minificr, the utmoil exccfle'-
of violence were to be dreaded from their inrious amlbition,
armed with fovcreign power. Scotland is the quarter wlhence
they can attack England wvith most advantage. A war on the
borders of that country cxpofis France to no danger, but one un-
hiccelisful alcion there may hazard the crown, and overturn tlle
government, of England. In political conduct, it is childlii to
wait till the dcfigns of an enemy be ripe for execution. The
Scottifil nobles, after their utmost cfforts, have been obliged to
quit the field ; and far from cxpclling the invadcrs of their liberties,
they behold the French power daily increasing, and lmut at last
cease from ifruggling'any longer in a contefl so unequal. Tlce invad-
ing of England will immediately follow the reduction of the Scottish
malecontents, by the abandoning of whom to the mercy of the
French, Elizabcth will open a way for her enemics into the heart

r 0 0 K AT first the French endeavoured to keep poflefion of the Hawk
ill
- Hill, a riling ground not far distant from the town, but were beat

156o.
April 15. from it with great slaughter, chiefly by the furious attack of the

Scottish cavalry. Within a few days the French had their full
revenge; having rallied out with a strong body, they entered the
English trenches, broke their troops, nailed part of their cannon,
and killed at least double the number they had loft in the former
fkirmiih. Nor were the English more fortunate in an attempt
which they made to take the place by aflault; they were met with
May 7. equal courage, and repulsed with considerable loss. From the de-

tail of these circumstances by the writers of that age, it is easy to
observe the different charaCters of the French and English troops.
The former, trained to war under the a&tive reigns of Francis 1.
and Henry II. defended themselves not only with the bravery but
with the skill of veterans. The latter, who had been more ac-
customed to peace, still preserved the intrepid and desperate valour
peculiar to the nation, but discovered few marks of military genius,
or of experience in the practice of war. Every misfortune or
disappointment during the siege must be imputed to manifest errors
in conduct. The success of the besieged in their sally was owing
entirely to the security and negligence of the Englifl: many of
their officers were absent; their soldiers had left their stations;
and the trenches were almost without a guard '. The ladders,
which had been provided for the assault, wanted a great deal of
the necessary length; and the troops employed in that service were
ill supported. The trenches were opened at first in an improper
place; and as it was found expedient to change the ground, both
time and labour were loft. The weakness of their own generals,
no less than the strength of the French garrison, rendered the pro-

grefs of the Englifll wonderfully flow. The long continuance, B o o K
however, of the siege, and the loss of part of their magazines by --.-
an accidental fire, reduced the French to extreme difirefs for want
of provisions, which the profpea of relief made them bear with
admirable fortitude.

WHIILE the hopes and courage of the French protraaed the siege

so far beyond expecation, the leaders of the Congregation were
not idle. By new aflbciations and confederacies, they laboured to
unite their party more perfecly. By publicly ratifying the treaty
concluded at Berwick, they endeavoured to render the alliance with
England firm and indissoluble. Among the fulfcribers of thcfe
papers we find the earl of Huntly, and ibme others, who had not
hitherto concurred with the Congregation in any of their lmea-
fures ". Several of these lords, particularly the earl of Huntly,
itill adhered to the popifll church ; but on this occasion neither
their religious fentinents, nor their former cautious maxims, were
regarded; the torrent of national resentment and indignation

vice, poisoncd all these great qualities, and rendered her govern-
mcnt unfortunate , and hcr name odious. Devoted to the interefl
of France, her native country, and attached to the princes of
Lorrain, her brothers, with moit pafilonate fondness; she departed,
in order to gratify them, fiom every maxim which her own wis-
dom or humanity would have approved. She outlived, in a great
meafurc, that reputation and popularity which had smoothed her
way to the highcft flation in the kingdom; and many examples of
falsehood, and some of severity, in the latter part of her admini-
firation, alienated from her the affec&ions of a people who had
once placed in her an unbounded confidence. But, even by her
enemies, these unjustifiable aCtions were imputed to the facility,
not to the malignity, of her nature; and while they taxed her
brothers and French counsellors with rashness and cruelty, they
flill allowed her the praise of prudence and of lenityc. A few-
days before her death, she desired an interview with the prior of
St. Andrew's, the earl of Argyll, and other chiefs of the Congre-

their party in Scotland with continual expectations of tle latter,
and had thereby kept alive their hopes and their courage; but at
lafl, the situation of France, rather than the terror of the English
arms, or the remonirances of the Scottifl malecontents, constrained
them, though with reluctance, to turn their thoughts towards
pacific councils. The protcftants in France were at that time a
party formidable by their number, and more by the valour and
enterprising genius of their leaders. Francis II. had treated them.
with extreme rigour, and discovered, by every ftep he took, a
fettled resolution to extirpate their religion, and to ruin those who
profcfcd it. At the prolpect of this danger to themfcelves and to
their cause, the proteflants were alarmed, but not terrified. Ani-
mated with zeal, and inflamed with resentment, they not only
prepared for their own defence, but resolvcd, by binm bold ation,
to anticipate the Ichemes of their enemies; and as the princes of
Lorrain were deemed the authors of all the king's violent mcaluircs,

March 1,. dcfign, it was cafy to observe new storms gathering in every pro-

house of Lorrain was called off from the thoughts'of foreign con-
qucfs, to defend the honour and dignity of the French crown,
and instead of fending new reinforcements into Scotland, it be-
came neceflary to withdraw the veteran troops already employed
in that kingdom f.

The negoci. IN order to conduCt an affair of so much importance and deli-
ailons for
that puipOrfc cacy, the princes of Lorrain made choice of Monluc bishop of

Valence, and of the fieur de Randan. As both there, especially
the former, were reckoned inferior to no persons of that age in
address and political refinement, Elizabeth opposed to them ambaf-
fadors of equal abilities; Cecil her prime minister, a man perhaps
of the greatest capacity who had ever held that office; and Wotton
dcan of Cantercury, grown old in the art of negociating under
three tiicccfl.vc monarchs. The interests of the French and Englifl
courts were soon adjulted by men of so great dexterity in business;
and as France calily consented to withdraw those forces which had
been the chief occasion of the war, the other points in diipute
between that kingdom and England, were not matters of tedious
- r of diflicult discussion.

gion which they had embraced, the Scottish nobles could not think
themselves secure, without fixing some new barrier againtf tile
future encroachments of regal power. But the legal fleps towards
accoimplifhing this were not so obvious. The French ambafildors
confidered the entering into any treaty with fubjeds, and with
rebels, as a condescension unsuitable to the dignity of a sovereign;
and their fcrtiples on this head might have put an end to the
treaty, if the impatience of both parties for peace liad not 1tig-
gefled an expedient, which seemed to provide for the iecurity of
the ubljed, without derogating from the honour of the prince.
The Scottifi nobles agreed, on this occasion, to pass from the Articles of

point of right and privilege, and to accept the redress of their
grievances as a matter of favour. WVhatever additional fccurity
their anxiety for personal fafcty, or their zeal for public liberty,
prompted them to demand, was granted in the name of Francis
and Mary, as acts of their royal favour and indulgence. And
left conceflions of this kind fioulld seem precarious, and liable to
be retracted by the fame power which had made them, the French
ambafillor agreed to inelrt them in the treaty with Elizabeth,
and thereby to bind the king and queen inviolably to oblerve
them '.

Tuly 6. OI-INOURABLE as this article was for Elizabeth herself, the con-

ditions she obtained for her allies the Scots were no less advan-
tageous to them. Monluc and Randan consented, in the name of
Francis and Mary, that the French forces in Scotland should in-
ilantly be sent back into their own country, and no foreign troops
be hereafter introduced into the kingdom without the knowledge
and confcnt of parliament; that the fortifications of Leith and
Dunbar fllould immediately be rafed, and no new fort be erected
without the permission of parliament; that a parliament flould
be held on the first day of August, and that aflembly be deemed
as valid in all re-fpctes as if it had been called by the express com-
mandment of the king and queen; that, conformable to the an-

and queen fhlould not, under colour of punifling any violation of
their authority dutring that period, seek to deprive any of their
subjecTs of the oflices, benefices, or estates which they now held;
that the redress due to churchmen, for the injuries which they had
sustained during the late infurreelions, filould be left entirely
to the cognizance of parliament. With regard to religious con-
troverfies, the ambassadors declared that they would not presume
to decide, but permitteJ the parliament, at their first meeting, to
examine the points in diflerence, and to repre`ent their fenfi of
th-cm to the king and queen .

To such a memorable period did the lords of the Congregation, Tle cffcdtsof

by their courage and perseverance, conduct an enterprise which at it.
firfi promised a very dif'erent iflue. From beginnings extremely
feeble, and even contemptible, the party grew by degrees to
great power ; and being favoured by many fortunate incidents,
baffled all the eflbrts of their own queen, aided by the forces of
a more considerable kingdom. The sovereign authority was by
this treaty transferred wholly into the hands of the Congregation;
that limited prerogative, which the crown had hitherto pofeiffcd,
was almost entirely annihilated; and the ariftocratical power,
which always predominated in the Scottish government, became
supreme and incontrolable. By this treaty too the influence of
France, vhich had long been of much weight in the affairs of
Scotland, was greatly diminilhed ; and not only were the present
encroachments of that ambitious ally restrainel, but, by confe-

the approaching parliament. A meeting, summoned in a manner
so extraordinary, at such a critical junlcure, and to deliberate
upon matters of so much consequence, was expeced with the
utmost anxiety.

A SCOTTISH parliament, suitable to the ariflocratical genius of-

the government, was properly an aflembly of the nobles. It was.
composed of bishops, abbots, barons, and a few commifloners of
boroughs, who met all together in one house. The lesser barons,
though possessed of a right to be present, either in person, or by their
repreIentatives, seldom exercised it. The expence of attending,
according to the fashion of the times, with a numerous train of
vassals and dependants ; the inattention of a martial age to the
forms and detail of civil government ; but above all, the exorbi-
tant authority of the greater nobles, ,whlo had drawn the whole
power into their ovwn hands, made this privilege of so little value,.
as to be almost neglected. It appears from the ancient rolls, that
during times of tranquillity, few commi1fioners of boroughs,. and
almost none of the lesser barons, appeared in parliament. The
ordinary administration of government was abandoned, without
scruple or jealousy, to the king and to the greater barons. But

13 in

in extraordinary conjuncaures, when the flruggle for liberty was IB 0I°
violent, and the spirit of opposition to the crown rose to an height, --
the burgeftcs and lefler barons were routed from their inaftivity, 56
and fiood forth to vindicate the rights of their country. The tur-
bulent reign of James III. affords examples in proof of this ob-
servation k. The public indignation against the rafli designs of
that weak and ill-advifed prince, brought into parliament, besides
the greater nobles and prelates, a considerable number of the lecfer
barons.

ders of men to the parliament, which met on the firll of AugufLt
The universal paflion for libcrty, civil and religious, which had
seized the nation, fifliered few persons to remain unconccrned
fpedators of an aflembly, whole ads were likely to prove decisive
with refpe&l to both. From all corners of the kingdom men.
flocked in, eager and determined to aid, with their voices in the
senate, the fame cause which they had defended with their swords
in the field. Betides a full convention of peers, temporal and
spiritual, there appeared the repreftntatives of almo:f all the bo-
roughs, and above an hundred barons, who, though of the lcil.r
order, were gentlemen of the first rank and fortune in the nation '.

THi- parliament was ready to enter on btfinefs writh the utlrmon

zeal, whlen a difficulty was started concerning the lawfilncls of the
meeting. No commiifioner appeared in the name of the king and
queen, and no signification of their content and approbation was
yet received. These were deemed by many efential to the very
being of a parliament. But, in opposition to this sentiment, the

this assembly was declared to be as valid, in all refpeds, as if it had
1O.5 been called and appointed by the express command of the king

numbered their adversaries, the latter opinion prevailed. Their
boldest leaders, and those of most approved zeal, were chosen to
be lords of the articles, who formed a committee of ancient use9
and of great importance in the Scottish parliament "'. The deli-
berations of the lords of the articles were carried on with the
most unanimous and acive zeal. The aa of oblivion, the nomi-

who had adopted the principles of the Reformation. Many
doctrincs of the popilh church were a contradidcion to reason
and a difgracc to religion ; its discipline had become corrupt and
opprellive; and its revenues were both exorbitant and ill-applied,
Against all these the proteflants remonPfrated with the utmost
asperity of style, which indignation at their absurdity, or. expe-

were present in this parliament. But during thcle vigorous pro- --,-

ceedings of the proteftlnts, thcy flood confounded and at gaze;
and persevered in a silence which was fatal to their cauli:. They
deemed it impossible to rcfift or divert that torrent of religious
zeal, iwhiclh was still in its full firength; they dreaded that their
opposition would irritate their adverlfries and excite them to new
acts of violence; they lopcd that the king and queen would soon,
be at leisure to put a flop to the career of their insolent fuljcds,
and that, after the rage and havoc of the present storm, the former
tranquillity and order wduld be reflorcd to the church and king-
dom. Tliey were willing, perhaps, to iacrilice the dodrine, and
even the powver of the chrceh, in order to cnfure the safety of
their own persons, and to preserve the ponlcflion of those revenues
which were Rill in their hands. From whatever motives they
acted, their silence, vlwhich was imputed to tlhe confcioufncfs of
a bad cause, afiorded matter of great triumphl to the prote tants,
and encouraged them to proceed with more boldness and ala-
crity .

to the forfeiture of his goods, and to a corporal punifinment, at
the discretion of the judge; banishment was the penalty of a
second violation of the law; and a third ac of disobedience was
declared to be capitalr. Such firangers were men at that time to
the spirit of toleration, and to the laws of humanity; and with
iuch indecent haste did the very persons who had just escaped the
rigour of ecclesiastical tyranny, proceed to imitate those examples
of severity of which they thenfelves had so justly complained.

Vitlh regard TIIE vigorous zeal of the parliament overturned in a few
to tile reve-
nltesofthe days the ancient fyltem of religion, which had been eftabliflld so
ch urch.

many ages. In reforming the docrine and diicipline of the church,
the nobles kept pace with the ardour and expectations even of
Knox lim'felf. But their proceedings, with respect to these, were
not more rapid and impetuous, than they were flowand dilatory when
they entered on the consideration of ccclefiaftical revenues. Among
the lay members, some were already enriclled with the fjloils of
the church, and others devoured in expccation the wealthy be-
neficcs which 1ill remained untouched. The alteration in religion
had aflorded many of the digniied ecclefiaflics themselves an op-
portunity of gratifying their avarice or ambition. The denio-
lition of the monaflcrics having set tlhe monks at liberty from their
coniincment, they infiantlv diliperfed all over the kingdom, and
connmonly betook tlhemfelves to some secular employnment. The
abbot, if he had been to fortunate as to embrace the principles of
.lle Reformation fiom conviction, or so cunning as to clfpoule tlhem

rKnox, 254,

cut

out of policy, seized the whole revenues of the fraternity, and, B 1° l
except what he allowed for the subsistence of a few superannuated --
monks', applied them entirely to his own use. The propofial
made by the reformed teachers, for applying these revenues towards
the maintenance ofminifters, the education of youth, and the Ifupport
of the poor, was equally dreaded by all these orders of men. They
opposed it with the utmolft warmth, and by their numbers and
authority easily prevailed on the parliament to give no ear to fitch
a disagreeable demand '. Zealous as the Iirfl reformers were, and
animated with a spirit fupcrior to the low considerations of intei'efit
they beheld thele early symptoms of felfiflnefs and avarice among.
their adherents with amazement and sorrow; and we Iind Knox
exprefling tle utmofl sensibility of that contempt with whiclh
they were treated by many from whom he expcted a more generous
concern fbr the success of religion and the honour of its.
ministers ".

A DIFFICULTY hath been started with regard to the acs of ThevaliJity

of this parlia-

this parliament concerning religion. This difficulty, which at ment called
such a distance of time is of no importance, was founded on the " queon
words of the treaty of Edinburgh. By that, the parliament was
permitted to take into consideration the state of religion, and to-
signify their sentiments of it to. the king and queen. But, inflead
of presenting their defr-es to their sovereigns in the humble forrn
of a supplication or addrels, the parliament converted them into
so many ads; which, although they never received the royal
afient, obtained, all. over the kingdom, the weight and authority
of laws. In compliance with their injunCtions,. the eftablilhed
system of religion was every where overthrown, and that recon--

mended'

o0 o K mended by the reformers introduced in its place. The partiality
----- .-r- and zeal of the people overlooked or supplied any defet in the
15 *0. form of these ads of parliament, and rendered the observance of

them more universal than ever had been yielded to the statutes of
the most regular or conflitutional assembly. By those proceedings
it must, however, be confessed that the parliament, or rather the
nation, violated the last article in the treaty of Edinburgh, and
even exceeded the powers which belong to fubjecs. But when
once men have been accustomed to break through the common
boundaries of fubjecion, and their minds are inflamed with the
paflions which civil war inspires, it is mere pedantry or ignorance
to measure their conduaE by those rules, which can be applied only
vwhere government is in a state of order and tranquillity. A nation,
when obliged to employ such extraordinary efforts in defence of
its liberties, avails itself of every thing which can promote this
great end; and the neceflity of the cafe, as well as the importance
of the objet-, juflify any departure from the common and efta-
blifled rules of the conflitution.

Ani-bat.idors IN consequence of the treaty of Edinburgh, as well as by the
tent by the
parlinment to ordinary forms of business, it became neceflary to lay the pro-
.'rancec, ceedings of parliament before the king and queen. For thlis pur-

pose, fir James Sandilands of Calder lord St. John, was appointed
to repair to the court of France. After holding a course so irrc-
gular, the leaders of the Congregation had no reason to flatter
themselves that Francis and Mary would ever approve their con-
dua, or confirm it by their royal assent. The reception of their
ambassador was no other than they might have expecled. He
was treated by the king and queen with the utmost coldness, and
difinifTed without obtaining the ratification or the parliament's
proceedings. From the princes of Lorrain, and their partisans, lie

many remarkable events, there happencd one of great importance.
On Ihe fourth of December died Francis II. a prince of a feeble
conllitution, and of a mean underflanding. As he did not leave
any ifice by the queen, no incident could have been more for--
tunate to thofc wvho, during thc late commotions in Scotland, liha
taken part with the Congregation. n ary, by the charms of her
beauty, had acquir-cd an entire aiccndant over her lhufand ; and-
as flie transfcrred all her influence to her uncles the princes of
Lorrain, Francis followed them implicitly in whatever track they
were pleaccl to lead him. 'The power of France, under fuchl
direclion, alarmned tlhe Scottilil malecontents wit apprehensions of
danler, no c lets ;irmidalle than well founded. The intefline dill
orlder:; which raged in France, and the frafonable interpolktion. of
F. ngland in behalf of the aCongregation, had hitherto prevented
thei princes of Lorrain from carrying their designs upon Scotland
into cxccutlion. But under their vigorous and decisive admini--
.lration, it was iilpofliblc tliat the commotions in France could be.

others coveted the \xeaoll,, of ,lie dignifiedclergy; and by aho-
liliing tlhat order of mcn, the forlmer indulged their relfntncnt,
and the lattcr loped to gr1atit thlcir a;:,ri ce. Thle people, inflamed
with thle moilt ioienit avcrfliol to popry), and approving of every
Iclcnme that departed fiarthc!l from the pracdice of the Romiflh
clurcli, vwere cllighted with a 'ftlem i) admirably suitcd to their
.redominant paflion: while the fricnds of civil liberty beheld
with pl easure the protcftant clergy pulling down withl their own
liands that fabric of cccleliaftical power which their predeceflors
had reared with to much art and induifry; and flattered tlhen-
felvcs, that by lending their aid to flrip churchmen of their dig-
nity an1d xwealth, they mighlt entirely deliver the nation from thei.:
cxorblitanlt and opp)rcfhive jiirilfliclionl. The nclew mode of govern-
mcnt calily made its \way among men thus prepared, by their va-
rious intcrcfis and palfiois, for its reception.

BUT at this junLture, the princes of Lorrain wcre not dijlpofcd

to liflcn to this extravagant and dangerous propoll. Intent on

policy was employed in undermining their exorbitant power, they
had no Iciturc to attend to the afiaiis of Scotland1, and wiflcd
their niece to take poflucion of her kingdom wlith as little dif-
turbance as poliblc. The French oflicers too, who had served in
Scotland, difluadcd NMary from all violent incafurcs; and, by re-
prfclentiln the power and number of tlie protcflants to he irre-
fiftible, determined her to court tlicm by every art; and rather
to employ the leading men of that party as miniftcrs, than to pro-
oke them,, by a fruitlcfs opposition, to become her enemies .

B o O K this meeting. He was inflirulcd to solicit the Scots to renew their
--- --. ancient alliance with France, to break their new confederacy with

England, and to reflore tlhe popifli ecclefiafiics to the poffeifion of
their revenues and the exerciif of their funcdions. It is no easy
matter to form any conjecQure concerning the intentions of the
French court in making these extraordinary and ill-timed propofi-
tions. They were rejeEedl with that scorn which might well have
been expecqed from the temper of the nation '.

IN this convention, the protcftant clergy did not obtain a more

favourable audience than formerly, and their profpeac of recover-
ing the patrimony of the church still remained as diflant and
uncertain as ever. But, with regard to another point, they found
the zeal of the nobles in no degree abated. The book of discipline
feemeed to require that the ronouments of popery, which frill re-
mained in the kingdom, fliould be dcmolifhed':; and, though neither
the fame prctcence of policy, nor the fame ungovernable rage of the
people, remained to jiftify or exlcne this barbarous havoc, the con-
vention, confidering every religious fabric as a relic of idolatry,
pasTed fcntence upon then by an acd in form; and persons the most
remarkable for tlhe acivityof their zeal, were appointed to-put it in
execution. Abbies, cathedrals, churches, libraries, records, and even
the fepulchrcs of the dead, pcrifhcdl in one common ruin. The
florm of popular infurlrciion, though impetuous and irrefifiible, had
extended only to a few counties, and soon spent its rage; but now

every thing venerable and magnificent which had escaped its
violence .

sented her with a ve'y disere nt !-tce of thlilg. ITle impatience,
however, of her people, the pcrlllafiois of her uncles, but above
all, the tudiedl and mortifying ncle wsith llicll fle wvas treated
by the queen mother, forced her to think of begilnnll this dif-
agreeal)le voyage But lwhile ilhe was

were fovn between her and ]Elizabeth tlec tCeds oi that pcrlbnal
jealouly an(l dilcord, whlich cmbittered tlc life and h{lortencd the
days of the Scottilh oquccn.

TIE ratiication of the late treaty) of Edilurghl was the ni- o ;.,, oi-,he

mediate occasion of this fatal animiolityl; the true cauf s of ii lay dif^,,d be-
much deeper. Almoift every article in that treaty had been cxc- a"ld EliZa-

beth.

cuted by both parties wkitl a icltirullous exacllls. The fbrtifi-
cations of Leith were demolified, and the armies of France and
England withdrawn wit hin tlhe appointed time. The grieivances
of the Scottish malccontints were rc'(lrcleJ, and they had obtained
whatever tlicy could dmcnandi for their fiuture l urity. \Vith 1regard
to all tlielb, Mary could have little rcafon to dcclinc, or Elizabeth
to urge, the ratification of the treaty.

T-lE sixth article remained the only source of conteit and dif-

ficulty. No miniifler ever entered more deeply into the Ifhlencs
of his fovcreign, or pursued them with iore dexterity and fliccefS,
than Cecil. In the conlduc of the negociationI at Edinburgi the

B' o o K found understanding of this able politician had proved greatly an

iII. li---. overmatch for Monluc's refinements in intrigue, and had artfully
1561. induced the French ambaiaadors, not only to acknowledge that

the crowns of England and Ireland did of right belong to Eli-
zabeth alone, but albo to promise, that in all times to come MIary
ihould abstain from using the titles, or bearing the arms, of those
kingdoms.

TInE ratification of this article would have been of the most

fatal consequence to Mary. The crown of England was an objea
worthy of her ambition. Her pretensions to it gave her great
dignity and importance in the eyes of all Europe. By many,
her title was esteemed preferable to that of Elizabeth. Among
the English themfelvcs, the Roman catholics, who formed at that
time a numerous and active party, openly cfpoufed this opinion;
and even the proteflants, who fuppiorted Elizabeth's throne, could
not deny the queen of Scots to be her immediate heir. A proper
opportunity to avail hericlf of all these advantages could not,
in the course of tliings, be far difltant, and many incidents might
fall in, to bring this opportunity nearer than was expedted. In
these circumftanccs Mary, by ratifying the article in diiputc, would
have loft that rank which flhe had hitherto held among neighbour-
ing princes; the zeal of her adherents muil have gradually cooled;
and fie might have renounced, from that moment, all hopes of
ever wearing the Englifl crown.

NONE of these beneficial confcquences escaped the penetrating

eye of Elizabeth, who, for this realon, had recourse to every thing
by which file could hope either to sooth or frighten the Scottifi

queen

queen into a compliance with her demands; and if that princess B 0 O I

1i.

had been to unadvised as to ratify the rash concefflons of her am- ,
bafFadors, Elizabeth, by that deed, would have acquired an ad- i561.
vantage, which, under her management, mLiuft have turned to
great account. By ifch a renunciation, the quefrion with regard
to the right of fuccefion would have been left altogether open
and undecided ; and, by means of tlat, Elizabeth mi ght cither
have kept her rival in perpetual anxiety and dependell ce, or, by
the authority of her parliament, the might have broken in upon
the order of lineal isucceiion, and transferred the crown to some
other descendant of the royal blood. The former conducL fle ob-
iervcd towards James VI. whom, during his whole reign, ihe
held in perpetual fear and ifubjeaion. h'lie latter and mnore
rigorous mnetliod of proceeding would, in all probability, have
been employed againlt RMary, lwhom, for many realons, lhe both
elvied and hated.

NoR was this fltp beyond her power, unprecedented in the

iiftory, or inconfifent wititl the conflintion, of nglalnd. Though
fucceflion by hereditary right be an idea io natural and bs popular,
that it has been cftlabliflced in almoi;: every civilized nation, yet
England affords many memorable inllances of deviations from
that rule. The crown of that kingdom lhaving once been fleied by
the hand of a conqueror, this invited the bold and ilnterprifilig in
every age to imitate such an illustrious example of fortunate am-
bition. From the time of William tlie Norman, the regular
course of dcfccnt had seldom continued through three fuccelsive
reigns. Those princes, whole intrigues or valour opened to them
a way to the throne, called in tlhe authority of tle great council
of the nation to confirm their dubious titles. Hence parliamentary
and hereditary right became in England of equal confidcration.

That

B 0 0 KT That great aflTebly claimed and atually pofleflcd a power of
i_--. --- altering thle order of regal fucceflion; and even so late as

15 Henry VIII. an aa of parliament had authorircd that capricious

monarch to fettle the order of fucceflion at his picafure. The
Englifi, jealous of their religious liberty, and averse fiom the
dominion of strangers, would have eagerly adopted the paflions of
their sovereign, and might have been cafily induced to exclude
the Sccttifli line from the right of licceeding to the crown. These
seem to have been the views of both queens, and these were the
difficultics which retarded the ratification of the treaty of Edin-
burgh.

I3uT, if tle sources of their discord were to be traced no higher

tihan this treaty, an inconsiderable alteration in the words of it
might have brought the present quetlion to an amicable iiTle.
The irdefinite and atnbiguous exprlcfion which Cecil h]ad inserted
into the treaty, might have been changed into one more limited
but more precisee; and AMIary, inflead of promising to abstain from
bcaring the title of QLecn of England in all times to come, might
have lengaged, not to afnume that title during the life of Elizabeth,
or the lives of her lawful pofcrity .

Sucii

'lhis expedient for termin:tinlg the difl-rcntcc betvccn Elizabeth and Mlary

was so obvious, that it could not fail of presenting itself to the view cf the Enlifll
minfiters. " There hath been a ma.ttr fccrctly thought of (fays Cecil in a letter to
Throkmorton, July 14, 1561), which I dare communicate to you, although I
mcan never tobcean author thereof; and that is, if an accord might be made betwixt
our miflirefs and the Scottish queen, that this should by pailiament.in Scotland, &c.
iurrendcr unto the quccn's n:ajeity a'l matter cf claim, and unto the licirs of her
body; and in consideration thereof, the Scottifi queen's intcict ihouuld be ac-
lnowledged ill default of heirs ofthe body of the queen's majeily. \Vcl God fend
ourmiflrcfs a husband, and by time a ion, that we may hope cur pofierity hiall
have a masculine fucceflion. This matter is too big for weak folks, and too deep
for fiiple. The queen's majesty knoweth of it." I-Iardw. State Pap. i. 174.

But

SucII an amendment, however, did not suit the views of BOO

]II.

either queen. Though i\lary had bleen obliged to iiifpend for ----
iome time t he profccution of her title to the Englilh crown, flte
had not however relinquiihel it. Sihe detcrmilned to revive her
claim on the fi-ll profpecL of ficccfs, and was unwilling to bind
herself, by a pofitivc engagenccnt, not to take advantage of any
such fortunate occurrence. Nor would tlec alteration have been
more acceptable to Elizabeth, vhc, by agreeing- to it, would have
tacitly recognised the right of her rival to acentd the throne after
her deceale. But neither the Scottili nor Englifi queen durnf
avow these fccrct sentiments of their hearts. Any open dilcovevy
of an inclination to disturb tice tranquillity of England, or to wrl'e
the sceptre out of Elizabeth's hands, might have proved fatal to
NMary. Any fiufpicion of a dcfign to alter the order of tfcccfflon,
and to set aside the claim of the Scotifli queen,, would have cx-
poscd Elizabeth to much and deserved censure, and have raised iup
againfl her many and dangerous cnemies, Thelf, however care-
fully concealed or artfully dislguiicd, were, in all probablility, tlhe
real motives which determined thle one queen to solicit, and
the other to refuse, the ratification of the treaty in its original
form; while neither had recourlf to that cxlplication of it, which
to an heart unwarpcd by political intercfl, and iimccrely dclfirous
of union and concord, would have app!ared io obvious and
natural.

But with regard to every point relating to the fucceflion, Elizabeth was to jea-
lous, and lb apt to take ofiene, that hcr molt confidential mniniiers durfl not
urge her to advianc one o tle p fLL)Cartr th.lan flc hcr'lt chorl to go. Cecil,

butcd to widenl the breach, and female jcaloufy increased the vio-
lence of their political hatred. Elizabeth, with all those extraor-
dinary qualities by which she equalled or furpanficd such of her sex
as have merited the greatef renown, discovercd an admiration of
her own person, to a degree which women of ordinary under-
flandings either do not entertain, or prudently endeavour to conceal.
I-Icr attention to dress, her solicitude to display her charms, her love
of flattery, wvcrc all exceflixe. Nor were the weaknesses con-
fined to that lpriod of life wheni they are more pardonable. Even
ill very advanced years, the wvile;: women of that, or perhaps of
any other age, wore the garb, and affc&ed the manners, of a girl'.
Though E lizabeth was as much inferior to Miary in beauty and
graccfulllnes of pelrfon, as ile excelled her in political abilities and
in the arts of government, flie was weak enough to compare her-
self with the Scottifl queen "; and as it was impoflible file could
be altogether ignorant how much Mary gained by the comparifonr

ihe envied and hated her as a rival by whom nie was eclipsed. In
judging of the conducl of princes, we are apt to ascribe too much
to political motives, and too little to the pailions which they feel
in common with the reft of mankind. In order to account for
Elizabeth's present, as well as her iubfcquent condu& towards
.Iary, we mullf not always confider her as a queen,.we must some.-
times regard her merely as a woman.

ELIZABETII, though no stranger to Mary's difficulties with re-
speCt to the treaty, continued to urge her, by repeated applications,

the Englifl coast. In older to be safe from the insults of the
Englili fleet, or, in cafe of telnpeftuous weather, to secure a re-
treat in the harbours of that kingdom, Mary sent M. D'Oyfel to
demand of Elizabeth a fafe-conduCt during her voyage. This
request, which decency alone obliged one prince to grant to
another, Elizabeth rejected, in such a manner as gave rife to no
flight suspicion of a design, either to obfftru the passage, or to
intercept the person, of the Scottifl queen '.

MARY, in a long conference with Throkmorton, the English

ambassador in France, explained her sentiments concerning this
ungenerous behaviour of his mistress, in a strain of dignified ex-
postulation, which conveys an idea of her abilities, address, and
spirit, as advantageous as any transaCtion in her reign. M\iary
was at that time only in her eighteenth year; and as Throk-
morton's account of what passed in his interview with her, is ad-
dressed directly to Elizabeth , that dexterous courtier, we may
be well assured, did not embellifli the discourse of the Scottifi
queen with any colouring too favourable.

MAar'y begins place where she embarked, in a manner suitable to her dignity,

her uncles, with many of the most eminent among the French
nobles, were in her retinue. Catherine, who secretly rejoiced at
her departure, graced it with every circumstance of magnificence
and rcfpca. After bidding adieu to her mourning attendants,
vith a fad heart, and eyes bathed in tears, Mary left that king-
dom, the flhort but only fcenc of her life in which fortune fililed
upon her. While the French coast continued in fight, she in-
tently gazed upon it, and muting, in a thoughtful posture, on that
height of fortune whence fie had fallen, and preflging, perhaps,
the disasters and calamities which embittered the remainder of her
days, flie sighed often, and cried out, " Farewel France! Farewel
" beloved country, which I shall never more behold !" Even
when the darkness of the night had hid the land from her view,
she would neither retire to the cabin, nor taste food, but com-
manding a couch to be placed on the deck, she there waited the
return of day with the utmost impatience. Fortune soothed her
on this occasion ; the galley made little way during the night. In
the morning, the coast of France was frill within fight, and she
continued to feed her melancholy with the profpcct; and as long

B 0 o K of the aristocracy, which stood not in need of any accession of
-_ ---J power. The kingdom had long been under the government of

regents, who exercised a delegated juridiclion, attended with
little authority, and which inspired no reverence. A state of pure
anarchy had prevailed for the two last years, without a regent,
without a supreme council, without the power, or even the form,
of a regular government Z. A licentious spirit, unacquainted with
subordination, and disdaining the refiraints of law and justice, had
spread among all ranks of men. The influence of France, the
ancient ally of the kingdom, was withdrawn or despised. The
English, of enemies become confederates, had grown into confi-
dence with the nation, and had gained an ascendant over all its
councils. The Scottish monarchs did not derive more splendour
or power from the friendship of the former, than they had reason
to dread injury and diminution from the interposition of the
latter. Every consideration, whether of interest or of felf-prefer-
vation, obliged Elizabeth to depress the royal authority in Scot-
land, and to create the prince perpetual difficulties, by fomenting
the spirit of diffatisfation among the people.

IN this posture were the affairs of Scotland, when the admini-

firation fell into the hands of a young queen, not nineteen years
of age, unacquainted with the manners and laws of her country,
a firanger to her fubjess, without experience, without allies, and
almflt without a friend.

ON the other hand, in Mary's situation we find some circum-

flances, which, though they did not balance these difadvantagcs,
contributed however to alleviate them; and, with skilful manage-

cufomccnd oi long to the residence of their prince, were not only -
dazzled by the novelty and splendour of the royal presence, but
inspircd with awe and reverence. Besides tle places of power
and profit beltowed by the favour of a prince, his protection,
his familiarity, and even his smiles, confer honour and win the
hearts of men. From all corners of the kingdom, the nobles
crowded to testify their duty and affedion to their fovcreign, and
studied by every art to wipe out the memory of pafi milcon-
duc&, and to lay in a stock of future merit. The anmulcmcntsand
gaiety of her court, whicl was filled with the molt accomplilhcd
of the French nobility, who had attended her, began to ioften and
to polinl the rude manners of the nation. Mary herself poflfTeed
many of those qualifcatios icctio raifc affetion and procure
esteem. The beauty and gracefilncis of her person drew universal
admiration, the elegance and politeness of her manners com-
manded general respect. To all the charms of her own fcx, fle
added many of the accompliflhments of the other. The progrcfs
she had made in all the arts and sciences, which were then deemed
necessary or ornamental, was far beyond what is commonly at-
tained by princes; and all her other qualities were rendered more
agreeable by a courteous affability, which, without lefrening the
dignity of a prince, Reals on the hearts of fubjcts witl a be-
witching insinuation.

FROM these circumstances, notwithfIanding the threatening

the clouds which gathered on every hand, a political observer would'
have predicted a very different issue of her reign; and whatever'

W\IIILE all parties were contending who should difcovcr the

mofl dutiful attachment to the queen, the zealous and impatient
ipirit of the age broke out in a remarkable inflance. On the Sun-
day after her arrival, the queen commanded mass to be celebrated
in the chapel of her palace. The lfrft rumour of this occasioned a
secret murmuring among the proteflants who attended the court;
complaints and threatcnings toon followed ; the servants belonging
to the chapel were infilted and abused ; and, if the prior of
St. Andrew's had not fcafonably interposecd, the rioters might have
proceeded to the utmofti cxcefcs '.

lr is iinpoflible, at this distance of time, and under circum-

sianccs so very dificrent, to conceive the violence of that zeal
againlft popery, which then pofltficfd the nation. Every inf;ance
of condelccnfiol to the papilrs was deemed an aC of apoflacy, and
the toleration of a iingle mass pronounced to be more formidable
to the nation than the invasion of ten thousand armed men b
Under the influence of thcfe opinions, many proterfants would
have ventured to go dangerous lengths; and, without attempting
to convince their sovereign by argument, or to reclaim her by
indulgence, would have abruptly denied her the liberty of wor-
shipping God in that manner which alone lhe thought acceptable
to him. But the prior of St. Andrew's, and other leaders of the
party, not only restrained this impetuous spirit, but, in spite of
the murmurs of the people and the exclamations of the preachers,
obtained for the queen and her domestics the undisturbed exercise

the wife of their fovercign in the private use of the mass. The

fane time, whoever rclleets upon the ncroaching and ilonguinary
spirit of popery in that age, will be far fiom treating thel fears and
caution of the more zealous reformers as altogether imaginariy and
deflitute of any real foundattion.

TIlE leaders of the proteflants, however, by this prudent com-

pliance with the prejudices of their fovcrcign, obtained from hler
a proclamation highly favourable to their religion, which w-as
issued fix days after her arrival in Scotland. The reformed doclrinc, ,\ug. 2j.
though eflabliflhed over all the kinlgdom by the parliament, which
met in confequcnce of the treaty of pacification, had never re-
ceived the countenance or fancion of royal authority. In ordcr
to quiet the minds of tholc who had embraced that doclrine, and
to remove any dread of molcftation wliicli they might entertain,
Mary declared, " that until fhle should take final orders concerning
religion, with advice of parliament, any attempt to alter or Iubvert
the religion which she found universally praaifed in the realm,
lhould be deemed a capital crime c." Next year a fccond procla-

it much at heart, in the beginning of her adminifriation, to ac-
complifh such a desirable conjuncion, yet many events occurred
to widen, rather than to clofc, the breach. The formal offices of
friendflip, however, are seldom neglected among princes; and
Elizabeth, who had attempted so openly to obftrud the queen's
voyage into Scotland, did not fail, a few days after her arrival, to
command Randolph to congratulate her safe return. Mary, that
she might be on equal terms with her, sent Maitland to the Eng-

were made with little sincerity, were listened to with proportional
credit.

TIIE cold reception of the archbifliop of St. Andrew's was

owing to hlis conniclion with tlie hloufe of H-amilton ; from which.
the queen was much alienated. The duke of Guise and the car-

the Congregation. Princes fcldom view their fucceflbrs without
jealousy and distrust. The prior of St. Andrew's, perhaps, dreaded
the duke as a rival in power. All thelf caules concurred in
infusing into the queen's mind an aversion for that family. The
duke, indulging his love of retirement, lived at a diflance from
court, without taking pains to insinuate himself into favour ; and

church were tlie only fund which could be employed for their
relief; but during the three last years the Itate of these was greatly
altered. A great majority of abbots, priors, and other lieads of
religious hlouics, had, cihlcr from a sense of duty, or fr-om views
of interefi, renounced the errors of popery ; and, notwithitand-
ing tlis change in their fcntiments, they retained their ancient
revenues. Anioft thle whole order of bishops, and fevcral of the
other dignitaries, frill adhered to the Romifli fuperRition; and
though debarrcd from every spiritual function, continued to enjoy
the temporalities of their benefices. Some laymen, especially thole
whlo had been ac2cive in promoting the Reformation, had, under
various pretences, and amidftl.the licence of civil wars, got into
their hands pofiffions vwhich belonged to the church. Thus,
before any part of the ancient ecclefiaflical revenues could be

malny diflrcnt interccfs were to be adjuled l; many claims to
be examined ; and the p'r"judices and pailions of the two con-

e----- raiscd the royal authority above controul, and have rendered the

most limited prince in Europe the moPC abfolutc and independent.
The reign of IIenry VIII. prelcnted a recent and alarming ex-
ample of this nature. The wealth which flowed in upon that
prince, from the fupprefcion of the nmcnafleries, not only changed
the maxims of his government, but the temprc of his mind ; and
he who had formerly fuiimitted to his parliaments and courted
liis people, dictated from that time to the former with intolerable
infolcnicc, and tyrannized over the latter with unprecedented Ie-
verity. And if his policy had not bccen extremely short-sightcd,
if lie htad not squandered what he acquired, with a profusion
equal to his rapacioufncfs, and wlich defeated his ambition, he
night lave cflabliflcd defpotiii in England, on a basis so broad
a!ld firong, as all the efibrts of the subjects would never have been
able to lhakc. In Scotland, where the riches of the clergy bore
as great a proportion to the wealth of the kingdom, the acquisition
of church lands would have been of no lcfs importance to the
crown, and no lecs fatal to the aristocracy. The nobles, for this
r-cafon, guarded againfl such an incrcafe of the royal power, and
thereby iecurcd their ownl independence.

Av.ARICE mingled itself with their concern for the intercft cf

their order. The re-uniting the polsilions of the church to the
crown, or the bellowing them on the protcflant clergy, would
have been a fatal blow, both to those nobles who had, by fraud
or violence, seized part of these revenues, and to those abbots and
priors who had totally renounced their eccclcfiaPical claradcr.
But as the plan which was proposed gave some fanccion to their
usurpation, they promoted it with their utmost influence. Tlie
popifli ccclefiaflics, though the lopping off a third of their revenues

¥, P.s

was by no means agreeable to them, consented, under their present B o o r1
circumstances, to sacrifice a part of their poTfefflons, in order to -_-.-
purchase the secure enjoymcnt of tle remainder; and after deeml I6y.
ing the whole irrecoverably loft, they confidered whatever they
could retrieve as so much gain. Many of the ancient dignitaries
were men of noble birth ; and as they no longer entertained hopes
of restoring the popifli religion, they wifhled their own relations,
rather than the crown, or the protcelant clergy, to be enriched
with the spoils of the church. They connived, for this reason,
at the encroachments of the nobles; they even aided their avarice
and violence; they dealt out the patrimony of the church among
their own relations, and by granting fews and perpetual leafes of
lands and tithes, gave, to the utmost of their power, tome colour
of legal poffeflion to what was formerly mere usurpation. Many
vestiges of such alienations Rill remain '. The nobles, with the
concurrence of the incumbents, daily extended their encroach-
ments, and gradually stripped the ecclcfiaftics of their riclheft and
inoft valuable poffiefions. Even that third part, which was given
up in order to silence the clamours of the protestant clergy, and to
be some equivalent to the crown for its claims, amounted to no
considerable fum. The thirds clue by the more powerful nobles,
especially by such as had embraced the Reformation, were almost
universally remitted. Others, by producing fraudulent rentals;
by estimating the corn, and other payments in kind, at an under-
value; and by the connivance of collectors, greatly diminiflled
the charge against themselves r: and the nobles had much reason
to be satisfied with a device which, at so small expence, secured to
them such vast possesSions.

been the whole fuln allotted for the maintenance of a national

and the carl of Bothwell, and was heightened by mutual injuries
during the late commotions ". The earl of Arran and Botliwell
happening to attend the court at tlhe Iame time, their followers
quarrelled frequently in the firects of Edinburgh, and excited
dangerous tumults in that city. At lafl, the mediation of their February,

he and the Hamiltons had agreed to cement their new al-

conspiracy existed only in the frantic and disordercd imagination
of the earl of Arran, it is impossible, amidst the contradiction of
hiiforians and the defedivenefs of records, positively to de-
termine. Among men inflamed with resentment and impatient
for revenge, rash expreimions might be uttered, and violent and
criminal expedients proposed; and on that foundation, Arran's
diftempcred fancy might rear the whole superstruCture of a
conspiracy. All the persons accused, denied their guilt with
the utmost confidence. But the known characters of the men,
and the violent spirit of the age, added greatly to the probability
of the accusation, and abundantly justify the conduc of the
queen's ministers, who confined Bothwell, Arran, and a few
of the ringleaders in separate prisons, and obliged the duke to
surrender the strong castle of Dumbarton, which he had held ever
since the time of his resigning the office of regent Y.

The earl of THE designs of the earl of Huntly against the prior of St. An-

cier. 5 tragical events. George Gordon earl of Huntly, having been

one of the nobles who conspired againit James III. and who raised
his son James IV. to the throne, enjoyed a great share in the
confidence of that generous prince Z. By his bounty, great ac-
cessions of wealth and power were added to a family already opu-
lent and powerful. On the death of that monarch, Alexander

beyond

beyond Forth, left the other nobles to contend for offices at coirf t;,
and retiring to the north, ,where his eslate and influncce lay, re-
fided there in a kind of princely independence. The chieftains in
that part of the kingdom dreaded the growing dominion of fucli
a dangerous neighbour, but were unable to prevent his encroach-
ments. Somc of his rivals he secretly undermined, others he
subducd by open force. H-is eflate far exceeded that of any other
subject, and hisJfiS'rioriticss and juritliLions extended over many
of the northern counties. \With 1power and pofReffions so iimmenlfe,
under two long and feeble minorities, and amidfl: the shock of
civil commotions, the carls of I-Iuntly might have indulged the
molt elevated hopes. But happily for the crown, an a&live and
enterprising spirit was not the charatceriftic of that family, and
whatever object their ambition might have in view~, they chose
rather to acquire it by political address, than to lcizc it openly,
and by force of arms.

THE- conduct of George the present earl, during the late conm-

motions, had been perfectly fultable to the characer of the family
in that age, dubious, variable, and crafty. While the success of
the lords of the Congregation was uncertain, he aitif-ed the queen
regent in her attempts to crush them. When their affairs put on
a- better aspeQ, he pretended to join them, but never heartily fa-
voured their cause. He was courted and feared by each of the
contending parties; both connived at his encroachments in the
north; and, by artifice and force, which lie well knew how to
employ alternately, and in their proper places, he added every day
to the exorbitant power and wealth which he poffefled.

the mifunderflanding occasioned by rivalihip in povwer. The
queen having determined to reward the services of the prior of
St. Andrew's, by creating him an carl, flie made choice of Mar,
as the place whence he flould take his title; and, that he might
Feb. I. be better able to support his new honour, bestowed upon him at

the fame time the lands of that name. These were part of the
royal demefines ', but the earls of I-Iuntly had been permitted, for
fcveral years, to keep poifeffion of them '. On this occasion the
carl not only complained, with tonme reason, of the loss which
he fusained, but had real'caufe to be alarmed at the intrusion of
a formidable neighbour into the heart of his territories, who might
be able to rival his power, and excite his oppressed vaflals to shake
off his yoke.
June 27. AN incident, which happened soon after, increased and con-

firmed I-luntly's suspicions. Sir John Gordon, his third son, and
lord Ogilvic, had a dispute about the property of an cftate. This
difputc becamea deadly quarrel. They happened unfortunately to
meet in the fireets of Edinburgh, and being both attended with armed
followers, a scuffle ensued, in which lord Ogilvie was dangerously
wounded by Sir John. The magistrates seized both the offenders,
and the queen commanded them to be ftritly confined. Under
any regular government, such a breach of public peace and order
would expose the person offending to certain punifliment. At this
time some severity was necessary, in order to vindicate the queen's
authority from an insult, the most heinous which had been offered

to it since her return into Scotland. But, in an age accuflomcd E 3 ° IK
to licence and anarchy, even this moderate exercise of her power, '----
in ordering them to be kept in custody, was deemed an ace of 56
intolerable rigour; and the friends of each party began to convene
their valfals and dependants, in order to overawe, or to friufrate,
the decisions ofjuftice '. Meanwhile Gordon made his escape out
of prilbn, and flying into Abcrdeenihire, complained loudly of the
indignity wvith which he had been treated; and as all the queen','s
ations were, at this jun&turc, imputed to the carl (cf Miar, this'
added not a little to the rcfcitment which I-Iuntly had conceived
against that nobleman.

AT the very time when there panfions fermented, with the utmost Auguti

violence, in the minds of the earl of I-Huntly and his family, the
queen happened to set out on a progrclf into the northern parts
of the kingdom. She was attended by the carls of Mlar and
Morton, Maitland, and other leaders of that party. The precence
of the queen, in a country where no name greater than the carl
of Huntly's had been heard of, and no power superior to his
had been exercised, for many years, was an event of itself abun-
dantly mortifying to that haughty nobleman. But while the queen
was entirely under the (lirecion of Mar, all her adions were more
apt to be miifreprefented, and coni'rued into injuries; and a thou--
land circumftalnces could not but occur to awaken Huntly'sjea-
loulf, to offend his pride, and to inflame his reientlenlt..
Amidst the agitations of so many violent paflions, some eruption
was unavoidable.

B O 0 K dexterity, to sooth the queen, and to intercede for pardon to their
i_--.- ton. But the queen peremptorily required that he should again

16 deliver himself into tie hands of juilice, and rely on her cle-

mency. Gordon was persuaded to do so; and being enjoined by
the queen to enter himself prisoner in the castle of Stirling, he
promised likewise to obey that command. Lord Erskine, Mar's
uncle, was at that time governor of this fort. The queen's fe-
verity, and the place in which she appointed Gordon to be con-
fined, were interpreted to be new marks of Mar's rancour, and
augmented the hatred of the Gordons againit him.
Sept.*. MEANTIME, Sir John Gordon set out towards Stirling; but

instead of performing his promise to the queen, made his escape
from his guards, and returned to take the command of his followers,
who were rising in arms all over the north. These were destined
to second and improve the blow, by which his father proposed,
secretly and at once, to cut off Mar, Morton, and Maitland, his
principal advcrfaries. The time and place for perpetrating this horrid
deed were frequently appointed; but the executing of it was won-
derfully prevented, by some of those unforeseen accidents, which
so often occur to disconcert the schemes, and to intimidate the
hearts, of aflaffins d. Huntly's own house at Strathbogie was the
last and most convenient scene appointed for committing the in-
tended violence. But, on her journey thither, the queen heard of
young Gordon's fight and rebellion, and refuting, in the first
transports of her indignation, to enter under the father's roof, by
that fortunate expreflion of her resentment saved her ministers
from, unavoidable deftruetion .

On her arrival at Inivcrincl, the commanding onliccr in tle caflle,
by HIuntly's orders, fliut the gates against her. Mary was obliged
to lodge in the town, which was open and dcfencelcls ; but this
too was quickly flrrounded by a multitude of the earl's followers o.
The utmnolt conflternation seized the queen, who was attcnded by
a very slender train. She every momentt expeQced the approach
of the rebels, and tbnme flips were already ordered into the river
to secure her cfcape. The loyalty of tlie Monrocs, Frazers,
Tlacl;inLtofhes, and ibmei neighbouring clans, lwho took arms in
licr defence, aved lier fiom this danger. By tclr afliflance, lile
even forced tie caffle to iurrelldcr, and inflicted on the governoir
tlic punifliment which his iniolciece dcfcrvced.

Tiiis open a&t of difobedienee was the occasion of a measure

more galling to Hluntly than any the queen had hitherto taken.
Lord Erlfkine having pretendd(l a right to the earlldom of Mar,
Stewart rcfigned it in his favour; and at the fanm time Iniary con-
ferred upon him the title of earl of MI/Iurray, with the eilate an-
nexed to that dignity, which had been in the poltcilon of the carl
of H-untly since the year I54F8 . From this encroachment upon his
domains he concluded that his family was devoted to deltirucion;
and dreading to be flripped gradually of those poiisiTions which, il
reward of their services, the gratitude of the crown had be!lowed on
himself, or his anceflors, he no longer dilguifed his intentions, but,

Before they recovered from the confusion occasioncd by this unl- 3B 0 o T
foreiecn rcfiftance, those who had begun the flight, willing to ----
regain tlleir credit with the vitorious party, fell upon them, and
completed the rout. I-untly himself, who was extremely corpu-
lent, was trodden to death in the pursuit. His soris, fir John
and Adam, were taken, and Murray returned in triumlph to Aber-
deen with his prisoners.

TIE trial of men taken in actual rebellion againfl their fovcreigbn

was extremely short. Three days after the battle, fir John Gor-
don was beheaded at Aberdeen. His brother Adam was pardoned
on account of his youth. Lord Gordon, who had been privy to
his father's designs, vwas fcized in the south, and upon trial found
guilty of treason ; but, through the queen's clemency, the punish-
ment was remitted. The first parliament proceeded againlnf this
great family with the utmoil rigour of law, and reduced their
power and fortune to the lowefli ebb .

As

k This conspiracy of the catl of Huntly is one of the most intricate andl myflcrioius

paflages in the Scottish hifiory. As it was a tranfai:ion purely domeffic, and in
which the English were little intereflcd, few original papers concerning it have
been found in Cecil's Collection, the great ftorchoiul of evidence and information
with regard to the affairs of this period.

Buchanan supposes Mary to have formed a design about this time of deftroyiing

Murray, and of employing the power of the earl of H-untly for this purpose. 13utl
his account of this whole tranifarion appears to be so void of truth, and even of pro-
bability, as to deserve no serious examination. At that time MIary wanted power,
and leems to have had no inclination to commit any adt of violence upon her
brother.

Two other hypothefcs have been advanced, in order to explain this matter; but
they appear to be equally removed from truth.

I. It cannot well be conceived, that the queen's journey to the north was a scheme

concerted by \Murray, in order to ruin the earl of Huntly. r. Huntly had resided
at court almost ever since the queen's return. Keith, 198. Append. 175, &c.

this year, it would have been improper to interrupt the narrative
i5 ó' by taking notice of lesSer tranfaQ ions, which may now be related

with equal propriety.

This was the proper place in which to have seized him. To attack him in Aberdeen-
lhire, the feat of his power, and in the midfl of his vafials, was a projec equally
absurd and hazardous. 2. The queen was not accompanied with a body of troops,
capable ofattempting any thing against luntly by violence; her train was not more
numerous than was usual in times of greatcft tranquillity. Keith, 230. 3. There
remain two original letters with regard to this conspiracy, one from Rando!ph the
English resident, and another from Maitland, both directed to Cecil. They talk
of Huntly's mcafures as notoriously trcafonable. Randolph mrentions his repeated
attempts to afnliffnate Murray, &c. No hint is given of any previous resolution;
formed by IMary's miniftcrs, to ruin Huntly and his family. Ilad any such defigQ
ever existed, it was Randolph's duty to have discovered it; nor would Maitland
have laboured to conceal it from the English secretary. IKeith, 229. 232.

II. To fuppofu that- the carl of Huntly had laid any plan for-feizing the queen and

her ministers, seems to be no lets improbable. i. On the queen's arrival in the
north, he laboured, in good earnefr, to gain her favour, and to obtain a pardon
for his son. Knox, 318. 2. He met the queen, firfl at Aberdeen, and then at
Rothemay, whither he would not have ventured to cone, had he harboured aly
such treasonable resolution. Knox, 318. 3,. His conduct was irrcfolute and
wavering, like that of a man disconcerted by an unforeseen danger, not like one
executing a concerted plan. 4. The most considerable perlbns of his clan tlb-.
mitted to the queen, and found surety to obey her commands. Keith, 226. Had
the earl. bten previously determined to rife in arms against the queen, or to Icize
her miniflers, it is probable he would have imparted it to his principal followers,
nor would they have deserted himn in this manner.

For these reafors we have, on the one hand, vindicated the earl of AMurray

from any deliberate intention of ruining the family of Gordon ; nnd on the other
hand, we have imputed the violent conduct of the earl of Huntly to a sudden start-
of' relcntmlent, without charging hinl with any premeditated purpofc of rebcllion.

not be rejeeted with decency, the time, the place, and the cir- B o0 KI
cumftances of the meeting, were inflantly agreed upon. But Eli- -
zabeth was prudent enough not to admit into her kingdom a
rival who outshon.e herlclf so far in beauty and gracefulness of
person ; and who excelled so eminently in all the arts of infinu-
ation and address. Under pretence of being confined to London,
by the attention which she was obliged to give to the civil wars
in IFrance, flhe put off the interview for that itafon ', and pre-
vented her subjects from feeing the Scottifli queen, the charms of
whose appearance and behaviour flhe. envied, and had foImc reason

was presented to the queen; but without any cftccI-. There was
no reason to expca that Mary would discover any forlwardnefs to

TiirE sirs of these was the murder of her uncle the duke of

Guise. The violence and ambition of that nobleman had in-
volved his country in a civil war; which was conducted with
furious animiofity and various success. At la-st tie duke laid
Ilege to Orleans, the bulwark of thle protestant cause; and he
had reduced tlat city to the last extremity, when he was
aflhffinated by the frantic zeal of Poltrot. This blow proved fatal
to the quecn of Scots. Tlhe young duke was a minor; and the
cardinal of Lorrain, though lubtle and intriguing, wanted that
undaunted and cnterpriinlg courage, which rendered the ambition
of hllis brother so formidable. Cathcrine, inilead of cncouraging
the ambition, or furthering the pretensions, of her daughter-in-law,
took pleailre in mortifying the one, and in dialppointing tile other.
In this fittation, and without fucli a protector, it became necefl'ry
for MIary to contract her views, and to proceed with caution; and

lwhatcver prospect of advantage might allure her, flie could ven-

ture upon no dangerous or doubtful measure.

Tla views of TIIE fccolnd circumnfance which weighed wnith Mary, was the

queen interciled Ilizabeth more deeply than any othcir prince;

future with the utmofi care. As the reftleis ambition of the _-_---
Austrian princes, tle avowed and bigoted patrons of the catholic 563
superstition, made her, in a particular manner, dread their neigh-
bourhood, she inflrul:ed Randolph to remonstrate, in the strongest
terms, against any alliance with them; and to acquaint Mary,
that as flc herlelf would confider such a match to be a breach of
the personal friendfuip, in which they were so happily united;
so the EngliflT nation would regard it as the dissolution of that
confederacy which now subsisted between the two kingdoms:
that, in order to preserve their own religion and liberties, they
would, in all probability, take obme ftep prejudicial to her right of
succession, which, as ihe well knew, they neither wanted power
nor pretences to invalidate and set aside. This threatening was
accompanied with a promise, but exprefed in very ambiguous
terms, that if Mary's choice of a husband should prove agreeable
to the Englifl nation, Elizabeth would appoint proper persons to
examine her title to the succession, and, if well founded, com-
mand it to be publicly recognised. She observed, however, a
mysterious silence concerning the person on whom The wiflcd

queen. But, under her present circumstances, she was obliged
to bear this indignity. Destitute of all foreign assistance, and intent

The senti- TIIE inclination of her own fubjets was another, and not the
ments of her
own fubjets. leafi considerable circumstance, which called for Mary's attention

at this conjuncture. They had been taught, by the fatal experi-
ment of her former marriage, to dread an union with any great
prince, whose power might be employed to oppress their religion
and liberties. They trembled at the thoughts of a match with a
foreigner; and if the crown should be strengthened by new do-
minions or alliances, they foresaw that the royal prerogative would
soon be firetched beyond its ancient and legal limits. Their eager-
ness to prevent this could hardly fail of throwing them once more
into the arms of England. Elizabeth would be ready to afford
them her aid towards obftruding a measure so disagreeable to
herself. It was easy for them to seize the person of the sovereign.
By the aiftance of the Englifli fleet, they could render it difficult
for any foreign prince to land in Scotland. The Roman catholics,
now an inconsiderable party in the kingdom, and dispirited by the
loss of the earl of Huntly, could give no ohftrusion to their designs.
To what violent extremes the national abhorrence of a foreign yoke
might have been carried, is manifest from what the had already
seen and experienced.

FOR these reasons Mary laid aside, at that time, all thoughts of

foreign alliance, and seemed willing to sacrifice her own ambition,
in order to remove the jealousies of Elizabeth, and to quiet the
fears of her own fubjeds.

A parliament T-IE parliament met this year, for the first time since the
hedayz. *queen's return into Scotland. Mary's adminicfration had hitherto

been

been extremely popular. Her miniflers poffelfed the confidence B O IC
of the nation; and, by consequence, the proceedings of that *-- --
assembly were condulted with perfec unanimity. The grant of the 63
earldom of Murray to the prior of St. Andrew's was confirmed:
the earl of I-untly, and several of his vafltls and dependants,
were attainted: the attainder against Kirkaldy of Crange, and
some of his accomplices in the murder of cardinal Beatoun, was
reversed : the aa of oblivion, mentioned in the treaty of Edin-
burgh, received the royal fanaion. But Mary, who had deter-
mined never to ratify that treaty, took care that this ianrion
should not be deemed ahy acknowledgment of its validity; fle
granted her content merely in condescension to the lords in par-
liament, who, on their knees, besought her to allay the jealousies
and apprehensions of her fubjeds, by such a gracious law .

No attempt was made, in this parliament, to procure the queen's Nothing de-.

assent to the laws eftablithing the proteflant religion. Her mini- wthernerdt
fiers, though zealous protestants tlhenfelves, were aware that this rcligion"
could not be urged without manifest danger and imprudence. She
had consented, through their influence, to tolerate and protect the
reformed doctrine. They had even prevailed on her to inlprifon
and prolecute the archbishop of St. Andrew's, and prior of WhVit-
horn, for celebrating mass contrary to her proclamation'. Mary,
however, was fiill paflionately devoted to the Romifli church; and
though, from political motives, fle had granted a temporary
proteCtion of opinions which lle diSipproved, there were no
grounds to hope that Ihe would agree to establish them for
perpetuity. The moderation of thol`e who professed it, was the
best method for reconciling the queen to the protestant religion.

Many laws of importance were to be proposed in parliament;
and to defeat all these, by such a fruitless and ill-timed application
to the queen, would have been equally injurious to individuals,
and detrimental to the public.
which offends THE zeal of the protestant clergy was deaf to all these confider--

e ations of policy. Eager and impatient, it brooked no delay:

severe and inflexible, it would condescend to no compliances.
The leading men of that order insisted, that this opportunity of
establishing religion by law, was not to be neglecded. They pro-
nounced the moderation of the courtiers, apoitacy; and their en-
deavours to gain the queen, they reckoned criminal and fervileo
Knox solemnly renounced the friendfhip'of the earl of Murray, as

to become regardless of those objeEts which he had hitherto esteemed

sincere attachment to the queen at that period, continued above a.
year and an half".

THE- preachers being disappointed by the men in whom they

placed the greatest confidence, gave vent to their indignation in
their, pulpits. These echoed more loudly than ever, with decla-

first overture of a match with a fubje&. Her own rank, the
splendour of her former marriage, and the solicitations at this time
of so many powerful princes, crowded into her thoughts, and
made her sensibly feel how humbling and difrefpeElful Elizabeth's
proposal was. She dissembled, however, with the English refl-
dent; and though she declared, in strong terms, what a degra-
dation she would deem this alliance, which brought along with it
no advantage that could justify such neglect of her own dignity,
lhe mentioned the earl of Leicester, notwithstanding, in terms full
of rcfpel n.

Elizabeth's ELIZABETH, we may presume, did not with that the proposal
conmencding fliould be received in any other manner. After the extraordinary
him. marks ihe had given of her own attachment to Leicester, and while

he was still in the very height of favour, it is not probable lihe
could think seriously of beflowing him upon another. It was not
her aim to persuade, but only to amuse Mary". Almost three
years were clapsed since her return into Scotland; and though
solicited by her fubjecds, and courted by the greatefl princes in
Europe, she had hitherto been prevented from marrying, chiefly by
the artifices of Elizabeth. If at this time the English queen could
have engaged Mary to liflen to her proposal in favour of Leicefler,
her power over this creature of her own would have enabled her
to protrat the ncgociation at plcaiurce; and by keeping her rival

LrICESTER'S own situation was extremely delicate and embar-

raffing. To gain poffefilon of the most amiable woman of the
age, to carry away this prize from so many contending princes, to
mount the throne of an ancient kingdomn, might have flattered
the ambition of a fubjca much more confidcrable than him. He
saw all these advantages, no doubt; and, in fccrct, they made
their full impreflion on him. But, without offending Elizabeth,
he durst not venture on the molt distant difcovcry of his senti-
ments, or take any ftep towards facilitating his acquisition of ob-
jcets so worthy of desire.

ON the other hand, Elizabeth's partiality towards him, which

she was at no pains to conceal ', might inf)ire him with hopes of
attaining the supreme rank in a kingdom more illustrious than
Scotland. Elizabeth had often declared that nothing but her refo-
lution to lead a single life, and his being born her own fiubjea,
would have hindered her from chufing the earl of Lcicefler for a
husband. Such considerations of prudence are, however, often
surmounted by love; and Leicester might flatter himself, that
the violence of her affection would at length triumph both
over the maxims of policy and the scruples of pride. Tefce
hopes induced him, now and then, to conclude the propofll of
his marriage with the Scottish queen to be a project for his defRruc-
tion; and he imputed it to the malice of Cecil, who, under the
specious pretence of doing him honour, intended to ruin him in tle
good opinion both of Elizabeth and Mary '.

1 64. against it; and scarcely desired by the man himself, whose interest

and reputation it was calculated, in appearance, to promote
could not, under so many unfavourable circumstances, be brought
to a fortunate issue. Both Elizabeth and Mary continued, how-
ever, to act with equal difimulation. The former, notwithftand-
ing her fears of losing Leicester, solicited warmly in his behalf.
The latter, though fle began about this time to cast her eyes upon
another fubjc:c of England, did not at once venture finally to reject
Elizabeth's favourite.

Mary entcr- T-HE person towards whom Mary began to turn her thoughts,
tainsthoughts
of mnrrying was Henry Stewart lord Darnly, eldest son of the earl of Lennox,
ord Darnly. That nobleman, having been driven out of Scotland under the

regency of the duke of Chatelherault, had lived in banifhlment for
twenty years, His wife, lady Margaret Douglas, was Mary's moot
dangerous rival in her claim upon the Engiifhs fucceflion. Sle
was the daughter of Margaret, the eldeRl sifter of Henry VIII. by
the earl of Angus, whom that queen married after the death of
her husband James IV. In that age, the right and order o f
succession was not fettled with the fame accuracy as at present.
Time, and the decision of almost every cafe that can possibly
happen, have at last introduced certainty into a matter, whicl
naturally is Iubjedt to all the variety arising from the caprice c
lawyers, guided by obscure, and often imaginary analogies. Tlic
countess of Lennox, though born of a second marriage, was one
degree nearer the royal blood of England than PMary. She was
the daughter, Mary only the grand-daughter, of Margaret. This
was not the only advantage over Mlary which the countess of
Lennox enjoyed. She was born in England, and by a maxim of

law

iaw in tiat country, with regard to private inheritances, " who- B o

o

ever is not Lborll in IEngland, or at leant of parents who, at thie -----_
time of his birth, were in tle obedience of the king of England, 564
cannot enjoy any inheritance in the kingdom '." This maxim,
Hales, an Englif lawyer, pro(duced in a trcaiic which he pub-
lijled at this time, and endeavoured to apply it to the right of
succession to the crown. In a private cauic, thele pretexts might
have given rife to a long and doubtful litigation ; where a crown.
was at flake, such nice diiputes and subtiltics were to be avoided
with the utmost care. If Darnly ihould happen to contraa an
alliance with any of the powerful families in England, or should
publicly profess the protcltant religion, tllcec plaulible and popular
topics might be so urged, as to prove fatal to the pretensions of a
foreigner and of a papist.

MArRY was aware of all this; and, in order to prevent any

danger from that quarter, had early endeavoured to cultivate a
friendly correspondence with the family of Lcnnox. In the year
one thousand five hundred and fixty-tw o % botll the carl and the
lady Margaret were taken into custody by Elizabeth's orders, on
account of their holding a secret corrcfpondencc with the Scottifil
queen.

FROM the time that Mary became sensible of the difficulties Elizabeth e-

cretly pleated

which would attend her marrying a foreign prince, fil entered citlYhis
into a still closer connexion with the earl of Lcnnox ", and invited
him to return into Scotland. This ie endeavourcd to conceal
from Elizabeth; but a tranfadion of so much importance did nor
escape the notice of that discerning princcfs. She obfervcdl, but

Bo o K did not interrupt it. Nothing could fall in more perfelly with

IIl.
t.i.- ., her views concerning Scottish affairs. She was pleased to fee the

1564. pride of the Scottish queen sloop at last to the thoughts of taking

a subjed to her bed. Darnly was in no situation to excite her
jealousy or her fears. His father's estate lay in England, and by
means of this pledge she hoped to keep the negociation entirely
in her own hands, to play the fame game of artifice and delay,
which she had planned out, if her recommendation of Leicester
had been more favourably received.

As before the union of the two crowns, no subjec of one king-

dom could pass into the other without the permiflion of both so-
vereigns; no sooner did Lennox, under pretence of prosecuting
his wife's claim upon the earldom of Angus, apply to Elizabeth
for her licence to go into Scotland, than he obtained it. To-
gether with it, flie gave him letters, warmly recommending his
person and cause to Mary's friendship and protection °. But at the
fame time, as it was her manner to involve all her tranfaaions
with regard to Scotland in some degree of perplexity and contra-
diction; she warned Mary, that this indulgence of Lennox might
prove fatal to herfcif, as his return could not fail of reviving the.
ancient animosity between him and the house of Hamilton.

Ti-s admonition gave umbrage to Mary, and drew from her

an angry reply, which occasioned for some time a total interruption
of all correspondence between the two queens P. Mary was not a
little alarmed at this; the both dreaded the effecs of Elizabeth's
resentment, and felt sensibly the disadvantage of being excluded
from a free intercourse with England, where her ambaflidors had. J

increased tile number of her partilans, and paved her way towards ---
the throne. In order to remove the causes of the present dif-
siculty, Mlelvil was sent express to the court of England. II
found it no difficult matter to bring about a reconcilement; and
ibon re-established the appcarance, but not the confilence of fiicnd-
ship, which was all that had subsisted for some lime between the
two queens.

DURING this negociation, Elizabeth's profeflions of love to

Mary, and Melvil's replies in the name of his miitrefs, were made
in the language of the warmest and most cordial friendlhip. But
what Melvil truly olfcrves with refpea to Elizabeth, may be ex-
tended, without injustice, to both queens. " There was neither
plain dealing, nor upright meaning, but great diflimulation, cnvy,
and fear '."

LENNOX, however, in consequence of' the licence which lie Lcnnoxar-

had obtained, set out foi Scotland, and was rcceivcd by the queen, ivC in SCO:
not only with the refpc& due to a nobleman so nearly allied to the
royal family, but treated with a diftinguiflcd familiarity which
could not fail of inspiring him with more elevated hopes. The

TIIE powerful family of Douglas no less dreaded Lennox's re-

turn, from an apprehension that he would wrest the earldom of
Angus out of their hands. But the queen, who well knew how
dangerous it would be to irritate Morton, and other great men of
that name, prevailed on Lcnnox to purchase their friendship, by
allowing his lady's claimi upon the earldom of Angus to drop 5.

The genius of that superstition, averse at all times from tole-
ration, was in that age fierce and unrelenting. Mary had given
her friends on the continent repeated assurances of her rceolution

five hundred and sixty, in favour of the Rcformatioi. E'ven the
proteclion which, cver since her return, she had aflbrded the pro-
teflant religion, was merely temporary, and declared, by her own
proclamation, to be of force only " till she fhouild take Iome final
order in the matter of religionY." The vigilant zeal of the
preachers was inattentive to none of these circumst:ances. The
coldness of their principal leaders, who were at this tine entirely
devoted to the court, added to their jcaloufies and fears. Thcel
they uttered to the people, in language which they dccmced suitable
to the necessity of the times, and which the queen reckoned dif-
recpeCtful and insolent. In a meeting of the general afinimbly,
Maitland publicly accused Knox of teaching ficditious doctrinc.
concerning the right of fubjecLs to reilft those fovereigs who tref-
pass against the duty which they owe to the people. Knox was not
backward to justify what he had taught; and upon this general
doctrine of refiflance, so just in its own nature, but so delicate ill
its application to particular caies, there ensued a debate, which
admirably difp!ays the talents and chara cr of both the dilputants;

The was ready to yield to the solicitations of his mistress in behalf
of Leicester a. Nothing could be farther than this from the mind
and intention of Elizabeth. The right of succession was a imyftery,
which, during her whole reign, her jealousy preserved untouched
and unexplained. She had promised, however, when she first
began to interest herself in the marriage of the Scottish queen, all
that was now demanded. How to retreat with decency, how
to elude her former offer, was, on that account, not a little
perplexing.

THEi facility with which lord Darnly obtained permifilon to

visit the court of Scotland, was owing, in all probability, to that
embarrafiment. From the time of Melvil's embassy, the countess
of Lennox had warmly solicited this liberty for her son. Elizabeth
was no firanger to the ambitious hopes with which that young
nobleman flattered himself. She had received repeated advices
from her ministers of the sentiments which Mary began to enter-
tain in his favour ". It was entirely in her power to prevent his
flirring out of London. In the present conjuncture, however,
nothing could be of more advantage to her than Darnly's journey
into Scotland. She had already brought one aQor upon the stage,
who, under her management, had, for a long time, amuscd the
Scottiffi queen. She hoped, no less absolutely, to direcl the
motions of Darnly, who was likewise her subject; and again to
involve Mary in all the tedious intricacies of negociation. These
motives determined Elizabeth and her ministers to yield to the soli-
citations of the countess of Lennox.

BUT

BUT this deep-laid scheme was in a moment disconcerted. Such B 0 0 K

11i.

unexpeaed events, as the fancy of poets ascribes to love, are at fonme
times really produced by that paflion. An aflair which had been Darnly ar-

rives in Scot-

the objecl of so many political intrigues, and had moved and inte- land.
refted so many princes, was at last decided by the sudden liking of
two young persons. Lord Darnly was at this time in tle firfl
bloom and vigour of youth. In beauty and gracefulness of person
he fiirpafled all his cotemnporaries; he excelled eminently in fucl
arts as add ease and elegance to external form, and which enable it
not only to dazzle, but to please. Mary was of an age, and of a CGains the
temper, to feel the full sower of these accomplishments. The
impreflion which lord Darnly made upon her was visible from the
time of their first interview. The whole business of the court was Feb. T3.
to amuse and entertain this illustrious guest ; and in all those
scenes of gaiety, Darnly, wllofe qualifications were altogether fu-
perficial and ihowy, appeared to great advantage. His conquest
of the queen's heart became complete; and inclination now
prompted her to concludie a marriage, the first thoughts of which
had been suggested by confidcrations merely political.

ELIZABETHI contributed, and perhaps not without design, to

increase the violence of this paflion. Soon after Darnly's arrival
in Scotland, she, in return to that mefcage whereby Mary had
significd her willingneis to accept of LeicePfer, gave an answer, in
such terms as plainly unravelled her original intention in that in-
trigue d. She promised, if the Scottifl queen's marriage with
Leicester flould take place, to advance him to great honours; but
withl regard to Mary's title to the Englifhll icceffion, she would
neither susser any legal inquiry to be made concerning it, nor

in this reply; her high iirit, lhowever, could not bear with pa-
tience fich a cruel discovery of the contempt, the artifice, and
mockery, with which, under the veil of fiienldflip, lhe had been
so long abused. She burti into tears of indignation, and exprefled,
with the utmolf bittcrne4's, her sense of that dililgcnuous crafe
which had been employed to deceive her c

of this indignation was to add to the impe-

whom fle had chosen; and began to ta!e the nccefilay steps to-
wards accomplilhing her design, with all tle impatience natural to
those paiflons.

As Darnly was so nearly related to the queen, the canon law

made it neceIfary to obtain the pope's dilpenfthtion before the cele-
bration of the marriage. For this purpose ilce early Jet on foot a
negociation with the court of Rome .

The French S-l E was busy, at the r-ame time, in procuring the consent of
Cofthe matcjP the French king and his mother. -Haing communicated her de-

sign, and the motives which determined her choice, to Caltelnau
the French ambaflador, the employed him, as the most proper
person, to bring his court to fall in with her views. Among other
arguments to this purpose, Caftelnau mentioned Mary's attachment
to Darnly, which he reprefcnted to be so violent and deep-rooted,

Nor were the French minifllers backward in encouraging Mary's *.-.-

measure which flhe had io much at heart; Darnly and his father, ot lthi noblc,.
by their behaviour, were railing up enemies at home to obfiriu
it. Lennox had, during the former part of his life, difiovered
no great comrpafs of abilities or political wisdom ; and appears to
hlave been a man of a wealk underflanding and violent paflions.
Darnly was not fupcrior to his father in understanding, and all his
passions were frill more impetuous .' To thfc l he added that info-
lence, which the advantage of external f)mr, when accompanied
with no quality more valuable, is apt to infpirc. Intoxicated with
the queen's favour, lie began already to aflume the haughtiness of
a king, and to put on that imperious air, which majesty itielf can
scarce render tolerable.

IT was by the advice, or at least with the content, of Murray particularly

and his party, tlhat Lennox had been invited into Scotland ; and Murray.
vet, no sooner did he acquire a firm footing in that kingdom, than
lie began to enter into fecrct cabals with those noblemen who were
known to be avowed enemies to Murray, and, with regard to
religion, to be either neutrals or favourers of popery . Darnly,

B O 0 K still more imprudent, allowed some rash expreflions concerning
_-----_ those favours which the queen's bounty had conferred upon Mur-

i565- ray, to escape him .

BUT, above all these, the familiarity which Darnly cultivated

with David Rizio, contributed to incrcaef the suspicion and dif-
gust of the nobles.

The rlfeof TIHE low birth and indigent condition of this man placed him
Rizio's fa-
vour. in a itation in which he ought naturally to have remained unknown

to posterity. But what fortune called him to at and to susser in
Scotland, obliges history to dcfcend from its dignity, and to record
his adventures. He was the son of a musician in Turin, and
having accompanied the Piedmontefe ambassador into Scotland,
gained admission into the queen's family by his flill in music. As
his dependant condition had taught him ifupplenefs of spirit and
insinuating manners, he quickly crept into the queen's favour, and
her French secretary happening to return at that time into his own
country, was preferred by her to that office. I-I now began to
make a figure in court, and to appear as a man of consequence.
The whole train of suitors and expedants, who have an extreme
sagacity in dilcovering the paths which lead most directly to fuc-
cess, applied to him. His recommendations were observed to
have great influence over the queen, and he grew to be confidered
not only as a favourite, but as a miniRer. Nor was Rizio careful
to abate that envy which always attends such an extraordinary and
rapid change of fortune. He studied, on the contrary, to display
the whole extent of his favour. He affected to talk often and
familiarly with the queen in public. He equalled the greatest and

mofl opulent ful)jecs, in richness of dress, and in the number of B °l0 K
his attendants. He discovered, in all his behaviour, that assuming -----
infolcnce, with which unmerited protiperity inspires an ignoble
mind. It was with the utmost indignation that the nobles beheld
the power; it was x ith the utmof: difficulty that they tolerated
the arrogance, of this unworthy minion. Even in the queen's prc-
fence they could not forbear treating him with marks of con-
tempt. Nor was it his exorbitant power alone which cxatferated
the Scots. They conlidcred him, and not without rcafon, as a
dangcrous enemy to the protcftant religion, and fulpeaed that he
held, for this purpofc, a secret correfpondcnce with the court of
Rome m.

IT was Darnly's misfortune to fall under the management of Darnly'scon-

this man, wllo, by flattery and afiduity, eafiiy gained on his hi vl
vanity and unexperience. Rizio's whole influence on the queen
was employed in his behalf, and contributed, without doubt, to-
wards eflablifhing him more firmly in her affclions n. But what-
ever benefit Darnly might reap fiom his patronage, it did not
counterbalance the contempt, and even infamy, to which he was
exposed, on account of his fmliliarity witlh ich an uplart.

THOUGH Darnly daily made progress in the queen's affetions,

file conducted herself, however, with such prudent reserve, as to
impose on Randolph the English resident, a man otherwise shirewd
and penetrating. It appears from his letters at this period, that
he entertained not the least suspicion of the intrigue which was
carrying on; and gave his court repeated assurances, that the
Scottifl queen had no design of marrying Darnly0. In the midst

poffieced of lands in both kingdoms, could be formidable to neither.

lIl.
A---- sentiments of the nation were not different from her own. Not

long after, she confined the countess of Lennox as a prisoner, first
in her own house, and then sent her to the Towerr.

INTTELLIGENCE of all this reached Scotland before the arrival

of the English ambaf'ador. In the first transports of her indig-
nation, Mary resolved no longer to keep any measures with Eli-
zabeth; and sent orders to Maitland, who accompanied Throg-
morton, to return instantly to the English court, and in her name
to declare to Elizabeth, that after having been amused so long to
so little purpose; after having been fooled, and imposed on so
grossly by her artifices; fihe was now resolved to gratify her own
inclination, and to ask no other consent, but that of her own sub-
jeds, in the choice of an husband. Maitland, with his usual
sagacity, foresaw all the effeEts of such a rash and angry meflage,
and ventured.rather to incur the displeasure of his miflrefs, by dif-
obeying her commands, than to be made the initrument of tearing
asunder so violently the few remaining ties which Rill linked to-
gether the two queens .

MARY herself soon became sensible of her error. She received

the English ambassador with refpe& :; juflified her own conduc
with decency; and though unalterable in her rcfolution, she as-
fedted a wonderful solicitude to reconcile Elizabeth to the measure;
and even pretended, out of complaisance towards her, to put off the
consummation of the marriage for some months '. It is probable,
however, that the want of the pope's dispensation, and the pro-
spect of gaining the content of her own fubjecs, were the real
motives of this delay.

finate him, during the meeting of the Convention at Perth. IMur-
ray, on his part, del'airing of preventing the marriage by any
other means, had, together with the duke of Chl.aclhlcraul, audl
the earl of Argyll, concerted measures for seizing L'arnly, and
carrying him a prisoner intp England.

IF either of thcfe confpriracies had taken cflc t, this Convention

might have been attended worith confcqluences extremely tragical
but both were rendered abortive, by the vigilance or good oirtlne
of those againlt whom they were formed. lMurray, blinlg warned
of his danger by some retainers to the court, w'ho fiill fa vourcd
his interest, avoided the blow by not going to Perth. AM ary,
receiving intelligence of Murray's cntc-rprie, retired with the ut-
nmof expedition, along with Darnly, to the other fide of Forth.
Conscious, on both fides, of guilt, and inflamed with rcelntment, it
was impoiTible they could either forget the violence which them-
selves had meditated, or forgive the injuries intended against tlhcm.
From that moment all hope of reconcilement was at an end, and
their mutual enmity burst out with every fynmptom of implacable
hatred'.

The reality of there two oppoflte conspiracies has given occasion to many dif-

putes and much contradiEl'ion. Some deny that any design was formed againflt
the life of Murray; others call in queflion the truth of the conspiracy againhf
Darnly. There feemn, however, to be plausible reasons for believing that there
is some foundation for what has been afrerted with regard to both ; though the zeal
and credulity of party-writers have added to each many exaggerated circumflances.

B O O IK tle lords who adhered to him, were afilmbled at Stirling, to deli-

_ .- l berate what courfc they fiould hold in such a difficult conjunQture.

5 But the current of popular favour rall o flrongly againfi them,

and, notwithstanding some fears and jealousies, there prevailed in
the nation fucl a general disposition to gratify the queen in a
matter which so nearly concerncd her, that, without coming to
any other conclusion, than to implore the queen of England's pro-
teclion, they put an end to their inefceaual consultations, and
returned every man to his own house.

TOGErlIERt with this dilcovery of the weakness of her ene-

mies, the confluence of her fubjedts fiom all corners of the king-
dom afforded Mary an agreeable proof of her own firength.
WVhile the queen was in this prosperous situation, she deter-
mined to bring to a period an affair which had so long engrossed

Celcbrcate her heart- and occupied her attention. On the twenty-ninth of
her mnarringe
with ])arnly. July, lhe married lord Darnly. The ceremony was performed in

the queen's chapel, according to the rites of the Romifi church;
the pope's bull dispensing with their marriage having been pre-
vioufly obtained n'. She iffiued at the iiume time proclamations,
conferring the title of King of Scots upon her husband, and com-
manding that henceforth all writs at law flhould run in the joint
names of king and queen ". Nothing can be a stronger proof of the
violence of Mary's love, or the weakness of her councils, than this
last ftep. Whether fie had any right to chufe a husband without
content of parliament, was, in that age, a matter of some dif-
pute ; that flhe had no right to confer upon him, by her private
authority, the title and dignity of king, or by a simple procla-
mation to raile her lhufand to be the mailer of her people, fterms
to be beyond all doubt. Francis II. indeed, bore the fame title.

Keith, 307. ' Anderson, i. 33. See Append. No. XI. o Buclan. 341.

It

It was not, however, the gift of the queen, but of the nation; B O O I
and the content of parliament was obtained, before he ventured -.--.--
to aflume it. Darnly's condition, as a fuljedt, rendered it fill
more necessary to have the concurrence of the filprcme council in
his favour. Such a violent and unprecedented firetch of prerc-
gative, as the substituting a proclamation in place of an act of
parliament, might have justly alarmed the nation. lBut at that
time the queen pofleffed so entirely the confidence of her fuijeds,
that, notwithstanding all the clamours of the malecolntents, no
symptoms of general discontent appeared on that account.

EVEN amidst that scene of joy which always accompanies fitc-

cefsful love, Mary did not susser the course of her vcngeance
againit the malecontent nobles to be interrupted. Three days
after the marriage, Murray was again fuimmoned to court, under
the severest penalties, and upon his non-appearance the rigour of
justice took place, and he was declared an out-law . At tlc liame
time the queen set at liberty lord Gordon, who, ever fincc his
father's infurretion in the year one thousand five hundred and
fixty-two, had been detained a prisoner; she recalled the carl of
Sutherland, who, on account of his concern in that collfiiracy, lihad
fled into Slanders; and the permitted Botllwell to return again
into Scotland. The first and last of these were among the moflt
powerful fubjeds in the kingdom, and all of them animated with
implacable hatred to Murray, whom they deemed the enemy
of their families and the author of their own fiffeings. Thlis
common hatred became the foundation of the flricteft union with
the queen, and gained them an ascendant over all her councils.
Murray himself confidered this confederacy with his avowed enc-

make head againfl the numerous forces which Alary had affenblcd;
and fled into Argylefhire, in expecation of aid fiom Elizabeth,
to whom they had secretly dispatched a mnclenger, in order to
implore her immediate afliflance .

E:izibcth in- MEANWIILE, Elizabeth endeavoured to cmbarrafs Mary, by
terpofes in
their flvour, a newlrC declaration of disgust at her conduc-. She blamed both her

choice of lord Darnly, and the precipitation with which lhe had
concluded the marriage. She required Lcnnox and Darnly, whom
fle still called her subjeCts, to return into England ; and at the
fame time fihe warmly interceded in behalf of Murray, whose
behaviour flle represented to be not only innocent but laudable.
This message, so mortifying to the pride of the queen, and so full
of contempt for her husband, was rendered still more infup-
portable by the petulant and saucy demcanour of Tanmworth, the
person who delivered it'. Mary vindicated her own condudt with
warmth, but with great strength of reason; and rejected the in-
terceflion in behalf of Murray, not without signs of resentment

'i After their fruitless consultation in Stirling, the lords retired to their own houses.

in tranquillity, she, with an army eighteen thousand firong,
marched towards Dumfries, where the rebels then were. During
their retreat, they had sent letters to the queen, from almost every
place where they halted, full of fubmiflion, and containing various
overtures towards an accommodation. But Mary, who deter-
mined not to let flip such a favourable opportunity of crushing the
mutinous spirit of her fubjeds, rejeced them with disdain. As
the advanced, the malecontents retired. And, having received no
effectual aid from Elizabethb, they despaired of any other means

teclion of the earl of Bedford, warden of the marches.

They meet NOTHING, which Bedford's personal friendhiip for Murray
wvith unex-

frm Elizat Elizabeth herself treated them with extreme neglect. She had
beth. fully gained her end, and, by their means, had excited filch discord

and jealousies among the Scots, as would, in all probability, long
difiraat and weaken Mary's councils. Her business now was to
save appearances, and to justify herself to the ministers of France
and Spain, who accused her of fomenting the troubles in Scotland
by her intrigues. The expedient she contrived-for her vindication
strongly displays her own character, and the wretched condition of
exiles, who are obliged to depend on a foreign prince. Murray

her promises, and in order to forward her designs, had hazarded C 2 o xK
their lives and fortunes, could not even obtain the favour of an t--
audience, until they had meanly consented to acknowledge, in the
presence of the French and Spanifl ambafTadors, that Elizabeth
had given them no encouragement to take arms. No fooncr did
they make this declaration, than The aftoniflled them with this
reply: " You have declared the truth; I am far from eitting an
example of rebellion to my own subjects, by countenancing those
'who rebel against their lawful prince. The trcafon, of which you
have been guilty, is detestable; and as traitors I banilh you from
my prefencec." Notwithstanding tllis scene of farce and offalfe-
hood,. so diflonourable to all the persons who a&ed a part in it,
Elizabeth permitted the malecontents peaceably to reside in lier
dominions, supplied them secretly with money, and renewed her
interceflion with the Scottifll queen in their favour ".

TrE advantage she had gained over them did not l'atisfy Mary;

the rcfolved to follow the blow, and to prevent a party, which fimc
dreaded, from ever recovering any footing in the nation. With
this view ime called a meeting of parliament; and in order that

followed his superior, and the superior attended the monarch,
at his own expence. Six hundred horlemen, however, and three
companies of foot, besides her guards, received regular pay from
the queen. This extraordinary charge, together with the de-
burfements occasioned by her marriage, cxhaufted a treasury which
was far from being rich. In this exigency, many devices were
fallen upon for raising money. Fines were levied on the towns
of St. Andrew's, Perth, and Dundee, which were futlpeed of
favouring the malecontcnts. An unusual tax was imposed on the
boroughs throughout the kingdom ; and a great fulm was demanded
of the citizens of Edinburgh, by way of loan. This unprece-
dented exacion alarmed the citizens. They had recourse to de-
lays, and flarted diflicultics in order to evade it. Thce Mlary

several of the malecontent nobles were pricfint, and seem to have ° K
had great influence on its dccilions. Tile high firain in which '-----.
the assembly addressed tile queen, can be imputed only to tihofe
fears and jealoulles with regard to religion, which they endea-
voured to infule into the nation. The airecnbly complained, with
folnc bittcrnefs, of the flop which had been put to the progrcif of
the Reformation by the queen's arrival in Scotland l; they required
not only the total fuppreclion of the popill worfi-i throughout the
kingdom, but even in the queen's own chapel ; and betides the legal
eftablifhmcnt of the protestant religion, they (lemandetl that IlMary
herself ihould publicly cmurace it. The queen, after ioine dlli-
beration, replied, that neither her conscience nor her intcrell would
permit her to take fucl a Rfcp. The former would for ever re-
proach her for a change which proceeded from no inward con-
viaion, the latter would fufler by the offence which her apoftacy
must give to the king, of France, and her other allies on the
continent '.

IT is remarkable, that the prof)crous situation of the queen's

affairs during this year, began to work some change in favour of
her religion. Tle carls of Lcnnox, Athol, and Calils, openly

S the day appointed for the meeting of parliament ap- B o o ;.
proached, Mary and her iniftcrs were employed in dc- lV

liberating concerning the course which it was moist propcr to hold Mi,' de66i-
'with regard to the exiled nobles. Many motives prompted her to berations

concerning
let no bounds to the rigour of justice. The malecontents had theexiledno-

bles.

laboured to defeat a scheme, which her intcrcft conspired with her
paflions in rendering dear to her; they were the leaders of a
party, whole friendship the had been obliged to court, vwhile ihe
held their principles in abhorrence; and they were firmly attached
to a rival, whom she had good reason both to fear and to hate.

BUT, on the other hand, several weighty considerations might

IN those circumflances, an ad of clemency swould exalt the

queen's character, and appear no less splendid arong foreigners,
than acceptable to her own fubjeds. Mary hcrfelf, though highly
incensed, was not inexorable; but the king's rage was implacable

from various quarters. Morton, Ruthven, Maitland, and all who
had Leen members of the Congregation, were not forgetful of their
ancient union with Murray and llis fcilow-fufferers; nor negledful
of their fiifety, which they deemed of great importance to the
kingdom. Melvil, who at that time poffelfed the queen's con-
fidence, seconded their solicitations. And Murray having stooped
so low as to court Rizio, that favourite, who was desirous of fe-
curing his protection against the king, whose displeasure he had
lately incurred, seconded the intercessions of his other friends with
the whole of his influence . The interposition of fir Nicholas
Throgmorton, who had lately been Elizabeth's ambassador in Scot-
land, in behalf of the exiles, was of more weight than all there,
and attended with more success. Throgmorton, out of enmity to
Cecil, had embarked deeply in all the intrigues which were carried
on at the English court, in order to undermine the power and
credit of that minifler. I-Ie espoused, for this reason, the cause
of the Scottish queen, towards whose title and pretensions the other
was known to bear little favour; and ventured, in the prefcnt
critical junCture, to write a letter to Mary, containing the mofl
salutary advices with regard to her conduc. He recommended
the pardoning of the earl of Murray and his associates, as a

AN interview between Charles IX. and his fifler the queen of

Spain had been often proposed; and after many obstacles, arising
from the opposition of political interest, was at last appointed at
Bayonne. Catherine of Medicis accompanied her son; the duke
of Alva attended his miflrefs. Amidst the scenes of public pomp
and pleasure, which leemed to be the sole occupation of both
courts, a scheme was formed, and measures concerted, for exter-
minating the I-Iugonots in France, the Protestants in the Low
Countries, and for suppressing the Reformation throughout all
Europe f. The ative policy of pope Pius IV. and the zeal of the
cardinal of Lorrain, confirmed and encouraged dispositions so suit-
able to the genius of the Romish religion, and so beneficial to their
own order.

IT was an account of this holy league which the second French

envoy brought to Mary, conjuring her at the fame time, in the
name of the king of France and the cardinal of Lorrain, not to
restore the leaders of the protestants in her kingdom to power and
favour, at the very time when the catholic princes were combined
to destroy that ifet in all the countries of Europe g.

POPERY is a species of false religion, remarkable for the strong

poffefiion it takes of the heart. Contrived by men of deep infight
in the human character, and improved by the experience and
obfcrvation of many successive ages; it arrived at last to a degree
of perfecion, which no former system of fupcrftition had ever

attained. There is no power in the underflanding, and no pai on B ° K
in the heart, to which it does not preisnt objects adapted to rouse --
and to interest them. Neither the love of pleasure which at that 566
time prevailed in the court of France, nor the purIuits of ambition
'which occupied the court of Spain, had secured them from the
dominion of bigotry. Laymen and courtiers were agitated with
that furious and unmerciful zeal which is commonly confidercd as
peculiar to ecclesiastics; and kings and miniftcrs thought theim-
selves bound in conscience to extirpate the protestant doc'trine.
Mary herself was deeply tindured with all the prejudices of
popery; a passionate attachment to that iuperftition is vilible in
every'part of her character, and runs through all the fccnes of hcr
life: fle was devoted too with the utmost fubinillion to the princes
of Lorrain, her uncles; and had been accultomcd from her infancy
to liften to all their advices with a filial relpect. The prolpeet of
restoring the public exercise of her own religion, the pleasure of
complying with her uncles, and' the hopes of gratifying the French
monarch, whom the present situation of her affairs in England
made it neceiary to court, counterbalanced all the prudent con-
fiderations which had formerly weighed with her. She inrialtly
joined the confederacy, which had been formed for tlhe dciltuicioa
of the protestants, and altered the whole plan of her condudt with
regard to Murray and his adherents ".

To this fatal resolution may be imputed all the subsequent cala-

mities of Mary's life. Ever since her return into Scotland, fortune
may be laid to have been propitious to her, rather than adverc ;
and if her prosperity did not rife to any great height, it had, how-
ever, fuflered no considerable interruption. A thick and fettled cloud

nient of the Romifl religion in Scotland '. The Lords of tle
Articles were cllofcn, as usual, to prepare the business rwhicl was
to come before the parliament. They were all persons in whom
the queen could confide, and bent to promote her designs. The
ruin of iMurray and his party seemed now inevitable, and the
danger of the reformed church imminent, when an event unex-
pe&edly happened which saved both. If we regard either the

qualities of his mind correlponded ill with the beauty of his person.
Of a weak understanding, and without experience, conceited, at
the fame time, of his own abilities, and ascribing his extraor-
dinary fucccfs entirely to his diltinguillied merit. All the queen's
favour made no imprefiion on such a temper. All her gentleneis
could not bridle his imperious anl ungovernable plirit. All her
attention to place about him prerfons capable of direling his con-
ducl-, could not preserve him from rails and imprudent aclions
Fond of all the amusements, and even prone to all the vices of
youth, he became by degrees carclefs of her person, and a stranger
to her company. To a woman, and a queen, fullc behaviour was
intolerable. The lower flie had stoopcd in order to rails him, his
behaviour appeared the more ungenerous and criminal: and in
proportion to the strength of her rftir afrc&ion, was the violence
with which her disappointed paflion now operated. A fie inontihs
after the marriage their domefic quarrels began to be observcd.
The extravagance of Darnly's ambition gave riic to thcfe. Instead
of being satisfied with a share in the aiminitration of govern-

stretch of power, had conferred on him, he demanded thle Crown

difplcaftire; and as it was impoitble for Mary to behave towards
lher husband with the fame affetion which distinguished the first
and happy days of their union, he imputed this coldness, not to
his own behaviour, which had so well merited it, but to the infi-
nuations of Rizio. Mary's own conduEt confirmed and strength-
.ened these suspicions. She treated this stranger with a familiarity,
and admitted him to a share in her confidence, to which neither
his firlt condition, nor the office fle had lately bestowed on him,
gave him any title. I-Ie was perpetually in her presence, inter-
meddled in every business, and, together with a few favourites,
was the companion of all her private amusements. The haughty
spirit of Darnly could not bear the intrusion of fuich an upstart;
and impatient of any delay, and unrestrained by any scruple, he
inflantly resolved to get rid of him by violence.

Murray, though in the late infurredion they had deserted him, E °0 K
for various rcatons. Morton was nearly allied to the family of -----
Angus, and, during the minority of the present earl, aaed as chief
of the name of Douglas. Ruthven was married to the king's aunt.
Lindsay's wife was of the fame blood. All there had warmly
concurred with the queen in promoting a marriage which did so
much honour to the house of Douglas, and naturally expctied,
that, under a king of their own blood, the chief manaagement of
affairs would be committed to them. Maitland, with his usual
sagacity, foresaw that Murray's opposition to the match would
prove dangerous and ineffeAual ; but whoever ruled at court, he
hoped, by his dextcrity and talents, to render hilnielf ncceflary
and of importance. They were all equally dilappointcd in their
expeaations. The king's hcadftrong temper rendered him in-
capable of advice. The queen could not help difirutling men
who had been so long and so intimately conneced witlh Murray,
and gave herself up entirely to fucli counsellors as complied with
all her inclinations. The return of that nobleman and his fol-
lowers was therefore the only event which could restore Morton,
M4aitland, and their afrociates, to their former ascendant over the
qucen's councils. For this reason, nothing could be more mortify-
ing to them, than the rciolution which Mary had taken to treat the
exiles with rigour. This they imputed to Rizio, who, after he had
engaged to aid Murray with all his interest, was now the mofl active
inflrumcnt in promoting the measures which were concerted for
the ruin of that nobleman. This officious zeal completed the
difgufl which they had conceived against him, and inspired them
with thoughts of vengeance, in no wife suitable to jultice, to hu-
manity, or to their own dignity.

bto 'inrderC execution of this design. Nothing could be more acceptable to
1him. theem than this overture. They saw at once all the advantages

they would reap, by the concurrence of such an aflbciatc. Their
own private revenge upon Rizio would pass, they hoped, for
an aCt of obedience to the king-; and they did not dcfpair of
obtaining the restoration of their baniihed friends, and fccurity
for the protestant religion, as the price of their compliance with
his will.

BUT as Henry was no less fickle than rafli, they hesitated for

some time, and determined to advance no farther, without taking
every pollible precaution for their own safety. They did not, in
the mean time, inffcr the king's resentment to abate. AMorton,
who was inferior to no man of tlat intriguing age in all the arts
of insinuation and address, took the young prince under his ma-
nagement. I-Ic wrought upon his ruling paflion, ambition to obtain

the queen to be the chief and only ol)ftacle to his success in that
demand. This minion alone, he laid, poflsieed her confidence;
and out of complaisance to him, her subjects, her nobility, and
even her husband, were excluded from any participation of her
lccret councils. Under the appearance of a confidence merely
political, he insinuated, and the king perhaps believed, that a
familiarity of a quite different and very criminal nature might be
concealed ". Such various and complicated paflions raged in the

carry on any criminal intrigue with Rizio. But the silence of Randolph, the Eng-

p;lac this detefPable crime. Every circumstance here paints and charac-

tcrifes the mann-rs and men of that age, and fills us with horror
at both. The place chosen for committing such a deed, was the
queen's bedchamber. Though IMary was now in the sixth monthl
of her pregnancy, and though Rizio might have been fcized else-
where without any difficulty, the king pitched upon this place,
that lie might enjoy the malicious pleasure of reproaching Rizio
with his crimes before the queen's face. The earl of Morton, the
lord high chancellor of the kingdom, undertook to direc an enter-
priic, carried on in defiance of all the laws of which he was bound
to be the guardian. The lord Ruthvcn, who had been confined to
his bed for three months by a very dangerous distemper, and who
was frill so feeble that he could hardly walk, or bear the weight
of his own armour, was intrusted with the executive part; and
while he himself needed to be supported by two men, he came
abroad to commit a murder in the presence of his sovereign.

ON the ninth of March, Morton entered the court of the palace

with an hundred and sixty men; and without noise, or meeting
with any resistance, seized all the gates. While the queen was
at supper with the countess of Argyll, Rizio, and a few donmeftics,
the king suddenly entered the apartment by a private pafiage. At
his back was Ruthven, clad in complete armour, and with that
ghastly and horrid look which long sickness had given him. Three

IN this conspiracy there is one circumflance which, though

somewhat detached, deserves not to be forgotten. In the confe-
deracy between the king and the conspirators, the real intention of
which was aflaffination, the preserving of the reformed church is,
nevertheless, one of the most considerable articles; and the fame
men who were preparing to violate one of the first duties of mo-
rality, affeEed the highest regard for religion. History relates
these extravagances of the human mind, without pretending to
justify, or evexi to account for them; and regulating her own
opinions by the eternal and immutable laws of justice and of vir-
tue, points out such inconsistencies, as features of the age which she
dcfcribes, and records them for the inflrua'ion of ages to come.

The pafnion of revenge was nouritcd by all thiel means, and grew,
by daily indulgence, to be increcdibly firong. Mankind became

tcOion they expected impunity. The administration of juPlice
was extrei-lcy feeble and dilatory. An attempt to punifi the
crilems of a chieftain, or even of his v.afill, often excited rcbel-
lions and civil wars. To nolles, haughty and independent, among
xv.inmn the causes of discord were many and unavoidable, who were
(luick in dilcerl-ing an injury, and impatient to revenge it; who
deemed it infiamous to lfbinit to an enemy, and cowardly to for-
give him ; who confidered' the right- of punifling those who had
injured them, as a privilege of their order and a mark of inde-
pendence ; such flow proceedings were extremely unsatisfactory.
The blood of their adverifry was, in their opinion, the only tlling
which could wafli away an affront; where that was not hecd,
their revenge -was dilppointed, their courage became fjllfpeeed,
and a stain was left on their honour. That vengeance, lwhich the
impotent hand of the magiitrate could not inflicE, their own could
easily execute. Under governments so feeble, men, aflu.med, as in
a state of nature, the right of judging, and redressing their own
wrongs; and thus affilination, a crime of all others the most de-
firutive to focicty, came not only to be allowed, but to be rec-
koned honourable.

'ITE lhifory of Europe, during the fourteenth and fifteenth

centuries, abounds with detestable instances of this crime. It pre-
vailed chiefly among the French and Scots, between whom there
was a close intercourlf at that time, and a furpriling resemblance
in their national characters. In one thousand four hundred and
seven, the only brother of the king of France was murdered pub-

licly

I'cly in the flrcets of Paris; and so far was this horrible acion dii 1 o .
,roin Imeeting witlh l'roper punilihment, that an eminent lawyer --- --
was allowed to plead in defence of it before the peers of France,
and avowedly to maintain the lawfilncfs of aflhfl;nation. In one
tioul'tlnd four hundred and feventccn, it required all the eloquence
and authorii- of tle famous Gerlbon, to prevail on the coutncil of
Constance to condemn this propolition, ''lThat there are Iloie c;ies
in wlhich aflailnation is a virtue more meritorious in a knii.;lt tllan

in a lfquire, and more meritorious in a king than in a kighl ."
The number of eminent perbons who were murdered in France
and Scotland, on account cither of private, or political, or religious
quarrels, during the fifteenth and lixteenthl centuries, is almofl
incredible. IEvcn after those caufcs, whiclh fl-r gave riiI to this
barbarous practice, were removed ; after tlhe jouril.liaion of inagi-
ftrates, and the authority of laws, were better ellablilhcd, and
become more universal; after the progress of learning and philo-
sophy had poliihed the mtanners, and humanized the minds of
men, this crime continued in some degree. It was towards the
close of the seventeenth century before it difappcarcd in France.
The additional vigour, which the royal authority acquired by the
acceflion of James VI. to the throne of England, seems to have
put a flop to it in Scotland.

TI-E influence, however, of any national cu lnom, both on the

inderflandling and on the heart, and how far it may go towards
.perverting or cxtinguifhing moral principles of the grcateft import-
ance, is remarkable. The authors of tlhof ages have pcrfectly

account of it fomei flort time before his ov>n death, and in all his
long narrative there is not one cxpreffion of regret, or one fympl
toin of compuncllion, for a crime no les difhlonourable than barba -

in that turbulent age, when so many vafl projecs were laid open

more singular expedients for obtaining power '. \When alnimol

cious minificrs employed by Elizabeth, points him out as a person who was to be

1560, " is departed to return into Scotland, and hath made boast that he will do great
things, and live in Scotland in defpitc of all men. He is a glorious, rafli, and ha-

the birth of a son, forced tears from her eyes. But before Mielvil

determine. Such delicate tranlitions of paflion can be diicerned only
by those who arc admitted near the persons of the parties, and who
can view the secret workings of the heart with calm and acute
obfervationi. Neither Knox nor Buchanan enjoyed these advan-
tages. Thleir humble fRation allowed them only a distant acccs to
the queen and her favourite. And the ardour of their zeal and
the violence of their prejudices rendered their opinions rash, prc-
cipitate, and inaccurate. It is by the efc;iCs of this reciprocal
palion, rather than by their accounts of it, tliat fublequent hiftori-
ans can judge of its reality.

ADVENTUROUS as Bothwell's projc& to gain the queen may

appear, it was. formed and carried on under very favourable
circumstances. Mary was young, gay, and affable. She pof-
feTled great sensibility of temper, and was capable of the utmofi
tenderneis of affc1-ion. She had placed her love on a very un-
worthy objec, who requited it with ingratitude, and treated hcr
writh negleCt, with insolence, and with brutality. All these flh
felt and reicntcd. In this situation, the attention and complaisance
of a man who had vindicated her authority and proteced her
person, who entered into all her views, who soothed all her
passions, who watched and improved every opportunity of infi-
nuating his design and recommending his paflion ", could hardly
fail of making an irnpreflion on a heart of such a frame as
Mary's.

lution, equally wild and dcliperate, of emblarking on board a Ithil,
wvlich he provided, and of flying into forcign parts. It is almoll
impossible to form any fatisfaclory colnjeture concerningl tlhe mo-
tives which influence a capricious and irregular mind. I-Ie hoped,
perhaps, to recommend hiimfelf to the Catholic princes on the
continent by his zeal for religion, and that they would employ
their interest towards reinstating him in the poflflion of that
power which he had loft. Perhaps he expedtcd nothing more than.
the comfort of hiding the disgrace under which he was now

conduc him into her own apartment. She endeavoured to draw
from him the reasons of the firange resolution which he had
taken, and to divert him from it. In spite however of all her
arguments and intreaties he remained silent and inflexible. Next
day the privy council, by her direction, expoftulated with him on
the fame head. He persisted, notwithfianding, in his sullenness
and obstinacy; and neither deigned to explain the motives of his
conduct, nor signified any intention of altering it. As he left the
apartment, he turned towards the queen, and told her that she
lhould not fee his face again for a long time. A few days after,
he wrote to Mary, and mentioned two things as grounds of his
tlifguft. She herself, he said, no longer admitted him into any
confidence, and had deprived him of all power; and the nobles,.
after her example, treated him with opena neglect, so that he
appeared in every place without the dignity and fplcnclour of

her negled and ill usage, might have disposed mankind to en-

mitted a narrative of this whole transaCtion both to the king and '------
to the queen mother of France. It is drawn with great art, and
sets Mary's conduR in the most favourable point of light .

ABOUT this time the license of the borderers called for redress;

and Mary resolving to hold a court of justice at Jedburgh, the
inhahitants of several adjacent counties were summoned to attend
their fovcreign in arms, according to custom '. Bothwell was a,
that time lieutenant or warden of all the marches, an office among
the most important in the kingdom; and though usually divided
into three diflin& governments, bestowed by the queen's favour
upon. him alone. In order to display his own- valour and activity
in the difsharge of this trust, he attempted to ieizc a gang of ban-
ditti, wlo, lurking among the marshes of Liddellfdlc, infcfted the
rcef of the country. But while he was laying hold upon one of Onlober 16.
those desperadoes, he was wounded by him in several places, so
that his followers were obliged to carry him to Hermitage catilc.

confidered as marking the anxiety of a lover, but little tiited the
dignity of a queen a. Finding that Bothwcll was threatened with.

The diflance between Jedburgh and Hcrmitage is eighteen Scottish miles,

through a country alioft impafTable. The season of the year was far advanced.
Bothwell seems to have been wounded in a fcuflTe, occasioned by the detf:iir of a
single man, rather than any open infurrecion of the borderers. It does not appear
that the queen was attended thither by any considerable train. Had any military
operation been necessary, ns is supposed, Good. vol. i. 304. it would have heen
extremely improper to rifque the queen's person in an expedition againfl thieves..
As loon as the queen found Bothwell to be in no danger, flie inflantly returned,
and after this we hear no more of the infurrecion, nor have we any proof that the
)ioters took refuge in England. As there is no farther evidence with, respect to the
motives of this extraordinary journey, the reader must judge what degree of credit
i. due to Knox and Buchanan,. who ascribe it to the queen's love of Bothwell.

_- .--- 'I The fatigue of fucl a journey, added to the anguifil of mind fie

',G. had lufircd on Bothwcll's account, threw her next morning into
a violent feverl. Her life was despaired of, but her youth, and
the vigour of her conflitution, resifted the malignity of her dif-
cafi:. During the continuance of the queen's illness, the king,
November . Lwho resided at Stirling, never came near Jedburgh ; and when

lie afterwards thought fit to make his appearance there, he met
with such a cold reception, as did not encourage him to make any
long flay d. Mary soon recovered flrength enough to return along
the eastern borders to Dunbar.

\IIILE fie resided in this place, her attention was turned to-

wards England. Elizabeth, notwithstanding her promise, and
even proclamations to the contrary, not only allowed, but encou-
raged, Miorton and his afbociates to remain in England c. Mary,
on the other hand, afforded her proteiion to several Englifil
fugitives. Each queen watched the motions of the other with a

it was affcrted, not only called upon, lbut obliged her to take one

the former; and if flic complied with the latter rcqucfl no title
to the crown could, with any colour of juflice, be set in oppc-
fition to that of the Scottish queen. Elizabeth was llgacious cnough
to fee the rcmotefi confcqucnccs of this motion, and obfcrved
theim witl the greatest anxiety. Mary, ly refuling io ofloten to
ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, had plainly intimated a detign of
embl)racing the firnf promiling opportunity for prolccutilg hlr right
to the Englilh crown ; and by her fecrct ncgociations, lhe had
gained many to favour her title g. All the Roman catholics ar-
dently wished for her fuccefion. Her gentlenels and humanity
had removed many of thole apprehcnlions wlich the proteflants
entertained on account of her religion. The court fat&ion, which.
envied the power of Cecil, and endeavoured to wrefl: the admini-
lfration out of his hands, advanced the pretensions of the Scottfil
queen in opposition to him. The union of the two kingdoms

FlizaibetlI's UNDER these circumfianccs, and while the nation was in fuic
'th' ;ecunt. a temTlper, a parliamentary declaration of Mary's title would have

been highly detrimental to Elizabeth. The present unsettled itate
of the fucceflion left much in her power. Her resentment alone
might have gone far towards excluding any of the competitors
from the crown; and the dread of this had hitherto restraincd and
overavwed the ambition of the Scottifhl queen. But if this check
should be removed by the legal acknowledgment of her title, Mary
would be more at liberty to pursue her dangerour dcfigns, and to
ad without fear or refcrve. Her partifarls were already meditat-
ing fihemnes for iniirrections in different parts of the kingdom';
and an ac of parliament, recognising the rights of that priiiccls,
whose pretensions they favoured, would have been nothing Ics
than a signal to arms; and notwithstanding Elizabeth's just title to
the affeCtions of her ubjedCt, might have shaken and endangered

pears to be extremely bold. Having formerly held a fccrct cor-

nuncio from the pope publicly to enter her dominions. Cardinal
Laurca, at that time bifshop of Mondovi, was the person on whom
Pius V. conferred this oflice, and along with him he sent the
queen a prelent of twenty thouIand crowns . It is not the cha-
racer of the papal court to open its treasury upon distant or
imaginary hopes. The business of the nuncio in Scotland could
be no other, than to attempt a reconciliation of that kingdom

mention it. Le Croc's first letter is dated December 2, some time prior to the
arnival of the earl of Bedford in Scotland; and when his infhtua.ions, either
public or fecrct, could hardly be known. Le Croc plainly fuppcfes that the
dilcord between the Icing and queen was the cause of his absence from the baptifn,
and his account of this matter is that which I have followed, Keith, Pref. vii.

symptoms of liberality, some stretch towards munificence, might
have been cxpeLted in an assignment which was made with an 15
intention of oiothing and silencing the clergy. But both the queen
and the nobles held fast the riches of the church which they had
feizcl. A fum which, at the highest computation, can hardly be
reckoned equal to nine thousand pounds fterlingc, was deemed
sufficient for the maintenance of a lwhole national church, by men
vwho had lately seen single monaftcrics poffcfied of revenues iar
filpcrior in value.,

THrE ecclcliaflics in that age bore the grievances which affcacd

thcmlflves alone with aftonifluing patience; but wherever the
reformed religion was threatened, they were extremely apt to
be alarmed, and to proclaim, in the loudest manner, their ap-
prehensions of danger. A just occasion of this kind was given
them, a short time before the meeting of the aflcmbly. The
uiSrpcd and oppressive juriiifdiion of the spiritual courts had
been aboliflhed by the parliament in the year one thousand five
hundred and sixty, and comiifltrics were appointed to hear and
detcrmine the caufcs which formerly came under their cognizance s.
Among the few a'ts of that parliament to which Mary had paid
any regard, this was one. She had confirmed the authority of
the commifaries, and had given them inftrudions for direcing
their proceedings ', which are still of great authority in that court.
From the time of their first appointment, there judges had con-
tinued in the uninterrupted exercise of their fundion, when of a
sudden the queen ifrucd a proclamation, rcftoring the archbishop

1566.

A MOTIVE, which cannot be justified, rendered the queen not

unwilling to venture upon this rash ation. She had been con-
triving for some time how to re-establish the popish religion; and
the restoring the ancient ecclesiastics to their former jurifdiition
seemed to be a considerable flep towards that end. The motive
which prompted Bothwell, to whose influence over the queen this
action mufi be chiefly imputed ', was flill more criminal. His en-
terprifing ambition had already formed that bold design, which he
soon after put in execution; and the uife which we shall hereafter
find him making of that authority which the popifl ecclesiastics
regained, discovers the reasons of his present conduc, in con-
tributing to revive their power. The protestant clergy were not
unconcerned fpedators of an event which threatened their reli-
gion with unavoidable deftruCion; but as they despaired of ob-
taining the proper remedy from the queen herself, they addressed
a remonPtrance to the whole body of the protestant nobility, full
of that ardent zeal for religion, which the danger to which it was
exposed at that time, seemed to require '. What effects this ve-
hement exhortation might have produced, we have no opportu-
nity of judging, the attention of the nation being quickly turned
towards events of another and more tragical nature.

danger.

The brcach THE breach between Mary and her husband was not occasioned
betweel
them irre- by any of those flight disgusts which interrupt the domeflic union,
parablc. without difiblving it altogether. Almost all the passions which

operate with greatest violence on a female mind, and drive it to
the most dangerous extremes, concurred in raising and fomenting
this unhappy quarrel. Ingratitude for the favours flie had be-
flowed, contempt of her perlbn, violations of the marriage-vow,
encroachments on her power, conspiracics against her favourites,
jealousy, insolence, and obflinacy, were the injuries of which
Mary had great reason to complain. She felt them with the ut-
mofl sensibility; and added to the anguish of disappointcd love,
they produced those fymptons of despair which we have already
described. Her rqfentment againfl the king seems not to have
abated from the time of his leaving Stirling. In a letter written
with her own hand to her ambassador in France, on the day be-
fore she set out for Glasgow, no tokens of sudden reconcilement

king's ingratitude, the jealousy with which he observcd her a&ions,
and the inclination he discovered to disturb her government, and
at the fame time talks of all his attempts with the utmost scorn .

Virits the AFTER this discovery of Mary's sentiments, at the time of her
king at las- departure from Edinburgh to Glasgow, a visit to the king, which

had been negleced when his situation rendered it most necefrary,
appears singular, and it could hardly be expeted that any thing

view. This, however, was far friom being the cai ; flhe not -----
only visited Henry, but, by all her words and aaions, cndca-
voured to express an uncommon affSetion for him:: and though
this made iinpreffion on the credulous ipirit of her huiband, no
less flexible on some occasions, than obflinatc on others; yet,
to thole who are acquainted with the human heart, and wlio
know how seldom and how slowly tiLch wounds in domcltic
happiness are healed, this fuddcn transition will appear with a
very suspicious air, and will be contidered by them as the effic
of artifice.

BUT it is not on suspicion alone, that Mary is charged with 1Hm. di inmu-

diflimulation in this part of her conduct. Two of her famous
letters to Bothwell were written during her flay at Glasgow,
and fully lay open this scene of iniquity. I-e had lo far
succeeded in his ambitious and criminal delign, as to gain an
absolute ascendant over the queen; and in a situation fitch as
Mary's, merit not so conspicuous, fcrviccs of far inferior import-
ance, and addrels much lels inlmuating than Bothwecll's, mlay
be fuippofed to steal imperceptibly on a female heart, and entirely
to overcome it. Unhappily, among those in the higher ranks
of life, scruples with regard to conjugal fidelity are, often, neither
many nor strong: nor did the manners of tlat court in which
Mary had been educated, contribute to increase or to fortify
them. The amorous turn of Francis I. and -lHenry 11. the
wildncfs of the military character in that age, and the liberty of
appearing in all companies, which began to be allowed to women,
who had not yet acquired that delicacy of sentiment, and those
polified manners, which alone can render this liberty innocent,
had introduced, among the French, a licentioufiefs of morals that

role

B O 0 K rose to an aflonifhing height. Such examples, which were fami-

Iv.
.--.--. liar to Mary from her infancy, could hardly fail of diminishing

7 that horror of vice which is natural to a virtuous mind. The

king's behaviour would render the first approach of forbidden
Sentiments less shocking; resentment, and disappointed love,
would be apt to represent whatever soothed her revenge, as jufti-
fiable on that account; and so many concurring causes might,
almost imperceptibly, kindle a new passion in her heart.

Tie motives BUT whatever opinion we may form with regard to the rife
CEit.

and progress of this passion, the letters thlemfcles breathe all the
ardour and tenderness of love. The affection which Mary there
exprcffcs for Bothwell, fuilv accounts for every ublfequent part of
her conduct; which, without admitting this circumstance, appears
altogether mysterious, inconsistent, and inexplicable. That re-
concilement with her husband, of which, if we allow it to be
genuine, it is impossible to give any plausible account, is discovered
by the queen's own confeflion to have been mere artifice and deceit.
As her aversion for her husband, and the suspicious attention with
which she observed his conduCt, became universally known, her
ears were officiously filled, as is usual in such cafes, with ground-
less or aggravated accounts of his actions. By tome mhe was told,
that the king intended to seize the perlon of the prince his Ion,
and in his name to usurp the government; by others she was
assured that he resolved inflantly to leave the kingdom; that a
vessel was hired for this purpose, and lay in the river Clyde ready
to receive him°. The last was what Mary chiefly dreaded.
Henry's retiring into a foreign country must have been highly
dishonourable to the queen, and would have entirely disconcertcd

his family was greatest, he might with more facility accompillifh
his designs. In order, therefore, to prevent his cxecuting any
such wild fchcmc, it was necessary to bring him to some place
where he would be more immcdiately under her own eye. For
this purpose, she first employed all her art to regain his confidence,
and then propocfd to remove him to the neighbourhood of Edin- Prevails on

susser himfclf to be persuaded ; and being still feeble, and incapable
of bearing fatigue, was carried in a litter to Edinburgh.

TIIE place prepared for his reception was a house belonging

to the provost of a collegiate church, called Kirk of Field. It
fiood almost upon the tfame i}pot where the house belonging to the
principal of the univcrfity now flands. Such a situation, on a
rising ground, and at that time in an open sicld, had all the ad-
vantages of healthful air to recommend it; but, on the other
hand, the solitude of the place rendered it extremely proper for
the commifflon of that crime, with a view to which it tCems ma-
nifeflly to have been chosen.

MARY continued to attend the king with the most assiduous 1Te is mur-

care. She fcldom was absent from hima through the day; she
slept two nights in the chamber under his apartment. She heaped
on him so many marks of tenderness and confidence, as in a great
measure quieted those fuli4icions which had lo long diflurbed him.

567-. On Sunday the ninth of February, about eleven at night, the

queen left the Kirk of Field, in order to be present at a masque
in the palace. At two next morning, the house in which the king
lay was blown up with gunpowder. The noise and flock which
this sudden explosion occasioned, alarmed the whole city. The
inhabitants ran to the place whence it came. The dead body of
the king, with tlat of a servant who slept in the fame room, were
found lying in an adjacent garden without the city wall, un-
touched by lire, and with no bruise or mark of violence.

His charac- SUCII was tle unhappy fate of H-lenry Stewart lord Darnly, in
ter.

the twenty-fir.f year of his age. The indulgence of fortune, and
his own external accompliihments, without any other merit, had
raised him to an height of dignity of which he was altogether un-
worthy. By his folly and ingratitude, he loft the heart of a
woman who doateci on him to diftradcion. His insolence and in-
constancy alienated from him such of the nobles as had contributed
most zealously towards his elevation. His levity and caprice ex-
posed him to the scorn of the people, who once revered him as
the descendant of their ancient kings and heroes. IHad he died a
natural death, his end would have been unlamented, and his me-
mory have been forgotten; but the cruel circumstances of his
murder, and the shameful remissness in negleLting to avenge it,
have made his name to be remembered with regret, and have
rendered him the objet of pity, to which he had otherwilc no
title.

Of Bothwcll's guilt there remains tlec fullest evidence that the
nature of the action will admit. The qucen's known fentimcnts
with regard to her husband, gave a great appearance of probability
to the imputation with which fle was loaded '

Two days after the murder, a proclamation was ificld by the

queen, offering a conliderable r-eward to any person wlio fiould
dilcover those who had been -guilty of flich a horrid and dctcflable
crime ; and though Botliwcll was now one of the greatest lifbjeLs
in the kingdom, formidable on account of lhis own power, and
proteced by the queen's favour, it was impoflible to fiipprcls the
fcntiments and indignation of the people. Papers were aflixed to
the moll public places of the city, accusing him of tile murder,
and naming his accomplices; picurcs appeared to tile ime pur-
pole, and voices were heard in tle middle of tlc night, charging
him with that barbarous action. But the authors of theie rumours
did not confine their accusations to Bothwell alone; they inlinu-
ated that the queen licrfelf was acceflary to the crime '. Tiis

most indecent remiffnels, and in such a manner as to let in no
light upon that scene of guilt x

IT was not her own subje&s alone who fufpeted Mary of

having been acccflury to this unnatural crime; nor did an opinion,
so diflhonourable to her charadcer, owe its rife and progress to the
jealousy and malice of her fadious nobles. The report of the
manner and circumstances of the king's murder spread quickly
over all Europe, and, even in that age, which was accustomed to
deeds of violence, it excited universal horror. As her unhappy
breach with her husband had long been matter of public discourse,
the first conjectures which were formed with regard to his death,
were extremely to her disadvantage. Her friends, at a loss what
apology to offer for her conduct, called on her to prosecute the
murderers with the utmost diligence, and expeted that the rigour
of her proceedings would prove the best and fullest vindication of
her innocence Y

his tial. time might bring to light the circulmflances of a crime in which

so many accomplices were concerned, it was of great importance
to hurry over the trial, while nothing more than general sus-
picions, and uncertain surmises, could be produced by his ac-
culers. For this rcafon, in a meeting of privy council held on
the twenty-cilghth of MIarch, the twelfth of April was appointed
for the day of trial. Though the law allowed, and the manner
in which criminal causes were carried on in that age required, a
much longer interval, it appears from several circumflances that
this fiort space was considerably contraced, and that Lennox
had only eleven days warning to prepare for accusing a person so
far fiperior to hinifelf both in power and in favour '. No man
could be less in a condition to contend with an antagonist who

It is true, Mary, in her letter, March 24th, invited Lennox to come to Edinburgh
the ensuing week; this gave him warning some days sooner, that she intended to
bring on the trial without delay. But the precise time could not be legally or
certainly known to Lennox sooner than ten or twelve days before the day on which
he was required to appear. By the law and practice of Scotland, at that
time, parties were summoned, in cafes of treason, forty days previous to the
trial.

rcRored to him when he was called into Scotland, it seems to
have been considerably impaired during his banifhmcnt. I-Iis

over them, which a feudal chief usually poflcfcd. I-e had no reason
to expect the concurrence of any of those fatlions into which the
nobles were divided. During the flort period of lis son's pro-
fpcrity, he had taken such ftcps as gave rife to an open breach
with Miurray and all his adherents. The p)artitlans of the houtf
of Hamilton were his hcreditary and mortal enemies. Huntly
was linked in the clofcft confederacy with Bolhowell ; and thus,
to the disgrace of the nation, Lennox flood alone in a cause where
both honour and humanity called so loudly on his countrymen to
fccond him.

IT is remarkable too, that Bothwell himself was prefcnt, and

fat as a member in that meeting of privy council, which gave
directions with regard to the time and manner of his trial; and
he fill enjoyed not only full liberty, but was received into

held with the accustomcd formalities. An indiLtment was pre-

his accuiation. In his namne appeared Robert Cunningham, one
of his dependants. I-Ie cxcufcd his nmafer's ablence, on account
of the fliortnefs of the time, which prevented his aflhmbling his

time ought to be deemed illegal and void. Botlhwell, on the
other hand, insisted that the court fiould inflantly proceed to trial.
One of Lennox's own letters, in which he craved of the queen
to prosecute the murderers without delay, was produced. Cun-
ningham's objections were over-ruled ; and the jury, confifling of
peers and barons of the first rank, found Bothwell not guilty of

likewise, that the ninth inftcad of the tenth of February was
mentioned in the indicment, as the day on which the murder
had been committed : a circumstance which dilcovers the extreme
inaccuracy of those who prepared the indictment; and at a time
when men were disposcd, and not without reason, to be suspicious
of every thing, this small matter contributed to confirm and to
increase their ifufpicions '

EVEN Bothwell himself did not rely on the judgment which

he had obtained in his favour, as a full vindication of his inno-
cence. Immediately after his acquittal, he, in compliance with a
cuf0om which was not then obsolete, publilhed a writing, in which
he offered to fight in single combat any gentleman of good fame
who fihould presume to accuse him of being accelary to the
murder of the king.

to that purpose, and in confcuence of theif had ventured upon
some lfeps more public and vigorous than any ihe had formerly
taken. But though none of thefc circumflances were unknown
to Bothwell, there were powerful motives lwhich prompted himi
at this junEture to conciliate the good-will of the protestants, by
exerting himself in order to procure for them some additional
security in the exercise of their religion. That which they en-
joyed at present was very precarious, being founded entirely on
the royal proclamation ifiued soon after the arrival of the queen
in Scotland, which in express terms was declared to be only a
temporary regulation. From that period, neither the solicitations
of the general aflemblies of the church, nor the intreaties of her
people, could extort from Mary any concession in favour of the
protestant religion, on which the professors might reft with greater
confidence. This, however, by the more powerful influence of
Bothwell, they now obtained. An a&t was passed in this parlia-
ment, repealing all the laws, canon, civil, and municipal, adverse
to the reformed religion, and exempting such as had embraced it
from the penalties to which they might have been fubjeded by
these laws, either on account of their past conduCt or present
profession; declaring at the fame time that their persons, estates,
honours, and benefices were taken under public protection against
every court, civil or ecclesiastical, that might attempt to molelt
them on account of their religious sentiments. Thus the protest-

than a declaration of royal indulgence, which might be revoked '------
at pleasure, obtained legal and parliamentary protecion in the
exercise of their religion. By prevailing on the queen to assent
to this law, Bothwell seems to have flattered himfcif that he would
acquire such merit both with the clergy and with the people, as
might induce them to favour his ambitious fchem s, and to connive
at what he had done, or might do, in order to accomplifli them.

of great value. The framers of the law fee marnaifeflly to have viewed it in that

In order to secure this, he, immediately after the diflblution of
parliament, invited all the nobles who were present to an enter-

ants, and fuirroulldd it with armed men , he opened to the
company his intention of marrying the queen, wliofc consent, he

-;ith great art. This art is peculiarly manifest in the concluding clause. In her

first proclamation the queen lhat declared, thatt ithould continue in force only until
The fiould take final order concerning religion with the advice of parliament. In
this adt the intention of taking further order concerning religion is mentioned,
probably with a view to plcafc the queen ; but it is worded with such fludicd dcxterity,
that the protection granted by this law is no longer to be regarded as temporary, or
icpending, upon the queen's taking such final order. Parl. I K. Ja. VI. c. 3r.
Jn tlhe flme light of an important acquisition of security to the reformed religion, this
ancq is reprcfented by the privy council in a proclamation issued May 23, 1567,
Keith, 571. M\Iary's principal adherents, in a paper filbfcribed by them Sept. 12,
I 568, declare, that file, " by the advice of the three cftates, had satisfied the defirc
of the whole nobility in ani a concerning all the points of religion paifed in the par-
liament held April 1567." Goodal, ii. 357. The fame is afierted to be the
intention and cffect of this adn in another public paper in the year 1570. Haynes,
62r. From confidering all these particulars, one need not wonder that a law
" anent cafling (as its title bears), annulling, and abrogating of all laws, ads, and
constitutions, canone, civile, and municipal, with other conflitutions, contrare to
the religion now profeflit within the rcalmc," confirmed by the royal afnent of the

supposed to have united men of iuch opposite principles and
parties, in recommending to their fovercign a fltp lo injurious to
her honour, and so fatal to her peace. This firange coalition was
the effet of much artifice, and must be confidered as the boldest
and lmolt masterly stroke of Bothwell's address. It is observable,
that amidfl all the altercations and mutual reproaches of the two
parties which arole in the kingdom, this unworthy tranfadion is
fcldom mentioned. Conscious on both fides, that in this parti-
cular their conduct could ill bear examination, and would redound
little to their fame, they always touch upon it unwillingly, and
witll a tender hand, Ieeming dcfilous that it should remain in
darkness, or be buried in oblivion. 13ut as so many persons who,
both at that time and ever after, possessed the queen's favour sub-
fcribcd this paper, the Lufpicion becomes firong, that Botlin cll's
ambitious hopcs were neither unknownr to MIary nor dilapproved

()f all the difircnt fyflcms with regard to this tranfiLtion, that of Camden

fiems to be the least accurate, and the worst founded. ITe filppores that Bothwell
was hated by) liurray, Mlorton, &c. who had been his associates in the murder of the
king, and that they now wanted to ruin him. He affirms, at the famle time, that the
subscriptions to this paper were obtained by them out of fear that roth'rell might fink
in his hopes, and betray the whole bloody fccrct, 404. But besides the absurdity of
fippofing that any man's enemies would contribute towards raising him to fulch high
dignity, on the uncertain hopes of being able aftelrwards to deprive him of it; bfcides
the impossibility of accomplishing such a marriage, if it had been either unknown to
the queen, or dilfagrccable to her; we may obfcive that this supposition is defltroved
by the direct tfllimony of the queen herself, who ascribes the content of the nobles

the marriage, and conjured the queen, on his knees, to lay aside all thoughts of

Boihwcllc.,r,- TrRElE days aftcr the riling of parliamlent IMary went from
by ob,'ce.! .j dinblu rgh to Stirling, in ordcr to visit the )prin-ic her son. Both-
euzibar~ . vell ihad now brought his 'c'cmcs to full nmaturity, and every

precalution being taken whlich could render it fa'e to enter on the
!itl and decisive ficp, the natural impctuofiry of his spirit did not
fiillr himn to deliberate any longer. Under prctrcnc of an expe-
dition against the frccbootcrs on the borders, lic afllenbled his
followers; and imarchingl out of Edinburgh with a thousand horse,
April z.2,. turned uddecnl y towards Linhlithgov, mnct the queen on her re-

turn near that place, disperscd her slender traill without refifl-
ance, icized on her pcrfon, and conduLeld her, togethler with a
few of her courtiers, as a prisoner to his castle of Dunbar. She
expressed neither furprifc, nor terror, nor indignation, at such an
outrage committed on her pcrfon, and filch an insult oflcred to
hcr authority, but fccmcd to iceld whithout struggle or regret'y.
rlclvil was at that time one of her attendants; and the officer by

lIhom hlie was feiedl illnfored himn, that nothing was done with-
out teic queen's own content ;:. If we may rely on the letters pub-
lificdl in Mary's name, the fchemc had been communicated to

have committed some mistake with rcgard to this fal, io far as relates to lord

by a fpccial corm iffion granted for this purpose, and pleaded,
that lady Jane and himself being cousins within the prohibited
degrees, and having married without a papal dispensation, their
union was null from the beginnilng . At the fame time lie pre-
vailed with lady Jane to apply to the proteflant court of com-
nifllaics for a divorce, on account of his having been guilty of
adultery. The influence of Bothwell 1was of equal wei1ght in
both courts. 1n tlhe courIe of four days, with tIle fame inldcccnI
and ifufticious prccipitancy, the one declared the marriage to be
illegal and null, the otlcer pronounced a sentence of divorce .

d* In her own time, it was urged as an aggravation of the queen's guilt,

that file gave her consent to marry the hufiband of another woman; and the charge
has been often repeated since. But, according to Miary's own id:as, consonant
to the principles of her religion, the marriage of lothwell with lady Jane Gordon
was unlawful and void, and she confidered them as living together not in the
hallowed bonds of matrimony, but in a slate of criminal intercourse. Bothv.ell's
addrcflcs, which firuck her proteflant fubje(ls not only as indecent but flagitious,
could not appear in the fame light to her; and this may be pleaded in extenuation of
the crime imputed to her of having liftcncd to them. But it will not exempt her from
the charge of great imprudence in this unfortunate flep. Mary was well acquainted
with the ideas of her fubjets, and knew what they would think of her giving
car for a moment to the courtflhip of a man lately married under her own eye,
in the church of her palace. Appendix, No. XX. Every consideration should

siel, and of eaify accefls, the qcuen might have bccn reicuc(d with-
out dilficulty out of his hands. In a place of fircnlgth ihe was
iccurc d friom all the attempts of his enemies.

AONE ftiall difficul ty Piill remained to be lilirnotunlted. As the

(quecn was kept iln a1 fort of captivity )by Bothwell, a r:lriage
concluded in that condition' might be imputed to force, and be
held invalid. In order to obviate this, Mary appeared in the
ccLr-t of Icilion, and, inl prelence ol the chancellor and other
judges, and f vcral of the nobility, declared that ihe was now at
full liberty; and though Bothwlell's violence in seizing her per-
Iobn had at firl't excited her indignation, yet his refe-liefl lbcha-
viour since that time had not only appeased her relcntment, but
determined her to raise himt to higher honours t.

Orkney was conferred upon Bothwvcll; and on tlie fifteenth of e
3lIay his marriage with the queen, wliici had io long been the
objet of his wililcs, and the motive of his crimes, was iblcnluizd.

manifest symptoms of the violent and general difhttisfa-ion of
her own fubjeCLs. The refusal of Du Croc, the French amnbaf-
fador, to be present at the nuptial ceremony or entertainment,
discovers the fcntimcnts of her allies with regard to this part of
her condu( ; and although everry other action in MAary's life could
be justified by the rules of prudence, or reconciled to the prin-
ciples of virtue, this fatal marriage would remain an incontcliablc
proof of her ratfines, if not of her guilt.

MIARY's firtl care was to ofler some apology for her conduc',

to the courts of Flrance and England. The inftruc(lions to her
ambassadors fill remain, and are drawn by a maflerly hand. But
unlder all the artificial and falfi colouring fie employs, it is cafy
to discover, not only ,that many of the steps she had taken were
unjustifiable, but that fle herfclf was conlcious that they could
not be jutilicd !.

TrI title of king was the only thing which was not beitowed

upon Bothwell. Notwitllianding her attachment to him, Mary
remembered the inconveniences which had arisen from the rafli
advancement of her former husband to that honour. She agreed,
however, that he should sign, in token of content, all the public
writs issued in her name '. But though the queen withheld from
him the title of king, lie pofleffed, neverthelels, regal power in
its full extent. The queen's person was in his hands; she was

motives determined the queen to march forward, with an incon-
fiderate and fatal 1i)ecd.

to the confederates the queen's inclinations towards peace, and
her willingness to pardon the offences which they had committed.
Morton replied with warmth, that they had taken arms not
against the queen, but againfl the murderer of her husband;

flie should find them ready to yield the obedience which is due
from fubjets to their fovcreign. Glencairn added, that they did

had offended. Such haughty anifwers convinced the ambassador,
that his mediation would be incffeatual, and that their pafflons
were to high to allow them to liften to any pacific propositions,
or to think of retreating after having proceeded so far".

them, by offering to decide the quarrel, and to vindicate his own
innocence, in single combat with any of Ihis advcrfarics. Kirkaldy

for the honour of entering the lifts against him. But this chal-

aid fr-om Elizabeth, and even without her knowledge %. Though
she was far from being displeased at feeing the affairs of that
kingdom embroiled, or a rival, whom Ihe hated, reduced to diftrels;
flci neither wished that it fiould be in the power of the one fation
cntirely to fupprcfs the other, nor could fle view the fleps taken

popular maxims by which she governed her own ful)jeas, her
notions of royal prerogative were very exalted. The confederates
had, in her opinion, encroached on the authority of their fove-
reign, which they had no right to control, and had offered
violence to her person, which it was their duty to cftcem sacred.
They had set a dangerous example to other fubjcd-s, and Mary's
cause became the common caute of princes '. If ever Elizabeth
was influenced with regard to the affairs of Scotland by the feelings
of her heart, rather than by considerations of interei, it was on
this occasion. Mary, in her present condition, degraded from
her throne, and covered with the infamy attending an accusation
of such atrocious crimes, could be no longer the cbJct& of

Scotland, wvith power to negotiate both with tle (lueen and witl
the confederates. In his inftrucions there appears a remarkable
solicitude for MIary's liberty, and even for her reputation ; and
the terms upon which she proposed to rc-eftablifl concord between
the queen and her ulb)jes, appcar to be so rcafbnable and Swell
digested, as might have cnfured the safety and happinef of both.
Zcalous as Throkmorton was to accomplish this, all his cndea-
Yours and addrcfs proved inefTciual. He found not only the
confederate nobles, but the nation in general, io fair alienated
from the queen, and so much ofltnded wkith the indecent pre-
cipitancy of her marriage with the reputed murderer of her
former husband, as to be incapable of listening to any propoftion
in her favour.

DURING the state of anarchy occasioncd by the impritbnmcnt

of the queen, and the difolution of the cltablifhcd govcrniment,
which afforded such ample scope for political fpeculatioi, four
different schemes had been proposed for the lfttlement of the
nation. One, tlat Mlary flould be replaced upon the throne,
but under various and ftrie limitations. The second, that ihe
hould resign the crown to her son, and retiring out of the king-
dom, should reside, during the remainder of her days, either in
England or in France. The third, that Mary flould be brought
to public trial for her crimes, and after convition, of which no
doubt was entertained, fiould be kept in perpetual imprilonment.
The fourth, that after trial and condemnation, capital puniflmenti
sfould be inflicied upon her. Throkmorton, though difioofcd, as
well by his owr inclination as in conformity to the spirit of his

---- informed his court, that the milder lihemes, recommended by

7. Maitland alone, would undoubtedly be reprobated, and one of

the more rigorous carried into execution.

IN justification of this rigour, the confederates maintained that

Mary's afFcc ion for Bothwell was flill unabated, and openly
avowed by her; that she rejected with disdain every proposal for
dissolving their marriage ; and declared, that file would forego
every comfort, and cndure any extremity, rather than give her
consent to that measure. *While tlielf were her sentiments, they
contended, that concern for the public welfare, as well as attention
to their own safety, rendered it necefary to put it out of the queen's
power to restore a daring man, exasperated by recent injuries, to
his former fiation, which muff needs prove fatal to both. Not-
w-ithfanding their solicitude to conciliate the good-will of Eliza-
beth, they foresaw clearly what would be the effet, at this junc-
ture, of Throknorton's interposition in behalf of the queen, and
that flic, elated with the proipicd- of protclion, would refule to
liften to the overtures 1which they were about to make to her.
For this reason they peremptorily denied Throkmorton acccfs to
their prisoner; and what propositions he made to them in her
behalf they either refutbd or eluded'..

B O 0 K BOTH parties agreed at last upon a scheme, neither so moderate

V.
--"'---' as the one, nor so daring as the other. Mary was to be persuaded

1567.

They oblige or forced to resign the crown; the young prince was to be
the queen to
resign the go- proclaimed king, and the carl of Murray was to be appointed to
vernnent. govern the kingdom, during his minority, with the name and

authority of regent. With regard to the queen's own person,
nothing was determined. It seems to have been the intention
of the confederates to keep her in perpetual imprisonment; but
in order to intimidate herself, and to overawre her partisans, they
still reserved to themfelvcs the power of proceeding to more
violent extremes.

IT was obvious to ibrefee difficulties in the execution of this

plan. Mary was young, ambitious, high-fpirited, and accuflomed
toco mmand. To induce her to acknowledge her own incapacity
for governing, to renounce the dignity and power which she
was born to enjoy, to become dependant on her own fubjeQs,
to consent to her own bondage, and to invest those persons whom
flie confidered as the authors of all her calamities with that honour
and authority of lwhich he herself was stripped, were points
hard to be gained. These, however, the confederates attempted,
and they did not want means to insure success. Mary had endured,
for several weeks, all the hardflips and terror of a prison; no pro-
fpe& of liberty appeared; none of her fubjets had either taken
arms, or to much as solicited her relief "; no person in whom she
could confide was admitted into her presence; even the ambaf-
iadors of the French king, and queen of England, were refuied
access to her. In this solitary ftatc, without a counsellor or a

by means io unequal to the end. In a warlike age, and in less
time than two months, a part of the nobles, vho neither pofledfed
the chief power nor the greatcfl wcaltl in the nation, and who
never brourght three thoullnd men into the field, seized, imprisoned,
and dethroned their queen, and without fhcdding a single drop of
blood, set her son, an infant of a year old, on the throne.

eaf.oningsof DURING this rapid progress of the confederates, the eyes of all
,baLi parties.

the nation were turned on them with aftoniflmcnt; and various
and contradiicory opinions were formed concerning the extraordi-
nary steps which they had taken.

EVEN under the ariflocratical form of government which pre-

vails in Scotland, Iaid the favourers of the queen, and notwith-
flanding the exorbitant privileges of the nobles, the prince pof-
Ifeles considerable power, and his person is treated with great ve-
neration. No encroachments mhould be made on the former, and
no injury offered to the latter, but in cafes where the liberty and
lhappinefs of the nation cannot be secured by any other means.

well's delpendants were convicted of being guilty of the king's
murder, and suffered death as traitors. Their conffllions brougiht
to light many circumnlances relative to the manner of committing

NOTWVI'rITSTANDING the universal fuhlniffion to the regent's

authority, there flill abounded in the kingdom many secret inur-
murs and cabals. The partisans of the house of Hamilton reckoned
Murray's promotion an injury to the duke of Chatelherault, who,
as firfl prince of the blood, had, in their opinion, an undoubted
right to be regent. Tlhe length and rigour of Mary's funferings
began to move many to comnmiferate her cafe. All who leaned
to the ancient opinions in religion dreaded the effects of Murray's
zeal. And he, though his abilities were great, did net poflcls

gained or softened many who had opposed him ; but lie was a -----
stranger to these gentle arts. -Iis virtues were feverc; and his
deportment towards his equals, efpccialiy after his elevation to the
regency, distant and haughty. This behaviour ostended tonie of
the nobles and alarmed others. The queen's faCtion, which had
been so easily dispersed, began again to gather and to unite, and
was secretly favoured by foine who had hitherto zcalouny con-
curred with the confederates ".

Suct was the favourable diflofition of the nation towards the Mary )crclapl

from Loch-

queen, when she recovered her liberty, in a manner no Icts fur- levin.
prifing to her friends, than unexpected by her enemies. Several
attempts had been made to procure her an opportunity of escaping,
which some unforeseen accident, or the vigilance of her keepers,
had hitherto disappointed. At last Mary employed all her art to
gain George Douglas, her keeper's brother, a youth of eighteen.
As her manners were naturally affable and insinuating, she treated
him with the most flattering difintion ; fe even allowed him to
entertain the most ambitious hopes, by letting fall some exprclfons,
as if ihe would chufe him for her husband c. At his age, and in
such circumstances, it was impoflible to resist such a temptation.
He yielded, and drew others into the plot. On Sunday the second
of May, while his brother fat at supper, and the reft of the family
were retired to their devotions, one of his accomplices found
means to steal the keys out of his brother's chamber, and opening
the gates to the queen and one of her maids, locked them behind
her, and then threw the keys into the lake. Mary ran with pre-
cipitation to the boat which was prepared for her, and on reaching
the ihore was received with the utiloft joy, by Douglas,lord

fplcndid train of nobles, accompanied by such numbers of fol-
lowers, as formed an army above fix thousand strong. In their
pretence fle declared that the resignation of the crown, and the
other deeds which flhe had signed during her imprifonmcnt, were
extorted from her by fear. Sir Robert Melvil confirmed her
declaration; and on that, as well as on other accounts, a council
of the nobles and chief men of her party pronounced all these
May 8. tranfaaions void and illegal. At the fame time an association was

formed for the defence of her person and authority, and sub-
fcribcd by nine earls, nine bifiops, eighteen lords, and many
gentlcmen of difinstion '. Among them we find several who had
been present in the last parliament, and who had signed the
counter-afibciation in defence of the king's government; but
iclh sudden changes were then so common, as to be no matter
of reproach.

Conpternh- AT the time when the queen made her escape the regent was

their expedations, and so fatal to their schemes, gave a great shock

queen; and oime openly revolted to her fide. In lb dillicult a .-_
julncure, where his own fame, and tlie being of the party, de- ''
pendcd on his' choice, the regent's nmolt faithf'ul aflociates were
divided in opinion. Some advised him to retire, without lois of
time, to Stirling. The queen's army was already firong, and
only eight miles distant; the adjacent country was fiull of the
fiiends and dependents of the Iioufe of Hamnilton, and other
lords of the queen's failion; Glasgow was a laru e and un-
fortified town; his own train coniftced of no greater number
than was usual in times of peacc ; all there rcafons pleaded for a
retreat. But on the other hand, arguments were tirged of no
inconliderable weight. The citizens of Glasgow were well
affected to the cause; the vatfals of Glencairn, Lcnnox, and
Semple, lay near at hand, and cwere both numerous and full of
zeal; succours might arrive from other parts of the kingdom in
a few days; in war, ficcefs depends upon reputation, as much as
upon numbers; reputation is gained or loft by the firlt flep one
takes; in his circumflanccs, a retreat rwould be attended with all
the ignominy of a flight, and would at once dilifirit his friends,
and inspire his enemies with boldness. Iln ifcl dangerous cxi- Ilis prudcnt

enabled him both to chufe with wisdom and to act witli vigour.
I-Ie declared against retreating, and fixed his head-quarters at
Glasgow. And while he amused the queen for some days, by
pretending to hearken to tome overtures, whiclh tie made for
accommodating their differences, he was employed, with the ut-
most industry, in drawing together his adherents from different
parts of the kingdom. He was soon in a condition to take the
field; and though far inferior to the enemy in number, lie con-

1568.
May 13. AT the faune time, the queen's generals had commanded her

army to move. Their intention was, to conduc her to Dunbarton-
castle, a place of great strength, which the regent had not been
able to wrest out of the hands of lord Fleming the governor; but
if the enemy should endeavour to interrupt their march, they
resolved not to decline an engagement. In Mary's situation, no
resolution could be more imprudent. A part only of her forces
wvas aflcmblled. I-Iuntly, Ogilvie, and the northern clans, were
soon expeced; her sufferings had removed or diminished the
prejudices of many among her fubjeCs; the address with which
(he surmounted the dangers that obftruted her escape, dazzled
and interested the people; the sudden confluence of so many
nobles added lustre to her cause; Ihe might afluredly depend on
the friendship and countenance of France; ihe had reason to
expea the protection of England; her enemies could not poflibly
look for filpport from that quarter. She had much to hope from
pursuing flow and cautious measures; they had every thing to
fear.

BUT Mary, whose hopes were naturally sanguine, and her

paflions impetuous, was so elevated by her sudden transition from
the depth of distress, to such an unusual appearance of prosperity,
that she never doubted of success. Her army, which was almost
double to the enemy in number, consisted chiefly of the Hamil-
tons and their dependants. Of there the archbiihop of St. An-
drew's had the chief diretion, and hoped, by a victory, not only'

the person of the queen into his hands, and to oblige 1her either - -
to marry one of the duke's sons, or at Ieaf to commit tlhe
chief direcion of her afl'tirs to hims!elf. I-lis ambition proved
fatal to the queen, to himielf, and to his family '.

MIARY'S imprudence in resolving to fight, was not greater than Batte of

the ill conduct of her generals in the battle. Between the two
armies, and on the road towards Dunbarton, there was an emi-
nence called Langfide Hill. This the regent had the precaution
to seize, and polled his troops in a finall villagc, and amnonf some
gardens and inclofurcs adjacent. In this advantageous fituaitioi
he waited the approach of the enemy, whofle iuperiority in cavalry
could be of no benefit to them on such broken ground. The
H-amiltons, vwho composed the vanguard, ran so eagerly to the
attack, that they put themselves out of breath, and left the main
battle far behind. The encounter of the ipearmen was fierce and
desperate; but as the forces of the Hamiltons were cxpoedl, on
the one flank, to a continued fire fiom a body of mufiluetecrs,
attacked on the other by the regent's molt choice troops, and not
supported by the reft of the queen's army, they were loon obliged The queen's

vitories, in a civil war, and among a fierce people, have been
pursued with less violence, or attended with lel's bloodihed. Three
hundred fell in the field: in the flight almost none were killed.
The regent and his principal officers rode about, beseeching the
soldiers to spare their countrymen. The number of prisoners
was great, and among them many persons of dillinaion. The
regent marched back to Glasgow, and returned public thanks

Her flight. DURING the engagement, Mary flood on a hill, at no great

diflance, and beheld all that pasted in the field, with such emo-
tions of mind as are not easily described. When flie law the army,

lwhich was her last hope, thrown into irretrievable confulriol,

TIESE revolutions in Mary's fortune had been no less rapid than

singular. In the fliort space of eleven days, lhe had been a prisoner
at the mercy of her most inveterate enemies ; flle had seen a
powerful army under her command, and a numerous train of
noblcs at her devotion: and now Ihe was obliged to fly, in the
utmofl- danger of her life, and to lurk, with a few attendants, in a
corner of her kingdom. Not thinking- herself safe, even in that
retreat, her fears impelled her to an adion, the most unadvised,
as well as the most unfortunate in her whole life. This was her
retiring into England, a flep which, on many accounts, ought to
have appeared to her rash and dangerous.

fumption of success might not embolden them to proceed. To
attempt escaping into France was dangerous, and in her situation
almost impossible; nor could she bear the thoughts of appearing
as an exile and a fugitive in that kingdom where she had once
enjoyed all the splendour of a queen. England remained her
only aiylun ; and in spite of the entreaties of lord Herries,
Fleming, and her other attendants, who conjured her, even on
their knees, not to confide in Elizabeth's promises or generosity,
her infatuation was invincible, and fle resolved to fly thither.

Iofs of her liberty, or of her life, had fled from their violcnce, B3 0O IK
and thrown herself into the arms of her ncareRf neighbour and '--.--
ally, from whom file had received repeated affuranccs of fiiendflip
and protecion. Thele circumstances entitled her to refpcca and
to compafiion, and required that llhe fiould cither be rcftorcd to
lher own kingdom, or at leaRl be left at full liberty to seek aid
from any other quarter. But with Elizabeth and her counsellors
the question was not, what was most just or generous, but what
was most beneficial to herfclf, and to the Englilh nation. Three
different resolutions might have been taken, with regard to the
queen of Scots. To reinstate her in her throne, was one; to
allow her to retire into France, was another; to detain her in
England, was a third. Each of thele drew confequcnces after it,
of the utmost importance, which were examined, as appears from
papers flill extant ", with that minute accuracy which Elizabeth's
ministers employed in all their consultations upon affairs of
moment.

To restore Mary to the full exercise of the royal authority in

Scotland, they observed, would render her more powerful than
ever. The nobles who were molt firmly attached to the Englifih
interest would quickly feel the utmost weight of her resentment.
As the gratitude of princes is seldom strong or lasting, regard to
her own interest might soon efface the memory of her obligations
to Elizabeth, and prompt her to renew the alliance of the Scottilh
nation with France, and revive her own pretensions to the English
crown. Nor was it possible to fetter and circumscribe the Scottifhi
queen by any conditions that would prevent these dangers. Her
party in Scotland was numerous and powerful. Her return, even

n Anders. vol. iv. 34. 99, I02.
VOL. I, 3 F without

B 00 K without any support from England, would inspire her friends with

V.
'-r---' new zeal and courage; a single vicory might give them the

superiority, which they had loft by a single defeat, and render
Mary a more formidable rival than ever to Elizabeth.

TnIE dangers arising from suffering Mary to return into France,.

were no less obvious. The French king could not refuse his
afiflance towards restoring his fifler and ally to her throne. Eli-
zabeth would once more fee a foreign army in the island, over-
awing the Scots, and ready to enter her kingdom; and if the
commotions in France, on account of religion, were fettled, the
princes of Lorrain might resume their ambitious projects, and the
united forces of France and Scotland might invade England where
it is weakest and most defenceless.

Resolves to NOTHING therefore remained but to detain her in England;
etain hedr i and to permit her either to live at liberty there, or to confine her

in a prison. The former was a dangerous experiment. Her
court would become a place of resort to all the Roman catholics,
to the difaffe&ed, and to the lovers of innovation. Though Eli-
zabeth asseted to represent Mary's pretensions to the English
crown as altogether extravagant and ill-founded, the was not igno-
rant that they did not appear in that light to the nation, and that
many thought them preferable even to her own title. If the
aciviry of her emissaries had gained her so many abettors, her
own personal influence was much more to be dreaded; her
beauty, her address, her sufferings, by the admiration and pity
which they would excite, could not fail of making many converts
to her party °.

IT

IT was indeed to be apprehended, that the treating Mary as a 0 o0 K

prisoner would excite universal indignation agalnfl Elizabcth, and * .---
that by this unexampled severity towards a queen, who implored,
and to whom Ihe had promised her proteaion, file would forfeit
the praise ofjuftice and humanity, which was hitherto due to her
administration. But the Englifl monarchs were often so solicitous
to secure their kingdom againfi the Scots, as to be little scrupulous
about the means which they, employed for that purpoic. H-enry IV,
h]ad seized the heir of the crown of Scotland, who was forced,
by the violence of a storm, to take refuge in one of the ports of
his kingdom; and, in contempt of the rights of hoifitality, with-
out regarding his tender age, or the tears and int-catics of his
father, detained him a prisoner for many years. This aQion,
though derefted by poflerity, Elizabeth resolved now to imitate.
Her virtue was not more proof than that of Henry lhad been,
against the temptations of interefl; and the pofcflion of a prcfent
advantage was preferred to the proipca of future fame. The
fatisfadion which fie felt in mortifying a rival, whose beauty and
accomplillments ile envied, had perhaps no less influence than
political considerations, in bringing her to this resolution. But at
the fame time, in order to screen herself from tle cenfiue which
this conduCt merited, and to make her treatment of the Scottifi
queen look like the effect of ncceffity, rather than of choice, fhc
determined to assume the appearance of concern for her interest,
and of deep sympathy with her fuflerings.

WITI this view flhe inflantly dispatched lord Scroope, warden Ma.y 0o.

of the weft marches, and fir Francis Knollys, her vice-chamber-
lain, to the queen of Scots, with letters full of expressions of
kindness and condolence. But at the fame time they hlad private
inftrucions to watch all her motions, and to take care that fie

Slec offers to NOTHING could be more artful than this pretence; and it was

Elizabeth and her miinflers wished to entangle her. Mary
expressed the utmost surprise at this unexpeCted manner of evad-
ing her request; but as she could not believe so many professions
of friendship to be void of sincerity, (he frankly offered to submit
her cause to the cognizance of Elizabeth, and undertook to pro-
duce Iuch proofs of her own innocence,. and of the falsehood of
the accusations brought against her, as fould fully remove the

Elizabeth scruples, and satisfy the delicacy of the English queen. This was
takes advan- the very point to which Elizabeth laboured to bring the matter°
efticr. In consequence of this appeal of the Scottish queen,. he now con-

fidered herself as the umpire between her and her subjects, and:
foresaw that she would have it entirely in her own power to
protrac the inquiry to any length, and to perplex and involve
it in endless difficulties. In the mean time, ihe was furnifixed

with a plausible reason for keeping her at a distance from court, B o K.
and for refusing to contribute towards replacing her on the throne. ------
As Mary's conduct had been extremely incautious, and the pre- I
fumptions of her guilt were many and strong, it was not impof-
fible her fubjeEs might make good their charge against her; and
if this fliould be the result of the inquiry, she would, thcnccforth,
cease to be the objet of regard or of comnpaflion, and the treating
her with coldncfs and neglect would merit little ccnfurc. In a
matter so dark and mysterious, there was no probability that Mary
could bring proofs of her innocence, to inconteftcd, as to render
the conduEt of the Englifhi queen altogether culpable ;. and,
perhaps, impatience under refraint, suspicion of Elizabeth's par-
tiality, or the discovery of her artifices, might engage Mary in fuclL
cabals as would justify the uling her with greater rigour.

ELIZABETII early perceived many advantages which would

arise from an inquiry into the conduc( of the Scottish queen,
carried on under her direction. There was Iome danger, however,
that Mary might discover her fecrct intentions too soon, and by
receding from the offer which she had made,. cndeavour to difap-
point them. But even in that event, she determined not to drop
the inquiry, and had thought of several different expedients for
carrying it on. The countess of Lennox, convinced that IMary
was accessary to the murder of her son, and thirfling for that
vengeance which it was natural for a mother to demand,. had im-
plored Elizabeth's justice, and solicitec her, with many tears, in
her own name, and in her husband's, to bring the Scottish queen:
to a trial for that crime . The parents of the unhappy prince had
a just right to prefer this accusation; nor could she,. who was.

V.
-------' a demand. Betides, as the Scottish nobles openly accused Mary

8 of the fame crime, and pretended to be able to confirm their

charge by sufficient proof, it would be no difficult matter to pre-
vail on them to petition the queen of England to take cognizance
of their proceedings against their sovereign; and it was the opi-
nion of the Englifi council, that it would be reasonable to com-
ply with the request s. At the fame time the obsolete claim of
the superiority of England over Scotland began to be talked of;
and on that account it was pretended that the decision of the con-
tcft between Mary and her subje&s belonged of right to Eliza-
beth '. But though Elizabeth revolved all these expedients in her
mind, and kept them in reserve to be made use of as occasion
might require, she wified that the inquiry into Mary's conduac
should appear to be undertaken purely in compliance with her
own demand, and in order to vindicate her innocence; and so
long as that appearance could be preserved, none of the other ex-
pedients were to be employed.

TIHEN Mary consented to submit her cause to Elizabeth, Ihe

was far from fufpeling that any bad consequences could follow,
or that any dangerous pretensions could be founded on her offer.
She expe&ed that Elizabeth herself would receive and examine
her defences " ; she meant to confider her as an equal, for whose
fatisfacion she was willing to explain any part of her condua
that was liable to censure, not to acknowledge her as a superior,
before whom fle was bound to plead her cause. But Elizabeth
put a very different sense on Mary's offer. She confidered herself

But this proposal entirely undeceived her. She plainly perceived
the artifice of Elizabeth's conduct, and saw what a diminution it
would be to her own honour, to appear on a level with her rebel-
lious subjeCts, and to stand together with them at the bar of a
superior and a judge. She retraCted the offer which ihe had
made, and which had been perverted to a purpose so contrary to
her intention. She demanded with more earnestness than cver,
to be admitted into Elizabeth's presence; and wrote to her in June I-.
a strain very different from what flle had formerly ufecl, and
wvhich fully difeovers the grief and indignation that preyed on her
heart. " In my present situation," fays lhe, " I neither will nor

against Ier. the privy council, and it was there determined, notwitiiftanding the

power, and though treated as yet with the refpet due to a queen,
her real condition was that of a prisoner. Mary knew what it
was to be deprived of liberty, and dreaded it as the worst of
all evils. While tile remembrance of her late imprisonment was

thought it a proper junclure to renew her former proposition, that

iN order to persuade Elizabeth that file desired nothing so muchi 1 t)

as to render the union between them as close as possible, flhe ihewed _ ---_
a dilpofition to relax fomewlhat in one point; with regard to HIer(i:i.nll
which, during all her past and Iflbifeqlucnt misfortunes, Ihe was ,'.lgrd to c
uniformly inllexil:leo. She expreflcd a great veneration for the ligi;:
liturgy of the church of England ; she was often plrefcnt at reli-
gious worflilp, according to the rites of the reformed clherch;
made choice of a protestant clergyman to be her chaplain ; heard
lhim preach against the errors of popery writh attention and fLcCm-
ing pleasure ; and dilfovered all the fy mptoms of an approachingl
converlion '. Such was Mary's known and bigoted attaclmllent
to the popifi religion, that it is impossible to lbelieve her sincere irn
this part of her conduct; nor can any thing mark more firongly
the wvretchednefs of her conditionl, and the exccfs of her fears.,
than that they betrayed her into diflllnulation, in a matter coi-
cerning which her fcetiments were a aall other times, fcrulpullo!lil'
delicate.

AT this time the regent called a parliament, in order to pro- A, ,;.

ceed to the forfeiture of thoef who refused to aclknowledg the in co:i,.l.l

Argyll and H-Iuntly, whom Mary had appointed her lieutenants,
ithe one in the south, and the other il the north of Scotland, be-
gan to aflemble forces to obflrucl this meeting. .CompaiIion for
the queen, and envy at those who govern.ed in the king's iname,
had added so much strength to the party, that the regent would
have found it difficult to withfland its efforts. But as IMary had

By procuring this cessation of arms, Elizabeth afforded as season-

queen's .

TuE regent, however, would not consent, even at Elizabeth's

request, to put off the meeting of parliament '. But we may
,ifcribe to her influence, as well as to the eloquence of Maitland,
who laboured to prevent the one half of lis countrymen fiom cx-
terminating the other, any appearances of moderation which this-
parliament cdilfovcred in its proceedings. The moit violent oppo-,
nents of the king's government were forfeited; the reft were
allowed still to hope for favour :.

seind his con-
t.lut. perly inftruc-cd for vindicating his conduc, in presence of her

commiflioners. It was not without hesitation and anxiety that
ille regent consented to this measure. HIis authority was already
cflabliihed in Scotland, and confirmed by parliament. To fulfer
its validity now to be called in question, and fuLbjecled to a
foreign jurifldicion, was extremely mortifying. To accuse his
sovereign before flrangers, the ancient enemies of the Scottish name,
was an odious task. To fail in this accusation was dangerous;
to ficceed in it was disgraceful. But the flrength of the adverse
faction daily increased. H-e dreaded the interposition of the French
king in its behalf. In his situation, and in a matter which Eliza-
beth had so much at heart, her commands were. neither to be dif-
putcd nor disobeyed ".

The confer- T-I. fourth of O-ober was the day fixed for opening the coser-

nity of the judges before whom they wei-c to appear, the high
rank of the persons whose cause was to be heard, and the import-
ance of the points in dispute, rendered the whole tranfaccion no
less illustrious than it was singular. The situation in which Eli-
zabeth appeared, on this occalion, strikes us with an air of mag-
nificence. I-er rival, an independent queen, and the heir of an
ancient race of monarchs, was a prilncr in her hands, and
appeared, by her ambafladors, before her tribunal. The regent
of Scotland, who reprefcnted the majefly, and poifeffed the
authority of a king, flood in person at her bar. And the fate of a
kingdlom, whose power her ancefiors had often dreaded, but could
never subdue, was now at her difpiofal

MARY's chief objed was the recovering her former authority.

This induced her to consent to a meafire against which flIe had
long struggled. Elizabeth's promises gave her ground for entertain-
ing hopes of being restored to her kingdom ; in order to which, she
would have willingly ma(le many concefions to the king's party;

patience under her present situation, might have led her to many

cs:ent.l h inflame, rather than to extinguish, the difleiifions and animofities

among the Scots. No endeavours were ufce to reconcile the con-
tending parties, or to mollify the fiercencl; of their hatred, by
briining the queen to olfer pardon for what was pait, or her sub-
ODcobeer S. jecCs to promise more dutiful obedience for the future. On the

contrary, Mary's commifnioncrs were permitted to prefer a com-
plaint against the regent and his party, containing an enumeration
of their trcafonable actions, of their leizing her person by force
of arms, committing her to prison, compelling her to resign the
crown, and making ule of lier son's name to colour their ufilnp-
ation of the whole royal authority ; and of all thele enormities
they required tinch speedy and efcTlual rcdrefs, as the injuries of

in sup.port of lis, charge. But, far from accusin-g ANlry, the regent
did not even anfirer the complaints brought against himself. He
dilcovered a reluctance at undertaking that office, and started many
doubts and scruples, with regard to which he demanded to be
resolved by Elizabeth hertelf. His reserve and helitation were

no less surprising to the greater part of the English conmmiffloners 0(3
thani to his own associates. They knew that lh could not vin- ------.
dicate his own conduct without charging the murder upon l 15he
queen, and he had not hitherto shown any extraordinary delicacy
on that head. An intrigue, however, had been fecrctly carried on,
since his arrival at York, which explains this myflerv.

TnII duke of Norfolk was at that time the most powerful and ntiiigues of

most popular man in England. His wife was lately dead ; and th Icgc' it.
he began already to form a proje&t, which he afterwards more
openly avowed, of mounting the throne of Scotland, by a mar-
riage with the queen of Scots. He saw the infamy which would
be the consequence of a public accusation againfl Mary, and how
prejudicial it might be to her pretensions to the Englifli ficceflion.
In order to save her from this cruel mortification, iec applicd to
Maitland, and expressed his aftoniflnmcnt at feeing a man of Lo
much reputation for wisfdom concurring with the regent in a
measure so diflonourable to therfltlvcs, to their queen, and to
their country; fibmitting the public tranfations of the nation to
the judgment of foreigners; and publishing the ignominy, and
exposing the faults of their sovereign, which they were bound in
good policy, as well as in duty, to conceal and to cover. It was
easy for Maitland, whose sentiments were the alme with the duke's,
to vindicate his own conduc. He assured him, that he had em-
ployed all his credit to dissuade his countrymen from this meaflure;
and would flill contribute, to the utmost of his power, to divert
them from it. This encouraged Norfolk to communicate the
matter to the regent. H-e repeated and enforced the fame argu-
ments which he had used with Maitland. He warned hlim of
the danger to which he must expose himself by such a violent
action as the public accusation of his sovereign. Mary would

VOL. I. 3 H never

B 0 0 K never forgive a man, who had endeavourd d to fix such a brand

3 power, his defiru&ion would be inevitable, and he would justly

merit it at her hands. Nor would Elizabeth fereen him from
this, by a public approbation of his conduc-. For whatever evi-
dence of Mary's guilt he might produce, :he was resolved to give
no definitive fcntencc in the caufc. Let him only demand that
thet matter should be lbrought to a decision immediately after
hearing the proof; and he would be fully convinced how falle and
insidious her intentions were, and, by consequence, how improper
it would be for him to appear as the accuser of his own fove-
reign '. The candour which Norfolk seemed to discover in these
remonstrances, as well as the truth which they contained, made a
deep impression on the regent. I-Ie daily received the strongest
afiuranccs of Mary's willingness to be reconciled to him, if he
abstained from accusing her of such an odious crime, together
with the denunciations of her irreconcilable hatred, if he acded a
contrary part . All these corifiderations concurred in determining
him to alter his purpose, and to make trial of the expedient which
the duke had fuggefied.

farther, whether the English comminfloners were empowered to

government now established in Scotland; and whether Elizabeth,

demands was signed by himself alone, without communicating it t---
to any of his attendants, except M/aitland and Mclvil". But leic
so many precautions should excite any suspicion of their procced-
ing, from iome confciouiiefs of defeca in the evidence which he
had to produce against his foverieg, MIurray empowered Ic-
thington, Macgill, and Buchanan, to wait upon the duke of Nor-
folk, the earl of Suflex, and fir Ralph Sadlcr, and to lay bclore

persons, Mary's letters to Bothwell, her sonnets, and all the other
papers upon whliclh were founded the charge of her being accefibry
to the murder of the king, and to declare that this confilential
communication was made to them, with a view to learnll wxhedr
the queen of England xould confider this evidence as ilfficient to
eflablifil the truth of the accusation. Nothing could be more
natural ta the regent's solicitude, to know on what sloting lie
Ri:ood. To have ventured on a ftcp so uncommon and dangerous,
as the accusing his fovercign, without previoullny alccrlaining that
he might take it with safety, would have been unpardonable im-
prudence. But Elizabeth, who did not expct that lie woul
have moved any ifchl dilliculty, ha]d not emplowcreld her coin-
minioncrs to givc him that tltisfaCion wlichl lie demanlded. It
became necefFiry to transmit the articles to hcrlelf, and by the

WVIIILE the English commiflioners waited for fuller inftrudaions

with regard to the regent's demands, he gave in an answer to
the complaint which had been offrced in name of the Scottish
queen. It was expreflied in terms perfectly conformable to the
fyifem which he had at that time adopted. It contained no
insinuation of the queen's being accefTory to the murder of her
husband; the bitterness of flylc peculiar to the age was conlider-
ably abated; and though hle pleaded, that the infamy of the
marriage with Bothwell made it necesSary to take arms in order
to diffblve it; though Mary's attachment to a man so odious
justified the keeping her for tome time under refraint; yet nothing
more was laid on thele iubje-ls than was barely requisite in his
oAobcr 17. own defence. The queen's commiHioners did not fail to reply Y.

But while the article with regard to the murder remained un-
touched, these were only fldrmiflles at a distance, of no confe-
quence towards ending the contest, and were little regarded by
Elizabeth or her commissioners.

The confer- THE conference had, hitherto, been condu&ed in a manner
ence remov-

sinfter. discoveries which file had expected. The distance between York

and London, and the necessity of consulting her upon every
difficulty which occurred, consumed much time. Norfolk's

her sagacity in penetrating the defiglls of her enemics, and feing -
through their deepest fehlemes =. Inllead, therefore, of returniin- 56S
any answer to the regent's demands, file resolved to remove the
conference to aVeftminficr, and to appoint new commiffloners, in
whom tlhe could more abfolutcly confide. Both the queen of
Scots and the regent were brought without difliculty to approve of
this resolution a.

VWE often find Mary boafling of the fiuperiority in argument

obtained by her comminflibners. during the conference at York,
and how, by the strength of their reasons, they confounded her
adversarics, and silenced all their cavils`'. The diiute flood, at
that time, on a footing which rendered her viEor y not only
apparent, but ealy. H-Ier participation of the guilt of the king's
murder was the circumnrance upon which her fhbjecLs ought to
have refled, as a justification of their violent proceedings againfl
her; and while they indufirioufly avoided mentioning that, her
cause gained as nuch as that of her advcrlarics loft by fupprefling
this capital argument.

ELIZABnETHI resolved that Mary should not enjoy the fame

advantage in the conference to be held at WVcefninlfter. She deli-
berated with the utmost anxiety, how she might overcome the
regent's scruples, and persuade him to accuse the queen. She
confidered of the most proper method for bringing Mary's conm-
miflioners to answer such an accusation; and as she foresaw that

her more narrowly than ever; and though lord Scroop had given
her no reason to diflruft his vigilance or fidelity, yet because he
was the duke of Norfolk's brother-in-law, she thought it proper
to remove the queen as soon as poflible to Tuthbury in Stafford-
shire, and commit iher to the keeping of the earl of Shrewsbury, to
whom that castle belonged .

fation of her fubljets, if they should be Ib detfperate as to exhibit

circumflance extremely mortifying. The regent having arrived
at London, in order to be prcelnt at the conference, was im-
mediately admitted into .lizabeth's presence, and received by
her, not only with -recfpel, but with aflsclion. This Mary

raise objections as formerly. His negotiation with Norfolk had

had communicated it to Cecil '. His pcrionlal ftfety, as well as
the continuance of his power, depended on Elizabeth. 3y fia-

easy matter for her to deprive him of the fuprelne direcion of

by moil of his attendants, at length dctermined the regent to pro-

and had borne the woril imputations in silence, rather than ex-
pose the crimes of their sovereign to the eyes of itrangers; but
that now the insolence and importunity of the adverse faction
forced them to publish what they had hitherto, though with loss
to themselves, endeavoured to conceal '. These pretexts are de-
cent; and the considerations which he mentions had, during tome
time, a real influence upon tile conduct of the party; but since
the meeting of parliament held in December, they had discovered
so little delicacy and reserve with refpe& to the queen's a&ions,
as renders it impossible to give credit to thole studied professions.
The regent and his associates were drawn, it is plain, partly by
the necessity of their affairs, and partly by Elizabeth's artifices,
into a situation where no liberty of choice was left to them; and
they were obliged either to acknowledge themselves to be guilty
of rebellion, or to charge Mary with having been accessory to the
commission of murder.

TIHE accusation itself was conceived in the strongest terms. Mary
was charged, not only with having consented to the murder, but

well, it was pretended, had been `creened from the pursuits of
jutlice by her favour; and flhe had formed designs no less dangerous 5s.
to the life of the young prince, than subversive of the liberties and
conflitution of the kingdom. If any of there crimes flould be
denied, an ofler was made to produce the most ample and undoubted
evidence in confirmation of the charge "'

AT the next mecting of the commissioners, the earl of Lennox Nov. =9

appeared before them; and after bewailing the tragical and un-
natural murder of his son, he ipiplored Elizabeth's juflice against
the queen of Scots, whom he acculcd upon oath of being the
author of that crime, and produced papers, which, as he pre-
tended, would make good what he alleged. The cntrance of a
new aclcr on the sage so opportunely, and at a junclure to critical,
can scarce be imputed to chance. This contrivance was mani-
feptly Elizabeth's, in order to increase, by this additional accu-
fation, the infamy of the Scottill queen ".

MARY's commissioners expreflcd the utmost surprise and indig- Hcr comnii,-

lumnies which, as they affirmed, file had so little merited. But, Decccrb. l
inflead of attempting to vindicate her honour, by a reply to the
charge, they had recourse to an article in their inftruaions, which
they had formerly negleced to mention in its proper place. They
demanded an audience of Elizabeth; and having renewed their
mistress's request of a personal interview, they protested, if that
were denied her, against all the future proceedings of the com-
minioners °. A protestation of this nature, offered just at the

-- --- Mary, and when the proofs in support of it were ready to be

examined, gave reason to fufpeEt that the dreaded the event of
that examination. This suspicion received the strongest confirm-
ation from another circumstance; Ross and Herries, before they
were introduced to Elizabeth, in order to make this protestation,
privately acquainted Leicester and Cecil, that as their mistress had
from the beginning discovered an inclination towards bringing the
differences between herself and her fubjets to an amicable accomn-
modation, so Ihe was still desirous, notwithstanding the regent's
audacious accusation, that they should be terminated in that
manner P.

SUCH moderation seems hardly to be compatible with the fProng

resentment which calumniated innocence naturally feels; or with
that eagerness to vindicate itself which it always discovers. In
Mary's situation, an offer so ill-timed must be confidered as a con-
session of the weakness of her cause. The known characer of
her commiflioners exempts them from the imputation of folly, or
the suspicion of treachery. Some secret conviEion, that the con-
duet of their mistress could not bear so ftriat a scrutiny as must be
made into it, if they should reply to the accusation preferred
by Murray against her, seems to be the most probable motive
of this imprudent proposal, by which they endeavoured to
avoid it.

mitted with any decency into her pretence, while she lay under
the infamy of such a public accusation.

UPON this repulse, Mary's commiflioners withdrew; and as

they had declined anfwcring, there seemed now to be no further
reason for the regent's producing the proofs in support of his
charge. But without getting these into her hands, Elizabeth's
schemes were incomplete; and her artifice for this purpose was as
mean, but as successful, as any fle had hitherto employed. She
commanded her commissioners to testify her indignation and di:-
pleasure at the regent's presumption, in forgetting so far the duty
of a subjec&, as to accuse his sovereign of such atrocious crimes.
He, in order to regain the good opinion of fuclh a powerful pro-
tearefs, offered to shew that his accusations were not malicious
nor ill-grounded. Then were produced and submitted to the in-
fpeion of the Englifll commiflioners, the ats of the Scottish
parliament in confirmation of the regent's authority, and of the
queen's resignation; the confeflions of the persons executed for the
king's murder; and the fatal casket which contained the letters,
sonnets, and contracts, that have been already mentioned.

against his sovereign was examined with attention. In particular,
the letters and other papers. said to be written by the queen of
Scots, were carefully compared " for the manner of writing and
" orthography," with a variety of letters which Elizabeth had
received at different times from the Scottiflh queen; and, as the
result of a most accurate collation, the members of the privy
council, and noblemen conjoined with them, declared that no
difference between these could be discovered q. Elizabeth, having
eftablilhed a fact so unfavourable to her rival, began to lay aside
the expressions of friendflip and respect which ihe had hitherto
used in all her letters to the Scottifl queen. She now wrote to
her in such terms, as if the presumptions of her guilt had amounted
almost to certainty; the blamed her for refuting to vindicate
herself from an accusation which could not be left unanfiered,
without a manifcfl injury to her'chlaraler ; and plainly intimated,
that unless that were done, no change would be made in her pre-
lent fituationr. She hoped that such a diIcovery of her fensi-
ments would intimidate Mary, who was hardly recovered from
the ihock of the regent's attack on her reputation,. and force her
to confirm her resignation of the crown, to ratify Murray's au-
thority as regent, and to content that both herself and her ton

ohould reside in England, under Engli!h protec-ion. This fcieme

Elizabeth had much at heart; she proposed it both to Mary and to
her commiflioners, and neglected no argument, nor artifice, that
could poflibly recommend it. Mary Law how fatal this would
prove to her reputation, to her pretensions, and even to her per-

never be granted 1. Elizabeth urged her to vindicate her own
honour. But it is evident from the delays, the cvafions, and fulb-

covered during the progress of the conference, and despairing of

her own adherents in Scotland to arms, by imputing such designs
to Elizabeth and Murray, as could not fail to inspire every Scotch-
man with indignation. Murray, she pretended, had agreed to
convey the prince her son into England; to surrender to Elizabeth
the places of greatest strength in the kingdom; and to acknow-
ledge the dependence of the Scottish upon the English nation.
In return for this, Murray was to be declared the lawful heir of
the crown of Scotland; and at the fame time the question with

would terminate to her advantage, was now ready to break out
with all the violence of civil war. They were encouraged too by
the appearance of a leader, whofc high quality and pretensions
entitled him to great authority in the nation. This was the duke
of Chatelherault, who had relided for ibmc years in France, and
was now sent over by that court with a finall supply of money,
in hopes that the pretence of the first nobleman in the kingdom
would strengthen the queen's party. Elizabeth had detained him
in England, for some months, under various pretences, but was
obliged at last to susser him to proceed on his journey. Before Feb. 25,

iMxARY, in her letter, demanded that her marriage with Both-

well should be reviewed by the proper judges, and if found invalid,
should be dissolved by a legal sentence of divorce. This fatal
marriage was the principal source of all the calamities she had
endured for two years; a divorce was the only thing which could
repair the injuries her reputation had fluflred by that ftep. It was
her interest to have propoled it early; and it is not easy to account

Norfolk's for ler long silence with respect to this point. Her particular
scheme for
marrying the motive for proposing it at this time began to be so well known,

imputed it not so much to any ablorrence of Bothwell, as to her
eagerness to conclude a marriage with the duke of Norfolk.

the conference at York, he communicated it to the duke himself,
and to the bishop of Rols. The former readily closed with a
scheme so flattering to his ambition. The latter confidered it as a
probable device for restoring his miflrefs to liberty, and replacing
her on her throne. Nor was Mary, with whom Norfolk held a

tioned to her the rumour whicli was fprcad of his marriage with
the Scottish queen; he complained of it as a groundles calumny;
and disclaimed all thoughts of that kind, with many exprcflions
full of contempt both for Mary's character and dominions. Jealous
as Elizabeth was of every thing relative to the queen of Scots, the
seems to have credited these profeflions '. But, instead of difcon-
tinuing the negotiation, he renewed it with greater vigour, and
admitted into it new aflbciates. Among thcre was the regent of
Scotland. He had given great offence to Norfolk, by his public
accusation of the queen, in breach of the concert into which he
had entered at York. I-e was then ready to return into Scotland.
The influence of the duke in the North of England was great.

upon the regent the injuries which he had done his sovereign.

kept the queflion with regard to the right of fucceflion undecided.
The memory of the civil wars, which had desolated Etngland for
more than a century, on account of the disputed titles of the houses
of York and Lancaster, was flill recent. Almost all the ancient
nobility had periihed, and the nation itfclf had been brought to
the brink of defrudtion in that unhappy contcef. The Scottish
queen, though her right of fucoeflion was generally held to be
undoubted, might meet with formidable competitors. She might
marry a foreign and a popiffi prince, and bring both liberty and
religion into danger. But, by marrying her to an Englilhman, a
zealous protefiant, the most powerful and mofl universally beloved
of all the nobles, an effedual remedy Ieemed to be provided
against all these evils. The greater part of the 'peers, either di-
redly or tacitly, approved of it, as a salutary projet. The earls of
Arundel, Pembroke, Leicester, and lord Lumley, fuibfcribed a
letter to the Scottish queen, written with Leicester's hand, in
which they warmly recommended the match, but insisted, by
way of preliminary, on Mary's promise, that she should attempt

The grcater part of the nobles regarded the matter in tii; light.
Those who conducted the intrigrc, had farihcr and more' dangerous
views. They saw the advanta es -which Mary would obtain by
this treaty, to be present and , ertain; and the execution of tile
promises which she came under, to be distant and uncertain. They
had carly communicated their scheme to the kings of France and

--.-_, which they consulted foreign princes, while they concealed it from

5 their own sovereign, could not be deemed innocent. They hoped,

however, that the union of such a number of the chief persons
in the kingdom would render it necessary for Elizabeth to comply;
they flattered themselves that a combination so strong would be
altogether irrefiflible; and such was their confidence of success,
that when a plan was concerted in the North of England for
rescuing Mary out of the hands of her keepers, Norfolk, who
vas afraid that if she recovered her liberty, her sentiments in his
favour might change, used all his interell to dissuade the conlpi-
rators from attempting it k

IN this situation did the affair remain when lord Boyd arrived

from England; and, betides the letters which he produced pub-
licly, brought others in cyphers from Norfolk and Throkmorton
to the regent and to Maitland. These were full of the most
sanguine hopes. All the nobles of England concurred, said they,
in favouring the design. Every preliminary was adjusted; nor
was it possible that a scheme so deep laid, conduced with so much
art, and supported both by power and by numbers, could mif-
carry, or be defeated in the execution. Nothing now was wanting
but the concluding ceremony. It depended on the regent to haften
that, by procuring a icntence of divorce, which would remove
the only obRtacle that flood in the way. This was expeced of
him, in consequence of his promise to Norfolk; and if he re-
garded either his interest or his fame, or even his safety, he would
not fail to fulfil these engagements'.

to Stirling, he employed captain Crawfurl, one of his creatures,
to accure him of being accessory to the murder of the king; and
under that pretence he was arrefled and carried as a prisoner to
Edinburgh. He would soon have been brought to trial, but was

6 more delightful to the restless spirit of Philip, or more necessary

towards facilitating his schemes in the Netherlands, than the in-
volvilng England in the confusion and miseries of a civil war.
The duke of Alva, by his direction, encouraged the two earls, and'
promised, as loon as they either took the field with their forces, or
surprised any place of strength, or rescued the queen of Scots,
that he would supply them both with money and a strong body of
troops. La Mothe, the governor of Dunkirk, in the difgui'e of
a sailor, founded the ports where it would be most proper to land.
And Chiapini Vitelli, one of Alva's ablest officers, was dispatched
into England, on pretence of fettling rome commercial differences

meflages between the two earls. Elizabeth was informed of
these; and though fle fuifetsed nothing of their real design, she
concluded that they were among the number of Norfolk's con-
sidents. They were summoned, for this reason, to repair to
court. Conscious of guilt,, and afraid of discovery, they delayed
giving obedience. A second, and more peremptory order was
Nov. 9. issued. This they could not- decline, without flhaking off their

allegiance; and as no time was left for deliberation, they instantly
erected their standard against their sovereign. The re-eflablifhing

crown; the defence of the ancient nobility; were the motives

indistinCt information of the danger which threatened him- had
been conveyed to the regent, and he paid so much regard to it,
that he resolved to return by the fame gate through which he had
entered, and to fetch a compass round the town. But as the
crowd about the gate was great, and he himself unacquainted
with fear, he proceeded directly along the fireet; and the throng
of the people obliging him to move very slowly, gave the assassin
time to take so true an aim, that he shot him with a single bullet
through the lower part of his belly, and killed the horse of a
gentleman who rode on his other fide. His followers inflantly
endeavoured to break into the house whence the blow had come,

vigour in the adminiltration of civil affairs, are virtues, which o0 0
even his enemies allow him to have pofleffed in an eminent dc- ---
gree. His moral qualities are more dubious, and ought ucither 1570'
to be praised nor censured without great refcrve, and many dif-
tinacions. In a fierce age he was capable of using viELory with
humanity, and of treating the vanquished with moderation. A.
patron of learning, which, among martial nobles, was either un-
known, or defpilcd. Zealous for religion, to a degree which
distinguished him, even at a time when profcfions of that kind
were not uncommon. His confidence in his friends was extreme,
and inferior only to his liberality towards them, which knew no.
bounds. A difintcrefled paflion for the liberty of his country,
prompted him to oppose the pernicious system which the princes
of Lorrain had obliged the queen-mother to purfuc. On M'ary's
return into Scotland, he fcrved her with a zeal and affacion, to
which he sacrificed the friendlhip of those who were molt attached
to his person. But, on the other hand, his ambition was immo-
derate; and events happened that opened to him vast projeas,
which allured his enterprising genius, and led him to actions in-
conliftent with the duty of a Iubjet. His treatment of the queen,
to whose bounty he was so much indebted, was unbrotherly and
ungrateful. The dependence on Elizabeth, under which lihe
brought Scotland,. was dilgraccful to the nation. He deceived
and betrayed Norfolk with a baseness unworthy of a man of ho-
nour. His elevation to ifch unexpected dignity inliired him.
with new passions, with haughtiness and reserve ; and inilcad of
his natural manner, which was blunt and open, he affected the
arts of dissimulation and refinement. Fond, towards the end of'
his life, of flattery, and impatient of advice, his creatures, by
soothing his vanity, led him astray, while his ancient friends stood;

justice with so much impartiality, he represscd the licentious bor-
derers with so much courage, and efiabliflled such uncommon
order and tranquillity in the country, that his administration was
extremely popular, and he was long and affedionately remembered
among the commons, by the name of the Good Rcgcztni
